Yet one group, Islamic State (IS), may be the most unsettled. Since last year, the jihadi group has tried to set up an idealized Islamic society, or caliphate, and attract Sunni Muslims with its anti-Western message. Instead, hundreds of thousands of Syrian Muslims are now choosing to flee to Western countries. IS has lost one of its strongest recruitment lines     that the West is no place to live or emulate. This is only the latest sign that IS contains the seeds of its own demise. Many of the group   s internal woes have come to light in recent months, mainly from disenchanted fighters or residents able to escape its control.

With each day that passes, Democrats who have been eagerly awaiting his decision say they are increasingly skeptical he   d have enough time to mount a competitive bid.

Mrs. Clinton plans to tell voters in Iowa about her plan for a $250 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. She wants the government to stop allowing drug companies to deduct what they spend to market new drugs.

Capt. Mohamed Hussein said the bomber rammed his vehicle near soldiers guarding the compound in Mogadishu that is the official residence of the president, prime minister and the speaker of Parliament. Hussein said at least two soldiers died in the blast and that the death toll could rise. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but the Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabab often carries out such attacks.   \n",
       "281395  People around the world have reacted differently to images of refugees desperately trying to reach Europe from Syria   s four-year civil war. Yet one group, Islamic State (IS), may be the most unsettled. Since last year, the jihadi group has tried to set up an idealized Islamic society, or caliphate, and attract Sunni Muslims with its anti-Western message. Instead, hundreds of thousands of Syrian Muslims are now choosing to flee to Western countries. IS has lost one of its strongest recruitment lines     that the West is no place to live or emulate. This is only the latest sign that IS contains the seeds of its own demise. Many of the group   s internal woes have come to light in recent months, mainly from disenchanted fighters or residents able to escape its control. A new report, based on the testimony of 58 defectors, reveals tales of brutality toward fellow Muslims and iron-fisted rule over daily life.

With each day that passes, Democrats who have been eagerly awaiting his decision say they are increasingly skeptical he   d have enough time to mount a competitive bid. The latest sign of wavering came Thursday when several people close to Biden said his decision is likely to drag on until later in October, making it highly unlikely he   ll be on stage for the first Democratic primary debate on Oct. 13.

The official says the plane crashed at Jalalabad Airport in eastern Afghanistan at about midnight local time.  There are about 1,000 coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan, including U.S. and Polish forces as well as about 40,000 Afghan troops, according to NATO.  The U.S. official was not authorized to discuss the incident publicly, so spoke on condition of anonymity.  The U.S. has about 9,800 troops in Afghanistan, although the numbers are expected to go down a bit by the end of the year.  Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
