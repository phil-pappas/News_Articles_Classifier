Make plans to attend the 7 th Annual Hillbilly Hog BBQ Throwdown & Fall Festival on Friday, October 23 rd and Saturday, October 24 th at BabyLand General速 Hospital in Cleveland, Georgia. This event is a fundraiser for the United Way of White County and the many non-profit agencies they support each year. Great BBQ takes center stage at the event with dozens of BBQ teams competing in the Kansas City Barbecue Society sanctioned pro contest and the \"King of the Grill\" backyard/amateur contest. The professional contest is also a qualifier for the Jack Daniel's World Championship Invitational and the American Royal. This will also be the 5 th year the event will host a special category for budding young pit masters with the Kid's Q. Two age categories will compete for great prizes, including an exclusive Cabbage Patch Kid. The Kid's Q contestants will be cooking Springer Mountain Farms速 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. There will be plenty of opportunity for attendees to sample some great BBQ from some top notch BBQ teams cooking for the United Way BBQ food booth as well as the Friday night and Saturday afternoon BBQ Tastings while supplies last. On Friday, dive into the Springer Mountain Farms速 chicken wing challenge where attendees get to help pick the \"King of the Wing\". On Saturday, there are pulled pork tastings with samples from competition teams and attendees will be able to vote for the \"Best Butt in Town\". A new tasting category will debut for 2015. Several professional BBQ teams, that also commercially produce their award winning sauces, have donated gallons of sauce to the United Way to use for a sauce tasting this year. The sauce tasting will take place on Friday and Saturday. All tastings will operate as long as supplies last. The wing and sauce tastings begin at 6PM on Friday and the pork and sauce tastings on Saturday start at 11AM. Sauce tastings are $5 per person, wings and pulled pork are both $10 per person. The highly popular Rib King-rib eating contest returns for 2015. Contestants will be given a few minutes to eat as many ribs as possible with all vying for the coveted title of \"Rib King.\" The rib eaters are encouraged to gather donations for the United Way for a special advantage of a head start or extra ribs added to their final count. Dustin Procter of Cleveland MMA & Fitness was one of the contestants that tied for first place last year and will be returning to defend his title. The rib eating contest will take place at noon. The United Way of White County will also be selling raffle tickets for several amazing prizes including a 7 cubic foot freezer & 100 pounds of Springer Mountain Farms速 delivered to your door, a custom fire pit from Deep South Smokers and more.
