Crossing intersections, we made a sharp U-turn, scattering motorbikes, and squawking, balding chickens while a water buffalo grazing on the verge raised a disinterested head. The youth leapt out of the moving bus and caught up again, passing a pack of White Horse cigarettes to the driver, along with a murky drink in a plastic bag with straw. Horn blaring we continued, the youth yelling and gesticulating through the open window at anybody standing at the roadside. Spotting a target, he jumped out of the door and, after a brief exchange, pulled a resisting girl towards the bus, slinging her rucksack behind us. An abrupt halt at a café and a motorbike was loaded on top of our luggage, its rider, sporting an Elvis haircut and long-nailed fingers, climbing into the front seat. We began to realise why this was costing us $9 each as opposed to the $180 for the rented car that took us to Kon Tum the day before. • Vietnam: news, features and guides A road outside of Kon Tum, Vietnam Photo: Alamy We still hadn’t left town when two women boarded with polystyrene boxes, a basket of rambutans, two conical hats and a cardboard box punched with holes, from which came a disturbing silence. At the city limits the driver killed the engine. We alighted and the men offered each other cigarettes. Correctly suspecting this might be the last stop for five hours, I asked: “Toilet?” Incomprehension. We unearthed Point It and flicked through the photos of everything you could need when abroad. I showed them a picture of a lavatory. Amid gales of laughter, they indicated a nearby cassava field offering little cover. Behind me was the gate of a courtyard with lots of doors, possibly alms houses. A chipped bas-relief mural featured a flowering tree, a stream, a pink dragon. I entered. A young girl was sullenly sweeping: “Toilet?” I asked. She turned away. Rounding a corner I met a large man who barked aggressively at me. Timidly, I showed him the Point It picture. Western would be perfect, but squat ’n’ drop would suffice, I mimed. He gestured towards a small building where I availed myself of the spotless non-Western facilities, washing my hands in the sink outside. Shaking my hands dry, I headed back to the waiting throng, where C, who had relieved himself in the cassava field with the other smug men (and possibly the less-inhibited women), glanced around the courtyard and remarked: “You realise it’s a brothel?” Enter the next round Email your entry, in 500 words (with the text in the body of the email), to justback@telegraph.co.uk by midnight on Tuesday, October 20.
