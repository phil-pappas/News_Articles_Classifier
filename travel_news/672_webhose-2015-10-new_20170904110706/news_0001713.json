Sylvester was advised by Prateek Mishrapuri to perform shradh to ensure peace to the dear departed. Fearing that his visit would attract unwanted media attention, the actor sent his family members; his half-brother Michael, his wife and two others to perform the rituals.\nSylvester’s half-brother, his wife and two others made a secret visit to Kankhal, Haridwar and performed ‘tithi shradh’, which is done for those who die in an accident or murder. After the rituals were done, the family members returned to Philadelphia.\nEarlier, Sylvester revealed that it was tough coming to terms with his son’s sudden death and that he had attempted to get in touch with séances to talk with his departed son. In his search of a medium, he approached Mishrapuri. On his visit to Los Angeles, Sylvester learnt of the Hindi ritual of ‘shradh’ from Mishrapuri.\n entertainment Hollywood Sylvester Stallone Also Read Sidharth and Alia to play siblings in Karan Johar's next Vashu Bhagnani to celebrate 25 movies as an independent producer George Clooney gives up serial romance for engagement Angelina Jolie made an honorary dame by the Queen", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Sylvester-Stallone-has-lost-a-son.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151014/entertainment-bollywood/article/sylvester-stallone-sends-family-members-haridwar-perform-his", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Sylvester-Stallone-has-lost-a-son.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:35:49.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
