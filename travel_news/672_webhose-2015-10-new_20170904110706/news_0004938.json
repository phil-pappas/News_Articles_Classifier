The Catalunya Convention Bureau event, held at the Barcelona International Convention Centre on 29 September, was organised to promote economic activity in the region with an event content focus on innovation and co-creation in the MICE sector. \nThe bureau was seeking a solution for business match-making, networking, and exhibitor lead-generation at the event. Poken’s 360° event technology platform provided one single, web-based configurable event management tool that could address all requirements. Poken also provided an integrated fully branded mobile event app, allowing participants to review personal meeting schedules and take notes during their meetings. Incentivisation and gamification was brought to a new level through big-screen live media generated from real-time activity tracking, encouraging people to participate actively in the event and have a chance at winning recognition as the most successful at scheduling business meetings, or connecting with participants. For the one day event there were over 7,900 interactions logged between participants, where business cards and digital documents were exchanged through Poken’s digital networking technology. Director of the Catalunya Convention Bureau, Sonia Serracarbasa, said: “We were happy to find a technology solution that could bring together networking, match-making, exhibitor lead-generation and incentivisation, all in one. “Setting up the event was simple, and we achieved fantastic results. For a public administration to be able to conduct a sustainable ‘green event’ on top of that, is just amazing.\" Poken CEO, Stephane Doutriaux, added: “It was great to work with Catalunya Convention Bureau on such a valuable event. The participants took well to the tools and incentives, helping everyone align their objectives towards better business outcomes. We embrace the challenges that organisers face when facilitating match-making and business meetings scheduling in short events. With our online platform, in a sense the event starts a week or two earlier, maximising the time participants have to get to know each-other. ” Related articles Alton Towers Resorts’ Toni Mountford selected for miaList 2015 Alton Towers Resort has announced that Toni Mountford, Corporate Sales & Events Team Leader for the Resort has been selected for the prestigio...
