Azul, the large independent Brazilian airline, is selling two new airpasses: 10 days for $299 or 21 days for $399. These are true fly-all-you-want passes, and they can be good deals. A round-trip from Rio to Iguacu, for example, costs a minimum of $211, far in advance, and a round-trip to Brasilia costs at least $170, so if you wanted to visit just those two outlying areas, the pass would be your best deal. But it would really pay off if you want to visit, say, the upper Amazon, where the cheapest round-trip from Rio to Manaus is $389, but a lot higher on most flights.\nThe fine print:\n-- The pass is for sale only in the United States.\n-- Prices include all airport fees and taxes.\n-- The pass covers travel to/from more than 100 destinations in Brazil.\n-- Pass users must fly to/from Brazil either on Azul -- its U.S. gateways are Ft. Lauderdale and Orlando -- or on United, not included in the pass price.\n-- Pass flights do not earn frequent flyer points.\n-- Travel is subject to seat availability and holiday blackouts.\n-- Baggage rules follow the rules on the international ticket to/from Brazil.\n-- The pass is open for sale until November 30, with travel completed by December 15. In most of Brazil, this means summer-season travel.\nTwo other rules limit the efficient use of the pass:\n-- The validity period starts on the day you first arrive in Brazil, so if you want to combine a visit to Rio or Sao Paulo with internal travel, do the internal pass travel first, then extend your stay after the pass expires.\n-- Azul's main hub is in Sao Paulo, so most itineraries from Rio require a Sao Paulo connection. This doesn't add to the cost, but it does add time.\nOverall, the 10-day pass would be less expensive than just two moderate-distance out-and-back trips from Rio or Sao Paulo. And the 21-day pass would be a great deal if you want to stray as far afield as Fortaleza or Recife.\nAs far as I can tell, this is currently the only true fly-all-you-want airpass available to travelers. An out-of-date online information posting noted a handful of others, but I couldn't find any others available at this time. Within the last few years, airlines as diverse as JetBlue and Air India have offered similar short-term unlimited airpasses, but, as with Azul's promotion, both the purchase and travel windows were fairly short.\nLots of other airlines and airline alliances sell what they call \"passes,\" but are more accurately termed \"visitor tickets.\" They provide a set number of flights within a limited time period, usually at a fixed price per flight segment that is considerably less than the prices of ordinary tickets. They're usually available only to residents of foreign countries, and usually available only in connection with an international ticket to/from the country or region in which they're valid. Cathay Pacific has pushed its \"All Asia Pass\" for many years; Qantas has its Walkabout Air Pass, and Varig/GOL has a South America version. Several lines and alliances sell visitor tickets for travel around within Europe: You pay the same set price per flight, or, in some cases, a different set price depending on distance zone.\nThe main problem with visitor tickets is that in all too many cases, you have to pass through one of the sponsoring airline's principal hubs to travel between any two \"spoke\" destinations, typically using two coupons for each one-way connecting itinerary. That's one reason why low-fare airlines have cut into the former marketplace for these visitor tickets. You can fly nonstop on at least one low-fare airline between almost any two of the most important European destinations.\nAll in all, the Azul pass is a very good deal for visiting Brazil. But it's essentially a one-of-a-kind, once-in-a-while promotion, not duplicated elsewhere -- at least for now.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins@mind.net .
