The crime fighter is now able to utilize native Windows functionality including GPS location services and onboard cameras on mobile and tablet devices for picture, video capture and upload capabilities, giving officer's easy-to-use, mission critical tools for fighting crime. \"Built with help from more than 4 million people around the world, Windows 10 marks the start of a new era of personal technology, designed to empower people to do great things,\" said Rick Zak , director of Microsoft's Justice & Public Safety Solutions. \"NC4's new app flexes the power of Microsoft's latest technologies to help law enforcement better fight crime and protect citizens.\"NC4 Street Smart is a state-of-the-art tool that provides real-time data to keep officers informed and protected as they patrol our communities. It creates an environment to quickly share crime-related information enabling officers to stop crime faster by visualizing data points on maps and aggregating and sharing relevant information through situation-based bulletins and secure blogs. This allows the law enforcement officer to achieve constant situational awareness and maximizes the absorption and dissemination of tactical intelligence to and from the organization. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:46:46.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
