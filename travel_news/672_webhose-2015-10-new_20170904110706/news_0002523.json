In its early years, the company focused on making in-car entertainment systems, allowing children to watch videos via miniature screens attached to battery-powered VHS players. In 2012, Nextbase became aware of the growing dash cam markets in Russia and Asia – a dash cam is a small, windowscreen-mounted in-car camera that records everything taking place in front of the dashboard – and began developing a dash cam specifically designed to meet the needs of UK drivers. The first Nextbase dash cam was released the following year and was sold in Halfords, establishing a firm foundation for the future growth of the brand. Nextbase is currently the largest manufacturer of dash cams in the UK; the company is also unique within its sector for having an exclusive partnership with an insurance provider. Nextbase dash cams have won several awards, while the business enjoyed 110pc growth in the financial year 2015-2016. • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:29:40.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
