In this role he reports to Marwan Al Ali, Senior Vice President, Middle East Africa South Asia Operations.\nBefore joining Jumeirah in 2005 in the Supply Chain and Logistics team, Naser worked in general import and export and in a furniture business. He moved on to become HR Manager for National Development, driving the company’s efforts to attract more Emiratis to consider hospitality and Jumeirah as a promising career choice. In 2009 Naser became Housekeeping Manager at Jumeirah Mina A’Salam before joining the pre-opening team at Jumeirah Zabeel Saray in 2011, where he was promoted to Executive Housekeeper.\nNaser graduated from Indiana State University, USA, with a Bachelor’s degree in computer science and electronics and secured an Associate Degree in Hospitality and Management at Emirates Academy of Hospitality Management. In 2011 he gained a Master’s degree in Human Resources Management from the British University in Dubai.\nJumeirah Group, Chief Operating Officer, Robert Swade, said: “It is a testament to Naser’s professionalism and leadership that he has been promoted to his first General Manager position within Jumeirah. One of our guiding principles is ‘continuous growth’ and no one exemplifies that more than Naser.”\nSource:- Jumeirah", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:13:19.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
