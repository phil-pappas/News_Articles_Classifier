Image supplied. \nImagine you could combine the familiar luxury and service of a hotel, while also trying something new and different. \nThis is what the Guest Chef Dinner Series at various Red Carnation Hotels offers, with chefs interchanging between the group's properties to share their culinary delights with a new audience for a limited period of time. \nEarlier this year, we experienced the luxury of the 12 Apostles Hotel and Spa's Azure restaurant, but with the authentic Durban cuisine of The Oyster Box' s Executive Chef Kevin Joseph. \nWhile Joseph was a guest in the kitchen, he did not hesitate to make it his own. \nOn the menu was a malabari oyster, Bengali-styled grilled half crayfish, venison and prune koftas and gulab jamum and passion fruit tart. \nDessert was particularly exquisite and included frozen bombay crush with rosewater and subja seeds. \nWhile still being in Cape Town, we were delighted by the authentic flavours of fine dining in Durban - sending our tastebuds on a quick vacation to another region. \nBeing part of Red Carnation Hotels, both the 12 Apostles and the Oyster Box made sure that the dinner was a five-star experience. \nI was particularly impressed with the extra time and effort put into supplying a vegetarian option for diners. Each meal was just as delicious and complex as the meat offerings. \nThe Bengali-styled grilled paneer, which was part of the starter, was out of this world. Meanwhile the vegetable and prune koftas were rich and satisfying. \nJoseph didn't stay chained to the stove though - he entertained guests with his charming personality and humour, explaining the meals in detail. \nBy the end of the evening we felt like we'd been to Durban and back - but without the travel fatigue. \nWhile the Guest Chef Dinner Series has ended for this year, make sure to look out for it when it comes around again. \nIf you're in Durban and would like to experience Joseph's cooking for yourself, the Oyster Box offers a delicious curry buffet.
