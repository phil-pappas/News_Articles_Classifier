It all starts with premium cashmere yarn that’s spun from the softest tops (or what they like to call fluffy wool from really fancy goats). These super-refined threads better absorb dye, allowing J.Crew to get the richest colours possible – think neon, heather grey, chartreuse and regal blue. The end result: jumpers you’ll have forever in colours you simply can’t find anywhere else. This season alone, they’ve made 40 colours and counting. To enjoy 20% off the cashmere range, come along to an exclusive event from 6.30-8.30pm on Wednesday 21 October at J.Crew's Sloane Square store.* Stephen Doig and Sophie Warburton from the Telegraph Fashion team will be on hand to provide styling tips and advice, and three lucky winners will have the chance to win a cashmere sweater of their choice. So what are you waiting for? Sign up now. *Tickets are limited to 125 pairs and will be allocated on a first come, first served basis. Maximum of one pair of tickets per applicant, subject to availability.
