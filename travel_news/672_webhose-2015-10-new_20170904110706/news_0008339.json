Related Content 10 best romantic getaways \nThe agency, which has removed the word from its website, agreed to stop using the term after Shadow Petoscary, a transgender woman, complained online about her experience last month at an Orlando airport. The woman protested after airport security held her for 40 minutes because of an \"anomaly\" detected when she walked through the full body scanner. \nShe tweeted the entire interaction: \n\"I am being held by the TSA in Orlando because of an 'anomaly' (my penis),\" Petoscary tweeted last month. \nThe TSA replied that it would investigate. \n\".@JennyBoylan TSA takes all potential civil rights violations very seriously. We are looking into the situation now for further information,\" the agency said. \nThe TSA says in its procedures that it screens transgender people as \"he or she presents themselves at the security checkpoint.\" And now it also pledges to review its training policy so that officers are more sensitive to these passengers. \nThe change was cheered by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \n\"Transgender people deserve respect, safety, and equal treatment everywhere. Good move by @TSA,\" she tweeted. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
