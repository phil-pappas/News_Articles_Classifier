It took firefighters several hours to bring the blaze under control. \nHe said some panicked people smashed windows and fled into the street while many others were stuck in choking black smoke billowing from the second floor as there was only one access door to the building. \nAll 17 people who died were Indonesians. Most died from smoke inhalation injuries rather than burns, Permana said. \nThe blaze doesn't seem to be terror related, and victims are local customers, even though many tourists frequent Manado.
