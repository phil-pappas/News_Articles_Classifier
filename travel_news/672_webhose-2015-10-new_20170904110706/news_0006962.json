Yet delays still ensnare passengers travelling through the hub, and O'Hare is generally ranked dead last for on-time performance among the country's 29 biggest airports.\n\nSignage directs planes to Chicago O'Hare International Airport's newest parallel runway Thursday, Oct. 15, 2015. O'Hare opened the new runway and an air traffic control tower Thursday, completing the latest piece of a nearly $9 billion overhaul of its outdated airfield. (Bob Chwedyk/Daily Herald, via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT; MAGAZINE OUT \nSpeakers at Thursday's commissioning avoided making specific promises on delay reductions, emphasizing instead that improving O'Hare's efficiency is a plus for the country's aviation network and for Chicago's aspirations to be a centre of global commerce and innovation.\n\"There is nowhere in the world and nowhere in the United States you can't get to multiple times daily from the city of Chicago, weather permitting, and we are working on that in the City Council next week,\" joked Mayor Rahm Emanuel.\nWith the $516 million runway, O'Hare now has five of its six planned parallel runways. The new airstrip is on the airport's southern edge, separated from the terminals by 20 minutes of taxiing. It will be reserved primarily for arrivals during \"east flow\" weather patterns, which occur only about 30 per cent of the time. It has its own $41 million control tower.\nThe runway will allow controllers to continue to land more than 100 planes an hour at O'Hare even when winds shift direction, said Michael Whitaker, deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\"So those delays that happen from that particular weather will be eliminated,\" he said. \"This is an important improvement not just for O'Hare but for our entire air traffic system.\"\nThe last new runway, which opened in 2013, allowed planes to begin taking off and landing primarily in a side-by-side pattern. But the city's promises of a 50 per cent reduction in delays have not followed.\nWhether the newest runway chips away at O'Hare's persistent delay problem, it does help put to rest fears that the airport would be unable to keep up with growth in U.S. air traffic, said Joseph Schwieterman, an aviation expert at Chicago's DePaul University.\n\"With fuel prices staying in check, we could see big growth in the next few years,\" he said.\nThe runway marks the completion of the middle phase of O'Hare's modernization program.\nThe city and the airlines have yet to reach a deal on the final $2.3 billion worth of work â€” another new parallel runway, a runway extension and a new taxiway.\nProjects completed so far have been paid for with a mix of airport revenue bonds, passenger fees and federal grants. Airlines have paid the debt service on the bonds.\nO'Hare, which opened to commercial air traffic in 1955, will keep two of its remaining diagonal crosswind airstrips. The old runway formation was conceived to allow pilots to take off and land under different crosswind patterns; aircraft technology has largely eliminated that need.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:18:40.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
