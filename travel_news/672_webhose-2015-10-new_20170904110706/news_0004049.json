There’s no global consensus on tests, techniques or tickets – which makes it a confusing business. We’ve rounded up a few eye-popping motoring facts… Western African nation Niger has the highest minimum driving age in the world. No one can drive a car until they’ve passed their 23rd birthday. Perhaps they get car insurance as a retirement present. Legal driving age in Kansas, Idaho, and in the Canadian province of Alberta is just 14, and in El Salvador it’s 15. Some 14-year-olds can barely see over a shop counter – but they can steer a truck 200 miles. In 2013, Rowan Atkinson was the recipient of the biggest car insurance pay-out in history. It cost Aviva £900,000 to fix his McLaren F1 after a crash, a bill three times larger than the previous “biggest”, for a smashed up Pagani Zonda in 2010. The world’s cheapest new car is the Tato Nano, manufactured in India and launched in 2008 for just $1,500 US dollars. Reduced features, cheap labour and less steel made it affordable for much of the population. The biggest car crash in Britain occurred in 2013 when dozens of vehicles collided at a fog-bound crossing in Sheppey, Kent. Sixty people in more than 150 vehicles were injured in the crash that went on for ten minutes as cars rammed into the pile-up, but remarkably, nobody was killed. More than 8m parking tickets were issued in Britain last year. But if you do get a ticket, it pays to contest it. An impressive 60 per cent of appeals that end up in Traffic Penalty Tribunal are successful. The world’s oldest driving instructor, Laura Thomas, is 95, and has been giving lessons since 1938. From West Wales, she has taught thousands to drive, including her own family. In Mexico, it isn’t necessary to take a driving test. Anyone over 18 can buy a licence for 626 pesos (£28). There are more than four million cars in Mexico City alone. Japan issues one of the world’s hardest driving tests. Learners must be over 18, and the test is taken on a simulated course; a fail can result before the driver even gets in the car, if they don’t bend down low enough to check underneath for cats. In which case they’d be feline disappointed... The most expensive car ever sold in Britain is a classic Ferrari Testa Rossa, a 1957 model sold by Derbyshire dealer Tom Hartley Jr last year. The exact price is unconfirmed but rumour says the price tag was £24.1m. A recent survey found that the average British commuter will kiss in the car an estimated 680 times in their lifetime. That’s one way to liven up a boring journey. Here's one final motoring knowledge bomb: driving is easier (and less worrisome) with the AA on your side.
