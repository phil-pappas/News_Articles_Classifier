Since then, the area has been transformed into China ’s powerhouse, a vibrant international financial, shipping and trade centre known around the world. Located on the east bank of Huangpu River, the area is home to the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone, which has been leading the country’s reform and innovation by implementing national strategies such as development of the Yangtze River Economic Zone, exploring new modes of regional economic co-operation and creating a business environment under the rule of law. Pudong has followed the national strategy set by the central government and focused on opening-up and innovative reform, which has enabled it to become a powerful engine, said Shen Xiaoming, director of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone management committee and Party chief of Pudong. In April, the zone was expanded from 11 square miles to 46 square miles. One of the new areas was Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone, which is home to some of China’s tallest and most iconic buildings. Lujiazui should implement innovative policies and facilitate amassing of financial institutions Lujiazui has been given the mission of becoming a global financial hub. At a seminar with officials from the Lujiazui administration bureau on July 27, Mr Shen said Lujiazui had to keep the current development momentum going and strive to be one of the best central business districts in the world. “Lujiazui should implement innovative policies and facilitate the amassing of financial institutions by taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the Shanghai FTZ and Shanghai’s emerging status as a global financial centre,” said Sun Jiwei, head of Pudong district government. About 680 financial institutions have settled in Lujiazui in the first half of this year, bringing the number of financial establishments in the zone to more than 3,000. It has also attracted a large number of emerging companies in fields such as private securities, equity investment, financial leasing and commercial factoring, paving the way for the development of the cross-border financial service industry. Within six months of becoming part of the free trade zone, 1,663 domestic and global projects launched in Lujiazui with registered capital of more than 116 billion yuan (£11.9 billion), 83 per cent higher than the value of the projects launched over the same period in 2014. To follow the Shanghai government’s guidelines on speeding up the expansion of the free trade zone and the impact of Lujiazui in the financial field, authorities have been trying to attract more financial institutions and important functional platforms to form a more comprehensive financial market system. The arrival of those institutions will attract talent and capital Trading platforms such as the Shanghai Petroleum and Natural Gas Exchange and Shanghai Lujiazui International Financial Asset Exchange and bulk commodity exchange platforms such as the Coffee Exchange have been put into operation. More licensed financial institutions have shown a willingness to set up subsidiary companies after government departments have simplified the policies on supervision and approval procedures for launching subsidiaries. “The arrival of those institutions will attract talent and capital, further promote the upgrading of the regional financial market system and boost its core competence as a global financial hub,” said Wang Hua, deputy director of Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Management Committee. Martyn Parker, chairman of global partnerships at Swiss Re, said at the 2015 Lujiazui Forum on June 26 and 27: “Shanghai has the potential to become an international financial centre by tapping the massive prospects of the free trade zone. The city also has plans to establish the world’s first insurance exchange.” He added that Shanghai would create more financial derivatives for trading, help insurers invest in long-term infrastructure projects and continue to develop a bond market to offer liquidity. Accelerating co-operation between online businesses and financial services will be another focus for Lujiazui. Lenovo, Wanda, Haier, Xiaomi and other well-known companies in various industries have set up internet financial platforms in Lujiazui. We aim to encourage traditional enterprises to set up online financial platforms The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has separated its internet financial services to introduce a cloud financial service. Internet financial companies under leading banks such as Everbright have also been launched in the area. “We aim to encourage traditional enterprises to set up online financial platforms to support financial institutions to get online, boost the efficiency and capability of the services and help internet companies to get involved with financial business,” said Mr Wang. The upgrading of headquarters and the growth of private enterprises to form a global resource configuration in the zone has also been put into the long-term plan for Pudong. By the end of last year, 372 companies had global or regional headquarters in Pudong district, including 229 multinationals. Mr Wang said the district, especially Lujiazui, is keen to attract more multinationals to set up headquarters and expand their businesses, bringing with them talent and resources. To support the expansion of local private companies, more policies and measures would be established to attract more top 500 companies to settle in Lujiazui. “These previously small and medium-sized private enterprises have become key players, bringing innovation and financial development into the region,” added Mr Shen. • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:43:45.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
