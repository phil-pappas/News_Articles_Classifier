Approximately 300 CSX contract and management employees who work at the facilities and in support roles will be affected.\nOperations in Erwin primarily served coal trains moving from the Central Appalachian coal fields, and the diminished traffic levels no longer support the activities performed there. The combination of low natural gas prices and regulatory action has significantly decreased CSX's coal movements over the past four years, with more than $1 billion in coal revenue declines during that time.\nAffected employees at Erwin will receive at least 60 days of pay and benefits. Contract employees also may have other benefits available in accordance with their labor agreements. Many furloughed employees will be eligible for jobs in higher-demand areas on CSX's network. Affected management employees will be offered relocation opportunities as they are available, or will be eligible for severance benefits.\nCSX remains committed to delivering strong service to customers in the region. Remaining coal traffic, as well as merchandise traffic including grain unit trains, will be rerouted efficiently across other parts of the CSX network.\nAcross Tennessee , CSX operates more than 1,500 miles of track, with facilities that include its division headquarters and a major yard in Nashville .\nAbout CSX\nCSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida , is a premier transportation company.
