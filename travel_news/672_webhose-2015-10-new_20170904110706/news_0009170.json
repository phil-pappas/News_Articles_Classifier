American will remain close to its biggest hub, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and keep a Fort Worth address.\nExecutive Vice-Presidents Stephen Johnson and Elise Eberwein said in a memo the two buildings that make up American's current home are older — built in the 1980s — inefficient, and becoming expensive to maintain. They are \"inconvenient and uninviting to non-headquarters employees,\" the executives said. About 5,000 people work there.\nThe new location is next to American's operations and training centres and its C.R. Smith Museum. American plans to break ground on the four-building complex next spring and move in by summer or early fall 2018. The company didn't disclose costs.\nIt was a triumph for the Dallas-Fort Worth area when American moved to Texas from New York in 1979, one of several big companies that relocated to the region including Exxon Mobil Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. American moved into its current home in 1988. CEO Doug Parker had said the company was considering a new home and that Fort Worth had the inside track.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:22:29.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
