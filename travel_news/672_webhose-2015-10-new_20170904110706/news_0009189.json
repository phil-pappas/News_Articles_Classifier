The Uber statement says: 'Our thoughts remain with the victim. We will do everything we can to work with police'. \nReading the story in local papers the situation sounds however a bit confusing and opens the possibility of misleading behavior by the victim. \nThe Uber driver was charged with allegedly raping the young British tourist after he offered to drive her home from a Sydney bar. \nThe 22-year-old woman was walking in Vaucluse in Sydney's eastern suburbs at 12.30am on Sunday when Muhammad Naveed pulled up beside her in a Hyundai i30. \nNaveed, 39, allegedly spotted the woman walking along Bayswater Road holding her shoes after she left the World Bar night club in Kings Cross where she had been with friends. \nThe woman, who had only been in Australia for three weeks, accepted Naveed's offer for a ride thinking he was a taxi driver. \nCourt documents state the victim had been at the bar with friends when she left because she was feeling too drunk. \nCCTV cameras from a petrol station captured Naveed driving in and buying condoms at about 1am. \nHe then pulled into a nearby side street and allegedly asked the woman if she wanted to sit in the back. \nThe victim, who claims she thought the driver didn't want her falling asleep in the front seat, was helped to lie down in the back of the car. She woke up to allegedly find Naveed having sex with her before he drove her home a few minutes later.
