Zion AME Church in 2014. Provided × In a one-two punch, the Gaillard Center scheduled Yo-Yo Ma for its Sunday opener and local gospel and jazz musicians (with special guests) for its Monday night showcase. “Sounds of the Holy City: Gospel Meets Jazz” begins tonight at 7:30 p.m. It features Lowcountry Voices and The Charlton Singleton Quintet, along with singers Karen Clark-Sheard, Blanche McAllister-Dykes and Desmond Pringle. Lowcountry Voices, under the direction of Nathan L. Nelson, performed during the services for the late Rev. Clementa Pinckney of Emanuel AME Church, and with James Taylor during his sold-out July concert in Columbia. Joining the choir will be The Charlton Singleton Quintet. Karen Clark-Sheard is a four-time Grammy Award-winning gospel singer and songwriter. Blanche McAllister-Dykes has been singing since childhood. In 2002, she began working with Donald Lawrence on stage and in the studio. Desmond Pringle, a native of Charleston and an international recording artist, will lend his powerful tenor voice to the proceedings. For information and tickets, visit www.gaillardcenter.com .
