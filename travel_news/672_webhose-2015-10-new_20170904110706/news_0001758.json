As regards the tourism activity Malta Tourism Society feels that there needs to be more emphasis on growth in value added areas and experiences which reflect a sustainable socio-cultural activity. The eco tax being proposed will have a direct and indirect effect on the activity. \nThe direct effect will be reflected in the perception and experience of the visitor and depends on how much attention we give to broadening that experience to give a more unique and authentic value to our services and hospitality while the indirect effect depends on the objectivity, rather than the subjectivity, we give to those areas which should benefit from tourism investment emanating from the revenue accrued through this tax. \nMalta Tourism Society augurs that we should work together with full commitment, trust and synergy to ensure that tourism remains a sustainable, socio-cultural activity that benefits all stakeholders - the local authorities, businesses and the local community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:03:08.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
