Thanks to its diverse events spaces, its brand new bedrooms and the 100 acres of surrounding historic parkland, Hedsor is able to offer an unforgettable one of a kind experience. Team Activities In A Veritable Playground: Ensure 2016 goes off with a bang with a rewarding team experiences. Country pursuits are plentiful: Guests can try their hand at cannon ball firing on the sweeping lawns or take on a treasure hunt in the ‘Oaken Grove’, allowing a great opportunity for company staff to get to know each other better, especially consultants and freelancers who work remotely or part-time. Orienteering, clay pigeon shooting, archery, fishing or quad bike riding can be coordinated, and for thrill seekers the ground’s 4x4 track is the ultimate adrenaline-filled experience. Personal trainers are available for private or group military fitness sessions in the grounds, setting you up with the best intentions for turning over that new leaf. If the weather is not playing ball, energy-boosting indoor workouts can be booked including Yoga, Pilates and Tai Chi, leaving participants feeling strong, sculpted and totally revitalised. For those wishing to make rather than break resolutions watercolour-painting classes, taught by a local artist, take place in the house’s Boudoir room. Wine, port and cheese tastings as well as film-making classes can be booked too, enabling guests to learn a new skill and expand their knowledge during their visit. Working with a number of recommended partners, Hedsor is able to deliver any number of desired team activities, however weird and wonderful!
