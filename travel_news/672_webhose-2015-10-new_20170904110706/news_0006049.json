For those consumers who were attracted to the Uber app because they can use it in different cities, there would have been an alternative.”\nCabcharge shares had slid more than two per cent on the news at midday on Monday.\nIn a statement, an Uber spokesman said: “We welcome the ACCC’s decision to put consumers first and reject the taxi industry’s latest attempt to shut out competition.\n“With the arrival of competition in the point to point transport industry, choice and opportunity has been opened up to consumers like never before.\n“Millions of Australians are choosing alternatives like ridesharing and enjoying the safety, reliability and affordability that it provides. We look forward to seeing regulations that reflect these choices across all states and territories in the very near future.”\nThe ACCC has invited ihail to respond to its concerns before it makes its final decision.\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\n— with AAP\nJump back to top\nbusiness breaking news 22:27 PM Newcrest shares down after output fall 18:42 PM Aldi plays with trendier store decor 16:57 PM Aurizon's haulage volumes fall 16:57 PM Customers to pay for FSI recommendations 16:48 PM Positive start to year for Beacon Lighting", "external_links": ["http://mozo.com.au/credit-cards", "http://news-assets.mozo.com.au/images/mozo-powered-mini.gif", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.mozo.com.au/news/n-business", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d9d117382c17a744dbcc86b7fdee52db", "http://registers.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/1186905/fromItemId/278039", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:05:03.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
