Famed Italian cyclist Gino Bartoli worked secretly to transport documents that would help Jews escape Nazi-occupied Italy. Provided × Award-winning American filmmaker Oren Jacoby wrote and directed “My Italian Secret: The Forgotten Heroes,” a documentary about courageous Italians who, during the Nazi occupation of Italy, helped save thousands of Jews. In some cases people hid Jewish families in their homes; in other cases an entire village, or a convent, colluded to hide Jews, often hundreds of them, while also helping them obtain documents to leave the country Among the unsung heroes Jacoby highlights are Dr. Giovanni Borromeo, who invented a fatal contagious illness to hide the fact that he was protecting hundreds of Jews in his Roman hospital, and Italian cyclist Gino Bartali, who ferried fake documents between printing presses and convents in the frame of his bike, right under the eyes of fans and authorities. Though some 7,700 Italian Jews were killed, 80 percent of native and refugee Jews there survived. Jacoby studied filmmaking in Italy during his youth and has explored anti-Semitism in his work. The Post and Courier asked him about his new project. Q: How was this project born? A: The film grew out of one man’s passion for an idea — a man by the name of Joe Perella (director of the Italy and the Holocaust Foundation, which funded the film). He had read an article in the Wall Street Journal titled “An Army of Schindlers,” and he was intrigued by the idea that the moral choices of ordinary people could change the course of history. ... And unlike the rest of Europe during the war, in Italy the course of history had run very differently and people had stood up to the Fascists and to the Nazis. Q: Was it difficult to reconstruct the stories of these heroes? A: The best stories are first-person stories with living characters, so it was important to find people who could tell first-person stories. ... Here you are experiencing first person memories, albeit as children. The reconstruction was about the process of memory and the coming to terms with traumatic experiences from their childhood. I like the idea of children being unbiased witnesses to history ... and 70 years after the war, this is really the last opportunity to tell this story. Q: This tells of a different side of history. A: Part of the challenge of working on this film was to show the historic heroism but also in the context of the greater complexity of the war ... and that many bad things did also happen to Jews in Italy. ... In our generation we saw lots of pictures of concentration camps and bodies being bulldozed. ... Now this history is also about survivors and the fact that there were people who made a different moral choice ... and no one has talked about that. ... In Italy they showed this movie on the opening night of the Rome Film Festival and it was a huge sensation. Q: Culturally, did you find that there was something peculiarly Italian about this story? A: Yes. A core element in all of the human stories in this film is the Italian ingenuity, the cleverness, and the thwarting of authority. ... Whatever the authorities tell you to do, you want to do the opposite. Q: What was particularly moving to you about these people’s stories? A: Each of the rescues in the film was very different (some Jews were helped by a single family, others by an unexpected authority figure like a Carabiniere, or by the Catholic Church), but most of them were the result of a whole community acting together. All it would have taken was one snitch to betray the secret and destroy everything. And then many people would have been killed. What was most moving was the fact that people simply did this — risked their lives — without knowing why or without being able to articulate why. They simply did it because it was the right thing — they couldn’t do otherwise. ... I couldn’t help asking myself and wondering about those around me: Would we risk our lives to save a stranger? I don’t know. Q: Tell us of something surprising you learned. When people have a story that has been plugged up for a very long time they are so grateful to finally tell it, even people who had been so modest about telling it ... and the feeling that you are there to receive this gift is an incredible experience. The truth will out, and those stories are very moving to me. ... And there was a lot of modesty in people. ... The essence of their approach was, “Well, of course you would save someone from being killed. What else would you do?” But of course, there were also people who were not saved.
