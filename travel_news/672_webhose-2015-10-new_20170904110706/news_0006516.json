On the other hand, many people with money won't countenance paying for first or business class. Sure, it guarantees extra comfort, some trimmings and perhaps sleep but they'd prefer to spend the money while on holiday. \nIn the past few years, however, many airlines have been developing ever more glitzy premium cabins, led by the cash-rich Middle Eastern carriers. Etihad have recently launched their lavish first apartments – featuring a leather upholstered Ottoman that opens up into an 81-inch long bed – and Emirates now offers private suites with a capacious shower spa in the cabin. \nSo, on this return journey to Europe, I've decided to invest my Qantas Frequent Flyer points, and some cash to investigate all four available classes across several airlines, to gauge how much difference flying at the pointy end makes on the long haul to Europe. \nSingapore Airlines flight attendant on A380 economy class.

However, when that economy leg is with Singapore Airlines and the journey time is reduced by half-an-hour (to 7 hours 50 minutes) by favourable conditions, it's not a hardship. I'm also fortunate to snag 44A, an emergency exit seat, thanks to my Gold status in Virgin Australia's Velocity program, which has partner benefits with Singapore Airlines. \nThe window seat gives me ample legroom but does have fixed arms, making it a little narrow and the cabin is hot throughout the flight. But those grumbles and a poor pasta salad entree, aside, this is as smooth a sail in economy as I've experienced recently. \nPluses include the smiley, welcoming staff who maintain Singapore's tradition of great service, warm towelettes doled out both after departure and before arrival, the Krisworld entertainment system with 294 movies, and the liberal provision of drinks. \nCost: One-way economy via Virgin Australia website A$556.72 (Flights from Auckland to Singapore via Singapore Airlines start at NZ$691) \nThe business and first-class bar on Emirates A380 flights. Photo: Emirates \nLEG TWO: BUSINESS CLASS SINGAPORE TO DUBAI ON EMIRATES \nBreaking the journey at Singapore's Changi Airport is also a relative pleasure, especially when the few hours on the ground are spent in the Emirates Lounge, where I shower in a spacious, well-equipped bathroom and graze on a variety of hot and cold food. \nOn first sight the Emirates business cabin appears clinical in style, due to its neutral colours and shiny paneling. But once I'm in my seat, there is such a feeling of space all around me that I immediately relax. There is a small nook in which to slide my feet, a mini-bar of soft drinks and much storage and shelf space, not to mention a huge entertainment screen featuring the 2000-channel ice system. The whole seat is designed for maximum comfort and is only let down by its 18.5 inch (47cm) width, smaller than that in Singapore Airlines' Economy. \nOverall this flight has cabin staff from 21 countries, speaking 20 languages and those in business class are a glamorous lot, courteous and helpful, if a little serious. \nGiven the staff to passenger ratio in business, however, it takes a long time for food and drinks to arrive and there are disappointments in the gastronomic offerings. A tandoori chicken roulade starter is tough and sinewy and there are only two choices of red and white wine. But a tasty Cantonese-style duck with hoisin sauce makes up for that. Then, after extending the flat-bed and ogling the entertainment system from a prone position, the seven-hour flight passes quickly and pleasurably. \nThe new business class? Qantas premium economy.

Operational problems in Sydney are to blame. But whiling away time at Dubai, even in the Emirates lounge, when you are bleary-eyed with tiredness almost counteracts the benefit of flying business. \nHaving said that, once on board the A380-800, there is much to like about the London-based crew and the Qantas business class pod. While I know the Q entertainment system is one of the best and easiest to navigate, tonight (or this morning) I have nothing on my mind but sleep. Soon after take-off I ask for the turn-down service and staff quickly fit a mattress and duvet to my Marc Newson-designed skybed. \nIt's only after several hours sleep that I take in my spacious surrounds, including bounteous storage space, and try the massage functions on my seat. I'm impressed too that having opted to miss breakfast to sleep, cabin staff respond well when I wake and change my mind. An excellent scrambled egg with smoked salmon and a sizeable hunk of fresh avocado soon arrives along with a proper strong flat white, making the early morning arrival into London bearable. \nCombined cost: Business Class Singapore to London on Qantas Frequent Flyer points 96,000 points plus A$514 Singapore dollars (A$494) taxes. \nFirst class on Cathay Pacific. Image: Supplied \nLEG FOUR: FIRST CLASS LONDON TO HONG KONG ON CATHAY PACIFIC \nAfter several weeks working in Europe, I'm hotly anticipating the first-class leg of my journey, booked using Qantas Frequent Flyer points three months before. At 134,000 points plus over A$400 in taxes, it's a pretty big investment but much smaller than the A$9000-odd quoted on Cathay Pacific's website. \nCathay Pacific don't offer a chauffeur service even in first class so I make my way via public transport to Heathrow. But once there I begin to feel special, checking in 40-kilos of luggage at an exclusive, queue-less desk, enjoying fast-track passage through security and finding myself sipping champagne in the first-class lounge within 20 minutes of arriving. Hey, it might be only 10.45am but it's not every day you fly first. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:47:11.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
