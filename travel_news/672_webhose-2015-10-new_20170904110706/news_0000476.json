The hotel is scheduled to open in late 2016. \nPart of a master development consisting of a retail complex, dining and entertainment village, residential apartments, villas and recreational facilities, OZO Hoi An will offer its signature EAT all-day dining restaurant, a gym and a flexible meeting space. Guests will also have direct access to the landscaped grounds, beach pool and deck, plus a range of retail shops and independent food and beverage outlets. OZO is a select service hotel experience created for travellers who crave the basics done right – a great night’s sleep, energising breakfasts and reliable connectivity to the world and the local area. Inspired by its location with thoughtful touches and innovative technology, OZO hotels are practical and stylish accommodation options, exceeding mid-market expectations and offering value and comfort to guests seeking insider experiences. Guest rooms will feature efficient layouts and functional design, with highlights such as high-quality beds and super soft linen, high-speed Wi-Fi, flexible workspace with multimedia panel and built-in connectors, black-out curtains and sound proofing. Other services include smart interactive lecterns loaded with original insider destination content, complimentary “Doze Off” drinks in the evenings and paperless check-in and checkout. Peter Henley, Chief Executive Officer, ONYX Hospitality Group said, “Vietnam is one of the region’s fastest growing travel destinations, and we are excited to have OZO Hoi An as part of our continuing expansion plans. With the increasing popularity of Vietnam’s South Central Coast amongst regional and international visitors, we have identified a gap in the market for a select service hotel like OZO. We look forward to collaborating with HB Group in introducing our unique OZO brand concept to Vietnam.” Trinh Thanh Huy, Chairman, HB Group said, “We believe that Hoi An is the most attractive spot for tourism in Vietnam. The New Hoi An City – Q1 is the first component for the whole new development, which will offer a unique combination of hotels, serviced apartments, villas and retail centres. The new city, anchored by this brand new OZO, will play a big role in enhancing the destination’s tourism status.” Since the opening of its first hotel in 2013, the OZO brand is currently available in five locations in Hong Kong, Pattaya and Koh Samui, in Thailand, and Colombo and Kandy in Sri Lanka. There are several OZO hotels in the development pipeline, in locations such as Penang and Iskandar in Malaysia, and the southern Chinese city of Xiamen.
