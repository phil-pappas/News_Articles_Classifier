After years of ups and downs, however, the car industry has been revved up. Britain exported nearly 1.2 million cars to more than 100 countries last year and the automotive sector had a greater share of British exports than ever before, 11.2 per cent, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). China was the largest single market for British-built cars after the domestic market. The trade association’s figures showed that exports of cars to China had increased sevenfold since 2009. “A total of 137,410 British-made cars were exported to China last year, an increase of 14.5 per cent from 2013,” said Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. “Only Britain bought more British-made cars than China, with exports to China greater than the combined exports to Brazil, India and Russia.” He said the economic growth in China and a number of other Asian markets had led to increased demand for high-quality luxury vehicles. \"“A desire for high-quality, premium vehicles with a strong brand heritage has placed Britain in a prime position to take advantage of this emerging market” Mike Hawes, SMMT For example, Jaguar Land Rover, a British manufacturer of luxury vehicles, sold 122,010 vehicles in the China region last year, up 28 per cent. China was the automaker’s biggest and fastest-growing single market. Last year, the company inaugurated its first overseas factory in the eastern city of Changshu, Jiangsu province. The factory is co-owned by China’s Chery Automobile and was scheduled to go into full production in 2016. The demand for British-built cars in China reflected the substantial growth in the wider Asian market, with exports to the region having more than trebled. Last year, Britain exported 220,682 cars to the region compared with 60,804 in 2009. “A desire for high-quality, premium vehicles with a strong brand heritage has placed Britain in a prime position to take advantage of this emerging market,” said Mr Hawes. Significant investment by brands such as Aston Martin, Bentley, Jaguar Land Rover, McLaren and Rolls-Royce meant that 60 per cent of all British-made models on offer in Asian markets were from premium manufacturers. The SMMT said the automotive sector was worth £26.2 billion last year. In terms of manufacturing, Britain ranked third for European car production, behind Germany and Spain. But more importantly, said Mr Hawes, the British government was now supporting the British car manufacturing industry. He said the British car industry had its glory days back in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s it was characterised as unproductive, poorly managed and having difficult labour relations. There were low levels of quality, innovation and automation. A shift away from British to German, French and Japanese brands also hastened the decline of country’s car industry. In 1972, when British auto manufacturing was at its peak, 1.92 million cars rolled off production lines. That figure declined to about 1.6 million in the years preceding Rover’s failure, diving to below one million as the financial crisis struck in 2008. \"Car volumes are increasing and the level of investment is increasing. We expect to make more cars in the UK than we ever have before\" Mike Hawes In 2009, as a result of the recession, the British government realised there was a need to support manufacturing and created an organisation solely for the automotive sector to help attract investment and encourage young people to go into engineering. “Over the past five years, things have really begun to turn around,” Mr Hawes said. “Car volumes are increasing and the level of investment is increasing. We expect to make more cars in the UK than we ever have before.” Foreign investment has also helped to revive the industry. Car manufacturer Shanghai Automotive Investment Co took over British brand MG Rover after it went bankrupt in 2005. Today, the company is preparing to launch its newest SUV in China. In 2008, India’s Tata Motors paid Ford £1.3 billion for Jaguar Land Rover, while Geely, the Chinese car manufacturer, bought the London Taxi Co in 2013 after it went into administration. In March, the Chinese company announced it was investing £250 million to build a new facility in Coventry. In addition to generating a turnover of £64 billion, with £12 billion of added value, the industry also directly employs 160,000 people, according to SMMT. • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:43:01.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
