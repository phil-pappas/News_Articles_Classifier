Through Siapa Nama Kamu?, we want to present a cohesive narrative of Singapore’s art history and engage our visitors with lesser known aspects, such as developments in the 19thcentury and the formation of art groups resulting from anti-colonial sentiments in the 1950s,” said Eugene Tan, director of National Gallery Singapore. The exhibition explores Singapore’s identity and links to South-east Asia and the rest of the world since the 19 th century with a total of six themes – Tropical Tapestry , Nanyang Reverie , Real Concerns , New Languages , Tradition Unfettered and Shifting Grounds . Displays will be updated regularly. \n\nTiger’s Whip by Tang Da Wu.
