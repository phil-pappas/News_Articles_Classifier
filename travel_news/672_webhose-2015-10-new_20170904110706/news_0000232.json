More and more foreign tourists, a large part arriving by cruses, want to enjoy the unique atmosphere of the harbour city at the Adriatic coast. In terms of jet set tourism Dubrovnik is considered as a “must-visit” destination. Top hotels are booked well. According to TOPHOTELPROJECTS, the worldwide leading provider for b2b hotel data, more beds will be added.\nThe touristic major project “Dubrovnik Pearl Hotel“ will comprise seven hotels and resorts with a total of 5,000 rooms. It will be inaugurated in five years. The project is part of a master plan called “Croatian Dream” which will shape the sustainable orientated lifestyle destination. A whole dream world will arise, among others with a yacht harbour, sports stadium, an own business travellers airport, lots of restaurants, event and entertainment spaces and of course shopping facilities. The initial investments are estimated at more than 500 million US dollars.\nFor the tourism management the major project is raising questions. Lots of residents deplore a collapse of the city and try to stop the construction projects in court – so far without any success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:28:11.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
