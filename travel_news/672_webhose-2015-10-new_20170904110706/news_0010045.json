As a gesture of appreciation, five of the artists collaborated on one painting called \"Beautiful Flowers Around the Moon,\" created on the auspicious day of the Mid-Autumn Festival. \nThe painting was formally presented to Mrs Jurairat Sirisambhand, Dusit International's Group Director of Partnerships and Corporate Advertising, as well as Mr Stanley Lo, Resident Manager of the Dusit Thani Bangkok, at the exhibition's launch event held on Friday, October 2nd. \nThe project's organisers remarked that the collaboration was brought about to deepen the ties between the two nations and leave a lasting impression through art. \n\"China has had a significant impact on Thai culture and commerce, and continues to do so today,\" said Mrs Sirisambhand at the event. \"It is wonderful to see the partnership of these two nations celebrated in such an inspiring and artistic way. We at Dusit are very happy to have contributed to this great project and would like to thank the organisers and artists for inviting us to host them at our hotels.\" \"In the coming weeks, we look forward to inviting the public to view the portrait 'Beautiful Flowers Around the Moon' on display at the Dusit Thani Bangkok,\" she concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:49:32.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
