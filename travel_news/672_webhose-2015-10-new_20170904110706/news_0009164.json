This is my third time on the list. I have a third, a second and now first,” said an “ecstatic” Leboe, 42, by phone from Calgary. \n“The whole thing is three spots in seven years. All in Calgary too, which is a testament to the city. \n“The city has grown so much in the last eight years in terms of the food culture. It’s pretty impressive to watch.” \nModel Milk , of which he is also chef and co-owner, was second in 2012, and the now-shuttered Rush, where he was chef before he left to open Model Milk, placed third on the list in 2009. \nVancouver’s AnnaLena , helmed by chef Michael Robbins — who incorporates his own Lego constructions into the otherwise minimalist decor — took this year’s people’s choice award on eatandvote.com . \nWinners will be profiled in the November issue of enRoute magazine and receive their awards Nov. 12 in Toronto. \n(Calgary) Port City Royal (Saint John, N.B.)
