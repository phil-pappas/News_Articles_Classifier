Some of the highlights from the club’s sustainability initiatives include a 15% reduction in water use and €20,000 saving on energy bills. This has been achieved through monitoring and adjusting irrigation methods, and reduction in the management of 3000m2 of out-of-play areas.\n“The introduction of native plant species has provided increased wildlife habitat and further reduced water use, leading to a 20% reduction on the course management budget.”\n \nLocated in the municipality of Carcaixent, 35 minutes from the city of Valencia, La Galiana was the first solo project of Felipe Rodriguez of Spanish design company Moon Masters and has taken part in projects at national and international level. The fact that he is also a golf pro has given him that extra vision of what a golf course should be. La Galiana is a good demonstration of this extra vision: a demanding golf layout, adaptation to natural surroundings, environmentally friendly and a commitment to high-level maintenance.\n \nLa Galiana is surrounded by the Corbera and Las Agujas mountain ranges, a natural wilderness of high environmental value. It has been very successful in regenerating areas of vegetation (returning areas to surrounding forest and integrating the planting of native species), recovering fauna (favouring the creation of habitats most suited to every type of bird and mammals as well as a wide presence of reptiles and amphibians) and the efficient management of water coming from its own spring to strengthen wet areas and lakes, which are the biological engine of our course and environment.\n \nLa Galiana Director Rafael Martinez, who accepted the award, said: “La Galiana Golf would like to thank IAGTO and the Golf Environment Organization for honouring us with the prestigious award for Sustainable Golf Course 2016 (Europe, Middle East and Africa region).\n \n“This is an award which reinforces our benchmark status as a global golf course, a course benefitting from an unrivalled natural environment together with first class maintenance and upkeep which makes the players who visit us able to enjoy their sport to the full.\n \n“In view of this and with the upcoming development of a hotel, this project continues to grow thanks to all the golfers who have visited and supported La Galiana.”\n \nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:25:12.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
