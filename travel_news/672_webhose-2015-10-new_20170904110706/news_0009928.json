How do I know this? Well I have had the good fortune of being at the course designated to play the competition, Hazeltine (pronounced HazelTeen not HazelTyne), for the #oneyeartogo press conference last week and followed it with a tour de force of other Minnesota courses and attractions. Media scrum at Hazeltine #oneyeartogo event Quite frankly, barring an act of god, it can't fail! The quality of the courses - with Minnesota being the fourth most popular destination for golf in the USA domestically - is beyond belief and more than sufficient to satisfy any visiting Ryder Cup Supporter.Hazeltine is only a twenty minute ride from down town Minneapolis/St.Paul, the twin city centre where the majority of the expected 250,000 attendees will be staying. The cities have separate characteristics in culture, architecture and facilities but are ideally suited for Europeans who will almost certainly wish to put some additional cash into the local economy and more specifically into the catering outlets supplying liquid sustenance.The urban area is also blessed with a very effective public transport, the light railway linking all the major stops around the area including the airport and the Mall of America.The Mall of the America is a shopping centre/city/destination that more or less has it all. It is one of the most popular destinations within the USA, welcoming more than 40 million visitors per annum which when you get there is not that surprising. Apart from the gazillion shops, with ALL the major brands like Macy's, Michael Kors, Abercrombie & Fitch represented, it has a major funfair with stomach churning rides in the middle, huge amphitheatre style cinemas, restaurants to satisfy any palate, sea life centre and comedy club plus more than 50 hotels within a ten minute drive.The Radisson Blu and a new JW Marriott (about to open) are actually on site and will come and pick up your shopping and take them back to your room â€¦schweeeet. You could spend a week there and do something different every day. The likelihood is however that if you are in Minnesota for golf it will be a final afternoon visit to pick up presents for loved ones left behind at home which apart from the obvious is a very good move given that there is no sales tax on clothing in the state.Getting back to the all-important subject of golf I played some of the highest quality courses I have ever experienced in the USA. Having a shorter season than most of Europe with courses opening up in May but closing in October obviously suits greenkeepers and course superintendents. The speed of the greens, the picturesque nature of the fairways and holes plus the general manicuring of the entire offering makes for a very pleasant experience even if you don't play golf to a high standard like moi. The value for money on these gems is remarkable. I was quoted $95 (USA) for a round including a buggy at Legends Golf Club just a 20 minute drive from the Mall of America. I believe if you played the same course in the United Kingdom it would be in the region of $250. The same can be said of the Classic Course at Maddens and the Pines at Grand View lodge both situated in the Brainerd area about 130 miles north of Minneapolis/St.Paul. Both resorts have splendid accommodation (my lodge looked over Gull Lake - one of 10,000 lakes in the state), restaurants and entertainment. The 18th at Legends Golf Club If you asked 10,000 golfers in the United Kingdom if they have ever thought of Minnesota as a potential holiday destination I suspect that 9,999 would say no. The Ryder Cup and all the media coverage and exposure that it will bring is the chance for that knowledge base to change. More than one reason why the 2016 Ryder Cup will be the most successful of all time.Graham flew with Icelandair For more information on Minnesota and the golf programme visit www.exploreminnesota.com/travel-trade or contact www.cellet.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:06:11.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
