I'll just be glad to see him. He's been away a long time and I'm sure all the other families feel the same. You accept that your children have their own lives, but I like to see him once a week at least to make sure he's okay. This Sunday we'll invite the family round for dinner. We’ll have some quality time with Courtney and his family. It’s been a long journey through the summer to this Rugby World Cup. The players went away at the beginning of July. Courtney’s partner Jess went up north to see him last week, because the England set-up kept him there to keep the physio going on his injured leg. I've not seen him now for a couple of weeks, bless him. Courtney always had this extraordinary ability to bounce back from injuries When they are injured, it’s as if their lives are not their own. They’re just told when they should go home. That’s just how it is really. He’s got to have certain types of treatment every day just to get fit again. I don’t think he’s been allowed out yet and they kept all the players down at Pennyhill together until the end of the weekend. We’ve spoken briefly and Courtney seems to be in good spirits. Obviously, they’re all really down, but I think the spirits are lifting. The win on Saturday certainly made them feel an awful lot better. We’re a family that has never let disappointment drag us back. Even though there’s disappointment, there’s always something positive to take out of it. That’s our approach to life. You pick up the pieces and you carry on. There’s always a lesson learnt. On the subject of injuries, Courtney always had this extraordinary ability to bounce back from them like they never happened. Obviously he'll receive the necessary treatment but also has his own way of dealing with it. When he was younger he had a few injuries. He always dealt with them in a way which surprised me. Once, he got a broken jaw – probably the worst injury he had – when he was about 20. It was in a game for Northampton. I was there at that match. That was just awful. He copes well with disappointments. We discuss it as a family and try to put his mind at rest The Saints looked after him really well, he had his plate put in and he came home. We looked after him and nursed him back to health. I made him plenty of oxtail soup – mother’s secret recipe – and he was back to health in no time. Even as a little boy playing football, he was so resilient whenever anything went wrong physically. He was about 11 or 12 when he broke his leg and he was even younger when he broke his arm. I didn't even realise he broke he had done it. He didn’t complain once. I sent him off to the child minder and she rang me up at work and said, \"do you know he’s broken his arm?\" So we had to sort that out. He’s never moaned. Even now, with his shoulder problems, he doesn’t moan. He just gets on with it, gets his treatment and cracks on. He never complained about his jaw, even though he must have been in horrendous pain. This current injury is a very minor thing, really. It was just unfortunate that it happened in a week of the World Cup, and Courtney has not been able to play since. Courtney has to re-set now, and return to his family, and life with his “club family”. It’s not only a case of us as his family coming round him, it’s also his club teammates supporting him now, too. He’ll be coming back and seeing all his old friends here in Northampton as well. I’m sure everything will fall into place. He’s pretty resilient. He’s pretty focused. He’s in his own world still. He just takes one day at a time, one task at a time. He copes very well with disappointments. We discuss it as a family. We put our two pence in, not that we know a great deal. We try to put his mind at rest. So long as his head’s in the right place, I’m sure he’ll achieve everything he wants . I would say that as his mum. Believe me, mum knows best when it comes to her boys... • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:30:11.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
