The report discusses the major drivers influencing market growth, outlines the challenges faced by vendors and the market as a whole, as well as the key trendss emerging in the market.\nDedicated freight operators and freighter aircrafts provide air cargo trade with more specialized offerings. Furthermore, to handle the growing global air cargo trade volume, there also has been an increase in development of dedicated air cargo terminals. To meet the international security standards, and to handle the air cargo security screening process efficiently, such dedicated cargo terminals establish screening facilities equipped with advanced cargo screening systems.\nAccording to the report, the air cargo industry is vulnerable to terror attacks, and there is an increased need for air cargo security and screening systems. For example, in 2010, two packages shipped from Yemen to Chicago were discovered to contain explosive materials. Also, in 2013, terrorist attacks increased by 43% worldwide. Therefore, the air cargo requires efficient and advanced cargo screening systems to handle the increasing volume, and provide enhanced security measures.\nFurther, the report states that high cost of technology is a major challenge faced by the market.\nKey vendors\n3DX-RAY American Science and Engineering L-3 Security & Detection Systems Morpho Detection Rapiscan Systems Other prominent vendors\nArmstrong Monitoring Astrophysics AUTOCLEAR CEIA Gilardoni Nuctech Smiths Detection Key Topics Covered:\nPart 01: Executive summary\nPart 02: Scope of the report\nPart 03: Market research methodology\nPart 04: Introduction\nPart 05: Market landscape\nPart 06: Geographical segmentation\nPart 07: Market drivers\nPart 08: Impact of drivers\nPart 09: Market challenges\nPart 10: Impact of drivers and challenges\nPart 11: Market trends\nPart 12: Vendor landscape\nPart 13: Key vendor analysis\nPart 14: Appendix\nFor more information visit\nhttp://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7l38jj/global_air_cargo\nMedia Contact:\nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\n releases/global-air-cargo-security-and-screening-systems-market-report-2015---air-cargo-security-threats-a-major-market-driver-300165386.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN36781&Transmission_Id=201510230910PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN36781&DateId=20151023", "http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7l38jj/global_air_cargo", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130307/600769", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-air-cargo-security-and-screening-systems-market-report-2015---air-cargo-security-threats-a-major-market-driver-300165386.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:03:49.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
