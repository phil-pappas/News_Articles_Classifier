Image: Aloft Hotels \n\"Our guests can now talk to us like they talk to each other\" Paige Francis, vice president of global marketing for Starwood Hotels, told Mashable . \nAt present the emoji menu is limited, but includes packages such as \"The Hangover\" - which uses the water droplet, pill and a banana emoji, which in reality translates into vitaminwater, Advil (ibuprofen) and a two bananas. \n\"The Munchies\" and the \"Surprise Me\" are also available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:03:34.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
