Comment By Lindsey Bever, The Washington Post   Lindsey Bever, The Washington Post Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 11:33 AM By Lindsey Bever, The Washington Post Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 11:33 AM Suspended 3,500 feet above sea level, a brand-new glass-bottom bridge clinging to China’s Yuntai Mountain has left some tourists terrified. The U-shaped bridge spans the mountain’s face in Henan Province, giving tourists a chance to see the absence of ground between their feet and the sharp rocks below. See video via the Associated Press: The creators of the bridge contend that it’s secure, with double-layered fencing and a triple-layered floor. Each glass pane measures 27 millimeters thick and each square meter can hold up to about 1,700 pounds. Still, that hasn’t stopped some sky-walkers from worrying — especially after some news reports claimed that someone dropped a stainless-steel cup on the bridge and the glass cracked. “When I was almost at the end (of the bridge) there was a sudden loud bang and a tremor beneath my feet,” one woman told the state-run China Net, according to Agence France-Presse. Witnesses said people started screaming and running to the ends of the bridge. Mount Yuntai officials provided a much tamer account of the incident, which occurred last week. “Safety staff found some small cracks at the exit of the glass walkway during a routine check,” the officials said in a statement. “An inspection has found that the cracks were formed by a sharp external object. The walkway is made up of three layers of extra strong glass and one of them has cracks. This does not impact safety.” Some people, however, remain skeptical. Li Donghai wrote on the social-media site Weibothat that authorities were minimizing the incident. “It was not just a few cracks in the glass. The whole pane had shattered. Saying that I’m making a mountain out of a molehill is slander, and I won’t take it.” Yuntai Mountain’s glass-bottom scenic spot isn’t the first to take a hit. When visitors at Willis Tower’s Skydeck in Chicago stepped out onto its see-through ledge last year, some said they heard it crack. A spokesman at the time told The Washington Post it was only the protective coating that cracked, not the glass. And in London, a layer on Tower Bridge’s transparent walkway shattered when someone dropped a beer bottle on it. Mount Yuntai officials said repairs to the bridge are underway, and it’s closed in the meantime. “Thank you for all tourists’ concern and support!” they said.
