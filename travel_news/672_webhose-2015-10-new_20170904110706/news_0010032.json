The goal is to educate parents about their role in promoting the safe driving habits that will help their teens become safe drivers for life.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273645\n\"We believe strongly that the most powerful tool parents have in teaching their teens to drive is their own commitment to model safe driving. That is why we are offering free Mock Drive Tests throughout National Teen Driver Safety Week,\" said Ben Baron , DriveSafe's founder and president. \"Most safe driving campaigns aimed at parents focus on things that parents should 'tell' their children. We believe that the safe habits parents 'demonstrate' are much more persuasive.\"\nThe Mock Drive Test lasts about 15 minutes, after which the driving instructor evaluates the driving performance, paying particular attention to the ingrained driving habits that could potentially lead the driver to fail a license test or worse, to cause a collision. According to Baron, \" As years go by, experienced drivers tend to pick up bad driving habits without even realizing it. Steering technique, search patterns, lane changes, where to stop at a stop sign--these are just a few aspects of driving where many drivers have forgotten or never learned the proper techniques that will help them stay safe on the road. Then, to make matters worse, they pass their habits on to their highly impressionable teen drivers.\"\nParents are encouraged to schedule their free Mock Drive Test by calling 303-721-8881 or by visiting DriveSafeColorado.com .\nAbout DriveSafe Driving Schools\nWith nine locations throughout the Denver area and thousands of students annually, DriveSafe Driving Schools is Colorado's largest driving school.
