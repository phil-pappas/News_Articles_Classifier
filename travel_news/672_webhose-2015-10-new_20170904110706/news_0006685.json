Denali National Park (Alaska)\nThe 92-mile road that runs through Denali National Park journeys across a subarctic landscape unparalleled in North America.\nGolden eagles fly overhead, caribou climb ridges and grizzlies lumber across the tundra.\nCrowned by the mountain that gave the park its name, the protected wilderness stretches over six million acres, an area the size of a small European country, like say, Macedonia.\nIt's hard to get lost on the only road through the park, and the campsites are so popular that the park set up a reservation system.\nBut it's easy to lose yourself in a landscape untouched by the passage of time, in a space so big that anyone would feel small.\nDenali National Park , AK;\nMORE: Denali summit: Climbing North America's highest mountain\n2. Istanbul\nTurkey sits in a rough neighborhood, with sectarian and politics battles in so many countries next door.\nDespite all that, Istanbul is a joyous reminder that it doesn't have to be that way.\nLayers of the past quite literally peel away at the Hagia Sophi.\nThe Blue Mosque welcomes visitors with a welcoming picture of Islam.\nAlongside the city's historic core, contemporary architecture and art, vibrant nightlife and modern cuisine live happily together.\nHistoric Areas of Istanbul , Istanbul Turkey;\nMORE: Loud, anarchic, scary: My love affair with with Istanbul\n3. Bagan, Myanmar\nTemple time travel: Myanmar's ancient Buddhist complex at Bagan. One thousand years ago, this city ruled a Southeast Asian kingdom that showed its wealth by building 10,000 Buddhist temples along the Irrawaddy River.\nMore than 2,000 remain.\nUnlike in Cambodia, where giant groups come to explore Angkor Wat, Bagan remains a quiet experience where locals in sandalwood makeup and longyis show off the sights.\nAt sunset, small bands of fellow travelers scale the temples' terraces to watch the sky light up hundreds of spires.\nThere are no mega-hotels, no big resorts, just a slip in time to an Asia that no longer exists in many other places.\nBagan Temples , Bagan Archaeological Zone, Bagan Myanmar;\nMORE: Myanmar's crumbling Buddhist kingdom\n4. Sailing the Caribbean\nLike living with pirates, but without the looting and bloodshed.\nHiring a private sailing yacht is easier than it sounds, made worthwhile with quiet days on the open sea and stops at islands that can still feel newly discovered.\nMany provide excellent food (and drink), and the beauty of having the entire ship is being able to customize the itinerary.\nMORE: You too can charter a yacht in the Caribbean\n5. Holi festival (India)\nRrainbow riot: India's Holi festival. In spring, the Hindu festival of colors explodes in the Indian temple towns of Mathura and Vrindavan.\nThe free for all of powder and colored water leaves everyone looking like human jelly beans.\nThe festival has spread around the world (Mauritius really enjoys it) but retains special significance here at the spot revered as Krishna's birthplace.\nIt's a celebration of spring, but to truly take part means embracing the holiday's spirit of forgiveness -- of others and oneself.\nMORE: Holi -- the festival of colors\n6. Great Barrier Reef (Australia)\nDiving or snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef makes the world seem even bigger than it already does.\nThe 2,900 reefs that form the Great Barrier comprise billions upon billions of tiny living creatures, coral, which together have built something visible from space.\nEven novice snorkelers can experience what look like alien life forms up close.\nIt's something to do sooner rather than later.\nThe authority that manages the reef says warming ocean waters have caused huge swaths of coral to bleach out.\nThis is expected to get worse every year, making the reef a visible reminder of the Earth's fragility.\nMORE: 10 best snorkeling destinations\n7. Paris\nRomance and art and fashion and food.\nThese things Paris offers all year, but they're showcased at the Salon du Chocolat.\nEach fall, the world's best chocolatiers, confectioners and cocoa experts celebrate tastes and creations that can't be found anywhere else.\nThis year included a six-meter-high chocolate bear, music and dance from cocoa-producing countries and a fashion show of designs either made from or inspired by chocolate.\nCan't make it to Paris?\nThe Salon is so successful that it's started traveling to other countries.\nSalon du Chocolat , October 28-November 1, 2016; Pavilion 5, 1 place de la Porte de Versailles\nMORE: A Parisian's guide to Paris\n8. Kyoto, Japan\nMoments of mindfulness: Kyoto's temples of calm. Japan's sleek high-speed trains and LED-lit streets take a back seat in Kyoto, the old imperial capital of pagodas and temples, where a tea ceremony can last for hours.\nCasual visitors can contemplate life's mysteries while strolling along the Philosopher's Path, which runs under cherry trees and near shrines and temples.\nReally embracing mindfulness and meditation means going on a retreat at one of the Zen temples, like Shunkoin.\nThe temple runs guesthouses and hosts regular talks in English on Zen and mindfulness.\nNot to worry about being too cut off from the world. One of the monks is an active tweeter.\nShunko-in Temple , 42 Hanazonomyoshinjicho, Ukyo-ku, Kyoto 616-8035 Kyoto Prefecture;\nMORE: Insider Guide -- Best of Kyoto\n9. Chicago\nTravelers who stick to the American coasts miss out on Midwest Chicago's amazing architecture, jazz clubs and ethnic festivals every weekend all summer.\nAn even better reason to visit: it's the training ground for the country's funniest people.\nTina Fey, Amy Poehler, Stephen Colbert and more others than it's possible to list here all learned comedy in Chicago.\nThe Second Cit y theater (where all three of the above learned improv) offers classes to anyone who wants to sign up.\nA full course lasts eight weeks, but if that's too long for a vacation, there are drop-in classes and intensive sessions for even short visits.\nThey also take seriously the idea that laughter can change your life, with courses on improv for anxiety or for adults with autism.\nSecond City , 1616 N Wells St, Chicago, IL 60614;\nMORE: Insider Guide -- Best of Chicago\n10. Drakensberg, South Africa\nIf the Drakensberg ran its own Instagram feed, every photo would be tagged #nofilter.\nThe otherworldly landscape evoked by its Afrikaans name, Dragon Mountains, needs no digital assistance.\nJagged escarpments, sheer cliffs and snowy winter peaks are a storybook setting that \"Hobbit\" director Peter Jackson would love.\nThe Zulu name Quathlamba, or Battlement of Spears, sums up the actual look of the mountains.\nPeople have admired their mystical quality for thousands of years, evidenced in the collection of San rock art hidden away in caves and shelters throughout the region.\nSome date back 4,000 years and are accessible only to serious climbers.\nOthers are near well-trod paths that the average hiker can easily manage.\nThis is Africa's largest collection of rock art, a window into how our ancient ancestors experienced life and nature.\nDrakensberg Mountains , South Africa;\nMORE: Africa's magnificent mountains\n11. Buenos Aires\nTurning heads as well as pages: Buenos Aires bookstore El Ateneo Grand Splendid. With its reputation for tango, fine wine and steaks, many people overlook Buenos Aires's other appeal: books.\nThe Argentine capital is a haven for word nerds (sexy ones at that), with more bookstores per capita than any other city in the world.\nIt's impossible to visit even a fraction of them, but the famous El Ateneo Grand Splendid captures the reverence granted to books.\nHoused inside an ornate old theater, El Ateneo is a shrine to the written word.\nThe seating has been replaced by shelves, but the theater boxes are now nooks for a sample read before buying.\nEl Ateneo Grand Splendid , Av Santa Fe 1860 Barrio Recoleta, Buenos Aires Argentina;\nMORE: The world's coolest bookstores\n12. Forbidden City (Beijing)\nTouring a capital's old palace can feel like part of a travel checklist, a sight to be seen and ticked off.\nThe Forbidden City, formally known as the Palace Museum, is different.\nBoth the largest and most visited palace complex in the world, it operates on a scale that's hard to imagine without actually walking through its many pathways and penetrating the layers upon layers of grandeur.\nA center of power for nearly five centuries, China has invested heavily in re-establishing it as a symbol of the country's historic might and prestige.\nThe two main gates are almost a kilometer apart, with 74 hectares enclosed by a 10-meter wall and surrounded by a 52-meter moat.\nMore than 15 million people, most of them Chinese tourists, visit each year to see the museum's treasures of architecture, art and calligraphy.\nEvery stop inside is a lesson in ambition.\nThe Palace Museum , No.4 Jingshanqian Street, Dongcheng District, Beijing 100009 China;\nMORE: 72 hours in Beijing\n13. U.S. Highway 1 up the Pacific Coast\nThere are few more iconic American travel experiences than a road trip, and few more spectacular roads to choose than U.S. Highway 1 up the California coast.\nParts of the route are instantly familiar from movies and commercials.\nSharp twists, dramatic cliffs and powerful bridges make for an exhilarating drive without a chase scene or a romantic romp.\nThe full drive runs nearly 600 miles from San Diego to north of San Francisco.\nDon't plan to race through it.\nThere are a lot of stops along the way.\nThe mountains crash into the Pacific at Big Sur, artsy Carmel invites leisurely walks and Hearst Castle is a study in opulence.\nMORE: How to drive the ultimate U.S. road trip\n14. New Orleans Jazz Fest\nMusic makers: The New Orleans Jazz Festival is a celebration of life's pleasures. Nowhere is New Orleans' food and music on finer display than at the Jazz Festival, which pulls in big-name performers and small-town gospel choirs with equal enthusiasm.\nFood areas spill out across the grounds with boiled crawfish and softshell crabs, gumbo and strawberry lemonade.\nIt can be a bit gluttonous, for the stomach and the ears, in the best way.\nThe Jazz Fest is really about celebrating life's pleasures and overcoming its obstacles.\nNew Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival , April 22-May 1, 2016\nMORE: How New Orleans made itself better than ever\n15. Wimbledon (London)\nAs the oldest, and arguably most prestigious, of tennis's Grand Slam tournaments, Wimbledon is undoubtedly one of the world's great sporting events.\nWith its fiercely maintained traditions -- freshly cut grass courts, players dressed all in white, ivy covered walls -- Wimbledon is an exemplar of a certain type of old school Britishness.\nYes, some of the pomp can be silly.\nBut there's no argument against strawberries and cream or a glass of Pimm's.\nFor tennis lovers, this is heaven.\nEven for those with a passing interest in a sport,\nWimbledon is a way of giving a nod to old traditions, sort of playing at Downton Abbey, while exploring the many vibrant kinds of modern Britishness that London offers.\nWimbledon 2016 , June 27-July 10; All England Tennis Club, Church Road, London; +44 20 8944 1066\nMORE: 10 things to do in Wimbledon\n16. Gorilla trekking (Rwanda)\nThe trek into Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park isn't for everyone.\nIt can be tough hiking through the rainforest, up and down steep mountain slopes, sometimes on slippery trails.\nStill, only about 700 mountain gorillas are still alive anywhere, and meeting them can changes the very idea of what it means to be human.\nJust 10 gorilla groups in Rwanda are habituated to humans, so they're the only ones tourists can visit.\nGroups of visitors are necessarily small, so this is a trip to plan well in advance.\nThe virtue of the small group is that everyone gets a chance to look in a gorilla's expressive eyes, to watch them play with their young and to wonder how different we really are from them.\nRwanda Eco-Tours - Short Gorilla Trek , Avenue de la Paix KN 4 AV 30 RUMA Building 1st Floor, Kigali Rwanda;\nMORE: Rwanda's monkeys and mountain gorillas\n17. Bali, Indonesia\nWarm nights: Bali offers escape. The island's name is synonymous with \"tropical paradise,\" and with good reason.\nBali has long been a refuge for artists and writers seeking inspiration, which it offers in abundance.\nStunning scenery, excellent food, nightlife and quiet retreats ... Bali is the real deal.\nEven though it's well visited by tourists, this is still a place of escape.\nWhether camping out in a backpacker lodge or a week in a resort, Bali gives visitors a chance to recalibrate by showing its own example of how to live.\nMORE: Six best places to escape the crowds in Bali", "external_links":
