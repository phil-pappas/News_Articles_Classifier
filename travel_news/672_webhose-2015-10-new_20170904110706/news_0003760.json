Albeit of supersize dimensions. I’d watched it slowly chewing a bamboo stalk before it suddenly, thrillingly, jumped to its feet and careered up a tree in its enclosure – a small child beside me cheered volubly at the show of agility. Then, apparently out of steam, the black and white bear came to an awkward halt by a branch and slowly settled into the fork. There it sat impassively, legs dangling, crazily kohl-smeared eyes staring over us. It looked languid and large, yet unbelievably cute, and I half expected it to start waving like one of those battery-driven, fluffy animals made for Hamleys. Locals exercising in Turpan of Xinjiang, China I was at the Bifengxia Panda Research Centre, near the tea-producing town of Ya’an, more or less in the middle of Sichuan province in south-west China . It sits at an altitude of 1,500m in the misty Jjajin mountains, a region not much trodden by international visitors. The centre features as part of the new Discovery tours offered by Wendy Wu, the China and south-east Asia travel company. Designed to show visitors a different China and in some areas take them on gentle adventures away from prime tourist trails, these group trips start in spring 2016 and I had come to preview a sector, exploring the Bifengxia area and moving on to see the nearby old town of Pingle and its surrounds. Britain and China are all about mutual discovery at the moment. Last month George Osborne’s wide-ranging trip to China included Chengdu, the Sichuan capital, as well as Beijing , Shanghai and Urumqi in remote Xinjiang province in the north-west. On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping arrives on a reciprocal trip to Britain, the first Chinese state visit here for a decade. Terracotta warrior statues in Xian, China My recent Chinese discovery was enhanced by the guide who accompanied me. Like most Chinese in the hospitality industry, he had adopted a Western name, his choice of Chuck resonating with an easy-going outlook. Chuck had picked me up in Chengdu, and we had immediately headed south, our 100-mile drive taking just under two hours, which was remarkable given the dire congestion in the city. “Nightmare urban traffic, then a clear expressway in the country; that’s such a reflection of modern China,” Chuck said with a grin as we hit the open road. The Bifengxia centre was also pleasingly empty. We passed just 20 or so people as we ambled along paths lined by thick-leaved arrow bamboo (the meal of choice for pandas, said Chuck) and stopped to watch the rare bears in enclosures so big and full of foliage that in some the occupant had all but disappeared from view. Photo: Alamy According to a 2014 survey, China has about 1,865 giant pandas in the wild; and there are another 340 or so in captivity, the ultimate aim – some years off – being to release at least some of them. A highlight for most tourists to the country is a visit to one of the country’s 10 panda research centres, and most head to the Chengdu Panda Base on the outskirts of the Sichuan capital, which is home to almost 130 of these gentle bears. • Pandas: where to see them in China That’s where I had gone two years before, just after British Airways launched direct flights to the city, partly for business people, partly for the panda-leisure market. I had jostled for space there, watching the antics of more than two dozen of the charismatic creatures. The lush Bifengxia centre doesn’t allow the public access to so many of its charges (it has more than 90 pandas, said Chuck). But there are big advantages in coming here. Not least the lack of crowds. And then there is the setting, which is superb. You’re in a land of forests, waterfalls and weird peaks. The environment is more panda-friendly, too; particularly the cooler climate. It no doubt contributed to the sudden zing of our tree-sprinting panda. While observing it I fell into conversation with a British volunteer, one of a small group on a working holiday at the reserve. The panda, she said, was a male called Hua Hu, who at two years old was a goofy adolescent. Like all the creatures here, she said, he had a cushy life and quite apart from bamboo was fed cake made of apple and carrots, which he demanded in a sort of high-pitched panda-purr. Chuck and I watched Hua Hu make an abrupt and speedy descent from the tree, sliding unceremoniously much of the way, and then we headed to a tea house just outside the centre. What better for lunch than bamboo shoots – served alongside spicy Sichuan chicken? Suitably fortified, we set off on a very green, very pleasant hike. It was downhill all the way. Bifengxia is a designated scenic area that contains a separate wildlife park (disturbingly, the authorities allow visitors to feed tigers through coach windows there), beyond which it offers several walking trails. We followed a well-marked route down magnificent Bifeng Gorge, rich in ferns, bamboos and azaleas, and embellished by brightly coloured butterflies. Aside from a quartet of hikers picnicking in plastic gloves, we passed about three couples on our vertiginous path, which was challengingly sprayed here and there by long waterfalls. The hour’s rather slippery walk ended at a convenient lift that took us up about 90m, back to the park entrance: crowd-free tourism with expedient facilities. Back on the road, we wound down to the northern outskirts of Ya’an, where the Hongzhu Hotel provides some of the most highly rated accommodation in town, with 150 large and comfy bedrooms and pretty grounds – although my good impressions were marred by an alarmingly green swimming pool. A glittering wedding party was under way in the gardens as I headed up the road to the family-run Tu Sha Gu restaurant in a traditional Sichuan house. Here you dine in separate rooms set around a courtyard with lacquered fretwork. English isn’t widely spoken anywhere in the area, so Chuck had pre-ordered a local speciality of spicy beef with celery for me. I ate this in splendid isolation in my own little dining room, peering across the way at a party enjoying a post-prandial game of mah-jong. Mah-jong seemed ubiquitous the next day in Pingle. Chuck remarked that it is widely regarded as the most picturesque of the Chengdu region’s six “ancienttowns” – he ran the words together smoothly as if the composite was a well-known term. Pingle, he said, dates back about 2,000 years and was an important stop on the Silk Road. It’s a charming, largely pedestrianised, place today, its cobbled lanes lined by white houses with black slate roofs and dark, exposed beams. Parts of it, especially around the Lijiang River, are from the 18th and 19th-century Qing dynasty. But, as Chuck explained, much of Pingle has been rebuilt over the past two decades as a sort of romantic bolt-hole from Chengdu, an escape from high-rise, high-stress city life. During my visit on a Friday we strolled along quiet streets fringed with restaurants and shops selling toys and trinkets; we stopped by a great tree hung with wishes inscribed on red paper (Chuck swore it was 1,000 years old); we watched mah-jong games in tea shops before stopping for lunch at a noodle stall. Yangtze River in China Photo: Alamy Pingle was calm and appealingly quaint. But, said Chuck, visit over a weekend or a public holiday and you will find the town inundated with city day-trippers who splash around in boats on the river and hang out in the many tea shops. It’s an ironic twist that this old town now also presents an insight into modern China. Recently hiking routes have been established around villages close to Pingle. The trail to the Jinji Rope Bridge was new to Chuck, so, feeling like valiant explorers, off we set. It was about an hour’s circular walk on a glorious path that runs through groves of thick-stemmed Maozhu bamboo to a 100m suspension bridge spanning the Lijiang Gorge. We passed just one group – father, mother, grandmother and a hyperactive boy of about 10 who jumped effervescently on the bridge while we crossed it. As I stood in the middle, swaying and beating back an onset of vertigo, I took in a stupendous, green panorama. In a country so readily associated with crowds, here was an amazingly serene scene – and in my mind’s eye I added a couple of pandas half hidden among the bamboo. China explorer tour at a glance Itinerary Bifengxia Panda Research Centre and the town of Pingle feature in the China Explorer trip offered by Wendy Wu Tours (0800 9888 209; wendywutours.co.uk ) as part of their new Discovery tours. The 15-day holiday also takes in landmark sights in Beijing, Xi’an and Shanghai, and includes a three-night Yangtze cruise. The tour’s aim is to see China from a different perspective; so guests get off the beaten track in some areas and also see China’s great sights but in a different way. Cost £2,990 covers everything from international and domestic flights and visa fees to entrance charges and many meals. Cash is needed for tips, drinks, a few dinners and optional excursions (group size: 18 maximum; transport: coach, three domestic flights, river cruise ship).
