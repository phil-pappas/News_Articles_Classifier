The small form factor thermostat has a capacitive touch face, and when paired with wireless Leviton Lumina RF load controls and sensors, it provides affordable guest room control for hospitality rooms and suites. The device accurately detects if a hospitality room is occupied and automatically adjusts heat and cool set points based on occupancy, as well as on/off control of lights, televisions, lamps and more.\nThe new offering lets hoteliers upgrade guest rooms with smarter, more reliable controls to enhance guest experiences, increase energy savings, and meet California Title 24 2013 and ASHRAE Standard 90.1 2010 guest room control and plug load control requirements. Five on-board relays provide support for a wide majority of HVAC systems including heat pumps, conventional, multi-stage, 2-pipe and 4-pipe systems.\n\"The Omnistat 3 Hospitality Thermostat offers a strategic addition to our hospitality offering,\" said Richard Westfall , vice president and general manager of Leviton Energy Management, Controls & Automation business unit. \"Ideal for retrofits, the wireless solution delivers an easy and flexible installation with minimal disruption to operations, and allows guests to seamlessly enjoy the comfort features of the room while hoteliers benefit from energy savings and meet energy code requirements.\"\nLeviton guest room controls are custom engineered to meet the specific needs of the hospitality industry, facilitating a scalable solution with a combination of wireless and traditional devices that reduce energy usage and are easy to install. Working with Lumina RF wireless door/window sensors, occupancy sensors, motion sensors and the thermostat's own built-in occupancy sensor, the thermostat's logic can turn lights off when a guest is exiting a room, dial down the thermostat, turn off the TV and more to save energy while guests are away from their rooms. Upon occupancy being detected, the room will re-activate.\nThe Omnistat 3 thermostat can create a code compliant guest room control eco-system for HVAC and lighting/load control by communicating with up to ten devices. Options include a light switch, door/window contact, hard-wired key card switch, motion detector, occupancy sensors, and marked controlled receptacles via heavy-duty load control modules. Free software allows rooms to be quickly replicated via a micro-USB connector for easy deployment and installation of multi-room properties.\nBacked by Leviton's limited 2-year warranty, Omnistat 3 is cETLus, CE, and C-Tick listed.
