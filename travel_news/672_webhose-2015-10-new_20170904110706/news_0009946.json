While that’s great news, it raises the question: how rational and well-founded is their optimism? According to research that was carried out by Bibby Financial Services, more than two-thirds of respondents felt optimistic about the future of their companies. Here we explore the different perspectives of two successful entrepreneurs who founded companies in 2008, just as the credit crunch began to bite and many businesses started to flounder in the straitened economic conditions. Henrietta Morrison Position: Founder, owner, chief executive Company: Lily’s Kitchen Website: lilyskitchen.co.uk Sales: £25m Employees: 47 Sector: Pet food Henrietta Morrison founded Lily’s Kitchen (‘‘Proper food for pets’’) when Lily, her border terrier, fell ill with itchy skin and ears. Despairing of vets, Ms Morrison stopped giving Lily processed pet food and cooked natural healthy food for her. Lily staged a remarkable recovery. Inspired, Ms Morrison set up Lily’s Kitchen in November 2008. “I remortgaged and put £150,000 into the business,” says Ms Morrison. “It was a scary gamble but I thought someone has to do this. I was a woman on a mission.” The business defied the downturn and today, Lily’s Kitchen sells to Waitrose, Tesco, Wholefoods, vets, organic food shops and independent pet stores. “My biggest problem has been finding office space in London,” says Ms Morrison. “It took me two years to find offices big enough for my team; two months later, we are already at full capacity. Too much space in London is being turned into unaffordable, super-high-end residential. London is almost becoming closed for small businesses. I didn’t set up in a booming economy, so I take nothing for granted “I know so many SMEs in the same position,” she continues. “I even raised this subject with the deputy mayor of London. You need to have housing for key workers. The proximity of working and living spaces creates a healthy community vibe.” Ms Morrison’s other grumble is business rates. “I pay rates calculated at 40pc of my rent. That’s a lot, and certainly a massive amount for a start-up.” Yet she remains optimistic. “We are just starting to go international. The opportunities are massive and it is a question of picking the right market and getting growth.” Although Lily’s Kitchen was founded in the very canine molars of the credit crunch, the rigours of austerity have ultimately proved salutary. “My business was set up in the depths of recession,” says Ms Morrison. “Any green shoots now are extremely welcome. Many businesses of the age of Lily’s Kitchen are now able to go, ‘Wow! All that discipline that had to be put into the business, tight cost control, sales and customer service, are all reaping rewards.’ And that is very exciting. “I didn’t set up in a booming economy, so I take nothing for granted. Many businesses feel the same. Every day I am grateful that there is a rosy outlook.” Graham Smith Position: Founder, chairman Company: Opus 2 International Website: opus2.com Sales: £10m Employees: 50 in UK Sector: Legal services When Graham Smith sold his legal services business LiveNote to Thomson Reuters in 2006, he retired to his medieval abbey in Umbria. After two years of la dolce vita, he returned to the fray and founded Opus 2 International, which created the world’s first cloud-based technology for the litigation and arbitration industries. Opus 2’s proprietary Magnum programme allows lawyers and judges to access and annotate court proceedings remotely in real time, facilitating the international mega-trial for which London is renowned (Magnum made its debut in Abramovich v Berezovsky). It has also introduced the paperless trial, since Magnum allows all legal documents to be securely stored in the cloud. “Britain is the place for state-of-the-art arbitration proceedings,” says Mr Smith, “not only for our expertise, but for the technology, the quality of our lawyers and the fairness of the legal system.’’ Opus 2 employs 50 in London, and has offices in San Francisco and Singapore. With the US Patriot Act determining that all legal documents become government property, the UK looks set to remain the strongest market for Opus. The individual will create tomorrow’s economy and tomorrow’s jobs, not large corporations When it comes to the economy at large, however, Mr Smith is less upbeat. He reckons that the welfare state needs rebalancing. “The state needs to look after the genuinely poor and needy but society has to incentivise risk-taking and job creation.’’ Mr Smith adds: “Society has to incentivise and motivate the individual. The individual will create tomorrow’s economy and tomorrow’s jobs, not large corporations, which grow mainly through acquisition, consolidation and job cuts.” And you’ll never grow the economy unless banks start lending. “My son has just set up Juice Smith, a juice bar and vegan café in Cobham, Surrey,” Mr Smith says. “The bank refused him a £100,000 loan, even though I stood as guarantor. One understands banks’ aversion to start-ups, but start-ups create jobs because they are the businesses of tomorrow and exciting places to work.” Mr Smith is critical of the EU. “I believe in a union of disparate nations trading as one bloc without red tape,” he says. “But the EU is constituted like an oil tanker, incapable of innovation or of creating a dynamic framework for business.’’ • For more information on funding business growth, visit www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:57:52.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
