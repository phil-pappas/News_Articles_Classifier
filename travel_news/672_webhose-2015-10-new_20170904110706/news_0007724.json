Each of those places has defined adventure travel over the past several decades, and yet they remain as relevant and rewarding today as they ever have before. But those places aren't the only destinations to define the adventure travel category, as there are others that have lured adventurous travelers for many years as well. Here are list of five more classic adventure destinations that should be on your radar as well. \nMorocco Whether you're looking to explore the vast and beautiful Sahara Desert, or climb to the top of a snowcapped peak in the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco can certainly provide the adventure experience that you're looking for. Visitors can explore the legendary cities of Marrakech and Casablanca, before traveling out across the arid landscapes by camel train, or wandering through mountain villages on ancient trekking routes. The culture and beauty of this North African country is unlike any other, as it remains a crossroads for ideas, with beliefs and influences from the Arab, African, and European worlds. Recommended Adventure: Hiking Morocco's Atlas Mountains \nSouth Africa Adventure opportunities abound in South Africa, which remains one of the top safari destinations on the planet, and yet has so much more to offer visitors as well. For instance, some of the best scuba diving in the world can be found along its 1700-mile coastline, which stretches between two oceans, and across the notorious Cape of Good Hope. Backpackers and mountain bikers will no doubt be drawn to the wildly spectacular Drakensberg Mountains, and no visit to Cape Town is complete without a hike to the top of Table Mountain. With its mix of cosmopolitan cities, wild national parks, beautiful beaches, and amazing wine country, South Africa can provide a bit of romance with your adventure too. Recommended Adventure: South Africa Ultimate Adventure \nMongolia Remote, isolated, and mysterious, Mongolia draws in adventure travelers with its wide open spaces, and wild landscapes. The Gobi Desert is no doubt the biggest attraction, as it sprawls out across Central Asia for more than a thousand miles, much of it still unexplored. Riding across the countryside on horseback, while camping on the steppe, is the stuff of legends, and one can almost hear the thundering hooves of the Mongol Horde, led by Genghis Kahn himself, proceeding them as they go. Alternatively, travel to western Mongolia to hike and climb in the Altai Mountains, where ancestors of the nomadic tribes still wander the land, with few modern trappings to be found. Recommended Adventure: Mongolia... an Uncommon Adventure \nEgypt With its mix of ancient wonders and natural beauty, Egypt remains one of the best destinations in the world for historical, cultural, and active pursuits. From visiting the Great Pyramids and Sphinx at Giza, to cruising down the Nile River to Luxor, the country will amaze and delight with everything it has to offer. It is a place where history and the modern world coexist alongside one another in unique fashion. Adventure opportunities include camping in the Sahara Desert, visiting a Bedouin village by camel, and sandboarding down massive dunes. Snorkeling and scuba diving in the Red Sea is fantastic of course, as is racing through the desert at breakneck speeds inside 4x4 vehicles. But nothing can compete with the ancient temples, tombs, and monuments that hint at the fantastic civilization that has existed along the Nile for thousands of years. Recommended Adventure: Egypt Explorer \nAntarctica Almost every adventure traveler has dreamed of adding the seventh continent to their resume at sometime or another, and who can blame them? As the largest, driest, and highest desert on Earth, Antarctica is a cold, forbidding place that also happens to be filled with breathtaking landscapes, massive colonies of penguins, and endless opportunities for adventure. Visitors can kayak amongst the icebergs, spot whales along the Antarctic Peninsula, go mountain climbing in Sentinel Range, and visit historic sites left behind by early explorers. If you have enough time – and more importantly money – you can even ski all the way to the South Pole!
