The letter points out that the filings are in violation of GM's Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the US Government.\nIn a statement to the New York Times regarding the letter GM took offense, responding, \"The letter sent by the plaintiffs to the U.S. attorney's office and leaked to the media is misleading.\"\nRegarding GM's comment Hilliard states:\n\"Given that, during the 10 years it actively concealed this defect, GM redefined the very meaning of the word 'misleading' this characterization by GM is just a bit hard to swallow and rings hollow.\n\"For more than 10 years GM misled and lied to its own customers and the families of those killed from this defect. It was also determined to overtly and directly mislead and lie to NHTSA.\n\"GM is accusing plaintiffs of being misleading because we laid out, directly and unequivocally, GM's ongoing violations of its duties under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement? An agreement GM voluntarily and eagerly signed so as to avoid potential severe criminal consequences to this deadly defect.\n\"I invite GM's leadership to sit in the living room of some of the families who lost loved ones to this ignition switch defect so as to begin to appreciate the consequence of actual misleading behavior.\"\nABOUT HMG http://www.hmglawfirm.com/\nHilliard Muñoz Gonzales LLP (HMG) specializes in mass torts, personal injury, product liability, commercial and business litigation, and wrongful death.
