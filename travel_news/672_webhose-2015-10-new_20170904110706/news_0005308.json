We are grateful the storm had no impact on the resort. The hotel is open and our dedicated associates are welcoming guests.\nIn advance of the hurricane we proactively closed and evacuated the resort and assisted guests with travel plans and relocation to Guadalajara. The safety and security of our guests and associates is always a top priority. As is the Marriott culture, we continue to work closely with our associates to gauge if they may need assistance as a result of the storm.\nSource:- Marriott", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:17:50.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
