The students are those with a mentally impaired illness such as Down Syndrome and Autism. \nThe organization is represented in China through many centers found throughout four cities in China ̶ Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. \nIt provides learning centers to those special-needs people and helps them to fit into the world through many activities such as developing their personal skills in painting, singing, and dancing. \nTheir centers also provide a place for those students to come and spend their time when their families are working during the day. \nMiss Seychelles...another world 2015 visited centers located in Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. \nThe students were introduced to Seychelles through different classes before the visit in order to prepare them in advance. They were asked to portray their imagination of what Seychelles looks like through many different paintings which were then shared with the delegates and given as gifts. \nMiss Freminot was being accompanied by the Principal Scretary for Tourism, Anne Lafortune; Seychelles Ambassador in China Vivianne Fock-Tave; the Seychelles Tourism Board’s Manager in China, Jean-Luc Lai-Lam; Senior Marketing Executive for China, Mr. Sam Yu; and Shen Yi, the Personal Assistant to the Ambassador. \nThe students presented the delegation with special art performances through dancing and singing activities. \nA workshop session for painting was a main piece at each location whereby the students and the delegation got the chance to work together. \n\"This was a great chance for us to raise awareness towards the less fortunate people that live in our society today. Though being special in many different ways, they have highly-developed skills in many different areas. This gave me the chance to see a different side to the world,” Miss Freminot said. \nMrs. Lafortune was also interviewed by ZTV5 in Hangzhou. \n\"It is important not to only promote the beauty of our islands, but together with Miss Seychelles promote the beauty of our people by being able to bring support and awareness to groups of people with special needs throughout our society where love transcends borders,\" Mrs. Lafortune said.
