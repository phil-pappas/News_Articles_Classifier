Whooping cranes are approximately 5 feet tall and fly with their neck outstretched. Adults are all white with the exception of black wing tips and reddish-black facial pattern.\nWhooping cranes were near extinction in the early to mid-20th century. Through conservation efforts, the birds' numbers have increased slowly to an estimated 308.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:27:29.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
