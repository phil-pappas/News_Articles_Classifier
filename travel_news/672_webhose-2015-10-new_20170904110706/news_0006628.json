Adelaide is framed by verdant parks and wide, sweeping streets filled with lively cafes and restaurants.\nLife in Adelaide is relaxed and easy. It’s a wonderfully walk able city, with most of the attractions only a short stroll away from each other.\nBeneath the city’s charm lies a groundbreaking community. Back in 1895, South Australian women became the first in the world to be allowed to stand for parliament. The University of Adelaide was the first in the country to admit women to study and South Australia was the first Australian state to introduce wide-ranging anti-discrimination laws.\nEach year in March, Adelaide’s multicultural atmosphere reaches a crescendo as the city’s parks, warehouses, theatres and galleries come alive during a month long fiesta of music, food, arts and culture.\nA consortium of ten festivals has been established under the umbrella Festivals Adelaide, which includes the Adelaide Festival, Adelaide Fringe Festival and the WOMA Delaide world music festival held in the city’s Botanic Park.\nAdd to that a host of major sporting events like the Clipsal 500 and the Santos Tour Down Under and you can begin to understand why people call Adelaide Australia’s ‘Festival State’.\nGourmands have plenty to choose from as Adelaide’s restaurants offer exceptional quality, service and value. Local produce features heavily on the menus, with world-class restaurants offering everything from exceptional Italian cuisine to cheep and cheerful Chinese.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:00:46.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
