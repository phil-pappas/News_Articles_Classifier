This is a capital city of big skies and bigger vistas; of rumbling trams and Willy Wonka–like elevators; of melancholic fado song and live-to-party nightlife. \nDiogo de Boitaca's creative vision and King Manuel I's gold-laden coffers gave rise to Mosteiro dos Jerónimos, a fantasy fairy tale of a monastery founded in 1501 to trumpet Vasco da Gama's discovery of a sea route to India. Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Jerónimos (mosteirojeronimos.pt) was once populated by monks of the Order of St Jerome, whose spiritual job for four centuries was to comfort sailors and pray for the king's soul. When the order was dissolved in 1833, the monastery was used as a school and orphanage until about 1940. \nThe Jeronimos Monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage site in Lisbon. Image: Calle Montes \nThere's a reason why Tram 28 tops most travellers' Lisbon wish-list. This rickety, screechy, gloriously old-fashioned ride from Praça Martim Moniz to Campo Ourique is 40 minutes of mood-lifting views and absurdly steep climbs. With its polished wood panelling, bee-yellow paint job and chrome fittings, this century-old tram is like the full-scale model of a fastidious Hornby collector. Use bom dias (good mornings) and the powers of persuasion to bag a space by the window and prepare for a self-guided city tour to remember. \nGazing grandly over the city, the heavily restored hilltop fortification Castelo de São (castelodesaojorge.pt) evokes Lisbon's history from the bold to the bloody. \nSettlers first arrived in the area in the 7th century BC, but the castle itself dates to the mid-11th century when the Moors ruled Lisbon and the stronghold was the heart of their alcáçova (citadel). Christian crusaders in 1147, royals from the 14th to 16th centuries, and convicts in every century; battles, coronations and an earthquake – this castle has seen it all. \nNo amount of hype about Europe's second-largest aquarium – where 8000 species splash in 7 million litres of seawater – could ever convey the eye-popping scale of Lisbon's Oceanário (oceanario.pt). Sand tiger sharks, stingrays, pufferfish and sunfish can be spotted in the mammoth central tank, and puffins, penguins and sea otters in geographically focused exhibitions spotlighting the marine life of the North Atlantic, Antarctic, Pacific and tropical Indian Ocean. Conservation is the name of the game, with realistic habitats and no circus hoopla. \nThere's no place like Praça do Comércio for the \"wow, I'm in Lisbon!\" effect. Everyone arriving by boat used to disembark here, and it still feels like the gateway to Lisbon, thronging with activity and trams. With its 18th-century arcades and triumphal arch, this is the city at its monumental best. Wander the riverfront, gaze up at the equestrian statue, and see the history of Lisbon mapped out in stone. This handsome plaza witnessed the worst of the 1755 earthquake and the fall of the monarchy in 1908, and lived to tell the tale. \nThe Museu Calouste Gulbenkian museu.gulbenkian.pt) showcases an epic collection of Western and Eastern art famous for its outstanding quality and breadth. \nYou can easily spend half a day taking a chronological tour of the treasures that wealthy Armenian art collector Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian (1869–1955) picked up on his world travels. Egyptian pharaoh reliefs, Persian carpets, Qing porcelain, 18th-century French silver, Dutch Master paintings, impressionist art and exquisite René Lalique jewellery – this is an exuberant feast of fine and decorative arts. Ad Feedback \nSoaring ethereally above Lisbon, the Convento do Carmo, founded as a convent for the Carmelite Order in 1389, was all but devoured by the 1755 earthquake. Its shattered pillars and wishbone-like arches are completely exposed to the elements. \nThe Gothic nave collapsed on worshippers when the earthquake struck on All Saints' Day in 1755. The 19th-century taste for romantic ruins meant it was never restored as planned, and it later became the captivating archaeology museum you see today. \nKeep an eye out for star pieces by Albrecht Dürer, Nuno Gonçalves and Gil Vicente in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (www.museudearteantiga.pt). On its scenic perch above the river, this 17th-century palace, once home to the Counts of Alvor, is a fittingly grand backdrop for Lisbon's foremost collection of ancient art. And what a collection it is! Meissen porcelain, Portuguese sculpture, Beauvais tapestry, Ming porcelain, baroque silverware and Japanese screens do a stellar job of whisking you through the world of fine and decorative arts from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. \nLonely Planet's Pocket Lisbon is available from October. \nNever heard of Museu Colecção Berardo (museuberardo.pt)? Bankrolled by Portugal's biggest art collector and billionaire José Berardo, this gallery can hold its own with the Tates and Guggenheims of this world. Yet, incredibly, it is still off the must-see sightseeing radar. Dadaism, minimalism, kinetic art, surrealism and conceptualism; works by Picasso, Dubuffet, Warhol, Yves Klein, Pollock, Miró and Lichtenstein – this mind-blowing collection spans the entire spectrum of modern and contemporary art, from 1960 to 2010. \nWhen Queen Dona Leonor founded the Convento do Madre de Deus in 1509, she surely had no idea that the Manueline convent would one day become Museu Nacional do Azulejo, a stunning tribute to the azulejo (hand-painted tile). Well worth a detour, this exceptional museum unravels 500 years of Portuguese history and craftsmanship. A day on the tiles here takes you through chapels with evocative religious panels, corridors emblazoned with Renaissance hunting scenes and rooms dancing with geometric detail. \nPalácio Nacional de Sintra is the icing on Sintra's UNESCO World Heritage cake. This sugar-white palace, crowned by a pair of huge conical chimneys, is pure fantasy stuff. Of Moorish origins, the palace was expanded by Dom Dinis (1261–1325), then enlarged by João I in the 15th century and given a Manueline makeover by Manuel I in the following century. Take in arabesque courtyards, barley-twist columns, and 15th- and 16th-century geometric azulejos – among Portugal's oldest – as you wander. \nWHEN TO GO \nWinter (Nov– Feb): Quiet except for Carnival in February.

Bus connections to the centre run frequently. The quickest way to reach the centre is by taking the metro or the AeroBus (yellowbustours.com). Buses depart in front of the arrivals hall. \nGETTING AROUND Lisbon's public transport network is cheap and efficient. Save time and money with multiple trips by buying a 24-hour pass (€6), covering buses, trams, funiculars and the metro. For timetables, routes and fares, see carris.pt and metrolisboa.pt. Much of Bairro Alto, Baixa and Alfama are pedestrian-only – walking is the way to go. \nMORE INFORMATION Visit Lisboa, see visitlisboa.com \nThis is an edited extract from Lonely Planet Pocket Lisbon (3rd Edition) by Kerry Christiani, © Lonely Planet 2015.
