Too many people are neglecting the appropriate care of these glasses, leaving them dull or even damaged. To help you avoid such problems, we have outlined some recommended care and leaning instructions. \n▪ Crystal and hand painted hospitality glassware is not dishwasher safe. A dishwasher, whilst convenient, will cause significant loss of luster and brilliance to both types of glass. In the case of paint, it will also damage the designs and fade any gold accents. \n▪ Instead, we recommend washing this bar glassware in warm water with a non-abrasive cleaning solution. Many people also like to cushion the bottom of the sink with a towel or rubber mat just in case a glass slips and falls from your hand whilst washing it. \n▪ Hard water spots are troublesome for all bar glassware, not just crystal and hand painted ones. The best way to prevent this is by hand drying immediately with a soft, lint free cloth. If spots do appear, try gently rubbing them with half a lemon and washing in vinegar. \n▪ Store and/or display crystal glasses away from direct sunlight and other direct heat sources. You should also avoid letting them come into contact with hard and abrasive surfaces or materials. Most areas can be lined or covered with protective felt to avoid this. \n▪ When packing hospitality glassware for short-term storage, it's important that you use a soft cloth, bubble wrap or similar material. Avoid letting it come into direct contact with newspaper or other moisture-absorbing materials for long periods of time. \n▪ You should avoid exposing your hand painted and crystal glasses to rapid changes or extremes in temperature. This means, for example, that they shouldn't be stored in the freezer or washed in hot water and then plunged into cold water for a rinse. \n▪ Never use hospitality glassware in the microwave, oven or on the stovetop. As we've already mentioned, it also shouldn't be placed in the freezer and we believe you should also avoid placing it in a fridge. This all links back to temperature extremes. \nWe hope that the care and cleaning instructions provided above have given you a good idea of how to properly care for your crystal and hand painted bar glassware. It is important that every person working in your business have been appropriately instructed on the dos and don'ts so that they don't inadvertently damage your glasses beyond repair.
