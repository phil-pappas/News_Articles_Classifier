Photo Credit: Cecilia Pang. \n\nThe Grave-Sweeping Festival falls on the 9th day of the 9th month on the Lunar Calendar. It is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture. \nThe Grave-Sweeping Festival dates back to the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD). \nAccording to legend, a fortune-teller advised a man to take his family into the hills on the 9th day of the 9th month. When they returned to their village the following day, they discovered that everyone there had been slaughtered. \nFor this reason, it is customary for Chinese people to hike into the hills on this day. \nThey also visit grave sites - which are often located on hillsides - to have picnics, set off firecrackers, and burn paper offerings to their forebears, a practice that is sometimes referred to as ‘ancestor worship’. \nHundreds of fires break out in the New Territories during the Grave Sweeping Festival each year. \nTalking Points \nHave you ever witnessed the Grave Sweeping Festival?
