You can search for hours, turning over your house and retracing your footsteps. But if the key doesn't show up, it's deeply frustrating, not to say highly inconvenient. Fortunately, the AA has a service to help. The motoring organisation says its Key Assist technicians will come to you at home, at work or at the roadside. So wherever you're located, you can get back in your car and on the road in no time at all. Key Assist isn't only for people who have mislaid their keys. The AA's team can also help if you simply want to order a spare for your vehicle. The Key Assist service uses the latest technology to cater for all types of cars. The AA supplies new keys for a fraction of the charge of motor dealers That means the AA can supply replacement keys for most vehicles, whether they are conventional transponder keys, radio-frequency remote control keys, or offer state-of-the-art hands-free access to your car. Even better, the organisation says it supplies new keys for a fraction of the charge levied by motor dealers. This is because it doesn't replace every component in a car's ignition and locking mechanism, which can include the key, an ignition-mounted aerial and an immobiliser control. Instead, it programmes a replacement key to work with your existing set-up, thereby saving hundreds of pounds. Every Key Assist technician is fully trained to use specialist key-programming technology. Theyâ€™re also CRB-checked, bringing valuable piece of mind to motorists who may be stranded alone or feeling vulnerable. A helping hand: the AA Key Assist service can replace lost keys or provice spares Photo: Getty Thanks to their nationwide presence, a Key Assist specialist can be with you in no time at all. This, of course, is a hallmark of the AA's patrols, which last year covered some 13 million miles while recovering members across the UK and Ireland. As it happens, the organisation has more patrol units than all of the other breakdown companies put together. That means you're never far away from help, whatever the problem. Key Assist is just one example of the specialist support the AA offers to motorists throughout the country. And while the service doesn't save you the annoyance of a lost car key, it does at least mitigate its impact.
