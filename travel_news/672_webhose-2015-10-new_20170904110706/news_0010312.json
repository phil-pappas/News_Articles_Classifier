China, 10 October 2015 -- The invention of self-balancing electric scooter brings a brand new idea in the transportation field. Generally speaking, the scooter is driven by electric motor and achieves dynamic stabilization with gyroscope and circuit control principle. The rider can accelerate or decelerate by leaning forward or backward.Gyroscope is an indispensable part of Fosjoas self-balancing electric scooter V2. It keeps motion in a unique way and is applied in many fields. For example, the compass and the autopilot of one airplane have over ten. Russian Mir Space Station once used 11 gyroscopes to keep its direction to the Sun. Meanwhile, gyroscope is widely used in such toys as Yo-yo and Frisbee. Specifically speaking, the principle of gyroscope is based on “Processional Motion”. If a gyroscope is spinning and one twirls the spinning axis, the gyroscope will spin around the axis which is in perpendicular with the external force. If two gyroscopes are installed in one system and their axes are in perpendicular with each other, whatever the motion is, the system will keep dynamic stabilization. This is the operation principle of Fosjoas self-balancing electric scooter V2. Therefore, gyroscope plays a pivotal role in the operation of the electric scooter as its soul. Fosjoas electric scooter V2 uses the gyroscope of the state-of-the-art technique and can operate freely even in extremely bad conditions to guarantee the rider’s safety. Because of this technique, Fosjoas intelligent scooter is quite easy to learn. It only takes 5 to 7 minutes for a green hand to master the riding skills and can travel freely and comfortably on the streets or in the park. Also, with its small and flexible figure, Fosjoas V2 can get rid of the traffic congestion easily and saves much time for the rider. In addition, it does not consume much energy so riders can travel a long way to the places they’d like to go and then saunter on the beach or in the garden. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:36:48.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
