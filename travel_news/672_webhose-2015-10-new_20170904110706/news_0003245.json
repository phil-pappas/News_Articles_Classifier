Their parents singing (CNN) Whether you're strapping lawn chairs between the seats to keep the kids from maiming each other or secretly fantasizing about that bottle of Chardonnay you're going to reward yourself with for enduring yet another round of \"The Lego Movie\" during the drive, road trips with the kids can be painful.\nBut guess what? In their eyes, you're no rainbow-pooping unicorn either.\nCar maker Ford surveyed 2,002 children aged 7-12 in Europe, asking what annoys them most about car journeys and how their parents handle stress.\nCountries included in the survey were France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK.\nWhat's their number one gripe?\nRead More Having to endure their parents' singing.\nThey also complained about badly behaved moms and dads who shout at other drivers, swear and pick their noses.\n\"I was just scratching it!\"\nThe Ford survey, conducted earlier this year, was aimed at better understanding what children like and don't like about traveling in cars, says the company.\nSinging parents were found to be least popular in the UK, where 39% of children ranked this their biggest pet hate.\nChildren in France -- the only country that didn't rank singing as the worst habit -- were twice as likely to complain about their parents shouting at other drivers.\nIn fact, it would appear quite a few parents should introduce their mouths to a bar of soap.\nAcross Europe, 61% of children revealed parents got angry or used \"naughty words,\" with French parents being the worst offenders (74%).\nOf all the kids questioned, those in the UK were most likely to choose nose-picking as the worst parental habit, followed by Italy and Germany.\nAs for getting kids to behave, snacks, TV shows, smartphones and movies were the most common bribes, said surveyed children.\nSo what question are you most likely to get asked by a child during a boring car journey?\nAccording to the survey, it's: \"Are we there yet?\"\nNice to know some things never change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:39:36.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
