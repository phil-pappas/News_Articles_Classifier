My spine would not like that. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nHeh! Definitely not a requirement, they have some other trails that go through different areas of the mountain range. And they even have lakeside tables where you can view the whole range with a cocktail in hand. :) http://everything-everywhere.com Gary Arndt \nI still haven’t been to Nepal (or anything in South Asia for that matter) :( http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThat’s just unacceptable. Get thee to Nepal! :) Kara Freedman \nI’ve heard the same advice – in fact I had a friend who was in Nepal at the time of the earthquake and his number one recommendation was to go visit in order to support the tourism industry. Your lovely pictures are only an added bonus to the amazing things I’ve already heard about visiting Nepal! http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you Kara! I am glad that I might have helped tip you over the edge into visiting. It really is one of the most gorgeous places I’ve ever visited, so many beautiful mountain ranges and forests. Also, there is a really interesting fusion of Tibetan culture throughout as Nepal is one of the places a lot of them have found refuge. It’s makes it sort of like a double cultural trip! :) Tom Powers \nGreat to see your blog again!!! Thanks for whetting my appetite for Nepal. It has been on the list prior to and after the quake. Soon enough!! http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThanks Tom! It feels good to write again. And I do hope you’re able to bump Nepal up on the list! Keep me posted if you head there and need some help on great organizations to use on the ground. :) Bekki Young \nThank you for this post, I fly to Nepal in September and have faced a lot of scepticism from people due to the country essentially being in recovery, I have been trying to explain these exact points not only to reassure family but also to justify my reasoning, I can’t wait to meet these strong and wonderfully diverse people and the country they love! http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nI am so glad to hear that you are heading there in the fall! People will be skeptical because they don’t really understand the scope of recovery needed, and the places affected. By all accounts, Pokhara is fully back up and running, it’s really the Kathmandu Valley that was devastated, so tourism dollars coming in can help them have the money to keep rebuilding. I hope you have a wonderful trip. Veena \nYes, yes, a thousand times yes. I too love Nepal and want to see it recover as quickly as possible. I understand tourists staying away in that initial month so as to not interfere with rescue efforts, but I cannot agree more that it is the tourism industry that will have the longest-lasting impact on Nepal’s recovery. A beautiful story, and a great reminder that however close or far away two places may be, they still have an undeniable link connecting them: humanity. Thank you so much for this, Shannon! xx http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you Veena! Nepal has so much to offer in terms of culture and natural beauty that I really hope that people start to look at it in a new light and visit to see it first-hand. :) Neils Pembridge \nFor a country that is so dependent on tourism the back to back earthquakes are literally devastating. Nepal is truly wonderful in terms of natural beauty and if you are a mountaineer you have to go visit Nepal. May they soon recover and rebuild their lives. BTW very nicely written article and amazing images. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you Neils, I agree on all accounts. They made tourism the backbone of their nation’s income, so these earthquakes were devastating on so many levels. Molla Jafar Sadique \nI just have got my passport yesterday, and I am starting thinking to fly to Nepal first :) Hiking will be the another reason to fly to nepal as a first trip in abroad :) http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nCongrats on getting your passport and I hope you make it to Nepal soon! Tiptoes World \nThanks for sharing this Shannon. So very motivating! My heart goes out to those suffering. As you said, the travel is about meeting people and the natives and just getting to know how they live. Nepal is definitely on top of my list. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nGlad to hear that! It’s a beautiful country with a lot of culture — if you plan a trip there you won’t regret it. :) http://housetolaos.com/ House To Laos \nBeautiful story Shannon – we hope to make it over to Nepal on our next trip to Asia, hopefully soon! http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you! Like you, I am now looking for ways to add Nepal into my next trip over that way. I hope you make it there soon! http://www.experiencebermuda.com/ William McGregor \nThanks for such a beautiful post Shannon, it really feels bad for people who suffered such devastating back to back earthquakes in Nepal, it is our responsibility to help them out. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you William, I do believe if we all do a small part we can help Nepal rebuild. I appreciate you reading along! Martha \nI read your Volunteer Traveler’s Handbook last year and came across an organization, All Hands Volunteers, that is now working in Nepal. I am heading to Kathmandu next week to join AHV with the rebuild efforts and I wouldn’t be going there if it weren’t for you. Many thanks! http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you so much for sharing that, you made my day to know that from the book to the company now and heading to Nepal, that some of the information was able to help. I hope the trip goes well and that through AHV you are able to help make an impact. Martha \nI just returned from Nepal after volunteering with All Hands for 5 weeks. It was an incredible experience in so many ways and it was very difficult to leave Kathmandu, especially as a United Nations plane was unloading on the tarmac as I departed. I was so affected by my time there that I am returning in October to first volunteer and then travel through this magnificent country that so easily stole my heart. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nFive weeks, wow. Thank you for checking back in and letting me know how your trip went. I can’t imagine how it felt to leave when there is so much more work to be done. October will come soon and I hope you are able to both help, and to see so much of the beautiful country — they need both things right now. Keep me posted if there is anything I can do to help as you plan and return. Barsoon \nFantastic Article Shannon. I went to Nepal in 2011 and ever since I’ve wanted to go back. Seeing the devastating news was heartbreaking especially when I saw it not just from the angle of the media but through Nepalese friends on FB. One thing I know for certain is the Nepalese people are very resilient even with government corruption being rife. I’ve put it on the top of my priority to get back there ASAP! http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nI think it’s so important for those of us who already care about Nepal to share our expereinces and even go back to support the people if we can. I hope you are able to make it back there soon! Barsoon \nAbsolutely, couldn’t agree more! Yes I’m working hard to get there soon:) Anil Gurung \nThank you very much for this post, Shannon! \nWe need this, every post like yours goes a long way in supporting the recovery of the tourism industry on which many Nepali livelihoods depend. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you for reading Anil! It’s a long road for Nepal and I hope the word is spread widely that the country is reopen for tourism. Cabo \nBeautiful Photos. I was in Nepal in 2002 and also had the most amazing experiences. It is definitely a place I want to head back to soon, this time with my family. http://www.wildernessmetropolis.com/ Elen \nGreat article. I am heading to Nepal in October on a press trip, and the intention is to publish work afterwards on how tourism is in the country after the quakes, as well as encourage tourists to keep going. I think writing like this, and your blog here, can really help with those efforts. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nIt’s so important now to emphasize tourism as a strong way that people can help Nepal recover. I hope you have a wonderful trip and are able to see a lot, as well as spread some tourism dollars around. :) http://www.joeniemczura.wordpress.com Joe Niemczura \nI want, desperately, to believe that this is true. The Nepal of 2009 is not the Nepal of right now (Sept 11 2015) first, read the piece by Donatella Lorch http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/09/10/439195188/i-am-in-nepal-now-says-new-tourist-campaign-only-nepal-is-in-chaos Then you can read my own two cents. I’m sure many of your readers, who have been around, will be aware that just because conflict exists does not mean it exists everywhere. But – Nepal is not an easy “first Asian country.” http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nInteresting to see that article, I hadn’t read it yet. I wil link to it in the piece. It’s hard to know though, not being on the ground, what the situation is like. Some of what she points out is/was a part of Nepal before the earthquake too, and yet tourism was still able to function around it. The Nepal of 2009 wasn’t all roses. In two months I never had more than 8 hours of power a day, the Moaists protested and shut down the route from Pokhara to Kathmandu for several days. These are a part of visiting a less developed and area with political issues. Burma has had massive border issues for years, but is successfully managing tourism in other areas. A direct comparison isn’t possible as Burma is not recovering from a devestating earthquake, but more to say that issues alone are not an indicator you shouldn’t visit. And there remain very, very real problems in Burma’s treatment of the hilltribes, but this more to say that they still have built and maintained tourism. The things about Nepal’s trading issues and shortages — those are very real concerns, especially as winter nears. I don’t know the answer, but I do know that businesses are begging for tourists, they are emailing me, they are communicating with the tourism board, they are looking for ways to rebuild at least some income. These remote areas in need — who knows how much, if any, will get to relieve the situation anytime soon. It’s an issue, but not necessarily a reason not to look to Nepal and see if there are pieces of a trip you could safely take and positively impact the country without pulling resources from those still in need. I know people on the ground now are saying it’s certianly not ideal, and it’s not the trip people would have gotten last year at this time, but it’s hard to assess the impact and dismiss that there is good that tourism can do at the ground level of infusing funds when there is enough infrasturture to support it. I’ll admit, and I do in the piece too, that I am not there now. But I have a hard time believing that maintaining a complete lack of tourism for the foreseeable future won’t also have a compounding negative impact. http://www.joeniemczura.wordpress.com Joe Niemczura \nIt depends a lot on the travel style of the person contemplating the trip, and frankly, on their budget. In July, I wrote a longer take on this exact issue. https://joeniemczura.wordpress.com/2015/07/19/my-advice-to-those-seeking-to-bring-back-the-tourists-to-nepal-july-19th-2015/ http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nI’d agree with that, and reading that piece makes me think that you’re not a regular blog reader here on a little adrift. My readership is very heavily weighted toward long-term travelers who are experienced in the developing world. Though there are new travelers who find their way to my articles, the style of travel I advocate usually resonates with people who are DIY travel planners on a longish break (a month or more) and many are also women who have bucked the trend and continue to backpack India. I wouldn’t earmark Nepal now, or at any point in the near future, as a place for an indie, solo, first-time trip out of the states. I agree with you there. :) http://www.joeniemczura.wordpress.com Joe Niemczura \nMy secrets revealed! No, I haven’t been a regular reader, though I’ll try it out. I pretty much stick with Nepal. Keep up the good work! http://www.EdgesOfEarth.com Brock \nAhhh, your photos are article makes me want to jump right in to Nepal, so I can see the sights, breathe the air, eat their local food, climb their mountains, and soak up their culture like a sponge! I have seen hundreds of videos from backpackers and such, about Nepal. Looks like an awesome cultural experience. #BucketList lol Thanks for sharing :) http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you Brock! Like you, I have wonderful memories and I’d love to go back in the next year or so and support the Nepalis as they recover. Thanks for reading and enjoying. :) http://www.migrationexpert.com.au/ Rachel \nI do think there’s no better way to help Nepal but to bring back it tourism popularity.. and as always, your photos are so incredible! ♥ http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nThank you Rachel! The country has a long road to recovery but I really do think torii am will play a big part.
