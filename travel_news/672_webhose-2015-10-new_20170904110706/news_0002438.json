The infectiously cheerful Bennett—hardly one to simply blend in—began to experiment with new designs that would first and foremost meet the demanding needs of professional chefs (think raw Japanese selvage denim, brass hardware, reinforced pockets) but also have some personality. Hedley & Bennett was born and big-name chefs around the country—Mario Batali, David Chang, Nobu Matsuhisa, and many more—became quick converts to her cool American-made styles.\nNow she’s upping the ante with a new collaboration with Gray Malin —the artist known for his cheery aerial photographs of beach scenes around the world. The 100 limited-edition aprons, launching today, are printed with the Barcelona Nude Beach photo from his “À la Plage” series. “Everything about this apron was designed in the exact same way as all of our other aprons,” Bennett explains. “It’s not just meant to be pretty, it’s meant to be worn and washed and spilled on. . . It’s designed for professionals, but with an extra bit of fun jammed in there, too.” She adds, “I’m a gigantic fan of a colorful life, so when I discovered Gray Malin, I immediately loved him.”\nShot from a helicopter, one must look closely in order to see the bare bodies sprawled out on the sand in this print—but make no mistake, there are a few bare bums on view. “I couldn’t be happier with the wearable piece of art that we cocreated,” says Malin. “I love thinking about all of the cheeky conversations it’ll ignite.”\nGray Malin x Hedley & Bennett Nude Beach Apron, $120; graymalin.com or hedleyandbennett.com", "external_links": ["http://www.hedleyandbennett.com/", "https://www.graymalin.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:00:48.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
