Key markets are MNCs and financial institutions, Loh said, although he revealed that the sales team is also approaching various embassies and governments. \n\nWhile largely targeted at business travellers as well as corporate employees on longer-term overseas assignments, he added that Klapsons would also appeal to “a smaller percentage of tourists coming for leisure”. \n\nRead more reports from the ground in our IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific 2015 Show Dailies .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:47:01.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
