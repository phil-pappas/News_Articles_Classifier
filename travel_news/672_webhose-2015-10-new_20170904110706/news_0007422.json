In a world where flat beds (typically with direct aisle access) are effectively expected in Business Class, its becoming far harder to make a profitable and competitive First product.\nYou need a private suite or something along those lines to be competitive, for one. You also need ground service that's really good, and I think this is by far the most critical factor economically since it requires a substantial investment in a geographically-fixed product.\nThis spatial issue is the big one. It means the \"proper\" First Class experience for an airline can only really be delivered when departing from the airline's hub . Unless there's some way to make a First Class lounge also accessible for arrivals to the hub (is this even possible?), then the \"full\" First Class experience is basically reserved for those leaving from the hub (there are few exceptions but basically very few airlines operate dedicated First lounges at outstations).\nLufthansa First Class is far less fun when you aren't leaving from Frankfurt (that said, LH's First Class Terminal may be helpful for making arrivals into Frankfurt consistently good too). QF First Class is more fun departing from SYD or MEL than departing from LAX (the alliance with Emirates greatly helps though, since they can use the DXB First lounge). Etcetera.\nThis leads me to the following conclusions:\n1. Airlines which offer single-hub operations (typically ones based in small nations) are better positioned to offer First Class than multi-hub airlines based in large nations. They don't need to invest as much to create a consistent-quality First Class experience.\n2. Consistent-quality First is generally something which requires hub-to-hub routes. If Boeing are right, that the days of megahubs are very much in the further future, that works against the proliferation of First class.\n3. A geographic concentration of wealthy passengers is best for First.\n4. As the value of comfort rises on long-haul flights, an airline that operates long-haul routes is going to have more First demand, primarily on those routes.\nNow let's look at SQ. SQ satisfies all of the above conditions - there are lots of wealthy people in Singapore's small area. Singapore Airlines flies plenty of hub-to-hub routes (to allied airline's hubs which have First Class ground services available). SQ runs a single-hub operation (Changi) and therefore doesn't need to operate duplicated ground services at multiple places. SQ runs some of the longest-haul flights in the world. Every factor for SQ is in favor of a First Class product being offered.\nYet even SQ is saying that the First Class market is not growing (even though passenger numbers are).\nThis is why First Class is often described as \"dying\". Many airlines are getting rid of it and switching to a \"really good business class/premium economy that's really like a diet business class/economy class\" model (this is particularly true for big nations with geographically-distributed wealth, such as the US). Even Emirates only really offer their flagship First experience ex-DXB (since a lot of the fun is the lounge), although ex-SYD works too since you can use the QF First lounge.\nFirst is a niche, and if even SQ are realizing that a proper and competitive First will never be a massive market segment, I think that says a lot.\nI think Qantas will keep First from Syd/Mel but I don't expect them to ever expand the offering (if they do, they'll probably only do that from Perth and only if they decide to start direct flights to Europe... ULH routes). Perhaps if they ever did a Sydney/New York direct flight (should be possible with a 777X-8 in a less-dense, premium-heavy configuration) we would see First on that too.\nSorry, I just needed to get those thoughts out. But yeah, I'm not sure Akbar Al Baker (who argues First Class is obsolete) is entirely right... but First Class surely isn't going to grow for a very long time.\n2 report reply 1 3 hours, 33 minutes ago by Tom How ong did it take you to write that? :)\nOn a more serious note though I totally agree with you, but the only real thing that would make people to fly First is a 1-1-1 config like QF has on their 380's. Take for example EK 1-2-1 config in both J and F, not that much difference between the two except for better meals, amenities lounges etc. This is the case with many airlines too.\n0 report reply 1 2 hours, 41 minutes ago by StudiodeKadent \"How long did it take you to write that? :)\"\nNot as long as you might think. I had the ideas in my head for a while and just needed to put them down on virtual paper. So they flowed rather quickly. The thoughts were pre-systematized.\n\"On a more serious note though I totally agree with you, but the only real thing that would make people to fly First is a 1-1-1 config like QF has on their 380's.

I've flown Emirates First and Business, and the First is much better. Even the seats are about 5 inches wider in the A380, plus there's the closing door, and the footwell isn't restrictive like EK business (seriously, I can't sleep on EK business. I spend EK business flights partying in the bar, which isn't really a bad thing!). The better food, booze, and even service really help. And the lounge in Dubai has a la carte meals. So yeah, there is a substantial difference. (This isn't meant to come across as saying EK business is bad. It isn't. Its great! Its one of the most \"fun\" ways to fly... like Virgin Atlantic Upper Class).\nQF First's 1-1-1 config doesn't come with exceptionally wide seats just to make it clear. Sure, great product, but its only wider than the Business Suite when in bed mode.\n0 report reply 3 1 hour, 10 minutes ago by Serg \"I would say that you would still need to maintain first class if you want to call yourself a ‘full service’ carrier, but even Qantas has only left it on their Airbus A380s.\"\nLOL!
