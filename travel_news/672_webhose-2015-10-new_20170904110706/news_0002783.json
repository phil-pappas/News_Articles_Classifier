Happy brewing! Fresh beans The choice of bean is personal but freshness is paramount. You ideally want to use them within a month of roasting while those secondary flavours and aromas are at their freshest. When buying beans off the supermarket shelf it is not always possible to determine the roasting date whereas if you buy from an artisan micro-roaster you can. There are more than 300 micro-roasters in Britain today so you should not have to travel far to find one. Provided they are competent and experienced you will benefit from their expertise and get the freshest beans. Alternatively, look online. Artisan roasters such as Eightpointnine will deliver beans to your door by post within days of roasting. An even grind Grinding is an art in itself. You do not want to pulverise the beans so much as grind them to a consistent size to ensure an even extraction of flavour once water is added. To that end, avoid simple blade grinders, which chop and dice, in favour of burr mills, which grind the beans between two revolving, abrasive surfaces. These also have the advantage of generating less heat, keeping flavours and aromas intact. The finer grounds required for espresso making are best achieved with an electric burr mill Bean dilema: there are more than 300 micro-roasters in Britain Photo: Photolibrary Fresh filtered water Further attention to detail is required when it comes to brewing your freshly ground coffee. Water is the solvent that extracts the flavour compounds from the bean, so its quality is important. If you live in a hard-water area, you will not get the best from the bean nor the smoothest cup, unless you filter your water first. Water temperature Boiling water scorches coffee and impairs the flavour. Water that is not hot enough will not properly extract the flavours. SCAE gives the ideal temperature as between 92C and 96C. Blooming the grounds It is important to bloom or pre-infuse the coffee. This is achieved by adding the minimum amount of water required to saturate the grounds. It allows gasses such as CO2 to escape and makes for a more even brewing process. Brew time The optimum brewing time for an espresso varies a little with the roast and the quality of the coffee bean, but as a rule of thumb a double espresso should take between 22-26 seconds. Any quicker and you will deprive yourself of the full taste and aroma. Any longer and you risk extracting too many bitter flavours. Dosing Adding more or less coffee to the brew is a quick way to change the flavour and aroma intensity of your coffee. The nominal amount of ground coffee for one espresso is 7 grammes. This is a personal preference, and varies with the quality of coffee. Whilst for two shots of coffee the amount is generally less than double to maintain the right flavour balance. Do not be put off by these specific weights and measures. Making the perfect cup very quickly becomes second nature. Just make sure you take at least three minutes to relax and enjoy every cup.
