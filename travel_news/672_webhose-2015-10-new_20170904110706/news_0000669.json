In the latest poll by ZUJI, the region’s leading online travel agent (OTA), 88% women were found to do their vacation research through travel sites or blogs, like ZUJI Passport, as compared to less than half of men (42%). In contrast, men (52%) seem more comfortable gathering insights from family and friends compared to women (7%). \n“Looking at our travel blog, ZUJI Passport, we see twice as many women than men on our site. This is definitely consistent with the findings from our latest ZUJI-dex,” said Chua Hui Wan, Chief Executive Officer, ZUJI Singapore. “Considering the current digital era, it is interesting to see how men still prefer the old-fashioned and personal approach to gathering travel recommendations from family and friends instead of relying on online content.” \nResponding to a series of travel habits and preferences, a total of 485 Singapore-based travellers participated in the poll. The following insights were discovered through the ZUJI-dex: When prepping for a vacation: \no Men (16%) are more likely to snag a travel deal when they see it as compared to women (12%). \no Both prefer to wait for the best travel and credit card deals promotions (Men: 40%, Women: 43%) – ZUJI bank partners also see more than a two-fold increase in credit card swipes during exclusive travel promotions. \no Men prefer dynamic planning (Men: 73%, Women: 70%), while women take preference in planning an itinerary (Men: 27%, Women 29%). \no 88% of women either Google travel tips by bloggers or check-out travel sites, like ZUJI and TripAdvisor, while only 42% of men do so. (To support this, 63% of page views on ZUJI Passport are by women, while the rest are men). \no Men (52%) on the other hand, prefer gathering insights from family and friends compared to women (7%). On vacation must-dos and haves: \no Men and women unite over their love for food and culture – making it top of their to-do lists when travelling. \no But men still prefer a vacation with a photographic view (40%), while women are out on a bargain hunt (48%). \no When travelling on a long haul flight, close to half of men (45%) must have a drink to unwind and calm the nerves, while a third of women (33%) turn to eye masks and ear plugs for a good sleep. When it comes to dollars and cents: \no Men (43%) would rather splurge to fill their bellies with the best local cuisine. \no Women (34%) prefer a little more glamour and would rather splurge on luxurious accommodation and shopping! (Top shopping destinations on ZUJI include Bangkok, Guangzhou and London). \no On a budget, more than half of both men (55%) and women (63%) are willing to forgo Wi-Fi access for a comfortable bed at night, despite living in a connected world. \no Over a third of men and more than a quarter of women would rather share bathroom and sleeping facilities than forgo air-conditioning! On embarrassing travel episodes \no Close to 10% of women have lost their bathing suits in the sea! \no Men seem to be a little more scatter-brained, with 20% of them arriving at the wrong airport gate, as compared to 16% of women. \no Men also seem more star-struck, with a quarter of them (25%) mistaking a stranger for a celebrity while overseas, compared to women (17%). Men tend to wanderlust more than women \no More men (15%) would like to travel 8 or more times a year than women (9%). \nThe next ZUJI-dex report will be announced in 2016. \nFrom now till 1 Nov 2015, MasterCard cardholders will enjoy up to $100 off flights and packages, 12% hotel coupon code and free travel insurance.
