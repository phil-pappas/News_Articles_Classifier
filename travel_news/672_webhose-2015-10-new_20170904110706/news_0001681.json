Responding to our customers’ needs we are offering additional flights at convenient times on Saturday and Sunday to accommodate the increase in French rugby fans wishing to travel to Bristol and onto Cardiff. This in turn allows us also to offer great value to our customers in the West Country and Wales to fly to Paris for a mini-break on short notice.\n“This increase in in-bound visitors is a huge boost to the local economy and we’re delighted that travellers to Wales are able to reach the rugby so easily using Bristol Airport, with a short onward journey to the Welsh capital.”\nAll passengers travelling with bmi regional always benefit from a full service product onboard modern and comfortable jet aircraft.\nThe additional flights include:\nSaturday 17 October: Flight number From To Dep.
