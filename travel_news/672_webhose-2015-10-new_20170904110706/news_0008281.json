The report has been denied by the authorities. \nChina published guidelines on state-owned enterprise reforms in mid-September, aiming at building more robust and healthy business controlled by the government by 2020. \nThe Chinese government plans to introduce private investors to state-owned companies categorized as \"for-profit entities\" and to encourage these companies to go public. \nAnalysts expect to see consolidation of state-owned companies in five areas — nuclear power, aviation, shipping, defense and railways — under the new round of reforms. \nAccording to Shenwan Hongyuan Securities, 43 Chinese state-owned companies made it on to the list of the world's top 500 companies last year, mainly in the defense and petrochemical sectors. \nThe Chinese government is likely to push for consolidation in the aerospace, aviation and transportation sectors, given the country's less significant presence in these industries, the brokerage said. \nLi Jin, head of research at the China Enterprise Research Institute, said that a top-down approach will be required in pushing through the state-owned enterprise reforms, since companies might not be willing to let go their profitable businesses.
