(NYSE, OSE: RCL) today reported better than anticipated third quarter results and raised adjusted earnings guidance to approximately $4.80 per share, mostly driven by strong momentum in the Caribbean .\nThe company also announced a $500 million share repurchase program, and a non-cash write down of $399.3 million associated with the Pullmantur brand.\nLooking ahead to 2016, the current order book is better than same time last year for both volume and price.\nKEY HIGHLIGHTS\nThird Quarter 2015 results:\nNet Yields were up 5.1% on a Constant-Currency basis (up 0.2% As-Reported). Net Cruise Costs (\"NCC\") excluding fuel were down 1.8% on a Constant-Currency basis (down 4.4% As-Reported). Adjusted Net Income was $628.1 million , or $2.84 per share, versus $492.9 million , or $2.20 per share, in 2014. This excludes the non-cash impairment charge described below. The company recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $399.3 million in the third quarter. These charges relate to Pullmantur's goodwill, the brand's trademark and trade names, and a reduction in the value of select vessels in the Pullmantur fleet. US GAAP Net Income was $228.8 million or $1.03 per share, which includes the impairment charges. US GAAP Net Income in 2014 was $490.2 million , or $2.19 per share. Full Year 2015 forecast:\nNet Yields are expected to increase approximately 3.5% on a Constant-Currency basis (down approximately 1.0% As-Reported). NCC excluding fuel are expected to be flat to down 1% on a Constant-Currency basis (down 3.5% to 2.5% As-Reported). Adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $4.80 per share. \"Our business trajectory keeps us solidly on the path to the Double-Double ,\" said Richard D. Fain , chairman and chief executive officer. \"Even though we are disappointed to have such a large non-cash charge related to Pullmantur, we are enthusiastic about the overall strength of our brands and our ability to continue our dramatic profitability growth.\"\nSHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM\nThe company also announced today that it expects to implement an orderly program to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. The company plans to begin with an accelerated share repurchase transaction of $200 million that should be completed by the end of January 2016 . Future transactions could include open market purchases or additional accelerated share repurchases. The company expects to complete the program by year-end 2016.\n\"This share repurchase program, in combination with another year of over 40% earnings growth, and the recent 25% increase in the dividend, exemplify our ongoing commitment to improving shareholder returns, one of our core financial objectives,\" said Jason T. Liberty , chief financial officer.\nPULLMANTUR IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\nThe Company conducts an analysis of the carrying value of its assets on a regular basis. In past quarters, management has acknowledged the weakness in the economies of Latin America , and the impact of this weakness on Pullmantur. Unfortunately, the economic outlook in Latin America has deteriorated further in recent months and, as a result, the brand is re-focusing on its core market of Spain . These factors triggered the company to record a non-cash impairment charge of $399.3 million , primarily related to its goodwill, its trademark and trade names and a reduction in the carrying value of select vessels in the Pullmantur fleet. This eliminates all intangibles at Pullmantur.\nAs the company right-sizes the brand, restructuring and related charges of approximately $5 to $10 million associated with the new strategy will be booked in future quarters. In addition, as previously anticipated, we will be eliminating the two-month reporting lag for the Pullmantur brand. This will start in the first quarter of 2016, and is expected to be immaterial to the company's results.\nAll the adjustments will be excluded from our key metrics for transparency and comparability purposes.\n\"The right-sizing of the Pullmantur fleet will better balance supply with demand for the brand in the Spanish market,\" said Richard D. Fain , chairman and chief executive officer. \"These changes should put Pullmantur on a more successful course for the future.\"\nTHIRD QUARTER RESULTS\nNet Yields on a Constant-Currency basis increased 5.1% during the quarter, approximately 130 basis points better than the mid-point of previous guidance. Close-in Caribbean and European demand and strong performance in Asia more than off-set further weakness in Latin America . Onboard Revenue Yield increased 10% mainly driven by strong retail and beverage sales and demand for VOOM, the fastest internet at sea.\nAdjusted Net Income for the third quarter of 2015 was $628.1 million , or $2.84 per share, compared to Adjusted Net Income of $492.9 million , or $2.20 per share, in the third quarter of 2014. US GAAP Net Income for the third quarter 2015 was $228.8 million or $1.03 per share, which includes $399.3 million in non-cash impairment charges related to the Pullmantur brand. As a means of comparison, US GAAP Net Income for the third quarter 2014 was $490.2 million or $2.19 per share.\nConstant-Currency NCC excluding fuel decreased 1.8%. Bunker pricing net of hedging for the third quarter was $590 per metric ton and consumption was 339,000 metric tons.\nFULL YEAR 2015\nThe company raised full year Adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $4.80 per share. Constant-Currency Net Yields are expected to increase approximately 3.5%, back in line with the mid-point of January guidance. NCC excluding fuel are expected to be flat to down 1% on a Constant-Currency basis.\nYear-over-year, the company has made a number of structural changes which are driving a stronger fourth quarter. The growth of the Asia-Pacific region, including Quantum of the Seas sailing in China , boosts earnings in the typically lighter shoulder season. The addition of new capacity, with Anthem of the Seas joining the fleet, efforts to drive incremental Onboard Revenue, and a continued focus on cost efficiencies also contribute to a stronger end of the year.\n\"As we have reiterated throughout the year, we remain ahead on both pricing and volume versus same time last year,\" said Jason T. Liberty , chief financial officer. \"While Latin America is stressing yields in the fourth quarter, strong year-over-year pricing in the Caribbean , and the addition of capacity in China , will solidify this fourth quarter as the best in our company's history.\"\nTaking into account current fuel pricing, interest rates, currency exchange rates and the factors detailed above, the company expects 2015 Adjusted EPS to be approximately $4.80 per share.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2015\nConstant-Currency Net Yields are expected to be up in the range of 4.5% to 5.0% in the fourth quarter of 2015, and NCC excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 4.0%.\nBased on current fuel pricing, interest rates and currency exchange rates and the factors detailed above, the company expects fourth quarter Adjusted EPS to be approximately $0.90 per share.\n2016 OUTLOOK\nThe company is experiencing good early booking trends for 2016. Booked load factors and APDs are higher than same time last year and the booking window has extended. Management is excited by the 2016 introduction of Harmony of the Seas starting in Europe next summer and adding Ovation of the Seas to its Chinese platform to take advantage of the strong reception this class of ships has received there. While still early in the booking cycle, the view for 2016 is encouraging, and the company expects another year of solid yield and earnings growth.\n\"As we turn the corner into 2016 we have our sights firmly set on our 2017 Double-Double targets,\" said Richard D. Fain , chairman and chief executive officer. \"Next year represents a positive step on that journey.\"\nFUEL EXPENSE AND SUMMARY OF KEY GUIDANCE STATS\nFuel Expense\nThe company does not forecast fuel prices and its fuel cost calculations are based on current at-the-pump prices, net of hedging impacts. Based on today's fuel prices the company has included $193 million and $800 million of fuel expense in its fourth quarter and full year 2015 guidance, respectively.\nForecasted consumption is 57% hedged via swaps for the remainder of 2015 and 65%, 59%, 40% and 10% hedged for 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. For the same five-year period, the average cost per metric ton of the hedge portfolio is approximately $608 , $538 , $501, $462 and $417, respectively.\nThe company provided the following fuel statistics for the fourth quarter and full year 2015:\nFUEL STATISTICS\nFourth Quarter 2015\nFull Year 2015\nFuel Consumption (metric tons)\n342,000\n1,363,000\nFuel Expenses\n$193 million\n$800 million\nPercent Hedged (fwd consumption)\n57%\n57%\nImpact of 10% change in fuel prices\n$5.0 million\n$5.0 million\nIn summary, the company provided the following guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015:\nGUIDANCE\nAs-Reported Constant-Currency\nFourth Quarter 2015\nNet Yields\n1.3% to 1.8%\n4.5% to 5.0%\nNet Cruise Costs per APCD\nApprox.

The company noted that scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are $0.2 billion , $0.9 billion , $0.9 billion , $2.1 billion and $0.6 billion , respectively.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CAPACITY GUIDANCE\nBased upon current ship orders, projected capital expenditures for full year 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are $1.6 billion , $2.3 billion , $0.5 billion , $2.4 billion and $1.3 billion , respectively.\nCapacity increases for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 are expected to be 5.4%, 6.4%, 3.4%, 3.7% and 6.6%, respectively. These figures do not include potential ship sales or additions that we may elect to make in the future.\nCONFERENCE CALL SCHEDULED\nThe company has scheduled a conference call at 10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time today to discuss its earnings. This call can be heard, either live or on a delayed basis, on the company's investor relations web site at www.rclinvestor.com .\nSelected Operational and Financial Metrics\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income represents net income excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included the impairment of the Pullmantur related assets, restructuring charges, other costs related to our profitability initiatives, the estimated impact of the divested Pullmantur non-core businesses for periods prior to the sales transaction, the loss recognized on the sale of a vessel and the impact of the change in our voyage proration. The estimated impact of the divested Pullmantur non-core businesses was arrived at by adjusting the net income (loss) of these businesses for the ownership percentage we retained as well as for intercompany transactions that are no longer eliminated in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) subsequent to the sales transaction.\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\")\nRepresents Adjusted Net Income divided by the diluted shares outstanding at the end of the reporting period. We believe this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.\nAvailable Passenger Cruise Days (\"APCD\")\nAPCD is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenues and expenses to vary.\nConstant-Currency\nWe believe Net Yields, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel are our most relevant non-GAAP financial measures. However, a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US Dollar. Because our reporting currency is the US Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in US Dollars will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor Net Yields, Net Cruise Costs, and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel on a \"Constant-Currency\" basis – i.e. as if the current period's currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period's rates. We calculate \"Constant-Currency\" by applying the average prior year period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and/or forecasted period, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant-Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.\nGross Cruise Costs\nGross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.\nGross Yields\nGross Yields represent total revenues per APCD.\nNet Cruise Costs (\"NCC\") and Net Cruise Costs (\"NCC\") Excluding Fuel\nRepresent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, fuel expenses. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected Gross Cruise Costs to projected Net Cruise Costs and projected Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at these measures. Accordingly, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful. For the periods prior to the sale of the Pullmantur non-core businesses, Net Cruise Costs excludes the estimated impact of these divested businesses. Net Cruise Costs also excludes initiative costs reported within cruise operating expenses and marketing, selling and administrative expenses.\nNet Revenues\nNet Revenues represent total revenues less commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses. For the periods prior to the sale of the Pullmantur non-core businesses, we have presented Net Revenues excluding the estimated impact of these divested businesses.\nNet Yields\nNet Yields represent Net Revenues per APCD. We utilize Net Revenues and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that it is the most relevant measure of our pricing performance because it reflects the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of projected Gross Yields to projected Net Yields due to the significant uncertainty in projecting the costs deducted to arrive at this measure. Accordingly, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful. For the periods prior to the sale of the Pullmantur non-core businesses, Net Yields excludes the estimated impact of these divested businesses.\nOccupancy\nOccupancy, in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.\nPassenger Cruise Days\nPassenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.
