Pictures: Jessie Rose Parker. \nIt’s just gone eight in the morning and I am bent double inside what can only be described as a stone sarcophagus. Known as the Dwarfie Stane, this remarkable burial chamber, unique to the British Isles and of unknown antiquity, is situated on a remote moor at the north end of Hoy, one of some seventy islands that make up Orkney. \nPossibly neolithic – possibly not – the inner chambers were carved from a mighty block of Devonian red sandstone some 6,000 years ago. The craftsmanship is simply breathtaking – which is a recurring feature of Orkney, a true land apart that continues to give historians new insights into how our early ancestors lived. \nGrowing up in West Cornwall, with its profusion of antiquities, it was almost impossible not to be enthused by the monuments left by our forebears. From Lanyon Quoit and the enigmatic holed stones of Carn Kenidjack to Pendeen Vau fougou and the Merry Maidens, the western tip of Cornwall is stuffed with well-preserved sites. A general interest in pre-history has since led me to investigate sites in Ireland, Brittany, Egypt, Avebury, Cantabria, the Western Isles... and a host of other locations where humans have erected stones to their gods or simply constructed practical living spaces. \nHowever, nothing quite prepares the amateur or professional archaeologist for the sheer number and quality of relics on Orkney. And you don’t need to know a thing about the mesolithic or the neolithic or the difference between the bronze and iron ages to marvel at what our ancestors were capable of. \nTake the Knap of Howar on a tiny eastern isle called Papa Westray. A neolithic farmstead, it is believed to be the oldest preserved stone house in northern Europe, having been first inhabited around 3700BC. Papa Westray is a remote rock, home to 70 humans and several thousand seabirds. Taking a stroll along the coast to this most ancient of properties, you will come across untouched Viking boat slipways hidden in the reeds and medieval farmsteads complete with midden dumps disgorging thousands of discarded bones and limpet shells – the supper of a distant clan. The Knap of Howar itself is no pile of stones, but an expertly-constructed set of rooms with slab floor, carved seating, archways and even a quern. Those neolithic masons certainly knew a thing or two about longevity; the un-mortared stonework is as tight as when it went up almost six millennia ago. \nDespite its great antiquity, the Knap of Howar probably sees only a very few visitors in the course of a year compared to Orkney’s main attractions. Older than Stonehenge and the Great Pyramids, Skara Brae – Europe’s most complete neolithic village, discovered in the 1960s – has been called the “Scottish Pompeii” because of its state of preservation. With a museum, replica house, informed guides and location on the picturesque Bay of Skaill, Skara Brae is up there with the world’s great sites. Then there is the mighty Ring of Brodgar stone circle, Maeshowe chambered cairn that proves both the ingenuity and sophistication of neolithic peoples, and the Ness of Brodgar which many are claiming to be the most important archaeological excavation in the world. This nucleus make up the “Heart of Neolithic Orkney” World Heritage Site – but having visited several of the other islands it’s slightly baffling that UNESCO didn’t grant the same status to the entire archipelago. \nOrkney isn’t just about the past, though. It has thriving communities on the largest island, Mainland, as well as on Hoy, Westray, South Ronaldsay, North Ronaldsay, Rousay and others. A haven for seabirds – you can’t go far without spotting puffins, terns, skuas or guillemots – the islands are popular with walkers, anglers, sailors, and those who enjoy seafood. They are also a magnet for Second World War enthusiasts who flock to see the many still-visible wrecks of 1940s naval ships and a charming Italian Chapel built by prisoners of war out of two Nissan huts. \nHowever, as fascinating as these other diversions may be, and despite the fact that Orkney is invariably cold, windy and often wet, it is the archaeology that would take me back there again and again. The concentration and variety of sites seems inexhaustible. \nAnd that’s why I found myself, along with two companions, lying “three in a bed” across the Dwarfie Stane’s individual stone coffins at 8 o’clock on a bright and blustery August morning... what do you mean it’s not everyone’s idea of a summer holiday? \nOrkney can be reached by a variety of routes, including a two-day drive (Penzance to John O’Groats 830 miles or 14 hours) to the northern tip of Scotland, followed by a ferry to Stromness, Kirkwall or St Margaret’s Hope. We flew with Flybe from Exeter to Kirkwall via Manchester and Aberdeen, which is not as arduous as it sounds.
