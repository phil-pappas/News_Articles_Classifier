He said that he is confident that Mr. Ban Ki-moon would steer the UN through another year of progressive dialogue and give overall guidance. \nIn view of the 70th anniversary of the organization, President Michel urged that the international community renew the spirit of the Charter, and more importantly reinvigorate it in light of the trend of our times and the needs of the modern world. \nSeychelles has been at the forefront in advocating solutions to problems faced by Small Island Developing States (SIDS). As such, President Michel expressed his gratitude to the Secretary General for his support in that endeavor. \nPresident Michel further added that climate change has become the foremost security challenge for SIDS. Although the SIDS community continues to be one of the smallest contributors to global emissions, small islands are the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of the phenomenon. \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-Moon shared President Michel's hope that a binding agreement on climate change would emerge from the Paris Conference in Paris at the end of this year. \nPresident Michel also expressed his desire that the global community unite in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, he called on all developed countries to fulfill their commitments for the mobilization of $100 billion annually by 2020 for the operationalization of the Green Climate Fund (GCF). \nPresident Michel briefed the Secretary-General on the Blue Economy which Seychelles is spearheading to protect its greatest natural resources - the ocean - and derive benefit from it for its people. \nOn his part, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke about the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and hoped that concrete action would be taken in order to achieve its primary objectives. He expressed his desire that in the year 2030 when stock is taken, the world can safely assert that all points within the Agenda were adequately satisfied. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
