Adventure Life is offering just that with its eight-day/seven-night river cruise through Vietnam and Cambodia. The Dec. 28 departure, usually priced at $3,099 per person double occupancy, is being discounted to $2,099. The cruise starts in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake and ends at Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In between, there will be explorations of wetlands, visits to workshops of coppersmiths, silversmiths and silk-makers, and an exploration of Cambodia's capital of Phnom Penh, including the haunting Genocide Museum. Once in Vietnam, there will be cruising on the Mekong River, including a tour by boat of the fascinating floating market in Cai Be. In addition to the usual cruise amenities, the price includes complimentary wine, beer and spirits.

The all-inclusive retreat, Jan. 5-10, is aimed at getting the new year off to a healthy start. Guests will participate in Reggaelates, a workout that combines Pilates, yoga and reggae music. There will also be paddleboard yoga, sunset stretches, spa treatments and a cleanse-focused menu. Cleansing doesn't come cheap. The package is priced from $6,000 per person based on single occupancy or $7,000 per couple. International airfare to Ian Fleming International Airport is extra.

For travelers, the lists can be a worthwhile read just because they might turn you on to a destination or attraction that's never crossed your radar. Sunset magazine ventured into the travel awards field this year, surprisingly its first foray given that the magazine that covers 13 Western states has been around since the late 1800s, begun as a promotional magazine for the Southern Pacific Railroad. An example of an attraction you probably haven't heard of is the mag's top pick for best hotel pool in the West: Glenwood Hot Springs and Spa of the Rockies in Glenwood Springs, Colo. The pool measures an impressive 100 feet by 405 feet and holds more than a million gallons of mineral water cooled to 90-93 degrees. Another surprise comes along in the best arts town, headed by, of all places, Pasadena, Calif., and beating out such artsy places as Aspen, Colo., and Taos, N.M. The city \"has made an extraordinary commitment to the arts,\" according to one judge. Who'd-a-thunk?
