He had pleaded guilty and was convicted yesterday of 13 charges under the Travel Agents Act and Regulations and was fined a total of S$19,500 (US$13,670). Yam's license had expired on December 31, 2013 and was not able to renew it as he could not meet the financial criteria for licence renewal under the aforementioned legislation. Despite lacking a license, Yam was found to have carried on the business of a travel manager via Uniglobal Holidays from January 1, 2014 to April 14, 2014. Investigations also revealed that Uniglobal Holidays had failed to deliver about S$140,000 worth of travel products paid for by Russia-based tourists. Under the Travel Agents Act and Regulations, any person found guilty of carrying on the business of a travel manager without a valid licence faces a maximum fine of S$10,000 and/or imprisonment up to two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:24:41.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
