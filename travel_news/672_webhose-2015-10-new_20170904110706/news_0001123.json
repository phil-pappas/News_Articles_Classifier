Measured in revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), demand increased by 7.4% reflecting broad support on both short and long haul routes. Combined with the 6.2% expansion in available seat capacity, the average international passenger load factor edged 0.8 percentage points higher to 77.2% for the month.\nAir cargo markets remained subdued, with demand in freight tonne kilometre (FTK) terms only matching the same month last year. After accounting for a 2.3% increase in offered freight capacity, the average international freight load factor fell by 1.5 percentage points to 62.7% for the month.\nCommenting on the results, Mr. Andrew Herdman, AAPA Director General said, “Overall, international air passenger demand has seen robust growth during the past nine months, as reflected in the 8.3% increase in the number of international passengers carried by Asia Pacific airlines to reach a combined total of 206.1 million. Leisure travel markets remained buoyant, driving the continued growth in demand.”\nMr. Herdman added, “Air cargo markets have weakened in recent months following the slowdown in world trade. The region’s carriers experienced a 1.1% year-on-year decline in air cargo demand during the third quarter of 2015, after registering a 4.5% increase during the first half of the year. As a result, air cargo growth for the first nine months narrowed to 2.6% compared to the same period last year.”\nMr. Herdman concluded, “The operating environment for Asian airlines remains challenging, complicated by the effects of slowing economic growth in emerging markets, and associated exchange rate volatility. However, the continued growth in travel demand and lower oil prices have been a positive factor, helping to keep air fares affordable. Overall, Asia Pacific airlines’ profitability is showing modest improvement in an intensely competitive market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:37:06.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
