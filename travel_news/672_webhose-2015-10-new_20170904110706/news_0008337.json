I ended up in Chile thanks to a government programme, Start-Up Chile. They fund entrepreneurs to bring their companies to Chile for 6 months. \nWhat do you do there? I work on growing our business, Trailblazer . As part of the deal with Start-Up Chile, I also mentor some local entrepreneurs and give talks to students. On the side, I do some contracting web design for clients in New Zealand. What are the greatest advantages to living there? The change in perspective that comes from throwing yourself into a place so completely different. The language is an obvious curveball, but it's more interesting watching how people live. Long lunch breaks, late dinners and spectacular barbecues. Also, if it rains, everything gets cancelled. Disadvantages? Bad air, bad coffee, and it's very inefficient. You learn patience in Chile. The weirdest thing I encountered is when you're paying for things, it's very common to line up twice. One queue to pay for your item, and the other to hand over your proof of payment and collect your stuff. How expensive is it compared to New Zealand? How much is a beer? Everything is about 50 to 80 per cent of the cost. You can get a litre of a reasonable domestic beer for about 2000 Chilean Peso, which is about $4.50. What do you do in your spare time? I like to go on long walks and get completely lost. \nSantiago is the capital of Chile and has a population of 5.1 million. Image: Supplied Kiwi expats: What's your tale? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nWhat's the local delicacy and would you recommend eating it? \nThe empanada is the local equivalent of the meat pie. It's a folded pastry with a mix of ingredients - the classic is mince, egg and an olive. Dangerously delicious. \nEasiest way to get around? The subway, or hail a cab. You can walk as well, but it can take a deceptively long time. \nWhat's the shopping like? I'm too poor to buy things. \nBest after-dark activity? There are lots of great events on all the time, like full moon festivals. The nightlife is pretty decent as well. \nBest time of year to visit? September onwards. In Chile, you have the national holiday week around September 18, and as it gets warmer, the city really comes to life. \nWhat are the top three things you recommend for visitors? The Santiago Free Tour. If you go in the afternoon, you'll probably get Felipe, who gives a very memorable tour of the city. Barrio Lastarria in the weekend - lots of street performances, artists selling their wares, and great food. Valparaiso, a little port town about an hour and a half by bus from Santiago. It's an absolute jewel - visit Pablo Neruda's house if you're there. Ad Feedback \nBesides family and friends, what do you miss most about home? The easy access to nature (applies less in smalltown Chile), and the efficiency. We really have our act together when it comes to things like paying your restaurant bill or doing your banking online. \nHow easy is it for you to get back to NZ? Dead simple. It's a direct flight from Santiago to Auckland. But frankly, I'm probably going to cancel the return fare and tumbleweed across South America for a while. \nFor Kiwis looking to move there, which industries are seeking fresh talent? The local tech industry! Start-Up Chile have an intake of 80+ teams every three months, and a lot of them are hiring. \nKnow an expat who wants to share inside knowledge of their home away from home?
