A properly equipped mobile command center is a response and recovery vehicle that facilitates an agency's ability to expand their command and control capabilities to a remote location. Full interoperable communications are a standard for the mobile command center. For the emergency management agency, the vehicle is an extension of the fixed base emergency operations center. The vehicle should be built with long-term deployment in mind but also be easy to operate in order to allow for quick deployment by minimum personnel if necessary. The successful design of a mobile command center will dictate the frequency of use. In other words, the more difficult to move and operate, the fewer deployments. Command and Control: In the law enforcement environment, the vehicle can be utilized for command and control as well as hostage negotiations and even as a mobile precinct. Full law enforcement dispatch capabilities can be installed as well as back-up systems to the 9-1-1 Center. Incident Command: The fire service unit, properly equipped, gives the incident commander the visibility and informational flow along with space for ICS functional personnel all in one area. A meeting area for functional ICS officers to share and evaluate information with the IC is necessary.
