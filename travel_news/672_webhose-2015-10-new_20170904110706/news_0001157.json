The cruise line is launching a new brand campaign inviting these seekers to \" Come Seek \" their own experience filled with adventure, exploration and discovery.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7657051-royal-caribbean-come-seek\n\" Come Seek \" reflects the brand's adventurous spirit by placing the traveler's personal experience and point of view at the heart of the campaign. It also showcases the essence of the experience that the brand has been delivering for more than 40 years. Known for its innovation – including the revolutionary Oasis- and Quantum-class ships – and delivering many industry-firsts from ziplines and rock climbing walls, the FlowRider surf simulator and the RipCord by iFly skydiving experience, to leading technological breakthroughs like VOOM – the fastest internet at sea, Royal Caribbean continues to transform the cruise experience offering an active adventure with an immersive experience and connectivity that all travelers desire.\n\"Our mission is to challenge misperceptions and invite the next generation of travelers to experience the unique Royal Caribbean adventure,\" said Michael Bayley , president & CEO, Royal Caribbean International. \"Our loyal guests recognize that Royal Caribbean is an adventure designed to inspire and excite the senses. With our new campaign, we will show these new travelers what our guests already know and love.\"\nEven as the cruise industry has grown on the strength of new ships and modern program offerings, the reality is that a majority of the population – particularly the millennial generation – has never taken a cruise. The new campaign is not only an invitation from Royal Caribbean to \"Come Seek,\" but aims squarely at conventions that may inhibit continued growth.\nThe integrated marketing campaign includes broadcast, digital and outdoor advertising, in addition to public relations, social media and direct marketing. The multi-million dollar campaign will debut on Monday, October 19 th with a series of broadcast and online ads, including a first-of-its-kind live streaming outdoor campaign delivered via the social platform Periscope.\n\" Come Seek \" is a call to travelers who want more than to sightsee along the beaten path. It's for adventurers who don't just want, but require, immersive, culturally rich travel. Royal Caribbean delivers adventure both onboard and with exciting and culturally rich experiences in destinations around the world. Seekers are introduced to these destinations with experiential excursions, such as an Ocean Racing Experience in Antigua , which matches two guest teams of six each with professional yachties in head to head competition, and a Mountain Top Downhill Trek through historic plantation ruins in St. Maarten .\nFor a sneak peek of the \"Come Seek\" campaign elements visit Royal Caribbean's YouTube page.\nRoyal Caribbean International is an award-winning global cruise brand with a 46-year legacy of innovation and introducing industry \"firsts\" never before seen at sea. The cruise line features an expansive and unmatched array of features and amenities only found on Royal Caribbean including jaw-dropping, Broadway-style entertainment and industry-acclaimed programming that appeals to families and adventurous vacationers alike. Onboard, guests are catered to with the cruise line's world-renowned friendly and engaging Gold Anchor Service by every staff and crew member.
