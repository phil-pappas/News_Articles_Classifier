Not one evening in 12 was listed as “casual.”\nExplained a British passenger on the ship, Queen Mary 2: “This is a crossing, not a cruise.”\nVacationers who prefer not to stand out like worn driftwood in a sea of elegant penguins will want to know the difference before booking a voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.\nIn the waters between Europe and North America, cruises are relatively frequent occurrences twice a year, in spring and fall as ships make repositioning voyages. From September through November, ships move west from their summer season itineraries to warmer winter climes in the Caribbean. Next spring, many ships will head back east, most of them to the Mediterranean.\nThese trans-Atlantic repositioning cruises seldom are fully booked. They tend to draw passengers with plenty of time on their hands who are lured by bargain rates, as low as $70 to $100 a night, and lazy sea days, as many as seven or eight.\nYou don’t see much in the way of fancy clothes on these laid-back, casual cruises — emphasis on the word casual.\nIn contrast, sea days on a Queen Mary 2 crossing, of a week or more, are as close as you’ll get these days to a formal affair. The crossing is a grand voyage with proper afternoon teas, dressy dinners and evening balls in the style of last century’s golden age of travel, when movie stars, business elite and the moneyed set laughed, ate and danced their way between continents.\nEven in the Britannia Dining Room, which serves the majority of the ship’s passengers who are lodging in the least expensive of the Cunard Line’s cabins, ladies are met at the door each evening by formally clad waiters who escort them to their well-set tables.\n“First-timers should be prepared for the formality,” said Robert Howie, hotel director on Queen Mary 2. “Our regular guests keep coming back because they don’t get many opportunities at home to dress up and socialize among like-minded people.”\nFormality is embraced by most passengers, who toss off their daytime casual clothes as 6 p.m. approaches. The ship’s male passengers, a majority of them from the United Kingdom, always wear, at the minimum, a jacket during the evenings, whether they are in a bar, in the dining rooms or on deck for a party around the pools. With today’s reduced luggage allowances on airlines, most women do not wear ball gowns.\nSeldom will you see T-shirts and flip-flops after 6 p.m., except in the cafeteria or the Winter Garden, which are the lone public spaces reserved for such casualness that does not include shorts and blue or worn denim (for men and women), sandals and sleeveless tops (for men). After 6 p.m., “They are not considered appropriate within the ship,” says a note from Cunard. I suspect that no one cares what you wear in your own cabin, where you could consume dinner from room service in your underwear.\nThe 2,600-passenger Queen Mary 2, Cunard’s flagship, is the only ship to cross the North Atlantic on a regularly scheduled itinerary from spring deep into fall. The voyage consumes about a week, occasionally adding some extra days for port stops on either end of its basic route between Southampton, south of London, and New York. My cruise stopped in Liverpool, Halifax and Boston.\nA crossing on Queen Mary 2 in the North Atlantic is a reminder of successful and failed crossings of the past 175 years, as ships brought thousands of immigrants from east to west to start new lives, and moved thousands of troops west to east to help end world wars.\nFittingly, as Cunard operated the first regularly scheduled passenger ship between England and North America, the Britannia in 1840, now it operates what could be the last, as the expensive Queen Mary 2 is likely too expensive to replace.\nFailures at sea are remembered as well in the often tempestuous North Atlantic. The ship’s horn blasted a memorial note as we passed less than 2 miles from the geographical spot above the hulk of the Titanic, which lies on the ocean floor. The Titanic was not a Cunard ship, though a Cunard ship, the Carpathia, heroically rushed through icy waters to rescue the 705 Titanic passengers who were lucky enough to survive that 1912 disaster.\nDavid Molyneaux is editor of thetravelmavens.com.\nWhen you go Rates vary on Queen Mary 2 crossings, depending on cabins (top-end stateroom passengers have their own dining rooms, lounge and sun deck) and time of year. Printed rates start at about $800 per person, though I saw a $600 fare advertised by a travel agent in July. Cunard Line ( cunard.com ) also operates Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth. These latter two ships tend to be slightly less formal than Queen Mary 2, especially when they cruise in warmer climates.\nIf you are looking for a bargain repositioning cruise, here are a few, starting in late October as listed by travel agents. Prices on these cruises may vary by a few hundred dollars, depending on what is included, but all of these cruises offer rates for inside cabins that start at less than $100 a night, per person.\nOct. 29, from Barcelona to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Norwegian Jade, 16 nights starting at $1,459 with on-board credits worth as much as $800; Nov. 9, Holland America’s Prinsendam, for 15 nights from Rome to Fort Lauderdale, $1,100 including on-board credits; and Dec. 2, Ocean Princess, 18 nights from Rome to Miami, $1,799.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:10:16.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
