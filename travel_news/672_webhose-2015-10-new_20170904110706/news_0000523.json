BA also has 12 B787-10s on order.\nThere will be eight seats in first class, compared to the 14 fitted on other BA long-haul aircraft.\nEach seat will include three new storage areas - a new ottoman next to the adjustable footstool; the personal suiter for jackets and coats is now accessible without having to leave the seat; and a new locker at eye-level for smaller items. A mirror has been fitted to the inside of the locker door.\nInside the new First cabin\nThe aircraft will be fitted with its next generation First cabin, making it the first European airline to install the top class on a Dreamliner. China Southern was the first worldwide to have first on the Dreamliner.\nBA's current B787-8 is fitted with three cabins — Club World, World Traveller Plus and World Traveller. Its B787-9, which is slightly larger and can fly longer sectors, will with the addition of First have a four-class configuration.\nA new IFE handset, which BA said is \"much like a smartphone\", will allow passengers to watch one item on the handset itself and another on the 23-inch screen.\nLastly, the smart \"jog-dial\" still controls the seat's recline, but now also manages five further functions including the headrest and lighting control.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5fVcMSjoVM", "https://twitter.com/BBT_online"], "published": "2015-10-01T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:36:33.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
