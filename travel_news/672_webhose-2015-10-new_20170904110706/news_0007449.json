For pension savers – especially today, when retirees have greater control over their assets and are not required to buy an income-paying annuity – the question is central to their financial planning. For most, income is in short supply and needs to be maximised. But what would happen if too much were withdrawn, capital values fell, and the income source dried up? Generations of investors have pondered the problem, and some claim to have developed strategies that solve it. The 4pc rule It should not be viewed as the magic formula, but the “4pc rule” – widely used by pension savers in America – is well respected and popular with financial advisers here in Britain. The premise is that 4pc is the maximum amount that can be safely withdrawn from a pension each year over any 30-year retirement. Although your portfolio’s capital value might fall, your income payments – starting at 4pc of your initial capital and increasing yearly in line with inflation thereafter – will always be met, at least for those three decades. The number was not plucked out of thin air. It was based on work undertaken two decades ago by an American former financial planner, William Bengen, who has now retired. It was an exercise designed purely to help pensioners maximise their retirement savings while minimising the risk of running out of cash. The theory was given the thumbs up by another academic paper a couple of years later, which put the chances of success at 95pc. This assumed that savers would split their pension portfolios into two, with half in shares and half in bonds. Both studies arrived at their conclusions following analysis of US stock market and bond returns over almost 100 years. Can it also work for British retirees who want to stick to their home market when investing their pension? According to a recent study in 2010 by Wade Pfau, professor of retirement income at the American College of Financial Services, the answer is yes. The probability of failure – again taking 4pc per year, plus inflation, within a three-decade period – is 9pc. This is based on a portfolio invested equally in UK shares and British government bonds. It looked back at 109 years of financial market data (between 1900 and 2008), considering the prospect of individuals retiring in every year of the time frame. For those who withdraw 5pc a year the chances of failure jumped dramatically, to 56pc. Abraham Okusanya of Finalytiq, a financial planning consultancy, is a fan of the 4pc rule, because it reduces the risk of “pound cost ravaging” – a term that describes the negative effect that regular withdrawals can have if they are made after markets have fallen. It can mean your portfolio becomes locked in a spiral of decline, with successive withdrawals eating away at its value. Mr Okusanya believes 4pc is a sufficiently low figure not to pose that risk. But in protracted periods of ultra-low returns, as now, some would find the 4pc rule too risky. Instead, to be safe, investors are advised to take only the “natural yield”, leaving the capital untouched. Natural yields comprise actual income thrown off by investments, such as dividends paid by companies or the interest – or “coupon” – paid by bonds. The natural yield of a portfolio made up of a 50/50 split of UK shares and bonds would currently fall below 4pc. This is the main argument against Mr Bengen’s theory: that he developed it when bond yields were much higher, at around 5pc to 6pc. Another criticism is that the probability of success is hugely dependent on precisely when people retire. Your chances of success are far greater if you are lucky enough to retire at the beginning of a bull market. Those who start withdrawing when the market is past its peak, or on the decline, do not have the odds in their favour. Analysis by T Rowe Price, the American fund manager, found that those who first started drawing an income from their portfolio in 2000 and followed the 4pc rule would have lost a third of their assets by 2010. The market timing could not have been worse, thanks to the two severe stock market sell-offs over the period. But Justin Modray of Candid Financial Advice pointed out that the risk of this happening could be minimised by building a cash savings buffer. Pension savers could also follow the “Warren Buffett method”, as outlined in instructions to the executors of his will on how money he left to his wife should be invested for her retirement. He said: “My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: put 10pc of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90pc in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund.” British savers could choose a similar fund that tracks the FTSE 100. His plan is a variation of the cash buffer. Essentially, it allows the bulk of money to remain invested. This portfolio will produce some income naturally and the extra 10pc in short-term government bonds will regularly release more cash – through the maturing bonds – if it is needed. Of course, as many financial planners point out, there is a danger in being too cautious, especially in the early years of retirement. Spending down capital, or taking a level of income that is higher than either the natural yield or 4pc, will be perfectly sensible – and safe – for some. • Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of our investment ideas • Find out our five golden rules for DIY investing The Telegraph has launched its own DIY investment service, designed with simple pricing.
