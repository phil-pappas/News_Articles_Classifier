The award follows a competitive tender which saw participation from 10 tenderers.\n \n \nThe scope of this contract represents the first of several packages of works to be undertaken for Changi Airport to operationalise a three-runway system by the early 2020s. The works to be executed by the JV include pavement works, drainage works, security fencing and perimeter roads, mechanical and electrical works, as well as supporting works such as major services and road diversions.\n \n \nChangi Airport currently operates two runways, serving its three terminals as well as the upcoming Terminal 4. To ensure adequate runway capacity for the airport’s continued growth beyond this decade as well as to cater to the future Terminal 5, CAG will be converting an existing third runway (Runway 3) — which is currently used by the military — for joint civil-military use. The JV will extend this runway to handle larger aircraft, and develop supporting taxiways to connect Runway 3 to the rest of Changi Airport.\n \n \nOther works to be carried out by the JV include the construction of canals and drainage systems that will keep the runway and taxiways free of surface water and prevent flooding, thus improving the safety and operational resilience of the airfield.\n \n \nTo support three-runway operations at Changi Airport, airfield specialised systems including airfield lighting, surveillance and detection systems, will also be installed as part of the works. Ancillary buildings including airfield lighting control centres, as well as a fire station and related rescue facilities will be developed.\n \n \nMr Yam Kum Weng, CAG’s Executive Vice President, Air Hub and Development, said, “In addition to terminal capacity, airfield capacity is a critical determinant of an airport’s growth potential. Hence, the operationalisation of a three-runway system is a crucial part of Changi Airport’s development plans.\n \n \n“The additional runway capacity brought about by a three-runway system will take Changi to its next phase of growth beyond this decade. The extension of Runway 3, together with the new taxiway system linking to the existing Changi Airport, will total about 40 kilometres. A whole suite of supporting infrastructure and airfield systems will also be built to support three-runway operations.\n \n \n“We look forward to partnering the Samsung C&T-Koh Brothers joint venture to ensure that high safety standards are maintained, with minimum impact on ongoing airfield operations throughout the construction.”\n \n \nMr. Chi Hun Choi, President and CEO of Samsung C&T Corporation, said: “We appreciate this exciting opportunity to participate in this key project for the expansion of Changi Airport, and are very pleased to partner Koh Brothers for this. With our combined resources and strong focus on safety and quality, we are fully committed to delivering this project successfully.”\n \n \nSource:- Changi Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:55:49.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
