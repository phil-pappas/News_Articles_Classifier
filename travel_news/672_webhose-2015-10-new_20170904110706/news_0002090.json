And fascinating tunnel networks. \nIt’s a place where travellers not only connect with ancient tribal cultures, but also with compelling Australian wartime stories. For the visitor, the beauty of the landscape and of the people with their big-hearted welcome is striking. \n“The locals are very friendly and they really want us to know their country,” says Sun Princess shore excursions manager Elena Lorini, an Italian who has worked on cruise ships all over the world since 2000. \n“You have more interaction here with locals than a lot of other ports and they put in more effort. I find it amazing. The passengers love it here. It's a completely different destination.” \nOn a recent cruise to PNG on the Sun Princess out of Brisbane, our 2000 passengers sail into fascinating ports in Rabaul, Alotau in Milne Bay and Kiriwina and Doini islands, where they adventure ashore to interact with locals in a big way. \nThey paddle us out in canoes to snorkel spots, lead us on foot through villages and schools, dance in tribal costume, sing us heartfelt songs of welcome and tell us about their ancient culture of bride prices, betel nut, mumu food, yams and shell money as currency. \nOur guide in Rabaul describes how he survived the volcano eruption in Rabaul that devastated the town in 1994.

We walked out of town after the game finished and the old people told us to go.” \nPrincess Cruises started cruising to PNG only two years ago, but a dozen more trips are scheduled for next year and 2017. \nWhile Princess and P&O are the main cruise lines, PNG is also attracting attention from others such as Cunard and National Geographic, which sent their first ships in September. \nMilne Bay Province, which takes in the Trobriand Island group and is now a cruise hub, will host an incredible 57 cruise port calls next year. \nWith all this new attention, it's a good idea to get there before it changes. It’s beautiful. \nAt present, life is still simple on the islands, with an innocence and shyness among locals and we found their sightseeing tours ashore to be rough and ready, but surprisingly good. \nWe visited the Rabaul war museum and cemetery, where 1036 soldiers from WWI and WWII from Australia, New Zealand and other countries are buried. \nFor one of our ship passengers from Ballina, this was a personal and emotional pilgrimage as she found the name of a relative listed as missing in action from 1945. \nShe was able to pay tribute to her lost uncle Dick by writing in the memorial record book. \nWe also had on the ship two 94-year-old war veterans who had fought in PNG. \nIt seems a shame that Australians probably know more about the history of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii than that of PNG. It’s worth a look. Picture: Ian—0025 \nFor my 78-year-old father and I, our trip on the Sun Princess was also a trip back in time, as we lived in Madang on the mainland northern coast from 1968 to 1972, where he worked in aviation and we survived a 7.0 magnitude quake. \nAs we walk among the locals, I speak to them in broken Pidgin. “Papa bilong me,” I say and they smile. \nAt the market, they offer Dad a walking stick to buy. Not yet, he replies and they laugh with a thumbs-up. \nIn Rabaul, Diap takes us to WWII Japanese war tunnels, includes barge tunnels that were constructed to hide their shipping activity.

We also see tribal dancing and choirs at a sneak preview of the annual Alotau Festival held in November, which was special because this year marks 40 years since PNG independence. Another tunnel. Picture: Stefan Krasowski \nStill a traditional and religious country of 7.5 million people and 750 different languages, tribal culture is alive on Kiriwina Island in the Trobriand Islands, yams are traded as currency and there are love huts for women to select partners as they like. Locals with red mouths chew betel nut, there are cheeky funny children and market souvenirs for sale, including exotic wooden carvings, sarongs, string bags called bilums, shells and T-shirts. Mingle with the locals. Picture: Christopher Michel \nOne Australian cruise passenger says he has long wanted to visit PNG, but did not want to go through Port Moresby to get there, so a cruise is ideal. \nThe capital can be violent, along with other PNG towns such as Lae, but we see no trouble apart from one handbag snatch in Alotau, which is swiftly dealt with by locals and the bag is returned. American travel agent Beverly Broger, a veteran of 70 cruises, says this is one of her best trips. \n“It was really exotic for us and we absolutely loved it,” she says. \n“Its totally unique.” Port Moresby.
