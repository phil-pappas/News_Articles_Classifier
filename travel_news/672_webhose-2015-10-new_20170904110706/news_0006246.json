Just mention that word and it may conjure up images in our mind of a scene from the movie Jaws . Recent reports of shark attacks along the coast in Florida's Panhandle perhaps make us even more likely to have an adverse reaction. That is all perfectly natural, but experts are telling us not to panic. Actually, I've put together some statistics that might just prove them right. By the Numbers \nFirst of all, before I lose your attention, lets look at the number of shark attacks and fatalities in Florida over the last year. According to the Florida Museum of Natural History, Florida had the most unprovoked attacks in the United States with 28 shark attacks during 2014, five more than in 2013. \nIn another comparison, there were six lightning fatalities within the state and no shark fatalities. \nEven bees, wasps and snakes kill more people each year than sharks. \nFeel better? If not, maybe if you understand the shark and its habits a little more it might help. Super Senses and Feeding Frenzies \nSharks have been around for about 400 million years. Perhaps it is the combination of their super senses that has helped them to survive such a long time. Their keenest sense is smell and it is thought two-thirds of their brain is dedicated to that sense. Other senses include vision, hearing, taste, vibration and electro-perception. \nMy niece can attest to the electro-perception. She went on a diving trip to Figi and came face-to-face with the shark in this photo. It seems that they are attracted to cameras and will often come up and bump the lens before deciding it isn't on their dinner menu. Yikes! \nIn fact, when it comes to the shark's dinner, they normally eat alone, but sometimes are attracted to prey when others are feeding. It is then that they'll wildly chomp and bite (even each other) creating what is known as a feeding frenzy. \nA shark's sense of sight and vibration have a good bit to do with shark attacks. A sudden splash in the water — as when a diver jumps into deep water — will attract the attention of a shark in the vicinity. A shark will often nearly bite the flipper of a snorkeler that was quietly gliding along without splashing. It is believed the reflection of the snorkeler's flipper is preceived as food. The same is true of beach-goers swimming and splashing in the water. It may be a case of mistaken idenity, with the white of skin being mistaken for a bait fish. Ironically, most sharks though are afraid of the bubbles made by divers and seldom will cross above a diver for that reason. However, the Tiger and Great White are not — probably because their large size make them fearless. Reduce Your Risk of Shark Attacks \nRisks should always be minimized whenever possible in any activity. George H. Burgess of the International Shark Attack File, Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida, suggests the following to reduce your risk of a shark attack: Always stay in groups since sharks are more likely to attack a solitary individual. Do not wander too far from shore. Avoid being in the water during darkness or twilight hours when sharks are most active. Do not enter the water if bleeding or you have an open wound. Do not wear shiny jewelry. Avoid uneven tanning and bright colored clothing. Sharks see contrast particularly well. Use extra caution when waters are murky. Do not splash excessively. Favorite hangouts for sharks are the area between sandbars or near steep dropoffs. Stay away from those areas. Do not allow pets in the water because of their erratic movements and splashing. \nAnd, finally... Do not enter the water if sharks are known to be present and get out of the water if sharks are seen. The Bottom Line \nAlways use caution when swimming, snorkeling or diving. All sharks are dangerous and unpredictable, but the Bull and Tiger sharks are particularly aggressive. If confronted by a shark, a hard tap on the snout might stop them from biting. Unfortunately, most people who are attacked do not see the shark before it bites, but remember that the chances of coming into contact with a shark or being bitten are still relatively slim — some say as little as 1 in 11.5 million. In fact, you are more likely to drown first — those numbers are only 1 in 3.5 million.
