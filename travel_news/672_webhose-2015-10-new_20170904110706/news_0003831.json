We were greeted by a live band, champagne and nibbles with a ­traditional Greek dance to get involved with (but don’t worry, you don’t have to!).\nBreakfast is ­extensive, the dinner buffet has a different theme each evening – options while we were there included Italian, French and Mexican – and there are weekly barbecue nights. Some rooms have views of the gardens, others of the sea or mountains – but all vistas are idyllic.\nThere’s no danger of getting bored either. There are two large pools (each with a private bar), tennis and basketball courts, a play park for the kids, a spa, a traditional blue and white chapel and a theatre, plus bars exclusively for guests. Oh, and did I mention the hotel’s private beach?\nWe could have passed the week without leaving the resort but it’s worth getting out.\nThe main town, a 20-minute walk away or five minutes by car, is a quaint port decorated with palm trees, old stone and white buildings and churches. Small fishing boats still bob in and out of the harbour with their daily catch and it’s a perfect place to stop and sip a glass of ouzo on the front, people-watching.\nThe Island: A full moon over Spinalonga\nThere are award-winning restaurants too. We loved Ferryman, a great place to try traditional dishes like dakos (tomatoes, cheese, bread and oil all mixed together to let the flavours infuse) or freshly-caught fish.\nWe also found time for a bit of culture on the island of Spinalonga.\nThis former leper colony, just off-shore in the Gulf of Elounda, is the setting for Victoria Hislop’s debut novel The Island. Take your sun hat though – there’s not much shade.\nAnd if you enjoy your retail therapy, it’s worth taking the 30-minute drive south to Agios Nikolaos.\nWhat was so refreshing was to see the locals taking great pride in their town, and as Elounda is still low on the tourist count, visitors receive such a warm welcome it makes it all the harder to leave.\nCatch it quick – while it stays that way.\nTravel File Must see: Make sure you visit the ancient archaeological site of Knossos.\nBook it: An all-inclusive stay at Elounda Breeze (April to October) starts at €33pp (£25) per night for two in a sea view double, or from €44pp (£30) for two in a suite. vitahotels.gr\nGetting there: easyJet flies to Heraklion with return fares from £57 in April. easyjet.com\nMore info: visitgreece.gr/en/greek_islands/crete\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://vitahotels.gr/", "http://visitgreece.gr/en/greek_islands/crete"], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:41:08.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
