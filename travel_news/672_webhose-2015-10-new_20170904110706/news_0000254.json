Since the first day of operation, Porter has flown more than 360,000 flights and 15 million passengers, as of October 22.\nPorter began service in 2006 with two Bombardier Q400 aircraft and one route between Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and Ottawa. Today, the company has grown to include an all-Canadian Q400 fleet of 26 aircraft and flies to 24 destinations in Canada and the U.S.\n“Our values as an airline are rooted in delivering a customer experience that makes air travel enjoyable,” said Robert Deluce, president and CEO of Porter Airlines. “Since we began operating, these values have set us apart and are what makes us recognized around the world.”\nWith four new destinations launching in 2015, Porter continues to make air travel more accessible and affordable for passengers. Based out of Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (BBTCA), one of the most convenient urban airports in the world, Porter balances modern amenities with retro charm. With features such as airport lounge access for all passengers, leather seats and complimentary wine and beer onboard, Porter takes passengers back to the days when flying was seen as something to look forward to. The recent opening of the pedestrian tunnel, connecting BBTCA to the mainland in less than six minutes, also contributes to the convenience of Porter’s refined approach to air travel.\nNotably in 2015, Porter completed its rollout of 31 JetBlue interline destinations, Porter was the Official Canadian Airline of the Pan Am / Parapan Am Games and the VIPorter loyalty program was relaunched.\nPorter is recognized as North America’s Best Regional Airline as part of the World Airline Awards. Porter is also one of the Best International Airlines according to Condé Nast Traveler’s 2015 Readers’ Choice Awards. It secured ninth place among 20 top global airlines and was the only carrier in the Americas to make the list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:31:43.419+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
