She was born in Chicago, IL on December 4, 1927 to Samuel and Serine Feldman. She met Laurence S. Levenson and they married on February 15, 1949. Annamae was a wonderful and loving wife and mother and Larry was so supportive of everything Annamae did. She was the Westview Country Club Women’s Champion golfer for many years but her passion was her art. Annamae was an incredibly talented artist and created art in many diverse mediums from acrylics to metal sculptures. She, along with several other Miami women artists formed the first Women’s Cooperative Gallery in the southeast. After Larry died in 1985, Annamae was married to Perry Kaye until his death in 2010. She was the sweetest, kindest and most wonderful person in the world and although Alzheimer’s disease robbed her of her mind, nothing could take away her kind and selfless spirit. Annamae also predeceased by her loving brother, Monte, who she adored from the moment she was born. She is survived by her daughter, Shari (Ron) Silvers, son, Richard Levenson, grandchildren, Stephanie (Rick) Schiller, Hilarie (Jed) Gates and Ryan (Caroline) Levenson and 6 great-grandchildren, Jake Geiger, Nick Geiger, Jackson Gates, Patton Schiller, Hannah Gates and John Bodie Levenson as well as her niece and nephews. She will be missed by all who knew and loved her but we can still bask in her inner beauty through the art that she left behind for us to enjoy for a lifetime. A memorial service will be held at Temple Emanuel on Sunday, October 11, 2015 at 2 PM. Sign online guest book at www.edressler.com .
