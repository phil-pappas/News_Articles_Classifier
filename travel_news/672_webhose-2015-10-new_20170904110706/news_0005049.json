The budget will take effect in January.\n \nThe budget funds the operations of Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport in West Mifflin. The airports receive no local tax dollars in funding.\n \n“Airport costs are only a small factor in gaining air service,” Authority CEO Christina Cassotis said. “However, we are happy to introduce a budget that keeps costs trending downward for our airline partners for the third straight year.”\n \nThe budget projects the same amount of enplaned passengers for 2016 as the current fiscal year – 4.15 million.\n \nPittsburgh International Airport has increased its number of nonstop destinations from 37 two years ago to 51 today. Passenger traffic year-to-date is up nearly one percent this year. New airlines Porter, Allegiant, OneJet and Sun Air have fueled the increase in destinations.\n \nThe budget is a 3.44 percent increase from 2015, which included a CPE of $12.90. The authority is expected to finish under budget this year.\n \nMuch of the operating budget is based on aviation safety and security, regulatory issues as well as customer service efforts. Many of the costs are also related to meeting federal regulations that are mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.\n \nSource:- Pittsburgh Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:36:58.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
