Targeting affluent, active consumers who live without compromise, the marketing campaign illustrates how the dynamic SUV offers luxury in action.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7633551-lexus-lx-570-luxury-suv/\n\"The LX is a sophisticated and powerful vehicle that equally appeals to those looking for style and comfort and those seeking adventure,\" said Brian Smith , Lexus vice president of marketing. \"The new LX marketing campaign highlights the vehicle's modern design and engineering that effortlessly bridges high luxury with true ruggedness.\"\nA national television spot and a digital spot showcasing the new vehicle are now airing.\nIn \"Different Routes,\" the national television spot, the LX goes head-to-head in a friendly competition with Lexus' flagship sedan, the LS, climbing a mountain in the iconic Austrian Alps. While the LS demonstrates precision and power by nimbly taking sharp turns on the road, the LX uses its unsurpassed off-road ability to dramatically climb straight up the mountain, crossing the LS's path several times. Both vehicles arrive simultaneously at the luxury resort atop the mountain, demonstrating there's more than one way to the top.\nIn \"Shortcut,\" the digital spot, close-up shots show a vehicle traveling off-road up a rugged mountainside-a tire spinning, a headlamp glowing-and the viewer hears the hum of a high-powered vehicle. An LX bounds into view and cuts across a switchback. The LX crests the top to arrive at a world-class resort, demonstrating its opulence and capability. The couple inside, having chosen the unexpected path to the top, proudly exit the vehicle to kick off their glamorous getaway.\nThe integrated national campaign will appear on broadcast, digital, print and out-of-home media. The TV spots will air during prime time, late night, cable and sports programming, with properties such as Thursday Night Football on CBS, ESPN College Football, English Premiere League soccer on NBC, and the NHL on NBC. On Oct. 22 , a social media event will launch at the start of the Thursday Night Football halftime show with live stunts shot inside the LX simulcast on multiple social platforms. Digital presence for LX includes a rich mobile campaign with Millennial Media, high impact media on UrbanDaddy.com, and an update of the successful Lexus brand magazine on Flipboard. There will also be digital extensions to the broadcast partnerships, plus presence on Hulu. Print media includes luxury titles such as Conde Nast Traveler, Architectural Digest , Robb Report and DuJour.\nThe two spots are available for viewing at youtube.com/LexusVehicles .\nAbout Lexus\nLexus launched in 1989 with two luxury sedans and a commitment to pursue perfection.
