(Photo: Andrea Johnson) \nThe total solar eclipse that moves diagonally across the country on Aug. 21, 2017, will be the first total solar eclipse visible from the continental United States since 1979. For stellar viewing, meaning where the eclipse will be total and where it will last longer (it’s measured in minutes), the closer you can get to the middle of its path, the better. So if you’re planning to travel to more fully experience the eclipse, here are five areas of the country that are on its path. (To view the path and calculated times for each, go to Great American Eclipse .) \nSalem, Ore. \nThe eclipse shadows that fall across the U.S. on Aug. 21, 2017, will first be cast along the coastline, valleys and mountains of Oregon, with Salem one of several cities in the path of totality. Eola Hills Wine Cellars in neighboring Eola-Amity Hills plans to offer a scenic view of the eclipse and a weekend filled with wine country activities. The winery has three tasting rooms in Rickrell, Legacy Vineyard and McMinnville and is arranging to work with other nearby wineries to offer tasting deals. Eola Hills will also partner with nearby Polk County Fairgrounds to host RV and tent lodging for visitors staying for the entire weekend. A giant country barbecue following the totality on Monday morning will help close the celebrations. The winery is still planning for the eclipse weekend but don’t let that stop you from planning your trip soon. Kristi Reed of The Grand Hotel in Salem says the hotel is almost completely booked for the eclipse. eolahillswinery.com , grandhotelsalem.com , travelsalem.com \nHotels : The Grand Hotel, Red Lion Hotel Salem Restaurants: Wild Pear, table FIVE 08, Roberts Crossing Attractions : Frank Lloyd Wright’s Gordon House, Chachalu Tribal Museum Cultural Center, Baskett Slough National Wildlife Refuge \nJackson Hole Valley in Wyoming holds the promise of some spectacular views during the total solar eclipse. (Photo: Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce) \nJackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park, Wyo. \nVisitors can expect dramatic views of the shadows crossing the wide open spaces of Jackson Hole Valley and the surrounding mountains, whether they’re at a private viewing party or settled in at a public campground. Wyoming Stargazing, an educational nonprofit dedicated to astronomy and creating a public observatory and planetarium in Jackson, will host numerous events in and around the town on the day of the eclipse. The group is collaborating with the community-focused Center for the Arts in downtown Jackson for a large public event; Wyoming Stargazing founder Samuel Singer promises that the location will offer great views of the sky. The group also plans to host private events for select locations, including Spring Creek Ranch and Teton Springs. Attendees will have the opportunity to look through the group’s solar telescopes to learn more about sunspots and solar flares in the sun’s upper atmosphere in addition to receiving assistance with prepping their own cameras to get the best shots. wyomingstargazing.org \nHotels: Hotel Jackson, Amangani and the Lexington at Jackson Hole Restaurants: Persephone Bakery, Snake River Brewing Co., Snake River Grill Attractions: Aerial tram to Rendezvous Peak, country swing dancing at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, the National Museum of Wildlife Art \nKansas City, Mo. \nStop by Kansas City, Mo., where the city’s lively jazz and art scene and numerous farm-to-table restaurants are sure to dazzle vacationers. The city, which is on the very edge of the path of totality, is expected to experience only about 30 seconds to one minute of totality during the eclipse (the farther north in the city and suburbs you go, the better), but it may prove to be a popular choice for residents between Wyoming and southern Illinois who want to be in the direct path.

(Photo: Steve Buhman) \nCarbondale, Ill.; Hopkinsville, Ky.; Land Between the Lakes \nA certified sweet spot for eclipse watching will be in the area of the country where Illinois meets Kentucky. The following locations are expected to have some of the greatest duration times. \n• Carbondale is close to where the eclipse can be viewed in its greatest duration. Carbondale has already formed an eclipse committee in conjunction with Southern Illinois University to coordinate planning for the expected increase in tourism. The university will host the headlining festivities for the city, including tailgating, live entertainment and activities on the football field at Saluki Stadium. Committee co-chairman Bob Baer said the charge, if any, for these events will be minimal. Volunteers with the Citizen Cate Experiment will also be welcome — Baer, who is the project’s state coordinator, said the goal is to place small telescopes along the eclipse path and equip them with cameras to capture images before, during and after totality. The footage will then be used to create a movie that allows viewers to experience a longer eclipse. Planning for the eclipse festivities will continue over the next two years. eclipse.siu.edu \n• In Hopkinsville, eclipse planning has been years in the making. Hoping to be a hub of family fun, the town is planning a number of signature events, including headline entertainment and a chili cookoff with eclipse-related activities. To appeal to the academic community, the local community college is planning to host guest speakers for a weekend-long series of seminars focused on the science behind eclipses and astronomical topics. Mayor Carter Hendricks said the focus is now on certifying proper viewing areas within the community and working with emergency management teams to secure traffic management volunteers. One small kink to be worked out involves the city’s automatic-sensor lighting system, which flips on in the dark. The city is working with electric companies to ensure they’re not a problem during the eclipse. For those who can’t get enough of space-related events, the county’s Green Man Festival, featuring live entertainment and activities that celebrate the 62nd anniversary of a reported extraterrestrial sighting nearby, is planned for the same weekend. visithopkinsville.com \n• The Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area, which manages over 170,000 acres of forest, wetlands and open lands, is situated between Kentucky and Barkley lakes in Western Kentucky and Tennessee. Home of the Golden Pond Planetarium and Observatory (which is open to the public for regular shows and astronomical viewings), the recreation area is planning activities for visitors who want to experience the eclipse in a natural setting. Activities at Land Between the Lakes include camping, hiking and boating. landbetweenthelakes.us \nNashville \nNashville is the largest U.S. city completely within the path of the eclipse totality, so Music City is going to be the place for your perfect eclipse soundtrack. From the Country Music Hall of Fame to The Listening Room Café, constant entertainment will keep visitors engaged before, during and after the solar eclipse. The Adventure Science Center in Nashville is just beginning to plan events for the eclipse. With an emphasis on education, the center is working on programming that looks at the science behind eclipses and why they happen. Also sure to be a big hit with visitors is the Sudekum Planetarium, where viewings combine the power of an optical star projector that fills the room with more than 6.5 million stars and a high-definition dome system. adventuresci.org , visitmusiccity.com \nHotels: Hutton Hotel, Omni Nashville Hotel, Union Station Restaurants: Little Octopus, Arnold’s Country Kitchen, Pinewood Social Attractions: Bluebird Café, The Johnny Cash Museum, Nashville Farmers Market \nThe Boeing Observatory at the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia should be a popular destination for those who want to learn more about the eclipse. (Photo: Jonathan Sharpe) \nColumbia, S.C. \nStop by Columbia for the last best look at the eclipse before it leaves the country. The South Carolina State Museum is preparing to be the main East Coast viewing spot, with an approximate totality of 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The museum’s observatory features a vintage 1926 Alvan Clark refracting telescope that offers beautiful views and will be open for nightly viewings in the days leading up to the eclipse. The museum is also designing its own solar viewers to hand out to guests prior to the big day. Historians will love this location, too, for its tours of an antique telescope gallery that, according to Tom Falvey, museum director of education, features one of the world’s best collections of early American telescopes. For visitors with a passion for astronomy, Falvey suggests making an appointment to peruse the astronomical texts at the University of South Carolina’s library, which date back to 1540. The museum is also planning to sponsor educational, eclipse-related events in the months leading up to the totality. columbiacvb.com , scmuseum.org/explore/observatory \nHotels: Hilton Columbia Center, Columbia Marriott, Hyatt Place Columbia/Downtown/The Vista Restaurants: Cafe Strudel, Terra, The Southern Belly BBQ Attractions: Riverbanks Zoo Garden, Soda City Market, Columbia Museum of Art \nFind more great articles about NASA in USA TODAY’s special publication, on newsstands now until Oct. 19.
