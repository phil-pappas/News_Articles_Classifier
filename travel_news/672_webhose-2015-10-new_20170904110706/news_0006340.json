USA, 12 October 2015 -- Ted, a 19-year-old boy, was just admitted into a university in New York after the college entrance examination. Yet differing from high school, a university is larger in size and better equipped on the aspects of both the software and hardware facilities. Ted considered changing his means of transportation and he finally decided to purchase an Airwheel electric scooter to serve him after collecting all the information he could find from the internet and from his friends who owned one. At the very beginning, he moved back and forth among those places known as library, dormitory, teaching building and canteen where he had to go on foot every day. In order to save time, he bought himself a bicycle and eventually found out that it was unfortunately energy-consuming. Then he considered changing his means of transportation to meet his expectation and he finally decided to purchase an Airwheel intelligent electric scooter to serve him on the street of the campus after collecting all the information he could find from the internet and the friends who owned one. There were two main reasons why he made up him mind to buy one.First of all, he learned that it was quite easy to control it. An Airwheel self-balancing scooter only requires one to stand on it and try to maintain his balance by the appropriate moving of his body. Anyone who could ride a bicycle could easily learn how to master the techniques needed in the rolling of the scooter. More importantly, an Airwheel intelligent scooter was something newly-produced and publicized. When he was riding this cutting-edged means of commuting, he felt that he was the focus of the other studentsâ€™ attention in the campus and he liked it. Anyone who was pursuing their study in the campus could purchase a scooter as well not only to bring great convenience their life, but also to meet their demand to be eye-catching.
