Getty Images\nCOMMENTARY\nAnd so Major League Baseball’s final four is down, at least until all American League matters are settled, to a final three. The mighty Mets swept away Boston’s once-kindred cousins, the not-quite-ready-for-prime-time Cubs, on Wednesday night.\nDespite a film-thin strand of hope presumably offered by the possiblity of a more competitive 2016 sequel, the Mets’ National League Championship Series victory was as anti-climactic as it was impressive. Their pitching staff’s average fastball velocity by hurlers who don’t answer to, “Yo, Bartolo”: 107.3 miles per hour.\nAll right, maybe that’s a guesstimate more than a truth, but it certainly felt they were throwing that hard. Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard have a lot of innings to go to be considered modern-day heirs apparent to Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman and Nolan Ryan. But they sure can deliver a mesmerizing flashback.\nAs for an epilogue for the 2015 Cubs, so gifted with youth and talent, it’s tempting to suggest that their time will come soon. Maybe it will. Perhaps that paragraph of similarities to the 2003-04 Red Sox will be punctuated with a redemptive victory over the Mets next year, much as the ’04 Red Sox vanquished all ghosts against a certain other New York team. Then again, they are the Cubs. Wrigley is a place where even the most promising plans can go awry. For now, if hopefully not for the future, the refrain remains: Woe Cubs woe.\nAs someone who spent hours of his childhood devising imaginary trades to get George Brett to the Red Sox (Carney Lansford, Dick Drago and Garry Hancock for Brett? It’s 3 for 1, how could they say no? And, hell yes, you bet I would have made a great sports-radio caller!), I won’t mind if the Royals emerge from the AL scrum. But I’m hoping it’s the Blue Jays, mostly for the irresistible baseball aesthetics that a matchup between the Mets’ power arms versus the Jays’ power hitters would provide. Imagine Jose Bautista’s bat flip if he got all of, say, a Matt Harvey heater.\nStuff like that is why we watch. Around here, that is especially true, since we have not had a rooting interest in the postseason since October 2013, a two-year void that feels like about a dozen years given that the Red Sox followed up their most recent championship with consecutive and mostly suspense-free last-place finishes.\nIt’s easy enough to rustle up a rooting interest when the Red Sox are not involved. The Cubs, for apparent reasons, had been the consensus choice around here this fall. There’s also another—and probably familiar—way to watch, and that’s through a Red Sox prism. How can the Red Sox learn from the successes of these teams?\nA lesson applicable to future success can be taken from each team in that final four. From the Cubs, it’s putting faith in outstanding young talent. (Cynically, the value of having Jon Lester on your pitching staff is another takeaway.) From the Royals, it’s having patience with that young talent. From the Mets, it’s the value of accumulating young, power arms. From the Jays, it’s proof that acquiring established stars sometimes is the right way to go, so long as the right stars are targeted.\nThere’s also an element of envy, but it is accompanied by reasons for hope for the Red Sox’ immediate future.\nConsider this hypothetical: If you could swipe one player off any of the final four teams’ rosters (yes, we’re still counting the Cubs) and assign him to the Red Sox—just outright steal the guy—who would you take?\n(Don’t say Daniel Murphy, please. If the Todd Walker of his time averages a homer per game in the World Series, then we’ll talk.)\nThe obvious answer is probably Kris Bryant, the Cubs’ 23-year-old slugging third baseman. He could become a decent facsimile of Mike Schmidt, though it should be noted that even in his youth, Schmidt never whiffed as many times in a season as Bryant did this year (199).\nWhile acknowledging Bryant’s promise, value and appeal, let’s also note that the Red Sox have two players who not only have a similarly bright future, but who are established standouts already—and are both younger than Bryant. I’d say it bodes well for the Red Sox that no young player remaining in this postseason—perhaps even no player, period—has much going for him as either Xander Bogaerts or Mookie Betts.\nOf course, if we’re considering need in our Steal That Guy game, the Red Sox could use a young arm or three, and so any of the Mets’ three young aces would do just fine if you want to go that route. I’ll hear arguments in favor of Marcus Stroman as well. Jorge Soler looks primed for a ’16 breakout. And there are veteran standouts all around—Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, Yoenis Cespedes, whom they once had, and David Price, whom they may have if Dave Dombrowski, Boston’s president of baseball operations, is allowed to throw $200,000,000 million his way, give or take $10 million.\nGiven Dombrowski’s long history of wheeling and dealing, perhaps some players we’re watching now will come to Boston eventually. At the least, it’s a fun game to play in these Octobers when the Red Sox have no games to play.\nChad Finn can be reached at finn@globe.com .
