Long before air travel or island vacation cruises, passengers traveled between the United States and Europe by ship. And they still do. 89 Transatlantic cruises are scheduled in 2016. The spring and fall are peak seasons for Transatlantic cruises, as ships move between their winter home in the Caribbean to their summer home in Europe. 28 cruises are available from the US to Europe in April and May. 35 voyages are offered from Europe back to the US in September, October and November.\nCunard Line's luxurious Queen Mary 2 ship provides the only regularly scheduled Atlantic crossings throughout the year. It will make 11 cruises from New York to Southampton (England) in 2016, and 12 in the other direction from Southampton to New York. Highlights of a Queen Mary 2 Transatlantic cruise include relaxing in the spa, dancing in the grand ballroom, playing on one of the sports decks, learning from enrichment programs, and savoring fine food.\nIn the spring, cruises are available from Florida to Rome, Barcelona, Nice, Lisbon, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Berlin, and England. They are from 13 to 18 days long and include often stops at Atlantic islands like the Azores or Madeira, as well as ports in Europe before reaching the final destination. Miami and Fort Lauderdale are the major departure ports, but a few cruises leave from Tampa and Port Canaveral too.\nA good example of an itinerary is the April 15, 2016 Transatlantic cruise on Celebrity Cruise Line. The 14-night one-way cruise departs from Fort Lauderdale and ends in Barcelona, Spain. Ports of call include Ponta Delgada, Azores; Lisbon, Portugal; Cadiz, Spain; Malaga, Spain; and Alicante, Spain.\nIn addition to Celebrity and Cunard, cruise lines offering Atlantic crossings include Crystal Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, Princess Cruises, Royal Caribbean, Silversea, and Star Clippers.\nFor more information and the complete 2016 calendar of Transatlantic cruises, visit http://www.cruisetransatlantic.com/cruises.html#2016\nAbout Cruise Transatlantic\nCruise Transatlantic is part of the Cruise Guide Network group of travel information websites.
