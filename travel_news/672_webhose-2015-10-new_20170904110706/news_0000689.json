Catch and release the fish, but savor the memories for a lifetime.\nHere are five beautiful places to cast a line:\n1. Jackson Hole, Wyo. For an extraordinary angling experience, consider an overnight trip on the South Fork of the Snake River. On Day One, you’ll hone your skills floating through some of the most coveted water in the western United States. Later, as the sun sets, arrive at the South Fork Hilton, a fully outfitted camp tucked in the pines with a steep canyon wall as backdrop. The overnight includes a deluxe dinner, tall tales and roasted marshmallows around a campfire, and a good night’s rest in cozy platform tents.\nThe second day promises stunning scenery, 16 miles of braided waters and the opportunity to expand the adventure wading around gravel bars and up side channels. The trip is ideal for a family reunion.\nContact: worldcastanglers.com ; wyomingtourism.org\n2. Craig, Mont. The Missouri River is arguably the most productive trout fishery in the West. Formed by the confluence of the Gallatin, Jefferson and Madison rivers at Three Forks, the mighty Missouri flows 700 miles across Montana. The small town of Craig is among the numerous launch points from which families explore this storied river. Expect a stunning landscape, trophy trout and the opportunity to imagine Lewis and Clark navigating the same waters.\nContact: visitmt.com ; crosscurrents.com ; headhuntersflyshop.com\n3. Sun Valley, Idaho. This mountain town is perhaps best-known for its famous ski slopes. But the region’s gold-medal waters make for yet another reason to nudge Sun Valley higher on your family vacation list. You’ll be on the hunt for rainbow, brown, brook and cutthroat trout on Silver Creek, the Big Lost and the Wood rivers as well as in pristine mountain lakes.\nTap into the town’s vibrant cultural scene or strap on skates for a whirl around the ice rink at the famed Sun Valley Lodge.\nContact: visitsunvalley.com ; silver-creek.com\n4. Steamboat Springs, Colo. An outdoor-lover’s paradise, Steamboat offers family fly-fishing opportunities on the Yampa River. Spend the morning testing a few trout-rich holes before taking the remainder of the day to bike or explore the historic Western enclave. Ask a local guide to lead the way for a multisport adventure, combining a short hike with the opportunity to cast a line into the pristine streams, lakes and reservoirs that dot the region.\nContact: steamboatflyfisher.com ; steamboatchamber.org\n5. Wellston, Mich. Introduce your family to the joys of fly-fishing in the north woods of Michigan. The scenic and diverse Au Sable River originates north of Grayling and winds for more than 100 miles before meeting Lake Huron.\nA fly-fishing only section of the river flows past Burton’s Landing and is known as the “Holy Water” for its productive riffles and trout-filled pools.
