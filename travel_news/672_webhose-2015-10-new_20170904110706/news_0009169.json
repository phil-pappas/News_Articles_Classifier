Photo: Russell Yip, The Chronicle 10 reasons to visit Napa Valley now 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nLook past the “world class” moniker and you’ll find the less exclusive Napa Valley that the Bay Area knows and loves. We put together a list of things to do and places to visit now through the end of the year that capture the essence of this spectacular destination. \n1. Napa Valley Film Festival \nThis five-day festival is a must for film buffs, as it offers 125 independent films viewed at 12 screening venues throughout the valley. Passes sell out quickly, but there are still ways to catch a film or be a part of the fun. Rush tickets ($15), available at the door, are an affordable option, and the best chance of grabbing one of these open seats is to queue up an hour ahead of time at one of the larger venues like the Uptown or Lincoln Theater. Check the website for other events like day access to the River Promenade ($50) and “Bottle Shock the Musical.” Nov. 11-15. Venues throughout Napa Valley, (707) 226-7500. www.napavalleyfilmfest.org. \n2. Shakespeare performances \nCheaper than a flight to London, NapaShakes offers up two doses of Shakespeare in one week. On Nov. 8, St. Helena’s Cameo Cinema will be screening “Macbeth,” a performance by Shakespeare’s Globe Theater of London. Later in the week, a touring troupe makes one of two North America stops at the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone to perform “Much Ado About Nothing.” It’s an intimate performance in the beautiful Barrel Room. Only four performances, and Sunday’s includes a meet-and-greet with the actors. Nov. 8, 2:30 p.m., Cameo Cinema, 1340 Main St., St. Helena, tickets online only, $20, www.cameocinema.com. Nov. 13-15, Greystone, 2555 Main St., St. Helena, tickets $65, (707) 967-1100. www.napashakes.org/tickets. \n3. Holiday fair \nThe Gifts ’n Tyme Holiday Faire, a local favorite, highlights more than 85 local and regional artists and provides a great shopping alternative to some of the valley’s pricey gift shops. Items include artwork, crafts and locally made goodies like chocolates and condiments. Expect a friendly and down-home Napa vibe. 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Nov. 20-22, Napa Valley Expo, 575 Third St., Napa. Free . \n4. Napa Art Walk \nThanks to the city of Napa and the city’s Arts Council, visitors have large-scale art pieces to view while shopping and dining downtown. Though not all of the remnants of the earthquake are gone, this two-year installation of juried sculpture adds color and interest to this historic area. It features 15 works of abstract and conceptual art from artists all over the West. Pick up a map at the Napa Valley Official Welcome Center to see where they are located. 600 Main St., Napa, (707) 251-5895. Visit www.napaartwalk.org to download a free podcast on the pieces . \n5. Wine tasting card \nNapa Valley wine tasting couldn’t be easier (or more walkable) with a downtown wine tasting card. For $30, guests can sample from 12 tasting rooms. It’s an inexpensive and hassle-free way to taste some of the valley’s more popular wines as well as some hidden gems. Order online or purchase at the Napa Tourist Information Center. Cards are good through the end of December. Napa Tourist Information Center, 1331 First St., Napa. (707) 257-0322, www.donapa.com. \n6. Napa Truffle Festival \nIt makes sense that Napa Valley is one of the few travel destinations that can support a truffle festival. From Jan. 15-18, the Westin Verasa Napa is once again hosting this annual event. For the uninitiated and truffle curious, the festival’s free Marketplace at Oxbow Market, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Jan. 19, is a great way to explore truffles in food and cocktails prepared by Oxbow’s vendors. Look for chef demos, wine pairings and truffle-focused food gifts. Oxbow Market, 610 and 644 First St., Napa. www.napatrufflefestival.com. \n7. Explore Alston Park \nThe valley has lots of open spaces to wander, hike and bike, and Alston Park is a favorite for residents, as it offers lots of different views and dirt trails within its 157 acres. Parts of the trail run through an old plum orchard, and winter is a great time to enjoy blossoms. Other parts of the park include an off-leash dog area. It’s a relatively easy 3-mile loop, just long enough to work off a bit of wine or gustatory indulgence. There’s a picnic area at the top of the moderate climb, offering views of the valley. 2099 Dry Creek Road, Napa. (707) 257-9529, www.naparec.com. \n8. Port tasting \nFortified-wine fans have a few options in the valley, two being in St. Helena. Just off Highway 29, tucked away on Lewelling Lane, is the small, family-run Prager Winery and Port Works. Sample four wines and Ports for $20 and take home the collectible tasting glass. No appointment needed here. Visitors at Charbay Distillery need to call ahead or notify online, but once you reach the top of the winding Spring Mountain Road, you’ll sample six pours for $20, which includes wine and a couple of their Ports and a green tea aperitif. As one of a few U.S. wineries that distills its own brandy to create its ports and aperitifs, Charbay is a unique tasting experience (even if the law limits the tasting room to wine-based bottles). Both provide a chance to pick up a bottle (or six) for holiday gifts. Prager Winery and Port Works, 1281 Lewelling Lane, St. Helena. (707) 963-7678, www.pragerport.com; Charbay Distillery and Winery, 4001 Spring Mountain Road, St. Helena. (707) 963-9327, www.charbay.com. \n9. Sunset and burger \nat Auberge du Soleil \nIf you’re looking for an elevated version of a burger and fries, look no further than Auberge du Soleil’s Bistro and Bar, where you can enjoy stellar food with a killer view. Fall is the perfect time to snag a coveted table on the wraparound terrace since it’s still just warm enough to wait for the sunset. The burger might set you back $20, but the views off the deck of this spectacular resort are free. Serving from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. No reservations. 180 Rutherford Hill Road, Rutherford. (707) 963-1211, www.aubergebistro.com. \n10. Seasonal cocktail \nat Ninebark \nNapa’s restaurant scene has been abuzz since word got out that Michelin two-star chef Matt Lightner and restaurant design firm AvroKO would be remodeling and taking over the Thomas and Fagiani’s Bar. The space’s piece de resistance for cocktail fans is the third-floor open-air lounge where complex cocktails are served with pared-down dishes from the second-floor dining room. Though lofty cocktails like Panache Indochine (IPA, gin, whole pressed lemon, ginger, kaffir lime) cost $15 (or more), you won’t have to wait a month or longer to taste Lightner’s food and Andrew Salazar’s drinks. 5:30-11 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday, 813 Main St., Napa. (707) 226-7821, www.ninebark-napa.com. \nSophia Markoulakis is a freelance writer.
