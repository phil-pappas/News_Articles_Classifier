(AP) — The sound of voices in synch filled the air as two of country music's greatest vocal harmony groups, the Oak Ridge Boys and the Browns, along with the late gifted guitarist Grady Martin were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday night.\nOn hand to honor the 2015 inductees were Garth Brooks , Trisha Yearwood , Dierks Bentley , Vince Gill and Marty Stuart with performances of hits like \"Elvira,\" ''The Three Bells\" and \"El Paso.\"\nThe four members of the Oak Ridge Boys, Joe Bonsall , Duane Allen , William Lee Golden and Richard Sterban, each received a medallion from their longtime friend and tour mate, Kenny Rogers .\nBrooks, who is nominated for entertainer of the year at the Country Music Association Awards next month, said the Oak Ridge Boys gave him his start as a young artist in the 1980s.\n\"So they opened the doors for me, but what they really did, long before that — 'Y'all Come Back Saloon,' might be one of the greatest albums ever recorded in country music history,\" Brooks said before the ceremony. \"Great song after song, hit after hit.\"\nThe four newest members of the hall have all been performing together since 1973, although the band's origins date back to the 1940s. They are one of the few gospel acts to successfully transition to secular music and become hit-makers in multiple genres.\n___\nPolice patrols increase after Nashville campus shooting NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Metro Nashville Police have begun increased foot patrols at Tennessee State University in the wake of a fatal shooting during an on-campus fight.\nA university statement says three walking teams of two officers each began patrols Friday night. The patrols focused on residence halls and the inner campus area, which includes the student courtyard where last week's fatal shooting took place. Metro police also plan to increase visibility of officers beginning this week.\nPolice have said 19-year-old Cameron Selmon of Memphis was killed in the shooting. He was not a student at TSU.\nTwo female students who were wounded were released from Vanderbilt University Medical Center on Friday. A third female student was grazed but not hospitalized.\nPolice are still searching for the person responsible for the shootings.\n___\nLawmakers work together to boost number of teen voters NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Two lawmakers from Nashville are working together to encourage more teens to register to vote.\nThe Tennessean () reports Republican state Sen. Steve Dickerson and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper are working with the Davidson County Election Commission to raise awareness of a program that allows 17-year-old high school students to register to vote, though they have to wait until they are 18 to cast a ballot.\nLast year, about 15 percent of eligible high school students registered. Dickerson and Cooper say they hope next year's presidential elections will help boost the number to at least 30 percent.\nTotals for recent Metro elections show that 70 percent of those who voted were over the age of 50; only 2 percent were under the age of 25.\nThe Davidson election commission plans a voter registration drive at high schools Jan. 25-28, 2016.\n___\n___\nSearch on for man accused of shooting at police in 2 states LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Police were searching Sunday for a man accused of shooting and injuring a Tennessee police officer, and then firing at state troopers in Kentucky, officials said.\nKentucky State Police spokesman Billy Gregory said several law enforcement agencies are searching for Floyd Ray Cook , who fled into hilly, wooded countryside along the border of the two states.\nPutnam County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Beth Nelson said Officer Ahscari Valencia of the Algood Police Department in Tennessee pulled Cook over on Saturday. When he asked Cook to show his hands, the suspect shot him. Nelson said Valencia, who has been an officer with the department for 1 ½ years, was wearing a bulletproof vest, which saved his life.\nShe declined to release what initiated the traffic stop due to the ongoing investigation.\nGregory said Kentucky troopers later found a vehicle about 5 miles south of Burksville, Kentucky, matching the description in the Tennessee shooting and pulled it over. He said the man inside exited and shot at troopers, who returned fire. The troopers weren't injured. He said it wasn't clear whether the suspect was injured.\nGregory said officials called off Saturday's search after dark, but resumed Sunday morning at daybreak. He said officers are searching by foot and with K9s, in addition to having a couple of roadblocks set up to check vehicles in the area.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:47:01.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
