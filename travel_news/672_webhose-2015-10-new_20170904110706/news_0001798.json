The announcement was made on Wednesday at IMEX America, Las Vegas. Vice President of Melia Hotels International, Meetings & Events, John was heralded as being ‘a huge supporter of the incentive travel industry’ and someone who is ‘very generous with his time outside of his role with Melia Hotels, especially when it comes to the SITE foundation.’ \nHis importance to SITE was underlined in 2013 when he was named their Global Member of the Year. Another of his nominators described him as ‘one of the most accomplished professionals on the incentive travel scene - a guy who has seen and done it all.’ Commenting on this award, Aoife Delaney, Ovation’s Director of Global Sales and VP of Finance for SITE, said: “John joins an illustrious list of past Huggability Award winners and it’s easy to see why. The Ovation Huggability Award has traditionally gone to individuals who are recognised as icons within the MICE space – John certainly fits the bill. In February, he welcomed his SITE colleagues to Melia’s Dubai property and I was blown away by his professionalism and warm welcome. Ovation Bear will have a great year hanging out with John and his team.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:59:36.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
