Mercury News • Sunday October 18, 2015 5:00 AM \n\"Oh, my God, look at that!” \nMy wife, Sara, and I have just driven around one of those hip-hugging turns on Highway 1 in California’s Big Sur region. They used to make me nervous — the fact that there’s nothing but a guardrail between me and the death-fall. Now they make me greedy for what I know is coming: a straight-shot view down miles of coastline, the jutting cliffs, the shining sea below. \nWe’ve been visiting here for more than 25 years. Now our three sons have grown and flown, and we’re simply getting away, heading to Ventana Inn & Spa, the resort founded by Hollywood investor Larry Spector. \nWe intend to earn the pampering, however, by hiking a steep trail up into the Santa Lucia coastal range. The trek requires fortification, and so we precede our Big Sur adventure with a stop at a foodie paradise known as the Big Sur Bakery and Restaurant. 11 a.m.: The sandwich \nThe bakery is in a converted ranch house built in 1936 by a descendant of William Brainard Post, the 19th-century pioneer who worked at a Point Lobos whaling station before moving to Big Sur as a ranch foreman. He married Anselma Onesimo, who was of Costanoan Indian heritage, and their family became famous on this twisty stretch of coast. All that history adds to the bakery’s rustic ambience, but I’m not prepared for the cost of our little meal: $41 for two coffees, a ham-and-cheese croissant and a couple of sandwiches to go? \nBut the coffee is rich, the croissant is, like, ridiculous. And when we get into the car and begin the drive toward our trailhead, Sara and I are groaning, literally, as we pass Sandwich No. 1 back and forth. It’s overstuffed with curling ribbons of fresh Italian meats — ham, salami and mortadella — spilling out of the perfect, crusty sourdough. \nAnd now we are ready for the Ewoldsen Trail. Noon: The hike \nLeaving the trailhead — alongside the parking lot in Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park — we follow a babbling creek, hopping across rocks and roots, then begin our climb. \nThe trail slants steadily up, switchbacking through redwood groves, cleaving to the sides of McWay Canyon, passing over small wooden bridges and breaking into dramatic cloud-shrouded views of the Pacific. The silence is profound. Dotting our way are redwood sorrel and wild sweet pea with pale lavender blossoms. \nAt the 90-minute mark — about halfway through the 4.6-mile loop — we come to a fork, with a sign pointing up toward the Waters Trail. We climb another 100 yards or so, hang a left and plunk ourselves down on a bench marked with a rickety “End of Trail” sign. More than 1,000 feet above the ocean, we are practically at cliff’s edge. It feels like the top of the world. 4 p.m.: Happy hour \nThe decadence begins at Ventana. We sip two glasses of excellent pinot and dig into the spread of cheeses. Guests wander about in white robes, fresh from massages and hot tubs. We speak in undertones, as do all the other couples. \nWe take refills on the pino and amble along the winding, wooded pathways back to our room, where we munch grapes in front of the fire, then grab a blanket and flop, slightly tipsy, into the hammock out on the deck, enveloped by forest. 7:30 p.m.: Dinner \nThe Restaurant at Ventana is a sleek and intimate place, softly lit. My four-course meal ($75) includes a grilled New York strip steak with hen of the woods mushrooms and other accouterments, a mingling of flavors that demands slow eating. Sara is silenced by her roasted duck breast; that’s how good it is. \nWe linger for three hours over the meal, drinking good red wine, overindulging in dessert. And then we stroll back to our room, don our robes and — laughing in the dark — find our way to the Japanese bathhouse, where we slide into the warm waters and stare up at the sky, naming the constellations, counting our good luck. 10 a.m.: One more hike \nA storm is coming in the next morning, but trail guide Greg Ambrosio is ready to lead his daily tour of the Ventana property: 243 acres, a mere corner of the surrounding Ventana Wilderness, which is 165,000 acres large. \nBefore long, Ambrosio is pointing out tracks in the earth: bobcat, rabbit, wild turkey, deer. He takes us to a secluded redwood grove: Native Americans treated it as a sacred spot; some people call it an energy vortex. \nLooping the property, Ambrosio seems familiar with each blossom and tree. He snaps off fragrant sprigs of white sage, yerba buena and pennyroyal. He picks a leaf of California bay laurel, snaps it in half and offers us a whiff of the menthol aroma. \nHe offers to take us several miles down the road to a spot with 15 waterfalls. But now the wind is picking up, the rains getting ready to wallop. Fifteen waterfalls? We’ll be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:35:53.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
