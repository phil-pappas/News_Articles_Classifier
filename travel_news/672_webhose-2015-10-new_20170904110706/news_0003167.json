Joe's primary responsibility will be to represent the Vantage product to new and existing dealer partners as well as their clients. \nJoe has spent the last 7 years with N. Glantz & Son, where he gained his experience and knowledge in the sign industry, spending most of his career in sales. He has experience in many aspects of the industry, including EMC's, LED sign lighting, outdoor LED lighting, dynamic digital signage, adhesives, extrusion, substrates, wide format digital printing, and more. \nLupton stated, \"I have a need to understand the technical intricacies in anything I do and began digging in to learn as much as possible. As I did this, it became apparent that in the sign world not everyone is as excited about the details as I am, and that has been the key to my success.\" \nJoe grew up on the east coast in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia spending most of his high school years playing music. He toured in a rock band for 5 years and toured with a gospel group for about a year enjoying the road and making enough money to eat. It wasn’t until he joined N. Glantz & Son that he discovered the sign industry and quickly found an affinity for digital advertising . \nHe continued, \"Videos and moving images are the most efficient way of communication, and I believe it everyone’s favorite way to consume it. It is going to overwhelmingly be the natural solution in the sign industry.\" \n\"The Vantage LED product is genuinely superior to the competition, but that is not the defining factor, it’s the team that stands behind the product that is the game changer. The product is what I call \"signguy friendly\" with user friendly software and thoughtful product design. I am proud to represent the product and work alongside the team at Vantage.\" \nJoe loves spending time with his family, and he definitely admires the family and team vibe that is embedded in the culture at Vantage LED. \nChris Ma, Founder and CEO of Vantage, stated, \"Joe is an individual who pays close attention to the details; not only about our product, but details about our relationship with dealers and their clients. This level of genuine care is invaluable, and I’m proud to have him on the team.\" \nAbout Vantage LED: \nIn an industry becoming stagnant, Vantage LED, a U.S. Manufacturer of Innovative LED Displays , is forging ahead providing revolutionary digital advertising solutions with innovative hardware and intuitive software featuring internet & mobile access through the SM Infinity ™ platform with integrated professional content creation; all backed by real human support, strong resources, and smart business. #ThisIsVantage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:18:49.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
