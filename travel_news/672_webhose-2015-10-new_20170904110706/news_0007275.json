The NFTSD sponsored campaign asks parents and teens to make a mutual promise to each other during the pre-driving and early driving years.\nResearch is clear that teens whose parents take an active driver education role are involved in fewer and less severe crashes. To enable parents to help their teens become safe and responsible drivers NFTSD is launching \"The Safe Driving Promise,\" a campaign that focuses on the critical role of the parent in their teen's driver education. The campaign will run from October 18 to 24, 2015 in support of National Teen Driver Safety Week.\nThe first part of this mutual promise asks parents to make a commitment to play an active role in helping their teen develop safe driving habits using love, patience, and support, and leading by example. Next, both parent and teen will promise to learn about and abide by their state's graduated driver license law, and pledge to drive sober, drug free, well rested and without distractions, obey the speed limit, and never operate a vehicle until everyone in the car is buckled up.\n\"As parents we often think our influence wanes as our children grow-up.\" said Susan Scarola , Foundation President. \"This is just not true especially when it comes to driving safety. We hope this campaign encourages parents to refocus their efforts in keeping their inexperienced teen drivers safe on the road.\"\nThe campaign also gives students an opportunity to nominate their school to receive one of four grants from NTFTSD. At the campaign's conclusion, NFTSD will award $2,500 grants to each of four randomly selected high schools. These grants are specifically earmarked to support school sponsored safe driving activities.\n\"Learning to drive is an exciting time for teens, but can be a stressful time for parents.\" said Roy Bavaro , Foundation Executive Director. \"Establishing a regular dialogue and enforcing the rules will help keep young drivers safe and can ease some the worries parents have when they finally hand the car keys to their newly licensed teen driver.\"\nFor more information about The Safe Driving Promise go to www.NFTSD.org\nAbout National Foundation for Teen Safe Driving\nEstablished in 2008 as the DCH Teen Safe Driving Program, the National Foundation for Teen Safe Driving is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit charitable organization dedicated to reducing the number of deaths and injuries resulting from automobile crashes by promoting safe driving and passenger safety, through leadership, education and awareness.\nContact:\nRoy Bavaro\n917-628-8786\nRBavaro@nftsd.org\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/national-foundation-for-teen-safe-driving-announces-campaign-and-grant-program-300161163.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
