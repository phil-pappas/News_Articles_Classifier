The exhibition, entitled “Women behind the Pearls”, will feature the stunning creations of ATLAS Pearls and Perfumes, as well as inspiring insight into the lives of the women who created them. It will run from October 1st 2015 till January 10th, 2016.\nFeaturing stunning photographic images, video content and visual displays, the exhibition will be as much about the stories behind the women who created these natural masterpieces as the beauty of the finished products themselves. These women are considered the true “Masters” of the South Sea Pearl. Physical displays of pearl shells, pearling industry tools and finished jewelry designs will add texture and bring the entire process to life. Guests of Conrad Bali will be treated to a glamorous fashion parade on the opening night, which will feature the exhibits in conjunction with the masterpieces of a Balinese designer.\n“This exhibition will reveal not only the elegant women of Balinese pearls, but it will give the guests insight and a connection with the local people who dedicate their lives to producing them,” said Conrad Bali’s General Manager, Frederic Lebegue.\nEstablished in 1992, ATLAS Pearls and Perfumes is a world leader in producing “nature’s most precious gift” the South Sea Pearl, and has five pearl farms extending from North Bali to West Papua. The company’s Bali pearl farm is located in the lush, natural environs of Bali’s north coast.\nLiving Lobby Art Exhibition Series\nThe “Women behind the Pearl” exhibition is the fourth and final of Conrad Bali’s quarterly exhibitions for 2015. The Living Lobby Art Exhibition Master’s Series is an opportunity for our guests and local residents to experience the extraordinary indigenous art of Indonesia while also discovering the heritage and philosophies that underpin Indonesian culture, customs and beliefs.\nSource:- Conrad Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:05:02.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
