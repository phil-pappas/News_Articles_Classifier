Namely, that you lived in a pretty house on a slanted street and said, “You got it, dude” to get a laugh. Then I grew up and actually went myself. And what I discovered thrilled me right back to 1987.\nFirstly, people do live in pretty houses on slanted streets (really slanted streets) and they do say “dude” with alarming regularity. But more notable – especially for my adult self – is that it’s a city that enjoys a sense of humour and a refined palette in equal measure. I was halfway to the Annual Running of the Bison before I realised it was April Fool’s Day and I’d been had by the biggest publication in town. And the food? Well, let me tell you…\nSan Francisco’s elegant Victorian-era houses.

Actually, while you’re Fisherman’s Wharf way, visit the Musée Mécanique with its antique arcade machines – possibly the world’s best ever first-date spot. Hungry again? Muscle in on a table at The Slanted Door in the Ferry Building, where the cellophane noodles with crab are celebrated far and wide.\nFisherman's Wharf in San Francisco - now a gourmet’s delight.

It’s hard to fault this place. The Nob Hill location, the spine-tinglingly high ceilings, the incredibly helpful concierge – it all feels very San Francisco-esque. Bunker down and prepare your digestive tract for day two.\nReady? Good. Head to Tartine Bakery for breakfast. Arrive early to nab some morning buns – pastries made from croissant dough that sell out quicker than Fleetwood Mac concert tickets. For lunch, it’s got to be Mission Chinese Food’s kung pao pastrami. And if you’re a second-lunch aficionado like me, it’s over to Tony’s Pizza Napoletana with you. Owner Tony is an 11-time World Pizza Champion. Credit where credit’s due.\nThe Ferry Building in San Francisco.

With those ticked off, you can get back to the grub. For dinner proper, my favourite is Fog City – a former diner turned linen-napkin joint where devilled eggs, mac and cheese and warm doughnuts are among the toothsome treats. For a post-supper tipple, head to Bourbon & Branch, a speakeasy that requires you to book ahead and gain a password for entry. Have the aforementioned concierge call to secure you the best seat in the house; something they’ll happily do. Exactly the “you got it, dude” attitude that will keep me coming back for more.\nRooms at the Ritz-Carlton start at $572.
