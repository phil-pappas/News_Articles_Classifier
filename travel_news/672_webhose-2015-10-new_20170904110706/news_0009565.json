In a society that increasingly relies upon technology to keep us connected, this can simultaneously cut off further away from the people nearest to us. How? Because everything has gone high-tech . Whole industries have grown up that didn’t exist 10 years ago – take for example social media , and the legions of companies that have branched into online digital marketing, cross-promotion and online media services as a result of the internet’s tight grip on society. And so it is without much surprise that a new survey revels just how many of the older generation are struggling to keep up with their children’s working environments. We spend our lives attached to technology Photo: Alamy According to new research conducted by jobsite Indeed , almost two-thirds (58 per cent) of parents in the UK are unable to describe what their child does for a living. The survey, which asked 1,000 parents with children in full time employment, found that technology is the industry that most millennials are currently employed in, followed closely by IT. This isn’t surprising: a recent report showed that as technology opportunities grow throughout the UK, now 7 per cent of jobs advertised are within this industry. Remember the days when a mobile phone was this big? Photo: Alamy What is surprising, however, is how few parents aged 55 and over know what their child does for a living. According to Indeed’s research, 40 per cent of parents in this age group are unaware of how their child pays the bills, and 16 per cent of parents in the same age group wouldn’t be able to say what industry their child works in. This feeling is reflected down into parents of younger children too: according to this new research, 22 per cent of parents admit to being baffled by the STEM-focused curriculum now in place in schools nationwide. This is how high-tech we used to be Photo: Alamy “Nowadays, every company is becoming a tech company – it’s the reason British schools have rightly added STEM subjects to the curriculum,” said Gerard Murnaghan, VP EMEA of Indeed. “Saying that, the older generation don’t want to get left behind – it’s now possible to take coding and web development courses in most UK cities. Not only will parents have a chance to learn more skills that will likely come in handy when it comes to their own job development, but it’ll certainly help them in understanding their children's’ jobs. Our careers are such an important part of both our own and our children’s lives, so it would be a shame not be able to share experiences, both highs and lows, with those closest to us.” But tell us: how much do you know about your children's lifestyle? telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:41:15.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
