Roberto Ingledew \nSouth America is a continent that has a long and varied history, but when the colonial forces arrived to conquer and control the region, one of the most valuable tools that they brought was religion. \nTo celebrate God, and to show to the indigenous people the beauty and wonder that they believed they were sharing with the people, some of the most beautiful churches in the world were built. \nOver more recent years, South America has become a bastion of the Catholic faith, and some of the most interesting churches of the last century have also been built in South America. The Cathedral of Sao Paolo, Brazil \nThis church was dedicated on the four hundredth anniversary of the founding of Sao Paolo , and is one of the most beautiful churches on the continent, set on an impressive large plot with two rows of palm trees leading to the stunning frontage. \nThe two towers are typical of the Neo-gothic architecture , but a Renaissance dome adds an interesting feature, while the interior has huge pillars and a vaulted ceiling, with some wonderful stained glass windows decorating the building. Basilica of the National Vow, Ecuador \nThe ornate exterior of this wonderful Basilica in Quito is truly beautiful, with some amazing carvings and the interesting twin clocks that are located in the large towers. \nYou will see some stones that were donated by believers along with donations to the building of the church, that have names engraved on the stone, while the Ecuadorean government had to levy a tax on salt for the population to continue funding the building of the church. Catedral Basilica de Salta, Argentina \nThis basilica is one of the best remaining examples of Baroque church building techniques in South America, and its pink and cream exterior is one of the most attractive in the world, and seems to be a completely different proposition when compared to most stone churches. \nThe interior is equally impressive with large amounts of marble used in the construction, and the altar is almost ostentatious in terms of the volume of golden color used. Las Lajas Sanctuary, Colombia \nBuilt on a stone bridge spanning a river, and with an appearance that is almost otherworldly to the human eye, this church looks like a fairy tale castle nestled between two very steep green slopes. A Gothic revival church, the pinnacle is three hundred and thirty feet above the floor of the canyon, and it is certainly the most popular attraction in the town of Ipiales. Maringa Cathedral, Brazil \nThis is the tallest church in South America, and is certainly one of the most dramatic examples of modern church building in South America, having been completed in 1972. \nThe foundation stone was donated from the Vatican in Rome, while the central cone is impressive from the outside, and has some stunning glass windows that really become visible when you are inside the church. Lima Cathedral, Peru \nThis is one of the original colonial churches to have been built in South America, and was completed in 1538, although there have been several renovations and extensions to the cathedral since then. \nThere are two towers at the front of the church flanking the main entrance, decorated in the neoclassical style, while inside the rows of pillars supporting the roof flank the main path to the altar, which is a very impressive sight. Isluga Church, Chile \nLocated among some of the active volcanoes on the Chilean altiplano, this small church may not be ornately decorated, but its simple white walls and the small bell tower are an interesting sight to be seen in this remote part of the country. \nThe surroundings are beautiful, and with no ambient light in the area, it is often used as a subject in night time pictures, when there are thousands of stars visible.
