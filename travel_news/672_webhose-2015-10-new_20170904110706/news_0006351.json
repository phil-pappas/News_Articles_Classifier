But digging deeper reveals that there are other concerns, too. Besides grumbles about red tape, access to funding and business rates, Britain’s communications and transport infrastructures come in for the heaviest criticism. After the general election in May, the Institute of Directors canvassed its members on Britain’s biggest barriers to doing business. The main obstacle was the UK’s poor national broadband coverage. It is no good running your business through the cloud if you cannot transfer data because your broadband is too slow Graeme Purdy, chief executive of Ilika plc, which designs hi-tech solid-state batteries, would agree. He finds slow broadband on the train from Ilika’s base in Southampton to London a regular irritation. “It is as slow as rock erosion,” he laments. Not that a faster broadband connection would solve everything. Mr Purdy says “overcrowding on commuter trains makes it difficult to get a seat”, and, with large holes in 3G coverage on the line, working on the move becomes nearly impossible. Ilika’s challenges are exacerbated by various infrastructure works proceeding at glacial speed. “On the M27, works at Junction 3 have taken nine months,” says Mr Purdy. “On the M3, the smart motorway improvement from junctions 2 to 4a is taking two years.” For Ian Newcombe, chief executive of Sanderson Group plc, a Coventry-based AIM-listed software provider to SMEs, the patchy communications infrastructure is a major hindrance. “Lack of broadband in rural areas is a barrier to business,” he says. “Uptake of cloud-based solutions is growing, but it is no good running your business through the cloud if you cannot transfer data because your broadband is too slow or non-existent.” Britain’s smaller businesses believe a lack of support from councils and big business is the main barrier to their growth Britain’s next bugbear is no surprise – access to funding. Take TeleWare, a Thirsk-based telecoms software company with turnover of £10.5m and 75 employees. One in three FTSE 100 companies use TeleWare technology but, as Steve Haworth, TeleWare’s chief executive, explains, the big barrier to growth is “availability of funding.” For Mr Haworth, the funding issue has two primary causes. “First, the complexity of government schemes, specifically tax relief options; and second, on access to investment that is no longer widely available.” While a number of government schemes are intended to facilitate growth among SMEs, Mr Haworth says their complexity can be a turn-off for smaller organisations. He cites the Research and Development Relief – a corporation tax relief – for which claiming often involves a huge commitment in time and resources that smaller organisations cannot afford. When it comes to investment, says Mr Haworth, many businesses seem to fall through the gaps. “Venture capital is aimed at small, fast-growing businesses, whereas private equity is aimed at larger companies,” he says. “Historically, the gap between these two has been filled by the banking sector. But since the banking crisis of 2008, this pool has almost disappeared, leaving businesses in the middle with little access to much-needed funding.” • To find out more about how invoice finance can support business growth, visit www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:55:27.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
