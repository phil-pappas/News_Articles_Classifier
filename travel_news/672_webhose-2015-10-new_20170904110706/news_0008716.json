The month of October provides the greatest variety of hawks including Sharp-shinned Hawk, Coopers Hawk, Northern Harrier, American Kestrel, and Red-shouldered Hawk. The Kittatinny Ridge, which runs northeast to southwest on days with northwest winds, provides lift for the hawks on their migration. In this way, the hawks conserve their energy for the long flight. Sunrise Mountain, in Sussex County, New Jersey is located along the Kittatinny Ridge. On Saturday October 17, Peter Wulfhorst, past president of the Gifford Pinchot Audubon Society (GPAS) will be leading a trip to Sunrise Mountain to observe migrating hawks. They will meet at 8:30 a.m. at the Key Food supermarket (former Grand Union) at 501 West Harford Street in Milford to car pool to Sunrise Mountain. They will stay at Sunrise Mountain for the morning and part of the afternoon depending on how many birds are migrating. Please bring a lunch. The field trip is free and open to the public. For more information or to register for the trip, please contact Peter Wulfhorst at 570-296-2244 between the hours of 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. News Eagle - Hawley, PA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:22:17.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
