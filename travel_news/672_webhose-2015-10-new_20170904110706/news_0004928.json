Matt Mauney Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel New Remy's Ratatouille Hide & Squeak at Epcot keeps kids entertained while parents enjoy Food & Fest \nBetween the array of eclectic dishes and beverages, adults are usually easily entertained at the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival. \nThe same can't be said for children, as it's no secret the festival and theme park is geared toward an older crowd. \nEnter Remy's Ratatouille Hide & Squeak, a family-friendly scavenger hunt new to this year's festival. \nThe premise is simple. \nFirst, buy a map and sticker packet ($7.95, plus tax) at one of the following locations inside Epcot: Disney Traders, Festival Center, Pin Central, Port of Entry and World Traveler (International Gateway). Then circle the World Showcase in search of Remy, the star of Disney's \"Ratatouille.\" \nRemy's Ratatouille Hide & Squeak is a scavenger hunt-style game new to this year's Epcot International Food & Wine Festival. \nThe lovable blue rodent can be found in the different sections of the World Showcase with ingredients that correspond to the stickers. \nFind Remy with each ingredient and fill out the map with the stickers respectively. There's a total of 12. \nThe story behind it is that you're helping Remy collect the ingredients for his signature dish, Ratatouille. \nBut lets be honest, you're doing it for the prize. \nThe map can be turned in at Port of Entry (completed or not) to redeem one of six limited release pins, which are copies of the stickers -- Remy with a tomato, a salt shaker, an onion, a green pepper, an eggplant and a bottle of olive oil. Remy's Ratatouille Hide & Squeak pins Walt Disney Co. \nAfter you have a map and sticker sheet, you can return it to Port of Entry at Epcot for one of six limited release pins. \nAfter you have a map and sticker sheet, you can return it to Port of Entry at Epcot for one of six limited release pins. (Walt Disney Co.) \nThe scavenger hunt is a great addition to keep children entertained and engaged while mom and dad explore the food and drinks of the World Showcase. \nMost of the Remys can be found on the festival kiosks, but some are hidden in other parts of the countries. Some are easy to spot, while others are surprisingly camouflaged well, which can make this as fun for adults as it is for children. \nThis isn't a new concept for Epcot. During the Easter season, the theme park has a similar scavenger hunt for over-sized Disney character-themed eggs. \nThe Hide & Squeak pins are subject to availability, as are the maps and sticker sheets. The promotion ends with the festival on Nov. 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:56:20.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
