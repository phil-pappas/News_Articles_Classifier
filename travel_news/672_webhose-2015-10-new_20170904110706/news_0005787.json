The commitment was seen as a sign of support for the project’s Chinese investors, led by China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), the nation’s largest nuclear power plant operator by installed capacity. It may also open opportunities for further deals, such as majority Chinese ownership of Bradwell station in Essex, the Chancellor said. The Hinkley plant, which was still in the planning stage, would be built using the Hualong One reactor, a thirdgeneration Chinese technology. If the plan goes ahead, it will be the first time Chinese technology has been used in a developed country. According to CGN, the technology needs General Design Assessment approval to gain access to the British market. Once the documents are submitted, it could take four to five years for the assessment to be completed. “China and Britain complement each other’s strengths in nuclear capability and this could prove to be a successful long-term partnership\" Adrian Bull, National Nuclear Laboratory. Hualong One, also known as HPR1000, was jointly developed by CGN and China National Nuclear Corp, its partner in the Hinkley project, based on 30 years’ experience in the design, construction and operation of nuclear power plants. CGN engineers have said the technology featured a single reactor layout, double containment and three safeguard trains; is convenient for construction, operation and maintenance, and meets the highest safety standards in the world. The company said it would apply its latest technology to units three and four of the Fangchenggang nuclear power plant in the southern Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region. Construction was expected to begin by the end of this year. Qin Zhijun, a senior official for nuclear power with the State Energy Administration, invited the British government and related companies to visit the demonstration project in April. Going global Chinese nuclear firms have been in discussion with British companies, research centres and organisations to localise their technology for the British market. Talks started with the Hinkley Point project, led by EDF Group, which is largely owned by the French government. Although already in the advanced planning stage, British energy firm Centrica withdrew its 20 per cent stake in the project in 2013 due to delays and escalating cost estimates. EDF and the Chinese nuclear power team, led by CGN, reached an agreement that year that Chinese investors would support the Hinkley Point project as well as become junior partners and investors in a subsequent plant at Sizewell in Suffolk. The French company said it would lead the construction and operation at both sites. In return, EDF would support the Chinese team in the development of a plant on the site of a partially decommissioned nuclear power station in Britain. EDF would be a minority partner and assist the Chinese team through Britain’s approval process for new reactor designs. Britain’s nuclear regulator is one of the strictest in the world and if Chinese firms can pass the assessment they will be in a good position to export to other countries, according to industry observers. Many British nuclear industry supply chain companies have been attempting to increase their involvement in Chinese technology in order to stay part of the Chinese supply chain as the country builds power plants in other developed economies. “China and Britain complement each other’s strengths in nuclear capability and this could prove to be a successful long-term partnership between British and Chinese companies,” said Adrian Bull, director of external relations at the National Nuclear Laboratory. “As the largest growing nuclear power nation, and with experience across the whole fuel cycle, China can create commercial and economic benefits both in China and third markets by working with British firms. “We, along with other British companies, are keen to use our experience and knowledge to support Chinese companies looking to navigate their way through Britain’s regulatory, planning and procurement processes and manage any concerns the public or other stakeholders may have about safety, security and overall public opinion.” CGN’s first nuclear power plant at Daya Bay in southern Guangdong province started commercial operations in 1994. The company has developed into a world-leading clean-energy supplier, supplying nuclear power, solar power, wind power and hydropower. According to the company, as of the end of August, it operated 14 nuclear units with installed capacity of 14.9 gigawatts, making it China’s top business in the field. Another 12 units were also under construction to supply an installed capacity of about 14.4GW, which would make CGN the world’s largest nuclear power station developer. CGN’s installed capacity in the nonnuclear clean-energy sectors also reached about 12.5GW by the end of August. What they say Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK The economic potential of deepened ties between China and Britain provides a key focus for President Xi Jinping’s state visit. China presents significant opportunities for Britain’s financial services industry and related sectors to assist in addressing the challenges of one of the world’s most important economies. It’s equally clear that Britain welcomes Chinese engagement in its economy, either in the shape of investment, RMB trading, bond issuance or listings on the London Stock Exchange. TheCityUK has a programme of work with China that draws on our members’ experience in areas such as the development of free trade zones, infrastructure, and international trade and investment negotiations. I look forward to a productive visit. Stephen Phillips, chief executive at the China-Britain Business Council The president’s visit is much anticipated and will mark a new high point in Britain-China relations, which are going from strength to strength. The visit is an opportunity to deepen commercial ties and to do more business in Britain, China and in third markets. We think there is great potential for continued growth in commercial links. Discussion will no doubt touch on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which will see new opportunities emerge both in China and beyond, with revitalised trade and investment links through Central Asia and on to Europe. Made in China 2025, another important policy that aims to move China’s manufacturing up the value chain, will also open up new areas of collaboration. Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford China Centre Britain can learn from the financial and governmental support China gives its higher education sector, and in the longer term there is a great deal Britain’s higher education sector can bring to China. Despite financial troubles over the past decade, Britain continues to host more top-class universities proportionate to its size than any other major country. This is not accidental. One key reason is that the sector has traditionally nurtured a fierce and openly independent attitude towards research and teaching. Statistics, surveys and insights from British universities are sometimes embarrassing to the governments that pay for them, revealing uncomfortable truths. That is just as it should be in a society where educators have a duty to speak truth to power. Dr Gerard Lyons, chief economic advisor to London Mayor Boris Johnson The state visit is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the countries’ current relations and focus on future areas of potential success. I would like the UK-China Summit to prove an important milestone in cementing a sustainable long-term business, trading and financial relationship. It needs to ensure a level playing field and maximum opportunities for British firms investing in China as its service sector grows. There are also many ways both countries can work together on the global agenda to help improve governance and living standards. With China set to assume the presidency of the G20 next year, there are many possible options, including the environmental agenda.
