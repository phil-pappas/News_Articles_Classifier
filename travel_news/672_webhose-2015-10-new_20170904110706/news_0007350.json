(Photo by Thiti Wannamontha) - + Sec 44: Samui sees no benefit The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has set an ambitious goal of boosting domestic tourism and generating 1 trillion baht in tourism revenue annually three years from now. \n\"If we can encourage Thais to travel more in Thailand, domestic tourism will grow and we can reduce the risks from the foreign tourist market,\" governor Yuthasak Supasorn said. \nForeign tourist arrivals depend mainly on the global economic situation -- if the economy in their homeland is not good, they will travel less and spend less. \nThe TAT has revised down this year's revenue target for domestic tourism to 750 billion baht from 800 billion due to the local economic slowdown. \nIt expects domestic tourism revenue will increase to 802 billion baht next year. \nDomestic tourism revenue is projected to grow by 20% in both 2017 and 2018 before exceeding 1 trillion baht in 2018. \nWhen Thais travel to more tourist destinations, the local economy will expand as well \nFor example, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, one of the TAT's 12 Hidden Gems, saw its tourism revenue grow by 41% in July and its economy improve significantly. \nMr Yuthasak said the TAT would try to increase the length of stay from two nights for Thai travellers. \nCurrently, average spending per head is 1,200 baht a day. \n\"If Thai tourists stayed one day more from their average, spending per trip would reach 3,600 baht,\" Mr Yuthasak said. \nThe TAT also plans to revise its 6.7-billion-baht budget for fiscal 2016, which started on Oct 1. \nHowever, details about the budget allocation adjustment were not disclosed. \nIn previous years, 60% of the budget went to promote Thailand in international markets and 40% for local tourism. \nThe tourism industry currently relies mainly on Chinese tourists, whose numbers are expected to reach 7.4 million this year. \nIf this figure is achieved, the number of Chinese tourists will surge 166% from 2012. \nThe TAT remains optimistic that Chinese tourist arrivals next year will grow by 6.6%, generating revenue of 401 billion baht.   0 people liked / 7  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:34:27.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
