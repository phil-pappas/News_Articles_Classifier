It also asked customers to use airport kiosks to print boarding passes and tags for luggage.\nAt Los Angeles International Airport earlier in the day, several dozen people crowded the Southwest terminal waiting to be issued hand-written tickets. By late afternoon, Southwest said about 450 of the 3,600 flights scheduled for the day had been delayed.\nE.J. Schultz, a reporter for Ad Age who was taking a Southwest flight from Chicago’s Midway Airport, said the airline was telling people at the gate that travelers with paper boarding passes were fine. But those who had downloaded their passes onto their mobile phones were told they had to stand in line, he said.\nSchultz said he didn’t understand why Southwest didn’t announce that people should print out their boarding passes at home before getting to the airport.\n“If everyone had done that, it would’ve saved so much time,” he said.\nIn a statement, Southwest said it was still having “intermittent” technical issues on its website, mobile app and in its phone centers and airport check-in systems.\nThe airline did not say what caused the problem or how long it was expected to last.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:23:47.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
