The multi-year contract recognises the reputation that AJW has forged in the Brazilian marketplace and the Company’s willingness to be flexible and support start-up airlines with their alignment of operational costs.\n“This strategic partnership is AJW’s first PBH contract in Brazil and it spearheads the establishment of a local pool of spares with our other airline and MRO partners” reports James Hardman, VP Customer Services – Latin America, at AJW Aviation. “AJW’s ability to scale up the PBH support as Modern Logistics’ fleet develops, and our own focus on transforming aviation efficiency, ensured that we were the obvious choice of support partner. As the relationship develops, we also envisage utilising Modern Logistics to provide services to AJW throughout the region.”\nModern Logistics’ Commercial Manager, Andre Nascimento, says “Our plan is grow up to thirty aircraft including ATRs. The pace of growth will depend on several factors but we should have fifteen aircraft by 2017. We chose AJW because of its structure and technical expertise as well as the high protection levels that are delivered by its 24/7 AOG service. Also important is the fair market value for the parts that we will lease. Modern Logistics will become the pre-eminent cargo operator in Brazil where there is little competition. We serve and support a needy market where dangerous and special goods need to be transported by air due to poor road system.”\nThis contract with Modern Logistics is further proof that AJW’s policy to ring the globe with strategic hubs of commercial Airbus and Boeing spares in support of specific power-by-the-hour contracts, is vital to sustain the Company’s award-winning 24/7/365 AOG service. AJW currently supports 69% of global fleet operators with appropriate Airbus and Boeing aircraft types and this is fully underpinned by AJW Technique, the organisation’s component repair and overhaul facility in Montreal that is focused on streamlining processes to minimise turn-times and further guarantee dispatch reliability.\nAJW’s new contract with Modern Logistics underlines the outstanding value for money and excellent customer service that is embodied within a power-by-the-hour agreement. AJW now has a global fleet of over 1,000 aircraft under contract providing wide and flexible component coverage, expert advice and recommendations on minimising home base stock requirements, and world class logistics. Serving a global customer base of more than 1,000 airlines in 115 different countries, AJW is the ideal partner for airlines and MRO organisations requiring fully integrated support solutions to help achieve competitive advantage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:36:26.613+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
