(Cleveland Memory Project) Alison Grant, The Plain Dealer A lot of work preceded linking the steel arch -- driving pilings and building footings for piers on either side of the Cuyahoga River and for roadways leading to the bridge. And there was much work to come -- construction of massive concrete arches on either side of the river and of approaches for streetcars and autos. It was November 1917 before the upper deck opened to cars and pedestrians. Streetcars crossed the lower deck in December.\nCars stream across the Detroit-Superior Bridge. (Cleveland Memory Project) Alison Grant, The Plain Dealer But the joining of the two sides of the swooping 591-foot steel bow over the river was the actual and symbolic high point for the engineering feat that was to become the nation's busiest, and possibly the world's busiest, crossing by the 1930s, according to Beyer's research. Also known as the High Level Bridge because it was built to let river traffic pass below, it stood 96 feet above water and was the first fixed span over the river in downtown Cleveland.\n\"The Detroit-Superior Bridge was the second-most famous historic landmark of Cleveland, following only the Terminal Tower and, in the decade before the tower was built, perhaps it was first,\" said William Barrow, head of special collections at the Michael Schwartz Library\nat Cleveland State University.\n\"Its iconic arch, linking the east and west sides of our famously divided town, is a prominent part of the Cleveland skyline.\"\nBeyer reports that there was a chorus of whistles from the Flats as word spread that the east and west halves of the steel arch had joined.\nCuyahoga County leaders, including County Engineer William Stinchcomb, and officials of the King Bridge Co., which did the steel work, stood by as an American flag was planted on top of the arch, then repaired to the Hotel Statler for a celebratory lunch. Ironworkers departed for a nearby saloon, possibly the current Flat Iron Caf√©, to drink a beer to the accomplishment.\nHere are some other things to know about the bridge, from Beyer's \"History of the Veterans Memorial Bridge\" and other sources:\nIt is 3,112 feet long, including the approaches, linking Detroit Avenue on the west and Superior Avenue on the east. It has 12 concrete arches and one steel arch. King Bridge Co. of Cleveland fabricated all the steel parts for the span over the river at its shop at East 69 th Street and St. Clair Avenue. King's winning bid for the superstructure was $571,875. The arch used 2,500 tons of steel for its trusses and bracing with another 1,750 for the floor system. It originally carried two lanes of traffic in each direction and had sidewalks on each side about 15 feet wide. The lower deck was built to accommodate six streetcar tracks but ultimately carried four. The \"cofferdam\" holding back the water during construction of a pier on the west side of the river ruptured in November 1914, completely flooding the excavation. After failed attempts to fix the problem, engineers devised a way to freeze the river and mud next to the pier, using a portable refrigeration plant. Working five days, the plant created a frozen block 2 feet thick, 4 feet wide and 16 feet high. It was enough to stabilize the area, allowing work to continue. Construction of Span 8 brought the first project fatality, when Glen Barry, 25, of Bedford, fell 60 feet to his death. Two weeks later, a portion of steelwork collapsed, killing one and critically injuring three. Two months later, another worker was killed when a plank fell from above, and shortly after that, another accident killed two more workers. By then, the span had become known to workers as \"Hoodoo Arch\" because of its lethal record. The Detroit-Superior Bridge had streetcar lines on its lower deck from 1917 to 1954. Courtesy of All Aboard Ohio The bridge carried streetcar traffic from 1917 to 1954. The lines were gradually phased out by the predecessor to today's Greater Cleveland RTA, the Cleveland Transit System, in favor of trackless trolleys and buses. Streetcar approaches to the bridge were underground in subway stations. Of the three entrances to the West 25th Street station, one can still be seen at the building housing the Massimo da Milano restaurant. By the door to the former Forest City Savings & Trust Co. is a separate door with the word \"Subway\" visible in stained glass above the door lintel. The station had a circular marble stairway with brass railings and a large rotunda. Entrances for the streetcars were below ground because the plan was to create a bigger subway network throughout downtown that would ease auto congestion. The plans fell through several times. Courtesy of clevelandskyscrapers.com The streetcar era for the bridge and for Cleveland as a whole ended on Jan. 23, 1954, when a car traveled from Public Square across the bridge to West 65 th Street and Bridge Avenue. In a brief experiment, the lower deck was converted to use by cars. But the closeness of support columns inside, the lack of ventilation for exhaust fumes and other safety worries led planners to drop the idea. As traffic increased and the bridge aged, structural deficiencies called for major overhauls, from 1967 to 1969, and again in 1996. The first rehabilitation narrowed sidewalks to 5 feet and used a cantilevering system to add a lane of traffic on each side. On November 11, 1989, Veterans Day, the bridge was renamed the Veterans Memorial Bridge. The arts, music and technology IngenuityFest was held on the lower level of the bridge in 2010 and 2011, a popular staging area but expensive to insure and awkward because most of the bottom deck doesn't have power.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:41:21.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
