The number of retired travelers, old couples, solo senior travelers and the likes are not at all insignificant and the travel and tourism industry should be well versed with their habits to offer the best services.\nIn our quest to figure out the most popular habits among the 50-plus travelers of the world, following are five interesting trends that we have come across:\nWhen do they travel?\nAccording to a survey done by AARP, most of the travelers above 50 years prefer domestic travel during the summer months and tries to unleash their happier sides during the weekends. They generally book a holiday with extended family members. This also focuses on the multigenerational family vacations which saw a 4% rise in 2014. Walt Disney in a report in 2014 revealed that one out of five grandparents are going on a Disney vacation with their grandchildren.\nWhy do they travel?\nGetting away from the regular life and a short trip where the 50-plus travelers can relax are probably the main motivating factors. They travel with medicines, sunglasses and prescriptions to maximize their comfort and relaxation during these vacations.\nMedical Insurance is a must!\nEspecially for the senior citizens, even if they are confident about their orientation while traveling, they are encouraged to buy medical travel insurance. This keeps them free from worries of probably emergency health situations.\nEurope or Cruise!\nThe retired travelers of the world and especially the United States still prefer Europe and other tropical locations when given an option. Additionally, the cruise lines do attract an older set of travelers as well.\nSeeking travel perks\nSenior travelers loves to take advantage of the perks, discounts or any other facilities meant for them, especially those who are 60 and up fall under the senior category.\nAre you a travel service provider working with clients who are aging gracefully? Keep a close watch on these trends and offer itineraries based on these â€“ your clients will love them and will travel to enjoy the sun and breeze with their extended family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:29:50.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
