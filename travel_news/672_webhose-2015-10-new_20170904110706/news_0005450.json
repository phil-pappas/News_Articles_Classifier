Behind rich Rococo shop-fronts and wonderful time-warp interiors one can find some of the most delightfully vintage-packaged goods, soaps in colourful art deco boxes, twinkling sardine tins, retro 1930s packets, exquisitely handmade leather gloves, delicate filigree jewellery, bespoke hats and artisanal candles.\nThe Portuguese capital, renowned for its seafood and custard tarts, is also a burgeoning foodie destination that will surprise even the most well-travelled of gourmands, and this holiday season Executive Chef Pascal Meynard has prepared a selection of gourmet dining offerings, which both family and friends will enjoy at Four Seasons Hotel Ritz Lisbon.\nChristmas Eve Dinner at Varanda Restaurant\nThe classic Christmas Eve Dinner on December 24, which will take place in the Hotel’s sophisticated Varanda Restaurant, will include creative gourmet selections such as seared duck foie gras, roasted blue lobster with black truffles, the traditional codfish – confit with sweet garlic, brandade and clam crystalline – and a delicious braised venison filet with juniper berries. For dessert, Pastry Chef Fabian Nguyen has created exquisite red fruit and hibiscus spheres with fleur de sel and gianduja crispy with yuzu sorbet.\nChristmas Day Brunch\nFriends and family will feel at home in the Hotel’s Grand Ballroom for a sumptuous Christmas Day Buffet Brunch, which will feature a host of different dining options, from salads and casseroles to sushi and seafood stations, with roasted suckling pig, orange sauce and lavender; turbot snacké with crab broth and walnut; and a 12-hour veal confit with chestnuts and girolle mushrooms being some of the highlights of the meat and fish sections.
