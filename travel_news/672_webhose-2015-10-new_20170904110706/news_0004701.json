Originally named Alla Venezia Trionfante (“To Triumphant Venice”) it was renamed Caffé Florian after its original owner, Floriano Francesconi. Being the only café that served women in the 18th century, it was Casanova’s favourite hunting ground, while Lord Byron was another dashing chap known to prop up its bar. It is now a combination of concert hall, art gallery and café. Be prepared to spend a little more than normal for your cup of coffee but, with all this history seeping from the painted wall panels, consider it worth the price. Highlight: Hot chocolate or Caffè Venexiano - coffee, Florian coffee liqueur and whipped cream. Café Central, Vienna First opened in 1876, this grand old coffee house was a meeting place for the likes of Trotsky, Freud and the literary and intellectual circles of the early 20th Century. It was closed in the midst of WWII, in which it was badly damaged, and remained closed for 40 years. It now stands proud again amongst the elite of the coffee world. Highlights: coffee, warm apple strudel and history. Café Verlet, Paris Established in 1880 and perched on the Rue St Honore, Café Verlet is a small, old-fashioned coffee house that specialises in single-bean coffees: you order, then they roast and grind to your specification. Pastries, cakes and salads come from the renowned Stohrer patisserie across the road, and go beautifully with your robust espresso, or you can have house glace fruits if you prefer. Café Verlet has been run by the same family for three generations. Its current owner Éric Duchossoy travels the world searching for quality beans and stocks about 20 varieties at any one time. It’s a connoisseur’s dream. Highlight: Rum baba and a cup of Blue Mountain coffee. Café Reggio, NYC A Greenwich Village stalwart since 1927, Café Reggio purports to have served the first cappuccino in the USA. The original owner reputedly spent the princely sum of $1,000 on importing the machine from Italy. Said machine is still in situ today but, alas, no longer in use. Overstuffed with antiques and paintings dating from the 16th century, memorabilia from the Beat poets and stills from the many movies shot here (think Serpico , Shaft and Inside Llewyn Davis ), it remains an eclectic reminder of a New York now largely gone. Highlight: A couple of chocolate cannoli and a cappuccino, of course. Did you know: Blue Bottle is named after the first-ever coffee house in Vienna Photo: Clay McLachlan Blue Bottle, San Francisco Blue Bottle is a relative newcomer to the coffee scene, but it’s an exciting one. Established by self-confessed “disaffected freelance musician and coffee lunatic” James Freeman in 2002 with the ethos that no customer would ever be served beans that were more than 48 hours outside of the roaster, this smooth and eco-friendly coffee outfit (they do all their roasting in vintage machines and only use compostable filters) now has shops on both US coasts and has expanded as far as Tokyo, where people are known to queue four hours for a taste. Blue Bottle is named after the first-ever coffee house in Vienna. They also keep bees on their HQ roof. It’s all part of the buzz. Highlights: New Orleans Iced Coffee, or a Hayes Valley espresso with a homemade Belgian-style waffle. Fazil Bey, Istanbul Fazil Bey’s Turkish Coffee has been open since 1923 and is renowned as THE place for authentic Turkish coffee in Istanbul. Set amongst the street markets of Kadiköy, this bustling time-worn shop seems to have stood still in time. Its house-roasted beans are brewed in a traditional cevze , a long-handled copper pan, and are served with a delicious square of Turkish delight. Highlight: Turkish coffee or salep — sweet rosewater-scented warm milk. Antico Caffè Greco, Rome Waiters in black tie greet you at the door and usher you into a room of marble-topped tables and red velvet banquettes at this historic Italian establishment on the famous Via dei Condotti. Dating back to 1760, and supposedly named after the Greek who opened it, this was yet another meeting place for the likes of Keats, Byron, Goethe, Wagner and, yet again, that scamp Casanova. He certainly enjoyed his coffee. Highlight: Caffè Corretto and a slice of Torta Della Nonna. Algerian Coffee Stores, London Not a coffee house, but a coffee shop on Old Compton Street in the heart of Soho. Established in 1887 and still going strong, the shop prides itself on its proper dark roasts and excellent range of beans, not to mention its full range of coffee-making accoutrements for all possible methods. I recommend the Mexican high roast beans for a coffee with some oomph. Highlight: grab an espresso and nibble on a chocolate-covered fig.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:55:52.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
