Scotland has been the venue for some of the most dramatic and endearing moments in golf and with each event played in Scotland, new golfing history is made. There is no doubt that when golf fans round the world watch their heroes playing magnificent courses in Scotland it inspires them to learn more and to visit the country for themselves.\n“I look forward to sharing our ideas on such a global forum in Shanghai and to potentially fostering new relationships and partnerships to keep Scotland at the forefront of the game for many more years to come.”\nScotland has enjoyed an almost unprecedented profile on the world stage in recent years thanks to staging of major golf events including The 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, The Open at St Andrews and the Women’s British Open at Turnberry in the space of just 10 months.\nIn just 12 months from The 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, more than 622,000 spectators attended golf events in Scotland with hundreds of millions more watching on TV in 200 territories around the planet.\nFigures from the recently published 2014 Ryder Cup Economic Benefits Study showed that the event supported economic activity of £106m in Scotland while 63 per cent of spectators attended from outwith Scotland. The report also revealed that 68 per cent of visiting spectators expected to return to Scotland for a golf or leisure break within a year.\nFollowing on from 2015, Scotland remains committed to hosting the biggest events in world golf with a number of Major Championships already confirmed for future years including The Open at Royal Troon in 2016 and Carnoustie in 2018,the Senior Open Championship in 2016 and the Ricoh Women’s British Open at Kingsbarns in 2017.\nScotland’s investment in events such as the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open, Aberdeen Asset Management Ladies Scottish Open, SSE Scottish Hydro Challenge and the Prostate Cancer UK Scottish Seniors Open is also confirmed for future years as a legacy from The 2014 Ryder Cup.\nIn addition, Scotland is currently bidding to host The 2019 Solheim Cup at Gleneagles, with a decision expected by the Ladies European Tour at the end of October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:48:04.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
