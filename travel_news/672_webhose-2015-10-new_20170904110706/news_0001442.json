Maybe it’s the ears.\n\nA pack llama named Tristan, with Wallowa Llamas, beds down at Eagle Meadow base camp. (Brian J. Cantwell / The Seattle Times) Into the Oregon Alps We accompanied seven other guests on a four-day trip with an outfitter called Wallowa Llamas. Since 1985 they’ve led hikers into the rugged Wallowa Mountains, nicknamed the Oregon Alps, where one of the highest peaks (9,826 feet) is, in fact, called Matterhorn.\nA llama trek isn’t like a pack trip with horses, where some horses carry riders while others carry tents and stoves. You don’t ride llamas, you hike along with them. The advantage to a llama trek is that these tough, intelligent, good-natured (for the most part) and sure-footed beasts carry the gear and food. They can navigate steep and narrow trails high into the wilderness while all you carry is a day pack.\nUnlike horses, llamas don’t wear metal shoes that can tear up trails; a llama’s soft but tough foot pad — a bit like a dog’s — leaves less mark on a trail than a hiker’s lug-soled boot. And at the end of the day they graze in a meadow like deer, with no need to pack in special feed that might bring weed seeds.\nSo you get a load-free, low-impact hike into the backcountry, with the bonus of getting to know llamas. And they do have personalities.\nRaz Rasmussen, owner of Wallowa Llamas, explains how they name their llamas and addresses the spitting issue. (Brian Cantwell & Katie G. Cotterill / The Seattle Times) Free-range llama \nMy favorite was the adventurous llama named Clark, who has wandered off from pack trips three times, once spending three months on his own in the wilderness before being found.\n“He got away from me at Hawkins Pass because he really likes it up there,” said Raz Rasmussen, Wallowa Llamas’ 63-year-old owner and trip leader, a man with deep smile lines in his weathered face. “He looked great after three months, maybe we should do that with all of them!”\nA blond-haired llama named Mo was especially vocal throughout our trip, emitting frequent “meeps” and a sort of donkey bray. Mo’s full name is Modigliani — “you know, after that Italian artist who painted all the long-necked women?” Rasmussen explained. (It’s a llama joke; you come to expect them.)\n\nRobin Kearns, of Halfway, Ore., helps unload a llama named Modigliani at the Eagle Creek trailhead. (Brian J. Cantwell / The Seattle Times) Then there was Perseus, sort of the llama version of a bar brawler, who bit off part of another llama’s ear — though the victim, Dominic, is known as a bit of a bully, so maybe he asked for it.\nAnd yes, as you may have heard: Llamas spit. But not usually at people.\n“Llamas spit at each other all the time, it’s one of their primary methods of communication,” Rasmussen explained. “They don’t spit at humans unless you get them really upset with you. We try not to do that.”\nOur group was nice to the llamas. We got through spit-free.\n20 pounds of stuff Each guest could bring 20 pounds of gear to be carried by llamas. That included your own sleeping bag, pad and clothing. The outfitter provided tents, meals and cooking gear.\nBalancing packs for the llamas was an art involving a handheld digital scale. Llamas carrying guests’ gear were fitted with nylon packs mounted on a special saddle, balanced at 28 pounds per side.\nLarger, stronger llamas carried big plastic coolers or custom-made metal cargo bins.\n\nPati Hayward, center, and Robin Kearns toast as Raz Rasmussen concocts another margarita made from snow. (Brian J. Cantwell / The Seattle Times) Getting to the trailhead the first day was an adventure itself. At Rasmussen’s llama ranch outside the remote community of Halfway, Ore., we climbed aboard a well-traveled 1967 Blue Bird school bus converted into a custom llama transport.\nUp front sat the paying guests. Halfway back, a custom-built wooden wall divided the bus. Behind it, llamas loaded through the rear emergency door for a 90-minute drive through Ponderosa pine forests to our trailhead.\n“You asked about spitting? Take a look in the back of the bus, the walls look like a Jackson Pollock painting,” Rasmussen confided.\nThrough aspens and paintbrush It was a four-mile hike to our base camp at 6,300-foot Eagle Meadow, with 1,300 feet of elevation gain through groves of white-barked aspen and butterfly-swarmed stands of paintbrush, columbine and cow parsnip.\nProgress was slowed slightly by the curiosity of every downhill hiker, pausing to quiz Rasmussen about his beasts.\n“That’s so not fair!” cried one hiker with a giant backpack, eyeing our food coolers strapped to the llamas.\nThis was the outfitter’s starter-level trip. It was challenge enough for the flatlander family from Michigan that was part of our group. Others included a couple from San Diego and two neighbor friends from Corvallis, Ore.\n\nMike Nagle, from San Diego, photographs the aquamarine waters of Eagle Lake in the Wallowa Mountains, nicknamed the Oregon Alps. (Brian J. Cantwell / The Seattle Times) The base-camp meadow was a stunner. A wide expanse of grass and tiny lavender daisies edged the pretty creek next to plateaus of glacier-scraped rock. At one end towered 9,018-foot Needle Point, a conical peak of bare granite. An adjacent ridgetop was serrated like sewing scissors.\nAfter unloading the gear, we tethered llamas across the meadow to anchors that corkscrewed into the ground. During our stay, we took turns carrying buckets of water to the llamas and moved them twice daily so they wouldn’t overgraze any spot.\nEating well When four-footed friends haul the food, you eat like a king. Nothing was freeze-dried.\nHappy hour was at 6, with sliced vegetables (some fresh from Rasmussen’s garden), ranch dip, crackers, hummus and a choice of chardonnay or merlot (from boxes).\nOur first dinner was a curried chicken dish with red quinoa and Scottish oat bread, plus mocha truffle cookies for dessert. Rasmussen’s wife, Louise, prepares and freezes most dishes in advance. Rasmussen reheats the entrees in a folding, portable oven atop a gas burner.\nAs we ended the day around a campfire, with deer wandering among the llamas, Rasmussen broke out a choice of liqueurs served from small plastic jugs: Irish cream or amaretto. On this trip, nobody suffered.\nAs sunset painted peaks with a splash of purple before dusk darkened our valley, Rasmussen wandered the meadow to check on his furry charges. I heard him call out to them, “You guys sleep well!”\nHe’s a man who likes his llamas.\nHiking to lakes The next two days, llamas took it easy and the rest of us took day hikes to scenic lakes nearby.\nThe first day, after breakfast of Swedish pancakes with raspberries and apple butter from Rasmussen’s farm, we went a couple miles up to Culver Lake and Bear Lake, at 7,200 feet.\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Derrick Coleman arrested for investigation of hit, run Boom times in Bothell as McMenamins hotel, entertainment complex opens 7 Juanita football players told police of hazing, attacks Zomato shuts Seattle office, lays off employees across U.S. Can’t sleep?

Kelly Amsberry, a botanist with Oregon State University, told us about the lovely blue gentian flower and the pink-topped swamp onion.\nRick McNew, from Grand Rapids, Mich., brought along a portable spinning rod and caught and released trout in the stream and lakes.\nThat night, a surprise treat: authentic, slushy margaritas made from snow harvested from a snowfield at Culver Lake, to go with our Mexican dinner.\nYes, the llamas, bless them, had packed tequila.\nColdest water ever Our final day hike was to 7,500-foot Eagle Lake. Startlingly aquamarine water filled a perfect cirque below Needle Point. Some of us brought swimsuits. It was the coldest water into which I’ve ever cannonballed.\n“I almost couldn’t breathe when I came up, it was a little scary!” said McNew.\nAfterward, we sat on sun-warmed rocks and ate sliced Swiss cheese on rosemary crackers.\nThe next day, everyone brought the llamas in from the meadow for packing, and pitched in to weigh the packs and help saddle up.\n“They’re gentle animals, you don’t have to speak harshly,” said Teri Ritter, from Dexter, Mich., as she maneuvered a pack into place.\nEverybody seemed to bond with the llamas, who made our trip what it was. And as the llamas headed down the trail, their ears all seemed to arch forward for once — all happy to be headed home.\nAll except Clark, of course.\nIf you go Llama trekking My 4-day guided llama trek into Eagle Cap Wilderness with Wallowa Llamas included a tent and all meals.
