However, we will be shutting trips down mid-November and re-opening them in March 2016. Get more info. Check out this article now. \nA rafting excursion through the Grand Canyon is the perfect way to cool off and soak up nature at the same time. Float tours are available daily inside the Grand Canyon National Park. These are some tours that you don't want to miss out on. High Demand Each tour only runs once daily, so that means seats are limited. When you book your rafting trip, you can make it even more exciting by adding some upgrades to your tour. The basic bus tour will take you straight down into the Glen Canyon Dam, but if you're searching for more, then you can purchase a ticket which includes an airplane and 4x4 Jeep tour. You'll see lots of beautiful sights such as Horseshoe Bend. The entire tour is very scenic, and you'll have a lot of opportunities to take some great photos. River Raft Touring Your trip takes place on the Colorado River, and you'll float along it for 15 miles through the Grand Canyon. It goes through Horseshoe Bend and some other beautiful landing nooks along the way. The tour package includes lunch and a stop at mysterious Petroglyph Beach. This beach connects you with the ancient settler area of the Grand Canyon, so you can ground your energy before continuing along the tour. The rafts carry as many as 19 passengers at a time, so your whole family can tour together. This portion of the Colorado River has smooth waters, so you don't have to worry about white water rapids. That means that the tour is child-friendly, so don't hesitate to bring the whole family along. Since the raft carries so many people, it's a perfect outing for an extended family trip or a company adventure. Just be sure you book your tour early so you can get as many seats as you need. Remember, you'll be outside all day, so you'll want to bring along all the essentials you'll need. A waterproof bag is a good idea so you can carry a dry set of clothes and snacks. Bring along plenty of bottled water too. Don't forget about sun protection too, you'll want some sunscreen, a hat, and light clothes with long sleeves. The sun shines bright and gets hot inside the Grand Canyon, so be prepared. Wrapping Up I love rafting in the Grand Canyon because these float tours are run by expert guides, who really help to bring out the best of the area. The tour guide makes sure you don't miss seeing important landmarks and other areas of interest. Book your tour as early as you can, and make sure that you book online. There are two main options available, and if you are on a tight budget, book the one that comes with a bus ride to the Dam. If you can afford to spend more, opt for the upgrade that comes with a plane ride and Jeep tour, because it's a lot of fun. The Grand Canyon is a special place that allows for some experiences that can't be beat. The best way to experience its grandeur is by taking a rafting tour along the gentle waters of the Colorado River as it wends along the base of the Canyon.
