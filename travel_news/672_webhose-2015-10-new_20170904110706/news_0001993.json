Her term was scheduled to end in less than six months, and she had already indicated that she would not seek re-election.\nIn her resignation letter, which she posted on Facebook, Glading cited a potential recall election and appealed for unity within the union. Some flight attendants were unhappy with Glading over the union's agreement to a contract that did not include profit-sharing.\nGlading has been president of the American Airlines flight attendants' union since 2008. After the airline filed for bankruptcy protection and then merged with US Airways in 2013, the group became the bargaining agent for all 25,000 cabin crew members at both airlines.\nGlading said the union-backed merger saved the jobs of 5,000 flight attendants and led to pay raises of 13 per cent to 16 per cent.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:46:58.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
