Launched in Singapore in March 1991, Zouk has established itself as the leading nightlife destination, and is expecting a new club in Clarke Quay in 3Q2016.“Zouk is a brilliant example of a local Singapore brand that has not only achieved worldwide status and recognition in the global club scene, but has truly evolved into a subculture of its own for generations of trend-setters in Asia,” said Andrew Li, vice president, lifestyle and F&B concepts, Genting Hong Kong. \n\nCredit: Zouk “As Genting Hong Kong continues to expand its reach in attracting a younger and more lifestyle driven clientele, we are confident that the addition of such an iconic institution will further complement and enhance the company’s overall brands and offerings across the region.” Following the acquisition, Genting Hong Kong will get its hands on Zouk’s major trademarks as well as the upcoming new Zouk club. Genting Hong Kong will also continue the annual ZoukOut dance music festival’s operations in December 2015.“Zouk...has all along held ambition to expand beyond Singapore and Malaysia. Genting Hong Kong will take the Zouk brand to the next level and to greater heights together with the existing Zouk Singapore team, mapping its footprint out of Singapore and Malaysia, and for the future,” said Lincoln Cheng, Zouk brand founder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:41:44.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
