Milford Sound is the poster-boy, the talisman, the icon of New Zealand ’s South Island. All the reasons that inspire travellers to make the long journey are concentrated in this out-of-the-way, pristine corner of Fiordland, a region in the island’s south-west corner. Scenic roads, well-marked trails and peaceful cruises, combined with the pellucid waters and the temperate rainforests that cling desperately to steep mountains – occasionally giving up and causing a “tree avalanche” – make it a wonderful place to hike, bike, paddle, sail, fly or take photographs. At the centre of it all is the majestic 5,560ft-high Mitre Peak (Rahotu in Maori), actually five separate peaks that cluster around a single arrow-headed summit. Few people attempt the tricky climb, but every visitor takes countless photographs, trying to get the perfect image of the mountain – and its reflection. But even professional photographers cannot adequately capture the majesty of the landscape or convey the cool clarity of the air – you have to go there to experience it, even if that means two days of flying and a fairly major investment. • 26 reasons why New Zealand is the world's best country The Maori called the fjord Piopiotahi after the thrush-like piopio bird, now extinct. Settlers baptised it with the current name after Milford Haven in Wales. Rudyard Kipling called it the “Eighth Wonder of the World.” It isn’t actually a sound but a fjord – an inlet of the Tasman Sea, 7.5 miles along and around 1,050ft deep. If you’re a regular reader of this section you will know that Telegraph Travel readers chose New Zealand as their favourite place on the planet in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Lots of people seem to agree, and Milford Sound alone receives about half a million visitors each year. Rudyard Kipling called Milford Sound the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\" Photo: AP/FOTOLIA When to go The southern summer is our winter. Most people arrive in the peak months of January and February. December and March-April are good options for decent weather and fewer people. Walkers should note that while the Milford Track – the popular walking route – is unregulated from May to mid-October, there are no lodge services, and there’s a risk of avalanche as well as deep snow on the path. • New Zealand's new flag: 18 of the best and worst designs Milford Sound receives an average yearly rainfall of approximately 300 inches. The weather is famous for its ability to deteriorate – or improve – inside a very short period of time. How to get there The nearest major airport, Queenstown, is well served by flights from Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington as well as Australian airports. Return flights from London start from around £1,000 with Singapore Airlines (a journey of some 28-35 hours one way). Air New Zealand also operates this route. Milford Sound airport is a busy single runway tucked into a valley at the junction of the Cleddau and Arthur rivers. Flights are operated on light aircraft to Queenstown, Wanaka and Lake Tekapo. Take a hike Some 14,000 people arrive at Milford Sound by foot, via the Milford Track. This 33-mile route starts with a 1hr 15min boat ride from Glade Wharf to Te Anau Downs and follows an ancient Maori path, which was developed by Donald Sutherland, the first European resident to allow visitors to see the waterfall he had found, and named there. Sutherland Falls is a 90-minute (return) walk from Quintin Public Shelter on the Milford Track. The track ends at Sandfly Point on the water’s edge, where there’s a 15-minute ferry ride to Milford Sound township. The track itself takes in many landmarks including Arthur river, Bell Rock (hollowed out by a waterfall), Lake Ada and the Giant Gate waterfall. The landscape is glacial, characterised by U-shaped valleys and ledges gouged by shifting ice. The flora varies from silver, red and mountain beech to subalpine scrub and mountain flower species around the Mackinnon Pass (at 3,786 feet, the highest point on the route, named after the explorer Quintin McPherson McKinnon) and native kamahi, miro, totara, fuchsia, mahoe around the wetter, warmer Arthur Valley. Common forest birds include bellbirds, grey warblers and rifleman. Brown kiwi, kaka and morepork can be heard at twilight. In summer long-tailed and shining cuckoos can be heard, and rare blue ducks spotted on the Clinton and Arthur rivers. Some 14,000 people arrive at Milford Sound by foot, via the Milford Track Photo: AP/FOTOLIA It’s a moderate to difficult-level hike (or tramp, in Kiwi), usually tackled over four days with up to six hours hiking on each day. A maximum of 90 walkers can start the trail per day (40 independent, and 50 guided). Usually these 90 places are booked out for many months in advance, despite the high cost of the guided walks. Guided hikers stay in lodges owned by Ultimate Hikes ( ultimatehikes.co.nz ), which have hot showers. Independent walkers must spend the night at the three huts (Clinton Hut, Mintaro Hut and Dumpling Hut, at $54 or £26.30 per adult per night; kids are free) maintained by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, which have drinking water, bunk dorms, toilets and cooking facilities; walkers have to bring their food. The season is October 27 2015 to April 27 2016 (booking at https://booking.doc.govt.nz/Menu.aspx?sg=MIL ). Camping is not permitted along the track. For those after a short walk, Trips and Tramps ( tripsandtramps.com ) organises guided half-day walks for groups of up to seven, visiting Arthur River, Lake Ada and the Giant Gate waterfall and looking at the fauna and floras en route. Adults pay $169 (£82) and children $94 (£46). See milfordtrack.net for detailed information about the Milford Track. Drive it Another option is to drive to Milford Sound from Te Anau (73 miles, 1h 45 mins). The SH94 is one of the highest and most scenic highways in New Zealand. It’s an enjoyable drive and, allowing for short walks and a boat cruise, will take a full day. Picturesque stops along the way include Mirror Lakes, Knobs Flat, Monkey Creek and The Chasm (a fast-flowing river). It’s also possible to drive from Queenstown (178 miles, 3h 45mins). Lots of firms offer bus tours to Milford Sound. Information and a map at nzta.govt.nz/projects/milfordroad/news/Transit-brochure-Milford.pdf Boat trips, kayaking and diving Established in 1993, the Piopiotahi (Milford Sound) Marine Reserve covers 1,700 acres. The fjord is framed by imposing rock faces that rise vertically from the sea and high waterfalls that cascade down from the rainforests, fed by seasonal rains and melting ice. New Zealand fur seals can be seen basking on the rocks and there’s also a decent chance of catching dolphins and even the rare Fiordland crested penguins. A boat trip is a great way to explore the fjord Photo: AP/FOTOLIA A boat trip or cruise opens up the water and its edges like no other trip.
