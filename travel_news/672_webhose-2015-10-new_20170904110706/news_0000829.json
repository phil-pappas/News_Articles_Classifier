Photographer's Note \nSão Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Italian, Arab and Japanese diasporas. People from the city are known as paulistanos. The city, which is also colloquially known as Sampa or Terra da Garoa (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. According to a report from 2011, São Paulo was expected to have the third highest economic growth in the world between 2011 and 2025. Here I was at the belvedere in the back of MASP museum. From there we can see lots of buildings (in fact almost all city is covered with buildings) and the a green area of Tenente Siqueira Campos Square. I prefere the photo in B&W since it was a cloud day and all colors became dark or without life. Besides the B&W here shows well the big city aspect and the common cloud weather of the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:04:38.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
