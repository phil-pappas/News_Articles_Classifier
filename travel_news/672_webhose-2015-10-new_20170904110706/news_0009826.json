(TOBIAS HASE / EPA) Larry Habegger, Dani Burlison Chicago Tribune \nAustria: Those hoping to travel between Vienna and Germany should be aware that German officials have stopped all rail travel on their main route until Oct.12. Travel delays may continue after this date as both countries continue to address the migrant crisis. Travelers should have passports and other forms of identification readily available for inspections at train stops once service resumes. \nAustralia: Officials reported a record number of shark attacks so far this year, with most reported in New South Wales, the country's most populated state. Although experts reported a record low number of sharks, there have been 29 attacks in 2015, resulting in 18 serious injuries and two deaths. The risk of a shark attack is relatively low, yet swimmers and surfers should use caution. \nFrance: At least 19 people died in the heavy downpour and subsequent floods Oct. 3 in the Cote d'Azur, or French Riviera, officials said. Violent storms and mudslides closed airports, rail and bus stations and affected local roads throughout the region, including Cannes, Nice, Biot, Vallauris-Golfe-Juan and Mandelieu-la-Napoule. Nearly 30,000 homes and businesses were without power. Tourists should follow news on the area before attempting a visit while cleanup continues. \nGreece: A Dutch tourist was raped Oct. 4 in Paphos, on the island of Cyprus. The attack took place at 5:30 a.m. after a man on a moped stopped to offer the 23-year-old woman, who was walking along Poseidonos Avenue, a ride. After the assault, the man stole the victim's credit cards and mobile phone. Police are still searching for the man. \nSpain: Travelers planning to visit the Balearic islands in 2016 should be aware of a new tourist tax of more than $2 per person per day. The tax is intended to cover the costs of upkeep at tourist sites, among other things, and will affect travel at all of the region's hot spots including Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza. \nCompiled from news services and travel sources.
