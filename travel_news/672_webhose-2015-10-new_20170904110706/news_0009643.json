And by the time Reece Green got to a stage of life where he was sure of his sexuality, he’d had any trace of self-acceptance beaten out of him.\nIn primary school he’d be called a sissy and a faggot. Along with being teased he was regularly knocked over in the playground and on occasion had his head smashed into a tree. Telling teachers didn’t help — they didn’t really know how to handle the situation. And when he reached his later high school years, accepted he was gay and decided to come out, it took a lot longer to work up the courage than he thought.\n“It was kind of confronting,” the now 25-year-old tells news.com.au.\n“To be honest, I don’t really know why I held it in because it was probably obvious to everyone. My whole life I’d never been the sporty type, I wasn’t into the whole car thing, I just wasn’t a typical guy and I wasn’t accepted. I was kind of just ashamed to be who I was because I knew I wasn’t going to be accepted.”\nReece’s feelings, the discrimination he feared and the isolation he experienced, are typical of the experience of gay, lesbian or bisexual youth growing up in rural or regional Australia. Only Reece didn’t grow up in the country, he was only about 20km from Australia’s rainbow capital, and the home of the world’s biggest annual LGBT celebration — the Sydney CBD.\nTransformation: Reece Green, 25, has come to accept his sexuality.

Source: Facebook\nDr James Morandini, a professor of psychology at the University of Sydney has been studying the prevalence of discrimination and social isolation experienced by gay, lesbian, and bisexual people in different localities, with surprising results.\nIn surveying the experiences of LGB individuals in metropolitan, rural and remote Australia, Dr Morandini came across some findings that surprised him but were in line with the experiences of suburban youth like Reece — that homophobia is alive and well in the suburbs.\n“There was an expected finding and a surprising one,” he explains to news.com.au.\n“Part of if was exactly what you’d expect: that LGB people in rural and remote areas reported lower measures of connectedness — perceived as well as behavioural. That was expected based on qualitative research, but the unexpected finding was what we found with those living in the outer metro areas.”\nThe study defined inner metro as within 10km of the city centre, and outer metro anything beyond that but within the city limits.\nWhat was discovered was that those living in outer metro areas reported a comparable level of disadvantage as in rural and remote areas.\nLooking at levels of disclosure of sexuality, levels of “internalised homophobia” or troubles with self-acceptance, and community connectedness, suburban LGB youth were struggling on par with those in the country.\n“We thought being in proximity to a large gay and lesbian community — like in Sydney or Melbourne and other cities where there are strong support services and communities in the city centre — would be a protective factor to those living in the major cities, but it wasn’t,” Dr Morandini said.\nThe study identified geographic locality as a unique predictor of minority stress, community connectedness and social isolation among LGB Australians.\nThe study looked at the relationship between locality and sexual minority stressors and connectedness.

Source: Facebook\nReece says he doesn’t remember any gay friendly community programs or events when he was growing up in Sydney’s west. But now having settled in the suburb of Doonside, not far from where he grew up, he tries to improve the situation, and help “wherever I can”.\n“When I was growing up there was nothing,” he says.\n“Nowadays it’s sort of changed. We get more LGBT support out in this area, where when I was little it wasn’t as profound. But I know that there are people who definitely still struggle.”\nWhether it’s attending events like last weekend’s Parramatta Pride Picnic in drag under his stage name FiFi Fo Fum, or talking to other young gay people “as a boy”, he says he tries to work with the LGBT community to encourage the support he never had.\n“We have LGBT get-togethers where its drug free at Northmead, there’s a LGBT community radio show out of Liverpool, and you can do drag or whatever at Parramatta or Northmead,” he says.\n“There’s not as much of the inner Sydney area that has all the clubs, but it’s definitely getting more gay friendly.”\nOriginally published as What’s really going on in the suburbs Increase Text Size Decrease Text Size Print Email Share Add to Digg Add to del.icio.us Add to Facebook Add to Kwoff Add to Myspace Add to Newsvine What are these?
