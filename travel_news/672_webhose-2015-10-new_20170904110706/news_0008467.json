James Martin About.com Rating \nIstanbul's Grand Bazaar, Kapalıçarşı, opened in 1461 and was expanded in the 16th century. On a map it appears like a walled city. There are something like 4000 shops inside. Touristy? Yes, but... \nIt gets more touristy every year, ever-jaded tourists say. \nBellow all you want about how touristy Istanbul's Grand Bazaar has become. Then consider that it has probably been serving tourists--or at least visiting merchants--since its grand opening. \nBesides being the oldest covered market in the world, the Grand Bazaar happens to be the world's most visited attraction according to Travel and Leisure , pulling in 91,250,000 visitors in 2014. Can your local mall top that? Minnesota’s Mall of America only pulls 40 million into its vast space, less than half of the people who snake through the labyrinthine streets of the Grand Bazaar. \nThe complex houses two mosques, four fountains, two hamams, and several cafés and restaurants. In the centre is the high domed hall of the Cevahir Bedesten, where the most valuable items and antiques were to be found in the past, and still are today, including furniture, copperware, amber prayer beads, inlaid weapons, icons, mother-of-pearl mirrors, water pipes, watches and clocks, candlesticks, old coins, and silver and gold jewellery set with coral and turquoise. ~ The Grand Bazaar \nHeck, you can buy a gas mask or guitar in the Bazaar ! It's not all trinkets and tee shirts. Bargaining--or Not \nRest assured, you're going to get hit up by touts. The rug guys will have you for lunch if you're not ready for them. You can bargain. You must bargain. It's part of the ambiance and entertainment. \nThere are various thoughts on how to bargain. The Grand Bazaar's official site tells you to lowball your first bid. Others tell you not to speak first--you must let the merchant offer you a good price. After all, if you name a price you can never go lower...and you'll go away thinking you've spent too much if that first offer is accepted. Others say to bid half of the marked or first-offered price, because it's a safe bet that half-price won't be accepted. \nTake your pick of a strategy or ignore the touts and just have a look. They will say funny things. Say funny things back. \nYou can, as we did, stand at one of the four gates before they open at 9am and enter with the crowd, which will largely consist of locals at that time, at least in the shoulder season. The place is eerily quiet at that hour. Merchants are checking their mobile phones or scrubbing the floors. There is the smell of spices as they go on display and you can't miss the smokiness of the Turkish coffee as it's being made. This is the calm before the selling-storm. Hotels and Guidebooks \nThere are plenty of hotels in the area surrounding the Grand Bazaar. We stayed at the Sky Kamer , which was quiet and had efficient air conditioning and good internet for a decent price. The rooftop restaurant was quite good and our waiter helpfully offered his favorite places to visit in Istanbul. Breakfast consisted of a huge buffet with many Turkish specialties. \nA top-rated Istanbul guidebook is Wallpaper* City Guide Istanbul 2015, available on Amazon.com . We also use the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Istanbul from Amazon.com. \nThe Grand Bazaar is situated to the east of Istanbul's other must-see attractions: Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern, Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque and the Archaeological Museum are all within walking distance.
