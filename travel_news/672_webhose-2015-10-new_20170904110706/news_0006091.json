It is no wonder that he and my husband got along so well.”\nSecret Service Director Joseph Clancy called Parr “a remarkable leader and true friend.”\n“Those of us who were blessed to know Jerry Parr will forever be able to lean on the lessons of integrity, character and compassion that Jerry displayed at all times,” he said in a statement.\n“He was a gentleman to everyone he met and yet had the courage to act decisively when president Reagan and this country needed him most.”\nParr’s quick thinking on that dramatic day in 1981 “not only saved the life of president Reagan, but Jerry’s actions preserved the institution of the office of the presidency,” Clancy added.\nParr died of congestive heart failure at a hospice near Washington where he lived, according to The Washington Post.\nParr became a minister after he retired from the Secret Service in 1985, the newspaper said.\nAmong his surviving family members is his wife Carolyn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:19:36.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
