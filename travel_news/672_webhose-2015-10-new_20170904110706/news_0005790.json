But when it comes to going without, the men have it easy. For decades women rugby players have had to train and toil, juggling unpaid rugby commitments with jobs and family responsibilities. Women’s rugby is one of the fastest growing sports in England, helped of course by the national team being crowned world champions last year. The Rugby Football Union rewarded 20 players with central contracts in August 2014, with training focused on sevens (ahead of Rio 2016), marking a watershed moment for the game. However, while England can now boast some fully professional players, the other home nations are still competing as amateurs – or at best semi-professionals – and the work-life-rugby balance is a tough one to juggle. Here’s how three of them manage it. Elen Evans, Wales centre Evans won the first of her 59 caps aged 18, a dozen years ago. For all that time she has performed a gruelling five-hour round trip to training four times a week, and sometimes more. So, after a day’s work at Gwyndaf Evans Motors – her uncle’s car dealership and garage in her home town of Dolgellau in northwest Wales – she would drive to Cardiff and, exhausted, drive back. “Things are pretty rosy now compared to when I started,” said Evans. “Back then we even had to pay our own travel expenses.” As with all her team-mates, Evans’ holiday time has been swallowed up by rugby. Her quest to fulfil her sporting ambition has come at a heavy price in terms of leisure time. “For the Rugby World Cup last year I had to take two weeks’ unpaid leave,” she says. “And from June until next January I haven’t got any more holiday time left. I do ask myself why I do it, but it’s all for the pride of the jersey.” Lisa Martin, Scotland fly-half/centre Martin is one of Murrayfield Wanderers’ star players but it is only when playing for Scotland that the 25-year-old gets anything in return, and that is in the form of travel expenses, accommodation and food. Martin, a performance sport co-ordinator at Edinburgh University, from where she graduated two years ago, says: “We train four days a week and then I have club training on top of that, so for six days a week I will be doing something to do with rugby. “However, we are not given a penny. Women’s rugby is still viewed as an amateur game here.” In her five years with the Scotland squad Martin has witnessed teammates who work as doctors and psychiatrists rush from work to hit the tackle pads at training. “They had massive time constraints, and took loads of unpaid leave, but still came to every session,” she says. “I’m lucky that my employers have been really accommodating; I’m not sure I could make it all work if I wasn’t in this job. “I do it because I realise that my rugby career is finite, and not many people have this opportunity. It is all worth it but it’s tiring, and you have to get your head down for sleep when you can.” Katy McLean, England fly-half The England captain, now a veteran with 77 caps, was one of the lucky ones to be awarded a professional contract last year. Until then the 29-year-old had juggled her full-time role as a primary school teacher at Bexhill Academy, in her native north-east, with her rugby commitments. Now she can focus on the sport she loves and already the benefits are obvious. “It took me a little bit of time to adjust to it but it’s amazing to think this – being a rugby player – is my job now,” Mclean says. “I get up and go to a rugby pitch and train. With all the stuff that I used to have to squeeze into my day before rugby made it far from ideal. “We’ve still got a lot of our XVs girls working incredibly hard doing both rugby and their jobs. We are heading the right way, though, to XVs, as well as sevens, being fully funded, giving everybody the chance to be the best they can be.” • For more information on health and lifestyle, visit vitality.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:27:20.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
