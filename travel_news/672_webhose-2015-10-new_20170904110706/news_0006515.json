There are a lot of things like budget, the need for buying and buying the right vehicle which should be taken into consideration before the final buy. What to buy? The vehicle used for handicap modification and the cost of the vehicle and mobility aids depend largely on the shape and size of the wheelchair or mobility scooter. According to their makings one can choose the equipment which will serve their purpose the best. Wheelchairs need more space than mobility scooters and hence, needs more modified/elaborated seating arrangement. Some of the scooters are portable in nature and thus, a person does not require a highly modified vehicle to travel. An individual can discuss and work out a mobility van model, budget and basic modification with the authorized dealer which will be convenient for him and user friendly. Manual versus automatic modified aids All people do not have the same level of disability nor the same problem. Some people have higher degree of disability while some moderate and some have lower degree of disability. Depending on the disability degree, one can choose the mobility aids and their nature. Manual mobility aids like detachable foldable ramps, wheel spinner etc. are cheaper in cost while the automatic mobility products like remote sensor sliding doors, foldable ramps and power driven hand controls are higher. The dealers have stock of both manual and automatic mobility products and one can choose between them according to their budget and comforts. Self-driven or passenger vehicle The modifications of a vehicle are done keeping in mind the nature of travel. The people can opt for self-driven cars or passenger vehicles. The modification done in passenger vehicles are relatively cheaper than the self-driven vehicles as the additional cost of hand controls are not there. People can choose from manual detachable ramps to automatic foldable ramps attached to the lowered floors of the van. In self driven wheelchair vans, depending on the degree of disability, inexpensive simple spinner knobs and manual hand controls are added. People with higher degree of disability and with no budget constraints go for the automatic hand driving controls, remote sensor foldable ramps and adjustable rotating wheelchair seat slots. In self driven vehicles, the floor of the vehicle is lowered sideways, sliding doors and remote sensors operate the functioning of ramps and wheelchair accessibility. The seat is removed for making space for the wheelchair to fit in. The wheelchair is tied down in pace with stabilizing belts. Learning to drive vehicle for disabled drivers Handicap people should be physically and mentally prepared before driving wheelchair accessible vans. There are a number of certified rehabilitation centers which offer driving lessons. They teach a person how to drive with the help of hand controls placed in the steering panel also helps in steadying the steering wheel. They also include some pre driving tests like eyesight, control over the vehicle, reaction time and sense of road judgement before starting with the driving lessons and for helping in getting special license.
