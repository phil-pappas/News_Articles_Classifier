It will be the second campaign where such data is analyzed and publicized. The first announcement was made half a year ago, in June As such ratings are of great interest, they will be revealed every 6 months.\n \n“We encourage all airports to test the speed of WiFi connection in their premises using Rotten WiFi app or web. Especially if a venue has invested in upgrading WiFi infrastructure and it provides significantly better connectivity,“ says Arturas Jonkus, Rotten WiFi co- founder.“Passengers constantly measure Internet quality using Rotten WiFi app in various public places. They are like “secret buyers”, or in this case – “secret users” of the service they are provided with. Venues cannot prepare for this creating “perfect conditions” for fast speed WiFi so results are matching real situation when places are crowded and most of people are connected to the airport network,” Arturas comments.\n \nAt the moment Rotten WiFi app users have tested over 175 airports in 56 countries evaluating speed and quality of WiFi connection as well as expressing their satisfaction based on NPS method.\n \nSource:-Rotten WiFi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:46:24.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
