Justin Bowman, CEO of ACS, explains: “Our diversification strategy has led us to open this new division and we are delighted to welcome Gordon Potter who brings with him extensive experience in trading in aircraft sales and acquisitions. He has been buying and selling helicopters and fixed wing aircraft in all business jet categories for many years. \n“With our global network of offices and the existing infrastructure of the company, we have the perfect base from which to market this new service to owners and potential buyers. Many of our clients own aircraft, or are looking to buy one – the same applies to operators that we deal with. Before now we have missed out on this potential, but Gordon can now add this new string to our bow. “This is a very exciting new development for ACS and we are delighted that Gordon will be working with us to establish and grow it.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:30:48.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
