The partnership will assist international associations grow and better serve their overseas members by using respective partner cities as regional conduits to extend their efforts around the world. \nThe development cements the positions of the four partner cities – Dubai, Washington DC, Singapore and Brussels – as the leading global hubs for international associations and creates synergistic relationships which ensure key advantages for international associations. The partnership will also help reduce barriers, and facilitate the activities of international associations seeking to work across different cultures. \nThe partner cities, each global hubs for international associations, will leverage the synergies of working together while still promoting their individual destinations. The partners will use each city’s status as a gateway to support association activities in their respective part of the world. Furthermore, the partnership will also allow cross-promotion of partner cities to decision makers in charge of global strategies and expansion plans. \nThe initiative comes as a response to the increasing decentralization of international associations, which are looking to develop and better support their global membership base. The new partnership will also serve as an effective global platform upon which international associations can build capacity in each region, and capitalize on the potential of each region’s growth in activities and membership. \n“International associations are constantly on the lookout to establish a strong base in key regions around the world in order to offer value and customized services to their membership. By leveraging this new partnership, international associations now have the opportunity to roll out global strategies and take advantage of local opportunities in key partner countries in a manner that is simple, well-coordinated and highly convenient,” said Hervé Bosquet, visit.brussels, speaking on behalf of the partnership. \nThe Global Association Hubs each have a strong identity, priorities and course of action in growing international associations’ activities in their specific city. However, they share a common understanding and expertise in working with international associations, giving them a unique competitive advantage: \n• According to the Union of International Associations (UIA), the cities are the leading bases for association headquarters and regional offices in their respective regions of the world. • They have established creative partnerships with local economic development agencies and have engaged in innovative teamwork with their local association partners, making them the natural gateways into their respective Regions. • They already perform a wide range of specific services for international associations. \nThe Partnership is proud to rely on the insights, advice, guidance and unanimous support of eminent international association executives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:47:53.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
