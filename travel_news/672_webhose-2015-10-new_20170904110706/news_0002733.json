This is the second time Vietnam has won the title at the IAGTO Awards since 2013. The announcement headlined the global golf tourism organisation’s annual Awards Gala Dinner in Tenerife.\n \nThe Golf Destination of the Year Award was announced as part of the influential IAGTO Awards, held at the end of International Golf Travel Market, the golf travel industry’s annual trade show. It is the benchmark accolades for the golf tourism industry and the five Golf Destination of the Year winners – for North America, Latin America, Europe, and Africa & the Gulf States, in addition to Asia & Australasia – are voted for by IAGTO’s golf tour operator members from over 60 countries. Criteria they are asked to consider are:\n \nCustomer satisfaction, Quality of golf courses & accommodation, Value for money, Professional conduct of suppliers, Support from the local tourism industry and Accessibility to tee times  \n \nVietnam, a rising star of the East, fascinates with its enchanting history, rich and varied culture and breathtaking landscapes. At present, there are over 30 golf courses across the country designed by renowned world golfers including Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Colin Montgomerie and Lee Trevino. There are 19 other golf course projects under study and if it is all approved, Vietnam will have 114 golf courses under the national plan.\n \n \nVietnam’s golf courses appeal to all levels of golfer, from beginners up to professional players and they include the world-class Vinpearl Golf Nha Trang course – the first island golf course designed by IMG Worldwide or the Asia’s new golf tourism hotspot – Central Coast includes 3 international-standards golf courses designed by world- renowned golfers. More domestic and international golf events have been organised each year in the region, helping to give Vietnam attention in the golf world as well as Big-names events such as Accor Vietnam World Masters Golf Championship.\n \n \nAdding to its portfolio, Vinpearl Golf (a member of Vietnam’s leading conglomerate Vingroup) is working on an extensive plan to develop 4 golf courses in premier destinations in Vietnam, ranging from 18-hole to 36-hole projects. In 2016, it also proposed to develop the first 54-hole courses in Vietnam, which is considered the biggest golf development project in the country.\n \nSpeaking about the Golf Destination of the Year Award, Vinpearl Golf’s Director of Sales & Marketing – Niklas Robinson commented: “The IAGTO award will give the destination a good motivation to further improve the service levels of Vietnam’s golf product and expand the number of FAM trips for the IAGTO tour operators so they will have the opportunity to get to know the destination and increase the number of golfers they send there.”\n \nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:25:11.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
