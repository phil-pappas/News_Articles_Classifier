Both awards received by Air France are the result of a satisfaction survey, carried out online with close to 19 million customers.\nAIR FRANCE’S MOST PRESTIGIOUS CABINS\nIn the new La Première cabin, La Première guests each have a designer suite, ensuring optimum privacy. Air France has dressed each suite with thick curtains, held back with leather tiebacks. A unique and daring concept, they enable the passenger to decide whether to be totally isolated or just partially. In an instant, the La Première seat turns into a fully-flat bed over two metres long. With the curtains closed, the partition raised and soft lighting, the suite embraces the passenger, for complete privacy. During the trip, each guest has a personal 24-inch (61cm) HD touch screen, one of the largest ever seen on board.\nIn the Business cabin, Air France has designed a real cocoon in the sky. The seat adapts to the shape of each individual, from seating position to a real 2-metre long bed. At the heart of the curved structure, each passenger creates their own space, enveloping and protective, according to their desires. The seat’s soft foam is designed to offer impeccable quality of sleep. With a soft duvet and XXL-sized feather down pillow, everything has been designed to ensure peaceful sleep among the clouds. Each passenger has a wide 16-inch (41 cm) HD touch screen.\nIn Premium Economy, more comfortable seat cushions and a multi-position footrest further enhance this travel cabin. In Economy class, there is a new fully-revised seat, with more legroom, a new seat cushion, more comfortable headrests and a wider tray table. The seat also features new functionalities including an electric socket and a headphones holder. As for entertainment, wider HD touch screens have been introduced, measuring 12 inches in Premium Economy and 9 inches in Economy. More than 1,000 hours of music, film, games and other programmes are available on demand.\nPERSONALIZED SERVICES FOR CHINESE PASSENGERS\nAir France offers customers on its Chinese routes the excellence of personalized service combined with many products developed exclusively for flights to and from China.\nAt Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, staff speaking Mandarin and Cantonese are on hand for customers to assist with formalities on departure, arrival and when they have connections.\nOn board, the crews offer a custom-designed service adapted to Chinese passengers. This constant search for excellence, hospitality and service is reflected both in gestures and in the polite vocabulary used. In addition, there are Chinese interpreters on board all Air France flights to and from China.\nOnboard announcements are made in Mandarin or Cantonese depending on the flight’s origin and destination. Adapted versions of Air France inflight magazines in Chinese are available to passengers, as well as a selection of Chinese newspapers and magazines. In the new cabins, wide high-definition individual touch screens show up to 1,000 hours of programmes on demand in numerous languages, including some films in their original Chinese version or with subtitles.\nDuring the flight, all passengers are given menus translated into Chinese as well as oshiboris (hot or cold towels) just after boarding. As far as the meal service is concerned, Air France takes care to adapt to the culture and dietary requirements of its customers, while providing a French-style dining experience. For its Chinese passengers, the Chefs at Servair, an Air France subsidiary specialized in airline catering, design an offer of refined Chinese dishes. Moreover, a new selection of dishes has been introduced on the menu in the Air France La Première and Business cabins, on departure from Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. The Company now works with internationally-renowned French chef Paul Pairet, who has taken up the challenge of proposing exceptional French cuisine on departure from these three Chinese destinations.\nAIR FRANCE-KLM, A VAST NETWORK SERVING GREATER CHINA\nDuring the 2015-2016 winter season, Air France and KLM operate up to 77 weekly flights connecting their hubs at Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam-Schiphol to 9 destinations in Greater China – Guangzhou, Chengdu, Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Taipei and Wuhan.\nSource: Air France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:46:33.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
