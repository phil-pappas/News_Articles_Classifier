Madagascar is not the most obvious destination for a cycling holiday: one of the world’s poorest countries, only 11 per cent of roadway is paved. South of the town of Antalaha, where I started, the road had shed its tarmac skin and taken a more primordial form. It snaked through oppressive trees, erupted out along bone-white beaches, before it crept back into darkness. It changed from dirt to sand to bog, at times it vanished completely beneath languid rivers and taunted travellers by rematerialising on the other side. With the exception of scattered, remote communities, the road slithered around the Masoala peninsula. • The best long-distance cycle routes I emerged from a week in the wilderness and reached the start of the official-sounding “Route Nationale 5” at Maroantsetra, but my dream of asphalt and haste were abruptly suffocated by mud. The “worst road in the country” transformed my bicycle into a stubborn packhorse that needed to be dragged along the unforgiving landscape for days. Finally, I am claimed by the road. Defeated. Weary. Alone. As I wiped the mud from my face and squinted upwards, I was greeted by a Malagasy man, dark skin contrasting with an impossibly white shirt. I took his proffered hand. As I scrambled to my feet, I mustered up some broken French. “Merci beaucoup. Comment t’appelles tu?” Madagascar's Masoala National Park seems to cater well for cyclists Photo: Alamy Nothing. He smiled playfully while he gestured to my bike, which sat next to his. I followed, and immediately started skidding down a crevasse while I stared bewildered as he sashayed along ridge lines, and skipped from peak to peak. My distraction proved fatal – I am back in the mud. He looked and waited. • The world's most dangerous roads I started again. I fell again. Irritably, I told him to go on, but if he understood he showed no sign of it. His amused smile forced me back into the saddle. We continued like this for hours. But my falls were a little less regular. Studying my nimble guide, slowly I learned. As we passed through a village, a group of children saw me and screamed. His only words were: “Their parents tell them white people steal and eat them. Funny, no?” I tried to ask why, but he had already set off. I chased to catch up; as I got closer, he took it as a challenge and accelerated. We raced along the road, eluding the traps that lay in wait. A little faster and I was just behind, right on his shoulder, about to overtake – could it be? With a smirk, he bounded ahead, leaving me breathless as his white shirt flickered into the distance.
