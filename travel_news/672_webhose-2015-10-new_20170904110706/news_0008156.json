As an organiser of industry-leading events, we will bring our tried and tested and successful hospitality brand together with food in The Food & Hotel Show New Delhi, providing global businesses supplying products to hotels and restaurants with the best possible direct route to the Indian market.”\n“FHRAI identified a total 8,707 hotels and 12,750 restaurants in the Indian market at present,” continued Davidson. “The majority of rooms are 5-star and many are foreign brands including Marriott, Starwood and Accor. As the industry continues to grow at a fast pace, it is now considered as one of the most lucrative and profitable in the Indian market, contributing a significant amount of foreign exchange to the economy. Thai firm Onyx Hospitality and Kingsbridge India hotel asset management firm recently announced a joint venture to open seven hotels in the country by 2018, while Goldman Sachs has invested $40.37million in Vatika Hotels.”\nThe Government of India is investing significantly in tourism with major initiatives including the e-Tourist Visa (eTV) scheme which launched in 2014. For the first time foreign travellers can apply for a Visa from home, rather than having to visit an Indian Embassy. The effect of the new eTV scheme has been drastic with a reported 1209% increase in tourists from January 2014 to January 2015. The Government recently announced the number of countries currently able to apply for this visa will be increased to 180 using a phased approach.\nAccording to the Ministry of Tourism, India currently ranks 11th in the world for international tourist arrivals, and has been ranked as 4th most preferred travel destination by The Lonely Planet in 2015.\nDavidson continued: “The potential in the India tourism and hospitality market is unparalleled. We will introduce The Food & Hotel Show New Delhi and popular knowledge forum the Vision Conference as the ultimate platforms to network, invest and gain insight.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:36:28.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
