The first limited access, divided superhighway in America opened this month 75 years ago - the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The 1940 road ran for 160 miles, and featured seven tunnels, 10 service plazas, and 11 interchanges. Now part of the Interstate Highway System, the turnpike has been improved and extended, and at 514 miles, is more than triple its original length. A passenger vehicle traveling the entire 360 miles of the main line today pays $39.90 in cash upon exit. Pennsylvania collects some $740 million annually from tolls, while spending $7.6 billion on its highways. Nationally, states spend $112 billion per year on their roads.
