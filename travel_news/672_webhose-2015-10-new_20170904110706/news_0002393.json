Into its third year, the fair will impress visitors with an unrivaled showcase of quality jewelry and gems at the most alluring prices, sealing its leading position as the most significant fine jewelry event in the region. \nCovering a massive space of about 200 tennis courts, the four-day fine jewelry fair presents over 100,000 pieces of fine jewelry in ten product-themed and country pavilions. Visitors will be able to access at one location the best of international fine jewelry by manufacturers and wholesalers from all around the world. \nExclusively endorsed by the Singapore Jewellers Association (SJA) and the Diamond Exchange of Singapore (DES), the fair sets itself apart in the regional marketplace as the annual affair to wait and save for. It offers a colossal constellation of fine jewelry from affordable everyday pieces to extravagant luxury collections for casual shoppers, serious investors and trade buyers. \nPolished from a gem-quality 15.40 carat rough diamond mined in 2012, the two accompanying diamonds are the largest matched pair of fancy vivid yellow diamonds from Australia's argyle mine. \nRiding on the success of the first two shows, some of the country pavilions at the fair have expanded in size to offer even greater variety to visitors. For instance, this year will feature more than 24 Japanese exhibitors occupying approximately 270 square meters of exhibition space - a 50% increase over the previous edition. \nKnown for their meticulous craftsmanship and fine precision, the Japanese jewelers will not only put up popular Japanese corals and pearls at the fair, but will also introduce visitors to \"re-styled jewelry\", a thriving trend in Japan gaining traction as a significant market segment. \nSingapore Jewelry & Gem Fair 2015 is open from 22nd to 25th October 2015, 11am till 8pm (7pm on the last day), at Sands Expo and Convention Centre Halls A & B. Admission is free.
