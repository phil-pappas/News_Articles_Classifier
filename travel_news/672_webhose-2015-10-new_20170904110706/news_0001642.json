The event has been an unqualified success for Tenerife.”\nThe 18th edition of IGTM, which was sponsored by Tenerife Tourism Corporation, Turespaña and the Canary Island Government and organised by Reed Exhibitions, took place at the Magma Conference Centre from October 5-8, and was the first time that Tenerife had been handed the honour of hosting the event.\nThis year’s event, one of the biggest in its history, brought together a record number of buyers, 500 exhibitors from 65 countries and more than 50 registered media.\nFeaturing key figures from the global golf travel industry from countries as far afield as Malaysia, Australia, China, Russia and Japan, an estimated 11,300 pre-scheduled meetings took place during the course of the four days.\nThe largest of the Canary Islands and blessed with average annual temperatures of 23⁰, Tenerife is an established destination for European golfers both in the winter and summer thanks to its perfect all-year round climate, as well as being the ideal place for people of all ages to enjoy a range of sports and outdoor activities.\nFeaturing nine different and varied layouts, the island offers 70km of beaches and a wide range of cultural highlights and activities both on and off the water, making it the ideal location for a golf break. Last year alone, its courses took an impressive combined total of 300,000 green fees.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:48:12.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
