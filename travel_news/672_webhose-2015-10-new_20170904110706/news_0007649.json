It might be enjoyable to have the time to get engrossed in a novel or to sip cocktails by the pool for a day or two, but after that lounging around can seem like a wasted opportunity. \nNew Experiences \nOn holiday we are generally open to new experiences and we have time on our hands to give things a go. On holiday we are more inclined to sign up for kayaking trips, horse riding treks or climbing and abseiling experiences. We might spend endless hours swimming and snorkelling in the sea, or hire bikes to head a little off the beaten track. These all give us a unique experience of the country we are visiting, bring us closer to nature and provide us with great memories. \nRather than the odd day trip and active experience, some people need to be fully engrossed in physical activity in order to switch off from the daily demands and release their tension. Whether exploring the sights by trekking along an established pathway, bounding through a landscape on a mountain bike or spending every available hour improving skills on the tennis courts, there are plenty of active holidays to appeal to all tastes. \nThere is certainly no shortage of people heading for the slopes during the ski season, opting to pedal their way around their chosen destination or even spending their annual holiday training for a triathlon. In almost any social circle you can find individuals who enjoy a more active break from the daily routine. \nGreat Opportunities \nThere are opportunities to enjoy a more active holiday experience in any destination around the globe, even if you opt for a staycation. However below are a couple of European options that don't involve a long haul flight and might appeal to your sense of adventure: \nSpring Break \nIf you enjoy being in the saddle, you could explore a Mediterranean island with a choice of guided or self-guided cycling holidays. Cyprus offers coastal roads, forest routes and historic villages for a varied terrain and your luggage is transported between each destination: http://www.footprint-holidays.com/holiday/cyprus-on-two-wheels. \nSummer Break \nWarmer climates can be enjoyed on a 'learn to sail' holiday off the coast of Greece. From complete beginners to those with some experience, it is an opportunity to literally learn the ropes with the support of qualified instructors. \nAutumn Break \nHiking holidays are popular through the autumn months, when the ever changing scenery offers many wonders, but for something different, you could embark on a week-long rock climbing course in Corsica. The views from the top of this rugged island are sure to impress. \nWinter Breaks \nIf you are looking for a more unusual experience in a winter wonderland, you could escape to Finland for a week of dog sledding through the remote wilderness. A more sociable winter break could involve snowboarding lessons in Morzine, where a purpose built snowboarding park provides plenty of opportunities for perfecting your technique. \nBenefits of Active Holidays \nHaving spent most of the year trying to stay in shape and keep your fitness levels up, it can be disheartening when the temptations of a beach holiday mean it all goes to pot. In contrast an active break can boost your efforts, leaving you more toned and body confident. \nMany active holidays involve plenty of time out in the fresh air, good nutritious meals and social interaction with like-minded people. These are all factors that have been recognised as contributing to our health and happiness. As a result, those who enjoy an active holiday can return feeling revitalised and motivated. \nFor additional benefits consider the sense of achievement that has been gained from building strength, technique and skill in the chosen activity. It might not have been your initial vision of a fun escape, but it's not difficult to see why the buzz may lead to future active holiday bookings.
