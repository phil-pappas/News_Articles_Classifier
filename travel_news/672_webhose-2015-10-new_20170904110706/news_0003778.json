(NYSE: HOG) third-quarter 2015 diluted earnings per share were $0.69 compared to EPS of $0.69 in the year-ago period. Third-quarter net income was $140.3 million on consolidated revenue of $1.32 billion compared to net income of $150.1 million on consolidated revenue of $1.30 billion in the year-ago period.\nDealer new motorcycle sales were down 1.4 percent worldwide for the third quarter compared to the year-ago period, with sales down 2.5 percent in the U.S. and up 0.9 percent internationally.\n\"We expect a heightened competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future, and now is the time for us to dial things up with significant additional investments in marketing and product development,\" said Matt Levatich , President and Chief Executive Officer, Harley-Davidson, Inc. \"We have a strong plan, built on our incredible foundation, to further assert Harley-Davidson's substantial market leadership and accelerate growth. We have great confidence in our plans to drive demand and grow our reach and impact with customers globally.\"\nThe company intends to fund the increased demand-driving actions by reallocating existing spending. Harley-Davidson expects to incur one-time expenses of approximately $30 million to $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily for employee separation and reorganization costs related to this reallocation.\n\"In the short term, because the third quarter did not unfold as we expected, we are lowering full-year shipment guidance. Our ongoing commitment to manage supply in line with demand and maintain the premium nature of the brand remains a top priority for Harley-Davidson,\" said Levatich.\nCompany Highlights Four Focus Areas for Increased Investment\nIn 2016, Harley-Davidson will increase its investment in customer-facing marketing by approximately 65 percent above 2015 levels. The company also plans to increase its investment in new product development by approximately 35 percent from 2015 levels. These changes represent an approximate $70 million increase in investment to drive demand compared to 2015.\nThese investments will be focused in four primary areas:\nIncreasing product and brand awareness Growing new ridership in the U.S. Increasing and enhancing brand access Accelerating the cadence and impact of new products The company will provide additional information during its earnings conference call this morning, including details on the company's five objectives:\nLead in every market. Grow the sport of motorcycling in the U.S., in part by growing the number of U.S. core customers and growing the number of U.S. outreach customers at a faster rate. Grow U.S. retail sales and grow international retail sales at a faster rate. In support of this objective, the company has a target to grow its international dealer network by 150 to 200 new dealerships by 2020. Grow revenue and grow earnings faster than revenue through 2020. Outperform the S&P 500. Retail Q3 Harley-Davidson Motorcycle Sales\nDealers worldwide sold 72,178 new Harley-Davidson® motorcycles in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 73,217 motorcycles in the year-ago quarter. In the U.S., dealers sold 48,918 new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the quarter compared to sales of 50,167 motorcycles in the year-ago period.\nIn international markets, dealers sold 23,260 new Harley-Davidson motorcycles during the third quarter compared to 23,050 motorcycles in the year-ago period, with sales up 5.1 percent in the Asia Pacific region and 2.4 percent in the EMEA region, and down 11.5 percent in the Latin America region and 1.7 percent in Canada .\nHarley-Davidson Q3 Motorcycles and Related Products Segment Results\nOperating income from motorcycles and related products (the \"motorcycles segment\") was $143.1 million during the quarter compared to operating income of $146.3 million in the year-ago period.\nThird-quarter revenue from motorcycles was $812.4 million compared to revenue of $815.4 million in the year-ago period. The company shipped 53,472 motorcycles to dealers and distributors worldwide during the quarter compared to shipments of 50,670 motorcycles in the year-ago period.\nRevenue from motorcycle parts and accessories was $252.2 million during the quarter compared to revenue of $239.7 million in the year-ago period. Revenue from general merchandise, which includes MotorClothes® apparel and accessories, was $69.0 million compared to revenue of $69.3 million in the year-ago period.\nGross margin was 34.6 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 34.9 percent in the third quarter of 2014. Third-quarter operating margin for the motorcycles segment was 12.5 percent compared to operating margin of 12.9 percent in last year's third quarter.\nNine-Month Results\nThrough nine months, Harley-Davidson 2015 net income was $710.0 million on consolidated revenue of $4.81 billion compared to nine-month 2014 net income of $770.1 million on consolidated revenue of $5.03 billion . Nine-month 2015 diluted earnings per share were $3.41 compared to EPS of $3.52 in the year-ago period.\nYear-to-date in 2015, dealers sold 217,770 new Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide compared to 220,850 motorcycles in the year-ago period, with retail unit sales up 6.9 percent in the Asia Pacific region and down 1.3 percent in the U.S., 5.1 percent in the EMEA region, 5.1 percent in the Latin America region and 3.9 percent in Canada compared to the year-ago period.\nThrough nine months, the company shipped 218,233 motorcycles to dealers and distributors worldwide compared to shipments of 223,569 motorcycles through nine months last year.

Gross margin through nine months was 37.9 percent, and operating margin was 20.2 percent compared to 37.7 percent and 21.3 percent respectively in the year-ago period.\nFinancial Services Segment Results\nOperating income from financial services was $72.8 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to operating income of $77.8 million in last year's third quarter. Third-quarter financial services results reflect the impact of a growing loan portfolio with higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by favorable net interest margin.

The company had most recently provided full-year shipment guidance of 276,000 to 281,000 motorcycles. In the fourth quarter, the company expects to ship 47,000 to 52,000 motorcycles compared to 47,157 motorcycles shipped in the year-ago period.

These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as the company \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" or \"estimates\" or words of similar meaning. Similarly, statements that describe future plans, objectives, outlooks, targets, guidance or goals are also forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this release. Certain of such risks and uncertainties are described below. Shareholders, potential investors, and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements and cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included in this release are only made as of the date of this release, and the company disclaims any obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nThe company's ability to meet the targets and expectations noted depends upon, among other factors, the company's ability to (i) execute its business strategy, including making new investments to drive demand for its products for the costs and on the timing that are within expectations, (ii) manage through changes in general economic conditions, including changing capital, credit and retail markets, and political events, (iii) accurately estimate and adjust to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, (iv) balance production volumes for its new motorcycles with consumer demand, including in circumstances where competitors may be supplying new motorcycles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices, (v) execute its marketing strategy of appealing to and growing sales to multi-generational and multi-cultural customers worldwide in an increasingly competitive marketplace, (vi) develop and introduce products, services and experiences that are successful in the marketplace, (vii) continue to develop the capabilities of its distributors and dealers and manage the risks that its independent dealers may have difficulty obtaining capital and managing through changing economic conditions and consumer demand, (viii) successfully access the capital and/or credit markets on terms (including interest rates) that are acceptable to the company and within its expectations, (vix) effect repurchases of its common stock at share prices that are within its expectations, (x) complete the transition to the new direct distribution model in Canada on the timing and for the costs that are within its expectations, (xi) prevent a cybersecurity breach involving digital consumer, employee or dealer personal data, (xii) manage the impact that prices for and supply of used motorcycles may have on retail sales of new motorcycles, (xiii) manage risks that arise through expanding international manufacturing, operations and sales, (xiv) manage through the effects inconsistent and unpredictable weather patterns may have on retail sales of motorcycles, (xv) manage changes and prepare for requirements in legislative and regulatory environments for its products, services and operations, (xvi) manage supply chain issues, including quality issues and any unexpected interruptions or price increases caused by raw material shortages or natural disasters, (xvii) detect any issues with its motorcycles or any associated manufacturing processes to avoid delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, increased warranty costs or litigation, ((xviii) implement and manage enterprise-wide information technology solutions, including solutions at its manufacturing facilities, (xix) continue to realize production efficiencies at its production facilities and manage operating costs including materials, labor and overhead, (xx) execute its flexible production strategy, (xxi) continue to manage the relationships and agreements that it has with its labor unions to help drive long-term competitiveness, (xxii) adjust to healthcare inflation and reform, pension reform and tax changes, (xxiii) retain and attract talented employees, and (xxiv) manage the credit quality, the loan servicing and collection activities, and the recovery rates of HDFS' loan portfolio.\nIn addition, the company could experience delays or disruptions in its operations as a result of work stoppages, strikes, natural causes, terrorism or other factors. Other factors are described in risk factors that the company has disclosed in documents previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe company's ability to sell its motorcycles and related products and services and to meet its financial expectations also depends on the ability of the company's independent dealers to sell its motorcycles and related products and services to retail customers. The company depends on the capability and financial capacity of its independent dealers and distributors to develop and implement effective retail sales plans to create demand for the motorcycles and related products and services they purchase from the company. In addition, the company's independent dealers and distributors may experience difficulties in operating their businesses and selling Harley-Davidson motorcycles and related products and services as a result of weather, economic conditions or other factors.\nHarley-Davidson, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended\nNine months ended\nSeptember 27,\nSeptember 28,\nSeptember 27,\nSeptember 28,\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nMotorcycles and related products revenue\n$ 1,140,321\n$ 1,130,558\n$ 4,301,674\n$ 4,536,531\nGross profit\n394,039\n394,600\n1,631,528\n1,710,870\nSelling, administrative and engineering expense\n250,974\n248,286\n762,406\n743,608\nOperating income from motorcycles & related products\n143,065\n146,314\n869,122\n967,262\nFinancial services revenue\n177,109\n171,046\n513,093\n491,820\nFinancial services expense\n104,338\n93,287\n293,745\n276,432\nOperating income from financial services\n72,771\n77,759\n219,348\n215,388\nOperating income\n215,836\n224,073\n1,088,470\n1,182,650\nInvestment income\n3,211\n1,509\n5,983\n4,940\nInterest expense\n4,879\n77\n4,897\n4,147\nIncome before income taxes\n214,168\n225,505\n1,089,556\n1,183,443\nProvision for income taxes\n73,821\n75,439\n379,545\n413,307\nNet income\n$ 140,347\n$ 150,066\n$ 710,011\n$ 770,136\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic\n$ 0.69\n$ 0.70\n$ 3.43\n$ 3.54\nDiluted\n$ 0.69\n$ 0.69\n$ 3.41\n$ 3.52\nWeighted-average common shares:\nBasic\n203,598\n215,572\n207,255\n217,429\nDiluted\n204,580\n216,893\n208,282\n218,838\nCash dividends per common share\n$ 0.310\n$ 0.275\n$ 0.930\n$ 0.825\nHarley-Davidson, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nSeptember 27,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 28,\n2015\n2014\n2014\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 1,368,554\n$ 906,680\n$ 979,866\nMarketable securities\n47,358\n57,325\n57,579\nAccounts receivable, net\n294,054\n247,621\n286,256\nFinance receivables, net\n2,068,873\n1,916,635\n2,012,466\nInventories\n466,657\n448,871\n460,958\nRestricted cash\n113,499\n98,627\n142,286\nOther current assets\n257,046\n272,336\n263,067\nTotal current assets\n4,616,041\n3,948,095\n4,202,478\nFinance receivables, net\n5,009,473\n4,516,246\n4,653,034\nPrepaid pension costs\n-\n-\n261,983\nOther long-term assets\n1,106,044\n1,063,756\n908,011\n$ 10,731,558\n$ 9,528,097\n$ 10,025,506\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable & accrued liabilities\n$ 781,246\n$ 646,185\n$ 836,294\nShort-term debt\n990,049\n731,786\n352,430\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n891,710\n1,011,315\n1,518,320\nTotal current liabilities\n2,663,005\n2,389,286\n2,707,044\nLong-term debt\n5,054,347\n3,761,528\n3,573,118\nPension and postretirement healthcare liabilities\n254,864\n279,192\n243,484\nOther long-term liabilities\n199,669\n188,805\n217,497\nTotal shareholders' equity\n2,559,673\n2,909,286\n3,284,363\n$ 10,731,558\n$ 9,528,097\n$ 10,025,506\nHarley-Davidson, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\nNine months ended\nSeptember 27,\nSeptember 28,\n2015\n2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 1,020,957\n$ 966,868\nCash flows from investing activities:\nCapital expenditures\n(139,054)\n(120,316)\nFinance receivables, net\n(719,472)\n(610,644)\nNet change in marketable securities\n9,500\n41,010\nAcquisition of business\n(59,910)\n-\nOther\n5,172\n275\nNet cash used by investing activities\n(903,764)\n(689,675)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nRepayment of senior unsecured notes\n-\n(303,000)\nProceeds from issuance of senior unsecured notes\n740,949\n-\nProceeds from issuance of medium-term notes\n595,386\n594,431\nRepayment of medium-term notes\n(600,000)\n(7,220)\nProceeds from securitization debt\n1,195,668\n847,126\nRepayments of securitization debt\n(764,909)\n(631,302)\nNet increase (decrease) in credit facilities and unsecured commercial paper\n258,734\n(315,278)\nBorrowings of asset-backed commercial paper\n69,191\n57,669\nRepayments of asset-backed commercial paper\n(55,124)\n(58,717)\nNet change in restricted cash\n(15,165)\n2,521\nDividends paid\n(191,451)\n(179,860)\nPurchase of common stock for treasury\n(894,565)\n(393,459)\nExcess tax benefits from share-based payments\n2,878\n8,873\nIssuance of common stock under employee stock option plans\n16,755\n28,850\nNet cash provided by (used by) financing activities\n358,347\n(349,366)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(13,666)\n(14,573)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$ 461,874\n$ (86,746)\nCash and cash equivalents:\nCash and cash equivalents -
