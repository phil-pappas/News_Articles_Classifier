Having signed up thousands of new members with its innovative new QFairway scheme, the UK’s largest golf resort operator has strengthened its long-term commitment to increasing membership levels across England and Scotland by unveiling a range of new attractive trial member packages. \nAvailable at eight selected QHotels venues from November 1 until March 31, 2016, the great-value winter memberships allow golfers full weekly access to the course before then choosing the appropriate membership programme next spring. The trial memberships offer an array of other eye-catching benefits for players young and old to enjoy including discounts of 20 per cent on food and drink, 10 per cent savings on shop purchases and tuition, and exclusive member events. John Angus, QHotels’ group director of golf, said: “We received a fantastic response when we launched the QFairway initiative earlier this year, and this new winter trial membership provides another exciting way for golfers to enjoy the many benefits of playing at our resorts. “QHotels has a long-term commitment to growing the game at all levels all-year round, and we’re looking forward to welcoming many new players over the coming months.” The AA Hotel Group of the Year, QHotels features a host of prestigious venues including Forest Pines, Belton Woods and Oulton Hall in its portfolio. The multi-award-winning, four and five-star QHotels golf group offers tournament and championship-standard courses in 11 unique resort locations – and it is now also providing the perfect membership package for all golfers.
