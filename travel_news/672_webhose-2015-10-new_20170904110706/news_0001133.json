That heritage becomes clear in traveling around the area. Bernhard Ott sells apricots from his orchards to his friend Hans Reisetbauer, who distills them into an eau de vie. The Brundlmayers offer visitors jars of apricot and cherry preserves made from the fruits of their own orchards. The Saahs family, which owns Nikolaihof, makes a few eaux de vie as well as grape seed oil. They like many winemaking families also run a restaurant whose hearty, delicious food is one more reason to spend time in the area. \nThe Wachau and its neighbors are about an hour west of Vienna, so most Americans will begin and end their trip to Austrian wine country in that city. On one end of the trip -- or both -- they should spend a day or two in Vienna and make at least one trip to Meierei in the middle of the Stadtpark. Less formal and far less expensive than its parent Steiereck, which has two Michelin stars, Meierei is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and offers modern interpretations of classic Austrian dishes as well as the Steiereck wine list, where Austrian producers predominate. \nMeierei", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:33:05.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
