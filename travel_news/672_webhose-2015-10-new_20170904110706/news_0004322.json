Even in a weakened state, Koppu will continue to bring life-threatening flooding to the northern Philippines through at least Wednesday. \nKoppu developed into a typhoon early Friday morning local time and strengthened through the end of the week, reaching super typhoon status late Saturday evening. With wind gusts up to 241 km/h (150 mph), the cyclone's intensity was similar to that of a strong Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. \nVery early Sunday morning, Koppu made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora, on the eastern coastline of Luzon with the intensity of a Category 4 hurricane. \nKoppu slowly tracked westward across northern Luzon through the weekend before turning north along the west coast of Luzon early this week. The combination of a powerful and slow-moving typhoon resulted in disastrous situation for residents and communities in its path across northern Luzon. Life-threatening conditions will persist across northern Luzon through the middle of the week as Koppu drifts northward. \nWhile the threat for damaging winds has ended, life-threatening flooding will remain a major concern for northern Luzon. \nIn Baguio, over 1,000 mm (40 inches) of rain had fell by Tuesday morning, local time. The heaviest rainfall has ended for the city but additional rain is expected through Wednesday. \n\"A total of 300 to 600 mm (12 to 24 inches) of rain is expected to be widespread,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist Adam Douty said. Such rain is sure to trigger severe and life-threatening flooding and mudslides. \nSagada, Candon, Vigan City and Laoag City are among areas that will continue to get some heavy rainfall into Wednesday. \nStreams and rivers will remain raging waterways resulting in flooded neighborhoods and land, roads and bridges can be impassible from the flooding leaving villages cut off from outside aid for several more days. \nKoppu will stay far enough to the north for Manila to escape the worst of the impacts; however, downpours did bring 50-75 mm (2-3 inches) of rain to the city through Tuesday. \nImpacts from Koppu will not be limited to the Philippines. Taiwan and Japan remain on alert for potential hazards later this week. \n\"By Wednesday, we should see Koppu slowly begin to pull to the north and impacts in Taiwan should gradually increase,\" stated Douty. \nWhile there remains some uncertainty in the track as Koppu drifts to the north during the second half of the week, there is growing confidence that locally heavy rain will fall in Taiwan on Wednesday and Thursday. \nAccuWeather meteorologists think the greatest threat for flooding across Taiwan will occur in the eastern part of the island. A track to the east of the island will limit the threat for any significant rainfall on the western side of the island. \nTaking a northeast track, downpours will spread into the southern Ryukyu Islands Wednesday night into Thursday. \nAs Koppu moves farther north, it will encounter stronger wind shear near Taiwan and the southern Ryukyu Islands which will cause the storm to remain in a weakened state. Because of this, any impacts to the southern and central Ryukyu Islands will be limited to occasional downpours and gusty winds. \nBy the end of the weekend, Koppu will be pulled northeast away from the Ryukyu Islands and into the open Pacific Ocean. \nBehind Koppu is Typhoon Champi, currently the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. Champi has weakened since strengthening to a Super Typhoon Sunday night local time. \nChampi crossed the Northern Mariana Islands on Friday with wind gusts around 130 km/h (80 mph). \nWhile Saipan was battered by Champi, Guam was far enough south to miss the worst of the cyclone. Even so, wind gusts of 65-80 km/h (40-50 mph) were common along with downpours. \nThe latest indications point toward this system curving to the north, then northeast well away from Japan. However, Iwo Jima will be in the path of this typhoon around the middle of the week. If Champi maintains its strength, damaging wind and flooding rain will slam the small island.
