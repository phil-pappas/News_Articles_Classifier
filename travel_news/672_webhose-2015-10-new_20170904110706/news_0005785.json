Over 40 years in travel, Goway has seen the effect tourism can have on the recovery of a region affected by natural disaster. Now, the company is inviting its travellers to go one step further and play an active role in Nepal’s post-earthquake recovery. Flying to Kathmandu, volunteers on the Rebuild Nepal trip will stay five nights in Gorkha, one of the country’s hardest-hit communities, where they will help to rebuild a family home.\nNo technical skills are required, as these aspects of the rebuild are handled by skilled professionals. However, a wide range of opportunities exist for volunteers at a variety of skill levels, and a willing and able pair of hands is always appreciated. The new houses are also built to be eco-friendly, and easier to maintain. Materials used include stone, wood, bamboo, and support rods, often taken from damaged structures to maximise resources.\nWith a focus on voluntourism, the weeklong trip includes airport transfers, one night’s hotel accommodation in Kathmandu, comfortable tent accommodation in the village of Gorkha with daily breakfast, lunch, and dinner, ground transport, taxes, a farewell dinner, souvenir duffel bag, a contribution towards expenses for rebuild support staff, and a US$300 donation for building supplies. Goway can also assist guests with international flights, visas, and travel insurance.\nTravellers wishing to experience more of Nepal may wish to extend their stay with the Rebuild Nepal plus Annapurna Trek. This two-week voluntourism package adds a 4-day trek through the Himalayas to the Rebuild Nepal trip. Hikers will stay at comfortable guesthouse accommodation, with a night in Pokhara on either end of their trek. Approximately two departures per month on each option are currently available up to and including May 2016.\nGoway Travel is a proud member of Tourism Cares, the travel and tourism industry’s community for giving and volunteering. The company is proud to be a supporter of the Tourism Cares Nepal Recovery Fund.\nSince 1970, Goway has been providing unforgettable travel experiences to Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, polar and idyllic island destinations, Europe and South America. Today Goway is recognized as one of North America's leading travel companies for individuals, families and groups to select exotic destinations around the globe. Goway has offices in Los Angeles, Vancouver, Toronto, and Sydney (Australia).\nFor reservations and information, visit http://www.goway.com , or call 1-800-387-8850.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nb3dheS5jb20="], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:08:11.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
