Sure, there have always been isolated haunts like Harry’s Bar for a Bloody Mary and the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz for a great martini. But in the last few years, cocktails — shaken and stirred, curated and crafted, frozen and slushed, one more outrageous and sophisticated than the other — have invaded and conquered. To celebrate the victory, Doni Belau, who writes a Paris travel guide , visited 55 bars in six weeks — and culled her sips and findings into the recently released book “ Paris Cocktails ” ($18, Cider Mill Press).\nBelau starts with some of the rules of French cocktail culture: “Do clink glasses with everyone in the group, wishing each other ‘Santé’ (to health);” “Do not open the champagne before your guest of honor enters.” (O.K., champagne has not completely lost its place in the City of Light.) What follows is a delicate balance of chic and kitsch references — cosmos and at least one “Midnight in Paris” mention make an appearance — and no shortage of drinks inspired by French artists (Picasso), writers (Flaubert) and revolutions (1789), shared by some of the city’s finest mixologists.\nBelow, and in honor of Paris Fashion Week , Belau shares a recipe from her book.\nDe la Bretagne “De la Bretagne was created at Copper Bay, a beautiful Parisian bar, and makes for the perfect fall craft cocktail using products from Brittany. This darling spot with a maritime feel is owned by two gals and a guy — Elfi, Aurélie and Julien — who are all friends and fellow bartenders.”\nPhoto At Copper Bay in Paris, the De la Bretagne.
