A second hotel will open in Abu Dhabi International Airport by this year-end and a third in London Heathrow Airport in 2016. \nSpeaking exclusively to TTG Asia e-Daily , Song Hoi See, founder and CEO of Plaza Premium Group, said: “People don’t have high expectations of airport hotels but we have...We want to fill up the inefficient gaps in airports to provide seamless services for travellers.” \nThe first Aerotel will offer “five-star hardware at three-star prices”, featuring a resort feel with such amenities as an outdoor swimming pool, jacuzzi, gym and library lounge, plus a customised pillow menu. \nRates at Aerotel are charged based on a six-hour block, beginning from S$90-S$130 (US$65-US$94) depending on the room sizes, with every subsequent hour priced at S$20 each. \nThe Hong Kong-based company will also roll out its Premium Lounges in airports in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Taiwan Taoyuan, Salalah and Brisbane within this year, and Rio de Janeiro by April 2016 in time for the 2016 Olympics, revealed Song. \nHe added: “Our plan by 2018 is to launch 200 outlets and we have allocated over US$100 million for our (overall) expansion, with US$56 million budgeted for Premium Lounges, up from US$40 million.” \nSeeking to change the perception that airport lounges are reserved for just first and business class passengers, Song remarked: “We take care of passengers not taken care of by airlines, i.e. the remaining 85 per cent flying on coach.” \nAs well, the group is launching its airport meet-and-greet service, Allways, in phrases in seven airports worldwide, beginning with Toronto Pearson International Airport and New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, followed by airports in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Macau, Muscat and Heathrow. \nProviding conveniences such as customs clearance, pick-ups and baggage handling, Allways will be suitable for corporate VIPs, families and first-time travellers, Song added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:41:45.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
