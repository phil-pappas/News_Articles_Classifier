The prize Imagine Africa and Azura Boutique Retreats have partnered together to give away a holiday of a lifetime for two lucky winners to Tanzania and Mozambique, an epic 18 night safari and beach combination worth over £30.7k. The trip starts in luxury with international business class flights to Dar es Salaam; upon arrival the prizewinners will be transferred to the Selous Game Reserve where they will spend five nights at Azura Selous . Set in an exclusive part of the Selous, they are unlikely to see another safari vehicle during their stay. They will be put up in a luxurious air-conditioned tented villa with stone bathrooms, indoor and outdoor showers and a private plunge pool overlooking the Great Ruaha River. The prize winners will spend their time on game drives, walking safaris, and enjoying the dining on the delicious cuisine of Azura in different locations around the camp and reserve. The holiday continues by taking a short coastal flight to Pemba where they will spend one night at the Avani Pemba Beach Hotel before heading off by helicopter to the remote Quirimbas Archipelago in northern Mozambique. For the next five nights, they will be staying in a Kusi Villa at Azura at Quilalea , an exclusive beach lodge. Small with only 9 villas, it is really in keeping with the inhabited nature of the island. It is a firm favourite of ours at Imagine Africa with its personalised touches and a high standard of service. Quilalea's restaurant and lounge are on a peninsula at the northern tip of the island, with tremendous sea views on both sides. After relaxing on this island, it is onto the next destination. The prizewinners will be transferred by helicopter from the Quirimbas Archipelago before spending 1 night in Johannesburg at The Peech. The next day the prizewinners will take another helicopter journey, this time a deserted beach on the western edge of Benguerra Island, Mozambique. For six nights, winners will stay in barefoot luxury in an infinity villa at Azura Benguerra . Here, they will spend their days relaxing on postcard perfect beaches, snorkelling, diving and dining on gourmet cuisine. All meals and house drinks are included in the holiday.
