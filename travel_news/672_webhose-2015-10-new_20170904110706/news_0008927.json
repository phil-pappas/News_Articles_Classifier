Danielle Neyts, Tourism Ireland Belgium, said: “Given that the headquarters of more than 2,000 associations are located in Brussels, it makes sense for us to proactively target this sector. These associations regularly hold conferences for thousands of delegates in different venues around the world, delivering significant economic benefits to the host country. Business tourism is an important, high yield sector and Tourism Ireland in Belgium has an extensive programme of promotions under way throughout 2015, to grow this type of tourism. This type of networking event provides Tourism Ireland, and our Irish partners, with a wonderful opportunity to highlight our world-class business and conference facilities, as well as the great experiences delegates can enjoy in Ireland on the sidelines of their conference or meeting.”\nBusiness tourism is the most lucrative form of tourism, with visitors travelling here for business purposes spending about 2.5 times more than the average visitor.\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:31:18.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
