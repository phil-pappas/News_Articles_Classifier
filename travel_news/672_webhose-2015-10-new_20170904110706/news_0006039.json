Following an impressive showing last year, the Brand USA Pavilion is now certified by the U.S Department of Commerce, a further endorsement for the travel trade fair as a key platform for showcasing American travel products and services. In 2014, ITB Asia attracted 9,650 attendees from 108 countries, a 6% increase from 2013, with over 850 buyers from 62 countries.\n \n \nThe major U.S. presence at Brand USA Pavilion this year includes partners such as Alamo Rent a Car, Amadeo Travel Solutions, Caesars Entertainment, Cirque De Soleil, Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau, Greater Miami Convention & Visitors Bureau, Grand Canyon Tour & Travel, Grand Canyon Resort Corporation, Korean Air Singapore, Kuoni Destination Management, Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority, Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board, Marriot International, Maverick Aviation Group, NYC & Company, Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau, Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters, San Francisco Travel Association, Sawgrass Mills, TeamAmerica Receptive Tour Operator, Tour America Inc., United Airlines Inc, Universal Orlando Resort, United Airlines Inc, Visit Florida, Wynn Las Vegas and Encore and Wellington Hotel.\n \n \nBrand USA serves as a unifying element, representing the United States of America’s travel and tourism interests with U.S destinations, travel brands and receptive operators. Together with these industry partners, Brand USA weaves great American stories with iconic attractions and “off the beaten path” experiences across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories.\n \n \nUnlocking The Potential Of Southeast Asia \nSoutheast Asia (including ASEAN nations of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, The Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar and Brunei) has a travel market of 633 million residents. With a stable and consistent economic growth, ASEAN has seen outbound travel growing by at least 5% to 10% in various markets. Travel to USA grew 8.8% to 741,000 in 2014, fuelled partly by growing per capita income resulting in very high per-traveler spending of between US$5,100 and $9,100, reaching a total of US$4.2 billion. English is widely used in these markets which can be tapped via well-established travel agents, strong mobile internet penetration and B2C travel fairs. This region also has significant MICE and education segments.\n \n \nSingapore, in particular, strategically serves as a major air hub for international travel from this emerging region. Singapore’s Changi Airport is the sixth busiest international airport today, with more than 100 international airlines flying to some 300 cities in about 70 countries, including the USA. In 2014, the airport managed more than 54.1 million passengers, the most in its 33-year history. Singapore Airlines (SIA) will resume non-stop flights to the United States in 2018 by operating the new, ultra-long range of Airbus 350.\n \n \n“Brand USA is currently being represented by BrandStory Inc. serving the Southeast Asia region from Singapore. Our in-market team is predominantly focused on travel trade outreach while we continue to grow the brand presence and multi-facet destination awareness of USA. At the same time, our US destination partners and receptive operators are enthusiastically learning more about these growing, untapped markets. Brand USA will continue to analyze the evolving consumer and travel trade trends, as each market in the region is differentiated by its own cultural differences,“ said Christopher L. Thompson, President and CEO of Brand USA.\n \n \nBrand USA at ITB Asia 2015 \n \nBrand USA, together with the U.S. Embassy and U.S. Commercial Service in Southeast Asia, have developed a series of ITB travel industry events connecting USA exhibitors with leading tour operators and buyers from the region. In anticipation of the global launch of the 3D IMAX® film “NATIONAL PARKS ADVENTURE” in 2016 which will coincide with the centennial of the U.S. National Park Service, Brand USA will host a series of events at ITB Asia 2015 themed “The United States of Great Outdoors”. The activities will provide increased trade and media marketing exposure for exhibitors to meet their objectives during ITB Asia 2015.\n \n \n• The Brand USA Pavilion will hold a Kick-off Ceremony officiated by guests-of- honor including U.S. Ambassador to Singapore Mr Kirk Wagar and U.S. Ambassador to Brunei, Mr Craig Allen.\n \n \n• The ‘Window to ASEAN’ Market Briefing is an educational breakfast seminar organised for Brand USA destination and travel partners.

These buyers are keen to explore business opportunities with new U.S. itineraries and travel products.\n \n \n• A Brand USA Press Conference themed “The United States of Great Outdoors” will showcase teaser previews of IMAX® film “National Parks Adventure” to consumer and trade media from Southeast Asia. U.S destination partners and attractions will present inspiring nature experiences and activities that U.S has to offer for great outdoors.\n \n• Brand USA partnered with TTG Asia Media to produce a series of three 6-page Brand USA supplements to be distributed daily during the three-day trade show in Singapore, serving as a promotional platform for U.S. tourism suppliers.
