This will cause higher levels of evaporation in the mornings, and give way to rain in the afternoons.\nMost of the country will experience rain this week, but meteorologists say the strongest downpours will happen in the Central Valley and on the Pacific Coast, especially near the Gulf of Nicoya. Rains are not expected in the province of Limón, along the Caribbean coast. October is traditionally the Caribbean’s driest month .\nNext week, the bad weather is expected to pass with only light rain in the afternoons.\nThe weather is typical for October, which is considered the wettest of Costa Rica’s rainy months. IMF experts hope the rains will help make up for a severe drought earlier this year and an unusually dry rainy season.\nTwo weeks ago, the below-normal rainfall prompted water rationing in some parts of the country. Costa Rica’s Water and Sewer Institute ( AyA ) predicts that in some areas residents will be forced to live without water for up to 12 hours a day until June.\nRecommended: 8 ways to beat Costa Rica’s rainy season\nContact Lindsay Fendt at lfendt@ticotimes.net", "external_links": ["https://www.aya.go.cr/SitePages/Principal.aspx", "http://www.ameliarueda.com/nota/debilidad-vientos-alisios-fuertes-lluvias-valle-central-pacifico"], "published": "2015-10-13T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:22:58.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
