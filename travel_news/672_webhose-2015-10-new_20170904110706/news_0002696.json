Ultimately, Iyer shows that, in this age of constant movement and connectedness, perhaps staying in one place is a more exciting prospect, and a greater necessity than ever before.\nThe definitive biography of Henry Kissinger , Kissinger: 1923-1968: The Idealist by Niall Ferguson , is based on unprecedented access to his private papers. No American statesman has been as revered or as reviled as Henry Kissinger . Once hailed as \"Super K\"-the \"indispensable man\" whose advice has been sought by every president from Kennedy to Obama-he has also been hounded by conspiracy theorists, scouring his every \"telcon\" for evidence of Machiavellian malfeasance. Yet as Niall Ferguson shows in this magisterial two-volume biography, drawing not only on Kissinger's hitherto closed private papers but also on documents from more than a hundred archives around the world, the idea of Kissinger as the ruthless arch-realist is based on a profound misunderstanding.\nIndigo is proud to release Anna Karenina : A Colouring Book Love Story , its first original colouring book, based on the literary legacy of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina . Escape into the enchanting world of 19th century Russia while revisiting the timeless love story of Anna Karenina . Let the iconic architecture of St. Petersburg , its richly ornate décor, and the resplendent gowns and jewels of the Russian aristocracy whisk you away as you colour Anna's extraordinary world. Stirring quotations woven throughout the colouring book highlight memorable scenes from the classic novel and take you on an unforgettable journey.\n--\nINDIGO'S STAFF PICKS OF THE MONTH\nIf you're looking for your next favourite book, Indigo's Staff Picks program is the perfect place to start. Each month we will choose the book that Indigo employees at home office and in the field love the most, and what we think our customers will love. Click here to learn more about Indigo's Staff Pick of the Month program.\nWe are pleased to announce that October's Staff Pick of the Month title is The Blackthorn Key by Canadian author Kevin Sands . The Blackthorn Key tells the story of Christopher Rowe , a 14 year old orphaned apprentice working for Master Apothecary Benedict Blackthorn in 1665 England. When his master is killed by a group of anonymous thugs of the Cult of the Archangel, who have been targeting the city's apothecaries, Christopher is falsely accused of the murder. Homeless, with only his friend Tom as an ally, Christopher must draw upon his potion training and his ability to solve puzzles to both clear his name and solve the mystery that his master left for him that was his most dangerous project yet.\nYou'll love this book if you also loved: the fast paced action of the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan , Michael Scott's The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel series , including The Alchemyst, the quirky sense of humour in Eoin Colfer's Artemis Fowl series, the mysterious historical features of The Boy Sherlock Holmes series by Shane Peacock and the codes and clues that filled The Copernicus Legacy by Tony Abbott .\n--\nINDIGOREADS BOOK CLUB\nJoin the Indigoreads Book Club on the first Thursday of every month to discuss our latest book selection.
