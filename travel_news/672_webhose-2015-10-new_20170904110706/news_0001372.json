Image copyright Ministry of Defence Image caption Flt Lt Roberts was described as a \"charismatic professional\" \nGp Capt Paterson said Flt Lt Roberts, known to his colleagues as \"Roly\", was \"a military man to his core and was the epitome of all that the RAF represents\". \nMarried with two children, he served in Bosnia, the Falkland Islands, Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHis commanding officer, Wing Cdr Toby Sawbridge, said he was \"my 'go to' man for all crewman issues and his honest and direct approach was always welcomed\". \nFriend and colleague Flt Lt Kevin Hare said he \"cared about his job so much, constantly pushing the rest of us and never accepting mediocrity\". \n\"On the ground he was equally passionate about his stories of flying experiences and his family,\" he added. \n\"He spoke with such joy about his time growing up in north Wales, and strove to ensure he gave his own children the best opportunities and experiences. Our detachment and our squadron will not be the same without him.\" 'Level-headed nature' \nFlt Lt Scott, who was married, was undertaking his first operational tour with the Puma before he qualified as a tactics instructor next year. \nHis wife said her heart was broken that \"such a vivacious, young and amazing person can be taken so cruelly and suddenly\". Media caption Gp Capt Simon Paterson: \"The RAF mourns the loss of two of its most capable and dedicated colleagues and friends\" \nGp Capt Paterson said he was a \"well-respected pilot\" whose \"experience and level-headed nature made him an ideal pilot to go to Afghanistan on operations\". \nHis commanding officer, Wing Cdr Mark Biggadike, said \"Scotty\" was \"not one to seek the limelight\" and was one of the \"most dependable and intelligent officers\" he had ever worked with. \nDefence Secretary Michael Fallon said: \"The heartfelt tributes paid to Flt Lt Scott and Flt Lt Roberts demonstrate that they were both highly respected and professional members of the RAF. \n\"Their untimely deaths are a tragedy and my thoughts and deepest sympathies are with their families at this difficult time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:47:23.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
