There is a star quality associated with the destination,” Li added. \n\nThai corporate interest is also returning, noted Choochai Chinanurakchart, operations manager of Bangkok-based Meetings & Convention Planner. Choochai is now planning for a 150-pax meeting and incentive group to Seoul. \n\n“Despite the Mers scare, South Korea has bounced back as a hot destination for meetings because it has a rich culture, plus good and convenient meeting faciltiies,” he said. \n\nMaureen O’Crowley, executive director, MICE Division with Seoul Tourism Organisation (STO), has also confirmed that business has “resumed as per usual”, with October showing itself to be a “very strong month”. \n\nShe added: “Mers was a short-lived situation and we were able to ride out the storm and we did quite well.” \n\nTo truly recapture business, STO rolled out at the start of September a series of perks for business event groups that confirmed their travels to Seoul by September 30. \n\nTwo programmes were available, one banking on Seoul’s major autumn festivals and the other offering a 10,000 won (US$8.40) food credit per delegate, a city tour of Seoul on coach, and up to three million won in credit towards a Seoul-based performance for events taking place by June 2016. \n\nRead more reports from the ground in our IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific 2015 Show Dailies .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:47:00.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
