The Digital Membership Card, new marketing resources and Member Offers will enable Priority Pass Clients to tailor the rewards they offer their customers. As part of the refresh for the 23 year old brand, over 850 lounges are now available to Priority Pass Members, including the recently announced ‘Aspire, the Lounge and Spa at LHR T5’ – the first independent airport lounge at London Heathrow Terminal 5. The new Priority Pass brand identity reflects the changing needs and expectations of the frequent flyer and was created following extensive Member research in Asia, Europe and the US. Stephen Simpson, Global Marketing Director at Priority Pass explains: “We asked our growing membership what they wanted to see from us and the result is a significant investment which exceeds the demanding expectations of our Members, Clients and Partners. We’re committed to maintaining our market leadership and the new proposition means that Priority Pass has the technology, processes and tools required to deliver a superior travel experience, every time. This is our broadest product improvement to date, with a brand new website, smartphone apps and rejuvenated brand, along with a product roadmap outlining continual product improvement.” The responsive website prioritypass.com has a new look and enhanced functionality, the Priority Pass Android, Blackberry and iOS smartphone apps have been updated and for the first time Priority Pass Members can use a Digital Membership Card for simple, speedy access to most lounges in the Priority Pass program using their smartphone or tablet. The new look Priority Pass membership cards acknowledge the brand’s premium positioning while the addition of new travel, golf and car rental offers ensures that Priority Pass Members can realise the value of their Priority Pass beyond the lounge. Priority Pass’ focus groups and Member data highlight how travellers are increasingly less prepared to pay a premium to upgrade their plane seats, preferring to enhance their travel with benefits such as lounge access, concierge services and exclusive experiences at their destinations. Many Members see lounges as a valued refuge from increasingly busy airports and a benefit they enjoy sharing with friends, family and colleagues as guests. This is particularly true amongst a young, affluent and culturally diverse group of ‘Conspicuous Consumers’ who appreciate the convenience and status of airport lounges and expect everything, including airline tickets and exclusive membership services, to be available digitally 24/7. The new Priority Pass Digital Membership Card and smartphone apps particularly resonate with this audience.
