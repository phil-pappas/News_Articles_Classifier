That didn’t happen. But although what did occur was more the product of the human mind than a geological catastrophe, it was still pretty hair-raising. We weren’t actually aware that it was a volcano. We were on a family holiday in America and while driving around Washington State, we thought we’d take a trip up Mount St Helens one afternoon. So my wife Jennie, our six-year-old daughter Tillie and I, headed toward the enormous mountain visible from Seattle, some 96 miles away. Knowing the States, this road to the top was bound to be wide, with numerous attractions to stop and explore en route, I guessed. Only it wasn’t. One hermit who lived halfway up, was fossilised when he ignored repeated warnings to leave... We hadn’t realised how steep the drive was and how near the edge of the mountain we would be and after a half hour or so, Jennie, who was driving, admitted that she was panicked by the sight she was witnessing out of her window. She said she had been trying to hold it together for a while but admitted she was starting to lose it. Being over the limit myself after a BBQ lunch there was no way I could take the antique, right-hand drive Volvo – we’d borrowed from our English house-swap hosts – anywhere other than right over the edge. I managed to calm Jennie down and decided it would be a good idea to take advantage of a rest stop. However, the rest stop featured a movie. A movie from which we learned all about the occasional eruptions from this still smoking volcano – “Did someone say volcano?” – and how one hermit who lived halfway up, was forever fossilised when he ignored repeated warnings to leave the area, leading up to the eruption. It was fairly grim viewing. Leap of faith: You never know when a volcano will blow Photo: Corbis We decided to carry on with the journey, although I sensed that the film had done little to calm any of us. Then winding up the ever-steepening track, with cars behind and in front of us, Tillie started to freak. “The volcano’s smoking! We’re going to die!” Suddenly, my tactic of distracting Jennie with calm small talk had gone and my very real problems with vertigo flooded back. “I don't think I can do this!” Jennie screamed, peering over the side at the enormous drop below. “I don't want to die!” Tillie shrieked. By now I had lost it myself, for the first time since my “freezing” halfway up the Eiffel Tower. There was quite a line of traffic behind us now, as we crept up the slope, and this was only adding to the mounting anxiety. Then we heard the first angry beep of a car horn. Deciding that we needed to take action we turned into the first layby we could find, and watched in relief as the frustrated cars behind us suddenly ripped past the idiot family. We sat there for a good 10 minutes or so, just thankful that we no longer had to scale the beast. I come from Norfolk and the scariest ascent there is a multi-storey car park Once Tillie realised that the volcano wasn’t about to erupt and that there was a retail outlet three miles away that sold cheap Nintendo DSs, she started to come round and creeping down the mountain was much less fraught for Jennie as she was facing mountainside. Peering out of my window I could see why she freaked. It was very, very high. In hindsight, we were probably not in any danger – and I wouldn’t want to put anyone off making that trip. It’s a beautiful place highly unlikely to smother you in burning magma without due warning. But for us, well… let’s just say, I come from Norfolk and the scariest ascent there is a multi-storey car park. When the unpredictable happens, the AA is there to help.
