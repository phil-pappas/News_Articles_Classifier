That investigation was prompted by the seizure in New York of more than 40 kilograms of cocaine discovered in October 2014 in a shipment of yucca from Costa Rica.\nA Costa Rican police agent participates in an anti-drug raid in northern Costa Rica on Oct. 14, 2015.\nThe Tico Times\nThe cocaine, allegedly trafficked by the ’Ndrangheta organized crime ring – Italy’s principal importer and wholesaler of cocaine – was imported and distributed from an operations center at a family-owned pizzeria in Queens, New York. In May, four people were arrested in the United States, including pizzeria owners Gregorio and Eleonora Gigliotti, their son Angelo, and another relative. Thirteen others were arrested in Italy.\nOn Wednesday, Costa Rican authorities added to that list with the arrest of seven more people. The suspects – six Ticos and one Cuban, all men – are accused of making bulk cocaine purchases and packing the shipments in refrigerated produce containers sent to the United States and Italy. Two suspects arrested Wednesday are the owners of yucca and pineapple packing companies in Costa Rica.\nPineapple workers in northern Costa Rica – many of them Nicaraguan immigrants – attempt to continue their day in the fields following a large police raid on Oct. 14, 2015. Several workers said they fear losing their jobs after police broke up a large cocaine trafficking network.\nThe Tico Times\nFor employees, a genuine shock Following the well-coordinated morning raids, employees of the produce packing companies – most of them undocumented Nicaraguan immigrants – expressed fear and concern over the gravity of the alleged crimes. They also worry about losing their jobs, as pineapple and cassava are two primary agricultural activities in Costa Rica’s Northern Zone.\n“We’re always here. It’s not true what they’re saying about the drugs,” several employees told The Tico Times.\n“Warning: Before entering identify yourself to security” a sign reads at a local produce packing plant accused of fronting for the Italian mafia.\nThe Tico Times\nOther employees and neighbors of the suspects say the two frequently were visited by Italians, but they are unaware of what transpired. Authorities do know that the Gigliottis often visited Costa Rica, particularly in 2012 and 2013. Sometimes they traveled separately, sometimes together. During one of Eleonora Gigliotti’s five flights into Juan Santamaría International Airport outside San José in 2014, she delivered $400,000 to the family’s Costa Rican suppliers, U.S. prosecutors allege.\nThe seven suspects in Costa Rica face international cocaine trafficking and other charges.\nInterpol agents from Rome participate in a raid on pineapple and yucca packing plants in northern Costa Rica, on Oct. 14, 2015.\nThe Tico Times", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/nyregion/queens-pizzeria-owners-are-charged-in-cocaine-smuggling-operation.html?_r=1"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:29:37.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
