Turkish delight: Stunning photographs capture a spectacular... China may not be top of everyone's wanderlust list, but that doesn’t mean it’s not well catered for when it comes to tours.\nThere are literally hundreds to choose from. So why did I book G Adventures Highlights of China tour through STA?\nWell, when I was researching my trip, the Highlights of China tour shone out as the trip with the most exciting, varied and thorough itinerary for my two-week time span.\nSpeaking of her trip, Siam said: 'A walk through a park in China is never a boring experience'\nChina is a 'mix of old and new: 'If there are any short comings, it’s that the time in Shanghai is so brief'\nAnd in the end I knew that experiencing as much of China as possible was more important to me than the star rating of the hotels I was staying in… and I even managed to remember that most of the time.\nI’m happy to confirm that the Highlights of China tour really lived up to its name. It is, in my opinion, the perfect tour for China virgins, as it allows you to tick off all your touristy must-sees and generally experience as much as possible, in as little time (and for as little money).\nYes, you’ll be shattered during the trip, and yes, you’ll probably feel like you want to go back and spend more time in certain places when you return, but for a first-time trip it’s perfect.\nThe tour kicks off in Shanghai, where you meet the group and spend (sadly) just one day in China’s most glamorous city. If there are any short comings to the trip, it’s that the time in Shanghai is so brief. But if time is on your side, you can always arrive in a day or two early – as some of my tour mates did – and do some exploring on your own.\nIf like me you don’t have the luxury of time, on your second evening in China you zoom out of Shanghai on the bullet train, and arrive late that night in Hangzhou. Hangzhou – where you visit the local tourist attractions of the West Lake and the China National Tea Museum (which is sadly less impressive than it sounds) – feels like a different world compared to the glitz of Shanghai.\nSo already, just two days in, you’re experiencing how very different China can be.\nOne of the most interesting facts about the Great Wall is that you can toboggan down it for £10\n'The Great Wall, truly lived up to its name and surpassed all of my expectations': said Siam\nYou spend just one day in Hangzhou (which to be fair, is all that’s needed) before catching an evening flight down to Guilin and a private bus on to Yangshuo.\nYangshuo, which sits on the Li River, is the China you know from traditional paintings, with its green and luscious landscape of karst mountains.\nYour three nights and two full days in Yangshuo are jam-packed with some of the best activities you’ll do on the tour, including a bike ride through the stunning countryside followed by lunch at a farmer’s house, and a local cooking class. Yangshuo is a tourist destination for the Chinese too, and therefore has a not-to-be-missed bustling (and I really mean that!) nightlife. My time in Yangshuo was some of my favourite time on the whole trip, so make the most of it.\nAfter two non-stop days in Yangshuo, you’ll reluctantly leave to catch a flight to Chongqing where you’ll be boarding a boat for a three-day ‘cruise’ up the Yangtze River and through the three gorges.\nChongqing itself – where you’ll kill a day waiting for your boat to depart – is pretty unremarkable, especially in the rain (as I experienced it). But it does give you the opportunity to experience a traditional Chongqing hotpot – a foodie must-have which really lives up to its name.\n'The Summer Palace isn't on the official itinerary, but make sure you go': Siam advises\nNow, you may be thinking that a cruise through the three gorges will be the perfect opportunity to kick back, relax, catch up on some sleep and maybe even sup a few cocktails.\nAnd it would be in any other country, but this is China, which means you’ll be woken up at 6am every morning by a seemingly never-ending loud speaker announcement calling you for breakfast. Which, by the way, is basically leftovers from the previous nights dinner. Yes, there’s really nothing quite like noodles, dumplings and spicy tofu first thing in the morning. Mmmm.\nThat’s not to say that the cruise isn’t enjoyable, it’s just not the experience I (or anyone else on my tour) was expecting. The cruise offers a number of excursions – including a trip to the Three Gorges Dam - which aren’t included in the Highlights of China package and cost around £20 to £26 each.\nAfter finding the three main gorges slightly underwhelming (something I never thought I’d say) I opted to take the excursion to sail through some minor gorges, which I loved, and totally sated my gorge expectations.\nFrom Yichang, you will board a sleeper train (your first of two, and a real ‘experience’) to Xi’an\nIn Xi'an you'll see some of China's highlights. Siam said: 'The Forbidden City was vast - and in my opinion - dull'\nAfter three nights on the cruise, you arrive at Yichang, where you spend the day before boarding a sleeper train (your first of two, and a real ‘experience’) to Xi’an.\nXi’an is the penultimate stop on your trip (the last being Beijing, which you arrive at via yet another sleeper train), and marks the beginning of four exhilarating days that’ll see you visit some of China’s most famous cultural highlights including the Big Goose Pagoda, the Terracotta Army, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace (which doesn’t feature on the official itinerary – a travesty in my opinion) and of course The Great Wall.\nYes, your trip may be drawing to a close, but that doesn’t mean there’s any slowing in pace.\nPanjiayuan Flea Market in Beijing is worth a trip if you have time - Siam advises\nTobogganing: 'It was truly one of the most exhilarating and downright ridiculous moments of my life': said Siam\nSo what was my highlight of the highlights? Simple, it has to be The Great Wall, which truly lived up to its name and surpassed all my expectations. There are no words to describe the feelings of awe and freedom when you are on it. It’s truly like stepping into a fairy tale, or for Game of Thrones fans, Westeros.\nBut the excitement doesn’t stop there. If you were asked to name an interesting fact about the Great Wall of China, you’d probably say that it can be seen from space. Not only is this simply not true (sorry, kids), but it’s also far from the most interesting thing about the wall. Actually, the most interesting fact about the Great Wall of China is that for a mere 100 yen (approximately £10) you can toboggan down it. For real.\nHow is this not general knowledge? Why aren’t people shouting it from the rooftops (or should that be the turrets?). It was truly one of the most exhilarating and downright ridiculous moments of my life. And if that doesn’t make you want to go to China, I don’t know what will.\nTRAVEL FACTS Being such a vast country, it’s hard to talk about the weather in China in general terms, but overall the best times of year to go are February – April or September and October.\nApril is widely regarded as the weather sweet spot, with the weather being pleasant and dry.\nCathay Pacific flies from London Heathrow to Hong Kong five times daily and from Manchester to Hong Kong four times per week, and onwards to over 190 destinations globally.\nFor further information, visit www.cathaypacific.co.uk or call 0208 834 8888.\nSTA/ G Adventures Highlights of China tour starts at £1,499 (with a single supplement of £359).\nThis includes all your accommodation, transport and selected meals and sightseeing, but does not include international flights.\nTrips depart between March – October.
