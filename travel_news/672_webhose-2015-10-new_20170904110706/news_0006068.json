The signature ceremony was held on Thursday in Doha in the presence of the French ambassador Eric Chevallier. The new upscale property will be AccorHotels' seventh hotel in Qatar, and is expected to be completed by mid-2018. Christophe Landais, chief operating officer of AccorHotels Middle East, stated that the project will mark the beginning of a long-lasting collaboration. While pointing out Al Jassim Group has immense regional knowledge with regard to the local culture and business environment, Landais observed that their expertise in working with international brands and adapting them to the Qatari market makes them the perfect partner for the development of the Majlis Grand Mercure in Doha. Majlis Grand Mercure Doha will have a total of 283 keys, consisting of 223 rooms and 60 serviced apartments. The hotel, which features extensive business, sports and leisure facilities, is equipped with nine food and beverage outlets, an infinity swimming pool located on the ninth floor that overlooks the West Bay and the Arabian Gulf, a health club, state-of-the-art spa, conference and meeting rooms as well as a large ballroom. Camille E Aoun, director business development at Al Jassim Group, commented: \"We are delighted to be partnering with AccorHotels to work with us towards achieving our vision of building a unique upscale property in the heart of Doha, which will further enhance the tourism and hospitality landscape in the State of Qatar.\" Conveniently located on the C-Ring Road, one of the capital's main arteries, the hotel will have easy access to Doha's bustling business district, the Corniche, and the airport. It also offers convenient proximity to the Msheireb project in downtown Doha, bringing guests closer to many attractions including Souq Waqif, the Museum of Islamic Art, and the upcoming National Museum of Qatar. The Majlis Grand Mercure Doha will be the tallest building in its area upon completion, providing visitors with great views over Doha. The design is contemporary in style whilst being inspired by traditional elements of Qatari heritage. The new property brings the total number of Majlis Grand Mercure hotels in the Middle East to four, following two existing properties in Madinah (Saudi Arabia), Abu Dhabi, and another one under development in Sharjah, due to be completed by 2018. \"The agreement to develop Majlis Grand Mercure in Doha comes in response to the significant growth potential in Qatar's hospitality sector,\" Landais maintained. \"The Qatar Tourism Authority's vision is to attract 7.4mn visitors annually by 2030, and this will require an increase in the country's branded hotel offerings, including a greater variety in upscale properties. With over 25 luxury and upscale properties in operation and development in the Middle East, AccorHotels is well positioned to meet this demand and bring more culturally inspired hotels to the region,\" he added.
