Developed in collaboration with Dr. Patrick Serog, a renowned French nutritionist, Pink Breakfast is a charitable and educational initiative which highlights 2 natural substances and 6 “anti-cancer” key foods selected by Dr. Patrick Serog and incorporated into original recipes created by the chefs of Radisson Blu Hotels & Resorts.\nThe two natural substances are Quercitin and Selenium. The Quercitin substance can be found in foods like apples, berries, tea, grapes, onions, chocolate, capers or broccoli. It blocks cell division and thus proliferation of cancer cells, whilst stimulating the immune system. Selenium is found in animals or animal products (tuna, mackerel, egg yolk), and plants like Brazil nuts and whole wheat pasta. Selenium is a powerful antioxidant that blocks the activity of free radicals inside cells. The other six anti-oxidants are pomegranate, curcuma, garlic, green tea, broccoli and coffee.\nThroughout the campaign, Radisson Blu guests can add the antioxidant properties and natural substances that help prevent cancer to their usual breakfast. For the recipes, Dr. Serog considered a long list of recommended ingredients that prevent cancer and added the most powerful ones to offer gourmet recipes for breakfast.\nTo help its guests keep up a healthy lifestyle also back at home, Radisson Blu will offer little pocket guides “Pink Breakfast! by Radisson Blu” which will contain a list of key ingredients and the role they play in preventing cancer.\nPink Breakfast will be offered throughout the month of October in France, Italy, Spain & Canarias, Belgium, and The Netherlands. For each hotel stay during the month, Radisson Blu will also donate €1 to the Europa Donna association that aims to inform, bring together and support women with breast cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:13:34.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
