The annual list honors 25 companies that have been recognized by their employees as an organization that fosters creativity, trust and camaraderie.\nThis year marks Hyatt’s second appearance on the list, following Great Place to Work® recognitions in the United States, China, Germany, United Arab Emirates, India, and the United Kingdom. Most recently, Hyatt was named to the 2015 “100 Best Workplaces for Women” list in the United States.\n“Hyatt is focused on people, each and every day in every interaction at our offices and hotels around the world. Our purpose is to care for people so they can be their best, and that includes everyone in the Hyatt family, as well as the guests staying in our hotels and people we touch in the communities in which we operate,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt Hotels Corporation. “Our culture is built on people practicing empathy and caring for others, which ultimately creates a better experience for both our colleagues and our guests.”\nThe Great Place to Work® World’s Best Multinational Workplace list ranks the best 25 global companies in terms of workplace culture, based off of a global survey of multinational companies and their associates. Qualifying companies must have been selected for at least five national Great Place to Work lists, have at least 5,000 employees worldwide and count at least 40 percent of their global workforce outside of the company’s home country.\nSource:- Hyatt Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:55:05.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
