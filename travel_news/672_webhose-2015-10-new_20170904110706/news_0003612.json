Each industry-leading System Saver air dryer is remanufactured with genuine Meritor WABCO components and tested to ensure OE quality and performance.\n\"Remanufactured Meritor WABCO air dryers are a cost-effective option that doesn't sacrifice original equipment manufacturer quality,\" said Steve Hampson , president and general manager for Meritor WABCO. \"We have the complete product knowledge, replacement parts and test capabilities required to build reliable and high-quality parts.\"\nWhen using remanufactured products, fleets should make sure that they meet OE quality standards, Hampson added.
