DeMille and John Huston, it also claims the state’s biggest Day of the Dead celebration. It also can make a case for being the most authentic, since Mexico traditionally celebrates with departed loved ones at local cemeteries. The grounds host art exhibitions, dancing, music, a local artists’ display of altars, children’s arts and crafts, and a skeleton costume contest. This year’s theme is “Shamanic Visions of the Huichol,” drawn from mythology of the native Mexican culture populating the Sierra Madre Occidental Range.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:48:39.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
