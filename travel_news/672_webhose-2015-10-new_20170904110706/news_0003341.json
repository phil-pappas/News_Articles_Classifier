Transfers and a tour will be provided by Samoa Scenic. \nThe European Union supported South Pacific Specialist program, implemented by the South Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO) teamed up with the Samoa Tourism Authority (STA) to encourage travel agents to complete the online specialist program as well as to assist the STA to increase awareness on how to ‘Holiday the Samoan Way’. \n“I feel really stoked about winning the competition! I was caught by surprise as I tend to not win any competition I enter. So this was awesome and it was pretty cool to tell the family as they are always saying I should have got some free travel by now”, Mr. Milford quipped. \n“I'm looking at taking the holiday in April 2016 once the busy season quiets down a bit. I'm off to Tonga in November and then with the Christmas period I won't want to leave then either,” he added. \nHe said he was recommended the South Pacific Specialist program by a few colleagues, “as a way to learn about the different countries in the South Pacific and get my name out there to perspective clients through a different medium.” \nSPTO Chief Executive, Ilisoni Vuidreketi, in congratulating Keegan Milford said: “It is very encouraging to see our South Pacific Specialist program being promoted within the tourism industry by travel agents who are keen to know more about the South Pacific.” \n“Our program is designed to engage travel agents to better understand our 15 island nation destinations and the 5 top niche products to be in a better position to sell our holidays”, Vuidreketi continued. \n“We’d like to congratulate Mr. Milford on winning this prize and we wish him an enjoyable holiday in ‘Beautiful Samoa’,” he added. \nThe South Pacific Specialist Programme (SPSP) supported by the European Union through the Pacific Regional Training and Capacity Building Programme (PRTCBP) is an accreditation \nprogram that provides travel agents with the opportunity to develop and enhance their knowledge on the various tourism products and services that are available throughout the tropical South Pacific. The online program is aimed at helping travel agents to increase their confidence and ability to sell the South Pacific with confidence and passion.
