Still, it’s easier to find and more fun to navigate if you are following a ship’s chef.\nEarlier this year, our small tour group came off the newly refurbished 212-passenger Star Breeze, led by Michael Sabourin, Windstar Cruises’ corporate chef. He had been this way many times before.\n“My darling,” said Teresa, a merchant who described herself as the Queen of Strawberries. She watched Sabourin pick through berries to buy a dinner’s worth of dessert on Star Breeze. We each got a ripe, sweet berry to taste before we moved on to the white asparagus.\nThe six-ship fleet of Windstar Cruises plans a market tour with the chef on each voyage, which is in keeping with a trend of offering cruise passengers chef-driven events on and off the ship.\nGone are the days when unseen cooks produced fare from a closed, inhospitable galley. To showcase their chefs and food preparation, modern ships have opened their kitchens and invited passengers to come along and watch chefs procure ingredients.\nToday’s passengers may meet chefs, learn cooking techniques, dine from tasting menus and, my favorite, follow chefs to market at ports around the world.\nJoining a chef in a foreign market means exploring, even tasting, what may be delicacies not available at home. It’s a multisensory and immersive opportunity, a cruise vacation experience seldom duplicated anywhere else.\nPassengers may participate in formulating a menu, choosing ingredients for an evening meal, cooking and, of course, eating.\nSuch opportunities for foodies, both serious and aspirational, are increasing, as cruise lines seek to grab a share of trends that have been bolstered by TV cooking shows and local celebrities talking about their kitchens. People who care about cooking and/or eat out regularly at trendy restaurants are among primary marketing targets for top cruise lines, seeking to entice the millions of adults who have yet to try a vacation at sea.\nMarkets in ports\n“Usually, there is one chef tour a cruise, but we go to market almost every day that we are in port,” Sabourin said. “Let us know if you want to go with us. We usually arrive early enough to get the fresh fish. You can help carry the bags,” he added, laughing. “Or not. Better yet, hang out with us for a while and then go off on your own.”\nSabourin says Windstar is well aware that food brings people closer, both on the ship as passengers get to know one another during meals, and off the ship at markets. “It’s a great experience for chefs, too,” he said, “when we explore and talk with merchants. We learn from them.”\nOther cruise lines are deep into the chef-to-market concept, as well as cooking schools aboard ship. Oceania Cruises, for instance, has built its two newer ships, Marina and Riviera, around cooking and eating, with a culinary center that has 24 cooking stations. Among the most comprehensive cruise line culinary tours ashore, Oceania takes small groups of passengers to a food market, farm or vineyard and then to a shore-side cooking school to learn how to prepare the local ingredients.\nSeabourn Cruises offers Shopping With the Chefs. Crystal Cruises has classes, shore excursions and culinary-themed voyages with a guest chef. Celebrity Cruises has new chef-hosted shore excursions to markets.\nChef classes\nViking Ocean’s cooking school class with the chef includes a market tour and dinner that a small group cooks with the chef in a room that houses a high dining table and cooking stations for class participation.\nOn select cruises, Silversea passengers can book Market to Plate, a tour to shop for ingredients used in regional specialties served aboard ship, with classes on-board or at Relais & Châteaux properties.\nHolland America Line has a council of renowned chefs who offer advice and signature recipes served onboard. The line’s theater-style room has cooking classes (including some for kids and teens), wine tastings and celebrity chef demonstrations. Tours to local markets are available in some ports.\nIf meal ingredients and preparation are high on your list of interests, ask any cruise line about food-related tour and excursion possibilities. Some cost extra, as much as $299 per person.\nA tip: Look over your shore excursion possibilities well before your cruise. Some fill quickly, especially culinary tours where cooking is involved.\nDavid Molyneaux writes monthly about cruising.
