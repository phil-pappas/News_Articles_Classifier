Indeed, the Court of Hamburg recently ruled that eDreams has been using an unlawful subdomain and was misleading customers into thinking that it had an official partnership with Ryanair.\nRyanair urged customers to book directly on Ryanair.com and called on Google to enforce greater transparency on its advertising rules, to prevent European customers being misled and overcharged.\nSource:- Ryanair", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:21:11.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
