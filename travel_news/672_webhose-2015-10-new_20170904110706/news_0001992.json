The 134-room hotel, which opened in the summer of 2014, seamlessly melds the historic and the modern. The six-story structure dates back to 1927, but its interior has a contemporary stamp, featuring a lobby packed with chairs that sprout antlers and sparkling beaded wall hangings. Bowls and bouquets of orchids in many crannies add a colorful local touch.\nLocation Just a few minutes’ walk from two major Mass Rapid Transit stations, the hotel is a 30-minute taxi ride from Changi International Airport. Tourist attractions such as Chinatown and the shopping hub Orchard Road are short cab or train trips away. Across the street from the property is Lau Pa Sat, a restored 19th-century market that has been turned into an outdoor food court.\nPhoto Credit Jorg Sundermann The Room With white wall paneling and gray damask curtains, the French-inflected décor had an understated elegance that lent a tranquillity to the spacious room. Modern touches such as mirrored side tables and Pop Art pieces added a whimsical flair. The room phone was a handy iPhone, and the desk area had ample spots for charging devices. The large flat-screen TV not only welcomed you by name but also enabled you to check your bill or order room service. The mini bar — the size of a full-length closet — was stocked with an Illy espresso maker, teas and local snacks such as spicy tapioca chips as well as coconut and mango juices.\nThe Bathroom A large marble affair filled with a spacious bathtub and glass-walled rain shower; the French-made soaps and shampoos had an “urban jungle” scent that was grassy and musky. Bright red sculptural hands extending from the wall were towel hooks. Other nice touches included a small lacquer chest by the sink with drawers filled with small luxuries including a vial of perfume and hair gel.\nAmenities Free Wi-Fi, newspapers and unlimited local phone calls, to start. A lobby store offered a wide range of coffee table books — most of them by or about Karl Lagerfeld. Treadmills with individual large-screen TVs, as well as weights and other workout stations, filled an airy gym. The rooftop had a gold-tiled infinity pool, surrounded by a snazzy cocktail bar that featured soft, thumping disco beats after dark. Because of the building’s relative squatness, however, this rooftop pool provided office workers in the towering buildings on all sides with close-up views of all sunbathing action.\nPhoto Credit Jorg Sundermann Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Dining The restaurant, Xperience, in the lobby, with shag cushions and an open kitchen, certainly had eye-catching décor. The menu offered an eclectic mix of European and Singaporean, featuring foie gras pork dumplings and (slightly flavorless) chile crab tacos alongside more conventional fare such as a Wagyu steak with salsa. Service, however, was frosty and lackadaisical — despite the restaurant being largely empty. We found ourselves having to pour our own wine from the bottle and wave over our waiter to ask for basics. Breakfast (free for guests) was an international feast with dim-sum dumplings, fried noodles, eggs, pancakes, cold cuts, pastries and breads set out with intriguing (and tasty) jams such as mango-durian and pineapple-rum.\nBottom Line A stylish and elegant respite in Singapore’s bustling financial district that has some kinks to work out.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/04/travel/04CHECKIN1/04CHECKIN1-superJumbo-v2.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/04/travel/04CHECKIN1/04CHECKIN1-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/04/travel/04CHECKIN3/04CHECKIN3-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/04/travel/04CHECKIN3/04CHECKIN3-superJumbo-v3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:05:34.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
