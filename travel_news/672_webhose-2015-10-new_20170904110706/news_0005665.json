Wet and wild, the Reggae Catamaran Cruise departs from Negril and Montego Bay, docking at bubbly watering holes like Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville, Pelican Bar and Rick’s Café to watch brazen daredevils dive from the cliffs. The crew on one of the most popular Island Routes tours keeps the crowd swaying to old-school reggae while cruisers learn how to bust a move or two. With snorkeling and swimming an option at various stops along the way, princely pours of Red Stripe and spicy snacks to cut the buzz, the party on the waves departs Montego Bay twice daily on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday and from Negril and Lucea on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. \nBarbados For those who prefer to stay onboard; the well-stocked bar is always open.

With a crew that may have snagged the best jobs on the island, the five-and-a-half-hour daily sail skims the south coast of Barbados, slowing down for a sip in the sea, swim with the turtles or for those who prefer to stay onboard; the well-stocked bar is always open. For snorkelers, there’s loads of exploring below the waves in the wreck of the Berwyn that was reportedly sunk by its own crew in 1919 and the Bajan Queen that went under more recently in 2002. Pick-up is at 9 a.m. at the car park on Cavans Lane, close to the Barbados Hilton in Bridgetown. Tickets are USD$88.00 per person and include the whole shebang, from a chicken and fish buffet that doesn’t forget the essential Bajan macaroni pie to snorkeling equipment and Jammin’ rum punch refills. \nSt. Maarten At a leisurely speed of 15 knots (a little more than a mile an hour), sunset sippers groove to the motion of the ocean as they saddle up to the open bar.

Twice weekly (Wednesday and Friday) at 5:30 p.m. in sync with the sinking of the sun behind the horizon, the 65-foot catamaran hugs the coastline for a three-and-a-half-hour outing that passes Mullet Bay, the caves and crevices on Cupecoy Beach and the island’s most exclusive resort, La Samanna, sitting pretty along Long Baie Beach. At a leisurely speed of 15 knots (a little more than a mile an hour), sunset sippers groove to the motion of the ocean as they saddle up to the open bar. Large nets up front scare away the occasional raindrop, refills of the Tango’s signature punch stirred with dark rum, cane sugar, orange juice, grenadine and a few secret ingredients are never too far away and funky calypso and reggae keeps everyone on their feet. On the Wednesday sail, the yummy buffet is Dutch and French themed with beef bourguignon and crispy chicken and on Friday; tropical treats rule like those addictive cornmeal flatbreads called Johnny Cakes.

Moored near Plaza Darsenas at San Juan Bay, the dance bash on the bay is a two-hour shindig around San Juan showing off sights along the way like the 18th-century forts and the coastline of Isla Verde.
