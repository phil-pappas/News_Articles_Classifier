Staying overnight also allows you a more relaxed appreciation of Mount Tam, and avoids an early morning car trip to see the sunrise. \nGet there: From San Francisco, take the Golden Gate Ferry to Sausalito. From there, the Marin Stagecoach bus transports you to stops on Mount Tam. Total round-trip fare for both: about $26.50.\nDoze: The Mountain Home Inn is just across Panoramic Highway from the top of the Panoramic Trail and steps from hiking trails on Mount Tamalpais. 810 Panoramic Highway; (415) 381-9000; www.mtnhomeinn.com. Rates start at $195.\nDine: Molina, in Mill Valley at the foot of the mountain, serves rustic and sublime cuisine that’s the perfect end to a day in the great outdoors. 17 Madrona St.; (415) 383-4200; www.molinarestaurant.com. \nDo: Visit the East Peak Visitor Center , where you can discover the railroad history of Mount Tamalpais, learn about local flora and fauna, or sign up for a guided hike.\nGood to know: April through October, astronomy nights take place at the Mountain Theater and include lectures by astronomers and a Night Sky Tour.\nONE-TANK WONDER\nMurphys: caving and wine tasting\nThe town of Murphys is known to Gold Rush historians as having been one of the state’s richest “diggins.” But this small town is becoming known as a wine destination, where boutique wineries are particularly welcoming of visitors seeking tasting and tours. Add in a little exercise discovering one of the local caves, and you won’t feel guilty about sitting and drinking the rest of the weekend. \nGet there: 141 miles from downtown San Francisco on Interstate 580 and Highway 4.\nDoze: Victoria Inn includes continental breakfast and free Wi-Fi, and its location on Main Street means you can walk to taste wine. 402 Main St., H; (209) 728-8933; www.victoriainn-murphys.com. Rates start at $129.\nDine: A local favorite with an outdoor patio, Grounds has enough great food to support a few hours of wine sampling. 402 Main St., Suite A; (209) 728-8663; www.groundsrestaurant.com. \nDo: Go underground on a 45-minute guided tour of Mercer Caverns, although due to the need to climb stairs, it’s probably best done before your wine tasting.\nGood to know: Most of Murphys’ wine tasting rooms are conveniently located within walking distance of each other on elm-shaded Main Street. Don’t skip Hatcher and Newsome Harlow on your self-guided tour.\nFARTHER AFIELD\nSanta Ynez Valley: \nCowboys and barbecue\nSolvang is known for its Danish village, but just a short distance out of town, you’ll run into a guest ranch that will satisfy your cowboy dreams — but with top-notch cuisine and a comfortable bed at night. Dodge between both “cultures” during your stay, but the relaxation at Alisal is what will draw you back. \nGet there: Drive 297 miles south on Highway 101 to Solvang.\nDoze: The Old West-style 10,000-acre Alisal Guest Ranch and Resort has 50 miles of riding trails (and plenty of horses), two 18-hole golf courses and tennis courts, and is within reach of great wine-producing vineyards. 1054 S. Alisal Road; (805) 688-6411; www.alisal.com. Rates start at $525 for two.\nDine: Drop by the Hitching Post II in nearby Buellton for some of the best Santa Maria-style barbecue in the region. 406 E. Highway 246; (805) 688-0676; www.hitchingpost2.com. \nDo: Have a Western-style ride to breakfast at Alisal’s Adobe Camp, where sycamore trees and a crackling campfire provide a backdrop for your tasty flapjacks.\nGood to know: The region is well known for its wine, but there’s also a big craft beer movement here. Pick up the Craft Beer Trail Map in town and taste a few brews.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:22:20.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
