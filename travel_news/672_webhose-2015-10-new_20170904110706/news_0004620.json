A study by the Government’s Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) found that, three and a half years after leaving university, more than 20 per cent were in jobs that do not require a degree such as administration, sales and customer service. 3 years after graduating 20 per cent were in non-professional positions Photo: Alamy The research looked at the employment progression made by graduates, comparing data taken six months and 40 months after graduation. The figures revealed that, overall, the professional employment rate improved over this time, rising from 64.1 per cent six months after graduation, to 77.8 per cent at 40 months. But, the research highlighted differences in employment outcomes between those from different backgrounds. Disadvantaged students experienced lower professional employment rates, which persisted throughout their early careers, according to HEFCE. The gap in professional employment rates widened for ethnic groups – 66 per cent of black African graduates had professional employment 40 months after leaving university, 13 percentage points below the highest rates. Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said that while there was a “variety of reasons” why graduates may not be in professional employment, it was “worrying to see” that the most disadvantaged graduates – those from particular ethnic groups and those with a disability –were less likely to be in professional employment than their peers. “There’s a need for universities to give these groups more targeted support in making the transition from study to employment,” she said. “And employers need to change their perceptions to avoid squandering talent.” The new figures are slightly lower than those released in June for recent graduates. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), a third of working graduates from 2013/14 were in “non-professional roles”. Madeleine Atkins, the chief executive of HEFCE, said: “The research confirms findings from other studies that professional employment outcomes are lower for some groups of students, and we will continue our work with universities to address these areas of inequality.” However, critics warned that the definition of a “professional” role could be misleading. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of million+, the university think tank, said: “The suggestion that 20 per cent of graduates are still in non-professional jobs three years after graduating is misleading. “The definitions applied to these non-professional jobs are out of date. Many are early career posts which lead to professional portfolios.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:17:52.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
