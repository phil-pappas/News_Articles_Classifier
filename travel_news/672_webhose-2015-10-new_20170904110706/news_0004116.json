A British Airway flight would be likely to show that snacks, alcoholic drinks and hold luggage were all included in the up-front price.\nGreg Schulz, senior vice president of global tour and transport at Expedia, told Mashable : 'We will show you what the cheapest option is, but similar to what we do with hotels, we'll show you the variations on that option.'\nWhen booking a flight, customers can compare the extras on each flight like free hold luggage to make it easier to work out the real value of a plane ticket\nHe continued: 'For example, for just another $30 (£20), you can receive these five additional things.\n'For an extra $200 (£130) you can have a first class experience.'\nThe company hopes that the changes will make it easier for customers to pick the perfect fit in terms of price and added extras.\nAs well as comparing different airlines, the site will also show the added extras gained by switching between Economy, Business and First Class\nAndy Washington, Managing Director of the Expedia brand in the UK, said: 'As a global industry leader we have a wealth of insights we can draw on and we want to share this with our customers in a way which can help them to get great deals for their individual needs.\n'We are continually reappraising our services, listening to feedback from our customers and looking for new ways to make it easier for people to find and book the best holiday options for them.\n'We believe that this suite of new flight products will really help to cut through the complexity of today’s travel market and we look forward to rolling out these new services to the UK soon.'\nRead more: Expedia will show you the hidden costs of airfares, from snacks to seat assignments", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1hTQWtj", "http://mashable.com/2015/10/20/expedia-flight-search/#fonZ2oz9wmqq"], "published": "2015-10-22T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:04:07.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
