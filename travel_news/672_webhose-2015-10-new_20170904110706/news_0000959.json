Five hotels took part in this year’s competition but only 3 managed to clinch prizes. \nFor the professionals, there were 3 categories - fish, meat, and dessert. Domaine de la Reserve came out as the best in the fish category, while Paradise Sun settled in second position, followed by Constance Lemuria Resort in third place. \nBut in the meat category, Constance Lemuria Resort had the most impressive dish, and that won the hotel first prize. Domaine de la Reserve followed in second place, while Paradise Sun was the third place winner. \nThe best in the dessert category was the Paradise Sun hotel, scooping the top prize ahead of Constance Lemuria Resort and Domaine de la Reserve. \nThe prize-giving ceremony took place a few hours after the Praslin Culinary and Arts Fiesta and was officially launched by the Minister for Tourism and Culture, Alain St.Ange, on Saturday at the Berjaya Praslin Resort. \nHotel L’Archipel and Indian Ocean Lodge were the other two hotels which took part in this year’s culinary competition for professional chefs. \nAs for the non-professional chefs, two ladies - a mother and her daughter - clinched the only two prizes which were in the Creole dish and dessert categories. \nSolette Labrosse’s dessert impressed members of the jury more than other competitors and won her the first prize in this category, while her daughter Valentina Labrosse won first prize for the best Creole dish. \nCreativity, taste, texture, presentation, color, edibility, garnish, and temperature of dishes were among the list of criteria used for the judging of these dishes. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
