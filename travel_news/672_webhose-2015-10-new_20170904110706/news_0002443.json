Carnival received more votes than any other cruise line. The awards are featured in the October issue of Reader’s Digest.\nOver the past few years, Carnival has invested millions of dollars in on-board product enhancements designed to deliver on its brand promise of providing fun, memorable cruises at a great value.\nFrom the exclusive Seuss at Sea program offered in conjunction with Dr. Seuss Enterprises to the Carnival LIVE Concert Series which entertains guests with some of the top acts in music to exciting food and beverage concepts like Guy’s Burger Joint developed in partnership with Food Network star Guy Fieri, Carnival continues to evolve its vacation experience to keep up with consumer trends and exceed the expectations of its guests.\n“Getting away from the stresses of everyday life is more important than ever and we take a great deal of pride that our guests entrust us with their vacations which provide them with an opportunity to relax, reconnect and recharge with their friends, families and loved ones,” said Christine Duffy, Carnival’s president. “Being named America’s Most National Cruise Line by the readers of such a respected publication like Reader’s Digest is a wonderful validation of these efforts,” she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:08:06.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
