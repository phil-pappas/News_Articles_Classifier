With each individual hotel, Scandic aims to meet the demands of travelers looking for unique hotel experiences.\nThe signature hotels, which will be marketed under their own names with the extension “by Scandic,” will be characterized by their unique history and character and designed as distinct social meeting places.\nThe first hotel in the collection will be the existing Scandic Grand Central that will be rebranded as “Grand Central by Scandic” on February 1, 2016. The Group’s extensive hotel development in the PUB department store building in Stockholm, Haymarket, will also be a signature hotel when it opens in the spring of 2016.\nScandic is planning to expand its collection of signature hotels by adding a handful of hotels in the Nordic countries in the next few years through rebranding existing hotels and opening new establishments/hotels..\n– Our strong customer offering already attracts both Nordic and international business and leisure travelers as confirmed by our customer surveys and high percentage of repeat customers. By launching a collection of signature hotels, we will realize the hotels’ full potential in terms of customer offering and profitability, says Frank Fiskers, President & CEO of Scandic Hotels.\nThe Group’s successful and trailblazing hotel concept HTL, which today includes four hotels in Stockholm and Oslo, will at the same time be tied more closely to the Scandic brand and will change its name to “HTL by Scandic” at the beginning of 2016.\nSource:- Scandic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:04:09.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
