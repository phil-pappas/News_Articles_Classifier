(ALD), the leading developer and operator of independent shared-use lounges in the U.S., announced its newest lounge will land at Orlando International Airport in November 2015. The Club at MCO marks ALD’s 10th’ shared-used lounge in the U.S., 11th lounge globally, and further illustrates the company’s commitment to bringing the airport lounge experience to all travelers, regardless of airline, class of service flown, or affinity membership.\n \nThe Club at MCO will be located at Airside 4, near Gate 91. The 8,000 square-foot, all-inclusive and hospitable lounge will be available to all travelers, including business travelers and families, and offer a more affordable option to experience the sanctuary and comfort of an airport lounge. Priority Pass, Priority Pass Select and Lounge Club Members are all welcome with their existing memberships. Those without memberships can purchase day passes online or in the club for $35.\n \nALD operates the largest U.S. network of independent shared use lounges. It introduced this lounge alternative to travelers in the U.S. in 2006, with the opening of its first Club at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, and has since expanded its portfolio to 11 lounges. While independent shared-use lounges have been a mainstay in international airports for years, the growth of ALD’s lounge network clearly demonstrates that U.S. airports and travelers value this important addition to the overall airport experience.\n \n“As the leader of independent shared-use airport lounges in the U.S., our global airport lounge portfolio has grown from 3 to 11 in the past two years, with the addition of Orlando International Airport in November of this year,” said Nancy Knipp, senior vice president of ALD. “Airports across the U.S. have an increased focus on improving the traveler experience and growing non-aeronautical revenues. To achieve these important goals, airport directors are turning to ALD to tap into our over 30 years of knowledge in airline guest experience, hospitality and lounge management.”\n \nALD’s continued U.S. expansion and recent lounge opening at London’s Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 clearly demonstrates the growth and popularity of the independent shared-use lounge product. In addition to growing its portfolio of airport lounges by more than 200 percent in just two years, ALD has experienced year-over-year guest volume growth of more than 60 percent. As well as providing an airport lounge alternative for travelers, ALD provides airport lounge services to 13 international and domestic airlines in markets where the airline wants a lounge product, but is not in a position to operate its own lounge.\n \n‘The Club at MCO,’ located at Airside 4, near Gate 91, will be open daily from 6:00am – 9:30pm.”This newest passenger lounge experience at Orlando International Airport is another component of our ongoing customer service program,” says Frank Kruppenbacher, Chairman of the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. “With international traffic now composing over 12.5 percent of our overall traffic, we continue to invest in and develop amenities designed to serve our growing domestic and international passenger needs.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:04:37.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
