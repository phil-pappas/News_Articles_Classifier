Part of the sculpture is showing the Father of the Indian nation, Mahatma Gandhi, who celebrated his 146th birth anniversary on October 2. Passing on a message of peace and non-violence, the sculpture is also showing the three wise monkeys which embody the principle of “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.” \nOfficially opening the exhibition, Minister for Tourism and Culture Alain St.Ange said the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi yesterday was a fitting occasion to open this sand exhibition which was sending a message of peace in Seychelles. \nGracing the event with their presence were Designated Minister Vincent Meriton, Minister for Land use and Housing Christian Lionnet, Judge Durai Karunakaran, Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Panda, and members of the Seychelles-India Day committee, among many other guests. \nMinister Alain St.Ange congratulated the committee for their hard work and for bringing to Seychelles' shores a renowned artist to grace this cultural event. \nHe described the sand sculpture as an incredible piece of art and congratulated the artist for a job well done. \nMr. Pattnaik presented Minister St.Ange with a book showcasing his works. \nThe artist is set to carve two more sand sculptures at Beau Vallon and at Cote D'Or at Praslin. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
