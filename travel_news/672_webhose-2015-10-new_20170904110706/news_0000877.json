We were 88 miles from France’s Champagne region, on the English side of the Channel, in a two-pub village called Ditchling, in East Sussex.\nHere lies Ridgeview Estate ( ridgeview.co.uk ), which took the top prize for bubbly at the 2010 Decanter World Wine Awards (DWWA), never before given to a producer outside France. This was no anomaly. Increasingly, English sparkling wines have been racking up international awards, and like Ridgeview, many hail from the South Downs.\nWith the same chalky soil as Champagne’s Côte des Blancs — geologically linked by the Paris Basin, which runs under the English Channel — the rolling grassland, ancient woodland and white cliffs between Hampshire and Sussex counties in southeast England encompass not only part of Britain’s newest national park, but also a burgeoning wine region. And rising temperatures have been working in its favor.\nPhoto A bottle of Nutbourne’s Bacchus wine.

Their Rathfinny Estate ( rathfinnyestate.com ) recently opened as England’s largest vineyard.\nWith their Moët & Chandon–trained winemaker, the Drivers plan to produce one million bottles of “world-class” sparkling wine annually (last year, all of Britain released about 4 million) while creating a sustainable, state-of-the-art hub for English wine tourism. From the Rathfinny Trail (a new public footpath that cuts through the valley) to the Flint Barns (the estate’s formerly derelict farmhouse, just opened as an old-meets-new B&B and cafe), it’s a bit of an “If you build it, they will come” scenario.\nA three-hour tour (from £35, about $53 at $1.50 to the pound) took me through poppy-strewn rows of GPS-planted Champagne clones, hand-pruned around steel posts, to the local oak–clad winery. Afternoon tea was served in its tasting room, done up by the Soho House designer Susie Atkinson — though you’ll have to wait until 2017 to try Rathfinny’s sparkling wine. The Drivers are already applying for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, however, to create a standard and a name for Sussex-made bubblies — à la “Champagne.”\nPhoto Dawn light on the vines of the Rathfinny Estate with the village of Alfriston beyond.

The wine’s name invokes the English scientist Christopher Merret, who documented the precursor of the “méthode champenoise” in 1662 — years before Dom Pierre Pérignon started making fizzy wine in France.\nWhether or not the PDO pans out, Sussex has the most vineyards of any county in Britain, with more opening for tasting tours. (Some close for fall harvest, but reopen by spring.) Even Nyetimber ( nyetimber.com ), whose Classic Cuvée blend was served at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and whose medieval West Sussex estate is normally closed to the public, has introduced occasional open days (£20) with guided tastings. Lately, it’s also been touring the country in a 1968 double-decker bus, converted with a copper-and-wood bar and a retractable roof.\nNearby, the young Gladwin brothers, behind London’s buzzy “wild food” restaurants Rabbit and The Shed, just started offering tours (from £25) at their family’s Riesling-focused Nutbourne Vineyards ( nutbournevineyards.com ). Beside its ancient windmill, now a terraced tasting room, they’ll barbecue on old vine trimmings.\nMeanwhile, having helped pioneer wine tourism everywhere from Champagne to South Africa’s Cape during the last three decades, the Hampshire-based Arblaster & Clarke ( winetours.co.uk ) has begun operating on home turf. “I have lived and worked in the South Downs for over 20 years now,” said the general manger, Caron Fanshawe.\nShe said she “never imagined” the company would one day offer a South Downs Vineyard Walk alongside its tours in such renowned wine regions.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/travel/18HEADS4/18HEADS4-master180.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/travel/18HEADS1/18HEADS1-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/travel/18HEADS1/18HEADS1-blog427.jpg", "http://ridgeview.co.uk/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/travel/18HEADS4/18HEADS4-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:03:01.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
