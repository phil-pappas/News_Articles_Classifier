Sorting through choices can feel like a minefield, and open days provide an opportunity to get to the heart of whether a university is right for you. So, here are some tips to help you get the most out of open days: Speak to students Remember that universities are selling themselves to you as much as you are selling yourself to them. Sample lectures, accommodation tours and talks from departmental heads are all great, but ultimately they will be showing you the best of everything. Students are the people who will give you an honest account. If they are enjoying their experience, they will share their enthusiasm – but also any misgivings. Talk to student volunteers leading tours, manning information posts or marshalling bus queues, as well as those in any accommodation you might be shown. Try to focus on the realities of life, not just social opportunities. Make sure you see accommodation If there is accommodation to look at, great. Do your research and view halls in your price bracket. If there isn’t, head to a few halls anyway – you can at least check locations and facilities. Talk to student volunteers leading tours Check out the surrounding area Regardless of your course, you will be spending a significant amount of time in the local area. The campus and accommodation might be top-notch, but the surroundings may not be so inspiring. Where do people rent in the second and third years? Get contact details and web addresses of agents. Walk around the town or city centre to get a feel of it. You may be spending the next three years of your life here, so ignore it at your peril. Attend a sample lecture Now more than ever, going to university is an investment, and that means the learning experience is of paramount importance. Lectures are completely different from classroom learning and you should sample some before deciding on a university. If it feels wrong, maybe that’s a sign to look for a course with more seminars or to re‑evaluate your subject choice. Find out what student union and sports facilities there really are University websites might talk about amazing facilities and services, but in reality these can turn out to be some underwhelming bars and sports grounds that are half an hour away. Unless you intend to get involved in student politics, it is the union’s social and study facilities that provide the real benefits. Find out about a university's sport facilities Photo: Alamy Key questions to ask Forget about trivia such as cleaning arrangements in halls and what time the clubs close. Instead you should ask ... • How many academic contact hours will there be in an average week? Will there be much small-group or one-to-one time? • How will I be assessed, and how detailed is the feedback? • What careers support is there? • How accessible are academic staff? • What are popular career destinations from my course? • Where will most of my working time be spent in the first year, and therefore … • Where would be the most sensible place to live for someone studying my subject? • What are the transport links like? And how much will it cost? • What is the rental market like (for accommodation in the second and third years)? • How can I make my application stand out? What about graduates? Graduate needs are different from those of undergraduates. The social offerings are less important, with quiet halls, good study facilities and top-class academic staff being high on the agenda. • Talk to academic staff about your specific interests to ensure the course and staff are the right fit. • Check out postgraduate-only halls and study facilities. • Ask about the specifics of the course structure and assessment methods. • Find out about postgraduate career support. • Talk to current post-grads. • Find out about scholarships, grants and any potential extra costs. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:37:39.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
