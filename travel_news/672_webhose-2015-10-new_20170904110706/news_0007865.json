More than 500 balloons representing dozens of states and nearly 20 different countries are registered this year.\n\nApproximately 60 balloons launched from Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, as part of Albuquerque Aloft, an event that happens the day before the official Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta event on Saturday. Many pilots who are registered for Balloon Fiesta sign up to participate in Albuquerque Aloft. Pilots tether or launch their balloons from selected school grounds in Albuquerque and Rio Rancho on the Friday morning before Balloon Fiesta. (Clyde Mueller/Santa Fe New Mexican via AP) \nOrganizers say it's one of the most photographed events in the world.\nShelby Burby of Michigan travelled to the fiesta with family members for her father's 80th birthday and they were planning to lift off early Saturday. She described seeing the balloons lift off at sunrise as gorgeous.\nA combination of factors makes Albuquerque the perfect place for fiesta: typically clear skies; cool mornings; and the wind patterns at various elevations that help keep the balloons aloft over the city.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:39:23.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
