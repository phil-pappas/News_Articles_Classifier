To date, TreadRight has supported more than 35 sustainable tourism projects worldwide.” The second award will honour Tusk Trust: “in recognition of its mission to initiate and fund wildlife conservation, community development and environmental education programs across Africa as the charity celebrates its 25th anniversary this year.” The third award will honour Wildscreen: “in recognition of its mission to encourage everyone to experience the natural world and help to protect it. Wildscreen convenes the world’s best photographers and filmmakers with conservationists, creating the most compelling stories about the natural world.” The Award itself, Inspire, was specially designed and handcrafted on the Mediterranean Island of Malta by Mdina Glass, and celebrates the qualities of leadership and vision which inspire others to reach new heights.
