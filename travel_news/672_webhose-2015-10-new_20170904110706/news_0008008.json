The research, published today, reveals that nearly 200,000 graduates from the 2013/14 cohort are currently working in the UK, 76.6 per cent of the total number, up from 75.6 per cent last year. Unemployment also fell during the last 12 months, going from 7.3 per cent in 2012/13, to 6.3 per cent for the most recent figures. While graduate unemployment rates are yet to match pre-recession levels, the report suggests that conditions have improved in the job market, with the number of graduates entering careers at a \"professional level\" also on the rise. According to the data, 68.2 per cent of working graduates are in professional roles that require a degree, nearly 2 per cent higher than 2014. However, the report 'What do graduates do?' - which analyses the post-university destinations of UK students - also revealed striking differences in employment rates for undergraduate degrees. According to figures detailed in the study, graduates in civil engineering have one of the highest rates of full-time employment six months after graduation, with 70 per cent landing a job. This rises to 78.7 per cent when taking into account students who have gone into further study. This is compared with fine arts and media graduates who have some of the lowest rates of those in full-time work or further study. Figures suggest just 51.2 per cent of fine art graduates are in full-time work or further study following graduation, with similar figures of 57.2 per cent and 59.7 per cent for performing arts and media studies graduates. However, the data should be treated with caution. For example, while full-time employment rates look low for graduates in physics and biology, many go on to further study following the first degree. The report also revealed unemployment rates for different degree areas, with computer science graduates facing the highest rates (11.4 per cent) six months after leaving university. This is compared with sports science graduates, who have the lowest rate of unemployment across all degree subjects analysed, at 4.3 per cent. The report, published today by Prospects - a leading graduate careers expert - also revealed the sectors that graduates had entered after leaving university. While computer science graduates have some of the highest unemployment - and employment rates - they are also some of the most likely to enter a career related to their degree subject. According to the data, of the computer science graduates in full-time employment, 58.8 per cent gained roles in the information technology sector. This is compared with nearly a quarter of media studies graduates who found jobs in retail, catering and bar work. The report reveals the disparity in employment outcomes among graduates; highlighting which degrees are more likely to lead to a career in the area of study.

They will still have to work hard to get the jobs they want.\" Eluned Jones, director of student employability at the University of Birmingham, said: \"It's encouraging to see this continued rise in graduate employability and we especially welcome the strong outcomes in students gaining graduate-level employment. \"This demonstrates the commitment of everyone working towards the employability agenda in universities, including careers services, students, academics, professional services and employers - all of whom play a vital part in this journey\". telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:31:43.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
