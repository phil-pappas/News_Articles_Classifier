Catch the show online here: www.cnn.com/journeys .\n(CNN) It's been influencing global cuisine for centuries, but Peru's culinary scene is finally getting the attention it deserves.\nAnd for foodies, it's a destination worth checking out.\nSince pre-Columbian times, ingredients have been sourced everywhere from the lofty heights of the Andes to the depths of the Pacific ocean and the eastern Amazon region.\nBesides taking inspiration from the Incas, Peru's modern-day cuisine features influences from Japan, China, Italy and Spain.\nAnd while Lima's top restaurants such as Central and Maido serve up some of the world's finest fare, you don't have to pay through the nose to sample fantastic cuisine laden with flavor and texture.\nRead More Street food also pulls rank in Peru, with tiny carts specializing in dishes such as hard-boiled quail eggs doused in hot sauce, cebiche, pork crackling sandwiches and anticucho beef heart skewers ensuring taste buds are tempted at every crossroads.\nNot sure where to begin? Here are nine of the country's most popular foods to get you started.\nCebiche\nIndisputably Peru's flagship dish, visitors can try this versatile cured raw fish classic pretty much anywhere in the country, from humble huarique street carts to fancy restaurants.\nTaking full advantage of an extensive 1,500-mile coastline, cooks marinade fresh seafood such as sand smelt, sea bass, tuna, octopus, sole, black clams or sea urchin in lime juice before turning up the heat by adding limo or rocoto chillies.\nSeafood bathes in this spicy yet creamy concoction, called leche de tigre (tiger's milk), for a few hours: it's even said to cure hangovers.\nFine slivers of red onion, sweet potato, cancha crunchy corn and cilantro balance out the acidity in this heavenly, fresh dish.\nWhere to try it: Prepare for a show before tucking into the cebiche at Chez Wong . Owner/chef Javier Wong fillets whole fish with a huge blade like he's slicing through butter.\nChez Wong , Calle Enrique Leon Garcia 114, Lima Peru;\nAnticuchos\nThe quintessential Peruvian street food.\nBeef heart is seasoned with a garlic, cumin, panca chili and vinegar adobo, then slapped on a brazier like a shish kabob.\nSucculent, tender and zinging with flavor, when Peruvians find a preferred purveyor of this filling and hearty snack, they'll line up as long as it takes to get their hands on it.\nAnticuchos are usually served with boiled potatoes and corn on the cob.\nIt's also worth looking out for mollejas de pollo (chicken sweetbreads) and chinchulines (tripe) anticuchos.\nWhere to try it: La Tía Grimanesa -- which started out as a huarique (food cart) but now has a fixed abode in Miraflores -- is a benchmark for Lima's traditional anticuchos.\nLa Tia Tomasa , Av. Nicolas de Pierola 103 Barranco Av. Grau 1002 Barranco, Lima Lima 04 Peru;\nNikkei cuisine\nMaido's take on Nikkei cuisine is widely regarded as the best in Lima. When two peoples as passionate about food as Peruvians and Japanese are come together, the only possible outcome is a culinary firework display of epic proportions.\nThe prominent Japanese migration to Peru in the early 20th century spawned Nikkei, which blends Japanese culinary techniques with Peruvian ingredients, fusing the best of both worlds.\nAn exciting and refreshing cuisine comprising many hybrid dishes, standouts include tiradito, a mixture of sashimi and cebiche, and pulpo al olivo, octopus drenched in a vibrant olive sauce.\nWhere to try it: Peru-born chef Mitsuharu Tsumura has given Nikkei the haute cuisine treatment at Maido : his glorious 15-step tasting menu earned him a spot on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list in 2015.\nMaido , Calle San Martin 399, Miraflores (esquina con Calle Colón), Lima Lima 18 Peru;\nQuinua\nA food staple that's formed part of Peru's diet since pre-Hispanic times, this grain crop is considered so beneficial the United Nations named 2013 International Quinoa Year.\nHighly versatile and revered by people with celiac disease given that it's a tasty substitute for wheat, this superfood grows in the Puna and Andean regions, finding its way into any number of dishes such as tamales, soup, picante de quinua stew, and solterito salad.\nWhere to try it: For a taste of the Andes in Peru's capital, San Ceferino serves up paiche fish skewers with tacu-tacu, replacing rice with quinoa.\nCentral's Virgilio Martínez also uses it in his Mater Elevation tasting menu.\nSan Ceferino , Av. Dos de Mayo 793, San Isidro, Lima Peru;\nCentral Restaurante , Calle Santa Isabel 376 Miraflores, Lima LIMA 18 Peru;\nSanguche de chicharron\nA fast-food staple for Peruvians at any time of day, the perfect pork crackling sandwich is deemed both succulent and crunchy in one mouthful.\nEach sangucheria has its own secret method of preparation, starting with the meat -- some might boil up ribs before sealing flavors in a frying pan, for example.\nThe bread itself is of equal importance: some like a soft bun while others prefer a baguette.\nIt's usually topped with homemade salsa criolla, a combination of Peru's ubiquitous lime juice, yellow chilies, red onions, white vinegar and cilantro.\nTasty sandwich alternatives include sanguche de pavo (turkey) and another Peruvian classic, butifarra, which is made with jamon del pais (ham).\nWhere to try it: El Chinito is a family-run sangucheria that's been whipping out mouthwatering sandwiches for 55 years.\nEl Chinito , Jiron Chancay 894 Cercado de Lima, Lima Peru;\nCuy chactado (deep-fried guinea pig)\nDon't knock it till you've tried it -- deep-fried guinea pig is delicious. While chicken or beef is farmed in the northern hemisphere, guinea pig (cuy) is traditionally consumed in Peru's Andean region.\nEaten before, during and after the Inca period, this is a low-fat, nutritious meat that you might actually enjoy.\nWhile a single cuy won't exactly feed a family of four at Sunday lunch, there's ample meat for a decent starter.\nDeep-fried whole -- cuy chactado -- is a popular way of serving this rodent, which tastes similar to rabbit. You can eat it with your hands, much like eating a chicken drumstick.\nWhere to try it: If you can't get to the Cuzco region, book a table early at Gaston Acurio's Tanta restaurant , as cuy sells out fast. Maido also crosses into Andean territory, serving up cuy confit.\nTanta , Av. 28 de Julio 888, Miraflores Larcomar Shopping Miraflores, Lima Peru;\nMaido , Calle San Martin 399, Miraflores (esquina con Calle Colón), Lima Lima 18 Peru;\nCausa rellena con pollo\nTaking advantage of the Andean nation's 4,000-plus varieties of tubers, causas is a classic supporting cast member to cebiche.\nAnother dish dating back to pre-Colombian times, causa was traditionally made by mashing yellow potatoes with chili.\nThese days, lime juice is added to the mix for extra zing.\nRather like a sandwich where potato substitutes bread, causas are filled with chicken or tuna salad and topped with mayonnaise.\nServed cold, this colorful, starchy food tower is perfect for mopping up leche de tigre juice.\nWhere to try it: The causa limena at La Mar Cebicheria in Miraflores neighborhood is made with avocado, chicken, boiled egg and tomato.\nLa Mar , Av. La Mar 770 Miraflores, Lima Peru;\nPicarones\nEven better than donuts. In need of a sugary pick-me-up? These donut-like rings are fried up freshly in front of you from huarique food carts and served hot.\nBut picarones are no ordinary donuts.\nMade from sweet potatoes and a large green squash called zapallo macre, they are also spiced with aniseed and cinnamon then drizzled with fig, passion fruit or sugar cane syrup -- a deliciously exotic combination that beats the pants off lesser fried dough rings.\nWhere to try it: There are huariques dedicated to making picarones under the Bridge of Sighs (Puente de los Suspiros) in Lima's Barranco neighborhood.\nBarranco , Barranco District, Lima Peru;\nSuspiro de limena\nThis dessert's name translates as \"the lady from Lima's sigh.\"\nA double-layered treat you'll likely want to share given its exorbitant high sugar content, suspiro a la limena's gooey base is made from manjar blanco caramel (also known as dulce de leche) then draped with port-infused meringue and a sprinkle of cinnamon.\nFruitier versions are enhanced by chirimoya (custard apple) and lucuma egg fruit that's native to the Andean region.\nWhere to try it: You'll gasp with pleasure or pain depending on your sugar tolerance after your first bite at Dolce Capriccio in Lima's Miraflores neighborhood.\nDolce Capriccio , 701 Calle Dos de Mayo, Miraflores (Altura de la Cuadra 7 de la Av. Pardo), Lima Peru;", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015160148-guinea-pig-medium-plus-169.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/ChezJavierWong", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015164803-8-peru-food-picarones-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150924124634-5-maido-small-11.jpg", "http://centralrestaurante.com.pe/en/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150924124634-5-maido-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015164803-8-peru-food-picarones-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015164803-8-peru-food-picarones-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150924124634-5-maido-super-169.jpg", "http://www.maido.pe/", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d779051-Reviews-m14631-La_Mar-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150924124634-5-maido-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://www.elchinito.com.pe/", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d3183987-Reviews-m14631-Dolce_Capriccio-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015160148-guinea-pig-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d6904656-Reviews-m14631-La_Tia_Tomasa-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "https://www.facebook.com/Anticuchos-de-la-Tia-Grimanesa-113530488761927/timeline/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015160148-guinea-pig-large-169.jpg", "http://www.restaurantsanceferino.com/", "http://www.lamarcebicheria.com/lima/", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d782626-Reviews-m14631-Tanta-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150924124634-5-maido-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015164803-8-peru-food-picarones-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d779057-Reviews-m14631-San_Ceferino-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015160148-guinea-pig-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015164803-8-peru-food-picarones-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015164803-8-peru-food-picarones-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150924124634-5-maido-full-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d1759465-Reviews-m14631-Maido-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d3308283-Reviews-m14631-El_Chinito-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d1122198-Reviews-m14631-Chez_Wong-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g294316-d548265-Reviews-m14631-Barranco-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294316-d1798176-Reviews-m14631-Central_Restaurante-Lima_Lima_Region.html", "http://www.capriccio.com.pe/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015164803-8-peru-food-picarones-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150924124634-5-maido-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015160148-guinea-pig-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015160148-guinea-pig-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151015160148-guinea-pig-small-11.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:54:03.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
