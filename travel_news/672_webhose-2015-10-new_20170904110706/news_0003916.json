A unique way to celebrate is to take an air tour of the Grand Canyon that departs from Vegas or Arizona. You can take a helicopter tour or an airplane tour and customize your tour package with a variety of options. You're sure to find a tour filled with fun things to do that fits right into your budget. The Best Helicopter Air Tours Flights run all year around, except for Christmas Day, so you don't need to worry about special schedules over Halloween. If you want to begin your tour in Nevada, you can depart from Henderson, Boulder City, or the Strip in Vegas. If the South Rim at Arizona is more convenient for you, then you can fly from the town of Tusayan, which is right at the gates   The great thing about flying from Vegas is that there are landing tours available. The air-only tours are thrilling, but the landing tours let you see the canyon up close and personal as well as from the air. The West Rim landing tours land on the Canyon floor, on top of the rim, or a combination of both. If you go to the bottom of the Canyon, you can enjoy a champagne picnic or even a boat ride along the Colorado River, and if you go to the top of the rim, you can experience   The Skywalk is a stunning glass and metal platform which sits almost 4000ft above the bottom of the Canyon. You will feel as if you're walking on air when you step out onto the platform. Tickets to the Skywalk can be included in your West Rim flight package. The flights that depart from Arizona aren't allowed to land on the Canyon, but they make up for it in the beautiful scenery you'll see on a tour. There are two choices in the tours based on the amount of flight time they offer. One tour lasts about a half an hour, while the second tour is nearly an hour long. The longer tour is the better option since you get to fly to the North Rim as well as the eastern edge of the park. In all, the longer tour covers about 3/4 of the national park, and it is one of the most comprehensive tours available. The Deluxe Tour Upgrade You can book a basic or deluxe air tour of the Grand Canyon. Basic tickets offer fantastic views, albeit inside slightly older helicopters. The aircraft are safe and provide nice views, but they are not considered state-of-the art for sightseeing today. The deluxe tours are a little different and they offer the best experience. These fly on EcoStar 130 helicopters. They have roomier cabins and you'll be a lot more comfortable during your tour. They have a massive windscreen for the ultimate in panoramic views, plus, the seats are arranged so there is no bad seat with obstructed views. If you choose deluxe in Vegas, then you will fly from the Strip and receive a limousine shuttle service. The basic tours depart from the suburbs and you'll need to take a shuttle bus to the helipad. Touring By Airplane You could tour by airplane instead, and if you choose a plane tour of the South Rim, your airplane will follow the same route as the tour helicopters. The difference with these tours is that they fly higher than helicopters, so the view you get isn't as close. Plane tours are fun and scenic though, and they are the perfect option if you're touring with a group because an airplane can hold up to 19 people per flight. Also, the plane tours cost less, so that's a good choice when you need to control your vacation budget. Wrapping Up So, which tour sounds like fun? A basic tour or a deluxe upgrade? Airplane or helicopter? Do you want to see the South Rim or the West Rim? You'll have plenty of options and choices to make. Start with choosing your departure city and then pick out the most upgrades you can afford. Think of the memories you'll make if you book a champagne tour of the West Rim. Since Halloween is almost here, you need to book your tour now. Be sure to book your tour online too, because you'll get a great discount that way, plus you'll have a lot of variety in tour options to ensure you create a Halloween tour you'll never forget. \nAuthor Lea Fallon is an expert on the Grand Canyon and recommends these airplane tours and these helicopter rides: http://www.grandcanyondaytrips.com/helicopters/   20   50  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:13:58.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
