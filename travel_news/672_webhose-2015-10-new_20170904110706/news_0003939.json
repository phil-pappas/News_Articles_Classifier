No storage function troubles both consumers and Fosjoas R&D team.Different from other Fosjoas electric scooters, the most outstanding advantage of K3 is comfortable and stable sitting-posture riding mode. However, compared with private cars and motorcycles, Fosjoas K3 have several irreplaceable superiorities. The adopted aerospace attitude control theory, fuzzy software algorithm and gyroscope system pave the way for relaxing and free riding. Users can realize all controls by mildly changing body gravity. For example, leaning forward means speeding up, while leaning backward means slowing down. The reason why Fosjoas K3 can sensor what owner wants to do largely benefits from the built-in advanced intelligent chip. Besides, Fosjoas K3 is powered by clean electricity and only takes 2KWH every 100km, which caters for the goal of green and energy-saving travel mode. However, Fosjoas K3 sitting-posture self-balancing scooter still has a shortcoming: it has no storage box. No storage function troubles not only consumers, but also Fosjoas R&D team. It will be perfect if Fosjoas K3 is equipped with a storage box. On the basis of high-quality materials, the maximum loading capacity is as heavy as 120kg. That is to say, Fosjoas K3 has enough capability to carry goods. However, adding storage function is not a piece of cake. It needs diligent study of Fosjoas technicians and, finally, will be realized in the future. The storage function of Fosjoas K3 is helpful to expand its application field and consumer base. Many people would like to ride Fosjoas K3 electric scooter to work, to go to school or even to take a trip. Because of no storage box, they have to carry the backpack, which will harm the back muscles and backbone if riding for a long time. Such a problem will be thoroughly solved if storage box is installed. Whatâ€™s more, the storage function may be extended to other types of Fosjoas electric scooters. At that time, Fosjoas will be the leader in transport world. About: Fosjoas Technology Co.,Ltd was founded by UK Moben Global Inc. in 2010.
