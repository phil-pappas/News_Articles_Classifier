Johnson"], "text": "San Miguel de Allende’s restaurant scene reached critical mass and global acclaim when celebrity chef Enrique Olvera opened Moxi in 2012. It followed hot on the heels of the five-star Rosewood resort, which debuted just around the corner.\nOlvera is Mexico’s most famous chef. His flagship in Mexico City is called Pujol. His arrival in San Miguel cemented the colonial town’s reputation as having one of the best farm-to-table restaurant scenes in all of Mexico.\nAnd that’s great. I’ve been renting a house in San Miguel just about every other year for the past 15 years, and I’ve enjoyed watching the restaurant scene blossom.\nBut one of the main reasons I come to San Miguel is for the street food.\nThis is one of the safest places in Mexico to enjoy clean, delicious street food: tacos, corn, tortas, birria, hand-churned ice cream and churros.\nSo, you could (and probably should) visit Olvera’s Moxi or Rosewood’s 1886, but you definitely don’t want to miss the local street food, which will never cost more than a few bucks for an entire meal or a few pesos for a quick snack.\nHere are some of my favorite old haunts in and around the historic core known as Centro Historico.\nThe starting lineup \nThe first thing I do whenever I get to town is stock the fridge and pantry, which always involves a pile of carnitas, a couple of chickens and a kilo of coffee. Go to Carnitas Hernandez on the corner of Puente Guanajuato and Umaran. Get there early to nab the best pork. While you’re there, pick up some chicharrones (fried pig skin).\nJust across the river from here, on Guadalupe Street, is Pollo Feliz, the busiest mesquite-grilled chicken stand in San Miguel. Be prepared to wait extra long on Wednesdays, when they give you an extra half of a chicken with every whole bird.\nNext stop is La Ventana for coffee. The beans come directly from Chiapas and are roasted locally. Look for the walk-up window on Diez de Sollano, half a block from the central jardin (the downtown square; here they call it jardin, not zocolo).\nTacos al pastor \nThe vendor in El Centro with some of the best tacos al pastor has forever set up shop at the corner of Mesones and Pepe Llanos, directly behind the huge Church of Jesus of Nazareth. Like clockwork, as soon as the sun goes down, this place pops up. Spicy marinated pork is skewered onto a large vertical rotisserie, then sliced to order from the spit and served with pineapple and grilled onions. In years past, it used to have a few stools, but those encouraged people to linger too long, so now it’s standing-room-only in the middle of the street.\nBut as good as these tacos are, they are not technically the town’s best.\nThose can be found on Taco Highway, or Calzada de la Estacion, which is the road to the bus station and the way toward Leon. It’s almost a mile from Centro, but it’s a breeze if you’ve rented a car or ATV.\nFrom the jardin in Centro, take Calle de Canal down the hill and across the river and keep going. Calle de Canal becomes Calzada de la Estacion, where you’ll soon see a quarter-mile stretch that is filled with taquerias, all peddling pretty much the same thing. One spot, though, is always slightly busier than the others: It’s called Taqueria Gonzalez, and it is a couple doors down from the bus station, adjacent to a mechanics garage. These are hands down the best tacos al pastor in San Miguel. They actually offer table service inside the bare cinderblock garage and under a makeshift canvas tent.\nTaco Corner \nThe corner of Ancha de San Antonio (the old highway that runs through Centro) and Nemesio Diez (also called Paseo del Parque, the street that leads from the highway to Benito Juarez Park) has long been known to locals as Taco Corner. Various vendors park their mobile kitchens here throughout the day.\nIn the mornings, the corner also welcomes flower vendors selling freshly cut lilies, daffodils, sunflowers and carnations. Food sellers come and go throughout the day, and in the heat of afternoon the corner often goes quiet. But come nightfall, a taco vendor known as El Deudas almost always shows up. You can smell the sizzling carne asada and beef tongue from a block away.\nIce cream surprises \nIt hasn’t always been the case, but these days there’s an ice cream vendor on every corner. Many of them are good, but my favorite, and one of the oldest, is on Calle Insurgentes where Insurgentes becomes Pepe Llanos, one block northwest of the big Jesus of Nazareth Church. The ice cream is churned by hand every day.\nExcept for the most basic flavors like vanilla, chocolate or strawberry, the selection changes constantly to include surprises like tuna (the sweet red fruit of prickly pear cactus), tamarind, goat-milk caramel and even tequila.\nThe better corn \nYou’ll see corn venders everywhere. Around the jardin, they sell the typical boiled corn that’s dusted with cheese and chili powder. Skip that.\nWalk a few blocks southwest to the corner of Pila de Seca (also known as Cuadrante) and Zacateros (also known as Ancha de San Antonio). Here you will always find the same old woman sitting on the curb, fanning a charcoal grill, which is always loaded with corn that slowly morphs from yellow to black as it cooks. It doesn’t need cheese or chili powder. It’s perfect just the way it is.\nHead to the market \nIn the northeastern fringe of Centro, adjacent to the arts and crafts fair, is the city’s oldest green market, Ignacio Ramirez Mercado, where locals come to buy produce from local farmers, meat from local butchers, and freshly pressed tortillas. Deep inside this bazaar, toward the back, you’ll find a collection of food stalls, each with only a handful of seats.\nTwo in particular stand out: Los Farolitos, which makes wonderful Milanese tortas, and Fonda Doña Reyes (which encompasses the adjacent Birrieria 71), where Mrs. Reyes serves incredible roasted goat and chicken soup. Ask her to show you her secret salsas.\nOn your way out, notice the churro vendors on the sidewalk. These churros cost pennies apiece, and they’re almost as good as the $2 churros served at the famed San Augustin cafe down the street.\nEven more tortas \nOne block from the mercado, across the street from Jesus of Nazareth, is a hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop called Tortitlan. There are a couple of other locations, but this is the newest branch. It offers three dozen Mexican sandwiches, and it’s difficult to discern the differences among many of them. I prefer the cemitas poblano with fried beef and string cheese.\nIf, after all that, you still have time for a fancy restaurant, consider Olvera’s Moxi. You’ll feel like you’re a million miles away from the streets.\nContact the writer: bajohnson@ocregister.com or on Instagram: @bradajohnson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:26:09.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
