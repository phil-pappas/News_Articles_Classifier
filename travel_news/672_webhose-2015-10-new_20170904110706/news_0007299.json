But for Broncos kicker Brandon McManus, the game has been one of inches. Not yards.\nOver the summer, McManus altered his technique to not only improve his consistency, but also regain the trust from Broncos coaches after his erratic first year when he connected on only 69.2 percent of his field-goal attempts. With extra points now the distance of most field goals, the change has helped him in more ways than one.\n\"I basically was a two-and-a-half-step field-goal kicker, so I would take a jab step, kind of a six-inch step with my left foot. I completely removed that,\" McManus said. \"I'm starting from my left foot pushing off, and it allows me to make sure I'm in the same spot every time when I take my plant step. That jab step could be six inches, could be seven inches, could be eight inches, but that one inch my plant foot is off could affect the accuracy.\"\nThrough five games, McManus has been 1-A to the Broncos' defense in leading the team to a 5-0 record. He's transformed from a twice-waived player into an invaluable asset. On a team where points have been scarce, his consistency and leg strength have often saved the Broncos' offense.\nAdvertisement Twice Denver has won without an offensive touchdown, putting the onus on McManus' leg and the defense's reads. Against Minnesota, a kick by McManus was the game-deciding score. He' has scored 47 of the Broncos' 113 points to tie for the league's second-largest scoring total by a kicker, and has made four kicks from 50 yards or farther.\nWhile many kickers around the league have lacked consistency, McManus has been perfect, going 12-of-12 on field-goal attempts and11-of-11 on extra points.\n\"Best kicker in the league,\" said Broncos running back Kapri Bibbs.\nKickers have converted 95.1 percent (347 of 365) of their extra-point attempts. Uunder the rules of 2014, they made 99.3 percent (1,220 of 1,230). They've made made 83.1 percent of their field-goal attempts, down from 84 percent in 2014.\nWeek 4 was marred with missed attempts, including a 38-yarder by Minnesota's Blair Walsh in the second quarter against the Broncos. Sunday at Oakland McManus kicked four field goals in a six-point Broncos' victory. Raiders veteran Sebastian Janikowski missed a 40-yard attempt and saw his 38-yard attempt blocked.\nNFL kickers missed seven game-tying or winning field-goal attempts last season. They've already missed four this season.\nGet sports news and updates right in your inbox Sign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.\n\"McManus has been the special teams MVP in four out of five games,\" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. \"That's a good thing. He's kicking extremely well. Not only on his field goals, which speak for themselves, but he's been kicking off well, too.\"\nAlso better than last season.\nMcManus has taken all 28 kickoffs for the Broncos, putting opponents, on average, at the 20-yard line. And he's improved his touchback percentage to 78.6 percent, up from 70.3 percent.\n\"He's just kicking great,\" Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning said. \"He's doing well on kickoffs. He's kicking with a lot of confidence. He's doing a heck of a job, and I'm really glad he's on our team.\"\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "external_links": ["http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-15T10:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:05:44.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
