Picture: Justine Hong\nLydia Schrandt news.com.au BALI is so famous for its stunning natural beauty and rich culture that even mentioning the name conjures up images of a tropical paradise found.\nThe reality is just as good as the dream, especially at these nine often overlooked yet breathtaking spots within.\n1. Mount Batur\nMount Batur, one of Bali’s most sacred volcanic peaks, has quickly become one of the island’s top attractions for outdoors enthusiasts who come in the early hours of the morning to make the climb to the summit to watch the sunrise over the lake below.\nThose who’d like to take in the majestic beauty of the volcano in a more relaxed way will find natural hot springs on the banks of Lake Batur.\nPeace at Mount Batur.

It’s also one of Bali’s most important directional temples, built during the eleventh century to give protection to the locals.\nPlan your visit for the late afternoon, so you can tour the temple grounds and then catch a traditional Balinese dance performance after sunset.\n3. Rice terraces of Ubud\nFar from the beaches of the coast, Bali’s interior displays a different kind of beauty. Explore the area surrounding Ubud, and you’ll notice a landscape dominated by lush, green terraced rice paddies.\nSadly, it’s a sight most visitors miss out on in lieu of the beach.\nThe dramatic wavelike tiers of the Tegallalang rice terraces north of Ubud.

Towering 3142 metres above sea level, the volcanic peak of Agung is believed to be the abode of a local deity, and is also where you’ll find Besakih, Bali’s Mother Temple.\nThe challenging ascent from Besakih to the highest point on the mountain typically takes more than six hours.\n5. Tanah Lot\nTanah Lot, another of Bali’s picturesque directional temples, sits on a rocky outcropping just off the beach and is the region’s most visited — and photographed — temple. While foreign visitors aren’t allowed inside, it’s possible to walk over to see the rocky island close up during low tide.\nTanah Lot. Picture: Alex Hanoko\n6. Ulun Danu\nOne of Bali’s most beautiful inland temples sits on the banks of Lake Bratan. Built in 1633, Ulun Danu Temple is made up of several thatch-roofed shrines surrounded by flower-filled gardens.\nIt’s especially beautiful when viewed from a boat on the lake itself. If you’re staying on the beaches of south Bali, it’s possible to visit this lakeside temple on a day trip inland.\n7. Dreamland Beach\nIf you’re in Bali to surf, chances are Dreamland Beach sits somewhere on your vacation to-do list. Located near Uluwatu, Dreamland’s offshore break makes it one of the island’s top surf spots, while the long stretch of golden sand earns it a spot among Bali’s most beautiful beaches.\nDreamland Beach is dreamy.

Kuta Beach\nMost people don’t consider Bali’s most popular surfing beach — Kuta — all that beautiful due to the heavy crowds, pesky touts and rapid development. Beaches like this don’t become so crowded without reason, and come sunset, you’ll see just why Kuta ranks among Bali’s beautiful places.\nThe long expanse of sand feels festive come dusk when tourists and locals alike come here to watch the sun sink into the ocean.\n9. Sekumpul Waterfall\nWhile Bali has several waterfalls, Sekumpul on the north side of the island is one of the most photogenic. The tall, elegant falls cascade down a lush, greenery-covered cliff some 80m — well worth the effort of driving across the island and hiking into the relatively unspoilt jungles.\nThe towering waterfall.
