This also paves the way for driverless cars.\nAll of these things can enhance the driving (or, as the case may be, non-driving) experience; and all are focused on taking control out of human hands and putting highly advanced machines in charge. Yet, even as this machine-driven future fast approaches, the ability to quickly assimilate and analyze Big Data is also providing new ways for humans to take more control over their on-road experience.\nOne of those ways is Waze, which is now the world's largest crowdsourced traffic and navigation app, with more than million users in countries. Waze users share real-time roadway and traffic information with the Waze network and each other.\nBy connecting drivers to one another, Waze is creating local driving communities that work together to improve road experiences by helping users avoid accidents, sidestep traffic jams, find the best prices on gasoline, avoid traffic tickets, and find deals at local stores. Waze, which was launched in Israel , as a competitor to Google Maps and Apple Maps, has so much to offer that Google-whose Google Maps application is the leading traffic and navigation app, and the sixth most widely used smartphone app3 -paid $ billion to acquire Waze in June 2013 .\nHowever, some of the very capabilities that make Waze the most feature-rich, interactive traffic and navigation app also raise questions about its impacts on privacy, law enforcement, and its coexistence with Google Maps. This Stratecast SPIE report discusses key capabilities and benefits of the Waze app, and analyzes those impacts\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3113621/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/googles-waze-crowdsourced-traffic-and-navigation-app-is-a-hit-but-how-does-it-impact-privacy-the-lawand-google-maps-300153228.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR18053&Transmission_Id=201510012240PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR18053&DateId=20151001", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3113621/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/googles-waze-crowdsourced-traffic-and-navigation-app-is-a-hit-but-how-does-it-impact-privacy-the-lawand-google-maps-300153228.html", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:31:13.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
