Photograph by: Ryan Remiorz , The Canadian Press \nREGINA - In its latest series of concerts for children, the Regina Symphony Orchestra is teaming up with the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame to present \"The Hockey Sweater,\" an orchestral adaptation of Roch Carrier's iconic short story . \nOn Dec. 6, for the show's Regina premiere performance at Knox Metropolitan Church, the hall of fame — about two blocks away — is offering pre-concert games and activities for audience members. \nOriginally commissioned by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, National Arts Centre Orchestra and the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, the work has been performed by orchestras across the country. \n\"When we wanted to launch 'The Hockey Sweater' (in Regina) we felt it was a great opportunity to connect both sports and the arts, which is an obvious connection, especially for children,\" said RSO executive director Tanya Derksen. \nThe show, which features an original score by Canadian composer Abigail Richardson, will include a narration of Carrier's story by sports broadcaster Warren Woods. As well, Regina Mayor Michael Fougere is set to make a cameo appearance as a hockey player in a \"faceoff against our concertmaster Simon McDonald,\" said Derksen. \nThe hall of fame is currently staging an exhibit on minor hockey in Saskatchewan. \n——— \nOnline: http://reginasymphony.com/concerts/upcoming", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:46:55.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
