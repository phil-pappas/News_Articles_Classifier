The airline will begin four weekly direct flights to Multan and will commence three weekly services to Faisalabad.\nCommenting on Gulf Air’s new route announcement the national carrier’s A/Chief Commercial Officer Mr. Ahmed Janahi said: “We are committed to serving the Pakistan market, as we have done since our first entry in 1960. Accordingly, we are delighted to supplement our existing operations – catering to passenger demand from across the country. Gulf Air affords travelers seamless connectivity via our efficient hub in Bahrain International Airport, linking a number of GCC and European destinations to and from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. I would like to extend our thanks to the Pakistan authorities and Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority for facilitating and supporting this new development that I am confident will be well-received by passengers.”\nTaking our total Pakistan destinations up to 07, Faisalabad and Multan will supplement Gulf Air’s current service to five cities in Pakistan: Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, Peshawar and Sialkot. Gulf Air flights to Multan, Pakistan’s 5 th largest city by population, and Faisalabad, a major industrial and manufacturing hub, will be operated by an Airbus A320 aircraft.\nFaisalabad (all times local)\nFlight Number Departure Airport Departure Time Arrival Airport Arrival Time Frequency GF 0790 BAH 00:55 LYP 05:55 TUE, THU, FRI GF 0791 LYP 06:40 BAH 08:40 TUE, THU, FRI Multan (all times local)\nFlight Number Departure Airport Departure Time Arrival Airport Arrival Time Frequency GF 0788 BAH 01:05 MUX 05:45 MON, WED, THU, SAT GF 0789 MUX 06:30 BAH 08:20 MON, WED, THU, SAT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:00:07.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
