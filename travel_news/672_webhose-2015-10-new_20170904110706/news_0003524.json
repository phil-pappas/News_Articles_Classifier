Get ready to get surprised!\nLet’s go to Transnistria – It’s alright if you have not heard of it before! This, almost a wafer-thin breakaway state is situated in a sandwiched position between Ukraine and Moldova. Sadly, neither of them recognises the land and strictly speaking, it is not recognised by anyone – except Transnistrians. It has its own President, its own Parliament; own flag and even its own currency, the Transnistrian rubles. It is an interesting place to visit taking a day off from your (if any,) Moldova-travel itinerary.\nCheap beer – Talking of Maldova, it’s a secret hit-party destination! Why only beer, wine is equally cheap at Moldova than any other kind of drink.\nAnother known place, Shqipëria – Never heard of this as well? Well, there is one common name, Albania. But if you call it by Albania inside the country, the locals might look totally blank. And whilst talking of Albania, there one more thing very unusual (read confusing) about the place. Nodding the head means no and shaking it sidewise means yes.\nWant to be a millionaire – Visit Belarus if you wish to be a millionaire! With 13,000 rubles to the pound, it’s fairly easy to be a millionaire. And, even a student would find their wallet overflowing with vast wad of cash.\nFinding friends – To name the friendliest countries of Europe, Kosovo would be ranked at the top. This is because it has the smoothest cross-border rules and there are even examples where Kosovans offer cakes and sweet things to the passer bys.\nHow to travel – The transport between Romania and Serbia is virtually non-existent which is why you need to plan a detour. Hungary is a good option.\nIstanbul – Through the mighty Strait of Bosphorus, this city has always been one of the most beautiful places to visit and has been bridging the two continents, Asia and Europe equally beautifully for ages.\nLargest and smallest countries – Europe is the home to both the largest and the smallest country in the world. The former being Russia and the later is Vatican City State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:42:25.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
