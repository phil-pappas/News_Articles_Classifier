On the back of major new event contracts, the firm has been reappointed to provide event services for the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI), bulk transport shows Tip-ex and Tank-ex and the Independent Schools’ Bursars Association (IBSA). \nThe company will deliver its full range of event services for the next two annual ACPGBI conferences. The association, which represents professionals specialising in the treatment of bowel diseases, will be staging conferences at EICC, Edinburgh in 2016 and BIC, Bournemouth in 2017. Joe Manby Limited has also been reappointed to work with Road Transport Media on its Tip-ex and Tank-ex shows to be held in Harrogate over the next three years. A renewal of a relationship that dates back to 2007, the shows are the UK’s only exhibitions dedicated to the dry bulk and liquid tanker sector. Held at the Harrogate International Centre the shows fill five halls, spilling out into the surrounding area and attracting more than 3,500 visitors to the town. Finally, the Independent Schools' Bursars Association (ISBA) has reappointed Joe Manby Limited to provide event services for its annual conference staged around the UK for a further four years until 2019. The 2016 event being held over two days in Edinburgh will welcome more than 400 key decision-making bursars and senior management staff from independent schools, along with many of the independent education sector’s leading experts. Richard Manby, Director at Joe Manby Limited said: “We’ve worked with these well respected organisations for many years and we are delighted to have the opportunity to continue these long standing relationships. We pride ourselves on the quality of the service we offer and this is a fantastic endorsement of our consistent approach over many years.” In addition, Joe Manby Limited will provide event services for a new one-day transport event to be launched at Alexander Palace. Freight in the City will showcase the latest vehicles, technology and equipment that enable urban deliveries to be made quietly, cleanly and safely. Vic Bunby, sales director at Road Transport Media commented: “We are delighted to appoint Joe Manby Limited again for our important shows in Harrogate in June 2016. We have really seen the benefits of a high level of service in previous years which is why we have also now appointed the company for our exciting new show in London. Freight in the City takes place on 27 October and we look forward to working with the team.” The new wins follow the Harrogate-based events services company announcing its busiest first quarter - bringing to 35 the number of new events Joe Manby Limited will stage at venues throughout the UK between 2015 and 2016.
