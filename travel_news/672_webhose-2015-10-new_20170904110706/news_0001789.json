The airline offer low fares and something called Premium Flex. Is it worth the extra money? Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer . \n\nAirAsia flies 3 times daily each way between Hong Kong (HKG) Bangkok (DMK). Two fares are offered: Low Fare and Premium Flex. The flight time is 2 hours and 45 minutes. So what's the verdict? \nWhen I decided to attend TBEX Asia, a.k.a. the Travel Bloggers Expo, I needed to book a flight from Hong Kong (where I live) to Bangkok (where the conference would be held). \nAfter checking out the fares (which varied VASTLY), I settled on AirAsia. \nAnd there was another reason that I preferred AirAsia to the other airlines flying the route. \nAs a so-called \"discount carrier\", the airline flew into Bangkok's Don Mueang International Airport (DMK) rather than Bangkok's impossible to pronounce Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK). \nDMK is used mostly for domestic flights and by discount carriers. BKK is used mostly for international flights. \nNot only is DMK less crowded, it is also a mere 10 minutes drive from my friend's house, where I plan to spend my first and final nights in Thailand. \nSo for me it would be significantly more convenient than it might be for other travellers. The distance from downtown Bangkok to DMK is roughly 21 kilometres vs 28 kilometres for BKK. \nSo I am NOT saying DMK would be more convenient for everyone. \nLow Fare vs Premium Flex \nThere were 3 flights and I booked the one leaving at 10.45 am. The Low Fare was HK$550. The Premium Flex fare was HK$1,024, which is nearly double. \nI opted on the more expensive fare because it allowed me to check 20 kilograms of luggage (I hope my Fish Scale is accurate) and I could change the flight time and date for free (unlikely, but this was important. \nAll things considered, I had to cancel my last trip to Bangkok at the last minute because of a slight \"problem\" (if you read the news, you will know what I am talking about), and my money was NOT refundable). \nNot only that, I could book a seat with more leg room. Not all of the other perks were not important to me, but here is the full list ... Time and date can be changed for free; 20 kilogrammes of baggage can be checked for free; There is priority baggage (does that mean it offloads more quickly?); A dedicated check in counter is offered; There is priority check in (same, same, but different?); There is a free meal (I opted for green chicken curry); A seat with more leg room (VERY important to me~!!!) was available. \nThat is what I was told I would get. So what did I REALLY get? Here is my appraisal of the flight ... Yes, the line at Premium Flex WAS much shorter than the line for economy (see the pix below) Yes, I did get to board before the others. No, I didn't have more leg room in the first row as I was promised. I had considerably less. Luckily the plane was only about 1/4th full and I was allowed to move to the 2nd row. The ticket included a meal, which was pretty basic. But it tasted better than it looked. And it was VERY spicy. As airline food goes, it was above average. The amount of water offered was pretty measly. Considering the fare differential, I think they would have thrown in a glass of wine. Yes, my checked bag arrived before I did. Overall, the cabin was very attractive. The seats were covered in leather, with plenty of leg room (unless you select the first row), and very comfortable. But that went for everyone. \nLow Fare Line at Check In Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. \nPremium Flex Line at Check In Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. \nThe Cabin Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. \nWhat Was Promised Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. \nWhat I Got Photo Credit: Accidental Travel Writer. \nSome of the perks were a bit frivolous. Considering the difference in price, I think they could have been a bit more generous with the food and beverage. \nThe main attraction was the checked luggage . \nWould I fly AirAsia again? Absolutely. Overall I was satisfied with the comfort and the service. Would I splash out the extra cash for the flexibility and the perks? \nI'll have to think about it. I was VERY disappointed to discover that the seat that was advertised on the website as having extra leg room actually had LESS leg room than the cheap seats. \nAirAsia is a group of low-cost airlines flying to 100 travel destinations in 22 countries. The airlines have hubs in Bangalore, India; Bangkok, Thailand; Jakarta, Indonesia; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Manila, in the Philippines. \nReturn to Main Page \nTalking Points \nHave you ever flown on AirAsia?
