Together with eight partners, including hotels, agencies and Messe Berlin, the BCO informed potential customers about the latest trends in the German capital.\n“The interest in Berlin remains on a constant high,” says Heike Mahmoud, Director Conventions of the visitBerlin Berlin Convention Office. “The wide range of modern hotel offerings in the city is a popular selling point for our customers and the good value for money is a strong factor driving our success.”\nAccording to the Hotels.com Hotel Price Index 2014, the average price for a night’s stay in a Berlin hotel is €92. This makes the city one of the most affordable destinations in the top 5 of the latest statistics from the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA). In comparison, event participants pay an average of €138 a night in Paris, €103 in Vienna, and €117 in Barcelona. Only Madrid is less expensive than Berlin at €87 a night.\nThis year, it was mainly companies and agencies including professional congress organisers (PCOs) and providers of incentives that came to explore what the German capital has to offer. In addition to North America, customer enquiries at IMEX America also came from attendees from Latin America, Europe and China.\nHalf-year statistics 2015: North America is most important overseas market\nIn the first six months of 2015, 62,000 events took place in the German capital (+1.5% compared to the previous year) with 4.82 million participants (also +1.5%).
