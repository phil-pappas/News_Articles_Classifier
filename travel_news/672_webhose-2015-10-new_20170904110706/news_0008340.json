The award rewards an airport which has had a positive impact on European air transport operations and recognises the importance of airline-airport partnerships.\nThe judging panel of distinguished industry experts from across Europe applauded the airport’s achievements on several accounts. The judges praised Shannon’s ability to attract a second Ryanair aircraft to the airport and the launch of Aer Lingus’ new transatlantic services in 2015, resulting in an increase of 17 per cent in passenger numbers for the year.\nAdditional achievements saw Shannon Airport successfully lead the lobbying of the Irish Government to abolish the country’s passenger tax and reaffirm the important role that the airport plays in the West of Ireland’s rural community.\nPatrick Edmond, Shannon’s group strategy director, received the trophy at ERA’s prestigious awards dinner, held at the vintage car museum in Berlin, Classic Remise, at ERA’s annual General Assembly. He commented: “To win such a prestigious European aviation award is a proud achievement for Shannon, but to win it two years in a row is remarkable. This kind of recognition from our industry peers really validates the hard work of Shannon’s people and inspires us to do more.”\n**The ERA Airport Achievement Award is judged by an independent panel comprising industry experts and respected representatives of the aviation media from across Europe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:59:22.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
