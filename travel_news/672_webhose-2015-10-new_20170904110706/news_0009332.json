If you want the best tour package available, then choose a deluxe tour out of Vegas. Less Than An Hour To The CanyonA side trip is a nice break from the excitement of Vegas since it is just a short 45 minute to the West Rim. Don't forget that Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam are right next to Vegas, so you'll take a flyover of the world's most famous dam on your way to the main attraction. Seeing the West Rim of the canyon is one thing. And seeing it from the air in a helicopter makes it even better. Plus, landing at the canyon so you can explore on foot only adds to the fun. When you take a landing tour to the West Rim, you can opt for a tour package that lands on top of the rim or one that flies down to the canyon floor. If you want to descend to the bottom of the canyon, then the champagne picnic tour is a good one to take. This package will set you down next to the Colorado River, where you can toast to the journey, and the magnificent canyon walls. You can even add on a tour of the river on a boat, and you could even complete your package by adding on a trip to the top of the canyon before you head back on your helicopter. The Amazing SkywalkThe Skywalk is on top of the West Rim, and you don't want to miss it. The Skywalk is a huge platform that's made from glass panels that lets you look down to the canyon floor 4000 feet below you. A walk on the Skywalk is the perfect way to top off an exhilarating helicopter tour of the canyon. Deluxe ToursYou can choose a basic helicopter tour or upgrade to a deluxe one. While both types of tours provide fantastic views and a thrilling flight, the deluxe version has a few extra perks. One difference is the basic tours take off from Boulder City which is just outside of Vegas. If you can swing the extra cost of a deluxe flight, you should consider it. The tours utilize the state-of-the-art EcoStar sightseeing helicopters. The cabins are comfy, quiet, roomy, and they offer the best views available. The panoramic viewing window and roomy cabin are enough to make the extra cost worth it. Deluxe tours also provide you with free transportation by limousine, convenient lift off from the Vegas Strip and an aerial tour of Vegas that is quite beautiful at sunset when the lights come alive. Lock In Your Seats EarlyYou want to book your flight early, in fact, it's a good idea to book your seats when you book your hotel in Las Vegas. Since the chopper tours are so popular, they fill up fast, so try to get your tour purchased about two weeks ahead of time. Also, buy your tickets online so you can cut out the markup added by travel agents. When you buy your tour online with your credit card, you can get instant confirmation of your purchase and qualify for special pricing. Helicopter Tours Are MemorableA helicopter tour of the West Rim is a lot of fun. You have a lot of choices in add-on adventures, so you can create the perfect day on your Vegas side trip. Don't forget to buy your tour early and buy it online. Don't miss out on your chance to witness one of the world's great natural wonders, from a vantage point that only a helicopter can provide.
