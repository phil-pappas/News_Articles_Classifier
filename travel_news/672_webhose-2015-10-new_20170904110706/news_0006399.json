For the first time, the solution will be delivered as a standalone component to an airline that is not using the Amadeus Altéa Suite, Amadeus’ airline Passenger Service System (PSS). The solution will automate Virgin Australia’s aircraft load control and optimise flight departures, integrating with their current PSS.\nVirgin Australia’s General Manager of Network Operations, Andrew Lillyman, said “Virgin Australia is pleased to work with Amadeus to implement their flight management application. Achieving optimal aircraft load distribution is key to safety of flight, improving fuel efficiency, optimising cargo and increasing productivity.”\nAmadeus and Virgin Australia will build an interface to integrate with the airline’s current passenger service system.\nHazem Hussein, Executive Vice President, Airline Commercial, Amadeus Asia Pacific, added, “Working with Virgin Australia to implement Altéa Departure Control Flight Management as a standalone solution to their existing PSS is a huge milestone for us. This opens the doors to any carrier who is looking for a best-in-class weight and balance solution without wanting to go through a full migration to a new passenger service system, allowing them to adopt a best-of-breed strategy to empower their PSS. Amadeus has always believed in personalising our solutions for our customers to help them drive better business outcomes, and this partnership is a strong testament to that approach.”\nAltéa DC-FM improves the productivity of load controllers and enables airlines to centralise load control operations. This means load controllers can safely handle many flights simultaneously through a single, intuitive, graphical interface, without having to switch between different systems. The solution helps airlines analyse passenger and cargo load more precisely, and optimises aircraft load distribution. This enables airlines to more accurately forecast the fuel needed for every flight departure.\nThe Altéa Departure Control Flight Management solution is currently used by more than 90 airlines and ground handlers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:14:33.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
