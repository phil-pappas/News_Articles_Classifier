They did say they couldn’t see a point of impact. \nMaggie was reporting from the staging area at the Unicoi County tourism center off Interstate 26. \nThe emergency director also said it’s hard to find anything because it’s nighttime and because of the weather. \nDEVELOPING STORY : Live reports continue on Fox Tri-Cities News at 10:30 and News 5 Tonight at 11.
