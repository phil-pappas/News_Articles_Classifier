Traveling with a group of your bros is even more difficult, finding the perfect location where everyone gets enough activities, luxury options and Instagram bragging moments. Costa Rica is that perfect place.Located in Central America with unlimited tourist potential, Costa Rica is ranked as one of the most visited and safe international destinations. It is also one of the most tropical and diverse, filled with half a million species, an exuberance of wildlife and lush jungle all surrounded by canals and lagoons. Oh, and did I mention five active volcanoes?I decided to create the ultimate getaway for a group of guys and was convinced the spectacular Four Seasons Costa Rica was the perfect home base for my adventure filled week. This is an easy trip from the U.S. with non-stop flights into Liberia Airport via Delta Airlines. Upon arrival you are met at baggage claim and whisked to the resort in a private SUV with a bottle of chilled champagne waiting.[caption id=\"attachment_2670\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Zip Lining in Costa Rica[/caption]Taking a private, gated drive past immaculate grounds, I arrived at the Resort to an amazing VIP greeting by the staff, where we were handed rum-filled coconuts, and then off to tour the resort. Located along the sandy beaches of Peninsula on an isthmus between the Pacific Ocean and Culebra Bay, the 45 acre resort is pure decadence. All refurbished and upgraded, the 181 guest rooms and suites are built into a tropical hillside along with two beaches and four swimming pools.My focus however, was with the luxurious private residences at the Four Seasons. All offering enough space for a group of friends with tons of privacy, and all the comforts of home. Choose from 20 residences with full Four Seasons service and amenities – including infinity-edge plunge pools and outdoor showers.[caption id=\"attachment_2669\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Casa del Cielo Private residence at the Four Seasons (photo by Matthew Mitchell)[/caption]I was lucky to stay in the magnificent 6,727sf Casa del Cielo Estate with five bedrooms including a staff cottage. With a commanding view of the ocean and one of the largest private infinity pools I have ever seen, I couldn’t wait to jump in. While still feeling you are in a jungle with Howler monkeys lounging in the trees and enormous iguanas basking in the sun, this is true luxury, and with top notch service, is the perfect location for high-end travelers. While not an inexpensive option for sure, this is a place where a group of successful guys can unwind and relax on an ultimate holiday. The average nightly cost for the estate during high season is $25,000 per night.[caption id=\"attachment_2663\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Beachfront at the Four Seasons Costa Rica (photo by Matthew Mitchell)[/caption]My first plan on the itinerary for that afternoon was to unwind and indulge into a three hour spa treatment created for the ultimate luxury. An organic Costa Rican Coffee Scrub, a Green Coffee Detoxifying Wrap ending with a Rainforest Aromatherapy Massage. Followed by the best margaritas in Central America and a great meal I was ready to crash.[caption id=\"attachment_2664\" align=\"\" width=\"1600\"] Aerial view of the Four Seasons Costa Rica[/caption]The next morning we woke early for a day of Deep Sea Fishing aboard the hi-tech and spacious EL JEFE fishing boat. We were picked up on the beach fronting the resort with a top notch crew who were accustomed to taking care of celebrities and successful executives, and knew how to instruct a novice like myself. In search of large elusive fish we ventured further north up the coast, and once our lines were out we began reeling in some amazing creatures. First up was a huge colorful Roosterfish, quickly followed by a five foot Needle Fish, a five foot Barracuda and more. There were so many fish that we decided to catch and release and only save one for fresh Ceviche prepared by the crew. Our gourmet lunch and drinks were custom prepared by the Four Seasons Resort.[caption id=\"attachment_2662\" align=\"\" width=\"1480\"] The crew of the El Jefe for a day of Deep Sea Fishing (photo by Matthew Mitchell)[/caption][caption id=\"attachment_2671\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Proud of my big catch Roosterfish (photo by Matthew Mitchell)[/caption]Back at the resort we were treated to a gourmet meal at the gorgeous Sol y Sombra restaurant with the resorts GM, the charming Pascal Forotti and the resorts beautiful publicist Oriane Lluch (who quickly became our best friend on the vacation). They both engaged us with great conversation along with a delicious wine pairing. The menu featured a land-to-sea concept, showcasing fresh and sustainable items such as chicken and seafood cooked in a traditional South American style on a rotisserie. Chef Dario Montelvere and the amazing pastry chef Guillermo Soto contributed to a perfect evening.One of the benefits of this resort, is you never have to leave for meals. There is such a wide variety of options at the resorts restaurants ranging from local fare to Italian and Mexican and beyond. Also the bar with live music provides an ample lively backdrop to mingle with other guests. Supermodel Gisele Bundchen and Michael Jordan are among the many regulars to the area, so who knows who you will rub elbows with.[caption id=\"attachment_2667\" align=\"\" width=\"1920\"] Restaurant at the Four Seasons Costa Rica[/caption]The Four Seasons Costa Rica caters to thrill seekers as well as those wanting to unwind and relax, but I know most groups of men prefer active adventures, so I made sure to indulge in the best that Costa Rica has to offer. I can’t wait to head back to Costa Rica to the welcoming embrace of the Four Seasons Resort where you quickly become a family member and they eagerly await your return.[caption id=\"attachment_2668\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Amazing greeting from the Four Seasons Hotel staff: (l to r) Marlon Rojas, Gabriel Orias, GM Pascal Forotti, Alonso Rojas, Daniela Zamora, Scarleth Lopez, Luis Gallotti, Maria Elena Meza, Oriane Lluch (photo by Matthew Mitchell) Back: Pascal Forotti, Luis Gallotti, Oriane Lluch[/caption]Here are my picks for the best activities to add to your luxurious vacation. The Four Seasons concierge will help create the perfect itinerary for your group as well as provide transportation. ZIPLINE ADVENTURE WITCH’S ROCK : Located just 20 minutes from Four Seasons includes 24 platforms, 11 cables from 100 to 450 meters in length, 3 suspension bridges and three climbing trees. The views range from dry forest to ocean to waterfalls to sunset. Better for all ages and novices. MONTE VERDE EXTREMO : Located 2 hours from the resort above the cloud forest in central Costa Rica, this zip-ling extravaganza involves 14 platforms at a starting height of nearly 1,400 feet. Four of the rides go on for nearly a half-mile, and at the end, a free Tarzan swing awaits. The property also has a separate Superman zip-line that goes really far, really fast, and a bungee jump option. GOLFING IN THE DARK At the Arnold Palmer–designed Four Seasons Golf Club Costa Rica at Peninsula Papagayo, breathtaking views over the Pacific Ocean or Culebra Bay await at 14 of the 18 holes, along with significant elevation changes and tremendous variety. The signature sixth hole features a dramatic 446-yard par-4 with a tee shot that plays 61 metres (200 feet) downhill to a receptive valley-shaped fairway.Use night vision goggles to play you walk in the dark with your guide as you play holes 1 and 9. Hole 1, Las Huacas, par-5, 543-yards, features a sharp dogleg with the option to shorten the hole by shooting over the bunkers at the dogleg corner or drive down the wide fairway. Hole 9, Pizote, par-5, 522-yards, plays through the lush Nascascolo Forest, with a rock-lined stream that protects the course’s most severely contoured green.Golfers are assisted under the starry night sky with a line of lights along the fairways and a circle of light on the greens. Lanterns are also available to light the way as you walk the course with pull-carts.[caption id=\"attachment_2665\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Nocturnal golfing at the Four Seasons Costa Rica[/caption] SURFING The small town of Tamarindo caters to surfers at all levels, offering easy access to a number of beach and reef breaks, such as Playa Negra, Witch’s Rock and Ollie’s Point. Located on the Pacific Coast, this is a perfect area for exploring a variety of surfing breaks in a short period of time. Consistent swells and offshore winds provide good surf conditions throughout the year.Playa Negra has one of the best surf spots in Costa Rica. It's a right point break with very fast waves best to be surfed during transition of the tides. Only for experts though. For more approachable surfing, I would try Playa Grande which has the most consistent waves in the area. When Tamarindo gets too crowded you can paddle with your board across the river to get to the surf spot \"La Casita\" with its fast beach break.[caption id=\"attachment_2673\" align=\"\" width=\"800\"] Surfers in Costa Rica (photo by Lachlan Bailey)[/caption] ISLAND PARTY AT COCO BEACH I decided to experience the local Costa Rica life by visiting Coco Beach, a short boat ride from the Four Seasons Resort. Our host for the day was the gregarious owner of Ventas Coco Sea Sports as well as the legendary Claudio y Gloria Restaurant on the beach. Javier Rojas was born and raised on the beach and his family has owned the restaurant and property for decades. He is an expert at local fishing trips as well as hosting large groups at his authentic restaurant located right on the Playa Del Coco.Javier picked us up from the beach at the Four Seasons in his yacht and took us to Coco Beach for lunch and a tour of the village, which includes a Hard Rock Hotel as well as a local Casino and tons of shopping opportunities to bring goodies back home. Javier’s wife has a great boutique shop that offers the best selection in the area.We dined with local realtor Elena Rodriguez and Javier and discovered the many luxury changes coming to the area including new high end resorts and villas. Lunch was grilled Mahi Mahi and Lobster tail made to perfection with local Costa Rican beer.Make sure you coordinate a private transfer with Javier and dinner with cocktails and live music at this charming and VERY local destination. Not luxurious for sure, more of a rough and ready party town filled with bars, but totally fun where you can mingle with the international surfers and locals.[caption id=\"attachment_2679\" align=\"\" width=\"644\"] Claudio y Gloria Restaurant on Coco Beach[/caption] VOLCANOES, RAPPELLING AND MORE Adventurous groups like to visit the Canyon at Guachipelin , where you can rappel, rock climb and swing through the jungle before a horseback ride and a chance to swim beneath a cool waterfall. The location includes a steep canyon over a turbulent river, where you will zip line, rappel and rock climb, cross hanging bridges and ride Tarzan swings.[caption id=\"attachment_2692\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] Rappelling waterfalls in Costa Rica[/caption]There are five active volcanoes: Arenal, Irazu, Poas, Rincon De La Vieja, and Turrial. The visit to Arenal Volcano near La Fortuna can be combined with a variety of other activities including hanging bridge tours, waterfall, mountain biking, thermal springs and more.Also there is the Rincon de la Vieja National Park in a starkly beautiful area with widespread thermal activity, located two hours from the Four Seasons. The park’s natural features include geysers, vents and fumaroles, as well as the Santa Maria volcano, which rises to 6,286 feet.[caption id=\"attachment_2672\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"] Howler monkey's in the trees at the Four Seasons Costa Rica (photo by Oriane Lluch)[/caption]VIDEO TOUR OF THE FOUR SEASONS RESORT COSTA RICA:", "external_links": ["http://www.fourseasons.com/costarica/", "http://www.guachipelin.com/en/canyon-canopy-tour.html", "http://www.fourseasons.com/costarica/accommodations/private_residences/casa_del_cielo_residence_estate/", "http://www.fourseasons.com/costarica/services_and_amenities/golf/course/?c=t&_s_icmp=mmenu", "http://www.arenal.net/arenal-volcano-tour.htm", "http://monteverdeextremo.com/", "http://witchsrockcanopy.com/tours/zip-line-tours/", "http://eljefecostarica.com/"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:56:15.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
