We've all got a bucket list of things to do and see, and yes, this even includes well-travelled 'tweens' (pre-teenage years)! \nFor the jet-setting 12-year-old, British Airways presents 12 things to tick off your bucket list from meeting Santa in Finland to chowing down on an authentic croque monsieur in France! \n1. Go BIG or go home Play chopsticks on the giant piano in toy shop FAO Schwarz in New York, made popular in the Tom Hanks film “Big”. Better jump on those keys quick as FAO Schwarz will be closing its doors soon! \n2. Selfie with Mickey Mouse It's every child's dream to go to Disneyland so what better way to commemorate that experience by taking a selfie with Mickey Mouse! There are Disneylands the world over but for the original and the best, it has to be Disneyworld Florida. \n3. Get a pen pal Getting a pen pal may seem like a dated idea in the age of the internet but what better way to learn how to lick a stamp and send a letter! Plus it's a great way to learn about the world without having to leave your desk! \n4. Je voudrais un “croque monsieur” When in France, you don't order a ham and cheese sandwich but a “croque monsieur” instead. Not only do you get to chow down on a fancy sandwich, you get to say that you spoke French! \n5. Game of Bones Stare in awe at the dinosaurs that used to roam the Earth at London's Natural History Museum and bring a little piece of them back with you from the gift shop. \n6. See Santa in his native land Contrary to popular belief, Santa isn't from the North Pole but actually from Finland. Be transported into a fairytale land with the beautiful sights of Santa's very own grotto in Lapland. \n7. Make a splash! For the thrill-seekers, gravity-defying waterslides are always a crowd-pleaser. Check out the Aquaventure Waterpark at the Atlantis Palm, Dubai, for a splashing good time! \n8. Stay classy Spend your day marvelling at pandas, wombats, gorillas, komodo dragons and other amazing creatures at the San Diego Zoo! \nWhen in Rome, eat lots of gelato! – The Malaysian Insider pic, October 16, 2015. 9. Just one Gelato When it comes to gelato, there's no better place to get it than in Italy! Perfect for keeping cool on a hot day out, why stop at just one! \n10. Scream if you want to go faster Theme park rides are a favourite for kids and adults alike. Whether it's Disneyland or Alton Towers, you're never too old for roller coasters! \n11. Head in the sand Burying your parent or siblings in the sand is a must-do when you're at the beach. Leaving only their head out, it's an essential holiday photo everyone should have! \n12. Rule the world at KidZania If you wanted a place where kids are in charge, head on over to KidZania where education meets entertainment and kids rule in mini-cities. \nIntrigued? You should be! If you want to get a headstart on completing your bucket list, British Airways is offering special year-round fares from 10 December 2015 to 30 June 2016.
