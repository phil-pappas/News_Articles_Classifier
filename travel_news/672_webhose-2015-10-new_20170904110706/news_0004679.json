The sector splits professional investors, with some now ready to back banks in the hope that their recovery can continue, while others are sceptical that balance sheets are yet free of all the after effects of the crisis. With the major banks all reporting interim results in the coming days, and with small investors mulling the benefits of the Government’s offer of discounted shares in Lloyds, we take the temperature of the banking sector and provide ordinary investors with a toolkit to make their own assessment. The case for banks Central to the growing optimism about banks is that many of the obstacles facing the sector have now been worked through. Tough requirements on the cash they hold to cover their liabilities that were introduced after the financial crisis initially sapped their ability to pay dividends – and stopped some completely. Now, though, the banks are meeting, and exceeding, these requirements. • Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas Similarly, consumer redress programmes and fines, most notably for payment protection insurance mis-selling, now appear to have peaked. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is expected to impose a time limit on PPI claims that will give consumers until the spring of 2018 to lodge their complaint. It has led some fund managers to make bullish predictions for the dividends that banks, particularly Lloyds, will be able to pay shareholders in the near future. \"We have been waiting for banks to become boring again.\" Alex Wright, manager of Fidelity Special Situations , once home to the legendary investor Anthony Bolton, recently predicted that Lloyds would be able to maintain a strongly growing dividend which, at the time of the prediction, would have meant the shares yielding 7pc in 2017. He holds HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds in his fund. He said this week: “I started increasing our positions in banks about 18 months ago. As their capital has improved to an appropriate level, they can now pay out more of that money to shareholders.” Other fund managers who are optimistic about the prospects for banks include Adrian Frost, co-manager of the Artemis Income fund, and Steve Davis, who manages Jupiter UK Growth . Mr Frost said: “We have been waiting for banks to become boring again. Our sense is that banks now have a clearer perspective on the regulatory regime and this clarity is one of the reasons to be optimistic about banks. \"The regulatory demands have forced management to think more rationally about the areas in which they do business and the returns they make. This is most apparent in investment banking, where hard choices are being made.” The case against banks Bank had been stalwarts for investors looking for a steady income before the crisis and their rapid descent left many nursing burned fingers. The credit crisis highlighted the difficulty in assessing the liabilities lurking on banks' balance sheets while the catalogue of fines and redress – from PPI to Libor rigging – that has plagued the sector has created added uncertainty for investors. Neil Woodford, manager of the hugely popular Woodford Equity Income Fund, sold his only stake in a bank, HSBC, last year. It was the only bank he had held in more than a decade and he explained the sale at the time by citing the “risk of fine inflation in the industry”. How does Lloyds compare Many small investors will be weighing the prospects of one bank in particular: Lloyds. The Government, which took a stake in the enlarged Lloyds Banking Group when Alistair Darling was chancellor, has announced that it will sell £2bn of the shares it owns to retail investors next spring at a 5pc discount to whatever the price is then. Additionally, those buying will be handed a bonus share for every 10 they buy and hold for a year. That means investors stand, in effect, to get their holding at a 15pc discount. As long as the shares do not fall by 15pc between the point of purchase and the time at which they want to sell after the year has expired, the deal will have paid off. Investors also need to be satisfied that the investment case for buying Lloyds stacks up. The Telegraph’s share tipster, Questor, recently expressed concern that Lloyds still faced risks, and urged readers to pass on the deal . Among the concerns was the possibility of a weakening housing market in the face of interest rate rises. This could increase losses from bad loans. How you can assess the banks The major banks will report financial results between October 28 and November 2 and investors will be looking out for a number of key indicators for clues about their future performance (see table). Lloyds Optimism around Lloyds is driven by a view that its dividend will grow. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, the investment shop, said: “Lloyds has just started to pay dividends again and is expected to become a bit of a cash cow in the coming years.” The forecast dividend yield for next year is 4.8pc. Mr Wright said Lloyds was unlikely to provide much capital growth because it was already a market leader in many areas. The dividend would reward investors, he said. Lloyds' share price is being held back by concerns over PPI and the uncertainty surrounding the sale of the Government’s stake. Mr Khalaf said its forecast price-to-earnings (p/e) ratio, a common valuation yardstick that divides price per share by profits, remains slightly below its five-year average. What about the strength of the bank's reserves? One arcane-sounding but important measure is the \"common tier 1 capital ratio\", which measures a bank's capital against the size of its balance sheet, taking into account how risky its loans are. All banks have a target of 9pc by 2019. It is a strong indicator of a bank’s general health and ability to pay returns to shareholders. Lloyds is leading the field on this measure. “Return on equity” gives us an idea of the profitability of a business – the profit derived from shareholders' cash. Again, Lloyds lead the way. This figure takes no account of the stock market valuation. How the banks compare Forecast dividend yield - next 12 months (%) Forward p/e - next 12 months (5-yr ave in brackets) Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio (%) Latest return on Equity (%) HSBC 6.5 9.8 (11.2) 11.6 10.6 Lloyds 4.8 9.7 (10.3) 13.3 16.2 Barclays 3.3 9.4 (7.8) 11.1 7.7 (11.1 for core business) Standard Chartered 3.6 10.5 (10.4) 11.5 5.4 Royal Bank of Scotland 0 13 (12.1) 12.3 9.8 (14pc for continuing businesses) Source: Hargreaves Lansdown Barclays Barclays is forecast to yield just 3.3pc over the next year. It is focusing on restructuring away from investment banking, Mr Khalaf said, and building up capital, which means any dividend growth is on hold for now. The shares are currently priced slightly above their five-year average on a p/e basis. Barclays currently lags peers in terms of tier 1 capital, so investors should look for improvement in the forthcoming results. On profitability, Barclay’s core business, which includes credit cards, retail banking and its African division, stacks up well, but those parts in need of restructuring, such as investment banking, are dragging the overall figure lower. HSBC HSBC’s dividend yield looks tempting now because its share price fell in the recent sell-off thanks to the bank’s exposure to China. It is engaged in a major repositioning towards Asia, an area that markets don’t like at the moment, and that is making the shares cheap compared with their long-term p/e average. The bank has healthy capital cover and profitability is above target, although it lags the core businesses of the other banks. RBS Royal Bank of Scotland still isn’t paying dividends and is not expected to until 2017 at the earliest. Earnings forecasts are low as the bank tries to sell off further assets as part of its recovery, and that has made the shares expensive against their average. Capital strength appears to be adequate but RBS’s profitability looks low while the divisions it hopes to sell remain on the balance sheet. Standard Chartered The bank halved its dividend in the first half of this year. Investors should keep an eye out in the third-quarter results for any hints from management on the future path of dividends. Standard Chartered has large Asian exposure and is struggling with a rise in costs from loans not being repaid. Tier 1 capital lags slightly compared with rivals and Standard Chartered is also behind on profitability. Management has recognised that this isn’t adequate and is aiming to double profitability in future. The Telegraph has launched its own DIY investment service, designed with simple pricing.
