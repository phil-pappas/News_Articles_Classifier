Established in 1988 following the impulse given by 14 business leaders who shared a vision for the European industry, EFQM has supported many organisations on their journey to excellence.\nEFQM, its partners and all associated organisations form a large excellence community with over 50,000 participants. They share the same appetite for learning and continuous improvement to achieve excellence. Whether from the public or private sector, small or large, the members of this community want to drive sustainable excellence, relying largely on the development of their human capital. This culminates with the annual EFQM Excellence Awards, which recognises Role Model organisations in Europe and beyond, whether private, public or not-for-profit. These are excellent organisations with an indisputable track record of success in turning strategy into action and continuously improving their performance.\nThe award is a prestigious recognition only bestowed by an independent jury composed of high profile, highly respected people from the world of business, public service and academia. This is given to an organisation demonstrating they are truly a role-model of excellence. If the jury feels that none of the applicants can clearly demonstrate this level of excellence, no award is given that year. This is what makes the EFQM Award such a prestigious award. This year, the jury decided to recognise BMW Group Werk Regensburg and British housing enterprise WDH as the EFQM Award Winners for 2015.\nMarc Amblard , Chief Executive Officer of EFQM, comments: \"Our operating environment, whether for the private or the public sector, is increasingly complex. Our economies and markets are volatile and the underlying growth limited, which is expected to last. In order to ensure their sustainable performance in such conditions, organisations must be agile, address all stakeholders' expectations in a balanced way by efficiently deploying their strategy, developing their human capital and innovating, regardless of the sector they operate in. For the 24th year, the EFQM Excellence Awards recognises organisations that perform best when it comes to addressing these challenges that is when it comes to achieving excellence. The EFQM Excellence Model provides the framework for assessing their maturity. This year, the Jury decided to grant BMW Group Plant Regensburg and British Housing enterprise WDH the EFQM Excellence Award. Our Excellence Community looks forward to learning from their good practices.\"\nAbout the EFQM Excellence Award\nThe EFQM Excellence Awards are supported by one of the most challenging assessment processes. To assess organisations and identify role model practices, an international team of five to seven experienced, specifically trained managers spend one week on site and an average of 500 hours in total per applicant. They review documents and interview individuals as well as groups to analyse how effective the organisation is against the EFQM Excellence Model. The feedback report prepared by the assessors provides a wealth of value adding input to help the organisation improve at a strategic level. The reports are then presented to an independent jury that decides the level of recognition for each Nominee.\nhttp://www.efqm.org\nPictures are available here: http://bit.ly/1OASYve\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279337LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201510213589&Transmission_Id=201510230300PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201510213589&DateId=20151023", "http://www.efqm.org/", "http://bit.ly/1OASYve"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:04:05.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
