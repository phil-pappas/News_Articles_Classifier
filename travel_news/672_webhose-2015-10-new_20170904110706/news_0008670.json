But what exactly does this mean for the countries and their people? From a business angle, industry experts said this signals a common interest to increase bilateral trade and more employment opportunities, stimulating further recovery in the British economy. The nations already have strong trade links. China is Britain’s fourth-largest trading partner, while Britain is China’s second-largest trading partner in the European Union. Britain’s trading partnership with China is of critical importance to our economic future According to figures from the Chinese Embassy, bilateral trade rose fourfold between 2004 and 2014 from $19.7 billion to $80.9 billion. “Britain’s trading partnership with China is of critical importance to our economic future,” said Simon Moore, international director of the Confederation of British Industry. He added that President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Britain from Oct 19 to 23, the first by a Chinese head of state for a decade, had come at an ideal time to strengthen these bonds. Bilateral investment has also been developing at a healthy pace. China has invested more than $40 billion in Britain, according to the embassy’s data, while UK Trade and Investment, a government support agency, said that during the 2014-15 fi scal year Chinese investment created more than 6,000 jobs. Britain was also the first major country to agree to a currency swap with China, signing a deal last year worth 200 billion yuan (£20.6 billion). Chinese visitors have very positive perceptions of Britain. They stay longer here... In addition, hundreds of joint education programmes, tourism promotions and cultural activities have brought Chinese and Britons closer together on a personal level. More than 150,000 Chinese students were enrolled at British schools and colleges last year, while the number of Chinese tourists was 230,000. The size of both groups has been forecast to rise sharply by 2020. “Chinese visitors have very positive perceptions of Britain. They already stay longer here than in other European destinations and are big spenders,” said Sally Balcombe, chief executive of VisitBritain. “We aim to double the current annual expenditure in Britain by Chinese visitors to £1 billion a year within the next five years,” she added. So how might President Xi’s visit help cement a golden era in Sino-British relations? Lord Wei, a Tory peer and former adviser to the Cabinet, said the trip would “galvanise trade, cultural exchange and dialogue” and take them to new levels. “There are also many opportunities to co-operate on the global stage diplomatically: fighting terrorism, safeguarding waters, maintaining peace in areas of potential conflict and providing assistance to help poorer regions develop infrastructure and tackle poverty,” he said. British media have reported that the Chinese president was expected to sign an agreement while in London that would fi rm up co-operation in the nuclear energy sector. The deal would see Chinese companies build a reactor near a decommissioned plant in Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, which would be the first Chinese-designed and operated nuclear facility in a developed Western nation, according to reports. Golden: Good time for state visit “Britain needs to deliver a fleet of new nuclear stations and it’s vital we attract investors from around the world,” said John Hutton, chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association. “China is a global leader in nuclear power and can bring expertise and capability of great value to Britain.” While some residents and politicians have protested the plans over concerns about the safety of China’s nuclear technology, Prof Fu Xiaolan, director of the University of Oxford’s Technology and Management Centre for Development, said the co-operation was mutually beneficial. In general, she said, “China and Britain can realise a strong union and become good partners.” She said that the countries’ governments were taking a “positive and pragmatic approach” regarding each other’s national interests. Healthy progress has been made diplomatically and commercially over the past few years... “Healthy progress has been made diplomatically and commercially over the past few years between our two countries,” added Lord Wei. “As China seeks to transition dramatically to a more sustainable, advanced and consumer-led economy, Britain has an opportunity to share its know-how and world-class services skills and content in areas as diverse as media, sport, leisure, hospitality, research, finance and education.” Tim Summers, a senior consulting fellow at London think tank Chatham House, said changes in global economic and commercial interactions also provided opportunities for Beijing and London such as those resulting from the Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to improve China's connectivity with Europe, Asia and Africa. Britain should play a prominent role in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which was established this year and could aid this connectivity, he said, adding that British companies were already looking to engage with Chinese counterparts in third markets. Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to Britain, said President Xi’s visit would see the countries’ leaders “map out a long-term development blueprint for bilateral ties, which will further deepen Sino-British co-operation and make our comprehensive strategic partnership stronger and more substantial”. More mature and stable relations would bring tangible benefits to both nations and contribute to world peace and development, he said. • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:40:54.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
