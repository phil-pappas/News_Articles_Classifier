Its slabs of meat are cut as thick as the September issue of Vogue . Bucking the usual deli orthodoxy of mustard-only austerity, it seems to have a forest floor on top: fernlike fronds of dill, pellets of cracked rye berries and squiggles of cucumbers that have been pickled in buttermilk.\nNo less a gastronome than Alice Waters, an influential chef from Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., paid tribute to it on Instagram after a Harry & Ida’s drop-in. “Inspiring to me!” she wrote.\nBut take some time to browse the shelves while that sandwich is put together, and it becomes clear that you are in a pretty weird place, as delis go. What, for example, is that big mutant-looking bulb with an ashy blackness on the outside and an orange core whose hue calls to mind artisanal Cheetos?\n“This is chaga,” Will Horowitz said the other day, giving a tour of the shop that he owns and runs with his sister, Julie, and other partners. “This is grown on yellow birch.” Horowitz, 32, suggested putting some of the tree fungus in a pot with water to brew a healthful elixir.\n“With a little mint and honey, it’s actually become my favorite iced tea in the world,” he said.\nA mélange\nof folk styles\nChaga is a small example of the Horowitz approach to food, which might be described as a neohippie mélange of folk styles that he has gradually picked up from studying centuries of Jewish, Southern, Asian and American Indian traditions.\nA stroll through the backrooms of Harry & Ida’s may involve sniffing a freshly cut slab of sassafras root, nibbling on skate jerky, slurping down a spoonful of cockles that have been steeping in smoked thyme oil, and surveying buckets of crab apples that are soaking and spruce tips that are curing in root-cellar darkness.\nCan you eat cattails? Apparently so; Harry & Ida’s is selling a pickled version of them. “They grow all over the place, man,” Horowitz said.\nSauces froth. Smoke is piped through a refrigerator. Beef tongues bob in brine. “All sorts of wild stuff is going on in here at any given time,” Horowitz said. “When you study these heritage foods, that is the real flavor.”\nTo extract and amplify that flavor, he and his sister have assembled a young crew, with about a half-dozen people at its core, that comes across as less of a traditional kitchen brigade than a 1970s-style theater troupe.\nFearless\nexplorers of funk\nCompared with other New York chefs who get plenty of attention for their experimental and explosive approach, the Horowitz cooks are relatively unsung, but in the last few years they have evolved into fearless explorers of funk, converting their fixation on smoking, foraging and fermenting into a quest to make contact with the outer reaches of the palate.\nThe path has been unconventional from the beginning. Julie Horowitz, a Vassar College graduate who is now 28, was teaching English on Réunion, the French island in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar, when she heard that her brother, who has an admitted fondness for playing table tennis without any clothes on, was being asked to come up with a snack-heavy menu for SPiN New York, a Flatiron district table-tennis hangout. He wanted his sister to help him manage the kitchen operations.\n“Which was crazy,” Julie Horowitz said. “Because we had no experience opening anything at that point.”\nAfter a spell at SPiN, the brother-and-sister duo, who grew up in Westchester County, decided in 2012 to open their own restaurant in the East Village, Ducks Eatery, and, this year, Harry & Ida’s, named after their great-grandparents, who ran a deli in Harlem.\nFrom the outside, neither place looks like an outpost of cutting-edge cuisine. Jorge Riera, wine director at Contra and Wildair on the Lower East Side, ambled into Harry & Ida’s this summer, peeked behind the front counter and was surprised to see a tank swarming with live eels, delivered fresh by a supplier in Connecticut.\n“We have an eel guy,” Will Horowitz said. “I’ve never seen him wear shoes.” Horowitz and his crew kill the eels and smoke them for a sandwich served on the premises.\nSlaughtering eels is not something that East Village cooks tend to have much experience with. “It’s been a learning process,” Horowitz said.\nOut in the wild, Horowitz’s trips into distant horizons of foraging and fermentation can be extreme enough to cause his family concern.\nAs his sister said, “Almost once a year I get a call from our dad saying, ‘Will is on the verge of life and death because he ate something that he really shouldn’t have.’”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:09:29.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
