PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sat, Oct 17, 2015 GETTY There are 1,500 square miles of breathtaking scenery just waiting to be explored \nMention Yosemite National Park and the first image most people tend to conjure is the sheer granite cliff face of El Capitan, with dozens of microscopic climbers dangling from ropes as they inch their way to the summit. \nThe good news is you don’t have to have aspirations to rival Spider-Man – or even a head for heights – to make the most of a visit to the park. As the 3.7 million people who visit every year have discovered, there are 1,500 square miles of breathtaking scenery just waiting to be explored. \nThis month, Yosemite commemorates 125 years since it was declared a National Park. \nThe legislation preserved a diverse expanse of land that includes a giant sequoia-filled valley (some of the trees are over 2,000 years old), the rapids of the Merced River and the high-altitude magnificence of Tuolumne Meadows, with its expansive, glassy lakes and grassy plains up in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. \nMy husband, Alex, and I had decided to self-cater for three nights and stayed at The Z’s Retreat, a wooden-slatted house in Mariposa, a gold rush mining town on the edge of the National Park. \nHaving eaten breakfast in the sunshine on our porch before driving the 30 minutes into Yosemite, it came as something of a shock to arrive at the park’s entrance to see the weather close in and the downpours begin. \nThis, it turned out, was to be just phase one in a crash course in microclimates. \nThankfully, we quickly discovered the benefit of being in Yosemite when it’s raining: the waterfalls are at their most spectacular. \nTake a walk to the bottom of Yosemite Falls, fight your way through the gawping throng and you’ll find an impressive cascade that measures a breathtaking 2,425 feet from peak to pool – one of the tallest in the world. GETTY Bridalveil Fall \nA short drive away is Bridalveil Fall. As it surges down 600 feet of cliff face, the water is whipped away by the wind before it can hit the rocks below, providing some fabulous photo opportunities. \nHeading up to a scenic overlook, only to discover the park’s most famous granite cliffs – El Capitan and Half Dome – were shrouded in cloud, Alex and I decided to drive through the mile-long Wawona Tunnel to see what awaited us on the other side. We hadn’t anticipated emerging in Narnia. Fir boughs bent under the weight of snow, the air was thick with white flakes and the road slushy. \nFog blotted out views of the valley below but did nothing to disguise the sheer drop at the side of the road. The high sierra had received 20 inches of snow, rendering much of the park inaccessible so we took the first safe opportunity to do a three-point turn and headed back to the valley floor. \nWhile we didn’t come face-to-face with any of the black bears that make the park their home, we saw a coyote brazenly walking alongside the road in broad daylight and were thrilled to spot a bald eagle, America’s national bird, soaring majestically above the Merced River on the hunt for lunch. \nThe wilderness of Yosemite may only be a three-hour drive east from San Francisco but rather than head straight there we had come via one of the most famous roads in the USA – Highway 1, home to the rugged coastline of Big Sur. \nWe stopped at Old Fisherman’s Wharf in Monterey Bay to tuck into steaming clam chowder served in sourdough bread bowls while watching the trawlers at work. Then we strolled along the pier to try the love-it-or-hate-it speciality candy, salt water taffy. \nHofsas House, a Bavarian-style four-storey guesthouse, which has brilliant ocean views, was the perfect place to stay overnight. It’s in the heart of Carmel-by-the-Sea, a sleepy, white-picket-fenced town where Clint Eastwood was once mayor. \nThe biggest mistake many people make when driving along Big Sur is to think the coastline, albeit some of the most spectacular in the world, is the only draw. But leave the tarmac behind and explore on foot and you’ll find deserted coves, jaw-dropping redwood forests and fantastic cafés and restaurants. \nWe made our way to Treebones, a collection of yurts set back from the cliffs high above the Pacific waves. The owners pride themselves in being eco-friendly and “off-grid”, while its elevated position makes it the ideal spot for whale watching. \nIt was also perfectly placed to head to Nepenthe Restaurant. With views that stretch from the Santa Lucia Mountains to the ocean, I couldn’t have imagined a more idyllic place to enjoy a goldfish bowl-sized glass of Californian red as the sun went down.
