Related Content 10 best romantic getaways \nMunoz took over the top job at United on Sept. 8, after the previous CEO Jeff Smisek was forced to resign due to a scandal involving the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. \nThe Port Authority operates New York City airports, and the company has said it is cooperating with a federal investigation. \nInvestigators are looking into whether United Airlines agreed to schedule nonstop flights between its hub in Newark, New Jersey, and Columbia, South Carolina, to curry favor with David Samson, who was then chairman of the Port Authority, who reportedly had a vacation home in South Carolina near that airport. \nJamie Fox, then a United lobbyist who subsequently became New Jersey's Transportation Commissioner in 2014, recently resigned that post as well. \nUnited discontinued the flight three days after Samson resigned the post in the wake of another scandal at Port Authority, so-called Bridgegate. Former members of the administration of NJ Gov. Chris Christie face criminal charges related to allegedly causing traffic jams on and around the George Washington Bridge as a form of political retaliation. \nMunoz, one of only nine Hispanic CEOs of a Fortune 500 company, had previously served as president and chief operating officer of CSX, the freight railroad. He has also served on the board of United Continental since 2010. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource . All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
