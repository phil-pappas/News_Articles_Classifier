These differences may well be explained by limitations in the official system, rather than through illegality.\"\nMolden said that RDE tests can be especially helpful in designing effective test cycles that eliminate discrepancies between lab testing and results from on-road testing.\n\"Our tests provide valuable insights into the relative impact different powertrains and engine sizes have on fuel economy and emissions, in addition to factors such as traffic congestion and speed,\" he noted.\nMolden also discussed results from Emissions Analytics' NOx testing in Europe , explaining that \"real-world testing shows that technical advances aimed at cleaning up diesel emissions also enhance the CO 2 and fuel economy benefits offered by these powerplants.\"\nHe concluded that the call for real-world emissions data, which is growing in part because of the VW scandal, actually could spark further meaningful reductions in vehicle emissions.\nAbout Emissions Analytics\nAs experts in vehicle emissions and fuel consumption, Emissions Analytics supports a range of commercial and publicly-funded organizations. It is currently in partnership with Imperial College, London , studying urban emissions for transport planning and policy. The company also has teamed up with Motor Trend to provide real-world mileage test information on 300 vehicles for the magazine's North American readers. The company also has played a pioneering role as a partner to What Car? magazine's breakthrough \"True MPG\" (miles per gallon) initiative that has seen it test more than 700 passenger-car models and makes providing consumers with an easy and reliable way to assess real-world fuel economy.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150309/180376LOGO\n releases/real-world-emissions-tests-paint-a-more-accurate-picture-for-consumers-300162872.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/real-world-emissions-tests-paint-a-more-accurate-picture-for-consumers-300162872.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150309/180376LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DE33169&Transmission_Id=201510201022PR_NEWS_USPR_____DE33169&DateId=20151020", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150309/180376LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:26:49.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
