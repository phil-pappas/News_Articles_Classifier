Seats per aircraft increased 2.0% to 208.9 while passengers per aircraft rose 1.2% to 167.9 \n- Within emerging markets, passenger volumes were particularly strong to Mexico which was up 16.5%, China up 11.9% and to the Middle East which was up 7.2% as carriers continue to benefit from new A380s \n- Cargo volumes at Heathrow, the UK’s biggest port by value, grew 1.4% over the past 12 months, with increases to notable emerging markets including 36% to Mexico, 25% to Turkey, 13% to Brazil and 5% to India \n- Heathrow expansion would supercharge the Government’s plans for the Northern Powerhouse, new independent analysis of Airports Commission data has revealed. With 95,000 new jobs in the manufacturing sector – 85% of which would be created outside of London and the South East – Heathrow expansion will be a driving force in rebalancing the UK’s economy by creating more export links to fast-growing markets \n- A new graphic using independent data from air quality monitors run by the Government and local councils shows how road vehicles, not emissions from airport operations, are the biggest contributor to air pollution in London. New analysis by DEFRA has confirmed that the M4 near Heathrow will meet EU air quality standards by 2020 as a result of actions taken by us and others \nHeathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said: “With Heathrow expansion, we have a once in a generation opportunity to create 180,000 jobs and provide future generations with the sustainable infrastructure they’ll need to keep Britain at the heart of the global economy. The Chancellor called for Britain to build the new roads, railways and runways it needs to prosper. Heathrow is ready to build – let’s make it happen.” \nRead about additional information at: http://mediacentre.heathrow.com/pressrelease/details/81/Corporate%20&%20...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:49:50.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
