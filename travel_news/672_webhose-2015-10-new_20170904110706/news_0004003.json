Fathom, which provides a different kind of cruise that combines travelers' love of travel with their desire to make a difference, will tap Zarmati's extensive knowledge of the cruise industry to augment its already robust tools designed to support travel professionals in marketing this one-of-a-kind travel experience.\n\"Maurice has been a trusted advisor to Carnival Corporation and me for more than four decades, beginning in 1972 when my father invited Maurice to be among the small group of founding members of the Carnival Cruise Lines team,\" said Micky Arison , chairman of Carnival Corporation. \"I look forward to Maurice's wealth of industry expertise furthering the success of this new category of cruise being pioneered by Fathom.\"\nAn award-winning, multilingual, seasoned expert who is part of the Cruise Lines International Association Hall of Fame, Zarmati's impressive career spans 40-plus years and includes executive-level positions with Carnival Cruise Lines and Costa Cruises.

It is gratifying to be on the ground floor of building something that will for the first time provide travelers the opportunity to build community with like-minded travelers, become immersed in another culture, and work alongside its people to create enduring social impact,\" said Zarmati.\n\"At our first meeting, I knew Maurice could be an incredible resource for Fathom,\" said Tara Russell , president of Fathom and global impact lead for Carnival Corporation. \"Maurice is well-known and highly respected throughout the cruise industry. His first-hand knowledge and multicultural expertise will complement our current programs supporting travel professionals who are selling Fathom to the passionate and growing number of travelers seeking mindful, purpose-driven experiences.\"\nZarmati resides in Miami .
