Six Performance Truck locations are now protected by the market leading electric security fence company.\nPerformance Truck contacted the #1 Theft Deterrent Service â„¢ when they were robbed multiple times last year. General Manager Dayne Yeager explained, \"We would get hit, and every time they hit us the losses were $25,000 to $30,000 . Nothing seemed to work. We had guards, but we have 5-6 acres at each location, so that's a lot of ground to cover.\"\nYeager first discovered Electric Guard Dog at the American Truck Dealers (ATD) Convention. \"I heard great things at ATD, so I got in touch. We signed and installed our first four locations in April and we haven't had any theft there since. So now we've added two more.\"\nElectric Guard Dog CEO Jack DeMao commented \"We are very proud to be a security partner for a market leader like Performance Truck; they're great people, and a great company. We look forward to deterring theft and ensuring their safety for years to come.\"\nDeMao continued, \"We're seeing an explosion in thefts at truck sales, service and leasing companies. We saw 60% revenue growth in this market in 2014, and that trend is continuing in 2015. The ever-increasing complexity of the vehicles means the components have a higher street value, so they're a bigger target for theft. \"\nElectric Guard Dog , ( www.electricguarddog.com ) the #1 Theft Deterrent Service, is the market leader in electric security fences and perimeter security in the country.
