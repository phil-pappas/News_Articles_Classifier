For 11 years now, the farmers of Val d’Andorre have come together to host this event, which is a bond between culture and agriculture. \nHeld on Sunday, the Kiltir dan Lagrikiltir event was the ideal place for those wanting to buy local delicacies, root crops, staple foods, farm animals, and traditional alcoholic beverages as well as juices. \nPeople had gathered around stalls selling a variety of local delicacies such as moutay, a fried sweet brownish-colored cake; desserts made of banana, cassava, yams, and breadfruits; and fresh juices. \nThe Val d’Andorre farmers took part in a competition organized whereby they had to display their fresh produce from their farms, and winners were awarded with their prizes during the Kiltir dan Lagrikiltir event. \nLaunching this event, Minister for Tourism and Culture Alain St.Ange said agriculture is also part of the country’s culture, and it is encouraging to see farmers of Val d’Andorre putting much effort in promoting this important part of Seychelles’ culture. \nHe reaffirmed the Ministry of Tourism and Culture’s support towards such initiative, which he described as a great event on the Festival Kreol program. \nMinister St.Ange urged the Val d’Andorre community to keep up the good work they are doing to promote agriculture and their contribution to the country’s economy. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
