The juicy abundant crop is ready for picking in July and August when the trees are loaded with Montmorency cherries, the most popular tart cherry in America. It's a fun family experience to walk through the cherry orchards and fill a bucket with juicy cherries.\nHowever, cherry shakers mechanically harvest most of the cherries on the more than 2,000 acres of tart cherry orchards in the county.\n\nPhoto by Chris Jones Door County has approximately 2000 acres of Montmorency orchards. The Montmorency cherry takes its name from the Montmorency Valley in France. \nOld timers who once picked all the cherries by hand must marvel at the efficient process. It takes the harvester around seven seconds too gently shake each tree, releasing about 7,000 cherries. The tractor-like shaker with a catcher resembling an upturned umbrella can shake anywhere from 60 to 100 trees per hour.\nFruit trees flourish in the rich alkaline soil of Door Peninsula, a 100-kilometre long finger of land surrounded by Lake Michigan to the east and the protected waters of Green Bay on the west.\nOld fashioned Hollyhocks and other plants and flowers seem to grow bigger and brighter in the fertile area.\nLife is sweet at Terry Ullman's candy store in Sturgeon Bay, where visitors come to enjoy the funky paintings and cherry fudge or bacon-flavored treats.\nThe shops, restaurants and galleries in the Bayside towns such as Egg Harbor, Sturgeon Bay, Fish Creek and Ephraim attract visitors year round, but especially in the summer, where Door County is an outdoor sports hub.\nEach of the four seasons delivers the best nature has to offer. Cherry blossoms in the spring, bright foliage in the fall and ice fishing in the winter.\nSqueaky Cheese\nWisconsin often brings up images of cheese and cheese heads, the fanatic fans of the Green Bay Packers football team. Fresh delicious cheese is abundant in Door County. Visit Renard's Cheese in Sturgeon Bay and stock up on the famous squeaky cheese curds. Yes, they do squeak. The family business employs a master cheese maker, one of six in the United States who have earned the designation.\nContinued on next page\nBut cherries reign supreme on the beautiful peninsula. Breakfast in Fish Creek's classy White Gull Inn is a delicious way to start the day with an order of cherry juice and Cherry Stuffed French Toast, winner of the Best Breakfast in America Challenge on Good Morning America.\nThe family owned Seaquist Orchards in Sister Bay is the county's largest single cherry producer. Cherry salsa, syrup, dried fruits and cherry pie filling are among the many items featuring cherries in the orchard's market.\nIt's okay to spit a cherry pit at Orchard Country Winery & Market where a cherry pit spit is measured out in a special area. It's a sort of local sport in Door County.\nFresh baked cherry pies hot from the oven are sold at the bakery. Take home a fresh-pressed jug of tart cherry juice or a bottle of cherry blossom wine. The atmosphere and pace in Door County whisper \"relax,\" slow down and enjoy.\nPeninsula Paradise\nFirst impressions on the drive to Egg Harbor along Scenic State Highway 42, are clean fresh air, green fields, trees and an overall tidy picture of a pretty state.\nThe peninsula is often described as the Cape Cod of the Midwest, due to 480 kms of shoreline, 11 historic lighthouses, fishing villages and more state parks than any other county in the United States.\nGoats are the focus of Al Johnson's Swedish Restaurant in Sister Bay. Tourists aim their cameras at the restaurant's sod roof where goats, oblivious to their celebrity status, nibble away on the green grass or curl up and sleep until they go home to their barn at night.\nEnd the day with a classic fish boil at Rowley's Bay Restaurant, a vintage waterfront resort. The menu features fresh Lake Michigan whitefish caught by local fishermen. It's cooked outside over an open fire, just as Scandinavian settlers fed lumberjacks and fishermen a century ago.\nAn entertaining storyteller and a huge boiling cauldron add drama to the evening. The beautiful bay and delicious buffet create an enjoyable experience. Sleep tight under the starry skies or in a cozy cottage and start another day in the beautiful Badger State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:10:06.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
