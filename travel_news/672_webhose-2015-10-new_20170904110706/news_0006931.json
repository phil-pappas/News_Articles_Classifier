KLM: Dutch airline KLM will launch a new in-flight safety video on Nov. 1, 2015. The unique video features more than 1,000 tiles of Dutch Delftware, iconic art from the Delft region of the Netherlands, hand-painted to show in-flight safety procedures and animated using stop motion techniques. (Courtesy KLM) \nDelta: Delta Airlines' latest in-flight safety video features some of the most famous Internet memes, including cats and the Double Rainbow guy among others. (YouTube) \nDelta Airlines: The American airline posted this 80s-themed safety video to YouTube in January 2014. Alf, scrunchies and some old school tech all make appearances in the video. Is it all enough to make you pay attention, though? (YouTube) \nAir New Zealand: Air New Zealand used sex appeal to sell their latest in-flight safety video. The airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated swimsuit models to film this \"Safety in Paradise\" video, filmed in the Cook Islands. The video wasn't without controversy, though, with thousands signing a petition saying it sexualized the female body and should be removed from airplanes. (YouTube) \nVirgin America: Back in October 2013, Virgin America employed movie director Jon M. Chu (\"Step Up 2: The Streets,\" \"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never\") and American Idol alum Todrick Hall for a 'Glee'-style in-flight safety video. (YouTube) \nAir New Zealand: Actress Betty White starred in this cheeky in-flight safety video, again filmed for Air New Zealand. Called \"Safety Old School Style,\" White used some of the same humour she employs for her 'Off Their Rockers' TV show in this safety video. (YouTube) \nAir New Zealand: In yet another Air New Zealand safety video, characters from \"The Hobbit\" get a lesson on in-flight safety. Called \"An Unexpected Briefing,\" even Peter Jackson makes a cameo appearance. (YouTube) \nVirgin Atlantic: Virgin Atlantic's latest in-flight safety video is an animated homage to classic films. A dream-sequence takes passengers to the world of James Bond and A Space Odyssey while reminding them about in-flight safety. (YouTube) \nAir New Zealand: The airline's Bare Essentials of Safety video features nude flight attendants (sensitive body parts are hidden by nothing but body paint and cleverly placed life jackets) going through safety procedures ranging from evacuations to electronics use. (YouTube) \nThomson Airways: Kids say the darndest things! The United Kingdomâ€™s Thomson Airways ran with that idea in this cute 2009 airline safety video featuring children as flight attendants. (YouTube) \nVirgin Australia Airlines: Virgin Australia Airlines mixes humour with silly cartoon characters to create an airline safety video that is super entertaining. Look out for a very animated Richard Branson in the clip! (YouTube) \nAir France: The French airline launched this quirky in-flight safety video in spring 2015, featuring five 'passengers' doing the safety demonstrations in clothing the colour of Air France's uniforms. (Courtesy Air France) \nAir New Zealand: Air New Zealand's newest in-flight safety video features world famous surfing stars Gabriel Medina, Mick Fanning and Masatoshi Ohno, and was filmed in Malibu, Australia's Gold Coast and New Zealand.
