The proceeds will benefit Re:new and the Alto Mayo Forest Carbon Project in Northern Peru. \n“United is committed to operating sustainably and responsibly, and that means finding creative ways to further reduce our impact on the environment,” said the airline’s Managing Director of Environmental Affairs and Sustainability Angela Foster-Rice. “As part of our Eco-Skies commitment, we are excited to give these banners a second life, and know our customers will enjoy taking home a piece of the friendly skies.” \nThe Challenge \nUnited challenged the students at Columbia College to create a carry-on bag from the banner material that could: \n1. Fit under an airplane seat (9”x10”x17”) \n2. Be economical to make, yet attractive \n3. Be durable and wearable \nAfter United selected the winning designs, Re:new stepped in to produce the one-of-a-kind, hand-sewn bags featuring distinct skyline images from the airline’s hub cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:37:53.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
