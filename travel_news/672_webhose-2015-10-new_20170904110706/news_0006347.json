Hang on to your shoes in Interlaken, Switzerland 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nWhy I went: I love Switzerland. Many trips there. \nWhere I went: Interlaken, Switzerland. Para-gliding from the north side of the valley down to the city park in front of the Victoria-Jungfrau Hotel . \nDon’t miss: The Tagesteller , translated as the daily plate. Good food at a reasonable price. \nDon’t bother: With fondue, which I refer to as “cheese soup.” It originated with the poor who would save their cheese rinds and old bread and mix it together when they had nothing else to eat. Overpriced and overrated. \nCoolest souvenir: My photographs of this 76-year-old grandfather 2,000 feet above Interlaken. I asked my pilot if any clients ever lost a shoe. “Oh, yes, more than once.” \nWorth a splurge: Tandem kite flying 2,000 feet over Interlaken. Why? I’m 76 and I can. The whole experience cost about $200 U.S. \nWish I’d packed: I’m a veteran traveler. I pack only what I can easily carry in a backpack and a small roller suitcase. \nOther comments: Life does not confine you to a rocking chair when you turn 70 years-plus.
