Along with airport perks like Fast Track immigration privileges and (in Dubai) direct boarding from the A380 lounge, you’ll find onboard comforts like Private Suites with sliding doors and personal mini-bars, gourmet meals served whenever you want (and on Royal Doulton bone china), and Shower Spa bathrooms stocked with Bulgari amenities. A380 passengers can also trade travel stories over a drink around the bartender-manned Onboard Lounge. \nCathay Pacific First Class \nCathay Pacific maintains a steady line of communication with its frequent fliers, and not only takes their comments to heart, but often invites them to test out prototypes of new cabin designs and onboard amenities. So it’s no surprise that its First Class product—launched in 2007 and recently refreshed—ranks high in flier satisfaction. Envisioned by London-based architects Foster + Partners (who also created the flagship First Class Lounge of The Wing in Hong Kong) and accented by custom-created artwork, the sophisticated First cocoons feature high-end materials like stitched leather, smooth silks, and 500-thread-count cotton duvets, pillows, and mattresses. Smart touches abound, from more adjustable meal tables, improved touch-screen controllers, and larger personal closets to organic cotton PYE pajamas and Aesop amenity kits that snap together to create a stackable case. Two flight attendants are dedicated exclusively to the six-seat cabin, and are on hand to serve the plated meals (no trays) and upgraded treats like full tins of caviar. \nBritish Airways First Class \nThe Boeing 787-900 Dreamliners aren’t British Airways’ only new arrivals this year: with the new planes comes a next generation First Class, which expands upon the updated A380 cabin that was launched in 2013. Though many of the details of the evolved cabins are still hush-hush, they will feature the current cubicle-style seats, with personal closets, companion seats, mattress-and-duvet-topped flat-beds, and electronically-controlled window shades, as well as 30 percent more personal space and 60 percent more personal stowage than previous cabins. An elegant décor, mood lighting, and state-of-the-art technology help set the scene, while bespoke amenity kits, soft cotton PJs, and meals served when you want keep things cushy.
