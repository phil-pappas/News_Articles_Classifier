With the re-opening of their fine dining restaurant, now overseen by the renowned chef, restaurateur and television personality Gordon Ramsay, ‘Le Pressoir d’Argent Gordon Ramsay’ offers a gastronomic experience which combines local products with a variety of Bordeaux’s finest grand crus. \n‘Le Pressoir d’Argent Gordon Ramsay’ is situated on the first floor of the hotel and owes its name to the Lobster Press, made by luxury French silvermaker Christofle and which is one of only five in the world. Preserving its original style, the restaurant’s bright mauve and orange colours mark personality whilst offering a subtle and intimate atmosphere. Having re-opened its doors on 25 September 2015, ‘Le Pressoir d’Argent Gordon Ramsay’ is Ramsay’s second restaurant in France and his first venture in Bordeaux. Inspired by the Aquitaine region, Ramsay has crafted a menu featuring the highest quality local produce including dishes such as sautéed foie gras with black figs, native lobster from the ‘press’ steamed with lemon leaf, corn, courgettes, coral and lemon grass bisque, and guanaja chocolate mousse with jivara whipped ganache and toasted sesame ice cream. The restaurant also offers a six course tasting menu for those who want to experience the whole Gordon Ramsay concept on a smaller scale. With a wealth of fine dining experience and creative flare, Head Chef Gilad Peled will be leading the kitchens, having previously worked in London’s Gordon Ramsay Royal Hospital Road. Since his arrival in Bordeaux, Peled has developed close connections with local suppliers to source the finest produce and ingredients. Following the hotel’s unparalleled relationships with a wide range of appellations, such as Margaux, St-Julien, Pauillac, St-Emilion and Sauternes, all dishes will be served with a selection of 550 wines. Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux & Spa also offers a Wine Concierge Service that can create bespoke, luxury programmes for guests to access the great wine estates of Bordeaux. These food and wine initiatives demonstrate the hotel’s ongoing commitment to continually providing its guests with unparalleled experiences, based on the highest level of expertise in the world of gastronomy. On opening the restaurant, Ramsay commented “I’m thrilled to open a restaurant in the wine capital of France with its world-class vineyards and glorious regional produce. Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux & Spa has an incredible history dating back to 18th century and we are really looking forward to working with the hotel team at this incredible listed property in the heart of the City’s golden triangle.\" ‘Le Pressoir d’Argent Gordon Ramsay’ is open in the evenings only (except Sundays and Mondays). The six course tasting menu is 165€ and does not include wine.
