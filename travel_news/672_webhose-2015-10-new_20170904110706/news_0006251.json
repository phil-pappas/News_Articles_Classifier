Well then, get yourself to the Out Islands of the Bahamas where life is one breathtaking beach after another! And the good news is that hurricane Joaquin didn’t do any sustaining damage, so the resorts are as tempting as ever. \nIf you haven’t discovered the Out Islands of the Bahamas yet, you’re missing some of the most beautiful beaches and pristine landscapes on the planet . Why would you fly half way across the world to find intimate resorts and unspoiled natural beauty when they are waiting just 50 miles off America’s Atlantic coast. With new non-stop flights from Altanta, (by Delta Airlines) most travelers east of the Mississippi can be on a beach in the Bahamas with a Bahama-Mama cocktail in their hand by lunchtime. \nAirlift to the Bahamas has always been good to Nassau, Paradise Island, and Grand Bahama Island, but now Delta is making travel to the Out Islands a breeze with nonstop service from Atlanta . The new routes which begin on December 19, 2015 will fly from Atlanta to Georgetown, Exuma daily; Eleuthera and Marsh Harbor in The Abacos twice a week, making it ideal for planning 3 or 4 night getaways. Since the islands of the Bahamas benefit from warm trade winds, temperatures average 70 degrees right through the winter months. \nSo other than warm weather and beautiful beaches, what else can you expect in the Bahamas? Here’s a look at some of the highlights waiting just offshore: \nThe Abaco Islands – A group of 6 major islands and (dozens of small ones) that attract yachting vacationers and casual boaters alike. Boating vacationers can enjoy visiting several of the islands in one getaway, as most are within sight of each other. Or visit neighboring islands by ferry transport leaving from Marsh Harbor and Treasure Cay. Elbow Cay with it’s candy-cane striped lighthouse is a real charmer. The quaint villages on Elbow Cay and Green Turtle Cay will charm you with their “Cape Cod” cottages and white picket fences that were constructed by Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution from New England. And don’t miss Guana Cay with Nippers, one of the best beach bars in the Caribbean! Read all about it in our trip report . \nExuma Islands \nPerhaps the only place in the world you can swim with pigs!! Trust me, it’s hysterical, they come running out from their own private island and jump into the water, oinking all the way. Add that to your bucket list! Aside from the pigs though, the fabulously beautiful Exuma Islands are home to some of the most famous movie stars in the world. Yes, Johnny Depp is there, as well as David Copperfield, Harrison Ford, Nicholas Cage, and so many more. In one day you can swim with pigs, visit Thunderball grotto made famous in James Bond movies, feed giant stingrays, and swim with nurse sharks – wow! Yes, we have a trip report about the delights of Exuma! \nEleuthera \nGoverns Harbour and Harbor Island (one time capital of the Bahamas) have been a magnet for wealthy travelers for many years. The miles and miles of pink sand beaches should not be missed. And then there’s Glass Window Bridge, (which should be one of the natural wonders of the world) where you can stand with waves from the Atlantic ocean crashing one one side and the Caribbean Sea on the other. \nCat Island OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA \nLeave the fast-paced world behind and relax on this pirate’s paradise, named after famed pirate Jack Catt. Spend a few days at the Fernandez Bay Resort where your every need is met in a lovely boutique property along a quiet half-moon bay.
