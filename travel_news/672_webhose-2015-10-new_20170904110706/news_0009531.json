But it turned out otherwise,’” he added. \nThe Golden Week has in the past seen thousands of Chinese tourists landing here over the period. \nIn June, Tourism and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Aziz had announced the Cabinet had agreed to implement the visa-free facility that would allow Chinese tour groups to stay in Malaysia for 15 days from Sept 1. \nBut this was postponed to Oct 1 to ensure guidelines were in place. \nEarlier yesterday, 37 Malaysia Inbound Tourism Association members told reporters they had incurred losses running into millions of ringgit because of the cancellation of bookings by Chinese tour groups. \nAssociation secretary-general Mint Leong said travel agents in China had also decided to call off group tours because of problems related to the visa-free facility. \nShe said nearly 250 groups of 20 each was to have arrived here but most cancelled because of the hiccup. \nShe suggested the Home Ministry resolve the matter immediately so Chinese tourists continue to visit Malaysia. \n“Our currency is not at its best, and we should be encouraging more Chinese tourists to spend their money in Malaysia as they are known to be the big spenders,” she said. \nLeong also suggested the Home Ministry bring back the visa-on-arrival facility for Chinese tourists, which was halted last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:29:17.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
