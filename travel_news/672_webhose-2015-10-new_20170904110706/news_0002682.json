Khan previously backed Heathrow but later switched to Gatwick citing air quality concerns.\nBCC director general John Longworth said: \"Businesses across the UK will be alarmed that both Labour and Conservative party candidates for London Mayor oppose the expansion of Heathrow Airport.\n\"Although the candidates' opposition is unsurprising, it is depressing, as the need for expansion at Heathrow and other key airports grows more pressing and more obvious by the day.\n\"Ministers must not join the mayoral candidates in burying their heads in the sand on this critical issue. We need a green light for a new runway, and we need it fast. The national interest - growth and prosperity - must be put ahead of petty politicking.\"\nIn July, The Airports Commission recommended the government expand Heathrow with prime minister David Cameron promising a decision by the end of the year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:13:52.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
