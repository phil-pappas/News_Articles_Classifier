Namibia: Conservation in Action is a nine-day trip from July 8 to 16 next year and includes stays at five different properties.\nThrough the course of the trip, guests join the field team of Dr. Julian Fennessy, one of the world’s leading giraffe experts, on an expedition to collar and examine the animal in the wild, track the rare black rhino on foot and learn about efforts to conserve it during a visit to the Save the Rhino Trust headquarters, and track cheetahs on foot through tall grass, led by guides equipped with transponders that monitor the animals’ radio collars. Travelers also get close with leopards on a trip to Okonjima’s AfriCat Foundation , an organization that helps protect big cats in the region.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
