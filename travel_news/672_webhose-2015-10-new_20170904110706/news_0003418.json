With the decorations down, the Christmas tree shedding its last needles in the street and drizzle streaking the windows, the mental image of swaying palm trees and whooshing waves is never more potent. Happily, the Caribbean is waiting to help, clad in its best high-season apparel. Of course, high season can mean high prices, and a squeeze on availability. But if Jamaica is sold out, there are less obvious and more cost-effective places for a break in the sun – from the shores of Africa to the tropical edge of Thailand. 19C-24C Bermuda Max temp: 22C Hours of sunshine per day: 5 Sea temp: 20C Lying too far north to share the blazing warmth which envelops the Caribbean at the start of the year (it shares its latitude with Morocco and South Carolina), Bermuda can still rouse itself to the pleasing low 20s in January. You do not go to Bermuda for hip bars or to seek the latest trends; but this island has been labeled a paradise since the 17th century It has an inviting capital in Hamilton, splendid beaches along its south coast (such as Horseshoe Bay), and the British seafaring heritage of the Royal Naval Dockyard – and is also a haven for golfers. Your Golf Travel (0800 043 6644; yourgolftravel.com ) offers breaks at the five-star Fairmont Southampton in the south-west of the island – where an 18-hole par-three course is part of the complex. A seven-night stay in January, with flights and four rounds, costs from £1539, room only. Florida Max temp: 24C Hours of sunshine per day: 7 Sea temp: 24C In some ways, January is the best time to visit America’s “Sunshine State”. The crowds that descend later in the year are absent, but you can still enjoy temperatures in the low 20s – whether you head for Miami on the east coast, Tampa on the west or Orlando in the middle. The sunny skies of Miami Beach, attracting snowbirds for a century Photo: Ap/ Fotolia America As You Like It (020 8742 8299; americaasyoulikeit.com ) suggests a “Florida Discovery” road trip which takes 21 days to explore the state – via Orlando, Miami and its neighbour Fort Lauderdale, the Florida Keys and the Gulf island of Sanibel. From £1259 per person (two sharing), with flights, car hire and accommodation. Gran Canaria Max temp: 20C Hours of sunshine per day: 7 Sea temp: 19C The central piece in the Canarian jigsaw has an appeal which veers from the unhurried beach days available at Playa del Inglés to the desert-like landscape of the Maspalomas sand dunes and the sub-tropical foliage of Palmitos Park – where parrots squawk in the boughs. Las Palmas, Spain's ninth-largest city has a cosmopolitan character, the legacy of a unique maritime history Photo: Alamy But whatever you decide to see, the island is pleasantly warm in January. First Choice (0871 200 7799; firstchoice.co.uk ) features the Hotel Tabaiba in Maspalomas – a five-star hideaway with four swimming pools.

Crane Beach, above, on the south-east coast of Barbados, is one of the island's finest stretches of sand Travelbag (0871 402 1638; travelbag.co.uk) proffers decadent escapes to the Fairmont Royal Pavilion – a five-star, near Holetown, which comes equipped with two gourmet restaurants, a spa and kayaks for use in the waters which nuzzle its beach. A seven-night break, flying direct from Gatwick on January 16, costs from £2096 per person (two sharing) – including breakfast. Réunion Max temp: 27C Hours of sunshine per day: 7 Sea temp: 27C The least acclaimed of the sunshine boltholes in the Indian Ocean cannot boast the easy familiarity of the Maldives or Mauritius, but it can claim to be gloriously Gallic. Réunion boasts a rugged and mountainous landscape, and Gallic flavour Réunion is as fine a location for intrepid travel as it is for woozy weeks on the beach – its rugged appearance summed up by its colossal, ferociously active volcano Piton de la Fournaise (which has erupted this year). Rainbow Tours (020 3131 4927; rainbowtours.co.uk ) sells a “Reunion Island Walking Holiday” – a nine-day self-guided itinerary which wanders up to the Salazie caldera at the heart of the island, but also manages three nights on the west coast, on the soft curve of Boucan Canot.

Baja California Max temp: 25C Hours of sunshine per day: 7 Sea temp: 23C This narrow peninsula, extending south from the lower edge of California, just below San Diego, is Mexico’s most fabulous sunshine enclave – dragging Hollywood stars from Los Angeles to the genteel hotels of Cabo San Lucas, at its southern tip. A cove on the Sea of Cortez Photo: AP But as well as being a place for gilded getaways, Baja California is an oceanic playground – framed by the Pacific and the Gulf of California. Audley Travel (01993 838 670; audleytravel.com ) offers “Cruising Baja California” – an 11-day holiday dominated by a seven-night voyage on the little Safari Endeavour, which allows for kayaking, paddle-boarding and whale-watching in the Gulf. Cabins are available in January, from £3470 per person with flights. Dubai Max temp: 25C Hours of sunshine per day: 8 Sea temp: 23C The most glitzy of the United Arab Emirates is arguably at its most attractive in January – when the fierce Middle Eastern sun is muzzled by the newness of the year, yet still has sufficient power to deliver temperatures in the mid-20s. Dubai's first five-star hotel opened in 1975. Now there are scores Elegant Resorts (01244 897 111; elegantresorts.co.uk ) dispenses luxurious holidays at the Four Seasons Jumeirah Beach – a five-star palace with a spa, three swimming pools, 10 restaurants and bars, and direct access to 270 metres of sumptuous beachfront.

Phuket is Thailand?s largest island, with a curvaceous coastline of wide beaches strung between jutting peninsulas and craggy rock formations Accommodation options are many.

Then it is on to the south coast, to peer at the Pacific at Boca Chica. Prices from £4950 per person (two sharing) – including all flights. Namibia Max temp: 30C Hours of sunshine per day: 6 Sea temp: 19C South Africa’s neighbour can often go unheralded – despite offering a fascinating mix of German heritage in its capital Windhoek, desert sparseness on its incomparable Skeleton Coast and roaring wildlife in Etosha National Park.
