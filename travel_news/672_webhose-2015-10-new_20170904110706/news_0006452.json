This new CEO is the Engineer Mohamed Mubarak Al Mazrouei. He replaced Tony Douglas who went back to the UK to work for that countryâ€™s Defense Ministry. \nThe focus and vision of the new CEO is to make sure the Midfield Terminal Building at the Abu Dhabi International Airport is kept on schedule so it will enhance the airports ability to handle the more than 27 million passengers that airport has passing through its gate annually now. At this time the midfield project is 45% complete and is on schedule. \nThe terminal building itself is 700,000 square meters in size or 7,534,737 square feet. This new building along with the associated runway will increase the capacity of the airport to handle passengers from 20 million last year to over 40 million once completed.
