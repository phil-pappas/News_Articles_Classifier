Nassetta, president and CEO of Hilton Worldwide, was inducted into the Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor at the University of Houston Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management on October 21, 2015. \nHospitality industry leaders from across the globe were on hand for the occasion, which was planned and executed in cooperation with a team of Hilton College student managers and volunteers. \nNassetta spent two days meeting and encouraging students at the College and describing the ladder of opportunity within the industry. As one of the largest and the fastest growing global hospitality companies, Hilton is committed to creating opportunities for youth around the world. \nThe induction dinner included a four-course meal designed by Hilton Worldwide’s Corporate Chef Mark Ehrler and top chefs from Hilton properties in Dallas and Houston. \nQuoting Hilton’s founder, Conrad Hilton, Nassetta said, “I believe in luck, but the kind of luck that I believe in has to do with people,” in his remarks. Nassetta continued, “Nothing inspires me more than spending time with our teams around the world and it is to our Hilton team members that I would like to dedicate this honor tonight. They are truly deserving of it and their commitment and unparalleled passion for their jobs are two of the biggest reasons I can claim to be so fortunate.” \nThe event also featured the grand opening of the Hilton Legacy Exhibit, a special exhibit of the College’s Hospitality Industry Archives commemorating the Hilton legacy and its century-long influence on the industry. \nThe Hospitality Industry Hall of Honor, celebrating its 20th anniversary, was created to recognize industry leaders who have made extraordinary contributions to American and international business and society. Nassetta is the Hall of Honor’s 67th inductee.
