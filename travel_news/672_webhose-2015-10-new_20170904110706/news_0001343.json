Reservations are required, and guided tours are recommended. \nFor more information, visit en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71499/Musee-des-gouts-de-Paris Travel By Michelle Locke ASSOCIATED PRESS • Sunday October 18, 2015 5:00 AM \nPARIS — Forget Versailles, the Eiffel Tower and French fashion. \nWhen I want to be impressed by a marvel of Parisian design, I head to the Musee des Egouts — the Sewer Museum. \nSure, not everyone appreciates the appeal of the city’s subterranean spectacle. \nBut, as tour guide Jean-Charles Pintori put it, “They are wrong!” \nI visited the museum on a summer day when the temperature topped 100 degrees — a fine place to be, it turned out. \nTucked deep underground, the museum maintains an even temperature, and the ambience, though a little smelly in parts, isn’t overwhelming. \nExhibits trace the history of Parisian sewage from the Middle Ages, when streets had drains for wastewater in the middle, to the current incarnation, which got a major overhaul in the mid-19th century. \nThe current system is unusual in that it also includes conduits for drinking water, handles rain runoff and houses telecommunications cables. \nDisplays of equipment — some antique, some current — show the tools used to keep the tunnels clear; workers remove about 15,000 cubic meters of solid waste a year. \nSome families have worked in the sewers for generations and are proud of their public service. Most are men, but about a half-dozen are women. \nWriter Victor Hugo called the sewers “that wonderful underground city” and used them as the setting for Jean Valjean’s dramatic rescue of Marius in Les Miserables . A picture of the rescue can be found in the museum along with a map showing the sewers as they were in the early 1800s, at the time the novel is set. \nPeople aren’t the only creatures traveling the tunnels, as a glass case full of stuffed rats suggests. Our tour paused at a storm drain to see whether we could spot one. We did not. \nA display of antique swords caught my eye. Apparently at some point, someone somewhere tossed them, and into the sewer they went. \nAs Pintori noted: The sewers are “the intestines of Paris. Everything comes through here.” \nModern-day Parisians are more likely to lose keys than fencing foils down storm drains. If that happens, they can call a number to ask a worker to look for the lost possessions. About 3,000 such operations are performed each year, officials say, with a success rate of 80 percent. \nLike any good museum tour, this one ends at the gift shop — where you can buy mementoes, including stuffed (toy) rats. \nUnlike most other museum tours, departing visitors are admonished to wash their hands — so they are sure to leave with only memories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:36:06.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
