Volaris expects to end the year with 56 aircraft. \nStrong Cash Flow Generation, Solid Balance Sheet and Good Liquidity \nThe net increase of cash and cash equivalents was Ps.380 million during the third quarter, mainly driven by the resources provided by operating activities of Ps.243 million. \nAs of September 30, 2015, Volaris had a balance of Ps.4,408 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, representing 26% of the last twelve month operating revenues. Volaris recorded negative net debt (or a positive net cash position) of Ps.2,954 million and total equity of Ps.6,196 million. \nDuring the third quarter, Volaris incurred capital expenditures of Ps.262 million, which included pre-delivery payments for acquisition of aircraft and rotable spare parts, furniture and equipment for Ps.244 million and intangibles assets for Ps.18 million. These acquisitions were offset by reimbursements of aircraft pre-delivery payments of Ps.270 million, and proceeds from disposals of rotable spare parts, furniture and equipment of Ps.78 million. \nActive in Fuel Risk Management \nVolaris has continued to remain active in its fuel risk management program. Volaris hedged 45% of its third quarter fuel consumption at an average strike price of US $2.07 per gallon, which combined with the 55% unhedged consumption, resulted in a blended average economic fuel cost of US$1.68 per gallon for the quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:00:12.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
