Picture: Nicole Ashley Squires Source: Supplied \nSquires said when she opened her bag after she arrived at her hotel, a beer can rolled out. \n“When I opened it a beer fell out. I was like ‘Oh no, I have someone else’s luggage.’ Then I started going through it and I’m picking up men’s clothes,” she told CBC News . \n“Not just a random shirt or jeans — a full outfit.” \nShe said the clothes smelt awful. \n“I’m not exaggerating. These clothes are soiled.” Nicole Ashley Squires opened her luggage to find men’s clothing and cans of beer. Picture: Nicole Ashley Squires Source: Supplied \nConcerned about how the clothes and beer came to be there, and worrying about a possible safety risk, Squires called WestJet. \nShe didn’t get the reaction she expected. \n“They were like ‘Oh gross, no way,’” she said. “They were so cavalier about it. They didn’t really care.” \nWorrying that she might be overreacting, Squires posted a picture of the mystery clothes on Twitter, asking WestJet to explain. \nThe airline then posted a second tweet asking Squires to call. \nAfter a phone discussion she received an email from WestJet spokesman Robert Palmer. \nHe said baggage crew spotted the items sitting next to Squires’s bag on the conveyor belt and because her bag was slightly unzipped, they assumed the objects had spilt out, so they packed it all in there. \n“As weird as it sounds, that’s what happened. We are very sorry that our guest found items in her bag that did not belong to her, but they were put there by people with the best of intentions who were only trying to help. We appreciate her understanding.” \nSquires said from now on she will be locking her luggage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:45:53.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
