AMELIA ROMANOS Last updated 11:15, October 22 2015 DAMIR SAGOLJ/REUTERS \nMalaysia Airlines planes are seen on the tarmac at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. \nThere's a certain \"eek\" expression that comes with travel talk about Germanwings, Malaysia Airlines and other companies linked to air disasters. \nI saw it first hand when a couple of friends flew Malaysia Airlines to Bali a few weeks after flight MH370 disappeared in 2014. \nThey'd paid for their travel before it happened and didn't seriously consider cancelling, but the airline was clearly not a forgotten detail as they headed off. \nI saw the expression again recently when a colleague told me she was flying from Croatia to London with Germanwings. \nShe booked the flight months after the French Alps crash, and cost was apparently a deciding factor. \nAnother workmate said given the choice, and a couple of dollars difference, she would have chosen another airline. \nI faced the decision in December when a travel agent, booking my flight from London to New Zealand, hesitantly asked if I would mind flying Malaysia Airlines. \nThis was after the airline's second tragedy, the shooting down of MH17 over Ukraine, so it must have become policy for them to ask.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:27:11.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
