No wonder UK borrowers are feeling overwhelmed. “The alternative finance space has grown at a phenomenal rate in the past year, but the sheer number of platforms is daunting,” says Funding Centre’s David Stevenson. So where do you go when the bank says no? Peer-to-Peer lending Last January RBS released figures that show P2P lending to small businesses is increasing 200 per cent every year. One of the biggest reasons for this is that P2P recognises the need for speed: “Business owners get quick decisions and access to funds within days, not weeks,” says Giles Andrews, co-founder of consumer lending platform Zopa. “We expect P2P to take 50 per cent market share of the personal loans market over the next five to 10 years.” Mark Williams from RateSetter, says P2P embraces quirky and tech-led companies: “P2P lenders can look at more unusual business models – pop-up restaurants for example, but we’ve also lent to businesses whose assets aren’t tangible things like machinery or property: lots of online businesses don’t have assets like these, and have a very hard time borrowing from traditional financial institutions as a result. We can assess businesses on their own merits.” Equity crowdfunding Skint but sitting on an Einstein of an idea? Crowdfunding is a godsend for the entrepreneurial creative. Recent high-profile cases such as the Camden Town Brewery, which almost doubled its initial target to raise £2.7m, have drawn start-ups to this kind of lending. Location-dependent SMEs can grow quickly with crowdfunding, as shown by Camden Town Brewery, which rewarded its local investors with free beer parties. Emma Jones from SME networking site Enterprise Nation says crowdfunding doubles as a great profile raiser: “The crowd become marketing agents for the product or service in which they’ve just invested or backed.” Business angels and venture capitalists Business is still booming for those “business angels” in the UK hungry for the next big thing. Most individual “angels” invest around £25k and usually stick around a bit longer than venture capitalists, who normally put in around £1m but get in and out much quicker. If you really want that Dragons’ Den feel, try out a “speed-funding” event such as Angels Den, where start-ups have three minutes to pitch an idea. Specialist lenders While P2P requires an established trading history, specialist lenders can kick-start your SME from scratch. Conrad Ford, chief executive officer of Funding Options, says the majority of SME alternative finance activity he sees comes from specialist lenders giving short-term capital. “We had a case recently where someone wanted to open up a pie shop in a small seaside town in the east of England, but she was starting from scratch, so we put her in touch with a small specialist alternative lender who helped with a cash flow loan for initial rent and stock,” he says. Bridging loans While there is a premium for this type of funding, deals can be lucrative for both sides. Typically, bridging loan companies want their funds back within a 12-month period, but this gives the SME the opportunity to use the investment, after which a bank can come in and fund something with a track record. Business entrepreneur and investor Jamie McGilvray believes alternative finance is here to stay. “I don't see anything changing in the short term with the banks’ lending criteria, because there is still so much media coverage of how the banks acted in the past and recklessly lost money. Underwriters are too busy covering their backs to do the right deals for customers.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • How to avoid cyber-attacks • Should small businesses borrow money to grow? • A first sight of the Small Business Saturday 100 • How to pitch to a Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:27:36.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
