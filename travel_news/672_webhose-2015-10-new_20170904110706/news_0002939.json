This growth can be attributed to better efficiency and performance offered by disc brakes, when compared to drum brakes. However, the drum brakes segment still dominates the commercial vehicle segment.\nThe electronically assisted brake (EAB) systems have gained more popularity with the introduction of stringent safety regulations. The technologies such as ABS and ESC, have been mandated in majority of the Western countries, and are expected to be regulated in developing countries such as India , China , and Brazil in next few years. This has boosted the demand for these technologies and the market size by value for these technologies is projected to grow at a CAGR of 9.36% during the forecast period.\nTechnological advancements have revolutionized the braking system in various transportation industries. The introduction of electronic braking system in automotive sector as well as locomotive & rolling stock has brought about great change in the industry. The electro-pneumatic braking system market is projected to grow rapidly from 2015 to 2020 to acquire majority of the share by 2020.\nThe global brake system market for off-highway vehicles is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.28% during the forecast period. Asia-Oceania is estimated to hold majority of the shares in the brake system market for off-highway vehicles. Increased activities in primary sectors of an economy such as mining and agriculture, and secondary sectors such as infrastructure development, have led to a growing demand for off-highway vehicles.\nSome of the key global brake system manufacturers include ZF TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. (U.S.), Continental AG ( Germany ), Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd. ( Japan ), Knorr-Bremse ( Germany ), and Akebono Brake Industry Co. Ltd. ( Japan ). These companies comprise the largest share of the brake market.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1 Introduction\n2 Research Methodology\n3 Executive Summary\n4 Premium Insights\n5 Market Overview\n6 Off-Highway Brake System Market\n7 Locomotive & Rolling Stock Brake Market\n8 Automotive Electronically Assisted Brake (EAB) System Market\n9 Automotive Brake Market, By Region\n10 Competitive Landscape\n11 Company Profiles\n- Aisin Seiki Co.
