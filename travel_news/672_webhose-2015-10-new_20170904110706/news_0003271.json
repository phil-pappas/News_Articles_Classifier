When railroad crossing arms are down or the warning lights are flashing, drivers and pedestrians must wait for the passing train. But last year, Federal Railroad Administration statistics reveal 915 people nationwide were killed or injured trespassing on railroad property.\nUnion Pacific Railroad this week launched a new campaign exclusively on social media, urging drivers and pedestrians to think about their personal safety first and wait at grade crossings. New videos depict different scenarios in which a jogger, young couple and father and son are stopped, waiting for a train to pass. When the arms lift, each proceeds safely toward a spectacular future.\n“Our message is straightforward — Your Life is Worth the Wait,” said Scott Moore, Union Pacific senior vice president — Corporate Relations. “Union Pacific trains operate in more than 7,300 communities; too often our employees see drivers or pedestrians sneak around the gates. Even after applying the emergency brakes, it can take a mile for a train to stop; the risk is never worth it.”\nThis is Union Pacific’s second safety campaign launched exclusively on social media this year. The first, addressed high school photography on railroad tracks.\nSource:- Uprr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:47:55.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
