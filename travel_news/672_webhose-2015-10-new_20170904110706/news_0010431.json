We were so well looked after by FoodShow, thank you all.” Over 150 event professionals attended the launch including representatives from Prince’s Trust, Kaya Festival, The Gorilla Organisation and Pret a Manger. On arrival guests were shown to the recently refurbished Great Hall uplit in a vibrant pink hue. A circular bar in the centre of the room provided sumptuous cocktails including spicy watermelon and vodka and fresh passion fruit and mint mojito.
