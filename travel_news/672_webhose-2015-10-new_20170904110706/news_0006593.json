The news resulted in angry protests from some workers who attacked two of the airline’s executives earlier this month.\n\"The 'Plan B' takes place over two years, 2016 and 2017. For 2016 it is under way,\" said de Juniac. \"If negotiations are successful by the start of 2016, we can avoid implementing 'Plan B' for 2017.\"\nAir France will discuss the 2016 cuts with union officials at a meeting of its works council on Thursday.\nLast week, de Juniac told the ACTE conference in Paris that the images of assistant HR director Xavier Broseta having his shirt ripped from his back and being escorted over a fence were “catastrophic” for its image.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:46:11.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
