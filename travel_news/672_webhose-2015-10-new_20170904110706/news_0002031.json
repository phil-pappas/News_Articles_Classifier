The average fuel economy (window-sticker value) of new vehicles sold in the in August was 25.3 mpg, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. \nWhile it's great that Tesla's Model X and its falcon-wing doors are going to be able to drive for 250 miles before charging, it's also not going to be here until late 2016 at the earliest. And while it's great that the Model 3 will be about $30,000 when it arrives, Tesla hasn't even mentioned a release date for it in a while. That leaves the current crop of vehicles about halfway to the benchmark that the EPA and Department of Transportation set back in 2012. However, Tesla isn't the only one falling short in the race to higher fuel efficiency. The Chevrolet Bolt that General Motors announced at the Detroit Auto Show more than a year ago claims it will offer 200 miles of electric range for $30,000 after incentives, but is still more concept than reality. \nMaybe instead of looking for the splashiest new electric vehicle, we should take a closer look at the incremental gains being made by the crop that's already out there. Yes, range is lacking, but their efficiency and amenities are starting to stack up. With help from the EPA's FuelEconomy.gov site, we compiled a list of the most fuel-efficient electric vehicles on the road. They aren't all Tesla-caliber quite yet, but they're drifting into its class when viewed through the right lens: 1 of 11", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:07:25.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
