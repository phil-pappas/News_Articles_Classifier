The 186-room Hotel cascades down toward the Atlantic, providing a luxurious retreat inspired by ocean waves and kissed by cool breezes. Most guest rooms and suites have balconies to take in the fresh sea air, while the Hotel’s signature restaurant and lobby lounge face the ocean. \n“With the city centre and financial district just 10 minutes away, it’s hard to imagine that this breezy, resort-like Hotel is in the middle of such a busy urban metropolis,” says General Manager Olivier Thomas, who leads a team of 300 carefully selected staff who are excited to welcome the Hotel’s first guests in the coming weeks. “For business travellers, it’s the perfect home base in the city, and for those on holiday, it’s truly the best of both worlds.” Four Seasons will also welcome local guests from the surrounding Anfa neighbourhood and beyond for business and social events. The Hotel’s restaurants and bars promise a lively atmosphere for gatherings with friends, family and colleagues. Executive Chef Thierry Papillier’s culinary roots will be showcased in Bleu, a contemporary French brasserie featuring a unique elliptical open kitchen and terrace seating that will allow guests to listen to the sea as they savour its bounty. Bleu Bar is adjacent to the restaurant, and guests may also choose Mint, a welcoming lobby lounge offering cocktails and an all-day menu. Another restaurant and lounge, the poolside Latitude 33, will open in April next year. Additional Hotel features include Casablanca’s most lavish Spa plus a fully equipped fitness centre. A 149 square metre (1,604 square foot) resort-style pool and private cabanas will open in 2016. Guests in town to do business will especially appreciate the Hotel’s flexible event spaces, 24-hour business centre and in-room amenities. For families and leisure travellers, or those needing a break from the day’s business, myriad distractions include shopping for traditional wares at the Habous medina and international labels at designer stores and malls, or exploring the city’s historic sites and regional attractions. Day trips to Marrakech can be arranged, and, with ten world-class courses within an hour of the Hotel, golfers will want to be sure to pack their clubs. Now Confirming Reservations as of 1 December 2015: In celebration of its grand opening, Four Seasons Hotel Casablanca is offering the Experience More package with 20% savings off the regular room rate, as well as the brand’s popular Bed and Breakfast package. Booking may be done online or by calling the global reservations team.
