Jamie Feldman Associate Style Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/09/2015 03:40 PM EDT \nLet's face it: trick-or-treating is pretty much the best thing about Halloween . If you live in a city, that sentiment rings even truer. \n\"But I love trick-or-treating in the suburbs!\" you might say. \"The houses are always decorated so nicely and the neighborhood turns into one big haunted playground!\" \nAll that is fine and good, but as any city kid can tell you, there are some serious perks -- and unique truths -- about the urban candy acquisition process. \nThey are: \n1.
