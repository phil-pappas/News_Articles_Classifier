But for some (especially for the crowd-averse), fall—and especially the month of October—is actually the perfect time for a weekend trip. Hotel rates free-fall after Labor Day , the population thins out to a fraction of what it is during the summer, and the weather is still warm enough for nighttime strolls along cobblestoned Main Street.\n“The fall is quieter than the summer, but it’s still full of life,” says New York City–based interior designer (and part-time Nantucket resident) Victoria Hagan. “The water is still warm enough for a swim, and the ocean breezes are divine. I love to drive on the beach out to Great Point to watch the seals.”\nAnother big perk about Nantucket in the fall? “You don’t have to worry about getting a reservation at your favorite restaurants,” says Ryan Chadwick, owner of island favorite The Grey Lady (which also has a Manhattan outpost on Delancey Street on the Lower East Side). Grey Lady’s chef, Dave Nevins, welcomes the fall as a time to experiment with new dishes and to use different ingredients than in the summer. “There are things I make in the fall I would never try to do during summer, which have too many components and would take a lot of time to execute,” he says. “Once things calm down after Labor Day, summer constraints are gone and I can really open the playbook and get creative.”\nHere, an insider’s guide to autumn on Nantucket, with places that are open year-round (or at least until winter).\nEat\nLola 41\nA hot spot for locals, Lola 41 serves everything from sushi to burgers in a contemporary space. There’s also a full bar and inventive cocktail list.\nThe Nautilus\nOpened last year right off of Main Street, it’s already become an island favorite, with a menu of classic New England items given an Asian twist, like the blue crab fried rice with garlic, scallion, and Thai nam jim sauce.\nIsland Kitchen\nBreakfast is especially popular here, namely the omelets, eggs Benedict, and roasted turkey hash.\nThe Grey Lady\nThe fall menu includes grilled flounder with parsnip puree, Swiss chard, and mustard cream—though there’s always a near-perfect lobster roll for purists.\nDrink\nCisco Brewers\nA casual spot with a beer hall–like atmosphere, it also has a great wine list and cocktail menu and weekly live music acts.\nThe Proprietors Bar & Table\nThe unusual—and unusually named—cocktails (like the “Verde, Genuine, Edenic” made with fair-trade quinoa vodka, field arugula syrup, and kale and lemon juices) are reason enough to stop by this restaurant, housed in a historic white-clapboard house downtown.\nShop\nGypsy\nA womenswear boutique opened by stylist Paola Gonfrade, Gypsy carries designers like Baja East , Haider Ackermann , Thakoon , and The Elder Statesman .\nMurray’s Toggery Shop\nThe only place a local will get a pair of Nantucket Reds, Murray’s has been a staple on the island for the past 70 years.\nDo\nWhaling Museum\nNantucket’s history is defined by the whaling industry of the 1800s. You’ll learn everything you’d want to know here. (And there’s an epic sperm whale skeleton hanging from the ceiling.)\nSankaty Head Lighthouse\nKeep the nautical theme going with a trip to the island’s most iconic lighthouse, which was originally built in 1850. Still in use today, it sits atop the (sometimes windy—bring a Windbreaker) Sankaty Head Bluff above the Atlantic Ocean, offering up some of the most Instagram -worthy shots on Nantucket.\nBike Rides\nThere’s no better way to tour Nantucket than on a bicycle. There are miles and miles of paved, flat bike paths that make it easy to explore the wetlands, beaches, harbor, dunes, and wildlife (almost half of the island is protected and preserved land). Two popular rides include journeys from the downtown historic district to Sconset or Madaket, both of which, while long, are relatively easy. Rentals are available from Young’s Bicycle Shop —in business for almost 85 years—where the helpful staff can tell you exactly where to go and what to see.\nStay\nWhite Elephant\nThe gold standard of Nantucket luxury hotels, the 67-room White Elephant sits right along the harbor and is a quick walk to Main Street.\n21 Broad\nOpened last year, the 27-room 21 Broad was conceived as a place for visitors who want a more modern Nantucket experience (there are iPads and 40-inch LED smart TVs in every room, for instance), designed with bright pops of yellow and turquoise against a predominantly white background.", "external_links": ["http://nautilusnantucket.com/", "http://www.nantucketreds.com/", "http://www.greyladyack.com/", "http://lola41.com/", "http://ciscobrewers.com/verify?return=/", "http://www.proprietorsnantucket.com/", "https://www.21broadhotel.com/"], "published": "2015-10-20T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:34:45.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
