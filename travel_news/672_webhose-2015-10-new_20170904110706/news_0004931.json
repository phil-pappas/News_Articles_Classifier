Picture: Blick.\nRowena Ryan Escape EVER wondered what really goes on in the cockpit? A new video lets you feel like the pilot with a 360 degree view of takeoff, mid-flight and landing of a Swiss Airlines flight from Zurich to Geneva.\nThe five-and-a-half minute video was filmed by German YouTube channel Blick and shows Flight commander Luc Wolfensberger and First Officer Martin Radinger in action from taxiing to takeoff and landing as they fly 250 passengers on the Airbus A320 at 39,000 feet.\nYou can listen as the pilots communicate with the control towers, make an announcement to passengers and point out sights along the way such as Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc.\nUse the arrows to make your way around the cockpit from looking out the front windows of the plane to looking back at the pilots as they control the aircraft and watch as they perfectly land at Geneva airport in Switzerland.\nWatch the plane takeoff and land from the view of a pilot.
