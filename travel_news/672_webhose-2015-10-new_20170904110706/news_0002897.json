In a submission to the government the BBC will admit that the trust is no longer seen as a \"credible and independent\" regulator and suggest that its responsibilities should be transferred to an internal regulator . It comes after the BBC Trust was heavily criticised for its handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal and a series of multi-million pound pay-offs at the corporation. It has been accused of a conflict of interest because it acts as both a \"cheerleader and regulator\" for the corporation. The BBC will also say in it's 100-page submission to the government that the corporation's Royal Charter should be extended to 11 years to stop decisions on its future being influenced by the run up to general elections. Ministers are understood to be preparing to cut the period between royal charters from 10 years to five in a bid to ensure greater scrutiny of its funding and remit. The BBC's submission means it is now almost certain that the trust will be abolished in the Royal Charter review next year. It will warn against cutting or reducing the £145.50 licence fee amid concerns that a move to a subscription-based service for premium content could create a \"two tier BBC\" A BBC source said: \"The BBC is an asset for Britain. One that will have to change and evolve, but at the heart of that change must be the recognition that the public don’t want a narrowly focused BBC. They want one that produces great programmes and offers Britain a strong voice abroad. “While the future governance and regulation of the BBC must be strong with clear lines of accountability, it is also important that the BBC retains its independence from Government. “We want to continue to work constructively with Government to ensure the public has a BBC they can continue to be proud of.” • BBC Trust could be stripped of power to rule over allegations of bias, Culture Secretary says The corporation will also commit to cutting its budget by a fifth between 2016 and 2021 while increasing commercial revenues by 15 per cent. It will say it is open to partnerships with local newspapers and arts organisations, but warn that any commitments should not be used as a \"form of to-slicing\". In the submission to the government's consultation, the BBC suggests that it should be regulated by an independent body. It has been suggested that the role of Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, could be expanded to cover the corporation . It will also recommend the formation of a BBC board to run the corporation. It comes after John Whittingdale , the Culture Secretary, said that the BBC will be stripped of its power to adjudicate on allegations of political bias in its coverage. Culture Secretary John Whittingham Photo: REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth Speaking at the Conservative party conference in Manchester earlier this week, he said that it must no longer be the case “that if you make a complaint against the BBC, the decision on whether it is justified is taken by the BBC”. In his address to Tory conference, Mr Whittingdale said the BBC was the finest broadcaster in the world at its best, but claimed many people feel it had “not always been as fair and impartial as it should [be]”. @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:39:58.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
