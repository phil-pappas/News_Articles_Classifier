With this launch, Travel Agents who enroll or are already enrolled in the ACTA Campus can learn more about Air Canada, the global network of destinations and its suite of products starting with the introductory module on Air Canada rouge.\n \nRob Puzzo, Manager, Alliances Sales Strategy and Sales Effectiveness for Air Canada stated, “Air Canada is proud to partner with ACTA and leverage the Travel Learning Campus to offer one more tool to the Canadian agency community. We believe that this tool will help all agents – whether they are new to the industry or not – better understand the Air Canada family and the many Air Canada products. We look forward to engaging with our agency partners using this tool.”\n \nThe Air Canada training modules will lead Travel Agents through a tiered incentive program where participants can earn badges on their way to attaining levels of certification as an Air Canada Product Specialist. Levels of certification range from Bronze to Platinum, the most prestigious certification. Rob also shared that, “We will be announcing additional Air Canada learning content and badge achievement incentive details in coming weeks.” To kick off the training program, the first 100 agents to successfully complete the Air Canada rouge module will receive a $25 Apple gift card.\n \nACTA Chair, Mary Jane Hiebert added, “With airlines continuing to challenge Travel Agents with new incentive models, it brings us some comfort to see Air Canada reinvesting in the Travel Agent community through continuing education and challenging Travel Agents to learn more and earn more. Just as we urge our members to charge service fees for the high level of service standards they provide, we also feel that an investment must be made into continuing education. If we invest in learning new products we can leverage the information to up sell and offer clients the best experience available. This should lead to larger returns.”\n \nSimon Gilmartin, Co-Founder of Travel Learning Campuses added, “I applaud ACTA and Air Canada for their commitment to agent education. This program aligns perfectly with the vision of the Travel Learning Campus which is to enable performance, productivity and profitability by providing a high quality standard to online training and development that will support growth of sales and industry professionalism”.\n \nIn the coming months visitors to the ACTA campus will enjoy additional courses and campus enhancements. By the end of 2015, members can expect the ACTA campus to include more from Air Canada, CTC/CTM prep courses as well as BC and SK Insurance licensing exams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:41:46.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
