One of the channel's young hosts, Alex Hermansson, sings with teenagers and pulls on the tampons' strings to make them dance like marionettes before submerging them in a glass of red-coloured water. HOORAY FOR PERIODS!! The first verse goes: \"It's a thing that happens to girls sometimes/ They don't want to talk about it/ Maybe they're a bit ashamed/ They don't want us to know anything at all/ But we know, that it, it's something totally normal/ We just need to be a little extra nice to them/ Show a little patience/ It's just a little blood.\" \"Period, period, hip hip hooray for period!/ The body's working as it should/ And that is really, really good — hooray!\" it continues, as red drops splatter on the screen and are painted in the background. Menstruation \"is a sign that as of now the body can create a life,\" Hermansson told the daily Expressen . A clip produced and aired by SVT in January featured animated male and female genitals, called \"Snoppen och Snippan\" in Swedish and translated into English as \"Willie and Twinkle\". It has been viewed on YouTube more than 6.4 million times. That clip was intended as an educational tool, and was made after the word \"snippan\" was invented by a group of women who were dismayed by the lack of an acceptable slang term for vagina. The clip divided opinion worldwide due to the realistic representation of the sexual organs. \"The Period Song\" is available here . advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:49:22.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
