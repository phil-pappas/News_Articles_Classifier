Although green architecture has strived to make less of an impact on the environment, there continues to be a complete disconnect of nature within the design. There has never been more of a need to directly connect individuals with nature. The thoughtful design of the new 57 guest rooms at The Lodge at Woodloch strives to do just that. According to the 14 Patterns of Biophilic Design a Terrapin Green Report, biophilic design is known to be organized into three categories, nature in the space, natural analogues and nature of the space. Nature in the Space includes the inclusion of plant life, water, non-visual signs like sounds and scents and more. The Lodge has taken unique steps from its inception to ensure that Nature in the Space is part of the overall experience throughout the property and is now enhancing that within the guest rooms. Enhancing the rooms with life energy will be bud vases with fresh flower or herb clippings from the garden as well as Himalayan Sea Salt Lamps. All rooms are located with direct views of either the 15-acre private lake or the rock water feature from the private verandas in each room. Additionally, bird feeders, the Pollinator Garden and a new Chakra Garden are also visible from select guest rooms and other areas on property will support the theory of Nature in the Space. Natural Analogues- evocations of nature within the space. The new guest rooms feature drapes with a Pussy Willow pattern woven in, wallpaper with the look and texture of tree bark, pillows and throws that reflect flowers and plant life of northeast Pennsylvania. The colors were selected to reflect our mountain surroundings while providing a sanctuary for relaxation and rest. Nature of the Space reflects the innate and learned desire to see beyond one's immediate surroundings. One's fascination with the unknown. Each room features a private veranda which provides prospect and refuge. The feeling of safety, security and privacy while allowing a beautiful prospect of the forest. It is both powerful and restorative. \nSome of the distinctive nature inspired design aspects of the redesigned guest rooms include: The new bed which creates a centerpiece and sanctuary within each guest room and suite: Warm and inviting Heirloom Cherry Bed frames help frame the bed as the centerpiece of the room in all king-bedded rooms and suites. Double-bedded rooms and suites feature an aged stone finished iron bed. Additional lush pillows have been added to make the restful harbor even more inviting. Each guest room and suite has been equipped with a Therapedic EcoGel2 Mattress which offers hourglass design for additional support and gel technology for cooling benefits. The throw blanket that will punctuate the bed is an eco-friendly, anti-microbial and dynamically conducive (good for hot and cold climates) sourced from Studio Twist. \nFurniture Highlights: Custom Big Sur Decorative Mirrors by Roost will help reflect the natural surroundings viewed from the veranda in each guest room and suite. Each mirror was made to order and like the trees they came from, no two mirrors are the same. The in-room desks have been compacted slightly from the previous desks. The new distressed black oak desks and adjoining dresser and in-room refrigerator cabinet are custom made by American Atelier, Inc. in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The desks, now centered in the room were reconfigured to serve as multi-functional creative space to practice one's newly found talents of sketching (and other art forms from the Creative Discovery Programs), journaling, or if absolutely needed, staying connected to work and the outside world. Suites feature a new Zen Sleeper sofa in Pala Cocoa which was selected to provide the utmost in comfort. The Zen Mattress showcases an 8.5\" pillow top and a patented z-coil spring system. \nDécor: The new artwork features photography from throughout the property by Andrea Killam Photography and Christopher King at Endless Echo. \"Bringing the feeling of our fern-carpeted woodlands into the guest room helps us to celebrate our muse in Mother Nature, explained General Manager, Robert Baldassari. The new lighting collection includes a Five-Element Bedside Lamp which helps create a sense of balance in the space. The lamp features copper accents (metal element), hand-carved slate base (earth element), a light bulb (fire element) housed in a rippled glass globe giving a watery effect (water element) surrounded by the linen shade (wood element). The Montclair collection floor lamps include a raffia textured shade. Discrete bedside reading lights have been added as well which add to the functionality without distracting from the design. \nNew natural elements bring life energy into the rooms: Bud vases featuring seasonal fresh clipped flowers or herbs from one of the three on-property gardens have been added to each guest room to help bring life energy into each room. The selection of flowers and herbs were hand-selected by Master Gardner Alison Peck and her team which reflect the nature surrounding the property. Himalayan Salt Lamps have been introduced into each room in order to provide an ambient night light (if desired) as well as natural air purification. \nCommode: The bathroom wall covering brings the texture of nature with two complimentary colors and designs of wallpaper. The first accent wall features a deep brown Misaki Collection Walnut Branch design. The remaining walls feature Hana Oak Moss collection wall paper which evokes the texture of birch bark. New teak benches and back-lit make-up mirrors enhance the bathroom further. \nThe design of the rooms was a collaboration between Patricia Kiesendahl of Woodloch Resorts and Design and Supply, a Pennsylvania-based hospitality support firm.
