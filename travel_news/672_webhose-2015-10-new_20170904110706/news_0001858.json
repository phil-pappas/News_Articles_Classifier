Richard Drew / AP (left) and Mario Anzuoni / Reuters Previous -- of -- Next Terrence Howard as Ted Wells: Many say the pure acting chops of Howard's \"Hustle & Flow\" is enough to secure the role of lead Deflategate investigator Ted Wells. But sometimes a good mustache can get you places in this world. Handout photo (left) and Damian Dovarganes / AP Previous -- of -- Next Denis Leary as Bill Belichick: Sarcastic? Check. Unwilling to suffer fools lightly? Check. Experience playing a head coach on the big screen... the Browns even! Check. Slam dunk casting.
