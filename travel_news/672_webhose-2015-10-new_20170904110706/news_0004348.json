We are travelling to the Gold Coast in November and was just wondering what is the best way for a family to travel around for seven days? We are arriving in Coolangatta and hoping to spend a lot of time at the theme parks. \nA. November is a fantastic time to head to the Gold Coast. The weather is beautiful at that time of year. If you're there for seven days and you're travelling with kids, the most convenient way to get around is by hiring a car. Some of the parks are right next to each other (such as Movie World and Wet'n'Wild) while others are a bit isolated and further away (such as Sea World or Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary). Be sure to hire a car with GPS or purchase a good map before you get to the car hire company, as sometimes they have limited stock. \nMake sure you buy your tickets before you get to the parks to avoid long queues. There are options available to avoid the ride queues and they are well worth the money if you want to do lots of rides multiple times â€“ ask your travel agent for more details. \nBe sure to save some time for the incredible white sand beaches and a day trip to Currumbin for a fabulous experience of Australian wildlife. \n- Tanya Aitken, owner operator, House of Travel Papamoa \nGot a travel question?
