The team beat a side from Ukrainian charter company Windrose 5-4 in the final, having entered the tournament for the first time this year.\nAnd Oman Air goalkeeper Harub was named Best Goalkeeper of 2015, after stopping every ball that threatened to cross the goal line.\nOman Air’s Chief Executive Officer, Paul Gregorowitsch, was delighted with the win, saying:\n“This is a fantastic achievement for the Oman Air football team. On behalf of everyone at the airline, I would like to congratulate each and every team member. I would especially like to thank Harub, whose perfect timing and safe pair of hands have ensured that he was named Best Goalkeeper in the tournament.\n“The Oman Air football team’s success in Croatia was particularly impressive, as this was the first year they had entered the Aviation Football Cup. However, their accomplishments go beyond the sporting arena and have helped to raise awareness of Oman Air around the world. We look forward to seeing the side defend its title in Rome next year and take many more titles in the future.”\nThe Aviation Football Cup provides a platform for aviation professionals from all over the world to meet several times a year in order to travel, play and celebrate with their colleagues. The first tournament was initiated by airline employees and held in Portugal in 2005.\nIn the ten years since the Aviation Football Cup was launched, over 1,000 players from more than 100 teams, representing 42 countries, have participated in the tournament. Team rankings based on performance since 2011 place the Oman Air football team in 15th position, out of 125 sides, despite only having played in the 2015 tournament.\nAfter congratulating the team in person, Paul Gregorowitsch concluded:\n“Many of those participating in the tournament had not heard about the Sultanate of Oman, until the Oman Air team flew in and won the cup. Thanks to their hard work they have delivered success as promised and have brought a hard-won and prestigious award home.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:28:27.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
