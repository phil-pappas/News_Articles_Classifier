There is a sense of grieving. This time it was perhaps not as personal, because Courtney wasn’t playing. Last week we really felt it hard because Courtney was there on the pitch at the beginning of the match – even though he didn’t finish the game. I still feel close to the boys and feel very protective of that rugby family. Our general conversations with Courtney right now are about balance and learning from the experience he’s been through. We’ve all had disappointments, whether it’s been at work or socially or in our family life. It’s just about pulling yourself back up and getting on with it. I think that Courtney is quite resilient in that way and knows he’s got a job to do and the ability to do it. I’m sure he will move on and do well in the future. It’s just nice to remind them that they will come back and that their family is most important On Saturday we saw Joe Launchbury, Dan Cole and a couple of the others who we see regularly. This is a time when family becomes really important. It’s about putting it all into perspective and being able to get over the loss and the disappointment of it all. They’ve still got another game next week and they’re going to have to dig deep into their own courage and loyalty to Stuart Lancaster and each other, and go out and make the country proud of them. You can’t afford to be down for too long, and I think that whether they’re at club level or with England they will have had disappointments and they’ll have got over it. They have to. It’s just nice to remind them that they will come back and that their family is most important. Too early Perhaps in a lot of ways Rugby World Cup 2015 was probably a year or two early for this group of players to win. This World Cup seems wide open. You’ve got the likes of Japan beating South Africa and different results you’d never have dreamed of. But that won’t be consolation to the players at this moment: they do take it really personally. They live for each other, for the fans, for the family and for the boss. Courtney has experienced this before – at Northampton Saints. They were defeated by Leinster in the final of the European Championship, having dominated the first half 22­6, only for Leinster to have a purple patch in the second half and win 33-22. That Leinster game was so particularly cruel, almost like the Wales game, where it was literally a game of two halves. They’re going to have to dig deep into their own courage and make the country proud of them After the final game for England in this World Cup, they’ll sit down and review it all and will see how far Stuart has come with the lads. And they’ll see what could be improved and move on from there. Hopefully they’ll come to a sensible conclusion about it all and see that we can get better. We can move on. We’ve got the talent in this country. We may not have always had the players we really needed this time – they may have been unavailable through injury – but that’s the nature of the game as well. We’re not going to the Manchester match against Uruguay. [Courtney’s partner] Jesse’s mum and dad live up that way, so they’re going. I should see Courtney hopefully on Tuesday. We’ll have a get-together. Then he’ll be going back to the Saints and getting his head around playing for them again. It’s sad for the country that it’s worked out this way. I think it’s been so good for rugby as a whole – to push the benefits of it – and I hope that’s what comes out of this World Cup. It may not have worked out for us as a country, but as a sport we can still carry it forward. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:49:27.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
