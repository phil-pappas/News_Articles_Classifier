From October 26 potential passengers with valid loyalty club memberships from other cruise lines, or hotel groups and tour operators, will be able to join the line's Voyagers Club loyalty scheme and automatically match their existing level of benefits. The Status Match programme (which does not apply to airline frequent flyer programmes), has already been introduced in the US, Italy, Germany and France. MSC Cruises executive director UK and Ireland Giles Hawke said the line is simply 'looking for people who are travellers'. \"It is a way of encouraging those who have not tried MSC Cruises to join us while retaining all the perks and privileges they are used to.” \"Say you’re a top-tier member with Hilton. You come to us with proof and we make you a top-tier member with our loyalty scheme despite the fact you’ve never cruised with us before,\" said Giles Hawke, \"You book, get the relevant discounts and benefits and still remain a top tier Hilton member. The tier level (Classic, Silver, Gold or Black) to which passengers are assigned will correspond with the level of benefits they are receiving from their existing scheme. Membership of the Voyagers Club guarantees a five percent discount on cruise prices, on-board privileges and access to a range of sailings affording additional discounts of up to 15 per cent. In July the cruise line re-vamped its points programme (previously called MSC Club), to the dismay of some top-tier (Black) members who forfeited perks including discounts of up to 20 per cent discount on future cruises. The cruise line says the revised points-earning system, which has no age limit and is based on the type of cruise booked – including pre-booked shore excursions and spa treatments – rather than the number of nights sailed, comes with more favourable benefits and on-board promotions. These include a \"Welcome Level\" that kicks in as soon as a booking is confirmed. Status Match application forms can be downloaded from the MSC Cruises website (msccruises.co.uk) or picked up from travel agents.
