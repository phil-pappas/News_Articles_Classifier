The investigation into the sharing economy mini cab sector which includes multinational, multi-billion dollar companies like Uber, will review if sharing economy providers should continue operating under lighter, less costly regulations than the rest of the sector.”\nShe added the consultation could have “repercussions” for the hospitality industry which has been championing the need for similar consultations. BHA said hotels, B&Bs and serviced apartments are facing challenges from more lightly-regulated businesses such as Airbnb.\nEarlier this week, the Institute of Directors, which represents thousands of business leaders in Britain, attacked TFL’s plans to curb many of Uber’s services, saying they would “embed economic inefficiency” in the capital’s transport regulations.\n“Imposing a minimum five-minute wait time will just mean passengers stand on the side of the road looking at their car, unable to get in - wasting time, clogging streets and costing money,” said Simon Walker, director general of the IOD. Outlawing companies from showing available cars on an app is a Luddite solution to a problem which doesn’t exist.\n“Their proposals for further restrictions to an already heavily-regulated industry are backwards and would damage London’s reputation as a city which celebrates innovation and embraces change,” he added.\nOver the past couple of years Uber has faced strong criticism from taxi drivers across Europe with protests being held in London, Amsterdam, Berlin and Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:45:34.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
