Featuring many of the event industry’s leading brands, organisers and agencies, topics range from Come to Data - 10 Steps to Data Happiness; Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality at events and A vision of an event in 2020 to Engaging an audience online and offline; Creatively using technology at events and the Internet of Things and Make Your Own Device. \nFollowing positive feedback from last year’s event, the keynote sessions will be delivered in an open-plan format on the show floor, creating an inviting atmosphere that encourages both conference and exhibition elements to integrate as one interactive and immersive space for attendees. Leonora Valvo from Insight XM will deliver the event’s opening session, with a creative look at big data entitled ‘Come to Data - 10 Steps to Data Happiness.’ Event marketing is the original social network, but it hasn’t embraced data as rapidly as other marketing disciplines resulting in a gap. Leonora will explore the gap and demonstrate how big data coupled with some really smart data science can help event marketers optimise the event experience. Other prominent speakers include Scott Hope from Immersa, Ru Barksfield from Gruve, Ade Allenby from Reed Exhibitions, Anthony Dunn from i2i Events, Nick Morgan from Big Cat Group, and Live Union’s Jez Paxman. Event Tech Live’s commercial director Adam Parry commented on the line-up announcement saying: “Event Tech Live 2014 was refreshingly different and a completely different concept to other events. We want to retain that but also take a step forward this year. The open-plan concept worked really well, as did the balance of individual speakers and panels. We want to blur the lines between exhibition areas and conference areas and hope that by doing so, we see each of those elements behaving as one opportunity for attendees to learn, research and interact.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:22:56.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
