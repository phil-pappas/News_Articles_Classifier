In addition, five Dominican hotels are offering reductions on hotel rooms ranging from 25 – 50 per cent off their regular rates. Hotel specials are available from the Anchorage Hotel, Citrus Creek Plantation, Fort Young Hotel, Pagua Bay House and The Champs. \nThis initiative is just one of the many collaborative efforts between Discover Dominica Authority and regional carrier, LIAT, to facilitate travel for promotional purposes. In July, LIAT carried Barbadian professional surfer Brian Talma’s to Dominica for Dive Fest activities from July 17 – 20, 2015. The airline also assisted with the travel arrangements and transportation of costumes for Miss Dominica 2015 to participate in the Miss Jaycees Queen Pageant held in Antigua on July 26, 2015 and the Miss Caribbean Culture Queen Show held in Nevis on August 6, 2015. \n“LIAT works closely with its main Shareholder Governments to facilitate their travel to key events around the region, to assist them in travel arrangements for visiting artists and to attract people to visit the island,” said a LIAT representative. Meanwhile Director of Tourism, Mr. Colin Piper sees this partnership as one that is mutually beneficial. According to Piper, “Air access is critical to facilitating travel of residents and visitors in and out of Dominica and LIAT has been willing to work with Dominica in this regard”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:37:52.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
