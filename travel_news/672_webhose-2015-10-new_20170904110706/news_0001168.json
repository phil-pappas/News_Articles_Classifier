It will also be the first edition to be organised with the support of a foreign chapter – Peat Society of Indonesia. \n\nThe theme of the congress, Peatlands in Harmony – Agriculture, Industry & Nature , will relate to an integrated global perspective for the responsible use of peatlands and the preservation of their unique dynamics and natural biodiversity. \n\nLulie Melling, congress general, told TTGmice e-Weekly : “The Congress will also provide for researchers, academics and practitioners an ideal platform to congregate, share information and discuss their scientific results and experiences with particular reference to peat and peatlands in the tropics.” \n\n“We are honoured to host this congress which will be in Asia for the first time. Previous congresses were always in Europe and America and the downside of this was the prohibitive costs, especially for Asians from developing nations. \n\n“This event is very important for Malaysians and Asians in general as it will allow more delegates from Asia to attend and benefit from scientific, industrial and governmental discussions. They do not have to spend a lot on travel. It’s an opportunity for the people in the Asia Pacific to attend an International Congress and be able to listen to talks by leading authorities in the field and also to be able to know more about temperate and boreal peat especially in relation to sustainability issues, all at reduced rates. \n\n“Previous congresses held in Europe and US were really too expensive for Malaysians and Indonesians and the numbers that went were small. This will be a good platform to present scientific papers. It also gives a chance for the participants a chance to have international network, exchange and sharing of ideas and have personal discussions with light-minded delegates from around the world. Finally, we hope to be able to build up greater awareness to the world on what is tropical peat and at the same time as a platform to build research collaboration.” \n\nThe event is expected to draw the largest number of Asian delegation, at least slightly more than half of the total delegation of 1,500.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:03:46.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
