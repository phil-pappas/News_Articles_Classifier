Fellow believers in the restorative powers of a weekend jaunt will find a wonderland of wineries, beaches, heritage towns, unique shops and foodie trails in shipwreck country.\nExplore Queenscliff and the scenic Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria. Source: Supplied\nTo fully embrace the ghostly atmosphere of Queenscliff’s gas lights, turreted Victorian mansions and charmingly preserved shops of heritage Hesse St, the Vue Grand Hotel (1881) is a grand old dame and great base. Its 19th-century grandeur casts a spell that’s absent from many criminally bland contemporary cocoons.\nThe five-course Bellarine tasting menu in the Grand Dining Room is a gateway to great local produce, such as octopus or succulent house-made sausage, matched with the region’s cool-climate stars, like Jack Rabbit’s crisp, citrusy sparkling Blanc de Blanc or a buttery 2012 chardonnay from the peninsula’s oldest vineyard, Soho Road.\nThe hotel’s best accommodation is the Turret Suite, with 180-degree views over Port Phillip Bay, at the top of a gothic novel-worthy wooden staircase. In addition to the hotel’s unabashedly throwback ambience, the Vue Grand has a cheekier side.\nThe Vue Street Bar has been converted from the old terrace, now serving local and imported craft beers instead of scones.\nJust across the street, retro cocktails are served in the wonderfully wacky Salt Lounge above the Salt Gallery, where 1970s nibbles echo the kitschy appeal of Don’s Party-era furniture, and syrupy ’60s vocals.\nNo journey to the Bellarine is complete without a visit to Oakdene. Source: Supplied\nDiscover the chardonnays and pinot noirs of a whole new wine region, from the biodynamic wines of family-run Banks Road to the region’s culinary star player, Oakdene Vineyard. At Oakdene’s Mr Grubb cafe, casual family diners tuck into blue swimmer crab cakes, pork-belly pizza and hearty shiraz-braised steak pies with local field mushrooms, a match for the cherry spice of Oakdene’s Blue Label Bellarine Range shiraz.\nSitting among the lush coastal farmland of Oakdene’s Bellarine setting, feasting on the rich, caramel sweetness of Fort Saint Antoine’s La Couronne cheese, is a decadent, sensory counterpoint to the region’s post-dessert delights. The Bellarine has plenty of sightseeing and shopping to round out the weekend, with eclectic roadside collectables, chic boutique surprises — and enough good drops and local marinated feta to sink a ship.\nQueenscliff at dawn.
