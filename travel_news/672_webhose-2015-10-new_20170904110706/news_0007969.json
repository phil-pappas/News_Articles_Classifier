(Virginia City Tourism Commission) By Jay Jones \nA new spirit will appear in tiny Virginia City, Nev., on Halloween, but this one has nothing to do with ghosts. \nCemetery Gin, an adults-only beverage, will be unveiled -- and, of course, imbibed -- during a haunting celebration the evening of Oct. 31 at historic Piper’s Opera House . \nThe gin is a new product; it’s distilled in nearby Fallon, Nev. But hooch has been the stuff of area legends for years. C Street, the main drag through Virginia City, looks much the same as it did in its mining heydays of the mid 19th century. (Virginia City Tourism Commission) \nThe tales date to the 1850s, when the Comstock Lode, a silver and gold deposit, was discovered in Virginia City. Suddenly, hardscrabble miners, who worked under difficult, dangerous conditions, became multimillionaires. This 1868 photograph by Timothy O’Sullivan shows the Gould and Curry Mill in Virginia City, where vast amounts of gold and silver were mined. (Library of Congress) \nFast forward about 150 years. The Virginia City Tourism Commission began selling T-shirts and souvenirs promoting the mythical “cemetery gin,” so named because of the frequent deaths of the early miners, an average of one a day. \nThose who survived the mines said the only safe way to drink the local water was to mix it with two parts gin. \nTo roll out this new gin, a vintage, horse-drawn hearse promoting the new spirit will roll through the streets of Carson City, the state capital, as part of the Nevada Day Parade . \nThe annual parade steps off at 10 a.m. Oct. 31, which is the day in 1864 that Nevada was admitted to the Union. The annual Halloween parade through Carson City, Nev., celebrates statehood, granted on Oct. 31, 1864. (Nevada Day Parade) \nCemetery Gin, which will be sold by various merchants in Virginia City, is made from locally grown pine nuts by Frey Ranch Distillery , a grain-to-glass operation in Fallon. Frey Ranch in Fallon, Nev. (Frey Ranch Distillery) \nIts tasting room is open noon to 4 p.m. Saturdays. Various distilled spirits as well as local wines can be sampled. \nInfo: (775) 847-7500. \nFollow us on Twitter at @latimestravel \nALSO:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:39:06.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
