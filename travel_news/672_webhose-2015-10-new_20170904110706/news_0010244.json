Comment By Kristy Albano and Matt PickeringTravel the East Posted Oct. 6, 2015 at 4:53 pm Updated Oct 7, 2015 at 6:00 AM CLICK ON THE ARROW ON THE PHOTO TO SEE MORE Last weekend we discovered why Acadia is rated America's best national park. It's 47,000 acres of spectacular scenery, stretched mainly across Mount Desert Island in Maine. Situated on Maine's coastline, Acadia National Park is nature's playground with sandy beaches, cliff walks, mountainous regions, greenery and wildlife of all different species. We camped with a group of friends at Blackwoods Campground for the weekend. Blackwoods is situated within Acadia Park. The grounds are very clean and the campsites are private and secluded from your neighboring campers. Blackwoods is also in a great location, being only a short drive into Bar Harbor, the main town on the island, and walking distance from a number of hikes and trails. Since we arrived later on Friday evening, we only really had one full day to discover the most of Acadia. So we hopped in the car Saturday morning to take the scenic 27-mile drive on Park Loop Road, stopping at all the Acadia landmarks along the way. Our first stop was Schooner Head Overlook.We did a quick cliff walk trail that entered into a wooded path. It is a beautiful location to take a seat on the rocky cliffs and gaze out into the beauty of the rocky Maine coastline. Along the Great Head Trail we also stopped at Thunder Hole, an inlet named after being able to see and hear the power of the thunderous waves crash against the rocks. Afterward, we hopped in the car and headed over to Jordan Pond, another stop the Park Loop Road. The scenic drive ends at the summit of Cadillac Mountain. Cadillac is just over 1,500ft elevation and the highest point along the North Atlantic seaboard, within 25 miles of the shoreline. Overall this drive was a fantastic and breathtaking way to see most of the beauty Acadia Park has to offer. Our next destination was Sand Beach, which turned out to be our favorite of the trip. We did the 1.4 mile Great Head Trail, which took us up granite steps, to the cliffs on the left side of the shoreline and around Great Head peninsula. The ocean looked as blue as the Caribbean waters and the foliage colors were starting to sprout amid the treelines. We grabbed a seat on the rocks to enjoy our lunch, good company and the picturesque views. It wouldn't be a trip to Maine without seeing a lighthouse. So to end our Acadia Park exploration, we drove to the southwest portion of Mount Desert Island to visit the Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse. This is a working lighthouse with residents. You can walk right up to the light house or also take the path on the left side of the parking lot to capture a better distance photo of the light house and waves crashing against the cliffs. This is an ideal location to capture a beautiful Maine sunset. It is impossible to explore all the best kept secrets of Acadia Park in a day. Not seeing everything, just give us a great excuse to make a trip again next year to Acadia and explore more! Make sure to add Acadia to your list as well!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:39.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
