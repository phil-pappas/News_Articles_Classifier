This comes after the island was hard hit by Tropical Storm Erika on August 27, 2015. At a recent press briefing, the Minister provided an update on the status of the island’s tourism industry. \nAir access to the destination has resumed with LIAT, Seaborne and WINAIR offering daily flights between Dominica, from Antigua, Barbados, San Juan, Puerto Rico, St. Maarten, St. Thomas and St. Croix. Flights operate from the main airport – Douglas Charles Airport and the smaller one Canefield Airport which is 15 minutes from the capital Roseau. Road access has been greatly improved with the installation of three Bailey bridges along the west coast. Most roads are passable and access to the main sites and attractions is fairly simple. \nPopular sites like the Trafalgar Falls have been made even more breathtaking by Mother Nature, as well as the Emerald Pool and Middleham Falls. Visitors can also enjoy our black sand beaches at Mero and Purple Turtle, or visit the Kalinago Barana Aute in the east for an authentic Kalinago (Carib Indian) experience. For the more adventurous nature lover, seven of the fourteen segments of the Waitukubuli National Trail - the Caribbean’s longest hiking trail, are open to hikers. Divers and snorkelers can continue to enjoy the picturesque dive sites along the north, west and south coasts; including the popular Champagne Reef with its underwater geothermal springs which produces the effect of swimming in a glass of champagne. \nMore than 80% of the island’s accommodation is open to welcome guests. Visitors can select a wide variety of accommodation including boutique hotels, intimate guest houses and quaint inns. Dominica’s Director of Tourism, Colin Piper notes, “We invite all potential guests to visit Dominica. Tourism is a leading growth sector for Dominica’s economy and your visit allows for a sustainable rebuilding and recovery process post Tropical Storm Erika. We are confident that you will have a transformational experience.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:37:53.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
