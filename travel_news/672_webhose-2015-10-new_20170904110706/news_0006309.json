Kenes is the first PCO to be fully supported by Marketo’s market-proven “automation systems that convert once faceless databases into virtual audiences with real people.” \nFor Kenes’ global marketing division, the immediate benefits of Marketo are such that Kenes clients will receive better, more targeted, more relevant marketing services that at the end of the day, will increase their event results. This translates into the creation of more efficient, more relevant marketing campaigns, with the ability to succinctly track email marketing activities, honing in on prospects and delegates’ individual needs and interests. This includes developing effective email marketing, landing pages, campaign management, lead generation, CRM integration, social marketing, and marketing analytics. Founded in 2007, Marketo (NASDAQ: MKTO) is the leader in digital marketing software and solutions, with a focus on digital, social and mobile technologies and how organizations and marketers need to interact with people. Called engagement marketing, Marketo’s vision is rooted in the idea that both the day-to-day jobs and the strategic role of marketing and sales professionals have been disrupted by repeated waves of change. Today, marketing departments are increasingly responsible for leading and shepherding their customer journeys, and as a result, have become more important to companies’ customer acquisition success, and ultimately, revenue growth. Kenes is the only global PCO to integrate Marketo’s Best Practices for Email Marketing. “We have been using Marketo since the start of 2015 for all of our digital marketing. Marketo has really moved us to the forefront of marketing technologies,” said Ori Lahav, Associate VP Marketing at Kenes. “In just over eight months, we have seen a 35 percent increase in the number of leads, as well as a 10 percent increase in click conversion rates. These numbers are amazing, considering we are still in the initial stages of implementation.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:22:56.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
