(Fotolia) Alexey Stiop - Fotolia \nThere are a huge range of colours in Prince Edward Island's forests. The mix of the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Northumberland Strait create a moderate climate on the Island, making for a long viewing season.

Fall is also mating season for elks, which put on a show by making loud distinctive calls known as bugling. (Fotolia) Robert Kelsey - Fotolia \nThe Fundy Coastal Drive is another great Maritime journey. Colours here are at their best at the beginning of October. Plus, you'll not only be able to snap photos of some spectacular foliage, but you'll be able to witness the highest tides in the world at the Bay of Fundy. (Fotolia) mmackillop - Fotolia \nAbout an hour from San Diego, Julian, Calif. is a great place for off-the-beaten-path foliage viewing. (Fotolia) Terrance Emerson - Fotolia \nThe Niagara Parkway is the route Winston Churchill called \"the prettiest Sunday afternoon drive in the world.\" Follow the Niagara River to the lovely Niagara-on-the-Lake, where you'll take in the fiery fall foliage and a fantastic glass of ice wine. Stop by Niagara Falls to see one of Canada's greatest natural wonders (BOB TYMCZYSZYN/Postmedia Network) \nIn Missouri , Highway 100 or Highway 94, which straddle the Missouri River, offer plenty of scenery but also take you through wine country. October is a big month for festivals in the area. Check foliage reports at Mdconline .

(Fotolia) Dave Allen - Fotolia \nNot only will you get to see an incredible number of fall colours, but you’ll get arguably one of the best views in the world from most vantage points in the Rockies . By late September the colours will have bloomed, and while the temperature will have dropped a bit, it will still be comfortable. (Fotolia) Rafa Irusta - Fotolia \nTravel down Highways 400 and 11 from Toronto to Muskoka to see fantastic fall colours. The prime foliage viewing area runs from Severn River to Georgian Bay. There are plenty of red, yellow and orange leaves to discover, especially if you park the car in favour of hiking through Algonquin Park. (Fotolia) Elenathewise - Fotolia \nGlacier National Park offers mild fall weather, uncrowded roads, colourful mountainsides and an occasional glimpse of mountain goats or bighorn sheep. (Fotolia) Destinyvp - Fotolia \nAt Shenandoah National Park you can drive Skyline in a day with stops along the way at scenic overlooks and loop trails through the woods. The two-kilometre Limberlost Trail (at milepost 43) is a magical walk through a dense forest of towering trees, perfect for a family outing. (Fotolia) sborisov - Fotolia \nWinding around Cape Breton’s northern shore, the Cabot Trail is internationally recognized as one of the world’s most scenic drives - especially in the fall. The trees along the drive are some of the most beautiful in North America. Late September and early October are usually the best times to go leaf watching.
