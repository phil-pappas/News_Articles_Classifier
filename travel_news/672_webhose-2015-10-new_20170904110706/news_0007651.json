Photographer's Note \nOld JUKI ... Juki Corporation is well known as a global leader in manufacturing of industrial sewing machines. But actually the first machine produced by JUKI it was household sewing machine. Juki started home sewing machine business in 1945. The first home machine was manufactured in 1947 and was marketed in Japan and other countries around the globe. In 1953 Juki began the sale of industrial sewing machines. With the development of electronic functions and motors, the path was paved for advances in labor saving devices providing increased productivity, as well as operator comfort and safety. All new solutions in machines tested with success in demanding industrial field were adopted by JUKI for household machines.
