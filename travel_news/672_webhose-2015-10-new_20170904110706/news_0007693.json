No casualties have been reported so far, according to the agency.\nThe storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 240 kph (150 mph) when it slammed into the eastern coast of Luzon, according to the U.S. military’s Joint Typhoon Warning Center, although the Philippines’ national weather agency measured the winds as being significantly weaker, at 185 kph. The typhoon has since lost some of its strength as it has moved over land.\nBut much of the concern about Koppu’s impact centers on the extreme amounts of rain it’s expected to unleash.\n“The big story out of this storm is definitely going to be the rainfall totals. Some areas are forecast to receive more than 1 meter (39 inches of rain) by the end of Wednesday.\nThe typhoon is predicted to dawdle across northern Luzon for several days because of a ridge of high pressure over China blocking its progress farther north. That gives it longer than usual to soak the region’s mountains and swell its rivers, threatening people who live downhill and downstream.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:14:36.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
