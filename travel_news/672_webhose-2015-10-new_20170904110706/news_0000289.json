Over 1,000 delegates from across the globe will be welcomed to the venue in 2016 as it hosts medical conferences for the International Mesothelioma Interest Group (iMiG) and the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics (ISCB). \nThe iMiG is adding Birmingham to its list of international cities, which have previously included Kyoto, Boston, Cape Town and Amsterdam, for its 13th international conference in May 2016. Aiming to stimulate, initiate intense discussions and establish collaborations, the event is expected to attract over 700 delegates, researchers, scientists, physicians, nurses, allied health professionals and advocates from all over the world. Prof. Dean Fennell and Dr. David Waller, iMig 2016 Co-Chairs from International Conference Services Ltd said: “This is an exciting time in Mesothelioma in the UK, so we’re particularly looking forward to next year’s event which will build on the success of preceding meetings in Boston in 2012 and Cape Town in 2014. The event will feature a highly interactive, stimulating and multi-disciplinary program including workshops, plenary sessions as well as oral abstract and poster sessions and extended networking opportunities to foster communications between delegates. “We’ve chosen the ICC as the venue for our next conference as not only is it exceptionally easy for delegates from across the globe to get to, but it’s located in heart of the city centre offering delegates a wealth of accommodation and leisure activities; and it offers flexible space to suit our agenda.” In August 2016, ISCB will be bringing over 500 biostatisticians, epidemiologists and other medical researchers to the venue for their 37th annual conference. Lucinda Billingham, Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Birmingham and member of the ISCB also cited the ICC’s location and ease of access into Birmingham as a key factor in choosing the venue for the 2016 International Congress. “Location is always a key consideration. We chose the ICC because it is a world class facility in an excellent central location, making it easily accessible for our delegates using all modes of transport. We are very excited to bring the conference to Birmingham and work with the experienced team at the ICC.” Catherine Newhall-Caiger, Business Development Director for the ICC said: “The ICC’s location in the heart of the UK offers unrivalled connectivity by road, rail and air, making it accessible for local, national and international delegates. Our fantastic city centre location provides an enhanced delegate experience, offering a wide choice of restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, shops and over 6,200 hotel bedrooms all within walking distance of the ICC. “We look forward to hosting these international conferences at our purpose built conference centre and we are confident that the organisers and attendees will have an enjoyable experience at the ICC and in Birmingham.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:47:53.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
