His assertion of the number of spirits roaming the halls of County Hall - in which the London Dungeons is the deepest part - just ramps up further the genuinely terrifying nature of the attraction's heart-stopping séances, running all this month.\nLawman, star of the UK's cult series Most Haunted and his own Famous and Frightened show, said: 'There is undoubtedly an abundance of spiritual activity in County Hall and we had a number of vivid experiences, some involving the spirits of children of whom I felt there were many in the building.\nThe master medium took a team on his invesitgation into the 100-year-old building - and needless to say they were scared witless. The exorcist brought them face-to-face with the undead during a nerve-shredding séance inside the London Dungeon\n'In one of the rooms somebody could hear children screaming and another member of the group felt a child hold their hand for the entire time.\n'This same child, a boy of six or seven, came through to us in our séance, along with a young girl. Their presence strongly affected one of the group who could feel a child sitting on their lap.\n'The children were poor, raggedly dressed and I'd place them in the early Victorian period. Although wretched they weren't unhappy and like most children that age, were curious to see what was going on.'\nThe session, which was a popular way of communicating with spirits in the Victorian times, involved sitting around a table, connecting pinky fingers while Lawman called on the ghosts to come forward\nOne woman, Gemma Mullin (centre), was left petrified when Ian (left) revealed that the cold feeling she was experiencing on her legs and midriff was in fact the ghost of an urchin child sitting on her lap\nThe séance room is situated immediately over a sub-basement corridor where a number of London Dungeon staff have reported spooky experiences of their own in the past.\nThe Dungeon is now extending an invite to the capital's bravest souls to take a seat at any of their special Halloween séances, being held in what has now been confirmed as the most haunted address in town.\nBack-from-the-dead Victorian medium Florence Cook is taking up residence for a chilling season connecting directly with the long departed in a paranormal investigation guaranteed to make even the most hardened disbelievers' hair stand on end.\nThe truly terrifying round-table rendezvous will see all hell break loose as the most celebrated medium of the era whisks guests back to the city's most haunted house.\nThe ghost-hunting investigation through County Hall also left Ian's guests paralysed with fear. Chilling drops in temperature, racing heartbeats, choking sensations and the feeling of being unable to move were all reported\nSeveral of the group even experienced the feeling of being in the presence of young children, with Lawman confirming a sighting of the spirit of Florence Cook and a mysterious long-bearded doctor\nThe Dungeon is now extending an invite to the capital's bravest souls to take a seat at any of their special Halloween séances\nSéance! is set in 1873 and based entirely on real events. Guests will find themselves transported to 50 Berkley Square as Miss Cook - famed as the medium who claimed to materialise the spirit of Katie King - prepares for her latest sitting.\nDare they enter the séance chamber and witness Cook's communion with her ghostly spirit guide?\nOr will the supernatural disturbances in the ante-room send them fleeing into the night?\nThat's for the creatures of the night to decide. But if last week's pre-launch paranormal investigation by Lawman is anything to go by, there's plenty coming back to life in the deepest, darkest reaches of central London's creepiest spot.\nTRAVEL FACTS Tickets for the séance must be booked in advance.
