A surge in F&B revenues helped offset the lower room revenues but failed to escalate profits for hoteliers, with GOPPAR falling 17.7 percent to $80.64. \nHotel demand in Jeddah continued to flourish, as hotels reported a 4.5 percent increase in RevPAR for the month of August, compared to the same period last year, HotStats showed. \nThe surge in room revenues was driven by a 6.3 percent rise in occupancy levels, offsetting a 3.3 percent drop in ARR to $286.66 for the period. \nThe spike in hotel guests had a trickle-down effect on other hotel services, as F&B revenues increased, allowing TRevPAR to grow 5.6 percent. Complemented by a reduction in payroll expenses, profitability was boosted by the steady increase in top line revenues with GOPPAR growing by 8.8 percent to $177.47.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:17:12.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
