This year for the first time ever, Cruise Critic designated specific awards for its new River Cruise Line category, with AmaWaterways receiving the following:\nBest River Cruise Line for Dining – “A member of the prestigious La Chaine des Rotisseurs, AmaWaterways is distinct in that – no matter what the meal, from casual breakfasts and sun deck grill parties to elaborate, multicourse dinners – quality is consistent,” highlighted Cruise Critic editors. Best River Cruise Line for Active Cruisers – Cruise Critic editors also stated, “AmaWaterways has always been at the forefront of offering higher-energy excursions; it was among the first to have bicycles onboard for passengers to use in port.”\n“The entire AmaWaterways team is honored to have received these accolades from Cruise Critic,”” said Kristin Karst, co-owner and executive vice president of AmaWaterways. “Our expert chefs are dedicated to only the best in cuisine, and we offer a variety of dining venues, including The Chef’s Table specialty restaurant. When it comes to excursions, we focus on innovating new ways to explore Europe, like our guided bike tours and hikes, and have flexible options like gentle, regular and active walkers.” The Cruise Critic Editors’ Picks Awards are chosen by Cruise Critic’s international team of editors, based on the lines and ships they feel best represent excellence in each of the designated categories.\n“Our editors live and breathe cruising, sailing year-round and covering every aspect of the industry – from new ships and programs to updated amenities and features,” explained Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic. “With so many wonderful cruise options available, it’s never an easy list to narrow down, but these awards truly represent the lines that our experts have recognized as the best of the best. This year we also highlight the top river cruise lines, reflecting the growth of this sector – in terms of both interest and options.”\nThe Cruise Critic Editors’ Pick Awards follow AmaWaterways’ receipt of three Travel Weekly Magellan Gold Awards in September 2015. Earlier this year, the company was also honored at Luxury Travel Advisors’ ULTRA Summit, receiving the Award of Excellence in the Best Luxury River Cruise category. The company also received Best Onboard Dining, Best Theme Cruise and Best New Ship (AmaSonata) Awards in the River Cruise category during this year’s TravelAge West WAVE Awards. The first-ever TravAlliance Travvy Awards presented AmaWaterways with Best River Cruise Line, Best River Cruise Ship (AmaSonata), and Most Innovative River Cruise Executive this year, celebrating President and Co-Owner Rudi Schreiner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:32:35.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
