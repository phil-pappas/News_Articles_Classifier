In 2007 the France prop Sylvain Marconnet broke a leg on the ski slopes and was ruled out of Six Nations and World Cup matches. And playing a game of cricket without permission caused Scotland full-back Hugo Southwell to incur the wrath of Frank Haddon, then the head coach. Professional contracts no longer permit activities that are risky but while limiting some of their fun, insurance policies do benefit rugby players in the long term. Phil Winstanley, rugby director at Premiership Rugby and a former Sale Sharks prop, was one of the driving forces behind the Joint Professional Players Insurance policy, which this season covers all 633 players in the top division. It provides “24/7, 365-days-a-year cover against a single and sudden incident, on or off the pitch” and offers improved terms for those with pre-existing conditions or degeneration. “Rather than face a lifetime exclusion over a consistent issue, a player could play a certain number of games, depending on his age, and effectively the slate is wiped clean,” Winstanley says. Lewis Moody, the former England flanker, took out an insurance policy during his playing career. “Then it was up to you to make sure you were insured,” he says. “If you’re unfortunate and have to retire prematurely you need some comfort.” Up and running For the amateur athlete who overdoes things, a good soak may revitalise aching muscles. But when medical expertise is needed speed is the name of the game. The Vitality GP app provides video consultations with a GP within 48 hours (excluding Saturdays). They can prescribe medication and even refer you to a consultant of your choice. For minor complaints VitalityHealth’s PriorityPhysio service offers immediate access to a qualified physio without you needing to see a GP. • For more information on health and lifestyle, visit vitality.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:41:35.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
