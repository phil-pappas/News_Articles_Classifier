According to a statement from Air France-KLM, those routes have incurred the greatest losses for Air France. \n\nAir France’s longhaul fleet will also be scaled back by 14 aircraft to a total of 93 by 2017, with deliveries of new Boeing 787s made in 2011 now cancelled. \n\n“This reduction in activity will result in estimated overstaffing of 2,900 people, comprising approximately 300 pilots, 900 cabin crew and 1,700 ground staff,” Air France-KLM said in a statement. \n\nAir France, with a current staff of 52,000, is not ruling out compulsory redundancies and are welcoming voluntary resignations at the moment. \n\nDuring the unveiling of the restructuring plans on Monday, Xavier Broseta, Air France-KLM’s human resources manager was almost lynched by striking workers, according to a report by AFP. His shirt was also ripped off as security guards assisted him over a fence to safety. \n\nAnother security guard was knocked unconscious by protesters and is being treated at a hospital. \n\nIn the statement released in reaction to the violence, Alexandre de Juniac, chairman and CEO of Air France-KLM, said: \"We regret that no agreement has been reached with the Air France flight crew unions. The turnaround of the company can only be fulfilled with the mobilisation of all its employees. \n\n“The Air France management remains available to reopen negotiations with its unions at any point. We reaffirm our determination to implement the adaptation measures vital to ensuring the long-term future of Air France and allow it to finance its growth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:31:03.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
