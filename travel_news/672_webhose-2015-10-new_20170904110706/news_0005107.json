Courtesy Photo\nHere’s a tale/tail with a storybook ending.\nAnd it’s all true.\nOn Friday, a sweet Boston terrier named Chloe found her way back to her owner, an Alta Loma man who thought he would never see her again.\nChloe had been stolen from Brian Hanna’s yard five years ago, and on Friday he got the surprise of his life.\nThe Animal Care Wellness Center in San Bernardino called Hanna to tell him that Chloe had been turned in to them. Because the dog had been microchipped years ago, the center was able to identify Hanna as Chloe’s owner.\nIt’s a story that ends well, Hanna said. “If only she could talk about where she’s been.”\nIf only she could tell of her adventures — maybe she joined the circus, or worked as a therapy dog.\nOh, the stories she could tell, but we’ll never know the adventures of Chloe.\nThe happy reunion is a testament to the value of microchips, said Hanna, who works for Scott Brothers Dairy.\nChloe had been the pride and joy of Claudette, Hanna’s late wife, who died three years ago.\n“It brought me joy to know the dog that meant so much to my late wife is back with me,” he said.\nClaudette was Chloe’s primary caretaker and was devastated when the dog was taken, according to Hanna.\n“She never got over it,” he said.\nHe received a call from the veterinary hospital Friday morning and couldn’t believe it.\nChloe was kind of overwhelmed by all the people in the office when he arrived, but she looked the same — well-fed — with just a little gray on her face.\n“It’s amazing. We don’t get a lot of reunions because so often the microchip information is not right anymore,” said Kristie Snyder, hospital director.\n“Sometimes the chips lead to a dead end,” she added, “but this time, the dog was brought in by one of our clients, who lives nearby.”\nSnyder added that the reunion was “super-heart-warming and teary.”\nWendy Day is the good Samaritan, the heroine of this story.\n“I thought I saw a dog before I went to work, but she disappeared into a yard,” Day said. “Then my husband saw the dog at the front door when he came home. It was kind of late, so we kept her overnight and she played with our dog in the backyard. In the morning, I called our vet, hoping she had a chip that could be scanned.”\nAdvertisement\nDay said she was glad she could help, and Hanna wants to give her a big shout-out.\nAlthough Chloe did not know her name anymore, she had the same demeanor and listened well. She was physically healthy.\nIf the image of a missing dog and owner reunion brings on some deja vu , it could be because of The Sun story on a disabled San Bernardino Army veteran who was recently reunited with his emotional-support dog Twix.\nChloe, who was 5 years old when she disappeared, is now 10 and playful.\nShe seemed happy to see her daddy again, and if she had a tail she would have wagged it.\nTo show his gratitude to the hospital, Hanna is paying for three $75 microchips for people who cannot afford them.\nAnd now for the fun part.\nHanna’s partner, Monique, also has a Boston terrier. Her dog is named Jack. He’s 9.\nChloe and Jack are having great fun together, Hanna reported.\n“He’s thrilled to have a playmate. He’s really pepped up — they are quite the buddy-buddies.”\nAs Hanna said, “Life is funny — you have to enjoy each and every day.”\nWhen I asked Hanna if he’s going to spoil Chloe, he said, “You should see my PetSmart bill.”\nAbout the Author Reach the author at Michel.Nolan@inlandnewspapers.com or follow Michel on Twitter: @MichelNolan .\nFull bio and more articles by Michel Nolan Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151020/NEWS/151029952/EP/1/1/EP-151029952.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://www.sbsun.com/veterans/20151012/disabled-san-bernardino-army-veteran-asks-for-help-finding-his-dog", "http://twitter.com/MichelNolan", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=123", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:59:18.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
