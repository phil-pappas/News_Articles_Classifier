While snowfall cannot be guaranteed, it is more likely. At the very least you can expect a Christmas-card setting with traditional handmade decorations, along with daytime and evening markets packed with festive flavours and, if you’re lucky, local choirs providing the requisite soundtrack. • Why I hate Christmas markets It is possible to cruise by river or sea to enjoy Europe’s markets. The advantage with river cruising is the opportunity to visit not just one but several Christmas markets and, as you sail, to see towns and villages decorated for the festive season. The biggest concentration of Christmas markets lies along the banks of the Rhine and the Danube ; there are also some on the Main and the Seine – many in Paris itself. There are still plenty of end-of-year cruises to choose from, but you’ll have to be quick. All the cruises listed here are full board and include return flight unless stated. The Rhine The highlights: the Rhine Gorge, lined with castles and charming toes-in-the-water towns and villages; imposing Cologne Cathedral; picturesque Strasbourg. Cruise this river, which weaves through the heart of Germany, and you’ll be able to enjoy German Christmas markets in Rudesheim, Koblenz and Cologne on a four-day trip with The River Cruise Line (0844 544 6437; rivercruiseline.co.uk ). Its cruises are on board the Lady Anne with departures on December 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 2015. From £269 per person including coach travel. Or, on board Serenity, take a four-day trip from Mainz, which includes Christmas markets in Mannheim, Heidelberg and Strasbourg – thought to be Europe’s oldest, dating from 1570. Departs on December 8 and 11 2015. From £399 per person (no single supplement) including coach or Eurostar travel. Cologne Cathedral Photo: GETTY Choose from seven themed Christmas markets in Cologne, and seven in Düsseldorf, or visit markets in Cologne, Bonn and Koblenz with Saga (0800 096 0079; travel.saga.co.uk ), which offers these three and four-night cruises on Regina Rheni II, departing on December 13 and 16 2015. The cruises cost from £269 or £499 per person including coach or Eurostar travel and breakfast (pay separately for dinners). Single cabins at no extra cost. • How to visit Father Christmas in Lapland Christmas markets in Strasbourg and Heidelberg also feature on a round-trip cruise from Cologne with Archers Holidays (0800 997 8719; archersdirect.co.uk ), which sells this four-night cruise on A-Rosa Viva, departing on December 3 2015.

With hot punch and chestnut stands, markets and classical concerts, Vienna comes into its own in December. The biggest market is held in front of the imposing City Hall, while the baroque Belvedere Palace makes an equally impressive backdrop for the 40-plus stalls called Christmas Village. It’s a little farther from the centre, but don’t miss the atmospheric, year-round Nachtmarkt for its amazing foodstuffs. A classical music concert is included on Uniworld’s River Princess (0800 988 5873; titantravel.co.uk ), which sails from Nuremberg to Vienna on December 15 2015 costing from £1,779 per person. If you’d like an exclusive tour of Frankfurt’s Thurn und Taxis Palace, with a visit to its private Bavarian Christmas Market, Tauck includes both on its eight-day cruise from Nuremberg to Vienna on its ship Savor, departing on December 12 2015 (from £1,620 per person, excluding flights).
