We felt it should have been faster than it was. But we'll fix it.\"\nSunday's Hollywood Casino 400 is the fifth of 10 playoff races, and Truex is among 12 drivers in the hunt for the championship. He is third in the standings, seven points behind leader Joey Logano and one behind Kevin Harvick.\nThe Chase began with 16 drivers and it will shrink to eight after next week's race at Talladega, Ala. Logano — who won last week at Charlotte, N.C., to begin the second playoff stint — is the only driver to secure an Elite Eight berth, by virtue of that win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:08:47.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
