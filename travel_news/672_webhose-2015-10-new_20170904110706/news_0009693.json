The Y's goals of raising awareness about facility water usage and overall savings of water was met with great success. In just seven months the Y has saved over 1.1 million gallons of water compared to last year.\nThe Y implemented physical facility changes as well as increased social awareness. Small changes included the installation of water restrictors on every showerhead and faucet. In addition, members pledged for one month to take a 5 minute shower or less, and to bring in their own towel each time they visited the facility. New behaviors began to emerge and new habits formed â€“ individuals would turn off the shower water while lathering up, and turn it back on to rinse off as well as limiting their towel usage and bringing their own towel from home.\nThe Y posted its monthly usage in each locker room, and members could connect how their behavior had a direct impact in the overall decrease in water usage. The year started with the facility using 31,300 gallons per day, and by August the daily usage reduced to 19,800 - this is a 37% reduction. The Y hasn't reached this low since well before 2010, and membership is significantly higher now.\nThe Y, a socially responsible organization, is proud of its community for joining together to make a positive environmental impact.\n releases/downtown-berkeley-ymca-conserves-water-300157525.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/downtown-berkeley-ymca-conserves-water-300157525.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC25185&Transmission_Id=201510091934PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC25185&DateId=20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:41:47.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
