This 'improves circulation and tones the body'\nWhen guests arrive, first, they are seen by a nutritionist, who weighs them, calculates their BMI, body fat percentage and takes waist, abdomen and hip measurements.\nNext, they are seen by a doctor who conducts a range of medical test, including looking at their blood sugar levels, triglycerides (fat levels in the blood) hormone levels and urine.\nDepending on the experts' orders, they are then put on a strict 1,300 calorie or, if on the brink of a heart attack, a 900 calorie menu which has been designed by two-Michelin-star chef Andoni Luis Aduriz of Mugaritz restaurant.\n 2 Next Why British Airways' new £3k-a-ticket first-class cabin is...

Some people are assigned food supplements; 'fat-burning' Levanat Plus – and a diuretic called Drenanat.\nThey are also given a FitBit for the week and encouraged to do 10,000 steps a day.\nThere are no heavy weights classes here, the exercise is gentle; walks on the beach, swimming and Pilates in the spa's spacious gym.\nIn seven days, most men lose 3.5kg (7lbs) and women lose 2.5kg (5lbs).\nPictured is the spa's luxury pool\nPictured is the luxury spa, where guests can spend hours watching the jacuzzi change from blue to purple to red under a 'swan head' jet that massages the back\nThe rooms come complete with their own jacuzzi baths, crisp and comfortable robes and bamboo flip flops\nHead chef head chef Tim Van Buchem, creates 14 different menus a week, which all include a starter, a fish course, a main course, dessert and carbs on Wednesdays and Sundays.\nThey contain mainly ingredients from a local allotment, locally reared meat and absolutely no salt or additives.\nBreakfast consist of a piece of crunchy toast, less than the size of a child's palm, a spoonful of tomato salsa and three slices of flavourless ham.\nLow calorie fibre-rich biscuits called Fibroki - supposedly to keep you full until lunch - are also served with some sugarless grape jam.\nTo drink, medicinal-tasting weight loss teas, a thimble of orange or watermelon juice and coffee.\nThe four-course lunch and dinners were exceptional and became the highlight of every day.\nStarters included mussels with sea foam on a bed of pickled cucumber; asparagus, truffle and feta salad and feta gnocchi with tomato.\nFor the main meal, a rack of lamb in a sweet-curry sauce; monkfish with chicken-flavoured mushrooms or tuna steak in almond milk.\nGuests are fed a 1,300 calorie or 900 calorie menu which has been designed by two-Michelin-star chef Andoni Luis Aduriz. It involves mussels on a bed of pickled cucumber (right) and yoghurt mousse (left)\nPictured are mussels on a bed of courgetti spaghetti (left) and a zingy sugar-free raspberry macaroon (right)\nEvery day, guests carry out a spa circuit and a Pilates class in order to distract themselves from the hunger\nPictured is the salt sauna, which glows red. The walls are made from blocks of salt, and sitting in the room supposedly benefits people with respiratory problems\nAnd dessert - no doubt a difficult meal for a chef not able to use sugar - pineapple with yoghurt mousse; a baked apple; and a zingy raspberry macaroon.\nHaving transitioned from my normal diet of 2,000 plus calories a day, making the change - even for just two days - was difficult and I thought about food constantly.\nI began drinking water profusely to stave off hunger, and trying to force myself to chew each mouthful as slowly as possible.\nAnd, although I was most definitely hungry, it wasn't unbearable.\nI could distract myself by reading a book on an apple-shaped sofa, sunbathing or going for a swim.\nAs part of the weight loss plan, guests were offered special diuretic cocktails - most had maximum 30 calories - which are available all day.\nAccording to the spa, diuretic cocktails help prevent the water retention associated with obesity.\nThis occurs because being overweight affects the lymphatic system, meaning fluid is not drained properly, so it causes the body to swell.\nThe cocktails contained ingredients that make the body excrete more water, to prevent this water retention.\nSome were delicious; one tasted like a virgin mojito. Others tasted like watered down cough syrup.\nTo distract from the hunger, each day guests are also offered a spa treatment, including a hot stone massage, and an one organised exercise activity.\nGuests are also fed diuretic cocktails which all contain a maximum of 30 cocktails. Some tasted like virgin mojitos, some were medicinal-tasting\nGuests are given a FitBit at the beginning of the week and told to do 10,000 steps a day. Pictured are the cross trainers in the bright and airy gym\nThey are also free to relax in the gorgeous spa, where the whirlpool jets were pleasingly strong and the towels crisp and white.\nHours could be whiled away watching the jacuzzi change from blue to purple under a 'swan head' jet that massages the back.\nWe were told to do a daily 'spa circuit’ which meant sitting for five minutes in the each of the hot and cold plunge pools, the sauna, the steam room and the ice cave complete with snow.\nThe ice cave in particular which was strangely refreshing and allegedly burned calories.\nFor those bored of regular saunas, the spa also one whose walls are made from blocks of salt (supposedly good for breathing) which glowed an inviting red.\nBreathing in the salt, the spa claims, is good for those with respiratory problems.\nAfter a two day stay, I had lost 1.8kg (almost 4lbs) bringing my BMI down to 19 - with which I was thrilled.\nFor those that can afford it, or for those who desperately need to slim down, Healthhouse Las Dunas is perhaps the chicest way to do it.\nTRAVEL FACTS HealthHouse Las Dunas is 40 minutes from Malaga airport by taxi.\nMonarch operates flights to Malaga from Birmingham, London Gatwick, London Luton and Manchester airports with fares, including taxes, starting from £32 one way (£59 return).\nA 7-day weight loss programme costs €2,400 (£1,780) per person including accommodation, assessment by doctors, nutritionists and psychologists, all meals and snacks, spa access, spa treatments and exercise activities.\nRead more: healthdunas Cheap Flights & Holidays - Book Your Flight Online - Monarch", "external_links": ["http://www.healthouse-naturhouse.com/en/tratamientos?article_id=4", "http://www.monarch.co.uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1GfOj0I"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:38:21.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
