He bought Hawkeye a camera and was instantly filled with joy at seeing his son's perspective. \"At the age of four, I think Hawkeye was open to just about anything. We also shoot bow and arrows, play with Legos, and draw,\" Huey told Business Insider. \"We were just a father and son going on our first big trip away from Mom.\" Now five years old, Hawkeye has more than 139,000 followers on an Instagram account run by his father. Like Huey, Hawkeye is now represented by National Geographic. The two are currently raising money via Kickstarter to fund Hawkeyeâ€™s first book of published work . Their initial goal was $35,000, but they've already raised more than $37,000 with just one day left to go. Visit Business Insider to see more of Hawkeye's work.
