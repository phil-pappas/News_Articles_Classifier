Shared facilities include a sheltered outdoor swimming pool, gym, games room, tennis court and vegetable garden. Location: 10/10 Accessed via gravel farm tracks, and set under old beech trees, these three houses are spread over an historic 250-acre farmstead on the western edge of Dartmoor National Park, near the village of Brentor. The Coach House is closest at Burnville Farm to the shared outdoor pool The views are bucolic: green fields dotted with sheep and russet-coloured South Devon cows, native woodlands, thatched cottages, open moorland and, on the horizon, the tiny hilltop parish church of Brentor. Lydford Gorge and the Granite Way, one of Devon’s most popular family cycle tracks, are nearby. Style/character: 7/10 With lichen-splattered granite walls, flagstone floors, wood beams and log-piled fireplaces, the two largest properties - the Coach House and the Farmhouse - have plenty of rustic appeal. Low ceilings and a huge inglenook fireplace give the Farmhouse the most character, while the Coach House has superior facilities. The Red Barn, a smaller converted barn, is the brightest of the three, with huge windows and moorland views. The Coach House has rustic appeal The décor throughout is dated, with garish curtains and walls painted in old-fashioned colours, but the kitchens are modern and well-equipped, with big family fridges. Facilities: 9/10 All three properties have private gardens and shared use of a sheltered, nine-metre outdoor swimming pool, a gym and tennis court. There’s a games room with a skittle alley, pool table and table tennis, and a beautiful walled vegetable garden where guests can pick fresh produce. Young visitors are invited to collect eggs from the farm in the morning and, in lambing season, help bottle-feed lambs and help with births. The five-bedroom Coach House is best-equipped for big families: the dining room seats 12, there’s a toddlers’ playroom, a piano, sand pit, outdoor playhouse, flat lawn for football and badminton, plus a five-metre “wave” swimming pool, a sauna and children’s snug with a log-burning stove (grille provided). The four-bedroom Farmhouse has a small, but light-filled conservatory in the former dairy. The Red Barn, which sleeps six, has its own indoor pool. All three houses are run on an environmentally-friendly wood-pellet biomass system. Value for money: 9/10 Prices for the Coach House (five bedrooms) start from £883 per week in low season; rising to £1334 in high. Free Wi-Fi. Eating Owner Victoria Cunningham, who runs a bed and breakfast from the main farmhouse, can serve an extensive dinner menu using vegetables from the garden and meat from the farm, when available. The nearby Dartmoor Inn at Lydford has one of the best reputations in the county for its fresh, locally sourced menu.
