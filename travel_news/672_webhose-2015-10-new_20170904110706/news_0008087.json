But the older we get, the more likely we are to be unwell. The correct insurance can help take away worries over how you would cope were you taken ill. You can get private medical insurance, critical illness cover and travel insurance policies: useful if you fall sick while overseas. And age isn’t a bar: you can sometimes take out policies in your seventies or eighties. But the older you are, the higher your health insurance premiums will be. According to the Association of British Insurers , a 70 year-old will pay around three times as much for private medical insurance as a 35 year-old. So why have medical insurance when we have the NHS? Here’s a reason: a recent report from the Patients Association found the typical waiting time for a hip replacement in England last year was 103 days, up from 87.5 days in 2010. Critical-illness cover pays a lump sum if you’re diagnosed with a serious condition If you have private treatment, you can avoid long waits. And the typical cost of a hip-replacement operation in a private hospital is about £10,000: health insurance could pick up most of that cost. Of course, there’s no NHS abroad, which makes taking holiday insurance vital, particularly if you’re travelling long haul. You can shop around (using comparison websites) for the best deal. There are also specialist insurers for older holidaymakers. If you have a pre-existing medical condition, declare it or a claim could be refused. There are special travel insurance policies for those with medical conditions, so there’s no excuse not to take cover – although it may be pricey. Critical-illness cover pays a lump sum if you’re diagnosed with a serious condition such as cancer. Often it’s sold as an add-on to life cover. You might be able to take out a policy up to 70 – but it may be expensive. Age isn’t the only factor: if you smoke, premiums will be higher, and if you have existing medical conditions, you must disclose them.
