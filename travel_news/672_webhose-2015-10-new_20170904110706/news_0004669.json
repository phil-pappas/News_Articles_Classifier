Like Clare Tanguy Brown, I too had walked up to the crater of Mount Vesuvius with a coachload of tourists, all of us in unsuitable footwear, and marvelled at the enormity of it. Enjoying a drink at the café at the top, I wondered at the incongruity of a tourist attraction on the site of past, and probable future, destruction. My visit in 1983 was poignant as it was almost 40 years since my father, stationed in Italy with the Royal Fusiliers, had been recovering from an appendectomy in a hospital bed in Naples on that day in 1944 when Vesuvius last erupted. He wondered whether he was delirious as day appeared to turn to night, and nurses, wearing tin helmets against falling debris, explained that it was not enemy fire but a volcanic eruption. Fifty years later, when he could no longer remember what day it was, Dad described this scene with clarity to my husband, who now shares the story with our children. Jill Barr wins a £250 railbookers voucher More feedback from readers Get streetwise Regarding your “Insiders’ China” special (October 17), it is safer to walk through the streets of China than Barcelona, Rome or Marseille – even for foreign teenagers. I’d sooner allow my daughter to travel there than in Thailand or India. It’s also very cheap. If you want to stay in a five-star, Western-managed hotel for less than £90, China is the place. The exchange rate is good, so why not? Comment posted online • China: a travel guide China can be tackled alone, says our guide for solo travellers Photo: Getty Gill Charlton’s suggestion to get your destination written in Chinese characters (“ Go it alone and blend in with the locals ”) is sound advice. Arriving in Yunnan, we couldn’t understand the road signs, let alone find our guesthouse. Luckily we met an Italian who spoke, but couldn’t write, Chinese. He asked a security guard to write down the address. The script looked like a work of art. With this, and plenty of sign language, we found our accommodation. Don’t be surprised if the paperwork required for foreigners is just too much hassle for some hotels and you are turned away. For the most part, though, we were given a warm welcome. Many Chinese wanted to practise their English, and we were showered with attention and even gifts at several guesthouses, as their “first Western guests”. Anne Muston Van Gogh parade What a pity the article “ Gaze on Van Gogh at his most glorious ” (October 17) did not appear in The Telegraph earlier in the season. Devoted Van Gogh fans would then have had the chance to visit his house in Zundert and enjoy the wonderful Corso Zundert at the same time. This year’s parade of 19 floats took place on September 6-7 and was dedicated to the life of Van Gogh and his paintings. It was an amazing spectacle – floats 150ft long and 30ft high, each decorated with more than 400,000 dahlias and accompanied by marching bands. A spectacular bouquet of enormous red poppies opened out as the float moved along, each one becoming a butterfly. The annual Corso Zundert parade Photo: Alamy A lifelike head of Van Gogh intertwined with the head of his brother Theo disintegrated into broken shards to represent their fractured relationship, then came together again – brotherly love reunited. The Corso is held every year, usually without a theme – but this year’s was a Van Gogh celebration. Davena Lawrence Witch hunts It is disturbing to be reminded of the brutality of the witch hunts which took place so long ago up and down the land. Nevertheless, Susannah Lipscomb’s article (“ On the trail of sorcery and superstition ”, October 18) was a real eye-opener for me. I am from Essex and I am married to a Lancastrian from Pendle. It seems that both areas have a dark history surrounding their treatment of “witches”. However, the two regions have very different approaches to these connections today. In Pendle, you cannot fail to notice the witchcraft and sorcery theme. Witches feature heavily: painted on the buses, carved into wooden signs and depicted on beer pumps, as well as being the star attraction of the various “witch routes” that criss-cross the (wonderful) landscape. Compare this with Essex – where I grew up – where there is not a trace of witchery. I had no idea of the gruesome past of local landmarks such as Colchester Castle until I read your article. So thank you to the author for the informative writing. It’s always good to learn something new.
