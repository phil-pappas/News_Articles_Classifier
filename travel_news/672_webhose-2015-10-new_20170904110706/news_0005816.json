Very, very falch in fact.\nFor non-Welsh speakers (and I had to Google it) falch is Welsh for “pleased”. And boy am I falch to be at the Golden Lion Inn in Newport, Pembrokeshire, after a long drive with husband Tony for our weekend break.\nOur check-in was seamless, delayed only by stopping to take in the wonderful aroma coming from the kitchen. Then we entered our bedroom and gasped.\nThe website pictures didn’t do it justice – it was en suite and enormous with plenty of room to really relax.\nBut the unpacking had to wait because we wanted to get back downstairs to check out that food.\nAnd it was awesome, with superb service – especially our sharing platter of Italian meats, cheeses, hummus, olives, capers and bread . Total heaven and just what we needed.\nUp early and following a fine ­breakfast the next day, we set off to explore the area.\nOur first stop was the medieval abbey ruins in the pretty village of St Dogmaels, a lovely location with a cafe and museum ( stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk , free).\nStone age: Joanna at Pentre Ifan\nThis is a great place if you like walking because the 186-mile Pembrokeshire Coast Path starts here (or finishes, depending on which way you’re going!)\nHelpfully, the Poppit Rocket No.405 coastal bus ( pembrokeshire.gov.uk ) links St Dogmaels with Cardigan, Poppit Sands and Newport. There’s a morning service to drop off walkers at a start point and an afternoon one to pick them up again.\nPoppit Sands itself is stunning, with dunes and a wide sandy beach, but it was time for us to move on to Cilgerran Castle . This is an absolute must-see, and will get your heart pumping with its steep steps to the top. But it’s worth it for the spectacular views.\nTo conclude our day’s discoveries, we stopped at a Neolithic burial site called Pentre Ifan in Nevern. Its setting is tranquil, picturesque and with an eerie silence ( cadw.gov.wales free).\nAfter such an amazing day we needed refuelling, and luckily it was just a few steps from the Golden Lion to Cnapan, a lovely restaurant with rooms ( cnapan.co.uk ).\nPlacid: The Newport coast\nThe food is exquisite and the service can’t be faulted. I had prawns and Welsh sea trout on a bed of samphire, a sea grass. A taste sensation!\nThe next morning, after another incredibly peaceful sleep (it must have been all the amazing fresh air and fabulous weather), we went time- ­travelling again.\nThe destination was Castell Henllys, an impressively recreated Iron Age village in Meline. You need sturdy shoes for the two-hour walking tour, which ends at a welcoming coffee shop ( castellhenllys.com £5).\nOur next visit made me “falch” I’d filled up with coffee. Bro Meigan Gardens is a delightful but large site with a wild meadow, flowers, trees and springs ( bromeigan.co.uk £5).\nOur last stop was at the 12th century cathedral in St Davids ( stdavidscathedral.org.uk free), where I ended up buying some Welsh slate for the garden back at home.\nAfter two days of rambling coastal paths, climbing steep castle steps, strolling in beautiful gardens, eating fine food and breathing pure, ­Pembrokeshire air, “falch” perfectly summed up how we both felt.\nGet there Rooms at the Golden Lion, Newport, Pembrokeshire, start at £90pn B&B. 01239 820321 goldenlionpembrokeshire.co.uk\nNewport is on the A487; Fishguard railway station is about 9 miles.\nTourist info: visitpembrokeshire.com\nBest time to go: Pembrokeshire’s pleasing this autumn\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.stdavidscathedral.org.uk/", "http://www.cnapan.co.uk/", "http://stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://bromeigan.co.uk/", "http://www.pembrokeshirecoast.org.uk/default.asp?PID=261", "http://www.pembrokeshire.gov.uk/", "http://cadw.gov.wales/splash?orig=%2F", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cilgerran-castle/", "http://www.visitpembrokeshire.com/", "http://www.goldenlionpembrokeshire.co.uk/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-10-24T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:27:47.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
