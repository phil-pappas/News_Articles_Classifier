(Milos Bicanski / Getty Images) Larry Habegger, Dani Burlison Chicago Tribune \nGreece: Tourists soon will be chipping in to help pay off more than $380 billion in debt by paying nearly double or more for entry to many popular tourist sites such as the Acropolis and the country's 200 state museums. Some reports indicated that entry fees may increase to four times the current rate at some locations. The fee hikes will take place starting April to November 2016, with a 50 percent discount offered for the rest of the year. \nAustralia: Bush-fire season runs October through May of each year, with blazes racing through large areas of land and destroying property, according to officials. Tourists visiting the country, especially nature preserves and other wilderness regions, should be especially cautious of high levels of fire danger, heed warnings from tour companies and authorities, follow local media for information about fire conditions and familiarize themselves with emergency procedures. \nBarbados: The U.S. Embassy is warning tourists of an increased, ongoing risk of criminal activity, particularly in the Pine East West Boulevard and Pine North South Boulevard areas. Criminals wait for potential victims at stoplights and stop signs and rush to steal valuables from vehicles, authorities said. Tourists are urged to conceal valuables and to keep vehicle doors locked at all times while in the area. \nMaldives: Outbreaks of a highly contagious viral fever, the common cold and diarrhea have been reported, and tourists are urged to take preventive action against contracting and spreading the infections. Precautions include washing hands, avoiding crowded events, increasing fluid intake and consuming only purified water. Anyone with a fever lasting more than three days should seek medical attention. \nTanzania: Security forcers were preparing for potential clashes on Election Day, Oct. 25, between the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi party and its rivals, the Chadema and CUF parties. Authorities are prepared for possible security risks during the record turnout for this year's elections, particularly in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. Tourists should avoid large crowds and have personal security plans in place. \nCompiled from news services and travel sources.
