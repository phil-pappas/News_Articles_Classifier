But the root of the problem is lack of funding needed to address the congestion challenge that contributes to these delays,” said Boardman. “Persistent underinvestment leads to congestion – and the lack of investment threatens our national economy.”\nNowhere are infrastructure problems worse than in the New York and Chicago regions.\nAs the majority owner of the Northeast Corridor (NEC), a complex commuter and intercity rail network, Amtrak depends on the infrastructure investments made today to help ensure it can deliver mobility, reliability and safety to its stakeholders in the future. Each day, 750,000 people board trains headed to work, school and other destinations making the NEC one of the largest economic drivers of our American economy.\nAmtrak has completed construction on Phase I of the Hudson Yards Concrete Casing, begun construction on Phase II, and continues early planning work on the Hudson Tunnel Project. But future work on other critical components of the Gateway Program – including two new Portal Bridges and an expanded Penn Station – remain unfunded.\n“We don’t need to find a solution – we need to fund one,” Boardman stated.\nIn addition to New York, Chicago is the nation’s largest rail hub, with every major railroad operating through the area. The Blue Ribbon Panel was formed to make recommendations to address the Chicago rail gridlock that is causing major delays for passengers and for freight shipments. Chicago congestion problem creates an economic vulnerability of up to $799 billion every year, impacting six key industries constituting 85 percent of U.S. domestic product.\nThe panel recommended bringing together rail traffic control dispatchers separated by thousands of miles, improved operating practices by Amtrak and other railroads and funding for priority projects already identified in Northern Illinois and Indiana as top recommendations.\nSource: Amtrak", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:37:48.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
