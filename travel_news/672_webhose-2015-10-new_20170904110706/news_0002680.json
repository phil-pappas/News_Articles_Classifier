The levy for longhaul first/business class passengers is HK$180. Meanwhile, the fee for shorthaul transit passengers in economy class will be set at HK$70. \n\nThis arrangement is scheduled to be implemented from the 2H2016 till 2031. AAHK estimates about 70 per cent of departing passengers will pay a fee of HK$90 or below. \n\nLester Hui, assistant general manager at Kwan Kin Travel Services, played down the impact on outbound travel: “Hong Kongers won’t fly less because this is a normal charge. However, we agencies have been collecting fees for airports without charging any commission and this is not fair. \n\n\"Moreover, there is also a risk for wholesale ticketing agents to bear the fee if retail agencies suddenly close down. It will be ideal if we are offered a service fee, around five to seven per cent of the cost, which is similar to airline commissions.” \n\nSandy Chan, general manager at Vacation Asia Hong Kong, reckons the government should foot the bill rather than shift the burden to visitors. “The airport makes money and this charge not only dampens the city’s image but also provides another excuse for visitors to reject Hong Kong as a destination,\" she said. \n\n“Business has been tough and the new charge would further increase staff workload because agencies would collect the fee for airports and our staff need to explain the charges to clients.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:25:16.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
