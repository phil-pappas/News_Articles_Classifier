The event is being generously hosted by the Provincial Government of Albay in partnership with The Department of Tourism, Philippines. \nSecretary Jimenez, who is responsible for the country’s highly successful tourism campaign, It’s More Fun in the Philippines, will speak on the “Successful Destination Marketing Campaign – Trend in this digital economy”. \n“This forum is timely and relevant as we step up our marketing efforts for our destination-based campaign and as we launch Visit the Philippines Again (VPA) 2016 –which is going to be the most massive retail-focused effort the Philippines has ever made. Destination marketing is a daunting task as it involves selling an experience, both tangible and intangible. The Philippines prides itself of having a unique biodiversity, rich natural resources, and wide variety of product offerings for tourists. But most of all, we have the Filipino people—the country’s most important asset—to thank for, who serve as the PDOT’s partners in building our brand and fulfilling the promise of a more fun Philippines,” Tourism Secretary Jimenez said. \nMr Mario Hardy, CEO, PATA, said, “We are extremely delighted to have Secretary Jimenez open the event, as his experience and expertise on how to market a destination is something all industry stakeholders should learn from, especially when trying to market a new emerging destination. In addition to Secretary Jimenez, we have a very broad and dynamic range of speakers confirmed for the event, and delegates can be assured of coming away with practical skills and knowledge to take back and apply to their organisation, especially through the Technical Tour and Tourism Marketing Treasure Hunt.” \nPATA is also delighted to announce that Mr Joey Sarte Salceda, Governor, Provincial Government of Albay, Philippines, will be providing the closing address on “Ecotourism – Transcending Climate Change”, the theme of this year’s PATA New Tourism Frontiers Forum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:59:59.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
