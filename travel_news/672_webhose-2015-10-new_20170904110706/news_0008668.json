Photographer's Note \nSérie sobre a minha visita à SERRA DA CANASTRA - Estado de MINAS GERAIS - Região SUDESTE do BRASIL - De 15 a 17 de Junho de 2012 - Nº 023 ! Series on my trip to the CANASTRA MOUNTAIN RANGE - State of MINAS GERAIS - SOUTHEASTERN Region of BRAZIL - From June 15th to 17th, 2012 - # 023 ! COMEMORANDO 2.002 FOTOS AQUI NO TREK EARTH ! CACHOEIRA DA CASCA D'ANTA (VI) vista DE FRENTE, à uma certa distância ! 903 FOTOS DO BRASIL ! CELEBRATING 2,0002 POSTS HERE ON TREK EARTH ! CASCA D'ANTA WATERFALLS (V) right in front of me, at a certain distance ! 903 POSTS FROM BRAZIL ! Falling for 186m, from the walls of CANASTRA MOUNTAIN RANGE's south rim, those waterfalls are really beautiful and one of the waterfalls in Brazil I always wanted to visit! It's really close to where the SÃO FRANCISCO RIVER is born and its waters are the ones that fall in that wonderful natural spot. The river then has a very long way to go up to its mouth, in the border of the States of ALAGOAS and SERGIPE, in the NORTHEASTERN Region of BRAZIL, being the longest river running only in the brazilian territory! Those falls are inside CANASTRA MOUNTAIN RANGE NATIONAL PARK, nearby the small village of SÃO JOSÉ DO BARREIRO, in the municipality of SÃO ROQUE DE MINAS! It's sort of hard to take a picture of them because of the light. Sunlight, specially during fall/wintertime, barely reaches them! This picture was taken after visiting it and seeing it in its lower part, from very close, with water splashing and sprinkling all over me (and my camera). Another point of view for those falls, as I moved away from it, along the trail to the entrance of the park!
