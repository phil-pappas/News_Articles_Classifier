Native falcons are rarer than kiwis and this is one of just two places in the country where they are bred and trained. \nOne is Fern, introduced to us by her handler, Diana Dobson. Fern was born of a mother with a shot wing and a father that was blind in one eye, and was raised in captivity. Despite her feathery bloomers, Fern is a perfect killing machine; with eyesight eight times better than ours, she can dive to spear a ladybird, at speeds approaching 150kmh. \nDiana waves a homemade lure – a pukeko wing on a fishing rod – but Fern's not quite in the mood and flies off to sit on a fence post about 150m away. Diana only has to put on her falcon glove and Fern spots it, swooping back and eagerly tucking into a duck neck. \n\"She's a wonderful personality – really like a great friend,\" Diana says. \"You do form a bond with them, though it's forged through food.\" \nThere's nothing wrong with that. I return to the eyrie to sample Brancott's sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, pinot gris, and pinot noir. Brancott was the first to plant sauvignon blanc vines here in 1973, radically changing the course of New Zealand's wine industry. \nLunch is as beautiful as the wine, with a soft, crusty ciabatta loaf from De Brood Bakkers paired with Marlborough Faversham olive oil, hummus and dukkah; venison tenderloin matched with the Terroir series pinot noir; and for dessert, the most perfect expression of affogato I have ever had – rich, fruity espresso with vanilla-bean icecream, matched with a luscious Letter Series B Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc. \nBrancott Estate offers a rare close-up encounter with a New Zealand falcon. Naomi Arnold Ad Feedback \nA short drive away is Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre, and inside is a remarkable exhibition: Sir Peter Jackson's World War I collection, Knights of the Sky, containing rare planes and artefacts from around the world. Our volunteer guide, Murray Winthrop, is animated and full of stories, bringing it all to life: the uniforms and rare medals, mementoes torn from downed aircraft, tales of escape or death. \nWingnut films and Weta Workshop have created the scenes here and it is a fascinating life-size diorama that will interest all. The planes are hung in striking formations from the ceiling, a soldier taking aim with a rifle from one, balancing on a wing in another, re-enacting true stories. In one, Allied forces are commandeering German boots; in another, foes are greeting each other in a snowy landscape. \n\"Peter wanted that,\" Murray says, pointing at a plane spectacularly crashed into a life-sized tree. The complementary World War II exhibition will open in June 2016, and is expected to have storytelling just as powerful, with some equally rare aviation treasures. \nNext, I check into Renwick's Hillsfield House, a beautifully presented B&B nestled in a sea of wineries. My host, Jo Hill, offers tea and scones, and I relax until the shuttle arrives to take me to dinner at Gibb's on Godfrey. \nBradley Hornby and Liz Buttimore have recently taken this over and we are treated to a special wine and food-matched meal, proceeding through diamond shell crab, octopus, Ora King salmon, smoked lamb, and finally, a deconstructed fruit and nut chocolate with vanilla snow and an incredible chilled apple and vanilla creme. All are beautifully presented as works of art, and matched with wine from the neighbours; the closest winery is next door, the furthest is a mere 4km away. \nI return to enjoy a night on heavenly sheets and pillows in my well-appointed room at Hillsfield, where the kettle is filled with water for me, a jar of ginger cookies is tucked in the fridge and sprigs of fresh rosemary are left on my pillow. \nThe next day, I meet Hillsfield's alpacas and ponies and then visit The Vines Village, a collection of compact stone-grey shops housing art, quilting materials, a cafe with delicious food, merino clothing, and the brightly coloured Alex Fulton Design Store. I can't resist buying a piece of local art and a rug, then it's on to Picton for a large and delicious salad at longstanding favourite Le Cafe, before a spot of fishing. \nMark Baxter welcomes us onboard the Tory. He's been taking people out fishing on the Marlborough Sounds for 25 years, and remembers when the regenerating hillsides were scrub and paddock. He's watched the wildling pines poisoned, sicken, and die in a massive conservation effort. The boat chugs over glassy seas, and Mark eases it into a bay so we can watch a seal gorging on a school of fish. Then a pod of dolphins appears, followed by more seals, shags, oystercatchers and plummeting gannets. \n\"The little fish don't stand a chance,\" Mark says. \"Dolphins down below and birds up top.\" \nAnd us. Soon we're hauling up flapping blue cod and, for two hours, I only have to drop the line over the side into the oily-calm surface and it's grabbed. \nI haul up a red cod that's half a metre long, but we throw it back – there's plenty to eat already, with those fat blue cod in the bottom of the bucket. But I am not eating fresh-caught blue cod tonight – I am dining at Punga Cove, a resort on the Queen Charlotte Track, and I have heard good things. \nMark leaves me in Endeavour Inlet, urging me to make sure I watch the All Blacks' game at Punga Cove's small bar/cafe, which is a major attraction for locals and moored yachties. \"Who are they playing?\" I ask, and he stutters in disbelief as he farewells me. \nBev and Ralph Faulkner meet me at the jetty, and one of the first things they tell me about is the spa, handing me a thick towel and apologising if I have to fight a whole three other guests for it. \nWinter, Bev says, is nice and quiet. There is also a pool: \"It's not heated, but some masochists use it,\" she says. \"Or they jump off the jetty. It seems to be the mountainbikers.\" \nBev shows me to a spacious, private Kiwi chalet, and I'm spellbound by the view and the peace. The outer sounds are free of the petty tyranny of wifi and cellphone reception; even the newspapers aren't delivered until 11am, arriving daily from Picton by water taxi. \nFrom Punga Cove, Endeavour Inlet appears as a deep turquoise lake. Image: Supplied \nFrom my chalet's balcony I can't even see the entrance to the rest of the inlet – instead, it feels like I am suspended above a deep lake, tinted in shades of blue and turquoise. Bright green bush hugs layers of ridges down to the water, with just a strip of golden shoreline snaking around the edges. \nThe restaurant at Punga Cove is heated by a large gas fire, and it's warm and cosy as I settle into a Villa Maria pinot gris. I take a seat by the window and two hours fly by as I chat with the other guests and listen to the happy burbling of a Wellington couple, snuggled close together and raising a toast to each other. \nI have an entree of greenshell mussels in a silky Thai green sauce with soft homemade bread, and then carve tender slivers of grilled Angus beef fillet, aged for 21 days. As I walk back to my chalet, a weka scuttles across the path and a distant morepork calls. I'm sitting outside in the spa when I hear hollering nearby and can't resist finding out what's happening: I walk into the tiny bar to find a gently lit verandah over the water and the All Blacks about to thrash the Wallabies. \nAt sunrise, I get up early for a run along the Queen Charlotte Track in beautiful pink light, to make room for a pile of salty-sweet bacon and banana pancakes, drenched in maple syrup. \nThe Cougar Line water taxi arrives at 10.30am, and it's a pleasant cruise back to Picton for a midday wine tasting at Wairau River Wines – as well as the famous blue cheese souffle that's never been off the menu, and creme brulee to finish. \nLater, I return to Hillsfield House for more wine – but this time, it's with Wine Tours by Bike, which is the only way to enjoy a tasting. The cellar doors are so close that driving would be ridiculous , and cycling allows you to taste as much as you want, with about half a dozen visits making the perfect afternoon. \nREAD MORE: \n*Marlborough wineries urged to cater for Chinese tourists \nAt Gibson Bridge, Forrest Wines and Framingham, the staff are knowledgeable and hospitable, and I leave with a much better wine appreciation and with a couple of bottles, as well. As at Gibb's, I notice how neighbourly the entire area is, how connected the wineries, how easily you can wind between them, meeting friendly and passionate people at the doors, and greeting other happy groups of cyclists. It is a wonderful playground for grown-ups intent on eating, drinking and digesting under clear blue skies, and then doing it all over again. \nI recall what Mark said on the boat, as the water lapped Tory's flanks and we stared at the tips of our twitching fishing rods. \n\"The best-kept secret in New Zealand is winter in the sounds.\" \nI can only agree. Out on the water, there were more dolphins than people. Winter and early spring are marvellously free of sunburn, jet skis and crowds, and you feel as though you're one of a handful of people discovering these striped vineyards, world-class wine and food, lovely people, and deep-blue scalloped bays. \nNaomi Arnold for Avenues magazine.
