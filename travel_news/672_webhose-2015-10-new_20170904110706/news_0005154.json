With a vibrant art and cultural scene, Portugal’s second city is perfect for a weekend break. PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sat, Oct 10, 2015 GETTY Traditional Rabelo boats are used to transport port on the River Douro \nI have always associated a glass of port with cosy Christmas festivities, accompanied by a hunk of stilton, a handful of Quality Street, and the Strictly Come Dancing special. \nBut it turns out it tastes just as good while wearing shorts and a T-shirt on a sunny afternoon, particularly in the form of a white port and tonic cocktail, Porto’s local speciality aperitif. Served in a long glass over ice with a twist of orange zest, it is the perfect substitute for a cool G&T. \nAnd it is hard to imagine a better place to sip one than the terrace of luxury wine hotel The Yeatman, where my sister and I sat catching some rays on our late summer weekend break. \nSet among the 18th-century warehouses and wine cellars, or “caves”, of Vila Nova de Gaia, on the south side of the river Douro, the hotel has surely the best view in Portugal’s second city. \nFrom here, as from each of The Yeatman’s 82 rooms, and its decanter-shaped infinity pool, voted one of the best in the world, you can gaze dreamily across to the Ribeira, Porto’s historic centre. \nThis is one of the oldest cities in Europe and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a patchwork of skinny, colourful, terracotta-roofed buildings, gothic and baroque churches and imposing cathedral, all staggering down a steep hill towards the waterfront that buzzes with activity, outdoor bars and restaurants. \nTraditional flat-bottomed Rabelo boats, piled high with barrels, bob alongside. These were used for centuries to transport wine down the river from the Douro Valley, the only place where the grapes to produce genuine port are allowed to be grown, to the cellars where it is still produced, bottled and exported worldwide. \nPorto is a compact city, one that is easy to feel you have “done” in a relaxing weekend, and as a result there has been an upsurge in British visitors coming to Porto as a destination in its own right in the last couple of years. \nAs well as fascinating history and architecture, easy access to the beach, warm weather during spring and autumn and, of course, its famous fortified wine, it is only a two-hour hop from the UK on a budget airline. EasyJet launched new routes here this summer, from Luton, Bristol and Manchester. GETTY A city tram is a great way to see the sights and colourful buildings of historic Porto \nThen there is the fact that, as European city breaks go, Porto offers great value. \nThe Yeatman hotel is five star, with the fabulous Caudalie Vinothérapie spa, a Michelin-starred restaurant serving modern twists on Portuguese cuisine, such as suckling pig, and the largest wine cellar in Portugal, with 27,000 bottles to choose from. But its huge, plush rooms start from just £120 a night. \nExploring Porto is easy, as long as you bring comfortable shoes. Like Portugal’s capital, Lisbon, the hills and the steep, cobbled, medieval streets, strung with washing billowing in the breeze, are a hike. \nWe reached them from our hotel via the Dom Luis I bridge, that links Vila Nova de Gaia and Ribeira. The bridge’s style may strike you as familiar, having been completed in 1886 by a student of Gustave Eiffel, of Paris tower fame. Rather than climb to the bridge’s top deck, for more vertigo-inducing views, you can catch a cable car which swings you over the long, red roofs of the wine lodges. \nMore fun transport includes a rickety antique tram that we caught outside Igreja de Sao Francisco, an austere gothic church on the outside, an explosion of gold leaf inside, to take us all the way along the river to the sea, and the smart beachside district of Foz for the day. \nHere we strolled the palm-tree studded esplanade, where locals jog or cycle alongside a series of sandy beaches and rocky coves, ideal for sunbathing, paddling or, for the brave, a dip in the freezing Atlantic. \nPorto is also an arty city, with plenty of independent galleries and boutique shops for unique souvenirs, and don’t miss the Livraria Lello bookshop, especially if you are a Harry Potter fan. Opened in 1906, it has a neo-gothic interior with a stained glass ceiling and winding staircase that was supposedly an inspiration for one in Hogwarts (JK Rowling was an English teacher in Porto in the early 1990s). \nAnother must is a visit to one of Porto’s many wine lodges. We opted for a tour of Taylor’s, which, next door to The Yeatman hotel, is run by the same family. \nFor just five euros, you can have a tour of its cool, sweet-smelling, barrel-lined cellars. Our enthusiastic guide Ana Margarida explained the difference between ruby and tawny port, the latter being aged in small wooden barrels for up to 40 years; and the history of late bottle vintage (LBV), a post-war invention to satisfy a market that could no longer afford to buy Taylor’s best vintage port, which aged for decades in bottles can fetch thousands of pounds. \nWe tried some, along with a glass of 10-year-old tawny, in Taylor’s very British manicured garden, all included within the cost of the tour. As the Portuguese would say, “Saude!”– or “cheers!”– to that. GETTY Try a port tasting at one of dozens of historic wine cellars Ten things you must do in Porto \n1.
