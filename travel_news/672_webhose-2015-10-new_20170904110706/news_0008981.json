Everything Greig does at the moment, the kids want to emulate. We've got a mini­rugby festival going on and I've got 180 kids aged between nine and 12 coming from four schools: Jedburgh Grammar School, Parkside Primary, Howdenburn Primary, and Ancrum Primary schools. No doubt they'll all want to climb into a wheelie bin. They'll want to do whatever they see Greg doing. There's no question that Greig's a leader. He's always had that leadership role That's the beauty of Rugby World Cup 2015 . I've been in the primary schools this week and all last week and all the kids have been watching the rugby. Greig has been getting a lot of mentions and they all seem to be really keen on the sport. It's great for Jed Forest. Everyone up here’s been impressed by his performance coming off the bench last week. Greig kind of made the game change. He's got a very big influence not just as a captain but as a player, too. The kids were really pleased to see him in action. Leading by example There's no question that Greig's a leader. He's always had that leadership role. He speaks well in the changing room and on the training ground. For me he's always been a player who has had that quality and Scotland are benefiting from that. When he works with young kids, he speaks very well and all the kids listen. He was at the primary schools up here last year delivering a talk on nutrition. It left a lasting impression with the children. It was all about health, hygiene and well being. Health is more a part of the game now, of course. Ice to see you: part of Greig's post-match recovery regime Photo: PA It's not just about how you look after yourself on the field, it's about how you look after yourself off the field as well. You've got to be professional. The kids take that kind of advice in, and then when they see him in action in these huge games, it hits home to them that he is the man who urged them to be clean, and to eat clean. Scotland v South Africa Saturday is going to be a huge day for Greig's old club Jed Forest as we watch Scotland's biggest game of the group when they face South Africa. We've got the ex­captains, presidents and the older members coming down. I think Roy Laidlaw, Greig’s uncle who played for Scotland, will be down there too. It’s still amazing that we’ve had three Scotland captains in Greig, Roy and Gary Armstrong as it’s only a small town. There's going to be a big lunch and then dinner. I think it's £2 a pint all day, so I think there will be a lot of people sticking around. It’s still amazing that a small town has produced three Scotland captains Greig will be getting support from some old friends at St James' Park for the match, too. There's a group of his mates from Jed Thistle under 18s who are all going down there on Friday night before the game and will meet him at the hotel. It's great that they've made such an effort. One of his mates, Ryan, just came over from Australia. They're all going to meet him before the game. I think they might be going out for lunch with him on Sunday too. When Greig comes home, he always meets up with his mates and goes to the pub. He's never forgotten them. We're hoping it will be a great weekend for Jed, and Scotland. We'll hear every little detail from the kids on Tuesday, who will be watching Greig's every move. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:21:50.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
