Since its inception, the QA seal has also been a way for quality restaurants to gain a competitive edge and to encourage a quality leap in the sector through the creation of benchmarks.\nFollowing the first call for application 72 restaurants, representing over 10% of all licensed establishments on the islands, were awarded the QA seal. It is also encouraging to note that 15 of these restaurants are based in Gozo. The restaurants were awarded the QA seal during a presentation held last May. During the restaurant awards ceremony Scruples, Sa Re Ga Ma & de Mondion won the Best in Class award in their respective category, whilst the Blue Elephant, Quadro & de Mondion won the Best Hospitality Award. Whilst the QA seal is valid for a two-year period with an interim visit, the special awards are valid for a one year period.\nThe criteria of the QA seal cover all the essential elements that constitute a good dining experience, from the quality of service to hospitality, food and the overall environment of the restaurant. The criteria are revised regularly to ensure continuous improvement; an example of two new restaurant criteria for 2016 are the inclusion of a criterion requiring a minimum of 30% or 20 bottles of wine from locally grown grapes available at all QA restaurants as well as a criterion covering training on basic first aid.\nSource:- MTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:46:28.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
