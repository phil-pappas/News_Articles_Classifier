The high season for Down Under cruises is October to March, which is spring and summer on that side of the equator. There are many itinerary variations, but one-way, 12-day or more sailings between Auckland and Sydney give you a taste of both of these big countries. \nPre- and post-cruise tours allow time to explore Auckland and its nearby islands, Sydney and its islands and nearby mountains and such places as the Great Barrier Reef. Here are some of our favorite experiences. \nBirds: On New Zealand’s Otago Peninsula, you can catch sight of feathered giants at the Royal Albatross Centre and glimpse rare yellow-eyed penguins. Near the Art Deco town of Napier, a visit to Cape Kidnappers allows time to walk among a whole colony of gannets. In Australia, listen for the “laughing” call of the Kookaburra, and near Melbourne, watch penguins on their nightly parade on Phillip Island. \nFjords: Writer Rudyard Kipling called the spectacular glacier-carved fjord known as Milford Sound “the eighth wonder of the world.” Cut through snow-covered mountains, the scene there is little changed since being discovered by Maoris more than 1,000 years ago. There’s a catch to exploration in this part of New Zealand’s southwest coast, though. If you’re lucky the water will be as flat and beautiful as ice. But if you hit a storm, the trip to the Fjordlands National Park can be rough and you may or may not get to the views you’ve come to see. \nThe Hobbit and Lord of the Rings: Locations for the Peter Jackson movies are the focus of shore excursions including to the Hobbiton movie set, from Tauranga, New Zealand. But the ethereal scenery on New Zealand’s North and South islands – rugged mountains, lakes and lush green valleys – will remind you of the movies whether you visit the actual sets or not. \nTasmania: Hobart is a hidden jewel on the itinerary. Ocean-view roads lead to wineries, scenic outlooks, nature centers where you can learn about the Tasmanian Devil (not just a comic book creation but a real carnivorous marsupial) and the Port Arthur penal colony, a UNESCO World Heritage site. \nThe Great Barrier Reef: Exploring the world’s largest coral reef system is an opportunity not to be missed. Choose a cruise itinerary that includes Cairns or plan to fly up from Sydney. If you don’t snorkel or dive, there are glass-bottom boat and submarine tours that show off the coral and some of the more than 1,500 fish species, sea turtles, whales and other marine creatures that hang out here. \nSydney BridgeClimb: Sydney and Auckland are both cosmopolitan cities with a wealth of attractions. But for bragging rights, nothing tops a climb on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. After a training session you put on a special suit and harness and hit the ladders and catwalks to reach the structure’s upper arch, some 400 feet above the water. It is safe but spectacular. \nWild creatures: You may find opportunity at zoos or nature centers to hug a koala. Kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, crocodiles and platypus may be among other sights, including in the wild. Just figuring out which wild and unusual animals are displayed in black outline on yellow roadway warning signs is a fun challenge – the creatures are far from the deer shapes you’re used to seeing at home. \nGeysers and Maori culture: On a fascinating excursion from Tauranga to Rotorua, New Zealand, you can see hot lava and steam spurt from the earth, witness an exuberant display of Haka dancing and combat skills and dine on such traditional dishes as pig cooked underground. \nLocal experiences onboard: Cruise lines including Royal Caribbean, Princess, Holland America and Celebrity Cruises cater on the route to not just Americans but also Australian and Kiwi passengers. Regionally focused adaptations mean you can sample local beer and wine, try vegemite and meat pies and sample such dishes as New Zealand Salmon Wellington, green-lipped mussels and New Zealand lamb. Local performers will come onboard – including hysterically naughty comedians – and the nightlife may be more lively than usual. \nActive excursions: Surfing on sand dunes, rafting whitewater rapids in a rainforest, bungee jumping, kayaking to a geothermal bath and swimming through a glowworm cave are among the many adrenaline-rush adventures available en-route.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:45.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
