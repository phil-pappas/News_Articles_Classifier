He later admitted on Russian state television that the entire operation had been planned well in advance. \nThe Kremlin leader’s hostile approach to his western neighbor and expansionist dreams launched a global trade war that saw Russia ban the import of most western food. Brussels and Washington’s own sanctions included freezing the foreign assets of close Putin allies and partial bans on investments in Russia’s vital energy industry. \nThe flight spat started with Poroshenko’s announcement on 16 September that Russian airlines would soon be barred from landing in – but not flying over – Ukraine because of Moscow’s refusal to hand back Crimea. Russia denounced the decision as “madness” before responding with similar measures this month. \nA desperate round of negotiations between the two sides in Brussels on Friday ended without any immediate solution in sight. Russian authorities estimate that some 800,000 people flew between the two countries in the first eight months of the year. \nTravelers must now look into other less convenient, more expensive options including slow overnight train rides and flights via other countries on relatively good terms with both sides.
