The event will provide families who have a child or children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), the opportunity to have a “curb-to-plane” experience at the airport to be better prepared for travel.\nThe flight rehearsal provides families the opportunity to simulate the steps involved in traveling through an airport. The experience includes airport parking, entering the airport, checking a bag, going through security, waiting at the gate, boarding the airplane, preflight safety, exiting the airplane, collecting their bag at baggage claim and departing the airport.\nThis program is beneficial for children with autism as it allows the child to go through the airport and airplane boarding process at their own pace, helping them to process what’s going on and learning what to expect. Fly SAAFE is designed to alleviate some of the stress that families have when traveling by air. There will be experts from TAFA, TUS, and TSA, along with volunteers, to help each family at every step of the process.\n“Fly SAAFE” will be held on October 29th from 5:00 p.m. to 7 p.m. and is open to all families affected by ASD. Space is limited and registration through TAFA is required.\n \nSource:- Fly Tucson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:41:29.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
