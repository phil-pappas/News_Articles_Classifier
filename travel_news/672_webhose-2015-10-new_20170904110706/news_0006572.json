Now, with the AA's new app, you can track the progress of your breakdown patrol, so you know exactly when to expect it. Even better, you can report a breakdown using the app. And because the software uses the latest technology to record your location, you don't even need to know where you are. As well as making life easier for the millions of stranded motorists who call the AA each year, the app displays general information that is of use when you’re on the road. For example, it features the motoring organisation’s famous route planner. That means you can work out how best to get to your destination and gain a sense of your travel time, then display the information on your phone. The app gives members up-to-date parking information To help the journey pass as smoothly as possible, the app also provides AA members with real-time traffic information. As a result, you can adjust your route on the hop, to avoid the worst of the jams. The app's utility doesn’t end when you reach your destination. It gives members up-to-date parking information, including details about prices and space availability. So you can head to the best spot, secure in the knowledge that you’ll find a space, with a clear idea of the cost. What's more, it will drop a pin into the map, so that you're able to get back to the car park on foot once you're ready to hit the road. Another exclusive feature for AA members is the fuel-price calculator. This locates petrol stations in your vicinity and lets you compare prices. Identify the cheapest one, and it will then plot a route to get you there for a fill-up. It can also remind you about MOT, tax and insurance renewal dates Even when you're not on the road, the app is a valuable source of information. For example, it can be programmed to remind you about MOT, tax and insurance renewal dates, as well as recording service intervals for your car. It also has a handy warning-lights function. This provides a detailed guide to help you interpret warning messages on your dashboard, as well as information about the appropriate way to respond. By using the very latest technology, the AA app makes life much easier for the organisation's 14.5 million members. When you think that the first patrols attended breakdowns on their bicycles, it shows you just how much the world has changed since the organisation was founded in 1905.
