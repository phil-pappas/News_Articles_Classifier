Almost 50 percent of flyers would opt for credit toward their next ticket purchase according to surveys conducted by GO Airport Express, a Chicago-based ground transportation service. \nThe transportation companies, part of The GO Group, presented a fictional scenario in which travelers would be offered one of four options. While ticket credit was the clear winner, seats with more leg room was the second choice (32%), followed by priority boarding and free meals and beverage at 11 and nine percent respectively. More than 850 people responded to the surveys. There was no significant difference in responses from men or women or age groups. \nWrite-in suggestions included upgrade to first class, access to the airport lounge and the option to be the only passenger on a plane. \n\"Traveling economically still seems to be a priority,\" says John McCarthy, president, GO Airport Express.
