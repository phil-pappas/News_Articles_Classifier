By Brian E. Clark (0) Comments \nI've kayaked exciting white-water rivers through deep mountain gorges in the West and canoed on placid lakes in the Badger State, Minnesota and Canada. \nBut none of that quite compares with a recent paddling outing I did with my 13-year-old son, Anders, on the Chicago River through the skyscraper canyons of the Loop. It didn't have any big rapids — so practically anyone can do it — but there were huge, barge-like tour boats and pleasure craft that we had to avoid. \nOur outing focused on the stunning architecture of the Windy City's downtown. We began at the headquarters of Kayak Chicago on W. Le Moyne St. along the river, where guides Matt Moll, Travis Patterson and Victoria Bosch gave our group some paddling and safety tips. \nThen we lugged our boats down to the North Branch of the Chicago River and slipped them into water across from Goose Island. \nWe paddled a bit and then rafted up across from the Wrigley Global Innovation Center, which opened in 2005. The three-story building is home to the company's international headquarters, labs, a glass-dome winter garden with more than two dozen plant species, and a pilot plant used for testing new machinery and manufacturing processes for the latest gum and candy products. \nFollowing river etiquette, we hugged the right shore and paddled south past some high-end condos that Moll said demand top dollar. Because the temperature was in the mid-70s, several residents were sitting on their patios and balconies reading newspapers. \nTheir expensive dwellings were a far cry from the squatters' shanties that once filled parts of Goose Island starting in the 1840s. Most of the residents were poor immigrants from Ireland, and Moll said industrialist/railroad tycoon William Ogden worked them hard in his factories while paying them little. The island is now best known for the Goose Island beers that share the same name. \nWhile our group had less than two dozen paddlers, Kayak Chicago also offers nighttime, fireworks tours that can draw more than 100. That, Moll said, can be somewhat akin to herding cats, especially when inexperienced kayakers drive the bows of their boats into the sterns of other kayaks and send them into the middle of the river. \nSoon we were at the southern tip of Goose Island, where the massive Montgomery Ward Complex, which is a National Historic Landmark, loomed on the east side. Opened in 1908, it bends with the river and was once home to the nation's oldest mail order firm — a precursor of sorts to Amazon. The building is topped with a statue of Diana called \"The Spirit of Progress.\" \nAs we paddled by the 1,000-foot-long structure, Moll told us that it was big enough for 24 railroad freight cars to be driven in for shipments. \nIn contrast to Ogden, Moll said owner Aaron Montgomery Ward was a generous man, not only to his thousands of employees but to the city of Chicago, which he bequeathed land that later became parks along Lake Michigan. He was also known as the \"protector of Grant Park\" for his efforts to keep it from becoming developed. \nWe passed under several drawbridges, which Moll told us were built in the trunnion bascule style, which uses a huge counterweight to lift the spans so boats can pass underneath. Because of a clever design, Moll said, a motor not much larger than a lawn mower engine is needed to initiate the lifting process. Then gravity takes over, he said. \nNext up was the Nuveen Building on the south side of the river where it jogs east toward Lake Michigan. This high rise, which bends at the confluence of the north and south branches of the river, has a curved facade that consists entirely of blue-green glass. It was finished in 1983 and featured in the 1986 movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\" (His dad worked there.) \nNot too far from the Nuveen skyscraper, but on the north side of the river, we came to the massive Merchandise Mart. When it was built 85 years ago, it was the globe's biggest man-made structure with more than 4 million square feet of floor space. Built in the art deco style by Marshall Field & Co., it was owned by the Kennedy family for five decades and now houses the Illinois Institute of Art and 1871, a technology start-up hub. \nAt the terminus of our kayaking tour, we paddled by the Riverwalk and looked up to see the Marina Towers, which consist of two corncob-shaped, 65-story towers. Designed by Bertrand Goldberg and opened in 1964, Moll told us it was meant to be a \"city within a city,\" boasting its own grocery store, movie theater, shops, a swimming pool, ice rink, restaurants, gymnasium, bowling alley and a marina on the river for residents' watercraft. Today, the complex is home to the House of Blues. \nAcross the street from the towers is the AMA building, designed by architect Mies van der Rohe, considered one of the pioneers of unadorned modern architecture. Moll said Goldberg was a student of van der Rohe's and the teacher was not pleased with the corncob towers. So, the story goes, he designed a building next door to block tenants' views of Lake Michigan. \nFrom our floating perches far below, we could also look and see the Trump Tower, built on the site of the former home of the Chicago Sun-Times, and farther down the river, the Tribune building. By then, we'd paddled more than two miles, so Moll, Patterson and Bosch rounded up their flock and we slowly made our way back north. \nMy son and I had a two-person boat and he nodded off a time or two on the return trip, leaving the paddling to me for long stretches. Sometime down the road, I hope he'll return the favor. \nMore information: Contact Kayak Chicago at (312) 852-9258 or see kayakchicago.com . The company runs tours through the end of October and then again beginning in May. \nGetting there: Chicago is 90 miles south of Milwaukee via I-94. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:16:58.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
