An obligatory fair warning before getting started: My thoughts on production probably will be briefer than those on perception. I’ll try not to rant too much about the latter, but you know how it goes. My tolerance for unquantifiable, mythical perceptions about certain players shrivels every day.\nBefore my wailing and fist-shaking about that begins, let’s discuss Ortiz’s production, specifically a cool quirk in his remarkable 2015 season – or remarkable partial season, at least, given that he was hitting .219 on June 10 before slashing a Vintage Papi-like .303/.394/.650 with 30 homers and 84 RBIs in his next 92 games.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below It’s been an imbalanced season for sure. There’s no doubt some of that monstrous second-half production would have helped in the first half, when hopes of contention slipped from grasp.\nBut in the end, he’ll have huge numbers – and very familiar huge numbers at that. Have you noticed the astonishing statistical near-symmetry of Ortiz’s past two seasons? Well, check it out then:\nHere’s his key stat line from 2014: .263/.355./.517, 142 games, 602 plate appearances, 518 at-bats, 136 hits, 35 HRs, 104 RBIs, 75 walks, 95 strikeouts, .872 OPS, 140 adjusted OPS.\nAnd from 2015 with four games remaining: .272/.359/.547, 144 games, 608 plate appearances, 523 at-bats, 142 hits, 36 homers, 105 RBIs, 76 walks, 95 strikeouts, .906 OPS, 139 adjusted OPS.\n(In case you were wondering, his adjusted OPS is a point lower this year even though his numbers are slightly better because offense is up around the major leagues this season. He was 40 percent above average last year, 39 percent this year.)\nThe point? I’m not sure I have one beyond marveling at the obvious. David Ortiz’s age 38 and 39 seasons – ages when precipitous drop-off should be expected – have been virtually identical in their excellence. Or should I say, in his excellence.\nMaybe in some circles that’s something that would bring suspicion. In this space, the acknowledgment doubles as an honest appreciation.\nIt may seem, because he’s doing what he’s always done, like it will last forever. It won’t. Hopefully you don’t require the reminder to savor who Ortiz is and what he has done for the Red Sox: He is on the short list of the franchise’s all-time most charismatic players, and ranks No. 1 on the list of its most important in terms of changing their history and perception. As a key member of three World Series-winning teams, his contributions to meaningful victories are arguably greater than any Red Sox player before or since.\nBut I’m putting a reminder right here for those who do. Because sometimes the chasm between fans’ perception of him and the reality of his production and reliability in more than a dozen years in Boston, particularly measured against the prevailing views about his teammates, drives me nuts.\nI was raised as a Boston sports fan, and in as many ways as I still can be, I remain one. That doesn’t mean interacting with my own kind isn’t aggravating from time to time. The back-and-forth can be satisfying and aggravating within a span of seconds, particularly when Twitter is the medium in use.\nThe perception of Ortiz has been a personal nuisance lately, and part of that is my own doing, I suppose. A week or so ago, I wrote an appreciative column about Ortiz in the wake of his 500th career home run, followed a few days later by a piece suggesting Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski should at least consider trading Dustin Pedroia in the offseason. Many agreed with both views. Some agreed with one, but not the other. There were reasonable responses, really, some well-considered ones.\nThen there were the dissenters – those who reacted as if I’d suggested naming Hanley Ramirez the manager and starting shortstop next season. A couple of examples:\n@GlobeChadFinn Dustin is the veteran of the future with the heart to keep the young guys focused.\n— Tim Leonard (@tleonard983) September 20, 2015 @tleonard983 @GlobeChadFinn AGREE 100%. He is a no-ego, 100% Charlie Hustle example. Without him, it all turns to the showboating ego show.\n— Lou Flynn (@LouFlynn_ted9) September 20, 2015 Now, no one needs to explain to me why fans adore Pedroia. He plays with a hellbent relentlessness, like all of us surely still would if only that stupid jayvee high school coach had recognized our abilities extended beyond keeping the scorebook. Small in stature, he has a huge, fearless rip of a swing to match the outsized chip on his surly shoulder. When healthy, he’s very, very good at baseball.\nFans may forget that, unlike Ortiz, Pedroia actually arrived in Boston as a top prospect in the Red Sox farm system, despite his size. Before being selected in the second round of the 2004 MLB Draft by the Sox, the California native had been a finalist for the Golden Spikes Award, the top individual honor in amateur baseball, while excelling for Arizona State . Pedroia quickly rose through the minor leagues and finished the 2006 season playing alongside Ortiz at Fenway. In 2007, he was named the American League’s rookie of the year at age 24. A year later, he was voted the league’s most valuable player.\nWhile Ortiz’s larger-than-life persona and stately home run trots may be anathema to those who celebrate athletes with a blue-collar persona, his circuitous journey to Boston is undeniably a testament to his perserverance, and maybe the fallibility of talent evaluation around the majors. Originally signed by the Seattle Mariners as a teenager out of the Dominican Republic in 1992, Ortiz landed in Minnesota as the “ player to be named later ” in a 1996 trade. After that indignity, he reached the majors with the Twins in 1997, but was released in December 2002. At age 27, he was signed by the Red Sox before the 2003 season with 455 career games and 58 home runs on his MLB resume.\nThe rest, as they say, is history, glorious history.\nBoth players are more than worthy of adoration throughout New England for as long as games are played at Fenway. Yet, Pedroia tends to be mythologized for intangible traits while Ortiz is too often second-guessed when his numbers don’t add up fast enough at the start of a season. The Pedroia hagiography doesn’t rival what Yankees fans and the national media did with Derek Jeter—taking a brilliant player and adding attributes that don’t exist to justify his spot on a higher pedestal than is deserved – but it is the closest we’ve got to that.\nWe do it by lauding him for a lack of ego, even though every player who has ever dreamed of playing in the major leagues, let alone has actually achieved that dream, must have a healthy self-belief.\nWe do it by jabbering about leadership skills, even though leadership in baseball does nothing to help a teammate hit a 98 miles-per-hour fastball on the outside corner.\nWorst of all, we do it by attributing the success of others to his presumed intangibles. Xander Bogaerts and Mookie Betts aren’t the Red Sox’ two best players in 2015 at age 22 because of some prospect-whispering done by Pedroia (or Ortiz, for that matter, though I should note that the intrinsic if still unquantifiable value Ortiz’s leadership is much more evident than Pedroia’s is ).\nThey’re succeeding because of their own talent, confidence, and ability to adjust. Pedroia (or anyone else) is not helping Bogaerts get a single one of his near 200 hits now. If anyone had such power, you’d think they’d have done it when he all but went 0-for-the-summer last year.\nPlease, if you are one of these people, give players credit for what they do, not what you perceive them to be doing based on your own preferences and preconceptions. I swear, some of you attributing these super-captain leadership skills to Pedroia are the same ones who think Jason Varitek should still be wearing the carmine C and catching every other day. And if you think that, well, please don’t tell me, especially not on Twitter.\nGreat moments from David Ortiz\nPrevious -- of -- Next Boston Red Sox's David Ortiz watches his 500th career home run off Tampa Bay Rays starting pitcher Matt Moore during the fifth inning of a baseball game Saturday, Sept. 12, 2015, in St. Petersburg, Fla. watching is Rays catcher J.P.
