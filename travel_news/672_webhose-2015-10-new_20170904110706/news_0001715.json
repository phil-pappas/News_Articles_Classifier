It’s been deleted four times this morning. There’s no information in Budapest”. \nHer annoyance turned into fury when she received a response that poked fun at her choice of career. \n“Flight is scheduled for 14.30. It’s just that with you, we prefer when it lasts longer. Have a good day. I remain available,” the Transavia tweet read, compete with a winking face. @NikitaBellucciX => vol est prévu pour 14h30. C'est juste qu'avec vous on préfète quand ça dure. ;) Bonne journée, je reste disponible. :) — Transavia France (@transaviaFR) October 12, 2015 \nFollowing outrage from her supporters, the airline issued a grovelling apology in a series of Tweets. \n“I am sorry you were offended by this joke. I was just trying to lighten the mood. Again, I’m sorry. The plane will leave shortly.” \nIt was followed by a second tweet, reading: “Good evening, we return to you for again we apologise for this tweet and our delay. Our customer service will contact you soon by email about the delay of our flight. Good night.” @NikitaBellucciX Je ss dsl que vs ayez mal pris cette blague. :( J'essayais juste de détendre l'atmosphère. Encore désolé, on repart vite. — Transavia France (@transaviaFR) October 12, 2015 \nThe actress has since taken to Twitter to hit out at those who had insulted her. \n“In France, unfortunately I have noticed that if you are a porn star, you don’t have the right to want to cultivate your mind and you must not share your opinions on the news. \n“Open your thighs, look beautiful and shut up ... is all that’s allowed. That’s all we expect of you, nothing more.” \nnews.com.au has contacted Transavia for comment.
