We need courage and cohesion which Europe has always shown when it was necessary\" she added. \n\nGermany is Europe's top destination for people fleeing war and misery in the continent's greatest migrant influx since World War II. It expects between 8 and one million newcomers this year alone. \n\nGerman authorities said Wednesday they had registered around 577000 asylum seekers in the first nine months of the year a third of whom claim to be Syrian. \n\n\n\nRisk of 'total war' \n\nHollande meanwhile admitted that the EU had reacted too slowly to the turmoil on its borders since the Arab Spring in 2011 which produced the huge wave of refugees seeking a better life in Europe. \n\n\"I acknowledge that Europe was slow in understanding that tragedy in the Middle East or Africa could not but have consequences for Europe itself\" he said. \n\nHollande also gave a dire warning of a regional conflagration in the Middle East that could affect Europe if the world fails to stop the slaughter in Syria where an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 has spiralled into all-out civil war. \n\n\"What happens in Syria concerns Europe what happens there will determine the balance of the whole region for a long time\" Hollande said. \"If we leave these religious clashes between Sunnis and Shiites they will grow. Don't think we will be sheltered this will be a total war.\" \n\nThe last time the leaders of France and Germany stood together in the parliament was 26 years ago when Francois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl gave a speech just weeks after the Berlin Wall fell. \n\nIn a high-profile talk show appearance later on Wednesday Merkel defended her welcoming stance towards the refugees and said she was proud of the \"friendly face\" Germany had shown the world. \n\nBut she admitted that coping with the challenges posed by the influx of asylum seekers would be \"a difficult task\" for the country perhaps the most challenging since the reunification of East and West Germany 25 years ago. \n\n\nAircraft carrier \n\nThe EU also formally launched \"Operation Sophia\" on Wednesday which gives European naval vessels in international waters off Libya the power to stop board seize and destroy people traffickers' boats. \n\nAround 3000 people have died making the perilous crossing over the Mediterranean to Europe this year. \n\nThe first phase of the operation which involved monitoring trafficker networks and rescuing refugees from rickety boats has been running since June. \n\nThe UN Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution that would give UN approval to the naval task force as early as Thursday. The resolution is not mandatory for the European Union to take action but would provide Operation Sophia with greater legitimacy. \n\nAn Italian aircraft carrier a French frigate and one British one Spanish and two German ships are all involved in the mission which follows in the footsteps of EU anti-piracy operations in the Horn of Africa. \n\n\"We follow the traffickers and want to arrest them and seize their ships\" Captain Stefan Klatt who commands the Werra one of the German ships that is taking part in the operation told AFP. \n\nAt least three other vessels supplied by the Belgian British and Slovenian navies are expected to arrive in the area at the end of October to complete the force which also include four aircraft and 1318 personnel. \n\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:05:07.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
