This is the first IATA educational program to be taught in real time by instructors in a virtual environment. The inaugural session will begin 2 November 2015. \nThe program is built around the strategic needs of the airline industry in leadership development. This followed an intensive series of needs assessment interviews by IATA and HBP with key industry stakeholders. These identified their strategic business goals, challenges and trends that would need to be addressed in the development of high potential senior managers and business leaders. The result was the development of a curriculum of three modules: (1) leadership and influence, (2) operational excellence, (3) global mindset and collaboration. An IATA-HBP certificate is awarded upon successful completion of the program. \n\"Economic forecasts call for a doubling of air travel by 2032. Meeting that demand will require significant growth in the aviation workforce and the development of future leaders. The partnership of IATA and HBP has created a world-class educational opportunity for aviation professionals. And the virtually learning approach of the Aviation Leadership Development Program will provide participants the opportunity to develop business-critical skills and interact with their peers globally while minimizing travel expenses and out-of-office time,\" said Victor de Barrena, Director, ITDI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:37:53.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
