But with future improvements in infrastructure – particularly the High Speed 2 rail line between London and Birmingham, and Crossrail in the capital and the South East – the way people move around the country is set to change. Meanwhile, the construction of the planned new nuclear power station, Hinkley Point C, is poised to become the epicentre of a whole new economic ecosystem in Somerset. So, while it is becoming increasingly feasible for business owners to leave the pokiness, rents and rates behind, there are more than a few opportunities for businesses able to take advantage in and around London. Most staff will be more likely to support change if they feel as though they have been part of the ideas and planning process But with such opportunities to move come immense risks. So where would a business begin? For many business owners, the most obvious challenge will be deciding on the location, with factors such as access to public transport, roads and motorways, parking, accessibility to client sites and the nature of employees’ commutes the main considerations. They will also want to make sure that they have local access to a sufficiently deep talent pool of potential employees to provide a sustainable workforce for years ahead. Existing staff must be brought on board immediately once a new location has been agreed on, however. While relocation away from London might present some obvious advantages in terms of cost efficiencies, more comfortable premises and a better quality of life for employees, for instance, translating the business case to each employee’s individual circumstance is not so simple. Colin Allan, managing director of Morgan Lovell Southern, says the best advice is to engage with employees early and often. “No one likes surprises,” he explains. “Most staff will be more likely to support change if they feel as though they have been part of the ideas and planning. We often facilitate workshops and brainstorming sessions with a cross-section of staff to listen to their ideas as well as open their eyes to fresh ideas, design and ways of working.” Sometimes, the move is a sign of a wider shift throughout the business, he adds. “In our experience, most organisations use the relocation as a catalyst to implement some changes to their image, culture, ways of working or structure.” However, where employees will be affected by a move, it is crucial for employers to bear their staff’s rights in mind. Some contracts will have mobility clauses that oblige the employee to move within certain reasonable limits, but not all do. To avoid compulsory redundancies, businesses should consider flexible ways of working, such as home working, to retain staff who can't make the move. For others, reaching a formal settlement will be necessary, and potentially expensive. When a man is tired of London, he is tired of poky offices, exorbitant rents and crippling business rates The time needed to relocate is another crucial consideration. “The larger the business, the longer it can take,” says Mr Allan. For an organisation of approximately 200 people, he says, “if we consider the entire process of finding a building, agreeing lease terms, appointing a design-and-build company to develop ideas, and then undertaking the fit-out, it will typically be about a year-long process.” As the potential time and costs add up, it makes sense to limit the management of the relocation to one or two responsible individuals, says Stephen McCue, who manages design and procurement at Surrey-based relocation services company Avant Contract Furnishings. Relocations are generally driven by economic considerations, and without good organisation and planning the many potential pitfalls could make a mockery of them. Mr McCue says that even furnishings can create large, unexpected costs, and it is not uncommon for relocated businesses to be caught out when they discover their office suite does not work in their new premises. “A lot of clients don’t dot all the ‘Is’ and cross all the ‘Ts’, he says. “They leave it until the last minute to think about relocating. They forget how much documentation they have and how much clearing out they need to do, which means they end up being surprised by the cost, and the timescale.” Connected Britain: key projects Infrastructure improvements that could boost your business • For more information on funding business growth, visit www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:58:41.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
