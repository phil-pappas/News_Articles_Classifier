Food and Wine Festival: Eat everything! \nTheme park reporter Dewayne Bevil sets out on a quest to try one of everything at Epcot's Food & Wine Festival. \nTheme park reporter Dewayne Bevil sets out on a quest to try one of everything at Epcot's Food & Wine Festival. Dewayne Bevil Contact Reporter Video: What if you ate everything at Food & Wine? \n\"There's nothing to eat,\" said no one ever attending the Epcot International Food & Wine Festival. The Walt Disney World annual event is loaded with edible options. \nUsually I recommend that visitors pace themselves, noshing only halfway around the World Showcase or putting their dining budget on a gift card and not dipping into cash reserves for another order. \nThis year I thought \"What if I ordered one of everything?\" and \"What would that cost me?\" \nAfter hitting every marketplace and recording the price of every food item (no drinks, please, I'm driving), I now have the answer ... which is revealed in the video above. Obviously, it's a bundle. Complete 2015 Epcot International Food & Wine Festival coverage Read more stories \nIn the process, I gathered some extremes. In the category of the most expensive entree at a national marketplace, it's a two-way tie between the New England lobster roll at American Adventure's Hops & Barley and Canada's wild mushroom beef filet mignon with truffle butter sauce. They both run $7.50 per plate. (You can also shell out $9.29 for fried chicken chunks with Dole pineapple sweet and sour sauce at Refreshment Port, which, judging by the menu is representing the island nation of Pineapplepia. This is where to buy Dole Whips.) \nOn the least-expensive side, look for the Guylian Belgian chocolate seashell truffles at the Desserts & Champagne marketplace for $1.75. Other small-budget options that aren't desserts include the sweet goat cheese panna cotta with guava gelle at Cheese Studio for $2.50, a fruit bowl (pineapple tidbits or mandarin slices) from Pineapplepia again for $2.25 and snack mix (nuts, fruits, crackers) from the Craft Beers area in the Odyssey Center for $1. \nThis year's festival runs daily through Nov. 16.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:48:26.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
