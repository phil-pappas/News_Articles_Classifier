During the conference, IAC attendees – which consisted of more than 275 senior leaders from many of ALHI’s Accounts, and General Managers and Senior Marketing Executives of ALHI’s worldwide Membership hotel and resort portfolio – raised $15,400 for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\nEach year at the conference, ALHI organizes a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) opportunity for attendees, with an ALHI match, for a selected charity. As September is National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month, and the IAC conference was conducted September 27-30, 2015, the designated charity was St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, in recognition of their outstanding work. Its mission is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Consistent with the vision of founder Danny Thomas, no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family’s ability to pay. Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing and food — because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.\nPictured are (from left): ALHI President Jim Schultenover and ALHI CEO David Gabri presenting the $15,400 check to Chad Buschell (second from right), Director, Atlantic Coast, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital; and Carolina Lizarralde, Associate Director, Atlantic Coast Regions – Miami, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\n“We are so pleased to give back to such a tremendous organization as St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital,” said Schultenover. “They have helped so many families over the past 50 years, and made such a positive impact on so many lives. We are very proud to present this donation, thanks to the generosity of our valued member hotels, resorts and clients.”\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center devoted solely to children. Treatments developed at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20 percent to 80 percent since the hospital opened more than 50 years ago.\nALHI’s Membership portfolio features more than 170 Four- and Five-Diamond quality hotels and resorts in North America that specifically focus on luxury meetings, incentive travel, conventions and expositions. ALHI also provides GSO “Alliance” services to the North American meetings and incentive marketplace for over 70 luxury hotels and resorts in Europe, the Middle East and Asia; a variety of 23 luxury-level cruise ships (Norwegian Cruise Line, Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Oceania Cruises) appropriate for M&I programs; and 55 Destination Management Companies (DMCs) in over 100 destinations worldwide with Global DMC Partners.\nFor information about any of ALHI’s Members and resources, planners should contact their nearest of the 20 professionally-staffed ALHI Global Sales offices situated coast-to-coast in the United States and in Canada, with locations in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Connecticut, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Kansas City, Louisville, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Richmond, Southern California (3), Toronto, Washington, D.C., and Washington (state).
