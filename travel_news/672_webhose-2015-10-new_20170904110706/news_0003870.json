More broadly, 85% will be created outside London and the South East.\n \nIn keeping with the geographical spread of new jobs anticipated in the manufacturing sector, 60% of the total economic benefit predicted by the Airports Commission as a result of expanding Heathrow will be generated outside of London and the South East.\n \n \nRange of net additional jobs in manufacturing in 2050 Proportion of total net additional manufacturing jobs in 2050 (%) Northern Powerhouse 26,200 – 26,400 28% Midlands 21,300 – 21,600 23% – 23% London and South East England 13,300 – 14,100 14% – 15% The South West 8,700 – 10,600 9% – 11% The East of England 8,400 – 8,700 9% Scotland 5,600 – 6,900 6% – 7% Wales 5,600 – 6,000 6% Northern Ireland 3,000 – 3,400 3% – 4% TOTAL 94,900 100% Table 1: Distribution of additional UK manufacturing jobs generated by Heathrow expansion in 2050, Quod October 2015 \n \nThe manufacturing sector would be one of the greatest benefactors of new jobs fuelled by a third runway at Heathrow, accounting for more than 50% of the 179,800 total predicted by the Airports Commission. As a trade-intensive industry, the sector is expected to benefit significantly from new and improved trade links, as well as from the ripple effect of Heathrow related growth across other sectors. Additionally, manufacturing is a key part of the aviation supply chain, and is likely to benefit directly as the sector increases purchasing.\n \nAn expanded Heathrow would be a significant boost for the industry, which is responsible for over half of all British exports. Last week, figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that manufacturing output in the UK remains 5.5 per cent below its level on the eve of the 2008 economic recession.\n \nRecent research by BIS and the Government Office for Science predicts that manufacturing in 2050 will look very different from today, and will be virtually unrecognisable from that of 30 years ago. It identifies the following key characteristics of future manufacturing:\n \nManufacturing will be more responsive and closer to customers – including a greater reliance on global markets. Patterns of global trade and investment will determine the relative importance of the countries to which the UK exports and from which it imports; High-tech is likely to remain an area of UK advantage – currently at 4.7%, the UK’s share of global high technology manufacturing exports is relatively strong. Current high-tech sectoral strengths include pharmaceuticals, aerospace, chemicals, and the automotive sector; There will be a greater reliance on higher-skilled workers as the sector moves away from elementary, process and heavy manufacturing and towards smaller more complex models.  \nJohn Holland-Kaye, Chief Executive of Heathrow Airport, commented: “Expanding Heathrow will supercharge Government plans for the Northern Powerhouse.\n \n“Today, airlines operating from the UK’s hub are forced to make a false choice between developing new routes to cities like Chengdu and Mexico City and maintaining domestic services. That means exporters in areas like Merseyside, Humberside and Teesside are locked out of Heathrow, Britain’s biggest port by value. Every day we delay is a day we’re restricting the growth of British business.\n \n“It is time for Government to heed the unanimous and unambiguous recommendation of the Airports Commission. It’s time to expand Heathrow for the whole of the UK.”\n \nTerry Scuoler, CEO of EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation, adds: “Heathrow is a global freight hub and a crucial gateway for Britain’s manufacturing exporters, making its expansion the right choice for industry and the country.\n \n“With the opportunity for growth and new jobs identified in this report, it reaffirms that it is important for the Government to make a clear choice and to press ahead with delivering this much-needed improvement to our national infrastructure.”\nSource:- Heathrow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:10:41.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
