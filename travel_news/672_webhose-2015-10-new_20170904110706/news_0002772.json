This was explained as part of a ritual for flight attendants that have flown 30 to 50 hours. The commercial air carrier has been identified as Kunming Airlines. \nA spokesperson for the airlines stated that the ritual, hazing or the bullying of the flight attendants only occurred when the aircraft was on the ground and no passengers were ever in danger during this demeaning practice. The spokesperson also claimed that there were no reports from any of the cabin crew members in their fleet ever complained about this bizarre and humiliating ritual. From reports on social media, this statement of no complaints is false. Many of the female flight attendants did file complaints, but the company decided to ignore their plea. Other flight attendants went along with this bullying tactic out of fear of being rejected by senior crew members.
