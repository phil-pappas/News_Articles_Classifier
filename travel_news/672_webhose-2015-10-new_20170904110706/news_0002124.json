Based in Exeter in the UK, Flybe is the largest independent regional airline in Europe, and the fourth airline to join ERA this year, bringing the number of carriers in ERA membership to 54.\nFlybe connects over seven million passengers a year across the UK and Europe on 149 routes serving nine countries from 62 departure points. Already operating more UK domestic flights than any other airline, Flybe intends to expand its branded, scheduled commercial operations by developing new routes and bases within the UK and exploiting potential in the wider regional European market through its connections to the world via long-haul hubs such as Manchester, Birmingham, Paris, Dublin and Amsterdam.\nCEO of Flybe, Saad Hammad, says: “Joining ERA will provide excellent networking and business opportunities and ensure that Flybe’s interests in areas such as EU 261 are represented at the highest levels in Europe.”\nDirector General of ERA, Simon McNamara, adds: “Flybe is a fantastic addition to ERA’s members and I am delighted to welcome them into membership. Flybe is a great example of a European regional airline. Its network provides excellent regional and European connectivity and it will be exciting to watch future developments at the airline. ERA is looking forward to working with Flybe and safeguarding its interests in Europe through our effective communication and lobbying campaigns.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:45:50.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
