It concerns a rather unusual discrimination case, which was brought by a company named Gerry Abrams against EAD Solicitors. It was unusual because, whereas discrimination claims are usually brought by employees, this one was brought by a company. Confused? Here are the bare bones. Gerry Abrams, the founder of the eponymous company and its employee, supplied services to EAD. When Mr Abrams reached EAD’s retirement age, he was told that the solicitors would no longer require his services because of his advanced years. Gerry Abrams, the company, took the case to an employment tribunal, saying that it was age discrimination. It won – and not only that, but it won the appeal at the beginning of October. What does this mean for your business? More bureaucracy, unfortunately This weird ruling could have some rather unfortunate repercussions for British businesses, as it means that companies, not just people, can bring these kinds of claims, opening the door for disgruntled suppliers to cry “Discrimination!” when a contract is cancelled or a pitch lost. The tribunal has effectively ruled that Section 13 of the Equality Act 2010 applies to corporate entities as well as human beings. “Right-thinking people might fall about laughing at the suggestion but the claim has succeeded,” David Whincup, head of the London employment department at commercial law firm Squire Patton Boggs. “This could be a real headache, in theory, as it means every decision you make to terminate or not enter into a contract with a business could potentially be challenged as discriminatory.” What does this mean for your business? More bureaucracy, unfortunately. It means that when you open a tender process, you or your head of procurement will have to keep detailed notes about why you chose company A over company B. The tribunal has effectively ruled that Section 13 of the Equality Act 2010 applies to corporate entities as well as human beings Mr Whincup says: “If I want to deal with a firm of lawyers and I have a beauty parade and one firm sends along some people to meet me who are disabled or from an ethnic minority, or pregnant, or very old or very young and I choose not to deal with that firm, even for competence reasons, that firm could in theory claim that it was because of the protected characteristics of those individuals.” The Government has been working to bring down the number of spurious claims that reach tribunal. In 2013, it brought in a new cost regime, requiring claimants to pay for the privilege. While the fee of up to £1,200 might deter individuals, it is unlikely to put off many companies, although there is still a possible penalty if a claim is found to be spurious. Are you likely to end up fighting a claim like this? Probably not. But there is a more insidious consequence to be aware of. “My concern is not that many cases will be brought but that they will be threatened,” says Mr Whincup. “People may find it easier to say, ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake, have £2,000 and go away’ rather than fight a case in the employment tribunal, which is lengthy and expensive.” He warns that this ruling could open the door to a corporate equivalent of the bad old days of discrimination abuse, when people applied for hundreds of jobs a day, making spurious claims in the hope that companies would pay out to make them go away. We will not know if similar discrimination claims are being made until April. Mr Whincup says: “I think that a company of any standing and reputation is going to need very strong evidence before it cheapens itself by bringing a claim of this sort. “It smacks of desperation, it’s embarrassing. But if I were a business without scruples which didn’t care about adverse PR, then why not?” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: Should small businesses borrow money to grow?
