From October until December 2015, each month will spotlight a different type of beef, including wagyu, aged beef, and beef and foie gras, in creative menus specially devised by Executive Chef Klaus Kallweit.\nUntil November 2015, discerning diners can delight in Wagyu Sensation, relishing succulent Australian wagyu, well known for its distinct marbling within the meat. With a high distribution of fat, wagyu is softer and more flavourful that other types of beef; however, as wagyu contains higher mono saturated fats, Omega-3 and Omega-6, the fat content is lower in cholesterol compared to other beef. Chef Klaus draws out wagyu’s flavours with several outstanding dishes, including braised wagyu cheek with whipped potatoes and wilted bay spinach; wagyu steak tartar with truffle croutons; and yakiniku-glazed wagyu burgers served with pickled courgettes.\nThis is followed by Aged Beef Delight, from November 3 to 30, 2015, highlighting aged beef, which is beef that is hung to dry for extended periods of time at controlled temperatures and rates of relative humidity. Chef Klaus leverages the intense, concentrated flavours that result from such treatment, characterised by an almost blue cheese-like note as well as truffle-like qualities, in mouth-watering signature dishes such as aged beef and chorizo skewers; aged beef and surf and turf; and roast prime rib and trimmings.\nThe promotion ends on a sophisticated and tantalising note, with Beef & Foie Gras. From December 1, 2015 until January 5, 2016, guests can savour culinary marvels such as beef carpaccio with shaved foie gras; beef rossini with truffle sauce; and wild mushroom risotto with seared beef and foie gras – all based on meat from angus (black) cattle, which is more subdued in taste to balance out the prominence of foie gras.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:54:31.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
