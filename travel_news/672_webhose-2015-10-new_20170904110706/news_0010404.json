These locations were added after last year’s move into Africa (Cape Town & Marrakesh) and Asia (Bangkok, Phuket & Pattaya, Thailand), as increasing numbers of golfers travel to long haul destinations to play in warmer conditions\nMadeira bound\nThe Dublin-based company founded in 2010 estimated that it will supply over 75,000 sets of golf clubs to European travellers this year – including those travelling to Madeira. The island south-west of Europe’s mainland joins Lisbon and Faro (the company’s first destination) as the list of Portuguese destinations grows even stronger. Golfers can pre-book sets online for Madeira at €50 per week from the 15th November and the clubs become available on 1st December.\n“Adding Madeira to our list of locations is tremendous news for us,” added Judge. “Portugal is a very popular destination for European golfers and we’re delighted that we can offer them something a little different in Madeira, where the Seve Ballesteros-designed Porto Santo course is one of the top attractions.”\nThe unrivalled ClubstoHire service is now available from one end of the Mediterranean to the other, with Madeira serving as the most western point through to Belek in Turkey to the east. Permanent shops can be found in airport terminal buildings at Faro and Malaga in Spain with sets from €35 per week.\n“Not only does the service offered by ClubstoHire.com save on potential airline excess luggage costs and the hassle of moving heavy golf travel bags to and from airport terminals, but it also provides golfers with the rare opportunity to trial the very latest clubs from the leading brands,” added Judge.\nLocations currently being served by ClubstoHire.com are: Spain – Alicante, Costa Dorada, Girona, Grand Canaria, Malaga, Murcia, Palma (Majorca) & Tenerife; Portugal – Faro, Lisbon & Madeira; Cyprus – Paphos; Morocco – Marrakesh; Turkey – Belek; South Africa – Cape Town; Dominican Republic – Punta Cana; Thailand – Bangkok, Pattaya & Phuket; United States – Las Vegas, Orlando & Scottsdale; UK & Ireland – Cork, Dublin, Edinburgh & Isle of Man.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:06:34.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
