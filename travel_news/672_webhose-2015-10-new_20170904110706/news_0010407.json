The play features original music and lyrics by Lord Graham Russell of Air Supply fame and a libretto by Sam Goldstein and Craig Clyde. \nBrothers Kurt, Mickey and Hans were born and raised in wartime Berlin, their parents perishing in the bombings of Berlin at the very end of the war. As the eldest, Hans took on the responsibility of raising his two younger siblings. Following the war he joined the East German border police and eventually became committed to the Communist cause. He is in a sense \"too old\" to be part of -- and appreciate -- the political movement of the 60's throughout the world and in Berlin. He views his job and the support he received from the Communist party as the reason he and his siblings survived. Mickey and his new wife Susanne, on the other hand, don't see it that way at all. As the story begins, Kurt is much more closely aligned with his brother Hans. He accepts that the Communist party is the path for him. Falling in love with Esther changes everything. Their love story covers 28 years. These three brothers are bound by blood and history but from the very start of the play are sharply divided by politics. Kurt's is an epic journey from blind certainty of his life path to questioning himself, his identity, and his choices but never his undying love for Esther. \nWhile still performing over 130 live shows each year with Air Supply on five continents, Lord Graham Russell is now dedicated to composing for the theatre, where he began his career starring in J esus Christ Superstar in 1975. This is Graham's third musical score and first project with Sam and Craig. Sam Goldstein has authored fifty books. He has served as Executive Producer and writer for a number of film projects including the award winning documentary Tough Times, Resilient Kids . A Wall Apart is his fifth writing collaboration with Craig and first with Graham. \nThe Acoustic Space is located at the Gateway (124 South 400 West | Salt Lake City, Utah 84101).
