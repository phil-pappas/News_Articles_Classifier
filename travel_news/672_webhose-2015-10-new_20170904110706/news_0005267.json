Marriott’s signature Mega Bonus promotion is back for the fall with targeted offers for customers that include double points beginning with your second stay, earn 2,000 bonus points per stay beginning with the second stay (up to 20,000 maximum), and earning a stash of points after completing a specified number of nights. \n7. If you’re in a bind and need more American Airlines miles, Marriott will give you a 20% bonus in miles for transferring points from Marriott to American Airlines.
