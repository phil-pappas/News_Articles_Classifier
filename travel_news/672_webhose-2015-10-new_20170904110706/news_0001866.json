Mexican authorities declared a state of emergency and all flights to and from popular tourist resorts Puerto Vallarta and Manzanillo were suspended and the cities' airports closed. The major cargo port of Manzanillo was also shut. \nHotel workers in Puerto Vallarta said efforts had begun to start evacuating guests, but others said they were still waiting to be told where to send them. 15,000 people are expected to be evacuated from Puerto Vallarta. \nHurricane Patricia is expected to make landfall on Friday afternoon or early evening. \nPresident Enrique Peña Nieto warned that the nation has never seen a hurricane this strong and promised special measures to provide protection.
