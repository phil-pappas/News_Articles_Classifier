After selling out of every item in stock during last year's Colorfest, Ready Aim Craft has expanded the variety and quantity of hand-made items they will be showcasing this year. For a second consecutive year, the shop anticipates being the sole vendor to feature artwork created from spent ammunition.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275660\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275661LOGO\n\"Last year's Colorfest was a much bigger success than we anticipated,\" recalled Janelle James , owner and curator of Ready Aim Craft. \"We were selling American flags before we could even hang them up to display. I was making the flags behind our booth in barely enough time to fill the empty spaces on our table.\"\nIn addition to the Shotgun Shell American Flag in three different sizes, the booth will be featuring Thin Blue Line art, the \" Don't Tread On Me \" Gadsden flag and smaller items such as key chains and flowers, all made from 12, 16 and 20 gauge shotgun shells. They will also be giving local buyers the opportunity to purchase any items that may have sold out, and have them made-to-order within two weeks.\n\"I think we provide a breath of fresh air to many of the attendees,\" says James. \"Not only are we the sole vendor selling items made from 12 gauge shotgun shells, but our entire shop encompasses the American spirit. We are a military family, providing items to our customers who want to show off their own patriotism, and everything we do surrounding our business is dedicated to promoting and preserving our Second Amendment rights.\"\nThe 52 nd Annual Catoctin Colorfest, located in at the base of the Catoctin Mountains in Thurmont, Md. , will take place on October 10 and 11, from 9am-5pm each day. Admission is free. For more information, visit: www.colorfest.org .\nAbout Ready Aim Craft\nReady Aim Craft is a craft shop comprised of various items celebrating American pride and patriotism.
