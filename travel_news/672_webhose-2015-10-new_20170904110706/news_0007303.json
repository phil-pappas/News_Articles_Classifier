Queues\n2. Price of food/drink/items\n3. How busy they are\n4. Hyperactive children\n5. How far apart everything is\n6. Waiting for baggage\n7. Priority boarders\n8. Rude staff\n9. Handing over boarding pass for purchases\n10. Strictness of procedures\nChris Clarkson, managing director of sunshine.co.uk, said:\n\"The airport experience needn't be a stressful one. If it's your outbound trip and you're starting off your holiday, stressing about everything isn't going to get your trip off to the best start. Plan ahead to avoid any stressful situations; leave the house early to get there in plenty of time, pay a little extra for priority boarding, check in online if you only have hand luggage and pack your own, security-friendly food and snacks to take.‚Äù", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BBT_online"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:05:18.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
