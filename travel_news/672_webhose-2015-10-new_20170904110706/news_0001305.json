W hotels has teamed up with the social media platform to launch its own set of filters to target the ever elusive millennial market. Playing on the traditional postcard format, guests staying at the hotel or even grabbing a quick cocktail can now share a shot of their location with a cheeky \"You Wish You Were Here\", \"Current Situation\" and \"Auto Reply: OOO\" emblazoned across it along with the brand's logo .You no longer need to be Jay-Z and Beyonc√© to get private access to the world's top tourist attractions. This year at the Adobe Max Conference in Los Angeles, the tech giant revealed a new camera app to delete tourists from photos. The app is named 'Monument Mode' and uses an algorithm to look at the scene and edit out things (or people) that are moving around a photo. This leaves the 'monument' that you want to take a photo of the centre of the photo. The new app will allow visitors to take full photos of key sights around the world even if moving tourists are standing in front of them. The app will certainly help holiday makers and photographers around the world to get the perfect shot. A demonstration of the app was given on stage at the conference this year and it only takes a few seconds for the tourist-free photo to be taken. Adobe has not yet given an indication as to when the app will be released.

London City Airport mainly used by business travellers might not have the fastest download speed but has factored in its target audience by ensuring no limits on its free wi-fi.Think that a bragging photo on social media of your boarding pass is harmless? Turns out it's not. Brian Kreb warned readers on his security blog this week that the two-dimensional barcodes contain a significant amount of information which people can use to unveil information about you. From a simple excited holiday snap of a boarding pass on social media, people have shown that they can reveal future travel plans, personal information and a frequent flyer account. So, a word of warning, think before you post a picture of your #boardingpass to ensure a trouble-free holiday! \nFriday, October 16, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:00:59.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
