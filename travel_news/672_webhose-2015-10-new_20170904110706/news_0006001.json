USA, 20 October 2015 -- It is well know that the materials applied to intelligent self-balancing scooters make or break one model of intelligent self-balancing scooter. In the market for electric scooter, the majority of electric self-balancing scooters adopt the Polycarbonate (PC) material in its shell and inner materials. Such Airwheel electric self-balancing scooters as the single-wheeled intelligent scooter X8 and the two-wheeled self-balancing scooter S3 also introduce that kind of PC material. However, the PC used in Airwheel scooter are more special and high-quality. This kind of special PC material is more durable and less subject to combustion and oxidation.Although the special PC material has so many advantages, it has as many disadvantages as its advantages. Each kind of PC material shares the same drawbackâ€”lacking of elasticity, subject to impression and break down. Therefore, it is imperative to find a brand new material to replace the previous PC material if Airwheel aspires to make another breakthrough once again in the whole sector of electric skateboards . Last month, Airwheel was proud to proclaim that it was successful in introducing a completely new material to its new product electric skateboard M3, which was rolled out in the second new product conference this year. The brand new material is Thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). TPU is short for this kind of new brand material Thermoplastic polyurethanes. Compared with the previous PC material, it is more elastic and less vulnerable to break down. The excellent elasticity of TPU makes the wireless remote control skateboard M3 abler to stand up to impact. Especially when the rider steers M3 on the bumpy path, TPU material is a big help to buffer the tossing to make sure a steady ride and enhance the enjoyment of ride. TPU material serves as a suspension device in a sense. It plays an important role in the process of ride. Additionally. This kind of material is more durable and less subject to oxidation with an obvious cut above PC material. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:36:36.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
