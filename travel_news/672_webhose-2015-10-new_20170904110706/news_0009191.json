Named after its location at 33 Royal Street in Disneyland's New Orleans Square, Club 33 serves a six-course tasting menu of French and New American food and is decorated with antiques chosen by Walt Disney and his wife. It's also the only Disneyland restaurant to serve alcohol. The restaurant and club officially opened in May 1967 after Walt Disney decided he needed a place to entertain visiting donors, dignitaries, celebrities, and politicians. Though he died five months before the club was completed, Disney would have loved the final product. There are a rumored 500 members on the roster and over 800 people on the waiting list hoping to be invited to pay a $25,000 joining fee and a $10,000-a-year membership fee . It's hard to get on the list, but every once in awhile, enough spots will open for Disney to send invitations to new members . Lucky for Doyle, he knew a family friend who was a member and offered to take him to the secretive restaurant for a second time. He shared the photos on his website DisneyDose.com as well as with Tech Insider.
