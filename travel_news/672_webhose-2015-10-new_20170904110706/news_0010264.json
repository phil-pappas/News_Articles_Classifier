The budget turnover is in conjunction with the re-orientation on Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998. Davao City alone received the P1.7M while the entire Davao Region benefits from a total of P68.6 million worth of agricultural projects turned over to respective Local Government Units (LGUs) via the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR). The budget boost is the government’s bid to further develop the farming and fishery industry in the region. In attendance during the event were fisher folk of Davao City, Panabo City in Davao del Norte and various towns in Davao Oriental. Cacao farmers were also in attendance during the budget turnover cum orientation. DA Secretary Proceso Alcala stressed the importance of open dialogue between the government and the industry stakeholders to discuss issues and provide resolutions. He further emphasized that the fisher folk and farmer’s active role in the BUB program is key in the industry’s development. Davao City has a booming fishing industry evidenced by commercial fishing resorts, fish pens and fishing restaurants like Campo Agua, Eden Nature Park Fishing Village and Felis Resort . Issues regarding farming and fishing such as farm to market roads, technical assistance, marine protected areas, irrigation, farmer’s markets and training for farmers were tackled during the event. Fishery and farming equipment such as fiber glass motorized boats, power sprayers, open source water pumps and hand tractors were also raffled off to lucky participants. It can be recalled that Davao City has just lifted its three-month commercial fishing ban in the Davao Gulf August 31st. The fishing ban is on its second year of implementation following a favorable outcome on its first run in 2014. The ban was implemented to allow small pelagic fishes to spawn and reproduce before the next open fishing season. BFAR has since observed that the fish caught in the gulf are considerably larger than before the ban was implemented.
