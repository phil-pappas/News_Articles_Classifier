Pets whose owners don’t care for them properly, farm animals reared in poor conditions and abandoned creatures whose eyes tell the story of the cruelty they have suffered at human hands. Founded by a group of philanthropists in 1824, and given royal patronage by Queen Victoria in 1840, the charity has one simple vision: to ensure all animals are respected and treated with compassion. That’s a bold ambition, and it is made manifest in a rich variety of ways. For example, investigating alleged cases of animal cruelty, prosecuting abusive owners, rescuing mistreated animals to find them loving homes as well as preventing suffering through education and advice. The charity also works to improve the wellbeing of wild and farm animals by offering expert advice and campaigning for legislation change. There’s not much that the RSPCA doesn’t do when it comes to protecting animals. Inevitably, that means the charity is reliant on the goodwill of its thousands of supporters, whose contributions fund every aspect of its work. “More than a half of our income comes from legacies,” explains one of the RSPCA’s legacy officers, Katherine Woolf. “This is where people leave money or gifts to the charity in their will. Quite simply, without their generosity, we wouldn’t be able to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome the thousands of animals that need us.” The charity is reliant on the goodwill of its thousands of supporters, whose contributions fund every aspect of its work That makes the work of the team Ms Woolf belongs to vital in securing the charity’s existence. “As a legal specialist, it’s part of my job to provide the information people need when they are considering leaving a gift, as well as to assist those administering a will,” she states. “That’s very satisfying, because I know just what we achieve when it comes to protecting animals across England and Wales.” Indeed, Ms Woolf has a constant reminder of the RSPCA’s good works, in the form of her very own rescue dog, a Staffordshire bull terrier cross called Grace. “A lot of staff take on rescue pets,” she reports. “The charity tends to attract animal lovers, so it’s hardly a surprise that our office is filled with dogs!” It's not just Grace that keeps Ms Woolf focused on her work, however. “It’s hard not to be moved when you read about some of the cruelty cases the charity deals with,” she says. “This keeps the legacy team firmly rooted in the RSPCA’s reason for being. We’re here to make life better for animals, and we work behind the scenes helping supporters fund the charity’s frontline activities.” And it’s these very frontline activities that ensure thousands of animals across England and Wales are rescued from awful conditions.
