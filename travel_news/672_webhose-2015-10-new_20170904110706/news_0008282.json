It is also a culinary delight having some first rate restaurants and classy tapas bars with prices that don’t break the bank. It has the added bonus of being close to some great beaches and coves.\nPerhaps it is not surprising that so many residents hail from elsewhere in Europe – they often arrived for a holiday but became so entranced with the place they moved in for good.\nAnd Majorca’s easy to reach too. We flew with easyJet from Southend airport in Essex but there are also flights from all over the UK. Around three hours after taking off we were tucking into tapas at the elegant Hotel Mirador.\nAnd the Mirador turned out to be a great choice.\nIt had a lot of old-world charm – it was decorated with marble floors and wood panelling and even boasted a series of interesting art installations. It also had a spa in the basement, complete with a sauna, steam-room, jacuzzi and 35ft plunge pool.\nSituated on the impressive harbour, the Mirador could hardly have been better placed for sightseeing. A short stroll past an assortment of yachts – some of which are particularly eye-catching – brings you to the fish market on the edge of the marina.\nNew fan: Aidan was quickly won over by Palma’s charms\nIn the corner up a solid, metal staircase you will find Ca n’Eduardo, one of the best fish restaurants you will find anywhere, and a fine sunset view over the harbour to the majestic spires of the cathedral.\nNext morning, on our way to that splendid cathedral we passed through the first of many cobbled squares, dominated by outstanding churches (tip: make sure you stop at RivaReno in the Placa de la Llotja for the creamiest of ice creams).\nA few mercifully shaded streets away – it was still 33C in September – found us at the cathedral.\nYou can hardly miss it. It dominates the city with its vast flying buttresses. Packed full of art treasures inside and restored early last century by world renowned architect Antoni Gaudi, it is one of Palma’s must sees.\nWith all that sightseeing we’d worked up an appetite, so what better than some traditional Spanish tapas? Serving up favourites with authentic style was Cafe Los Faroles on Carrer Morey, where we tucked into tortillas, croquettes and meatballs while sampling the sangria.\nRefreshed, we returned to ambling along the cobbled alleyways and found the Arab baths. Built in a similar style to Roman baths, they are a fascinating remnant of the 300 years when the Moors ruled here.\nClose by: You can find beautiful beaches within minutes of the city centre\nThat night we take a short taxi ride to Il Paradiso for dinner. True to its name, it is an extraordinarily beautiful restaurant, ornately decorated with an incomparable location. Perched on top of a cliff looking out over the bay of Palma, the dining room harks back to a more elegant age and on its circular balcony there are “romance” tables, where couples can enjoy the views.\nThe terrace is also open to the elements and with the sea, the sunset and a large glass of wine, it was hard not to feel in touch with the glamorous age of the 20s and 30s when the Hollywood greats made Palma fashionable and a world away from the young people behaving badly in nearby Magaluf.\nNext day we decided to see a bit more of the island. Renting a car is cheap and easy and we were soon heading to the east of the island, en route to Mondrago Natural Park.\nThe city soon gives way to pretty red stone walled fields and sleepy villages with shuttered windows and paved squares.\nWe stopped in the charming Ses Salines, about 45 minutes from Palma, which has taken its name from the nearby salt pans. They have been extracting salt here since Roman times.\nThe shallow basins of water glow lilac in the sun along the beach road to Platja des Trenc, a long spit of white sand, flanked by pine woods, which gently shelves into blue sea.\nShade: A narrow street near Temple Square in Palma\nAfter a dip in the warm water we took a stroll along the sand... but beat a hasty retreat when we realised we’ve strayed into the nudist end of the beach!\nWe hastily took another short drive, which brought us to one of the many beautiful coves. We stopped at Cala Llombards where the sea is a bright turquoise, framed by a rocky bay on either side and lapping on to a slab of white sand. It’s no wonder this place has been designated as an area of outstanding beauty.\nWe sipped iced lemonade at the beach bar and wondered how soon we would be able to return to the charms of this delightful island that had exceeded all expectations.\nOn our return flight the same stag party that was on our outbound flight was rather more subdued. Their experience of the island had probably been a little different than ours.\nBut that is part of the beauty of Palma and Majorca... there is still something for everyone.\nGet there EasyJet holidays has 7nts r/o at the 4* Hotel Mirador in Palma, Majorca, for £346pp inc flights from Southend on Apr 19 and based on 2 sharing.\nDepartures also available from a wide range of UK airports inc Manchester (£381), Bristol (£349), Liverpool (£350), Glasgow (£382), Gatwick (£331), Edinburgh (£393) and Newcastle (£378). easyjet.com/holidays 0203 499 5232.\nTourist info: spain.info\nTime zone: UK +1hr\nCurrency: Euro £1 = 1.33\nBest time to go: Try Majorcan magic next spring\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.spain.info/", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.easyjet.com/en/holidays/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-10-24T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:28:40.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
