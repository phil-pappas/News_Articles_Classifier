This change in direction looks to merge the effective operating models of other local and international festivals whilst maintaining its unique offering to the community through vibrant and diverse programming.\n \nLGBTIQ artists will be able to register their performances, works and endeavours for inclusion in the festivals program alongside major events that remain the mainstay of our program.\nFeast is currently in its 19th year of celebrating LGBTIQ diversity and inclusion. Feast’s inception was in 1997 where a group of cultural community workers created the Festival.\nPresently, Feast is a major event on the festival calendar and is one of the largest LGBTIQ Festivals in Australia and it has become an international event, bringing performers from all over the world and attracting visitors from near and far.\nThe Festival will be held from Nov 14-29, 2015 in Adelaide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:53:06.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
