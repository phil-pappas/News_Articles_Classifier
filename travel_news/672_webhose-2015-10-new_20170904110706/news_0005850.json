Return leg BA2272 will leave JFK at 2000 and land at Gatwick at 1000 the next day.\nBritish Airways MD at Gatwick, Lynne Embleton, said: \"The new route from Gatwick to New York’s JFK airport will enable us to offer access to a third London airport, giving our customers maximum choice and flexibility.\n“New York is British Airways’ flagship Atlantic route and will always be one of the most popular destinations for holidaymakers and business travellers alike. The flight will offer fantastic connections to our extensive network of short-haul flights to 112 destinations across Europe.\n“The new route also complements our almost hourly service from Heathrow, thanks to our transatlantic Joint Business with American Airlines. Customers can choose from 13 daily British Airways flights and another three on American Airlines to New York, as well as our double-daily business class only service from London City.”\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:21:36.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
