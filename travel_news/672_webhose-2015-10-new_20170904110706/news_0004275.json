With an initial inventory of over 125,000 hotels, visitors can already begin searching for properties around the world, while the Company continues to build those Central American-Caribbean properties, signing on with Oveedia, into its unique dual database system. Travelers can also 'register' with Oveedia to begin building their traveler profile.\nWith this initial version of the OTA however, the actual booking feature has been disabled, until the Company is completely satisfied with the stability and integrity of the platform. With heavy and consistent web traffic over the past 63 hours, yielding a bounce rate of 7%, and search sessions lasting in durations of as much as 45 minutes, the initial abnormalities affecting solely the first hour of the beta launch, is now a futile event. In fact, it is more so a testament as to why the Oveedia beta launch was an ultimate success for PURE .\nMr. Pereira continued, \"This is just the beginning. While the Oveedia beta launch was an ultimate success for PURE , we have lots of work ahead of us. But, it seems we are all up for the task. By 'we' I mean, the Company, Softon ITG , PURE's consultants and investors, and most importantly… the shareholders.\n\"Quite honestly, I am completely shocked, but pleasantly surprised, by the overwhelming support from our shareholders. So many of them have taken the launch of Oveedia just as serious as we do. We've received an incredible amount of feedback from people who have visited every page, have registered with Oveedia, and have tested the search engine capacities for close to an hour. Aside from the ' Booking' feature being disabled for the time being , the constructive criticisms have been more than helpful and are being considered for immediate or future implementation.\n\"This is what it takes to shape Oveedia ; user participation. Be it from travelers, shareholders, well-funded idiot bashers, naysayers, family, friends or OTA market enthusiasts, we need you, all of you, to continuously interact with and use Oveedia. This way, we can continuously improve the platform. With this joint effort, we will further prove that the Oveedia beta launch was an ultimate success for PURE , by quickly creating a significant amount of value and sustainable growth, something that each and every stakeholder will greatly benefit from.\"\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners.
