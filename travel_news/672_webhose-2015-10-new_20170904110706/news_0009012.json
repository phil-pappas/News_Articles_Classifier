Aficionados may also be aware that the movement was invented in Britain during the Fifties by Richard Hamilton, Eduardo Paolozzi and other members of the so-called Independent Group. Even the most knowledgeable connoisseur of Pop Art, though, would find Tate Modern’s autumn blockbuster, The World Goes Pop, a revelation. This is Pop Art, but as we never knew it before. The whole point of the exhibition is to move away from the familiar notion of Pop Art as principally an Anglo-American phenomenon. As a result, none of the over-exposed “greats” such as Andy Warhol or Roy Lichtenstein, get a look-in. Instead, the ingenious curators showcase little-known artists who, during the Sixties and Seventies, were working within the Pop idiom elsewhere in the world, from Brazil to Iran to Japan. Some of the work is patchy – not everything here is a masterpiece by any means. But the exhibition offers so many surprises and scintillating discoveries that, really, this doesn’t matter. Provocative, enterprising, original, fresh: this is exactly the kind of major show that the Tate should be putting on. Alastair Sooke is the author of Pop Art: A Colourful History (Viking) The World Goes Pop until 24 January at Tate, London.

Without Rebellion (1970) Polish artist Jerzy Ryszard “Jurry” Zielinski created this stylish yet unforgettably chilling work of art, in which a giant nail pierces a crimson tongue lolling out from the painting surface into the real world, in order to protest against censorship. Presented in the first gallery, it also “nails” the vehement political tone of the show as a whole.
