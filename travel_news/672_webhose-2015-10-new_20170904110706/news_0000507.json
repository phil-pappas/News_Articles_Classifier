When the machines were in use, lawmakers and travelers expressed concerns that the machines exposed travelers and TSA officers to too much radiation.\nThe Department of Homeland Security paid for the study because TSA is considering using updated versions of the X-ray machines, manufactured by American Science and Engineering Inc.\nThe TSA shelved the Rapiscan Secure 1000 machines in 2013 for privacy reasons. The machines created near-naked images of travelers while scanning for contraband hidden beneath clothing.\nTypical scans from a backscatter machine last 6 seconds. A scan would have to last 60 seconds to exceed the recommended radiation limit for a single dose, the scientists found. Even if the machine malfunctioned and focused the X-ray beam on a single location such as the lens of an eye, it wouldn’t damage the tissue, the report said.\n“Overall, the committee found that both the Rapiscan Secure 1000 and the AS&E SmartCheck X-ray backscatter systems complied with the applicable standard,” the report said.\nTSA deployed full-body scanners to reduce the number of pat-downs its agents had to do to passengers. The full-body scanners now deployed in airports use radio waves called millimeter-wave technology. The machines create cartoon images of travelers and suspicious items carried beneath clothing while searching for non-metallic weapons. Agents still pat down travelers if the machine detects something suspicious. Travelers can also decline to use the full-body scanners and opt for a pat-down search.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:59:43.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
