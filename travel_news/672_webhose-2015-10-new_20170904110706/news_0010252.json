Night Shyamalan's ' The Visit ' hitting the big screen, it's easy to feel like popular media is becoming increasingly age friendly . But today's films and TV shows are still filled with ageist stereotypes that are often harmful and demeaning. From being computer illiterate to making light of memory loss, we round up some of the most annoying stereotypes around. Hashtag? What's a hashtag? Special Agent Gibbs, a former Marine, asks: \"What's a hashtag?\" ...Really. Photo: NCIS Facebook Reports have shown that the older generation are becoming increasingly tech savvy. 36 per cent of retirees regularly use YouTube , 24 per cent use Skype, and a further 54 per cent are using Facebook regularly . 15 per cent use iTunes to download music, and one in ten opt for WhatsApp as their messaging platform of choice to stay in contact with friends and family. Over half of all retirees say they get their daily news intake from an electronical device and more and more are turning to online dating as opposed to more traditional methods of meeting people. It seems each week a new study or survey is revealed that shows the older generation are just as competent as the younger ones when it comes to technology. So maybe it's time for Hollywood to admit the \"old guy doesn't know what a computer is\" punchline is getting old? Mr/Mrs. I Have No Filter Sophia on The Golden Girls has her tactless and rude behaviour explained away by a stroke she suffered Photo: Reuters It seems like just about every TV show has a character like this. Whether it be Golden Girls ' Sophia Petrillo, who was blunt and tactless, Boston Legal 's Denny Crane, who was egotistical, sexist and mildly racist on top of being blunt and tactless, or even our very own Doctor , who has developed a particularly strong streak of bluntness since regenerating into Peter Capaldi , you don't have to look far to find this stereotype in the media. More often than not, these characters are allowed to utter rude, and often offensive, statements without any kind of repercussion and, while this trope can be humorous, when it's used so regularly it begins to wear a little thin. These characters seem to acts as if the expectations of society, and just plain politeness, stop applying to them once they reach as certain age and, as we all know, that's just not true. What's your name again? Grandpa Simpson is guilty of this particular trope Photo: YouTube While there are numerous conditions that can lead to memory loss in later life ( Alzheimer's , dementia , trauma, and more) it is, more often than not, played for laughs. The older character will often forget the names of their loved ones, or, like Abe Simpson above, do something ridiculous like confuse an iron with a phone. Not only are the serious conditions not taking seriously, they're also often grossly exaggerated and can sometimes be demeaning. In a review in the British Medical Journal , neuropsychologist Sallie Baxendale said that \"cinematic depictions of amnesia are consistently inaccurate and usually bear no relation whatsoever to any authentic neurological or psychiatric condition.\" Critics of the \"forgetful old person\" trope feel it occurs too often in popular media, especially considering memory loss problems affect around 40 per cent of people over 65 and for only 15 per cent does this develop into dementia. Grumpy Old Man Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau star in Grumpy Old Men Photo: Rex Also known as \"Mr/Mrs. Back in my day...\", this character spends an inordinate amount of time complaining about how the world is going to pot and how today's youth show no respect and how everything was so much better when they were young. This character is a killjoy, depressing, boring, and paints the older generation in a negative light. Research has founds that negative stereotypes, such as portraying them as bitter and cantankerous , can have an adverse effect on older people. Earlier this year, a study in the American Psychological Associationâ€™s journal found that older adults are negatively affected in situations that remind them of, and reinforce, negative age stereotypes. Did I ever tell you about the time I... Professor Farnsworth in Futurama is a repeat offender Photo: YouTube Chances are, when an older character appears on your TV screen , they're snoring - or mid conversation and about to fall asleep. This phenomenon of older people falling asleep halfway through a conversation or when something important is about to happen could be linked to narcolepsy, but most of the time, it's just played for laughs. Like with the 'Grumpy Old Man' trope, having older characters fall asleep all the time helps to reinforce negative stereotypes and besides, research shows that the over 50s are more fitter and active than ever, so it's really not even that accurate. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:25:51.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
