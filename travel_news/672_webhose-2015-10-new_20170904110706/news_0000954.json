(Photo: Royal Caribbean) \nJust how far along is the construction of the largest cruise ship ever ? See for yourself with a scroll through the carousel above, which offers the latest images of Royal Caribbean’s soon-to-debut Harmony of the Seas as it comes together at France’s STX shipyard. \nScheduled to debut in April, the third vessel in Royal Caribbean’s celebrated Oasis class series will measure 227,000 tons, eclipsing its two record-size sisters by more than 1,700 tons. \nTowering 16 decks above the ocean, Harmony of the Seas will hold a record 5,479 passengers at double occupancy, nearly 100 more than the two earlier Oasis class vessels. USA TODAY Our guide to the hottest new cruise ships on order \nThe first two Oasis class ships, Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas, made waves in the cruise industry when they debuted in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and are by far the largest cruise vessels currently afloat. Chock full of dozens of eateries, bars, showrooms and deck-top fun zones, they each measure 225,282 tons and carry 5,400 passengers at double occupancy. \nHarmony of the Seas will have several new features for an Oasis class ship including giant, multi-deck water slides and a “bionic bar” where the drinks are served by robot bartenders — a concept that first debuted in 2014 on Royal Caribbean’s new Quantum of the Seas. \nLike Oasis and Allure, Harmony will be built around seven distinct neighborhoods: Central Park, Boardwalk, the Royal Promenade, the Pool and Sports Zone, Vitality at Sea Spa and Fitness Center, Entertainment Place and Youth Zone. \nUSA TODAY Cruise in April was among a handful of U.S. media outlets to get early access to Royal Caribbean’s last new vessel, Anthem of the Seas, ahead of its christening in Southampton, England.
