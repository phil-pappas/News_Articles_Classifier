The opening follows an extensive renovation and refurbishment of The Danum Hotel, which has occupied Doncaster’s High Street since 1809. The much loved local hotel is now aligned with Mercure, an international brand managed by Accorhotels. \nSituated in the town centre and a short walk from the rail station, the Mercure Doncaster Centre Danum Hotel is a plush base from which guests can explore Doncaster, with its Norman castles, Regency buildings and rich horse racing heritage, as well as great shopping and nightlife. The hotel’s 62 bedrooms offer a mix of the modern and the traditional, with each boasting exquisite décor, Hypnos beds and LCD TVs. The hotel will also offer 15 privilege rooms and two luxurious suites. The reception space has been luxuriously refurbished to create a contemporary open lobby. Two reception pods will accommodate quick and hassle-free check in and check-out, demonstrating the Mercure brand’s continued commitment to putting the customer’s welcome experience at its heart. Jonathan Sheard, SVP Operations Luxury, Upscale and Midscale Hotels, Accorhotels UK and Ireland commented, “This hotel is a really iconic hotel in Doncaster and we are very excited for it to be opening as a Mercure branded property. It celebrates everything which is exceptional about Mercure with a building that is in itself in harmony with the people and place. The refurbishment is stunning – we can’t wait for people to see it.” Anthony’s Bar & Restaurant The transformation includes the opening of Anthony’s Bar & Restaurant, named after Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Ledger, founder of the St Leger Stakes horse race, which is held annually at Doncaster Racecourse. A cosy and contemporary eatery wrapping around the ground floor of the hotel, diners can expect local, seasonal produce, including the fresh ingredients that Yorkshire is renowned for. Quirky design features include equestrian themed artwork, colourful rosettes and jockey whips, in a scheme inspired by the racecourse itself. Anthony’s puts local sourcing first with all meats sourced from butchers and farmers in the area, proudly displaying the Yorkshire roots. Dishes include classics such as Steak and Ale Pie, Deep Fried Haddock and Konisburgh Sausages to Gourmet burgers, panini’s and salads for lighter bites. Desserts of sticky toffee pudding and Chocolate Fudge cake round off the delicious menu. Anthony’s restaurant offers all day dining from 7am until 9:30pm and is also open to non-hotel guests. Corporate events and facilities The newly refurbished Victorian Ballroom with its high ceilings, large bay windows and beautiful chandeliers is available for large scale events, accommodating up to 350 and is a must see following the refurbishment. The hotel also boasts seven modern meeting rooms with air-conditioning, free WIFI, LED projectors and natural daylight with configurations which can hold from 100 delegates to more intimate settings for just ten people. The Mercure Doncaster Centre Danum Hotel opened its doors yesterday (29th September). Bedrooms start from £69 per night.
