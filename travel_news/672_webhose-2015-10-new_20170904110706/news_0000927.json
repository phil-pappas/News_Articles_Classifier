In particular, the addition will make it easier for travelers with disabilities who will no longer have to go back out through security for their service animals to use the existing outdoor pet facilities. The pet relief room is located past security checkpoints in the rotunda area of Terminal 3. Pop-up sprinklers wash away liquid waste into a drain, and plastic bags are available for cleanup.
