The International Commission on Radiological Protection sets radiation guidelines for human health, recommending dose limits of 20,000 microsieverts per year, averaged over five years (so 100,000 microsieverts in five years) for radiation workers, and 1,000 microsieverts per year for the general public.\nMost of us — even pretty frequent fliers — don't get anywhere near those limits. You get about 40 microsieverts of radiation on a flight from Los Angeles to New York, so you'd need to hop on about 25 such flights a year to hit the limit for the public.\nAs you can see, there's no need to worry about airport screening — that exposure is super minimal, and even the health risk for frequent fliers is considered very small.\nTo learn more, see our story on the\nhealth risks of frequent flying .\nGo to MSN Home This feature is not supported on the version of your browser.
