These group tours, designed exclusively for the age group of 18-35, are low-cost alternatives to the packages offered, with itineraries almost similar except for the inclusion of budget accommodation facilities in lieu of premium ones.\n“We have spent the last few months taking a look at what an ideal travel experience for our guests could be and found that we could make many changes to improve the packages and make them experiences of a lifetime, for them. The success of a series of new group tours launched this time last year, all of which gave us great response in terms of customer satisfaction, is the reason to renew our style. All our new packages have been tailor-made and existing itineraries revamped, keeping in mind the ultimate tourism experience for the guests,” says Anish Kumar, CEO of The Travel Planners.\nThe Travel Planners is a recipient of the ‘Best Tour Operator’ Award from the Ministry of Tourism Government of India, and various other recognition's. The company has offices in Trivandrum, Cochin, and Canada. The Travel Planners also owns two boutique resorts in Kerala- SpiceTree Resort, Munnar and The Villa Romantica, Cochin.\nFind out more about The Travel Planners and their great tour packages at http://www.keralatourpackages.com/index.php .", "external_links": ["http://www.keralatourpackages.com/kerala_cultural_tour/", "http://www.keralatourpackages.com/index.php", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXJhbGF0b3VycGFja2FnZXMuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocA==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXJhbGF0b3VycGFja2FnZXMuY29tL3NvdXRoX2luZGlhX3RvdXIv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXJhbGF0b3VycGFja2FnZXMuY29tL2tlcmFsYV9jdWx0dXJhbF90b3VyLw==", "http://www.keralatourpackages.com/south_india_tour/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:13:25.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
