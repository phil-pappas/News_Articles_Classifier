They have a huge amount of experience in the aeronautical industry and I think as the technology advances with America’s Cup sailing you are relying on other industries to help us to develop at the highest possible level.”\nAs part of this partnership, Airbus’ knowledge in fields such as aerodynamics, instrumentation, simulation, composites, structures, hydraulics and data analysis will be acquired by SoftBank Team Japan as they design their future race yacht.\n“Making sure all the boat’s systems work at the highest possible level will be very important in these new boats,” said Barker and will boost the team’s competitiveness and design efforts considering the limited time the team has been together, having announced their challenge only in April 2015. Airbus’ expertise is invaluable.”\nAirbus is a leading aircraft manufacturer offering a complete range of aircraft families, from 100 to well over 500 passenger seats, as well as the most modern, comprehensive and fuel-efficient product line on the market.\nSoftBank Team Japan, supported by Kansai Yacht Club, is the Japanese challenger for the 2017 America’s Cup. Dubbed the “oldest trophy in international sport”, the America’s Cup is the pinnacle event in sail racing founded in 1851. SoftBank Team Japan is the first Japanese flagged team to challenge for the trophy since 2000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:10:11.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
