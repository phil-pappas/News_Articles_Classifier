Down they go. Source: Supplied \nNew Zealand’s Department of Conservation operations manager Mike Slater told the NZ Herald: “As a result (of the cable release) that has upset the stability of the bridge and that’s where people that were on the bridge have slipped off and fallen. \n“Fortunately other than some scratches and a little bit of bruising, they are not seriously injured.” \nHe said the incident is being investigated. \n“An event such as this is extremely rare occurrence and we just need to understand in this particular case exactly what did happen.” \nMr Slater said the bridge was last inspected in September last year, and had a full inspection 18 months ago by an engineer. Looking up at the bridge.

Our reputation cannot rely on luck. \n“The cable failure is not only extremely concerning, it leaves New Zealand vulnerable to harmful tourism reaction.” \nThe bridge was closed following the incident. \nnews.com.au has contacted the Department of Conservation for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:57:22.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
