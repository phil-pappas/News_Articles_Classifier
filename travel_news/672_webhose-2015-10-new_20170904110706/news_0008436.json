Darren Poultney, CEO of Smart AV and IPG, says: “The September results really reflect a trend we’ve seen emerging recently, where high-resolution rental LED is in demand not just for exhibition stands but also for digital conference sets, creative pop ups, sporting events, retail spaces and more permanent installations. “We recently made a big investment in our LED stock which has allowed us to fulfill demand and ensure we can cater for such a large number of events simultaneously. Owning such a large fleet also allows us to be flexible - we can turn jobs around extremely quickly and are able to adapt to the changing needs within the industry.” The announcement comes following recent investments in LED technology at Smart AV, including an expansion of the 3.9mm fleet, with the addition of 3.9mm smart-edge LED for right-angled and creative cube designs. The 5.9mm indoor and outdoor curved LED has also been added to the roster, allowing an increased level of creativity and greater flexibility in stand design. IPG looks set to continue its momentum throughout the remainder of 2015, with an imminent investment in the exceptionally high-resolution 2.5mm LED technology (the lowest pixel pitch available for rental). Key shows confirmed include the Dubai Airshow, World Travel Market, MAPIC and the British Dental Industry Association showcase.
