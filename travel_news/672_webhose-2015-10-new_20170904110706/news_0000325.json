A 24-carat gold facial, cryotherapy chambers and a snow room... 'Moongate' entrances and stunning views of Canada's most... I arrived on a Saturday afternoon, with the hotel proving to be an immediate sanctuary from nearby Portobello Road Market and its tourist overload.\nSetting foot in Room 16 is like taking a trip through time - not just because of its famous tales.\nThe bright room is decorated with antique fixtures and dark wood furniture, oversized oval mirrors, and a lovely peach-coloured loveseat, with a floral design, that you might find in someone’s gran’s house.\nOpen since 1971, The Portobello Hotel is set in two converted neo-classical mansions, and its 21 rooms feature individual designs\nDespite its celebrity clientele, The Portobello Hotel is very laid back and not pretentious, and is set on a very quiet residential street\nNestled on a quiet street in Notting Hill,\nBut the room’s best features are its big three - the Victorian claw-foot bathtub with several nozzles that took a few minutes to master before a deep soak, an 8ft circular bed with curtains, and floor-to-ceiling bay windows overlooking a private garden guests don’t have access to.\nA giant antique wardrobe near the door hides a mini bar, wash basin, kettle and Nespresso machine.\nThe cheerful room has its quirks and some details, such as the carpet and a noisy sink in the bathroom, could use an upgrade.\nDespite its celebrity clientele, The Portobello Hotel is very laid back and not pretentious.\nOpen since 1971, the hotel is set in two converted neo-classical mansions, and its 21 rooms feature individual designs.\nWhile it may not attract as many big names as it used to (the hotel appeared to be filled mostly with foreign tourists during my stay), it still manages to draw celebrities (a famous actor was sitting down for breakfast with his wife as I checked out).\nThe Portobello Hotel has five room categories - single, good, better, great (pictured, with a four poster bed) and exceptional\nBetter rooms, like this one, have a king-sized bed and an intimate feel with pitched ceilings, open baths and separate showers\nIn The Portobello Hotel's sitting room, guests can pour their favourite tipple at an honesty bar, or enjoy a continental breakfast\nThe boutique hotel is nestled on a quiet residential street, with the only marker being its name inscribed on the glass of its front door\nGiven its small footprint, the hotel doesn’t have its own restaurant, although there is a complimentary breakfast in the large sitting room, with offerings such as croissants, cheese, prosciutto, cereals, yoghurt and fruit juices.\nA cooked breakfast menu, with everything from a couple of eggs to a full English, is available for an additional charge.\nWhen breakfast isn’t being served, the sitting room, which probably has some stories of its own, boasts a well-stocked honesty bar with a light snack menu.\nThe walls inside Room 16 may not tell any tales about my stay, but it was far from dull.\nAnd while I may not lead a thrilling life like a celebrity, I certainly can clean up like one.\nTRAVEL FACTS Standard rooms at The Portobello Hotel cost from an average of £195 a night.
