But having done so, I still came back to Wales’ extraordinary defeat of England at Twickenham. It was nowhere near the shock of Japan beating South Africa in the first round of games but, given the injuries Wales sustained before and during the match, it was a remarkable away win, demonstrating hwyl aplenty. For the first 50 minutes England were the better side and could, possibly should, have put Wales away during that period. On the charge: Dan Lydiate, right, tackled himself to a standstill Photo: Getty Notable displays in a rearguard and resolute defence came from Alun Wyn Jones and flanker Dan Lydiate, who tackled himself to a standstill. Toby Faletau and captain Sam Warburton scrapped furiously around the breakdown, even though for large parts of the game they were on the back foot. The Wales half-backs had a big part in keeping their team within touching distance as they fought for territory constantly, so giving England minimal try-scoring chances. Dan Biggar, in particular, was shrewd with his kicking from hand, and his flawless penalty kicking repeatedly reduced England’s lead. His tricky kick from the right-hand side to cut Wales’s deficit to 22–18 was a hugely important score. Game changer: a Gareth Davies try helped to decide the outcome Photo: Getty Biggar, along with Gareth Davies, was also responsible for recognising the point at which the momentum of the game changed and taking advantage of the opportunity this presented. It is one thing seeing what has happened, it is another executing the right solution. This they did by altering the focus of attack from narrow to wide, turning the game upside down. I was tempted to give Davies the hero award as he scored the sensational try that stunned England but, in the end, Biggar takes it for his seminal tactical and points-scoring efforts.
