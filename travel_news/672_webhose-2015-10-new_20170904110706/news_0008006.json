But to Peregrine Cavendish, who climbed trees in the park as a boy and became the 12th Duke of Devonshire on the death of his father 11 years ago, it’s the heady mix of heritage and modernity that continues to entice more than a million visitors each year to the house and grounds, currently managed by a staff of 700. “We may have a 405-hectare park packed with rare tree species surrounding our family home, but at least some of the plants and flowers in the formal gardens are everyday species like dahlias and rhododendrons, which visitors may well have at home,” comments the duke, adding: “It’s really only a matter of scale.” If emerald ash borer is added to the equation, I don’t like to think how the landscape will change Well, up to a point. That celebrated landscape artists including Capability Brown and Sir Joseph Paxton have toiled in the duke’s back garden, and not mine, suggests a pretty grand scale, as he smilingly agrees. But some 45 years since Dutch elm disease destroyed more than 25 million UK trees, the issue of disease unifies all, he believes. From the larch-killing Phytophthora ramorum or Dothistroma needle blight, which attacks native Scots pine for example, to acute oak decline, ash dieback and a virulent bleeding canker which targets horse chestnut, Chatsworth’s treescape is now under sustained attack. The duke believes that between 10pc and 20pc of the estate’s tree population – 4,000 in the park alone – will need to be replaced as a direct result of pests and pathogens. However, despite his particular sadness at the loss of around one-third of the estate’s cedar trees, some of them at least 250 years old, he remains sanguine. “We have to accept that disease is now a part of life for anyone who loves and reveres trees, and in my view it’s only by adopting a policy of species diversity that we can bring it under control,” he says. While he chastises the government for failing to stem the import of plant material from overseas, which is at “crazy levels”, the duke believes that apportioning blame for the sustained attack on our indigenous tree population is pointless. “Many of the current diseases attacking our trees are wind-borne, so it isn’t simply a case of walkers and dog owners bringing them onto the land on their boots,” he says. “Nobody wants to see the countryside closed down to the public again, as it was with foot-and-mouth, so unless we are going to start demanding that all our visitors disinfect their footwear, we are going to have to survive this nasty outbreak of tree disease without basic bio-security.” In common with other arboriculturalists – “better that than a tree-hugger”, he says with a shudder – the duke believes that in replacing diseased trees, landowners need to take a broad-brush approach. “If you’re talking about new planting in the Peak District, should you be looking at species which are indigenous to Derbyshire, to England, to the UK or to Continental Europe?,” he asks. “It seems to me we should be looking at a far wider palette as we set about replacing the familiar trees we have now lost. We need to imagine a different, not inferior landscape for the future.” In the coming months, the duke’s forest rangers will plant eight or more large elm saplings, which have proved to be peculiarly resistant to the scourge of Dutch elm disease. They were propagated in a nursery in Rayne, Essex. The prospect of seeing one of the country’s most majestic trees back in force in the park brings a beam to the 71-year-old duke’s face. For his own part, the Duke of Devonshire’s favourite tree at Chatsworth is a Quercus rubra , a single oak of indeterminate age that stands in the heart of the park and turns red for just a few short weeks in autumn. He notes, almost with surprise, that many people admire the rich hues of copper beech; yet he believes that green is a colour which no true tree-lover could ever tire of. “I’m immensely proud of the many ancient and venerable oaks that have been standing here for perhaps more than 1,000 years, but I approve of experimentation, too,” says the duke. While the duke says that genetically modified trees could prove an important weapon against tree disease for the future, he fears that the threat posed to the entire Peak District by ash dieback is already unavoidable. We should be looking at a far wider palette as we replace the trees we have now lost “If it’s true that up to 75pc of ash trees will go in affected areas, the effect on the microclimate for flora and fauna will be disastrous, but sadly, it’s too late to do anything to prevent it from spreading,” the duke explains. “If emerald ash borer [a North American pest which is now making its way westwards across Europe from an outbreak near Moscow] is added to the equation, I don’t like to think how the local landscape will change.” Unfailingly polite and courteous, the duke becomes almost raucous when the thorny subject of woodland animals comes up. “Please don’t mention grey squirrels to me and, yes, now you ask, rabbits can be just as bad,” he says. “I realise that many of our visitors like these creatures, but we need to educate them about the serious damage they do to our newly planted saplings, as well as why it is necessary to cut down heavily diseased trees and trees that just happen to be in the wrong place.” Education, education, education. The man born to be the figurehead of Chatsworth House finds that teaching the rest of us about the country’s woodland is one of the most important jobs of all. What the Woodland Trust says It is devastating to consider the scale of the loss that is likely to affect the duke’s estate as a result of tree disease. Unfortunately, this is likely to be replicated across the UK, as trees both inside and outside woods become infected. Ash and oak are the most common roadside and hedgerow trees, and any loss of these presents a significant risk to wildlife species, including pollinating insects, that use these trees as habitat and ‘corridors’ to move through the landscape. The duke’s approach of developing a broader mix of tree species is a key element in creating a more resilient landscape. Within woodland, natural regeneration is often possible, with protection from grazing damage by animals such as deer and squirrels, allowing saplings to grow. However, where one species dominates, introducing a mix of species may help, and native tree species are best for woodland wildlife. Outside woodland, planting is essential to replace trees lost to disease. We have a variety of less common native trees to choose from in the UK, including wild service, whitebeam, lime, wild cherry, alder and hornbeam. We urgently need the support of landowners across the country to encourage a greater diversity of native trees. Prompt action in planting and protecting trees will help provide continuity for woodland species that depend on trees of certain age or condition. When planting, it is vital to check that the trees are both sourced and grown within the UK to minimise the risk of introducing new diseases. The Woodland Trust works with nurseries that provide only UK-sourced and grown trees for planting. – Christine Reid, head of conservation, the Woodland Trust You may also be interested in: • A helpful guide to recognising tree disease • What is being done to combat tree disease? • The impact of tree disease on British woods", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:49:11.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
