Go on a ghost tour \nMaybe your local theatre is haunted. Or perhaps your favourite restaurant used to be a morgue. Ghost tours are the perfect way to scare yourself silly while also learning interesting facts about the history of your city. \n4. Sleep aboard a pirate ship \nIf ghosts aren't really your thing, consider spending a night aboard a pirate ship. GetMyBoat , known as the Airbnb for boats, offers a variety of options that will get you feeling like Captain Jack Sparrow in no time. \n3. Celebrate Day of the Dead \nThis Mexican holiday is gaining popularity. While it traditionally commemorates friends and family who have died, it's also an opportunity to paint your face like a sugar skull and knock back the sangria. \n2. Dress up \nIt's not just for kids. Whether it be your favourite movie character, a political figure, or a faithful old witch, get into costume and head to a Halloween party. \n1. Watch a scary movie \nMany cinemas play classic, cringeworthy slashers at Halloween. Head along for a scream on the big screen. Or get yourself some microwave popcorn and watch at home. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:25:36.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
