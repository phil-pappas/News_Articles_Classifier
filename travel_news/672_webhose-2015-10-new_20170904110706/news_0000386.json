Due to begin welcoming guests in 2018, the grand two-tower Rosemont Hotel and Residences, a 450-guestroom and 280-serviced apartment property, which will be developed on Dubai’s Sheikh Zayed Road, will offer travellers local discoveries and authentic travel experiences indicative of the Curio brand.\nLaunched in June 2014, the Curio collection is a global set of remarkable upscale and luxury hotels hand-picked for their unique character and personality; each one a part of the city they call home. By partnering with Hilton, these one-of-a-kind hotels benefit from the proven track record and quality synonymous with Hilton without redefining the individualistic spirit of the hotel. Curio has already welcomed guests at its first properties in the Americas including Las Vegas and Buenos Aires and in Europe with the recently opened iconic Reichshof Hamburg Hotel. The Rosemont Hotel and Residences adds to the brand’s growing global portfolio with entry into the Middle East, which will also see Curio – A Collection by Hilton Mall of Qatar open in 2016.\nRudi Jagersbacher, president, Middle East and Africa for Hilton Worldwide, said, “Dubai’s vibrant hospitality sector continues to grow at an impressive pace, firmly earning its position as a highly desirable destination for global travellers. We continue to see huge potential in the market, and to add a Curio property to our portfolio of 35 hotels either trading or under development in the UAE is our global recognition of the Emirates’ unique ability to further build a compelling and cultured offering to attract visitors from around the world.”\nIn line with the ethos of the brand, the UAE’s first Curio hotel will aim to capture the personality of the local urban landscape with its offering designed to reflect the needs of travellers to Dubai. Owned by Royal International and managed by Hilton Worldwide, The Rosemont Hotel and Residences will enjoy a prime location, opposite Dubai Internet City, providing guests with easy access to key business districts and top tourist attractions including Mall of the Emirates and Jumeirah Beach. Catering to Dubai’s thriving business landscape, four meeting rooms, two boardrooms and one multi-functional space will host small and large-scale meetings, conferences and events.\nThe hotel will also offer guests a number of stylish food and beverage outlets; which will include three restaurants, a lobby café and two bars. Guests will have access to a fully equipped gym, an outdoor pool and a spa, where they can indulge in luxurious treatments.\nDianna Vaughan, global head, Curio – A Collection by Hilton, said, “Since launching Curio in 2014, we have received an influx of interest from owners in the Middle East seeking to create a unique hotel experience underpinned by the reassurance of Hilton. The Rosemont Hotel & Residences is a perfect match for our collection, and we are delighted to count Dubai as a destination for our rapidly growing global set of distinctive hotels.”\nAs part of the Hilton Worldwide portfolio, Curio – A Collection by Hilton participates in Hilton HHonors®, the 45 million member, award-winning guest loyalty program for Hilton Worldwide’s twelve distinct hotel brands. Hilton HHonors members always get the lowest price with Hilton’s Best Price Guarantee, along with HHonors Points, free Wi-Fi, access to digital check-in and Digital Key, and no hidden fees only, when they book directly through Hilton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:38:47.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
