The former General Manager of Mövenpick Ibn Battuta Gate Hotel Dubai is now set to attract new markets for the company’s properties in Jordan.\nIn 2014, Jordan received the “Destination of the Year” medical travel award from the International Medical Travel Journal, and was named the “Best Overall Destination” for its success in handling 250,000 international patients.\nNugent, who is originally from Ireland, has more than 35 years of experience in the hospitality industry, having worked for 20 years in the region at Le Méridien and Mövenpick hotels in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. His journey with Mövenpick spans nine years, during which he served as general manager of Mövenpick Hotel & Apartments Bur Dubai and Mövenpick Hotel Deira, where he led the pre-opening team.\nCommenting on his new role, Nugent said, “Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts in Jordan plays a unique role in the region, especially as there are several destinations for international guests that place an emphasis on their well being and health. Unique natural resources like the Dead Sea for example, where we operate one of our award-winning properties, have contributed to the country’s growing medical sector.”\nNugent added that the Medical Centre at Mövenpick Resort & Spa Dead Sea is open for clients from the GCC and Europe, who come for therapeutic and medicinal benefits available only at the Dead Sea.\nTo the new regional director, healthcare is a personal cause too. This year, he ran Michael’s Virgin London Marathon 2015 to raise funds for Crohn’s disease.\nMövenpick has five award-winning properties in Jordan, strategically located near major holiday destinations, including Petra, the Dead Sea, Aqaba and the Red Sea resort of Tala Bay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:52:16.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
