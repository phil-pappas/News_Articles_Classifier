We’ve defended all our country’s most sensitive issues,” said Chilean Foreign Minister Heraldo Muñoz.\nConcretely, Fast said, the deal will result in significant reductions of bureaucratic and tariff barriers to trade and investment among the 12 countries.\n“Red tape is consuming so much world activity, … this is a massive achievement in reducing that red tape,” he said. TPP “is going to lead to far more seamless trade.”\nA file photo taken on Nov. 10, 2014 shows U.S. President Barack Obama taking part in a meeting with leaders from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.\nMandel Ngan/AFP\nRatification challenge The accord still must be signed and ratified by the respective countries. But that could be a challenge in a number of countries.\nMany of the details of the deal were negotiated in deep secret, drawing persistent criticism that business interests dominated the talks and that the public interest in many countries was being thrown aside.\nOnce made public, the details of the TPP could spur a backlash, especially in Canada, facing a national election in two weeks, and in the United States, with elections coming in one year.\nU.S. members of Congress have already warned that they will not ratify any deal that gives up too much in U.S. interests.\nPowerful U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch warned Monday that he will scour the deal “to determine whether our trade negotiators have diligently followed the law so that this trade agreement meets Congress’s criteria and increases opportunity for American businesses and workers.”\nRead more free trade stories here", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/business/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-is-reached.html?_r=0", "https://ustr.gov/tpp/"], "published": "2015-10-06T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:30:23.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
