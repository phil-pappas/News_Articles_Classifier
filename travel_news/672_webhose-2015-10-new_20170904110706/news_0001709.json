But in five minutes it will lead you to a miniature paradise. It’s called Gougane Barra, a mountain tarn where craggy hills are reflected in cool, soft waters. There is a car park but yours may be the only car. This is Ireland off the beaten track, one of those little gems whose praises local people would sing to you if you’d only stop to listen. Cross the causeway to the lake’s little island and, nestled among the rhododendrons, you will find St Finbarr’s Oratory, a tiny 19th-century chapel that could have been created as the backdrop to a perfect wedding album. Ireland teems with surprises like this, and these off-the-beaten-track gems are actually quite easy to find. Friendly locals love to share their recommendations with interested visitors, and sometimes all it takes is turning down a quiet lane to see a spectacular rural scene unfold before you, discover a quaint local pub or find a beautiful church or tumbledown cottage you didn’t even know existed. For a glimpse into Ireland’s really ancient past, head north again to Grianán of Aileach, a massive, circular, stone hill fort almost 4,000 years old Back in Gougane Barra, if you rejoin the main road and head west, you can pick up the Beara Way around the little-visited Beara Peninsula. It winds over mountain passes and past ancient stone circles, part of the Wild Atlantic Way, the world’s longest defined coastal route. At its apex is Ireland’s only cable car, swaying 250ft above the turbulent Atlantic to the rocky island haven of Dursey, one of the few islands off the southwest coast that’s still inhabited. The Blasket Islands off County Kerry’s Dingle Peninsula were abandoned half a century ago, but you can still reach them via the stunning harbour of Dunquin, where a winding access path gingerly negotiates the sheer cliffs on gigantic piers. Take the passenger ferry to Great Blasket and you can be at one with wheeling sea birds, lolloping seals and a prehistoric past. A hundred miles north, at Cnoc Suain amid the rolling hills and bogs of Connemara, a little piece of Irish history has been lovingly re-created by a remarkable couple, Charlie Troy and Dearbhaill Standún. Chance to reflect: enjoy some peace and tranquility in Gougane Barra They’ve painstakingly restored a hamlet of 17th-century cottages to provide tranquil holiday accommodation, sweeping views and a range of Gaelic cultural experiences embracing everything from the freshest local produce to traditional music. Unlike Cnoc Suain’s cottages, Bunlahinch Clapper Bridge in Co Mayo isn’t as old as it looks. At 160ft, it’s Ireland’s longest complete clapper bridge, and was probably built in the 1840s by a local religious community. But it looks suitably ancient and it’s an unexpectedly impressive sight, striding across the gentle, fertile plain. For a glimpse into Ireland’s really ancient past, head north again to Grianán of Aileach, a massive, circular, stone hill fort almost 4,000 years old. Amazingly it’s just a few miles from Derry~Londonderry but it feels like the edge of the ancient world, with panoramic views of Donegal’s windblown Inishowen Peninsula and the sweep of wild Atlantic beyond. Time has been less kind to Dunseverick Castle on County Antrim’s north coast. All that remains of the 5th-century fortification are a few fingers of stone perched high on a rocky outcrop, but the sense of place is terrific, and you may have it all to yourself. Drive on along Northern Ireland’s spectacular Causeway Coastal Route and you’ll reach Ballycastle, ferry point for Rathlin Island. Famous as the place where Robert the Bruce encountered his motivational spider, Rathlin is a six-mile-long breath of fresh air, where seals frolic and puffins, guillemots and kittiwakes outnumber humans by zillions to one. On a clear day you can see for miles. Sea birds too noisy? Then roam south, calling in at Glenariff Forest Park, considered the most beautiful of Antrim's peaceful glens. Follow one of the beautiful forest trails to discover bubbling rivers, pretty waterfalls and view points that look out across the lush landscape. Then continue still further south to Silent Valley in the misty Mountains of Mourne. To nearby Belfast, the long, cool lake is just a giant reservoir, but visitors may find it refreshes the soul as effectively as the body. Ireland is full of undiscovered jewels like these. All you have to do is listen to their call. • Come and find your holiday inspiration at ireland.com 'Live in the now' in Ireland Savour every second in Ireland, where the natural beauty, the culture and the people all seem to exist together in a timeless moment.
