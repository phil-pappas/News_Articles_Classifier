Published on : Friday, October 2, 2015\nEarlier this year, British archaeologist and Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves published a paper claiming that Nefertiti’s tomb is hidden behind the tomb of Tutankhamun. He tried to prove his theory and visited Luxor’s Valley of the Kings on 29 September to explore the tomb of the young king.\nReeves, Egypt’s Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damaty and Tourism Minister Hisham Zazou visited the site in an attempt to solve the mystery.\n“Originally this entire wall was painted and decorated in order to make people not think there was nothing further beyond”, Reeves declares about the resting place.\nTourism industry in Egypt collapsed after 2011 protests that led to President Hosni Mubarak fall. If Queen Nefertiti’s tomb is found, tourism in Egypt could boost in an unprecedented way.\nLater this year, Egypt will start a global advertising campaign to promote country’s tourism. Tourism minister Hisham Zazou is positive that this strategy will revive the tourism industry sector in Egypt.\n“First, we’ll begin with the British market – so the campaign, the flying, the marketing, the solving of the problems of the sector, the attempt to find a swift resolution for the production tools – the still and moving hotels – are all things that, I think, will take place during the following month or two. I will exert my best effort – and I think that will all promote the tourism movement – I hope so. Hopefully by this December, things will be looking up and we will enter 2016 strong,” he declares.\nLater today, archaeologist Nicholas Reeves will hold a press conference in Cairo to unveil the findings of his tomb investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:06:33.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
