Or just somewhere a lot cheaper.”\nBritain’s twisted take on Disneyland is going through another metamorphosis.\nElusive British street artist Banksy says his now-closed Dismaland “bemusement park” will be dismantled and its parts will be shipped to Calais, France where they’ll provide shelters for Europe’s migrants flooding the continent.\n “Coming soon… Dismaland Calais,” the Dismaland website reads , under an image of the Dismaland castle standing in the middle of the migrant camp. “All the timber and fixtures from Dismaland are being sent to the ‘jungle’ refugee camp near Calais to build shelters. No online tickets will be available.”\nThe park, which featured work from more than 50 artists, included installments of a run-down version of Sleeping Beauty’s castle and a morbid scene of the paparazzi snapping picturess of a dead Cinderella.\nIn August, tickets for Dismaland sold out within hours of going on sale, and officials say the park attracted more than 150,000 visitors and $30 million, the BBC reported.\nThe park closed on Sept. 27 but there’s little information on who is building the shelters or how the project would work.\nMore on this...
