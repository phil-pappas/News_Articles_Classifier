The new Festival Kreol hymn was officially launched this week during a ceremony at the National Cultural Centre in the presence of the Minister for Tourism and Culture Alain St.Ange, principal secretary for culture Benjamine Rose, chief executive of the National Arts Council Jimmy Savy, artists and representatives of the Seychelles Musicians Association. Five past winners of the Festival Kreol song competition ̶ Joenise Juliette, Patrick Joseph, Simon Amade, Sandra Esparon and Jean-Marc Volcy ̶ were selected to compose the new hymn. \nThe idea for the hymn was presented to the Ministry of Tourism and Culture as well as the Festival Kreol committee by Mr Bacco and it was accepted. \nFor the past 29 years, Seychelles had adopted Joe Samy’s hit song “ Lasezon Kreol” as the hymn for Festival Kreol. \nThe new hymn entitled Rasanble Kreol will be played during October, as this year it has been dedicated as the Creole month. Minister St.Ange congratulated and thanked the five artists and Mr Bacco for such brilliant initiative, before presenting them with their certificates. \nHe added that it is encouraging to see how Seychellois musicians can rally together to bring our cultural events to a higher level. Minister St.Ange said Mr Bacco and the artists have made Seychelles proud with this initiative. \nThis year’s Festival Kreol will be officially launched on October 24 in what is meant to be a spectacular ceremony, showcasing the colourful and vibrant Creole culture in many aspects. \nA series of activities have been organised during the month of October across the country to celebrate our Creole identity. Friends from the other Creole-speaking countries are also expected to be in Seychelles to join in the celebrations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:52:43.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
