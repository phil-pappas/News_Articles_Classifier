The Tour de Sonoma package has days of riding that could be on par with the Tour de France. (Sonoma on a Bike) Phil Marty Chicago Tribune Biking in Sonoma comes with great refreshments. \nSonoma on a Bike is a company that aims to satisfy travelers whose passions include biking and wine. The company's Tour de Sonoma package has days of riding that could be on par with the Tour de France. One day, for example, has 90 miles of biking, and another is 58 miles with 4,500 feet of elevation gain, all the while taking in gorgeous Sonoma County. It's also possible to do more moderate rides. Interspersed with the riding are visits to some of the region's most notable wineries, including Roth, Ferrari-Carano and Fog Crest. The six-day tour is limited to just 12 bikers and has multiple dates in 2016. The $3,400 per person double-occupancy rate covers lodging, meals, wine with meals, use of Specialized Allez Comp bikes, bike guides, van support and more.

For instance, there'll be two tours in the Tetons and Yellowstone National Park next August that are priced from $1,999 per person double occupancy. Book by March 31, and you'll get free air from several cities. That tour will include a float trip down the Snake River in Grand Teton National Park, an aerial tram ride to the top of a mountain for some high-altitude hiking, canoeing and working on a service project. The package covers seven nights' lodging, most meals, 11 field trips as well as lectures and hands-on experiences. Other packages offered are in locations such as San Antonio, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Banff, Alberta.
