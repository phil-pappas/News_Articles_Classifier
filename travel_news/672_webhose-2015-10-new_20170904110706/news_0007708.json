PAUL MARKHOLM \nJA-class steam train 1240 - which would break down on its final run - racing through Templeton on the outskirts of Christchurch on the daily South Express in 1971. \nThe day brought to an end 108 years of regular steam operations in New Zealand but, as Government history website nzhistory.net.nz points out, the writing had long been on the wall. \nThe move to diesel had begun long before and by the late 1960s all North Island trains were running on diesel. \nThe South Island only lagged because the overnight Christchurch-Dunedin run needed steam heating through the cold months of winter. CHRISTINE CORNEGE/FAIRFAX NZ \nInside a JA-class 1271 locomotive, build in 1956 at Hillside in Dunedin. \nBut the introduction of train heating vans on diesels meant diesel was here stay, even if some steam trains would live on doing tourist runs. \nFor Christchurch man Paul Markholmit was undoubtedly a sad day. \nHe had travelled the Christchurch-Dunedin run many times and still remembers the slow slog through the suburbs of Christchurch and over the railway crossings. PAUL MARKHOLM \nThe train that would run New Zealand's last schedule steam service. \nThen he remembers the train hitting the flat expanse of the Canterbury Plains heading south. Ad Feedback \nOfficially the speed was 60mph (100kmh) but Markholm, a longtime train fan, would often chase the train across the plains in his car. \n\"I have been alongside the side of the express in a little old Austin doing 78mph (125kmh),\" he recalled this week. \n\"They were called a greyhound because they were really, really good for going across the Canterbury Plains.\" \nOn the train the ride was smooth and - with no cafeteria on board - the first stop heading south for refreshments was Ashburton, where travellers had 10 minutes before the train departed again. \n\"You jumped off the train and rushed into the refreshment room... for a cup of tea and a piece of fruit cake.\" \nWith passengers sipping their cups of tea the train would head south through Timaru, Oamaru, Palmerston. \nA boy would come along to collect the cups to take back to Ashburton. \nOamaru was more relaxed and passengers had time for a three-course meal while the locomotives were switched. \nThe Christchurch one would return north while the Dunedin one, having just hauled passengers from the south, would head back south. \nDecades later Markholm clearly remembers the trip's highlight as he - a rail fan since buying a book about New Zealand locomotives off a mate in school - pulled down the window as it noisily hauled through the hills of Dunedin. \n\"Hearing it working up the hills. You had to be there to understand. \n\"The beat of the locomotive, the rhythmic blast of the exhaust.\" \nBy 2015's standards the train seems like a rolling environmental catastrophe. \nAbout four tonnes of coal would get it to Oamaru, where another four tonnes were loaded for the onwards journey. \nAt each of the four stops, about 3000 gallons (11,300 litres) of water was put on. \nThe final service was a night run with trains leaving Dunedin and Christchurch, heading north and south respectively, shortly before 11pm. \nThe night run had a sleeping carriage or two that those with the money could ride, two per cabin, with a hostess in the carriage to turn the seats into beds at bedtime. \nMarkholm did the run many times but was not on board for that final run 44 years ago. \nInstead, camera in hand, he waited at Burnham, south of Christchurch. \nThe southbound service had already completed its overnight run making the northbound run New Zealand's last scheduled steam train run. \nBut it was to be a sad ending. \nThe locomotive threw a brass bearing from the driving rod and the train pulled to a stop at Rolleston, tantalisingly close to finishing the final run. \nA diesel locomotive was brought in to haul the carriage and passengers the final few miles to Christchurch. \nThe steam locomotive - that came so close to finishing in style - had a hasty repair and \"went back home with its tail between its legs\", Markholm said. \n\"It was sad, especially the way it broke down.\" \nMarkholm had spent years photographing trains, chasing them across the Canterbury Plains. \n\"Funnily enough,\" he said this week, \"I put my camera down and didn't take a photo seriously after that.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:09:06.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
