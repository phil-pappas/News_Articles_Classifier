Management encourages shareholders to test the platform and recommend their friends and family do the same – booking their next travel plans through Oveedia.\n\"If you are a true shareholder of PNOW, this is the moment you've been waiting for,\" stated Melvin Pereira , President and CEO of Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. \"On October 9 th , Oveedia will become one of the first OTA's catering primarily to Central America and the Latin speaking countries of the Caribbean . This is truly an exciting time. Not only because of the huge economic value proposition it creates for PNOW shareholders, but because of the confidence it instills in shareholders that my team and I got the job done!\"\nJust six days following the one year anniversary of when Mr. Pereira stepped into the CEO role, Pure Hospitality Solutions stands ready to launch Oveedia , having seen a number of successes along the way. This includes real estate acquisitions, increasing asset values, generating first revenues, and reducing millions of dollars in legacy debt. Then, in a move to charter a course for explosive growth, Mr. Pereira refocused the Company, concentrating on the rebirth of FROL (Friendly Reservations Online).\nWith online travel sales exploding in Latin America , PURE stands ready to launch Oveedia, as the $34 Billion anticipated for this market, weighs the Central American- Caribbean region lightly. However, with nearly two million reviews (as per TripAdvisor) , in a region where there are over 16,000 properties – not fully represented by most OTAs, if any – the area is becoming a very hot topic. This is just one reason, \"Oveedia could become a real winner in the Latin American OTA market,\" said Mr. Pereira.\nMr. Pereira concluded, \"Hotels that have begun to sign with us, have done so exclusively; some even having agreed to drop their current listings with Airbnb . That will be the power of Oveedia! One of a kind properties, spanning over 300,000 square miles of a region, virtually untouched by the online travel industry, listed exclusively on Oveedia, during a time where Latin America tourism is outpacing the Asia-Pacific .\"\nThere resides the intrinsic value of Oveedia to conglomerates such as Expedia , Priceline , and now, Google . Management is confident, October 9 th , 2015, will begin Oveedia's ascent to becoming the Central American-Caribbean travel hub.\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners.
