The president was unhurt. \nAdheeb, who was in Singapore after inaugurating the Maldives Investment Forum in China, dismissed allegations that he was the mastermind behind the explosion. He did return and Vice President Ahmed Adeeb was in detention and being charged with high treason. \nMr. Adeeb, who has denied any links to the explosion, had only been Vice President for three months. \nHe came to office when the previous Vice President was sacked by Mr. Yameen, also on charges of treason. \nA large police and military was spotted on the capital island of Male, while tourism activities in the country continued as normal.
