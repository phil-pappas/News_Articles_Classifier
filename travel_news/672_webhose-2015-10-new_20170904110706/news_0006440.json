The automotive exhaust systems comprise five components: engine manifold, engine down pipe, catalytic convertor, muffler, and tail pipe.\nThe global automotive exhaust systems market is growing at a healthy rate. This growth is mainly driven by changing emission norms in different regions across the globe. Latest emission regulations have reduced the volume of allowed emissions from the exhaust systems of the automobiles, and hence exhaust system manufacturers have been investing heavily in the R&D for technologically advanced exhausts that comply with new guidelines.\nThis report covers major global players in this industry including Eberspacher GmbH ( Germany ), Tenneco Inc (U.S.), Faurecia SA ( France ), Sango Industrial Co Ltd ( Japan ), and Futaba Industrial Co Ltd ( Japan ). In 2014, these companies jointly accounted for the highest amount of revenue in the exhaust systems market. These manufacturers offer exhaust systems to OEMS that comply with the new and latest emission norms prescribed by the governments. The new emission norms have made after-treatment devices a necessary component, as these help OEMs keep a check on the emission levels produced by the vehicles, and reduce the emission of harmful green house gases. The different after-treatment devices used are diesel particulate filter (DPF), diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), lean NOx trap (LNT), selective catalytic reduction (SCR), and gasoline particulate filter (GPF). All these devices reduce carbon emissions from a vehicle and help in bettering the environment.\nThe report also discusses the qualitative aspects of the market such as the market dynamics, Porter's Five Forces analysis, and PEST analysis, which provide an overview of the forces shaping the industry in major regions such as North America , Asia-Oceania, and Europe . The report covers the automotive exhaust systems market globally from 2015 to 2020 in terms of volume and value, segmented by region (Asia-Oceania, North America , Europe , and ROW), by vehicle type (passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and heavy commercial vehicles), by fuel type (gasoline and diesel), by component (exhaust manifold, engine downpipe, catalytic converter, muffler, resonator, and tail pipe), and after-treatment devices used (DPF, DOC, LNT, TWC, SCR, and GPF).\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3090187/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/automotive-exhaust-systems-market-by-after-treatment-device-components-fuel-type-and-by-region---trends--forecast-to-2020-300165139.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
