The charity depends on the support of the public to continue its work. The organisation has a wide-ranging role, rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming hundreds of thousands of animals each year, offering advice on caring for all animals and actively campaigning to change laws to further protect animals. And of course, the RSPCA enforces animal welfare in England and Wales by prosecuting individuals in appropriate cases. It is this latter role that was the primary motive behind the establishment of the RSPCA. One of the first pieces of legislation on animal welfare had just been passed by parliament – the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822 – and the existing authorities seemed unwilling to enforce the new laws effectively. The RSPCA was set up to publicise and manage the new Act. The RSPCA is a hard-working, dedicated organisation with a clear focus on improving the lives of animals Over the years, the role of the RSPCA has developed and diversified, extending into animal issues across all species and all of society. The charity now provides care for animals, running its own rescue centres, treating sick and injured wildlife and attending to call-outs from the public wherever there is an animal in distress. This high level of service is so well established that it is often taken for granted by the public in England and Wales. In the past decade, the RSPCA has encountered a new challenge, with the enactment of the most significant change in animal welfare legislation for almost a century: the Animal Welfare Act 2006. One of the roles of the organisation is to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome hundreds of thousands of animals each year The new Act has been widely welcomed, with its insistence on a greater duty of care for those who are responsible for the health and welfare of animals. There are new codes of practice for the care of different species, which provide practical guidance to help people comply with these legal requirements. The RSPCA has been at the forefront of publicising and enforcement of this legislation. RSPCA inspectors work closely with the police and local authorities who support them to help animals in danger. The RSPCA is a hard-working, dedicated organisation with a clear focus on improving the lives of animals. If you care about animal welfare, the RSPCA deserves your support.
