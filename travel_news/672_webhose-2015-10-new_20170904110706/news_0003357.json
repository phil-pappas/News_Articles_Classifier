Known for quality, consistency and convenience, GLAMSQUAD delivers an unparalleled beauty experience and confidence to thousands of time-starved women in New York, Los Angeles and Miami each week. In total, GLAMSQUAD has raised $24 million to date. As part of this Series B round, Dayna Grayson, a general partner of NEA, has joined the GLAMSQUAD Board of Directors.\n \nGLAMSQUAD intends to use the proceeds of this round to accelerate its growth nationwide, expand its engineering and marketing capabilities and explore preliminary development of new products and services. Areas of focus will include bridal services, GLAMSQUAD-branded products and e-commerce capabilities.\n \n“This financing is the result of continued, record-setting growth,” says Alexandra Wilkis Wilson, Co-founder and CEO of GLAMSQUAD. “Each week, we hit new appointment count and revenue records. We have quintupled our run-rate revenue from just one year ago and are looking ahead to expansion in Washington, D.C., Dallas, Chicago and many more cities.”\n \n“NEA is a perfect partner for GLAMSQUAD as the Company continues to build a powerful new distribution system for beauty services and products,” says Jason Perri, the Company’s Co-founder and Chairman. “The team is excited to leverage NEA’s expertise in building and scaling consumer brands and marketplaces.”\n \nDayna Grayson, general partner of NEA, added, “GLAMSQUAD has developed a unique and powerful brand in less than two years and is poised to take increasing share of the massive $100 billion market for beauty services and products.
