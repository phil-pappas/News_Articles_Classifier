The week-­long calendar gives users more opportunities for spontaneous travel, which is our main goal at HotelQuickly,” said Tomas Laboutka, co-­founder and CEO of HotelQuickly. \n\nAccording to a media statement, the app, available on iOS and Android smartphone devices, provides last-minute hotel booking services at rates 28 per cent lower than other online options on average. \n\nLaboutka adds that the booking window extension is just one in a series of features HotelQuickly is set to debut over the next few months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:30:39.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
