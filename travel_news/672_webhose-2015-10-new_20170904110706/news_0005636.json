Other factors that would keep costs down is Norwegian Air’s small staff and the use of the new Boeing 737 MAX, which is narrow-bodied, fuel-efficient, and comprised entirely of economy seats.\nFlying’s so shitty these days that we’ll take extreme cost-cutting mechanisms for a lower plane ticket price any day.
