Senior Vice President and General Manager of Virtual Payments. “Customer feedback is invaluable and the LUG provides the perfect forum to capture this.” \nSpecific feedback from a number of strategic travel customers such as helloworld and The Travel Corporation, was about the value they gained from interacting with their peer groups and exchanging ideas. \nMick Mag, Financial Controller (Wholesale) from the helloworld Group said he “found the conference both informative and extremely enjoyable. The conference definitely helped reiterate to me that we are on the right track with WEX and I look forward to implementing the plans that we currently have in track. The opportunity to mix with peers from other travel companies was also very welcome. All in all, a great conference and a great location to boot.” \nChris Dignan, Group Finance Operations Manager for Webjet Group agreed that “the LUG provided a fantastic opportunity to assemble with travel industry peers and share best practice insights into global payment processes.” He also noted that “The beautiful setting in Portland coupled with a relaxed atmosphere afforded a memorable experience. Can’t wait to return next year!” \n“The WEX conference is always very informative and helps keep our business up with the latest global market and payment technology trends”, said James O’Donnell, Finance Director of The Travel Corporation. “WEX always make you feel that no task is too great. A great company to be associated with.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:26:40.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
