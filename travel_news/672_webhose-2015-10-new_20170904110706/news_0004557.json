Due to this scheduled maintenance, the trains will not be transporting passengers between the hours of 1 and 4 a.m. on Oct. 15-16, Oct. 20-23, Oct. 27-30, Nov. 3-6, Nov. 10-13, and Nov. 17-20.\n \nDuring the maintenance work, passengers must use the A Bridge-security checkpoint, located on Level 6, north, in Jeppesen Terminal from 9 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. during the evenings of the work because the north and south security checkpoints will be closed. The time it takes to go through the TSA security checkpoint will not be impacted because there is normally only one TSA checkpoint open between 9 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. The majority of the flights during this timeframe depart from the A Gates so most passengers will not be\nimpacted. However, those passengers departing on a flight from the B or C Gates between 1 and 4 a.m. will be directed through the A Bridge-security checkpoint, and will then be directed by airport personnel to bus stops for transport to the B and C Concourses.\n \nCustomer service staff will be available to help guide passengers to the appropriate checkpoint and to the buses. Passengers should allow extra time to arrive at their gate.\nIt is possible that a few flights will arrive at the B and C Gates during this timeframe; those passengers should expect to be bused to the A Concourse for access via the pedestrian bridge to Jeppesen Terminal. Airport personnel and signage will assist with way finding. When possible, airlines may deplane passengers on the A Concourse for easier access to the pedestrian bridge leading to Jeppesen Terminal.\n \nAirport operations will make the decision whether or not to proceed with the train shutdown each evening in case there are any significant changes in airline schedules due to weather, etc.Throughout the year, there will be additional dates the trains will be not be operational between the hours of 1 and 4 a.m. More information will be provided prior to those dates.\n \n \nSource:- Denver International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:31:37.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
