Published on : Monday, October 12, 2015\nOn October 18, Azerbaijan celebrates its Independence Day. This year too, people of Azerbaijan are all set to commemorate the day with all zeal and fervour. Post the adoption of Constitutional Act, the country gained its much-awaited independence after facing several challenges and its independence was re-declared in 1991.\nBackground\nAzerbaijan twice had the opportunity to become a sovereign state during the 20th century. Unfortunately, the first opportunity failed shortly thereafter because of outside interference, internal opposition and the general political instability. Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the first secular democratic state in the Islamic world, which was established in 1918, existed for only 23 months. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan was provided with opportunity to restore the lost independence. Azerbaijan became a member of the United Nations on March 2, 1992 and the de facto recognition of Azerbaijan by the world community begins from that date.\nA day at Azerbaijan\nMarvel at Shirvanshah Palace Dating back to the 15th century, this is the largest monument in Baku’s Old City and gives the flavour of the rich and cultured lifestyle of the Persian Sufi ruling dynasty.\nHiking tours Find the unique ethnic group of proto-Caucasians in the remote mountain village of Xinaliq. They are inhabited in the part of the mountains since the Bronze Age\nSirvan National Park This little-visited place due south of Gobustan is worth exploring because of its coastal wilderness.

It was rebuilt as a fortress in the 12th century.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:39:14.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
