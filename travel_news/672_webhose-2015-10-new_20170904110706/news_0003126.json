The sale will be valid until 11 October 2015, midnight South African time. These seats are available on a first-come-first-serve basis and all levies, taxes and/or surcharges will be for the members’ own account.\nThe JourneyBlitz Awards mileage thresholds are on average 70% to 85% less in Miles than the Dynamic Awards.\n“This is our third redemption seat sale since the relaunch of the SAA Voyager programme on 1 February 2015. Our members have welcomed the regular redemption seat sales due to the exceptionally low mileage thresholds. Although members are required to be flexible in their date of travel, our Business Class seats for international travel have been most popular and we are pleased that the JourneyBlitz Awards are increasing customer value,” says Suretha Cruse, SAA Executive Customer Loyalty.\n \n \nSAA Voyager programme partners gain access to a rich partner network and one of the biggest loyalty databases on the continent, which has proven to translate to increased revenues and enhanced customer retention.\n \nSource:- SAA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:19:50.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
