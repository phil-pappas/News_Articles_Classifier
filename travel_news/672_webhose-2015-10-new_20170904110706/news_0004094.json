Mount Etna and the Baroque towns on Sicily's south-eastern coast are also already part of the initiative. \nVisiting Arab-Norman Palermo and the other sites has never been easier for British visitors, with a number of airlines flying directly to the island. easyJet and Ryanair both fly to Palermo from Stansted and Gatwick respectively, while easyjet also flies to Catania from Manchester, Gatwick, Luton, Bristol and East Midlands. \nBA and Norwegian also fly to Catania, while Ryanair also serves Comiso. Thomson and Thomas Cook also operate charter flights to the island. \nThere is another airport - Trapani - which Ryanair currently uses for flights to some thirty destinations around Europe but none from the UK. \nThe Sicily tourist board will be looking to sign contract at WTM London 2015 with buyers from tour operators and travel agents while promoting the islands many unique attraction to the wider travel and tourism industry. \nWTM London, Senior Director, Simon Press, said: \"We are delighted to give Sicily the platform to promote the island's latest inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List. \n“The Arab-Norman Palermo has massive cultural and historical heritage, effectively showing the evolution of Europe and its Empires since the twelfth century. \n“And with some many flights from the UK, including regional departures, accessing the island and its many attractions has never been easier.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:45:19.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
