Watch as these powerful propellers make ship navigation more precise than ever before. Richard Tribou Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel Florida will get five new cruise ships in the next 12 months \nWhile Florida is about to get its newest cruise ship with the debut of Norwegian Escape next month, other lines continue construction of new megaships, some of which will make their way to the Sunshine State within the next 12 months. \nOne of those is what will become the largest cruise ship in the world, Oasis-class Harmony of the Seas, which has already been floated out at the STX Shipyards in St. Nazairre, France. \nDue in April 2016, Harmony of the Seas will debut in Europe for the summer and then make its way to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, where both Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas have made a home since their debut in 2009 and 2010. \nWith Harmony's arrival, Oasis of the Seas will try its hand serving Central Florida out of Port Canaveral, meaning Florida will be home to the three biggest ships in the world. A fourth Oasis-class vessel is due in 2018. \nMeanwhile, Royal Caribbean's third Quantum-class ship, Ovation of the Seas, is taking shape at Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany. Ovation of the Seas will make its way to China, where Quantum of the Seas is currently sailing. The Chinese market has commanded the majority of headlines lately, with Norwegian, Carnival, Princess, MSC and Royal Caribbean all announcing plans to shift focus on the burgeoning cruise market. \nImages of the third Oasis-class ship that is set to debut in April 2016. The ship will be the largest cruise ship in the world. \nThat doesn't mean Florida is out of the loop, though. \nOn the heels of Harmony of the Seas will be Carnival Vista, which debuts in June 2016 and will sail Europe before repositioning to New York and then Miami by November 2016. Also South Florida bound will be the new Holland America Koningsdam, which will sail the Mediterranean beginning in April 2016, but make its way to Port Everglades to sail the Caribbean from November 2016 to March 2017. \nAlso coming to South Florida in 2016 will be what's billed as the most luxurious cruise ship ever built when Regent Seven Seas Explorer makes its way to Miami by December. \nThe Ovation of the Seas is the third Quantum-class ship from Royal Caribbean International. It's due in April 2016. \nFarther down the line will be the MSC Seaside coming to Miami in 2017. \nThere's also still a fourth Quantum-class ship on order for Royal Caribbean. The yet-to-be-named ship due in 2018 could end up finally bringing what many consider the top-of-the-line cruise ship to a Florida port, or the original Quantum of the Seas or New York-based Anthem of the Seas could find their way to one of Florida's three major ports. \nEven without a Quantum-class ship home porting in Florida, the Sunshine State will still see five new vessels in the next 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:42:34.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
