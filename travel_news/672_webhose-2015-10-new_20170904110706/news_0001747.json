No injuries were reported. \n\"We can't immediately confirm when the last time a runway incident involving a vehicle last occurred, but this is extremely rare,\" said Nancy Castles, a spokeswoman for LAWA who has worked for the LAX operator for 20 years. Ad Feedback \nFAA officials said they will investigate the incident. The Compass jet, which was flying for Delta Connection, departed for Kansas City International Airport after a short delay. \nAirport officials said they intercepted the car and later rescinded the employee's authorization to drive on airfield service roads. The driver had not been cleared to go on or near runways, officials said. \nThe emergency landings included a Delta Airlines A330 from Atlanta to Honolulu that diverted to LAX because of a medical emergency. \nThe other urgent landing involved an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 from LAX to Seattle, which returned because of a mechanical issue and landed without incident shortly after noon. \nTNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:38:27.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
