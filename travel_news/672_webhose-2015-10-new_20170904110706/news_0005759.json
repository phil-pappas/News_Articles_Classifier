While demand has kept ticket prices down from previous years, the best deals for the best seats on the most popular fights will be ending soon. Travelers who procrastinate booking flights until later in the season may find less non-stop and connecting options available.\nOnline travel agency JustAirTicket.com President Ashish Rathour says, “travelers booking later than mid-October should remain flexible when choosing their dates as lower price points are expected to fill flights quickly.” He explains that the longer travelers wait to book their flights the less selection they will have, and that prices may be higher for the seats that are available.\nJust Air Ticket offers the cheapest fares for all popular destinations. Customers will find deals for destinations in Asia, India, Europe, the United Kingdom, and across the United States. Vacation deals and special fares offered only by Just Air Ticket get travelers where they need to go for the best price available.\nAccording to the Airline Quality Rating (AQR) forecast by Wichita State University, demand will be strong this holiday season, and travelers should consider the higher passenger volume and possibility of weather-related delays when making their plans. The AQR suggests travelers should travel well before the holiday season or well after as the holiday season typically sees lower on-time arrivals and greater percentages of baggage mishandling.
