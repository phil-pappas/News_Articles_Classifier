It gives me an excellent chance to make more wonderful friends. USA, 14 October 2015 -- Hi, everyone! I'm Timmy, a teenage boy from Denver city. As you can see from my childish face, I'm still a student in middle school. Here I have to admit that I was so introverted that I never said a word to the stranger proactively before. Of course I barely had some friends until my mother sent me a present when it was my birthday. I never thought it should be a Airwheel Self-balancing Electric scooter . Since then my life is totally changed. This scooter designed withoutany patterns just solid colors without losing fashion elements is getting a hit in my school. In the light of the aviation attitude control system, I gradually got the point to catch its balance point. Anyway to keep balance on the twin-wheeled electric scooter is the key. After one week, I realize that practice makes perfect. For scooter's flexibility, I can ride it on a narrow rough path, such as the muddy pavement, lawn, and rainy road as well as country lane. Now my classmates or some school mates come up to me for absorbing the skill to control the mini scooter. Then I am patient to explain to them how to ride rightly. When speed exceeds 12km/h, the front end of pedal will rise gradually; when it exceeds16km/h, the pedal will pose a 10 degreereferred to the horizontal plane, which keep you from inclining further to accelerate.As time goes, I have been accepted by them, and we set up a team of scooter, and recommending me as team leader. When I hear that news I feel flattered. Slowly I get extroverted and talkative as I make more friends. Weekends and holidays are our big day. We can gather together with my teammates in the plaza where we can practice the ridding skill. It attracts more team members' joining. Rolling on the electric scooter is my happiest thing in my life. Thanks to my mom and that company provides such a smart wheel. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:11:39.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
