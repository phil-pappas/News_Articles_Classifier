The confrontation was captured on video by one of the passengers and has since gone viral. It all began when Tiana Fough, a mother of two, was chatting with several other travelers while boarding the flight headed from Phoenix to Portland, KATU News reports. Fough said she didn't hear one of the flight attendants when he asked her to move to the side, so she was shocked when she says he began yelling at her. \"He did not have my eye contact,\" she told KATU. \"He didn't have my attention. I didn't even hear him until he started yelling at me.\" The flight attendant then threatened to kick her off the plane, Fough said, so she quickly took her seat. When another member of the flight crew walked by several minutes later, Fough told that flight attended how she'd been treated. Shortly after that, the first flight attended showed up at her seat and told Fough she was being booted from the flight. That's when the passenger sitting behind Fough, Bill Byrne, pulled out his cellphone and began recording. \"He opened up the overhead compartments and said, 'Where's your stuff? You're getting off this plane right now,'\" Fough told KATU. In the video Byrne captured, you can hear Fough crying as she pleads with the flight crew to let her stay on the plane, asking what she did wrong. \"Are you serious?\" she says. \"This can't be legal. I didn't do anything.\" But the flight attendant remained firm in his resolve, and as he escorted Fough from the plane, passengers who witnessed the confrontation booed loudly. \"I've seen people who deserve that, but never actually seen somebody thrown off a plane,\" Byrne said. \"She handled it well, but you could tell it was super embarrassing for her.\" Amidst the boos, you can hear passengers expressing their disgust. \"Shame on American!\" says one passenger. \"You just lost a lot of customers,\" says another. Officials with American Airlines told KATU they're aware of the video and will look into the incident leading up to Fough's removal from the flight. They said Fough was booked on the next flight to Portland.
