I would encourage you to work closely together on this.”\nA party source said: “Jeremy is clear that he expects Labour to now oppose a third runway at Heathrow. It is now up to the Government to decide what to do.”\nIf Corbyn officially opposes Heathrow expansion he will join a list of influential MPs who have also spoke out against it, including Sadiq Kahn, Boris Johnson and Zac Goldsmith.\nLast week, Heathrow published images of what a third runway would like.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-corbyn-calls-on-labour-to-put-pollution-on-the-agenda-by-opposing-heathrow-expansion-a6691496.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:28:23.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
