There will be those who think that dividing up the nation into early risers and late-to-bedders is nothing more than fanciful but, as far as I am concerned, the fact is carved in stone. The prospect of doing anything constructive after 10pm, apart from half an hour’s reading in bed, is out of the question. For living the night life on a regular basis, I leave that to those sterling folk like Imelda Staunton Night owls who think that life begins at 40 minutes past midnight remain, to me, a mystery, for by then my engine has shut down and the only place I want to visit is the Land of Nod, not a nightclub where the music pounds though my head and drinks are £10 a pop. It’s not that I am a fan of Horlicks or Ovaltine. It’s just that by this hour my batteries need recharging as they will have been on the go since some time between 6am and 7am. Waking up can be difficult at first...but porridge always fixes that Photo: GETTY Oh, I admit to feeling bleary on rising, but after a restorative shower and a blast with the hairdryer, a bowl of porridge is all it takes to put me in fine fettle for the day ahead. This is when – all being well – the words will flow in the studio or on the page, when my work rate is at its greatest and when I can – with good luck and a following wind – be pleasant to my fellow man and at one with my laptop. A solid morning of writing – columns or novels – takes me to about 2pm, by which time my creativity is at a pretty low ebb and I can treat myself to a few hours in the garden to unwind . Supper is family time, should any of them be around, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that the day’s work is done. Imagine having to start your labours early in the evening. It is, under normal circumstances, totally out of the question. My brain is addled by then and my palate craves a glass of claret or rioja. Alan Titchmarsh in the Royal Opera Houses production of The Wind in the Willows at the Vaudeville Theatre Mind you, last year I did have a taster of the night life, spending a couple of months on stage in the West End as the narrator of The Wind in the Willows . My official working day, then, began at 7pm, and was all over, bar the shouting of compliments to the cast, before 10, when I headed home on the train for the tastiest gin and tonic that ever passed my lips. I loved every minute of it, but as for living the night life on a regular basis, I leave that to those sterling folk like Imelda Staunton , who has been wowing audiences nightly since April in a fabulous production of Gypsy at the Savoy Theatre . God willing, she will lie in until noon each day, the better to restore her energy for the evening. I should have done that, of course, but asking a lark to stay in bed until noon is like asking a blackbird not to sing. Even during my theatrical spell, I was up early. There we are then: I’ve made my point.
