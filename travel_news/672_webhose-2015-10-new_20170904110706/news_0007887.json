The value could increase to $651 million USD if all options are exercised.\n“The long-term profitability and development of our airline is dependent on the addition of modern, fuel-efficient aircraft to our fleet. The CRJ900 jetliners with their lower operating costs, outstanding operational flexibility and enhanced cabin amenities were key factors in our successful tender for our new SAS contract,” said Pat Byrne, Executive Chairman, CityJet. “As a long-time regional operator for some of Europe’s finest airlines, we are pleased to add SAS to our list of distinguished customers.”\n“We are looking forward to working with CityJet to further expand our regional route network and thereby strengthen SAS’ offering to frequent travelers. These new Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft from CityJet will provide us with efficient and flexible production of regional flights that will feed our larger traffic flows and will complement nicely the 12 CRJ900 aircraft in SAS’ current network operation,” said Rickard Gustafson, President and CEO at SAS.\n“We welcome CityJet as the newest member to the CRJ aircraft family. With its unique operations, CityJet has forged strong business relationships with many of Bombardier’s long-standing customers, such as SAS who now look to CityJet’s expertise for their network growth,” said Ryan DeBrusk, Vice President, Sales, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Russia & Commonwealth of Independent States, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft. “CityJet brings an impressive amount of knowledge and experience in the wet lease market whereby it will now provide airlines with modern aircraft, crews and maintenance for operation.”\nCRJ700 Order\nBombardier Commercial Aircraft also announced that a long-standing customer, who has requested to remain unidentified at this time, has signed a firm purchase agreement for two CRJ700 aircraft.\nBased on the list price for the CRJ700 aircraft, the firm order is valued at approximately $86 million US.\nIncluding both firm agreements, Bombardier has recorded firm orders for 1,873 CRJ Series aircraft.
