More than 20,000 U.N. participants from 195 countries are expected to attend COP21 .\n\"Electric vehicles are a practical and affordable mode of transportation. At the same time, they offer a solution for drastically reducing tailpipe CO 2 emissions. They also reduce regulated exhaust pollutants, helping us to improve the air quality in our cities. Together, the public and private sectors can accelerate the transition to a zero-emission society,\" said Carlos Ghosn , Chairman and CEO of the Renault-Nissan Alliance.\nThe COP21 car fleet will feature the Renault ZOE subcompact car, the Nissan LEAF compact car and the 7-seater Nissan e-NV200 van. The vehicles will be available to shuttle delegates 24 hours, seven days a week to and from the Le Bourget conference venue, as a complement to public transportation.\nThis marks the first time the U.N. will use a zero-emission or 100% electric fleet for its entire passenger-car shuttle at a climate summit\n200 Renault and Nissan employees volunteer to drive at COP21\nThe 100% electric cars will be driven by a team of 200 professional drivers and 200 volunteers from Renault and Nissan. In June, the Renault-Nissan Alliance launched a call for volunteers to allow employees in and around Paris the opportunity to be part of COP21 as volunteer drivers. The response was overwhelming with more than 450 employees applying before the recruitment process was closed. The 200 successful Renault and Nissan applicants, as well as the professional drivers, will undergo a rigorous training program in preparation for the event.\nFor the entire press release please click here:\nhttp://www.media.blog.alliance-renault-nissan.com/news/5656\nContact : Rachel Konrad , Renault-Nissan Alliance Communications, rachel.konrad@renault-nissan.com ; Aline Henry , Renault-Nissan Alliance Communications, aline.henry@renault-nissan.com\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
