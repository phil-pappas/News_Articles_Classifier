It can accommodate up to 160 guests, is furnished with state-of-the-art audio-visual technology, and complements the newly renovated Tanjung Ria Kitchen restaurant, The Lounge and The Poolside Bar. The multipurpose layout of The Residence enables event organisers to use the facility for various purposes, ranging from small parties to entertainment dinners for important clients. The venue can also be combined with Tanjung Ria Kitchen restaurant for larger gatherings of up to 300 people. Bennett Peter, director of sales and marketing at the hotel said the new offering was necessary because “the hotel customer of today needs, demands and expects flexibility and versatility in experiences and service”. Arifin Darmawan, general manager of the Hyatt Regency Kinabalu, said: “Imagine you have been in a meeting room all day and when it’s time for a coffee break…the doors open and suddenly your meeting room is transformed into a show kitchen with chefs ready to serve you delicacies and beverages… all prepared right in front of you. Now that is a truly memorable meeting. “The new facility exudes an aura of elegance and relaxation with its contemporary yet classic décor, complemented by natural daylight window panels. With show kitchens and multiple rooms, the focus is on one-on-one guest engagement and personalising the entire hotel experience.” Peter added: “The launch of The Residence truly solidifies the position of the Hyatt Regency Kinabalu as being the landmark in the heart of downtown Kota Kinabalu for luxurious stays, exciting dining and memorable meetings.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:58:04.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
