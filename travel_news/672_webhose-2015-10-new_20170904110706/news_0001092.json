Since all cars and trucks are not created equal in the realm of insurance, some vehicles are less expensive to insure than others.\nMercury's research and development team recently examined the top 100 make/model combinations for the 2012 – 2015 model years to compile a list of the least expensive cars to insure. The list was created based on the Mercury price for full coverage – liability, comprehensive and collision – in California .\nHonda vehicles occupy three of the top four spots. Here is the complete top-10 list, beginning with the cheapest vehicle.\nHonda Fit – subcompact car Ford Fiesta – compact car Honda CR-V – crossover SUV Honda Pilot – crossover SUV MINI Countryman – premium compact car Ford Edge – crossover SUV Scion XB – wagon Mazda3 – compact car Hyundai Elantra – compact car Toyota Sienna – minivan \"There are many factors that go into calculating the cost to insure different vehicles, but the cost to repair them when they are damaged is at the top of the list,\" said Jim Reeves , Group Manager, R&D for Mercury Insurance. \"The vehicles on our list, led by the Honda Fit, are more than 10 percent cheaper to insure than the average of all cars and trucks insured by Mercury. These savings can help reduce the cost of ownership, so you should always consider what it will cost to insure your new car when you're shopping for the perfect vehicle.\"\nMercury boasts more than 1,200 independent agents in California and is the state's leading writer of automobile insurance in the independent agency channel.\n\"Many consumers don't think about the cost to insure a car before they buy it,\" said Larry Dominique , president of ALG. \"We heavily scrutinize data to determine a vehicle's future value, and car shoppers should take a close look at Mercury's list to see how insurance factors into the total cost of ownership and if one of these vehicles on the list is a good fit for their budget.\"\nBased on the price for full coverage, here are the top five most affordable vehicles (listed in order) to insure with Mercury in 2016 by body style.\nConvertible\nChrysler 200 FIAT 500 MINI Cooper Roadster Mazda MX-5 Miata Chevrolet Camaro Coupe\nMINI Cooper Honda Accord Kia Forte Honda Civic Nissan Altima Hatchback\nHonda Fit Scion IQ FIAT 500 Mazda3 Toyota Yaris Pickup Truck\nChevrolet Colorado GM Canyon GM Sierra C1500 Toyota Tacoma Chevrolet Silverado Sedan\nFord Fiesta Chevrolet Sonic Mazda3 Hyundai Elantra Honda Accord Crossover SUV\nHonda CR-V Honda Pilot Ford Edge Ford Escape Kia Sorento Van\nToyota Sienna Volkswagen Routan Dodge Grand Caravan Chrysler Town and Country Honda Odyssey *Other factors, such as a driver's experience and accident history, can push the rate up or down, but were not included in the rate calculations.\nABOUT MERCURY INSURANCE\nMercury Insurance (MCY) is a multiple-line insurance organization predominantly offering personal automobile, homeowners and commercial insurance through a network of independent agents in Arizona , California , Florida , Georgia , Illinois , Michigan , Nevada , New Jersey , New York , Oklahoma , Pennsylvania , Texas and Virginia .
