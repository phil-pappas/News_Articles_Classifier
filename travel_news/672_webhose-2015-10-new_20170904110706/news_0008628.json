The recent change reflects a largely improved security situation in Kenya, and while areas bordering Somalia remain under restriction, the main coast resort areas are now free from such prohibitive measures. \nContinued restrictions remain for the area between Kilifi County and Malindi going north, including the Tana River area. \nThe change has been long in coming, and Kenyan government sources have indicated that the lifting of anti-travel advisories against key resort areas along the coast was on the agenda when President Obama visited Kenya in July. \nMalindi can be reached by air from Nairobi’s two airports, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) and Wilson, and is also accessible by road from Mombasa and notably out of the Tsavo East National Park via the Sala Gate. The change means that US government personnel based in Kenya can now return to Malindi to enjoy the beaches and the various activities on offer including deep sea fishing for which this part of the Kenya coast is very famous since Ernest Hemingway’s days. \nPersonal visits by this correspondent both earlier in the year and more recently showed that Malindi had in fact been unfairly singled out and kept under anti-travel advisories after other parts of the coast had seen changes. Local tourism stakeholders and county officials gave reassurances that visits to Malindi were safe for tourists and that the resorts in the town and its outskirts are well protected.
