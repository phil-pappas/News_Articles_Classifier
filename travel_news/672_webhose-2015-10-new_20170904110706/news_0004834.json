(Photo: Demis Maryannakis/STAR MAX/IPx) New Yorkers – or should we say, New Yawkers – get a bad rap in America for their accents. But if you’re from the Bronx and down on your prospects, a recent study suggests you’ll find suitors across the pond in England. British Airways asked 1,000 England residents which American region has the sexiest accent, and New Yorkers finished in first place with one out of every four votes, scoring a massive upset over Southerners. Boston accents were deemed the most intelligent-sounding, and Chicagoans’ were found to be most unappealing, with just 4 percent of the vote. At least they still have Da Bears .

When Brits were asked who has the sexiest accent in America, first and second place went to Tennessee’s Morgan Freeman and Dolly Parton. The Brits may think New Yorkers are hot, but they’re unlikely to seek them out because only 20 percent of them could find New York on a map. Meanwhile, of the 1,000 Americans polled, 40 percent could find London on a map. Which does break some stereotypes about Americans and geography. Who do Americans think is the hottest? Glasgow, with such celebrities as Kelly Macdonald and James McAvoy, was found to have the sexiest British accent. As for the person with the sexiest accent, that title went to Edinburgh’s Sean Connery.
