Image: Supplied \nEAT OUT Sydney has many restaurants - but some of the best are hidden gems tucked away down secluded lanes where you would not expect to find dining at its best. One of these is Firedoor - a restaurant headed by world renowned chef Lennox Hastie. The unexpected restaurant is located on the back streets of Sydney's Surrey Hills and is housed within a historic building that gives it an edgy industrial feel. Inside, the space features an open kitchen, centered around two custom-made wood-fired ovens, four grills and an Aga cooker. The locavore menu is crafted daily, using the best seasonal produce, daily catch from the sea and the best livestock of the land. \nLP's Quality Meats is another beauty tucked away in Sydney's prospering neighbourhood of Chippendale. The family-friendly restaurant is home to the only \"South Pride Smoker\" in Australia, with the Tennessee made machine creating some of the best smoked and cured meats. The eatery is headed by accomplished chef Luke Powell, and is said to have been inspired by the Stone Barns restaurant in New York, where Powell once worked. The layout, waiters uniforms and general vibe of LP's at times feels more like a local pub than a glitzy restaurant and the meat raffle, held for customers each night, is the icing on the cake. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T19:50:28.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
