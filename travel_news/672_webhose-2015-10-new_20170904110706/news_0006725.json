Until fairly recently, Melbourne had Sydney beat on the cocktail front, its atmospheric lanes dotted with quirky and ambitious bars. But since a change in liquor licensing laws in 2008 that lessened the cost of opening a bar and led to a so-called small bar boom, Sydney has more than caught up.\n“Sydney has completely blasted it out of the water,” said Jason Crawley, an English bartender, consultant and entrepreneur in Australia since 2000, referring to Melbourne. “Sydney has about twice as many small bars now.”\nOnce you find the bars, you can choose your drinking fantasy, most of which have taken elements of American bar history as their inspiration. The Baxter Inn ( thebaxterinn.com ), secreted within a courtyard reached via a rather foreboding alley, and down some service stairs, is a warm, wooden tavern vaguely evocative of an old Boston pub. Hundreds of whiskey bottles (mainly Scotch) line the Everest-like back bar. There are a few cocktails, including a popular on-draft old-fashioned, which is served in a brandy snifter containing ice cubes and an orange twist, both huge. But most people here come for straight drams, which are also served in snifters.\nPhoto An old-fashioned at the Baxter Inn.

Here, the bar’s elusive rabbit hole hurtles you into a Southern-style honky-tonk where a beer and a shot are the call of the day and taxidermy is a synonym for décor.\nThe Lobo Plantation ( thelobo.com.au ) is across the street from the Baxter Inn. (Sydney cocktail bars are conveniently positioned in tight clusters of two or three.) It is a colorful, quasi-Cuban tiki dream in yet another subterranean space, with a wide array of rums. Cocktails include spins on drinks both new, such as the Penicilina, a tequila spin on the Penicillin, and old, like the creamy Toasted Almond Mai Tai. The latter is garnished with a marshmallow, charred by a frequently brandished blowtorch.\nPhoto A taxidermy snake adds to the décor at Shady Pines Saloon. Credit Paul van Kan The Prohibition era provides cues for bustling Palmer & Co . ( merivale.com.au/palmerandco ), with its vaulted brick ceilings, tiled floors and flapper-esque servers. As at many Australian cocktail bars, mixology artifacts are proudly displayed in cabinets and the soundtrack finds room for Frank, Dean, Ella and other American vocalists. Joe Redding’s Julep, a drink dating from the 1840s, compounds brandy, port and rum in one frosted silver cup. As a nightcap, it is a knockout, in both senses of the word.\n Nearby, no era or chunk of America is brought to mind by Bulletin Place ( bulletinplace.com ), which is up a flight from the sterile side street that gives the bar its name. The concise daily drinks list is written on a fat roll of butcher paper that hangs behind the bar. The bartending is serious, but the place is casual.\nCouples and groups fill the small room with chat while the mixologists bend fastidiously over their creations. Attention to detail and a relish in doing simple things well are earmarks of the Australian bartending style, and Bulletin Place’s bartenders are no exception.\nThe Mandtucket, a lush bourbon sour made with the juice of mandarin oranges, is indicative of a devotion to fresh local produce. Baxter Inn squeezes so many fresh green apples on the spot to make its simple “whiskey and apple” drink — a highball made of George Dickel No. 8 Tennessee whiskey and apple juice — that when I heard a rumor they had bought an orchard to meet their needs, I half believed it. Sadly, it’s not true, according to Anton Forte, an owner. “We have considered it,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/20/travel/20HEADSUP4/20HEADSUP4-blog427.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/20/travel/20HEADSUP4/20HEADSUP4-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/20/travel/20HEADSUP3/20HEADSUP3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://merivale.com.au/palmerandco", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/20/travel/20HEADSUP3/20HEADSUP3-articleLarge.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T14:35:59.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
