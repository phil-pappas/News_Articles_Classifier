He asks: How do I handle employee requests for time off before and over Christmas and the New Year? I can’t let everyone be absent at the same time as the business will suffer. Business expert Rachel Bridge replies: The legal position on this is fairly clear – employers are legally entitled to restrict when an employer takes holiday leave, for example at busy periods, and they can also tell their staff to take leave at certain times, for example at bank holidays or at Christmas. As a general rule both employers and employee must give the other side a notice period of at least twice as long as the leave being taken. If an employer is refusing a leave request, they must give as much notice as the amount of leave requested, for example two weeks’ notice if the leave requested was for two weeks. Beyond these legal guidelines, however, the key priority for an employer should be to ensure that they are acting fairly and consistently. If employees can see that everyone is being treated according to the same rules, they are less likely to feel resentful or grumpy if they don’t get the time off they want. If everyone wants to have the same days off, then one option might be to allow people to choose between having time off over Christmas or having time off over new year. Christmas Eve and new year’s eve tend to be the two days most hotly fought over. If your workforce is evenly split between those with young families and those without, this might work well as those with young families tend to prefer time off at Christmas and those without tend to prefer time off at new year. Another option might be to let the people who do not get their first choice at Christmas or new year to have priority when booking time off for their summer holiday. Wherever possible, you should try to act thoughtfully, too. Consider for example if it may be possible for those staff who are needed to work at festive times to be able to work from home for some or all of the time, or to perhaps do shorter hours on certain days. If your business activity is usually very quiet over the holiday season consider also closing the office altogether and even giving staff an extra few days of holiday between Christmas and the new year without having to dip into their annual leave entitlement. It would be a generous gesture on your behalf, but one that is likely to reap huge amounts of loyalty and appreciation from your employees that will last long after the holiday season is over. Stuart Skinner, director of PR and business development at PHA Media, adds: It was mid-March when I received the first request for time off over Christmas this year and the floodgates opened soon after. Christmas is a time like no other, when employees want to confirm travel plans and return to their families, so putting a fair plan in place well in advance is vital. I collate requests from staff for their ideal dates off and try to accommodate everyone’s wishes, while still maintaining a minimum level of resource in the office. Surprisingly, this usually works out because people have often used most if not all of their annual holiday allowance already and also they are willing to compromise and keen not to leave the team exposed. Even so, there are the inevitable busy days that everyone wants to book off, Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, for example; but, as long as staff are available to work remotely, and clients are informed in advance of our plans, it is possible to operate on a lower resource level on these occasional days. • One way to ensure you keep feeling festive is with the right comapny car financed the best way for your business.
