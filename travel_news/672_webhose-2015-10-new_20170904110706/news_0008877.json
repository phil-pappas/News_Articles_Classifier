IIPT honours peace, women, and big student presence at massive Maharashtra International Travel Mart Two major knowledge sessions at the inaugural Maharashtra International Travel Mart involved peace and women - both revolved around powerful females.The first showcased Mrs Kia Sherr's peace initiative. This determined and resourceful woman, struggling to come to terms with her husband and daughter's death at the hands of terrorists in the Mumbai attack of 2008, set up the One Life Alliance to confront violence and terrorism.The second session dealt with empowered women in tourism - and there were certainly enough to go around, including Rika Jean Francois of the world's biggest travel fair - ITB and Messe Berlin, Archana Tomer founder of Mountain People - a global charity embracing and empowering local communities and young mother Michelle Kakade the only Indian woman to have completed marathons in four deserts - who outlined her plans to run thousands of miles around India in months of unique challenge.There was even an unusual Miss India and Miss World runner-up, Parvathy Omanakuttan, who wants to make the travel industry more humane and sustainable and authentic.There were, of course a few token males helping to moderate the events including Dr. Patrick Kalifungwa, ex Minister for Tourism & Industry, Govt. of Zambia & Vice Chancellor of the Livingstone International University of Excellence in Tourism and Business Management, Lusaka, and the president of the International Institute for Peace through Tourism (IIPT) and CEO of Nomad Travels - Ajay Prakash.But these were only the warm-ups for the evening celebrations of womens' contribution to tourism and peace organized by IIPT.There were presentations from Maharashtra's female Chief Secretary of Tourism and Culture Smt.
