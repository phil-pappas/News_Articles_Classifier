I was the mother of two children under two who did not sleep. I was tired, stressed and felt like I hadn’t sat down in years. Of course I needed a holiday. But when you are so sleep-deprived that even a trip to the Big Tesco is a major operation, the mere thought of a holiday can be terrifying. “The sea air will help the baby sleep,” they said. “All the excitement will tire the kids out,”’ people assured me. Enticed by the promise of a good night’s sleep, I decided to bite the bullet and go for it. This was not a holiday. We were just doing the same old stuff in a prettier location. @stolensleep Three months later, I was crying into a cream tea somewhere on the East Coast of Devon and cursing those people. They were liars. My baby was immune to the soporific powers of the ocean breeze, and all the excitement just made our toddler want to stay awake all night. This was not a holiday. We were just doing the same old stuff in a prettier location. What we did As much as possible with our Two Under Two, my husband and I were trying to do everything we did at home, under the impression that it would make our trip easier. We even attempted to stick to our Consistent Bedtime Routine, fearing that straying from it we would Ruin Our Children Forever. Then there was the added pressure to ensure everyone had a Good Time. It was a holiday ; it cost a lot of money, so we were determined to enjoy ourselves, tired or not! • Is a holiday with children actually a holiday at all? • The best family holiday is one where you leave the children at home Trying to create the perfect family vacation is not easy when you are sleep deprived. In spite of our fatigue, we dragged the kids to sandy beaches, funfairs and parks in the summer heat wave, determined that they would have fun. They did not. Clearly tired and sensing our stress, they grumbled, cried and seemed to hate the sun, the sea, the sand and everything else in between. By day four, we felt even more exhausted than we did at home - which was already bad enough - rendering the whole purpose of the trip pointless. On that fourth night, as I walked the creaky floors of our rented cottage at 4am, trying to settle my baby to sleep, I reached the type of semi-conscious exhaustion that can lead to an epiphany. It was this: Bedtime can get lost. The routine can take a running jump. Consistency can do one. I am going to take a break from all of it! What we should have done We spent the remainder of our week away doing nothing much at all. We sat around in our pyjamas, ate cream teas for breakfast and had dinner in the local pub. We sacked off the bath and bedtime routine and drank cold beer on the seafront instead, while the toddler happily played with the pebbles (throwing them at us) and a bucket of water (throwing it over herself) and the baby sucked her toes. It was bliss. We were still tired from tending to our sleep-hating offspring all night, but we were happy, the children were happy, and it finally felt like a break. We sacked off the bath and bedtime routine and drank cold beer on the seafront instead, while the toddler played with pebbles and the baby sucked her toes. @stolensleep As parents we spend most of our time following the rules - the ones we set ourselves in the hope that they will ensure our children are happy, healthy and turn into decent human beings. We are constantly sticking to schedules and striving to be the perfect parents - and it is exhausting! So isn’t it OK to want a bit of down time? Going away with young children is always going to be tiring. It is never going to be hassle-free or particularly relaxing, but it should be a break. So ditch the routine, let the kids stay up late, parent like no one is watching (or judging) and enjoy some guilt-free family time. Emily-Jane Clark is a mother of two.
