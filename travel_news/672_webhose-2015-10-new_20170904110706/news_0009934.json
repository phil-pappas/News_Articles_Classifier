Such an upheaval requires a different approach to financial planning and the best results are achieved by talking to an adviser about the family’s requirements rather than just the individual's. According to research carried out by Old Mutual Wealth before the April reforms, two-thirds of current retirees had converted their pension savings into an annuity. Now the changes have been enacted, just 16pc of those approaching retirement who will have the option to purchase an annuity will do so initially. The amount charged by a financial adviser can easily be recouped by avoiding unnecessary taxes While retirees have much greater freedom over the use of their pension pot, they need to ensure it is used in the most effective manner. It’s best to see an adviser who can look at all your financial assets as well as discussing how to use the accumulated wealth during retirement and after death. Richard Bartlett, the head of auto-enrolment and at-retirement at Intrinsic Financial Services, part of Old Mutual Wealth, says: “A good financial adviser will not only consider the individual’s needs but also look at providing financial planning for the spouse and children.” An important consideration is how long the retiree is expected to live. It’s possible to estimate longevity by using tools taking account of gender and health. Mr Bartlett says: “We also consider their income and capital requirements along with any desire to pass money to the next generation.” Effective financial planning will give peace of mind to the whole family Tax efficiency is vital. Now that a pension pot can be passed on to any beneficiaries tax-free if the retiree dies before 75 and at a much reduced rate of tax after that age, it could be more effective to use the pension pot to transfer wealth to the next generation. Mr Bartlett adds: “It might better for some individuals to use equity release to provide their income rather than their pension pot.” Old Mutual Wealth’s research shows that while most pensioners own their house only 2pc use equity release in retirement. To ensure the most effective plan, it’s best to involve all those affected by these decisions in the discussions. Mr Bartlett says: “The needs of the family members also must be considered.” A financial adviser will also ensure you are using those products which enable wealth to be inherited. They will also give advice about the most effective ways to transfer money, making full use of the rules surrounding gifting and tapering. Mr Bartlett says: “The amount charged by a financial adviser can easily be recouped by avoiding unnecessary taxes. Effective financial planning will give peace of mind to the whole family.” You may also be interested in: • Six questions to ask your pension adviser • The new shape of retirement • Balancing pensions against retirement income", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:47:09.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
