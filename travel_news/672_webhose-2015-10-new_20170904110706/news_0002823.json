These include Goodwood Members Meeting, Three Friday Nights, Festival of Speed, Qatar Goodwood Festival, and the Goodwood Revival. In order to fulfil the contract Qdos has invested more than £500k in new units, all incorporating a sleek modern contemporary design. The business has also added to its operations team and will soon be relocating to larger premises in Beaconsfield to accommodate all of the new Qdos equipment. The Festival of Speed is one of the largest events that the contract covers. In 2015 Qdos installed some 400 units including 80 event cabins; 90 containers; 40 shower pods; 80 jack leg toilet blocks, in a combination of male, female and disabled and over 100 plastic toilets. In addition Qdos supplied and managed a range of added value services to complement their product range, this included carpenters to build and install over 80 purpose built access steps and ramps, cladding to finish and dress units, daily toilet servicing and LPG Gas for showers. Commenting on their appointment James Thomas, Qdos’ Commercial Director, who oversees the Goodwood account said: “This is a prestigious and important contract for Qdos. Not only do we now supply to some of the UK’s most recognisable and well-loved events but the sheer scale and scope of the agreement has enabled us to invest in more kit and staff.” Nigel Brice, Divisional CEO at Newship Group, Qdos’ parent company added: “Securing a five year contract with Goodwood is a great achievement, capping another very successful year for the team at Qdos”. Goodwood’s Dan Garlick, Goodwood Festival of Speed General Manager: “We were really keen to find a reliable supplier with quality products that we could build a long term working relationship with. Qdos has an extensive range of products and being able to source multiple items from one supplier is an added benefit. The Qdos team has been onsite at Goodwood since our Members’ event back in March and I’m really pleased with how things have progressed. The kit is in very good condition and well maintained, this coupled with excellent customer service and a can-do attitude makes for a job well done.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:50:38.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
