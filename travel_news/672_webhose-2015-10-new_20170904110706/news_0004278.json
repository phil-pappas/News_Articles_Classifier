[...] because I’m riding a bike along with a group of other cyclists, the scenery doesn’t whiz by as quickly, and we stop to wander among the puzzle-piece-shaped rock formations that frame the flora by its small curved pockets. The Burren makes up part of the Wild Atlantic Way — Ireland’s first long-distance touring route, stretching along the Atlantic coast from Donegal in the north to West Cork in the south. While I’m not tackling the entire route on this guided cycling trip, the pace allows me to pass through small towns and stop at cafes that let me see into the culture in a way I’d probably be too hurried to notice fully if we were on four wheels. Perhaps my awareness is heightened by this slower method of transportation, but it seems that bikes punctuate the scenery of this entire countryside. “To be Irish, I think you must also have a certain love of bicycles,” says a bartender, who sees me eyeing the metal circus of countless bikes leaning at odd angles on the pub’s outer wall. The gross and net result of it is that people who spend most of their natural lives riding iron bicycles over the rocky roadsteads of this parish get their personalities mixed up with the personalities of their bicycle as a result of the interchanging of the atoms of each of them and you would be surprised at the number of people in these parts who nearly are half people and half bicycle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:46:18.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
