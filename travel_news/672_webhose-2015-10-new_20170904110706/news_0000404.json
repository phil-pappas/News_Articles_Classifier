A part of the temple is now being run on solar power – a move the Delhi government must consider for other monuments in the national Capital, according to a newsitem in The Hindu. \nThe temple, which utilises around 500 kilowatt of power in total, generates 120 KW on its own. Besides, it is the first major public site in Delhi to have installed a “net metre”. This has made the temple the first in the city to be a part of the Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (DERC) “Net Metering” regulations. Members of the Lotus Temple (M/s National Spiritual Assembly) said the move had helped them save around Rs 120000 as electricity bills every month. \nJai Prakash (Service Manager of the Baha’i House of Worship) said that the move was to keep the “essence” of the temple intact. “We are happy that we took the decision to shift to solar power. After all, we are all the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch,” Mr. Prakash said. \nThe temple has installed more than 400 photo-voltaic panels, each of which produces around 250 watts. The power so generated is being used for lighting and even cooking purposes.
