A growing number of people over 50 are starting up a business for the first time after realising that they have many of the skills and experience they need to make it a success. Dubbed olderpreneurs, first-time entrepreneurs over the age of 50 are benefiting not only from the life skills they have amassed during a career spanning many years in the workplace. They are also making the most of the possibilities opened up by the internet, which means that businesses can increasingly be started in a small but effective way, and run from home. According to the Office for National Statistics, there are now nearly 1.8 million self-employed people over the age of 50, an increase of 21 per cent on 2008. Indeed around one in five people aged over 50 is self-employed, a higher proportion than for any other age group. There is an increasing amount of support and visibility available for older entrepreneurs The businesses being started by olderpreneurs cover a wide range of areas from printing to tea shops to theatre. And contrary to expectations, many are also being started up in the newer areas of technology and communications. Older people have several advantages over younger people when starting up a business. They are likely to have chalked up many years of work experience, have more skills, knowledge and contacts to draw on, and may have the confidence to guide them through the tough times that a younger person may not have. They may also have more money available to invest in getting their business off the ground, particularly if they have left a career with a lump sum redundancy payment. Indeed, statistics shows that older entrepreneurs tend to be more successful than those starting out younger. According to a survey by Age UK, the charity for older people, more than 70pc of businesses started by people in their fifties survive for at least five years whereas only 28pc of those started by younger people last that long. With older people typically finding it hard to get paid employment in the workplace and career opportunities becoming more limited, it makes a lot of sense to encourage more over-50s to start their own businesses. Despite this, most of the focus so far by government and other organisations has been on encouraging younger people to start businesses. The good news is that there is an increasing amount of support and visibility available for older entrepreneurs, too. The Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise, Prime , for example, is a charity set up by the Prince of Wales to support the over-50s start businesses of their own, and provides advice and access to loans. Some further education colleges also run courses specifically aimed at first time entrepreneurs over 50. John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, says: “You are never too old to start a business. Our latest member survey found that well over a tenth our members (13pc) were over the age of 65, and nearly 10pc of those owned business under five years old. “For those aged between 55 and 64, nearly 20pc ran businesses under five years old. We are seeing a growing trend for older entrepreneurs as people choose to take greater control of their work in later life.” He adds: “Unfortunately, older business owners can experience particular challenges, such as securing adequate finance to grow their business. It is important we work to overcome these issues as, with the UK’s ageing population, we need an economy which allows people of all ages the opportunity to create something new and exciting.” • Whatever age you are when you decide to launch your business, a smart move is to find the right company car financed in the best way.
