On a sweltering and elongated day on the North Course, Healey picked up two birdies in the opening three holes with precision ball striking before the England under-18 squad member settled for a one-under par score. “It is a small field but so strong,” said the West Lancashire member. She will be joined in the leaders’ group by Olivia Mehaffey, the world No 16 amateur player, who shot the same score. The two know each other after playing junior tournaments such as the Wee Wonders' US Kids Championship. A rising star of Northern Irish golf, Mehaffey recorded five birdies, but a devilish pin position on the 6th coupled with a bunkered approach shot left her with a double bogey. Chloe Howard sits in third, five shots back. In the boys’ event, Jamie Li had a similar mid-round blip when he hit two drives out of bounds on consecutive holes, but recovered to shoot 71 and take a two-shot lead overnight. Li, who has finished at Millfield School and occasionally works at his father’s Chinese takeaway business near Bath, is a two-time Telegraph finalist at Quinta do Lago and hopes to finish his junior career here with victory. \"I'll have to keep the mistakes out now,\" he said. Li, below, was followed by a trio of hard-working 73’s from 14-year-old Barclay Brown, following in the footsteps of fellow Hallamshire member Matthew Fitzpatrick, Stoke Park’s John Gough and Daniel List, who plays at Wentworth. However, eight players lie within four shots of Li's score. Callum Farr, watched by a seven-strong family gathering, was almost matching Li until the last when a lengthy ruling forced the Priors Hall member to take a drop after a wayward drive and suffer a cruel double bogey. In all, it was a trying day for the 21 finalists. Several players are playing abroad for the first time here, but have racked up a wealth of experience in the process by playing alongside some of the best in British junior golf. Meanwhile, for several players still in contention for the two titles, the Telegraph finals will represent not only their final event of the season, but also their final rounds as juniors. There is still much at stake.
