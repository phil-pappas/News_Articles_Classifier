The Jamstik+ is a digital guitar that goes anywhere. (Zivix) Ross Werland Tribune Newspapers Need a guitar for the road? Here's a portable. \nName: Jamstik+ \nWhat it is: A portable \"smart guitar\" that will let a traveler practice or simply enjoy playing guitar on the road without adding much to luggage or disturbing the hotel guest next door. The Jamstik+ is basically the fretboard of a guitar. Although providing only five frets, it does allow push-button access to different ranges. The device works with iOS devices via Bluetooth that mates easily. The controller app and two lesson programs are available free. The manufacturer suggests using earphones or speakers that attach via cord to the Apple source, such as an iPad, lest there be any delay between plucking the string and hearing the sound. It also can play numerous sounds, such as a 12-string, electric guitar or sitar. It is battery-operated, so you don't need a power source all the time; the maker says the battery will last 10 hours. \nThe good: This is a delight for guitarist wannabes like me. I do have a guitar, but this is the next best thing to a live teacher, which you likely will want at some point if you're at all serious about becoming the next Doc Watson. The lessons include rudimentary drills that will help you with such skills as being able to locate the correct strings without looking. Then they move on to chords, at which point you will be able to at least accompany yourself singing. My wife really appreciates the fact that I can use earphones, sparing her the labor pains of my ascendant guitar career. If you're serious about practice, you will want to keep this with you at all times simply to fill empty minutes by doing something useful. It takes very little space, being only a little longer than a typical adult forearm. \nThe bad: It comes with a shoulder strap, but there is nothing like the feel of embracing an actual guitar and feeling its vibes through your skin. This will never replace that, but it's not trying to. \nCost: $299.99", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:09:00.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
