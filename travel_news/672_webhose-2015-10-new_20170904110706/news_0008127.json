The Gamble Mansion near Sarasota is a piece of Civil War history. (Bonnie Gross / Courtesy) Bonnie Gross FloridaRambler.com Visit the Gamble Mansion, the only antebellum mansion outside North Florida \nTwo miles off I-75, the Gamble Mansion has white columns to rival Tara and was the site of a dramatic Civil War event. \nIt's easy to forget we live in the former Confederacy – South and Central Florida don't seem very Southern any more. That's why this, the only Florida antebellum mansion left outside North Florida, makes such an interesting stop. \nIt's located near Sarasota, minutes south of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge to St. Petersburg. \nTo go inside the house, you must take a guided tour, offered for $6 at 9:30 a.m. 10:30 a.m., 1, 2, 3 and 4 p.m. from Thursdays to Mondays. (The visitor center is closed and there are no tours on Tuesday and Wednesday.) \nThe mansion was built in 1844 and has survived wars, hurricanes and tropical humidity – but just barely. After being used to store fertilizer, it sat vacant in the 1920s, decaying away. The United Daughters of the Confederacy came to its rescue, purchasing it and deeding it to the state.

Picnic tables are situated under the trees and a small museum tells the Gamble Mansion history and exhibits a few Civil War objects. (There's no fee to visit the grounds or museum.) \nThe Gamble Mansion was built shortly after the Second Seminole War ended, opening the area for settlement. Robert Gamble, a major during the war, built a sugar plantation on the Little Manatee River, starting in 1844. He was a bachelor, and yet he built a lavish 10-room two-story mansion. Its tabby walls are nearly 2 feet thick and it has wide shaded verandas wrapping around three sides of the house. \nAll the labor was done by slaves, including digging 16 miles of canals, necessary to grow sugar. Records show that in 1847, Gamble owned 70 slaves and by 1855, that number had increased to 151. No slave quarters remain. \nGamble lived there and operated the plantation for 12 years. Deeply in debt, Gamble was forced to sell it and his slaves in 1856 after sugar prices sank. \nThe museum today is furnished with period items, though none are original to the house. \nThe story that makes the Gamble Mansion famous, though, is its role in 1865 just after the Confederate surrender. The secretary of state for the Confederacy was Judah Philip Benjamin, a prominent Jew, a New Orleans plantation owner and a trusted confidante of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. \nAfter surrender, there was a $40,000 reward for his capture. Traveling in disguise, he made his way south, staying at homes of Confederate supporters until he reached Gamble Mansion, then the home of Archibald McNeil, a famous blockade runner. With McNeil's help, he stole away on a boat to Bimini and on to London, where he was an immediate success as a barrister. \nGamble Plantation Historic Park is at 3708 Patten Ave., Ellenton; 942-723-4536, floridastateparks.org/park/Gamble-Plantation \nBonnie Gross gives tips on visiting the natural and authentic Florida at www.FloridaRambler.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:55:08.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
