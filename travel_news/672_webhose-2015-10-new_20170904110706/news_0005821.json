The state is teeming with natural beauty, from lakes to mountains to breathtaking scenic drives. \nHere are just a few of the top natural attractions that are worthy additions to any travel itinerary. \nGrand Lake Area \nThe Serpentine Grand Lake area offers 1,300 miles of shoreline and over 46,500 acres of stunning scenery. Five state parks surround the lake, offering ample opportunity for camping, hiking and a host of other recreational activities. If you love the outdoors and all the activities borne of it, this spot will not disappoint. \nRobbers Cave State Park \nBesides its stunning scenery, this park is famous for being a hideout of famous outlaws Jesse James and Belle Starr. Located in hilly woodlands, it is particularly well-known for its horseback riding trails, rappelling, and hiking. If the season is right, you can partake in trout fishing, or view the colorful fall foliage. The park is more than 8,200 acres, and 189 combined lake acres. For the serious hiker, you can take the journey to the outlaw cave, hidden amongst sandstone hills and rugged cliffs. \nGlover River \nIf you like natural attractions a bit off the beaten path, Glover River may be a good choice for your Oklahoma vacation. Untamed and non-commercial, this pristine body of water is a great choice for floaters looking for a bit of solitude. Nearby cabins usually offer up a canoe with rental. This river journey is best for people experienced with navigating unpredictable waters, and knowledgeable about the topography of the area. \nTurner Falls Park \nTurner Falls Park is the oldest in the state, and named after Mazeppa Thomas Turner, who discovered the 77-foot waterfall that resides here—the largest in Oklahoma. The park is located in the famous Arbuckle Mountains region, known for its stunning natural beauty, and interesting geological formations. In fact, the area is often compared to the Grand Canyon and Black Hills. There is plenty to keep you busy at Turner Falls, from hikes among gorgeous trails to exploring the myriad caves. There are plenty of cabins in the area, as well as sites for camping and RVs. \nThere is a lot more in this surrounding area, which is one of the most popular tourist regions in the state. Chickasawcountry.com is a great resource for information about the park and other attractions. \nBlack Mesa State Park and Nature Preserve \nBlack Mesa is home to the state’s highest point, and with the view you’ll get from here, make sure not to forget your camera! The park’s name comes from the fact it was covered in a layer of black lava more than 30 million years ago. It is home to a 1,600 acre nature preserve that is home to rare plants and wildlife. It is a particularly popular spot for birders, and because it is home to one of the darkest skies in the country—that is publicly accessible anyway—it is the perfect spot for astronomy enthusiasts, particularly in August, when you can see the annual Perseid meteor shower. \nWichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge \nThis refuge is more than 59,000 acres, and here you can find all sorts of free range animals, such as elk, deer, prairie dogs, buffalo, and Texas longhorn cattle. If you are particularly keen on nature photography, or live for scenic hikes, this is the place to be. Here you can also partake in rock climbing, mountain biking, fishing and rappelling. If you like a bit of learning with your nature, be sure to check out the Visitor Center which features exhibits on the animals and habitats of the area. There are also guided tours available. \nThis is just a small sampling of the natural wonders dotted through the beautiful state of Oklahoma. No matter where you go, you will surely be satisfied with the experience; you will connect with nature, and get some stunning photos in the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:21:08.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
