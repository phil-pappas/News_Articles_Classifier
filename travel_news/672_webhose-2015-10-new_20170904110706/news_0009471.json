We are in a hurry to open up the other line as soon as possible.\" \nFor Sintayehu, the best part was the cooperation between the governments and the citizens: \"The railway project came into the picture just after 100 years.\" \nThe energy used for the metro service is generated from big dams, located all over the country: \"We do not share the power from the city of Addis and also we will not have continuous interruptions or power shortage problems\" adds Sintayehu. \nThe initial stage of the operation is being overseen by the Chinese company Shenzen, as an exchange of skills and culture between Chinese and Ethiopian workers. \nOnce completed, the light rail will connect up with the national train system of Ethiopia, and by 2025 there will be 5 thousand kilometers of track across the whole of the country. \nThe long term goal is not just to connect Ethiopia, but to see the country connected to Djibouti, Sudan and Gabon. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
