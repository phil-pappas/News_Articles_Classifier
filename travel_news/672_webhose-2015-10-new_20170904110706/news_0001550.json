This longhouse is part of the museum. Equally as impressive as the Ede longhouses, the tall houses of the Bahnar and Giarai are the most iconic sights of Vietnam's Central Highlands.\nThe moment you step into a Bahnar or Giarai village, your eyes are attracted to the rong, or towering communal house, which sits at the heart of every village and can reach up to 30 meters in height, though most are around 15 to 20 meters.\nThe taller the rong, the greater the status of the village.\nThe towering structures are built on stilts, and are accessed, as with the Ede longhouses, by sloping logs with steps cut into them.\nInteriors consist of a bamboo platform big enough to accommodate all the villagers.\nThatched roofs are pitched at a seemingly impossible angle, and it's evident that those who build them must have a good head for heights.\nThe peak of the blade-shaped roof is decorated with a distinctive pattern that's different for each village.\nThe rong is the focus of village life.\nIt's used for meetings, solving judicial disputes and for the many Bahnar ceremonies and festivals, at which the locals wear their tribal outfits, play gongs and sing.\nThe most important of these ceremonies is a buffalo sacrifice, which may be gruesome to Western eyes, but fulfills an important role in community bonding.\nLike the Bahnar, the Giarai sacrifice buffalo on important occasions, one of which is to say farewell to departed relatives.\nGiarai's elaborated tombs\nMost Vietnamese practice ancestor worship, but none more intensely than the Giarai, for whom a funeral is a complex and expensive business.\nMost Giarai villages have a graveyard to the west, which is divided into fenced-off family plots, with family members being buried in the same tomb.\nPrized possessions such as a TV or bicycle may be laid to rest with the dead, and simple wooden carvings of figures in a variety of moods -- pensive, glum, cheerful or sexually aroused -- are placed on the boundary of the grave.\nAfter the buffalo sacrifice in honor of the deceased relative, the grave is abandoned and the site is reclaimed by nature.\nIt's best to visit a Giarai graveyard in the company of a local guide.\nOne of the best is Nguyen Do Huynh, a knowledgeable Bahnar man who works at the Kon Tum Travel Service Center.\nThe Bahnar and Giarai live mostly in the provinces north of Dak Lak -- Gia Lai and Kon Tum.\nThe town of Kon Tum is surrounded by villages with rong and it's sometimes possible for visitors to stay overnight in these fantastic structures.\nHowever, the Vietnamese authorities only opened up the Central Highlands to foreign visitors in 1993 and it's not easy to go off the beaten track.\nWhile there's no finer way of seeing the long, tall and dead houses of the Central Highlands than by going there, you can also see well-constructed versions of each type at the Museum of Ethnology in Hanoi .\nBahnar guide Nguyen Do Huynh can be contacted at huynhguide@yahoo.com.\nVietnam Museum of Ethnology , Nguyen Van Huyen road, Cau Giay district Nghia Do, Cau Giay, Hanoi Vietnam;", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013132022-central-vietnam-3-e-de-longhouse-museum-ethnology-hanoi-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013132022-central-vietnam-3-e-de-longhouse-museum-ethnology-hanoi-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013132022-central-vietnam-3-e-de-longhouse-museum-ethnology-hanoi-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013132022-central-vietnam-3-e-de-longhouse-museum-ethnology-hanoi-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293924-d447352-Reviews-m14631-Vietnam_Museum_of_Ethnology-Hanoi.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013132022-central-vietnam-3-e-de-longhouse-museum-ethnology-hanoi-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013132022-central-vietnam-3-e-de-longhouse-museum-ethnology-hanoi-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013132022-central-vietnam-3-e-de-longhouse-museum-ethnology-hanoi-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://www.vme.org.vn/home/"], "published": "2015-10-14T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:42:49.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
