The first of its kind in Vail Village, this classic American barber shop offers a variety of traditional and cutting-edge grooming services, complete with local craft brews and liquors served up with each treatment. Welcoming locals and visitors alike, The Barber Shop is located in a private room within the Resort’s Forbes 5-Star rated Spa, and features a unique “man cave-esque” décor furnished with masculine tones, dark wood floors and custom cabinetry. Retro barber art and a host of men’s magazines, along with an old-fashioned Collins barber chair and a classic American Marvy barber pole complement the distinctive design.\nThe Barber Shop’s services range from a classic straight edge razor shave and moustache trim to Moroccan oil scalp massages and various hair cut services, deemed A Cut & A Cold One. A custom men’s skin and hair care line, Eufora Hero, is used throughout all treatments, with products specially formulated to address men’s skin, scalp and hair health. Included with each service are local libations of choice, such as craft beer from Crazy Mountain Brewery or barrel-aged 10th Mountain Whiskey and Spirit Bourbon.\n“The Spa’s salon has been very successful in attracting female clientele for hair and nail services, but we wanted to create a venue that specifically catered to our male guests as well,” says Mark Herron, General Manager, Four Seasons Resort and Residences Vail. “The Barber Shop is the only men’s salon like it in the Valley offering custom service and 5-star amenities served up with local brews and craft liquors.”\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:50:26.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
