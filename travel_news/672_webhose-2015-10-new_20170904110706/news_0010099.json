It's the middle of rush hour and there's traffic all around. You're late for work and there's no chance you'll get your car running again without help. You call the AA, and a reassuring voice tells you that a patrol will be there soon. The tension eases, but you start to feel unwell. There's a tightening in your chest, and you’re short of breath. When the AA technician arrives, your car's blocked diesel particulate filter is the last thing on your mind. Far more worrying is the acute pressure gathering in your chest, the aching that seems to engulf your entire body and the cold sweat that's covering your greying flesh. It's sobering to think what could have happened had I not been there But this technician has a calm head. He spots that something's not right and realises that you need medical attention, urgently. So he drives you to the nearest hospital, checks you into A&E, and only then returns to recover your stricken car. Some time later, the technician learns that you were having a massive heart attack, and that his actions almost certainly saved your life. Bet you're pleased you joined the AA, aren't you? The incident has an impact on the technician, too. \"I get goose bumps when I think about it,\" says Steve Wadsworth, who has worked for the AA since 2011 and was quick to offer help when he responded to a call just like this last winter. \"I don’t think I did anything special, but it's sobering to think what could have happened had I not been there.\" Fortunately, Mr Wadsworth's AA training ensures he always pays careful attention to the people involved in a breakdown before turning his sights on their vehicle. It’s about a lot more than repairing broken-down motors \"That way we can make sure they're doing OK in a situation that is often extremely stressful.\" This personal approach to the job is one of its great joys, according to Mr Wadsworth. \"I love this work,\" he says. \"It’s about a lot more than repairing broken-down motors. It's also about building relationships, offering reassurance and going the extra mile to look after customers.\" Sometimes, that involves picking up the pieces in the event of a crisis. Like the time that he was called to the aftermath of an accident, in which a car had nose-dived down an eight-foot drop. \"I was pleased to be on hand to offer advice about the recovery, which required specialist lifting equipment,\" Mr Wadsworth says. \"This gives an indication of the variety of situations we're called out to deal with.\" As it happens, this is another aspect of working for the AA that Mr Wadsworth relishes. \"It’s a cliché to say it, but no two days are ever the same. And while dealing with medical emergencies like heart attacks is a fairly rare occurrence, it's great to think you can make a difference when they do come up.\" Find out more about the AA's breakdown recovery services at theaa.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:52:39.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
