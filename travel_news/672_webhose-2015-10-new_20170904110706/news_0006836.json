Rail systems in different sections of the region tend to have grossly different characteristics, even though they are subject to similar environments. Clearly, several social, economic, political and technological factors determine which rail systems are patronised.\nThe new excel-based study from Frost & Sullivan, Strategic Dashboard of Investment in Rail Infrastructure and Rolling Stock in Europe 2014–2020 ( http://www.frost.com/mb28 ), is a complete database that can be used for analysis, forecasts and the development of strategies. The database is organised by country, railway company, infrastructure project, rolling stock original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and model. Clients can analyse data by parameters such as country, age of service, application, OEM and project type. The study covers 40 countries, 456 projects, 604 rail operators and 75,250 rolling stocks.\nFor complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://bit.ly/1fB38xO .\n\"While all 456 projects, with a total budget of €341.04 billion, are in various stages of completion, they are scheduled to come to a close by 2020,\" said Frost & Sullivan Automotive & Transportation Senior Research Analyst Shyam Raman . \"Considering factors such as the state of the European economy, political stability and availability of funds, the service addressable market is estimated to be €194.26 billion.\"\nNew business models that provide turnkey solutions have accelerated the time to market of infrastructure and rolling stock projects. In the United Kingdom , for instance, the Thameslink Programme, which was launched in 2014, will be completed by 2018. The High Speed 2 Phase 1 project, however, will commence in 2017 and reach fruition only by 2026.\n\"Due to strong governmental support, a large number of rolling stock operators across Europe are working on boosting the existing infrastructure,\" noted Raman. \"Northern Rail ( www.northernrail.org ) and CargoServ ( www.cargoserv.at ) are among the companies looking to do just this.\"\nStrategic Dashboard of Investment in Rail Infrastructure and Rolling Stock in Europe 2014–2020 (MB28-13) is an invaluable tool market participants can use to assess rail growth prospects in Europe up to 2020 by segment. The study is part of the Transportation & Logistics ( http://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation ) Growth Partnership Service program from Frost & Sullivan.
