The display is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) with pictures, descriptions of the hotels, their rates and amenities, a map with client offices or their client locations, and customer ratings, among other relevant items. In addition, the Hotel Intuition platform allows for greater customization in hotel searches as it takes into account the customer’s preferred hotels and corporate rates as well as the hotel preferences of the individual traveler.\n \n \n \nPrior to the development of this platform, consultants working in the reservation system would only have access to the traditional, limited hotel information available in the GDS. This included descriptions of available hotel rates without much ability to modify the search to the customers’ and travelers’ preferences. The consultants would then be required to enter additional commands and access other sources to view more relevant hotel data. Using Hotel Intuition will enhance consultants’ ability to make efficient hotel reservations within their customer’s corporate travel policy.\n \n \n \nHotel Intuition will also help improve the customer experience in booking hotels. The additional options and more relevant hotel information will help travelers and consultants make more informed decisions and feel comfortable with their hotel reservations at the point of booking.\n \n \n \nThese added search capabilities and increased comfort level of the travelers could help reduce the number of hotel stays travelers book outside of the travel management companies’ provided methods, an act that damages a company’s leverage when negotiating preferred rates with hotels. Increasing hotel booking within the customer’s corporate policy is also a key component of the Duty of Care and traveler safety responsibilities travel management companies share with their clients.\n \n \n \nAccording to Adelman Travel Chief Information Officer Ivan Imana, this boost in the reservation process and customer satisfaction is what drove Adelman to develop Hotel Intuition.\n \n \n \n“This is the next phase of improving the travel consultants’ ability to help their travelers,” Imana said. “These enriched tools are able to give them access to much more relevant data right at their fingertips. The additional hotel information will be a huge benefit to the traveler while making the reservations process easier and quicker for travel consultants as well.”\n \n \n \n“Adelman Travel and GetGoing both share a passion for improving the traveler experience. This partnership will bring cutting-edge consumer hotel shopping and booking technology to Adelman’s travel consultants,” said Alek Vernitsky, the CEO and co-founder of GetGoing, Inc. “Adelman Travel provides us with a strong partner to improve the travel shopping experience for millions of travelers. We are excited to have Adelman on the GetGoing platform.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:53:07.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
