The decision to raise rates came at the same Westpac announced a $3.5 billion equity raising.\n“As we have always said publicly, while Westpac is well placed to meet these changes, a significant increase in capital ultimately increases the cost of providing home loans to customers,” Mr Frazis said .\n“We acknowledge that it does impact customers, even in an environment where interest rates remain near historic lows.”\nThe bank today unveiled a three per cent increase in 2015 cash earnings to $7.8 billion. Statutory profit for the year is up six per cent from last year to $8 billion. The bank will pay final dividend of 94 cents per share, up 2.0 cents from 2014.\nOriginally published as Westpac hikes mortgage rates", "external_links": ["http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2015/10/14/financial-services/westpac-lift-home-loan-rates", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/westpac-to-raise-variable-mortgage-rates/story-fnkjidjt-1227568377155"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:18:51.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
