Golf Costa Adeje has an 18 hole course of par 72 and a 9 hole course of par 33. The sea views and the 6 lakes make the course something of a work of art in itself. Even if you’re not an avid golfer, you might want to soak up the views over the course, which stretch all the way out to La Palma and La Gomera. \nThe fun nights out \nCosta Adeje and Playa de las Americas are truly where it’s at if you’re looking for nightlife. Somewhere to sip a quiet cocktail during the day, Adeje’s Papagayo Beach Club brings back the beats on a Saturday night, blasting out techno and house music to the party people. Thirsty for more? You can hit the Monkey Beach Club on a Sunday night and hit the dance floor some more. If you want smooth grooves, you can hit Soul Suite and catch performer singing some soul and Motown classics. \nEl Medano \nEl Medano is a seaside town, popular with surfers who flock to the area to take advantage of Cabezo Beach. The coastal location, sands and plunging cliff faces make it a picturesque location. You can spend the evening in this quaint Spanish town strolling along the waterfront and sample some of the freshest sea food you’ll find in the region. The town square rests neatly by the harbor and hosts an annual fireworks display every September, so if you spot any last minute deals then this is a nice time to visit Tenerife . \nThe largest of the Canary Islands is also home to a number of family attractions, so if you’re travelling with children you should do a bit of research to get the very best out of your family holiday and even book tickets in advance to get the best deal. \nImage by William D , used under Creative Commons license", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:19:49.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
