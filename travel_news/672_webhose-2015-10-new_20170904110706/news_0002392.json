Chicago continues to offer a variety of very good dining options from the South Shore of Lake Michigan to the exciting international eats of Pilsen.\nMichelin's Bib Gourmands are selected by the company's esteemed and anonymous food inspectors and represent restaurants that serve two courses and a glass of wine or dessert for $40 or less (tax and gratuity not included). Most important, they are the restaurants that the Michelin inspectors frequent themselves.\nJoining the list are several new restaurants in Andersonville, Edgewater and Upton such as the Vietnamese family-owned Angry Crab and Sabri Nihari and Luella's Southern Kitchen. Additionally, spots like MingHin and Via Lima have caught the inspectors' attention and have quickly become favorites for their unique and authentic Chinese and Peruvian cuisine, respectively. Rounding out the list of new Bib Gourmands are: Bohemian House, Dove's Luncheonette, Duck Inn (The), mfk and Yusho.\nWhile the famous Michelin stars remain the most celebrated international distinction in the MICHELIN Guide, the Bib Gourmand is a highly desired honor among restaurateurs and one that is recognized by the many people who covet quality food at a reasonable price.\nMichelin's anonymous inspectors regularly dine across the city of Chicago , as well as in the surrounding suburbs to make their choices for the Bib Gourmands and the other restaurant selections in the MICHELIN Guide Chicago 2016 . These local inspectors are trained to scrupulously apply the same time-tested methods used by Michelin inspectors for many decades throughout the world. This ensures a uniform, international standard of excellence. As a further guarantee of complete objectivity, Michelin inspectors pay all their bills in full.\nChicago MICHELIN Guide 2016\nBib Gourmands\nRestaurant\nArea\nNew\nAngry Crab (The)\nAndersonville, Edgewater & Uptown\nN\nArami\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nA10\nChinatown & South\nAu Cheval\nWest Loop\nAvec\nWest Loop\nBalena\nLincoln Park & Old Town\nBeatrix\nRiver North\nbellyQ\nWest Loop\nBelly Shack\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nBohemian House\nRiver North\nN\nCarriage House\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nCeres' Table\nLakeview & Wrigleyville\nChilam Balam\nLakeview & Wrigleyville\nCounty\nPilsen, University Village & Bridgeport\nCumin\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nDawson (The)\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nDeCOLORES\nPilsen, University Village & Bridgeport\nDove's Luncheonette\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nN\nDuck Inn (The)\nPilsen, University Village & Bridgeport\nN\nFat Rice\nHumboldt Park & Logan Square\nFrontera Grill\nRiver North\nGilt Bar\nRiver North\nGirl & The Goat\nWest Loop\nGreen Zebra\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nGT Fish & Oyster\nRiver North\nHan 202\nPilsen, University Village & Bridgeport\nHerb\nAndersonville, Edgewater & Uptown\nHopleaf\nAndersonville, Edgewater & Uptown\nJaipur\nWest Loop\nJam\nHumboldt Park & Logan Square\nJin Thai\nAndersonville, Edgewater & Uptown\nKai Zan\nHumboldt Park & Logan Square\nLao Sze Chuan\nChinatown & South\nLuella's Southern Kitchen\nAndersonville, Edgewater & Uptown\nN\nLula Cafe\nHumboldt Park & Logan Square\nMana Food Bar\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nMaude's Liquor Bar\nWest Loop\nmfk.\nLincoln Park & Old Town\nN\nMingHin\nChinatown & South\nN\nMott St.\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nNana\nPilsen, University Village & Bridgeport\nPublican (The)\nWest Loop\nPump Room\nGold Coast\nPurple Pig (The)\nStreeterville\nRiccardo Trattoria\nLincoln Park & Old Town\nSabri Nihari\nAndersonville, Edgewater & Uptown\nN\nSlurping Turtle\nRiver North\nSmoque BBQ\nHumboldt Park & Logan Square\nSol de Mexico\nHumboldt Park & Logan Square\nSpacca Napoli\nAndersonville, Edgewater & Uptown\nSushi Dokku\nWest Loop\nTable, Donkey and Stick\nHumboldt Park & Logan Square\nTAC Quick\nLakeview & Wrigleyville\nTWO\nBucktown & Wicker Park\nUntitled Supper Club\nRiver North\nVia Lima\nLakeview & Wrigleyville\nN\nWood\nLakeview & Wrigleyville\nYusho\nHumboldt Park & Logan Square\nN\nAbout Michelin North America\nDedicated to the improvement of sustainable mobility, Michelin designs, manufactures and sells tires for every type of vehicle, including airplanes, automobiles, bicycles, Earthmovers, farm equipment, heavy-duty trucks and motorcycles.
