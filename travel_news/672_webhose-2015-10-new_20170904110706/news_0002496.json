Authorities said he had been in the bus since about 8 a.m. Sheriff's spokesman Jane Watrel told the Orlando Sentinel ( http://tinyurl.com/osseqgy ) that the bus driver and two employees at Winner's Preschool and Child Care on North Powers Drive could face neglect charges. \nThe facility declined comment. \nThe National Weather Service reported temperatures climbed to 86 degrees during that time with a heat index of 94 degrees. \nThe boy was returned to his parents in good condition. \nThe Department of Children and Families licenses day cares and has been notified. \nInformation from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/ \nThink your friends should see this?
