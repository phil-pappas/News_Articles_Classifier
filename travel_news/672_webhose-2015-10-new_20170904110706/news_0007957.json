FACEBOOK / RICHARD BAKER \nOrca captured on camera hunting and killing dolphin in the Hauraki Gulf \nRichard Baker, a past president of New Zealand Sport Fishing and current spokesman for fish stock conservation group LegaSea, said there appeared to be more dolphin activity around as snapper numbers declined and bait fish numbers rose. \nHe said he had not, however, seen orca hunting dolphins in the past. \nBaker said Jackson took the footage himself and did most of the editing. SUPPLIED \n* Dolphins spend the day in Auckland bay \nCoghlan said in the earlier incident, he and a friend were out fishing when they saw a commotion in the water and recognised orca hunting. \nHe did not approach but the dolphin, which was about 2.5m long, came towards him as it attempted to flee the pack of killer whales. FACEBOOK / RICHARD BAKER \nOrca v dolphin \nThere were several nervous moments when the pressure-wave from the orca rocked their five-metre boat from underneath, he said. \nThe pack took turns chasing the dolphin until they wore it out and then they jumped on it repeatedly. \nThe orca calmed considerably and it was evident the dolphin was dead, he said. \nKrista Hupman, a PhD student at Massey University's Coastal-Marine Research Group, also saw orca hunting common dolphin in the Gulf in the same period. \nHupman said it was \"very unusual\" behaviour and the skipper of the Auckland Whale and Dolphin Safari research boat she was aboard said he had only seen it twice in 10 years. \nThe pod appeared to be teaching a calf how to hunt and they would take turns chasing the dolphin and then \"throwing\" it to other members of the pod to chase. \nShe said it was \"brutal\" but \"to be honest, it was watching nature at its best\", she said. \nIt was \"so fascinating\" scientifically that there was no real time for sympathy for the dolphin, she said. \nHupman said there were mammal-eating orca populations in Canada but the behaviour was relatively unknown in the Hauraki Gulf. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:32:24.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
