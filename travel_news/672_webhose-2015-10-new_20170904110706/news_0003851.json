For Westminster Minicab operators this is a very positive aspect and they have started capitalizing on their location. Westminster Minicab operators have now started advertising their location in order to pick business that is related to courier services and delivery of light cargo. This means that instead of only taking human beings as travelers in their vehicles, they have now also started delivering delivery light cargo. Light cargo includes stuff such as documents, briefs, letters, parcels, toys, flowers, gifts, clothes, shoes, chocolate hampers and cosmetics. In other words any and everything under the sky as long as it is light and easy to carry and does not spoil the seats and boot of the car or leave a bad smell or odors in it.The way this process works is very simple. Westminster Minicab operators advertise their services on the internet and on websites and local search engines. When they receive a call from a customer they quickly reach the address and pick up the goods that need to be delivered. In order to ensure successful delivery Westminster Minicab operators require only a delivery address and a telephone number. They put the goods in their vehicles and deliver them to the required address in London with a few minutes or hours. Westminster minicab operators guarantee same day delivery to business addresses as long as they receive the material before 3.00pm. Delivery to residential addresses is guaranteed for the same day as long as material is picked up before 5.00pm. For express deliveries, Westminster Minicabs provide a guaranteed delivery within 2 hours. Charges are off course quite high in such cases. Westminster Minicab operators always telephone their clients and send them an SMS as soon as they have delivered the consignment. This ensures that the proof of delivery is available on the same day as the date of dispatch. A formal courier Proof of Delivery note is unfortunately not available since the Westminster Minicab operators are not registered as courier operators and have taken up this additional piece of work just to supplement their income. Westminster Minicab operators are involved in this practice since the last few years and business has been good for them. The reason for their success is really their central location that enables to travel in any corner of London within a very short period of time. It also enables them to make use of their vehicles and keep them moving. This is important because if a vehicle remains idle or stationery for a long period of time then chances are that very soon it will get damaged. Hence the practice of delivery of light cargo to different parts of London is not a bad practice at all.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nAuthor is a freelance writer and writing travel related articles Find more information about Westminster Minicab and Tower Hamlets Minicab .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:05:44.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
