The plane was flying from Gatwick to Crete it made a safe landing at Marco Polo airport in Venice with the co-pilot taking over controls.\nThis is the second time in the same week that a pilot has faced such a situation. An American Airlines pilot died at the controls. Michael Johnston, 57, from West Jordan, Utah, was flying from Phoenix to Boston on Monday morning when he became ‘incapacitated’. Mr Johnston was declared dead a few minutes after the plane landed in Syracuse, New York.\nHowever, the pilot was taken to the hospital as soon as the plane landed at the airport. The pilot is still in hospital and has regained consciousness. His condition is not life threatening. The low-cost carrier confirmed that the flight was diverted as the captain needed medical attention. The co pilot performed a routine landing. It was met with the highest priority emergency service on arrival keeping the safety of the passengers as the chief concern.\nPilots in low cost airlines are highly stressed with long and exhausting working hours. Incidents where pilots have gone through highly stressed periods that have hampered their flying experiences have become common. The Germanwings co-pilot who led his aircraft to crash in the mountainside was going through high stress. Ruthless cost cutting in budget airlines is falling back on the crew. Planes are made to take off quickly after landing. This leads to immense psychological and physical stress. Identifiable fatigue problems are reported by short-haul pilots,” including those at low-cost carriers. Fatigue can directly impair job performance. As countless studies have shown, it can also trigger a range of psychological illnesses.\nEven though the International Civil Aviation Organization, the United Nations’ aviation agency, would interrupt this race to the bottom by setting psychological safety standards for pilots most countries sets its own standards for how pilots should be evaluated psychologically once they’ve been certified and hired and those standards tend to be lax.\nThe present situation commands concern and low cost airlines will need to pay more attention to their crew health for the safety of the passengers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:10:59.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
