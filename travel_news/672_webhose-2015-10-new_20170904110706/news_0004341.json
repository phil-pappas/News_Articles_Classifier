But she wasn't the only one crying. During the year we hosted her in our home as an exchange student, Julie had become a daughter to my husband and me and a sister to our two teens.\nShe'd arrived in Arlington, Va., the previous August, eager to soak up American culture. As fully as she integrated, though, she never lost her Norwegian essence - free-spiritedness, a strong connection to nature, and powerful ties to family and tradition.\nA few years later, during a visit to Norway last summer, I was able to appreciate those values. They're reflected in one of the country's most beloved attractions: the Vigeland installation, or Vigelandsanlegget, a collection of more than 200 naked human figures formed from granite or bronze. Set within Oslo's 80-acre Frogner Park, Vigelandsanlegget is a national treasure that attracts more than a million visitors a year.\nWith its palatial lawns and brimming gardens, its fountains and ornate gates, and its outdoor swimming pool, playground and adjacent museum, Frogner is a lush home for the collection.\nNaturally, it was our first stop during our weeklong visit to Norway (on a typical summer day: overcast with sprinkles). As we entered the park, Julie - now a 21-year-old business student - smiled at the Italian, Japanese, and German tour groups and paused to watch a set of parents chase their young daughter around the granite pieces.\nNot so many years ago, she was that little girl. \"I grew up playing on these sculptures,\" she said. \"There would be tons of kids playing, and the grown-ups would sit nearby, drinking coffee from the cafe.\"\nAnd as a teenager, she and her friends would go there to hang out. \"It was great,\" she said, \"because we could get here by Metro. We'd sit in the grass and try to get some sun. Someone would bring a little barbecue and we'd grill hot dogs. We'd play volleyball and football and Kubb,\" a popular lawn game.\nAll this activity would revolve around the sculpture collection, part of a vast body of work by Gustav Vigeland, a Norwegian. It was produced, improbably, after a dispute between the artist and the city of Oslo, which wanted to demolish his house. In 1921, the artist received from the city a new building near Frogner Park, and, in return, he agreed to donate all his subsequent works to the city. Besides a studio, the space included an apartment for him and his family, including a library, bedrooms, and a lavatory (a somewhat uncommon feature in those days). Vigeland lived and worked there until his death in 1943.\nDuring those years, which included the period when Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany, the artist - often directing other stone carvers - created the spectacular array we see today: lifelike forms set in a variety of poses and situations. Some of the figures, which are human-scale or slightly larger, are alone, some are in pairs. Still others are in groups or set upon or among natural elements such as trees.\nThey're walking, running, holding hands, snuggling babies. They're dreaming, problem-solving, chuckling, roaring with rage. They're lovers knitted into an embrace, they're parents comforting children, they're old men torqued by the brittleness of age. Realistically and in the abstract, they depict the breadth of human experience.\nI'd be lying if I didn't acknowledge that the (nearly) anatomical correctness of the naked figures is initially startling. But the nudity is intended to evoke a human essence beyond time and space, says Vigeland Museum director Jarle Stromodden. \"The general public - and these are visitors from all over the world - understands and accepts their nudity within that context,\" he says. Indeed, we found the raw beauty of the human form elicits feelings of peaceful wonder - a mixture of \"wow!\" and \"ahhhh!\" - underscored by the knowledge that we'll never see a display like this back home.\nVigeland's body of work includes woodcuts, drawings, iron works, and crafts such as weavings, some of which can be seen in the museum. He created several public monuments across Scandinavia and designed the medal for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nYet he didn't attract much worldwide attention. \"While he wasn't regarded as an important sculptor in the art world,\" Stromodden says, \"his achievements in the park are recognized and appreciated.\"\nAnd not just in Scandinavia. \"He speaks to visitors in different ways,\" says Stromodden, recounting a recent conversation with the wife of the Thai ambassador to Norway. \"People from Japan, China, and Thailand, for example, they find elements in the park that others don't see as much. It relates to the cyclic elements of the park and sculptures and has something to do with their belief in reincarnation. We tend to think of life as birth and death, while others don't believe it ends there.\"\nOne of the best-known pieces is the bronze statue called Angry Boy ( Sinnataggen in Norwegian), which depicts a toddler in full meltdown: fists clenched, foot stomping, face contorted in frustration. It's a stance recognized, and dreaded, by parents everywhere. The statue's left hand is burnished, worn down by the rumor that to touch it is to invite good luck.\nThe Fountain, one of the earliest pieces installed in the park, features a huge bronze basin held high in the air by six giants of various ages. Water gushes like a screen over the top of the basin, pooling near their feet before continuing down.\nThe Monolith (or Monolitten ), set in the park in 1943, is the collection's focal point. Standing more than 45 feet high and carved from a single piece of granite, it features 121 human figures - men, women, children and babies - pivoting around an imaginary axis in a tangle of torsos and limbs.\nInterpretations of it vary: It represents man's resurrection, maybe, or the struggle for existence. Some say it shows human desire to reach out to the divine, or the transcendence of everyday life and cyclic repetition. However, when Vigeland was asked to explain the meaning of the work, he was cryptic: \"He replied, 'This is my religion,' \" says Stromodden. \"To me, this is both an interesting and an irritating response.\"\nAnd Vigeland put only simple descriptions, not titles, on his sculptures. \"In doing so,\" Stromodden says, \"Vigeland intended to make them open to the spectators' interpretations. I think that's a generous gesture.\"\nThose interpretations may be drawn from the position of a body, the flow of the hair, the downturn of a lip. Posture and facial expressions speak to an array of universal emotions from birth to old age. \"The best thing about these sculptures is that you can recognize some of your own feelings here, no matter how old you are,\" Julie says.\nHer grandmother Milda Augusta Leirskar remembers her first look at the collection. It was 1956, and she was a 21-year-old culinary student in Oslo, down in the big city from a farm in her hometown of Krokstrand, 650 miles to the north. With Julie's mother translating for me from the Norwegian, Milda, 80, says what she most remembers from that first visit was her awe at how Vigeland \"expresses love, anxiousness, anger, and trust - all from stone.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:24:21.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
