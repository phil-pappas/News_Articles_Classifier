Wales may have gone out, but in my view Sam Warburton , the captain, returns home as a national hero. It's not just about the way he played. He's a warrior, we know that. But it's also the way he handled himself after the match against South Africa. He spoke well. He made no excuses. That's so difficult to do when emotions are running high. Sam has just been a credit to us . He's come out of the tournament with so much credit. It's been fantastic for him and his family. Greig Laidlaw was also exceptional as a leader, by the way, for Scotland. I don't know Greg that well but he comes across as a very similar character to Sam. You don't see his arms go flapping. He seems a very cool-headed character . It's a different position. The No 9 is your general. There's a hell of a lot of pressure on you when you're scrum half and the captain. And the kicker. When you sit back and think about it, that's an incredible amount of pressure to carry on your shoulders. Sam's come out of the tournament with so much credit. It's been fantastic for him and his family Against Samoa he was outstanding in that crunch game to get through and he was again outstanding yesterday. He controlled the game and kept his cool. It never looked like the game was going to get away from him. It would only take a couple of words just to settle the guys down. A lot of time players will look to their captain and if he's all flustered and losing his rag, it can rub off on them. It filters through. But he kept his calm and composure even though the result was gut-wrenching for Scotland. It was one of those calls where you think, \"Oh that was accidental offside.\" There's no way you could have been 100 per cent sure that had come off a Scotland player. The commonsense call was to give an accidental offside. You can't go to the TMO for that situation. But there was so much doubt in it. Scotland have never been in that situation before. They've got to learn from that now. In some ways you can say they've done what Wales did four years ago. Nobody expected it. They came bottom in the Six Nations. What they were looking towards was Japan [in 2019] and this was the stepping stone. They didn't get to the semi-final, but they've done really well. It augurs well for their future, and they have a real talisman there in Laidlaw, who can help develop a very strong group, who are now like a rugby family. Back to Warburton. The way he's spoken after games in interviews and post-match conferences has been immaculate. Nobody within the camp has made any excuses about the injuries. There's an immense amount of pride about the way they've gone about their business and handled all that adversity. Captain fantastic: Greig Laidlaw in action for Scotland against Australia Photo: Getty But I do think I need to say one thing: there's a feeling that it's the same old story for Wales. We're gallant losers. Close but not close enough. There's a sense of that on social media and what not. But when you look at the key players Wales were missing, it was incredible to see them do what they did. Playing devil's advocate here, when we've had those missing players we still haven't been able to beat those teams from the southern hemisphere. Who knows what would have happened if we'd had Scott Williams against Australia or Jonathan Davies. He might have created something and we could have ended up playing Scotland. Unfortunately that didn't happen. It's all ifs, buts and maybes. As a fan of any sports team all you hope is that they don't leave anything out there on the field and they give it absolutely everything. And that's what this team definitely did. I think they will have been sharing dinner and a few beers Saturday night. That's the end of the tournament for them, but they wouldn't have been ready to leave. They would have been looking forward to the next couple of weeks and then all of a sudden it's gone. You're on this journey and this rollercoaster of emotion, this bubble of the World Cup, with a big group of people who have become a family together, and then it's all over. On Saturday they would have had a few beers together, travelled back from London yesterday and then it's back to your day job really with your regional teams and your clubs. It will be a real sense of anticlimax for a few days. It will take some time to get back into club mode. The management team will do a lot of the analysis now without the players from the last game in this downtime so they're prepared for the Six Nations. Wales can look themselves in the mirror and think they couldn't have given any more The way it is with professional contracts, guys will go back to their clubs and then won't focus on Wales until the end of January and the Six Nations. That's the strange thing about it all. One minute you're living and breathing everything to do with the World Cup and then it's over before you know it. For those who have kids, you go back to them and realise it's just a game at the end of the day. There's no better way to realise that losing a rugby game isn't the end of the world. There's more important things to worry about. For those who don't have kids, there's the parents and the girlfriends or just friends. They'll try to bring you back to normality. It's a harsh thing to say, but being a professional athlete does feel like the end of the world when you suffer a bad loss. It is great to get back to normality and be with people you love and trust. You'll also have the other group who didn't get to play much rugby and they can't wait to get back on the training ground and playing for their clubs. There will be a real diverse feeling amongst the 30 players. Wales can look themselves in the mirror and think they couldn't have given any more. That's the way to lose, if you have to lose. There will be a sense of frustration, no doubt. Sometimes if you lose by a wide margin to a much better side, that's a lot easier to take. But when it's close and the teams are separated only by fine margins, that makes it much harder to get over. The real hammerings were easier to get over. That's what I found in my career. Sport is funny that way. It's always ifs and buts... unless you win every game. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:41:22.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
