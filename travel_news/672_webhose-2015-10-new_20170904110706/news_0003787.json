Screened-in porches, sounds of crickets, kitchenettes, the quietude of sundown, and the low voices of others in nearby accommodations. This is preserved at the Chautauqua National Historic Landmark.\nIt may not be for everyone. There’s no infinity pool or, for that matter, a swimming pool. No TV or phone in the 60 vacation residences. No maid service unless you request it. New linens are available by exchange. Instead of a disposal, there is a bucket labeled “compost” for any food scraps.\nStill, if you are amenable and you support green initiatives, you can experience a unique Colorado destination with a Texas legacy. It’s one of a handful of continuously operating venues of the chautauqua cultural and intellectual movement, which began in 1874 in southwestern New York. Named after an adjacent lake, New York’s Chautauqua Institute still operates and may have 100,000 visitors during its summer-only sessions.\nThe Colorado Chautauqua opened in 1898 as a partnership of the city of Boulder and the University of Texas Board of Regents, which wanted to leverage the increasingly popular chautauqua concept with a cooler summer location for a retreat for university teachers.\nYou could say Colorado Chautauqua is still on the case, though there’s no formal UT System involvement. It is year-round, unlike New York, and its schedule of enlightenment and entertainment includes classical dance, lectures on outer space, popular novelists, a counterintuitive consultant on business sustainability, performances by musicians like Emmylou Harris, and interactive outdoor theater with a Boulder troupe that features appearances by “zombies” bent on your destruction.\nRates are not exorbitant — $200-plus daily in the summer season for a studio with queen-size beds. Budget choices like Holiday Inn Express or Best Western might offer more amenities. The absence of modern conveniences can be attributed in part to Colorado Chautauqua’s emphasis on green operations — the goal is to become the nation’s “most environmentally sustainable” national historical monument. That includes long-term zero waste management and water and energy conservation.\nCount on exercise, especially if you are up the hill from the dining hall, auditorium and community center. Hiking and biking trails originate at Chautauqua’s boundaries and, depending on snow cover, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing and sledding are pursuits in winter.\nDining is special. On temperate days, the place to be is the porch of the 117-year-old dining hall, with views of the Chautauqua Green or the Flatiron Mountains. When it’s cold, enjoy your meals in front of a massive stone fireplace. If you are an overnight guest, you don’t have to deal with lack of parking, a consequence of the horse-and-buggy era when Chautauqua was designed. Three Leaf Concepts, a farm-to-table enterprise that has a farm and seven other area restaurants and teahouses, assumed management of Chautauqua dining in 2013 with striking success, according to residents.\nFor dinner, we order squash curry soup, mini-salmon cakes on quinoa salad and sesame-encrusted swordfish with vegetable hash and watch local residents arrive on bicycles for their evening meal. Our bill for two is $50. We stroll about 100 yards to the auditorium for a rendezvous with country music and blues outlaw Steve Earle and his band, the Dukes. It’s another 200 yards to our cottage on Primrose Lane.\nWe recall a comment at the performance from a Boulder resident in a nearby seat: “I’m so glad there’s none of that [expletive] weed around us.” That would be true because Chautauqua Colorado’s 40 acres are smoke-free.\nOn our porch, we speak sotto voce because of a quiet time imposed from 11 p.m. until 8 a.m. and from 1 until 3 p.m., in deference to a century-old chautauqua concept. As the Colorado Chautauqua says, “This cherished custom allows our visitors and guests to enjoy the contemplative nature of our beautiful surroundings.”\nWe crank up the water cooler and ceiling fan because of late summer temperatures; there’s no central air conditioning. If we are here in colder weather, there’s a wall heater and quilts.\nJohn Lumpkin is a freelance writer in Richardson.
