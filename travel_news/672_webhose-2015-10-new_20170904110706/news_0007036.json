On offer is the bounty of the north, from reindeer in cream sauce to fresh Greenland halibut, and tables of desserts from cheesecake to cloudberries and cream.\nI’m set to dig in when the public-address system interrupts the meal. The captain, we’re told, has spotted the northern lights. After five cloudy nights on our winter voyage, the celebrated aurora borealis that lured passengers to Norway in the dead of winter has finally made an appearance.\nWhat to do? Feast on a gourmet spread or partake in a celestial wonder?\nI take a bite of smoked sea trout, and make my choice. Dinner can wait. I head to the windswept deck.\nFor decades, the ship line Hurtigruten has drawn passengers to the Norway coast to savor the country’s magnificent mountains and fjords. The route weaves past islands, inlets and shoals for a trip that the company, in uncharacteristic Scandinavian braggadocio, calls the most beautiful voyage in the world.\nTrips sell out during the summer, but it takes a different type of passenger to head to the Arctic. In recent years, the line has begun to promote aurora cruises. Increasingly, British tourists have been making the trip inspired by Joanna Lumley, the former star of the BBC comedy Absolutely Fabulous , who made a documentary about chasing the lights across Norway.\n‘We’re a working vessel’\nAnd there’s no easier way to see them than by sea. The cruise line, whose name means swift boat in Norwegian, has been sailing these waters for 122 years, originally delivering mail and supplies to tiny fishing villages and outposts. The lines’ 11 ships operate every day of the year, stopping at 34 ports as they sail in an endless loop up and down the coast.\nWhile the ships have cruise cabins and handsome dining rooms with wait service and wine pairings, they also carry short-haul passengers. So as you wander through plush lounges, you’re liable to encounter day-trippers fast asleep with stocking feet on tables. For them, this is little more than a bus ride between towns.\n“We never say we’re a cruise ship. We’re a working vessel,” says Petrer Overaa, a manager on the 285-cabin Finnmarken, one of the line’s biggest ships. “We don’t have pink drinks or a casino.”\nIndeed, instead of theater shows with Broadway dance numbers and laser special effects, entertainment is limited to an occasional DVD about the northern lights, or the Sami people, the native group that have lived in the northlands for millennia. Or one can settle down in the library for a game of Scrabble, a bit of a challenge because the Norwegian version seems to have an abundance of Ks and Fs. Many passengers read, bird-watch or follow landmarks with an elaborate guidebook giving GPS coordinates for every site from fishing village to historic bridge.\nAction-packed adventures\nSince the lights only appear at night, passengers need something to do during the day. The ship offers shore excursions, selling snowmobiling adventures or walking tours of picturesque cities like Alesund, a fairy-tale town with canals and art nouveau architecture set against snow-capped mountains.\nSome outings are action-packed, such as the dog-sledding trip I take one afternoon near the city of Tromso, which calls itself the capital of the Arctic. Once ashore, I board a bus to a farm, where I’m directed to a changing room to don a snowsuit, boots and thick leather gloves.\nIt initially seems like overkill when I’m directed to a large enclosure, where 7-week-old Alaskan husky puppies are at play. Our guide urges us to pick them up and cuddle, and it’s hard to tell who’s enjoying it more, the canines or the humans. But a few minutes later, the need for the outfits becomes clear when I’m placed into a sled with a Brit named Brian. We’re covered with blankets as a sled driver steps on the rails behind us. Our team of huskies, just a year older than pups, howl and pull at their harnesses. With a yelp, we take off along a track and are soon peacefully sliding through the snow. The only sound is Brian and the sled driver, Whitey from New Zealand, chatting about the past year’s cricket season.\nAnother evening, I leave the ship at the tiny port of Kjøllefjord and head to a windswept tundra where I’m directed to a line of snowmobiles. After a two-minute briefing and driving lesson, I climb aboard and zoom off with a single file of vehicles into the darkness, our path lighted only by the machines’ headlights.\nThere’s a reason for the speed: The goal is to reach the next port in time to meet our ship, which has sailed ahead. As we fly through the night, I keep glancing up, hoping to catch a glimpse of the northern lights. But it’s cloudy, and frankly, I need to be looking at the track ahead. I make it back to the ship in one piece, but with no sign of the famed aurora.\nOne afternoon, I join a hike out of the city of Bodo, and guide Henry Johnson provides hiking poles and spikes that snap on to our boots. We walk a few miles on a path on the edge of town, passing a Viking site and a World War II German POW camp.\nNorwegians head outdoors year-round, Johnson says. “This is what we do,” he says. “We’re a young nation. Our national heroes are explorers.”\nNot the show we expected\nThe country also reveres Hurtigruten. In 2011, the country’s television network ran a nonstop 134-hour live feed of a ship making the customary voyage from Bergen to the far north town of Kirkenes on the Russian border. It was a ratings sensation, with some viewers watching the ship in the middle of the night and crowds gathering in each port to greet its arrival.\nAfter several days aboard, I’m beginning to understand the national obsession for the line and the country’s beauty. And now stepping on the deck joining dozens of other northern lights seekers, I brace myself against the wind blowing off the Barents Sea as we all search the sky for the aurora.\nTonight’s show, I have to admit, is a bit of bust. The lights are wispy, little more than clouds in the night sky. If I were a bucket-list keeper, it would count, but I had been hoping for more.\nI return to dinner, where the buffet is wrapping up. I finish my carrot ginger cake with shot of aquavit, and retreat to my room to pack my bags.\nOne last chance\nThe next day offers one last chance to see the lights, though. I’ve signed up for a post-cruise adventure, including a bus trip to the Russian border, a king crab harvest from a frozen fjord, and finally, a night spent in a hotel made of snow.\nThe Kirkenes Snow Hotel, which operates December through March, is built anew every year and decorated with ice sculptures. There’s a bar made of ice, serving vodka in shot glasses of ice. Beds are air mattresses placed in separate ice chambers. Guests are issued heavy-duty sleeping bags good to 30 below zero, so it’s actually quite toasty — when you finally get under the covers.\nI’m readying for bed when a cry goes up across the hotel. The northern lights have appeared. I pull on a jacket, a few hats and mittens and rush outside.\nSure enough, the horizon glows like it’s illuminated by hidden klieg lights. Then a curtain seems to break off and begins to slide across the sky. Its white glow slowly turns green and I gasp. The show continues for another 45 minutes until clouds begin to fill the sky.\nAs I make my way back to my ice chamber, I think back to the German engineer who sat next to me on the airport bus to Bergen when our journey started more than a week ago.\nAnyone, he told me, could tour the Arctic during the summer. It takes a different breed to visit during winter. “Norway in February,” he sighs. “This is the time to come.”\nAnd now, as I slip into my sleeping bag in a room made of snow and visions of the aurora dancing in my head, I have to agree he’s right.\nLarry Bleiberg is the former travel editor at The Dallas Morning News and lives in Birmingham, Ala.
