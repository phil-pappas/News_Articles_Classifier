They vary from host to host. Here are some tips to improve your chances of a safe and satisfying experience with Airbnb:\n• Read everything carefully before you book. You can’t march down to the front desk to make a complaint or switch rooms. You’re pretty much on your own.\nEach profile lists amenities and safety features. Smoke or carbon monoxide detectors are required in U.S. hotels, but only encouraged by Airbnb. This year the company has offered 25,000 free detectors to Airbnb hosts. If you don’t see them addressed, ask. Also ask about stairs or other features that are important to you (like air-conditioning). Our Paris apartment was on the third floor, accessed by a steep spiral staircase, and had no elevator.\n• Study the location. The profile shows a section of the neighborhood, but you don’t learn the exact address until you book. Use street view, satellite view and other Internet tools to get a better idea of where you are and what’s close by.\n• Keep in mind that laws vary regarding short-term guests in private homes or apartments. Legal issues have plagued Airbnb in New York City and San Francisco in particular. The New York state attorney general’s office estimates that more than 70 percent of all private short-term rentals on Airbnb violate laws banning unhosted stays of fewer than 30 days. Will you be thrown out into the street if housing officials suddenly crack down on a host?\n• Read the cancellation policy thoroughly. They vary from host to host. They may be flexible (full refund one day prior to arrival, except fees); moderate (full refund five days prior to arrival, except fees) or strict (50 percent refund until one week prior to arrival, except fees). Typically, cancellation policies are stricter in more competitive cities like New York or Chicago. The cleaning fee is always refunded if you don’t check in, but the booking fees are not.\n• Deposits and fees vary. Most hosts charge a fee if you lose keys. Our Berlin apartment was the only accommodation we encountered that required a 100 euro deposit upon our arrival. Guests pay a booking fee of 6-12 percent (which goes to Airbnb), as well as a one-time cleaning fee set by the host. Hosts also pay Airbnb a 3 percent service fee for each confirmed reservation.\n• Check the refund policy. The Airbnb website says refunds will be made if (1) the host cancels a reservation 24 hours or less before the scheduled start of the stay or fails to provide the guest with access to the accommodation, (2) the listing description is materially different from the actual accommodation (such as its size, amenities or location), or (3) the accommodation is not generally clean or as described. The key: Guests must notify Airbnb within 24 hours of a “travel issue” to be considered for a refund. Airbnb also has a Resolution Center where hosts or guests can try to work out issues.\n• The website encourages all guests: “In case of an emergency or you feel your personal safety is threatened, contact the local police or emergency services immediately.”\nGeorge Hobica, founder of the website Airfarewatchdog.com, urges Airbnb guests to get local emergency numbers for police, fire and ambulance services before their visit and to know how to reach them on a mobile phone.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.post-gazette.com/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:06:55.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
