In the first program, Southwest Detroiters who feed their families using the federal Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) can soon buy healthy food for less money through a traveling food pantry that Gleaners will launch before the end of the year. The second program involves an innovative logistics plan that will help Forgotten Harvest source more food and distribute that food more efficiently and less expensively to underserved areas of Metro Detroit. The PepsiCo employees are members of PepsiCorps, a skills-based volunteer program in which select PepsiCo associates from around the world are deployed to a community to leverage their business skills and expertise to address societal challenges. This spring, eight PepsiCorps volunteer professionals - working in two teams of four - helped Gleaners and Forgotten Harvest develop separate projects designed to affordably and efficiently distribute food to those in need. Today, the teams reunited in Detroit to turn their plans into action. To help make the PepsiCorps recommendations a reality, the PepsiCo Foundation donated a 53 foot semi-tractor trailer to Forgotten Harvest and a 24 foot mobile food pantry to Gleaners. \"As the world watches the rebirth of Detroit , we deployed PepsiCorps to the Motor City to play a critical role in helping build a stronger city by providing residents with more reliable and efficient ways to obtain healthy and nutritious food,\" said Tony West , executive vice president, general counsel of PepsiCo and president of the PepsiCo Foundation . \"We work every day to improve the lives of people in the communities where we work, live and serve. We are honored to be working with Gleaners and Forgotten Harvest to make a positive impact on society, and as we watch the renaissance of this great city continue, we will do it knowing that we played a very small, but important role.\" Special Deliveries A PepsiCorps team worked together with Gleaners to develop \"My Neighborhood Mobile Grocery,\" a traveling pantry that will enable SNAP clients in southwest Detroit to maximize their purchasing power and select nutritious items based on dietary needs and food preferences. About a third of Southwest Detroit residents receive SNAP benefits, also known as the Bridge Card or EBT. About 45 percent of SNAP recipients are under 17. Each month a typical SNAP client receives $130 in food benefits, and the majority of clients exhaust their benefits halfway through the month. My Neighborhood Mobile Grocery customers will be able to purchase nutritious food at subsidized prices from a list of about 50 staples, such as milk, potatoes and cooking oil. The goal is that each family using SNAP would stretch its monthly budget by receiving $70 worth of food for every $50 spent. \"The PepsiCorps volunteers brought the full power of their global expertise to help us with a strategy to deliver fresh fruits, vegetables, dairy and grains to SNAP clients, many of whom are families with young children,\" said Gleaners President Gerry Brisson . Hub & Spoke: Rescuing more healthy food, less expensively, in less time A second PepsiCorps team and Forgotten Harvest, one of America's largest food rescue operations, looked at a new model to further improve logistical efficiencies, such as fleet routing and warehouse management. Using a hub and spoke model, Forgotten Harvest will be utilizing a more decentralized supply chain model that should ensure the availability of a higher volume of fresh, healthy food, delivered less expensively to critical areas of need in Metro Detroit. The plan should enable Forgotten Harvest to save money and time by coordinating logistics and food collection, and food delivery pick-ups and drop-offs. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:12:07.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
