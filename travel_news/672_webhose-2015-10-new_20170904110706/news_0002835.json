Caught on camera: The amazing moment a woman gives birth to... The most outrageous hotel concierge requests revealed:... 'I got butterflies when standing among the ruins - it just felt right.\n'You don't mess with your gut feeling when it's that strong.'\nThe wanderlust-loving couple are already planning to return to Iceland on the fifth anniversary of their unique nuptials\nAs they hunted locations, the pair lived out of a van to cut costs and traversed the island in search of the 'perfect' location. Pictured: Jokulsarlon glacial lagoon\nOne of the couple's breath-taking snaps was of them standing under a rainbow in a field in the middle of the country\nHere, Jeremy and Rachelle Garrett wander along the rugged Black Sand Beach, which is located in Vik, Iceland\nIn southern Iceland, endless moss fields stretch out in front of the happy couple though this wasn't where they settled on ultimately\nIn Seljavallalaugh, high-school sweethearts Jeremy and Rachelle visited some of the country's famed hot springs\nEven simply getting off on the side of the road can result in incredible images, such as this one - complete with a horse\nThe couple also stopped by to see Seljalandsfoss, which is one of the best known waterfalls in Iceland\n'The way it worked out was all a total fluke,' she explained.\n'We had a general idea of where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see, and the rest we just planned along the way. Everything just fell into place.'\nJeremy, 32, added: 'We're pretty simple and easy-going people - an expensive 'fairytale' wedding is the farthest thing from what we ever wanted.\n'To spend a ridiculous amount of money and stress worrying about something that lasts one day seemed so trivial. We were focused on our marriage, not our wedding.'\nTogether, they held hands while trekking over glaciers, like this one in the Jokulsarlon Lagoon at Iceberg Beach\nStanding in between two gigantic boulders, Rachelle and Jeremy took in some undeniably stunning sunny views\nHome to one of the smaller ice caps in Iceland, Eyjafjallaj√∂kull consists of a large volcano, which is completely covered\nThe couple eventually decided on getting married amid the ancient ruins of a church, but Gljufrabui waterfall would've been a good backup option\nRachelle, wearing her wedding dress, poses with Jeremy in Dyrholaey, which is a small peninsula near the village of Vik\nJeremy (left) and Rachelle (right) ultimately settled upon the ancient ruins of an old church as the site for their ceremony\nWalking off into the sunset...: Jeremy and Rachelle hold hands as the sun sets on Black Sand Beach\nThe couple had just one guest - their photographer Tory Moth. Yet, despite their cost saving measures, they still managed to have such a storybook ceremony.\n'It may not be for everyone, but it was exactly what we wanted,' Jeremy said.\n'Iceland was a place we always wanted to visit, it was on our mutual 'bucket list' - so it seemed like the obvious answer. It was also far enough away that we didn't offend anyone by going alone!\n'We are already planning to return to Iceland on our fifth anniversary - it can't come soon enough.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1ReFHra"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:12:15.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
