Â© Betsy Malloy 2004 What Is Hollywood and Highland? \nFirst, it's the location of two intersecting streets: Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. At that location you'll find an energetic, three-story, shopping/dining entertainment complex, a twenty-first century landmark that constantly tips its hat to the past. \nFrom references to D. W. Griffith's 1916 film Intolerance in the multi-story \"gate\" at the end of the courtyard and the elephant statues surrounding it, to the stories captured in the \"Road to Hollywood,\" this place constantly celebrates the film industry's past. And for that alone, it's fun to visit. You could spend almost an hour just reading all the stories and trying to guess whose they are. \nThe complex is occupied by shops and restaurants. Besides those, Hollywood and Highland also connects to the Dolby Theatre (home of the Academy Awards and Cirque du Soleil's IRIS) and Grauman's Chinese Theater . Tours of both theaters are available for a fee. \nThe arch structure frames a terrific view of the Hollywood Sign . If you go to the back, past the arch, you and your pals can pose for pictures on the larger-than-life \"casting couch\" with the Hollywood Sign in the background. \nHollywood and Highland is a good base to start a walking tour of Hollywood Boulevard and the best place to park while doing it. See it with Grauman's Chinese Theater , the Dolby Theatre and the Hollywood Walk of Fame . \nHere's a tip to save money: parking is cheaper with validation. Even if you didn't buy anything, you'll save money if you get a coffee or bottle of water at Starbuck's. Some shops will validate if you ask nicely, even if you didn't buy anything there, but do be polite about it. And another tip from a friendly security guard who has to find his car every day in that big parking lot: park along the only wall that has parking spaces and it will be easy to locate your vehicle when you're ready to leave. \nYou'll often find street performers on the sidewalk in front of Hollywood and Highland, dressed up as everything from Batman to Shrek. If you take a picture with them, keep in mind that they earn their living doing this and give them a tip.
