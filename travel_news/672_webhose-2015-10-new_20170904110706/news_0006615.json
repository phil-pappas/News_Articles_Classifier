(AP) â€” Authorities say work will soon begin on a walking and biking path between downtown Hattiesburg and the University of Southern Mississippi . It's part of the Longleaf Trace rails-to-trails project.\nThe Hattiesburg American ( http://hatne.ws/1KyuIUn ) reports that city engineer Lamar Rutland told the City Council last week he expects to meet this week with the contractor. He says crews are expected on site in the next few weeks.\nThe spur will cover about two miles along a former railroad line.\nRutland says another tail spur will have to be rebid because all bids were too high. It would run from the Hattiesburg train depot to Chain Park.\nThe completed Trace would run about 43 miles from downtown Hattiesburg through USM, Sumrall and Bassfield to Prentiss.\n___\nInformation from: The Hattiesburg American, http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://hatne.ws/1KyuIUn", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:48:27.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
