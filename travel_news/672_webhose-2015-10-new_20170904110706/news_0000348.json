I have to admit, I’m sort of adventurous, only not very. \nRecently, I was given an opportunity to test my stomach for adventure and so I set off on an overland road trip. Not just any road trip, this was an epic journey all the way from Kuala Lumpur to London across Asia and Europe. Yes, 23,000km all in! \nAlthough I was only going part of the way — just the Chinese sector, from Kunming to Rombok (Mt. Everest Base Camp 1) — that itself was epic enough for me. My journey was to take me 2,600km according to the plan, but as the title of this story goes, we clocked in an additional 1,300km for a total of 3,900km. What an adventure it turned out to be! The trip of a lifetime… was I ready for it? \nFrom the start of the briefing that took place two months before the trip, the expedition team — comprising leader Thomas “Tango” Foo, coordinator Steven “Sierra” Ng and sweeper Mohd “One Dollar” Assir — kept reminding us to try to acclimatise our bodies to several conditions such as, no spicy food (to clear the stomach), eating less (food on the trip would not be as easily available), maintain our fitness level (the air will be very thin where we’re headed) and of course have sufficient warm clothing. \nThey were wise advice from seasoned travellers who have trotted all around the globe, but at that time, I had great confidence in my ability to pull off this great trans Scandinavian escapade with ease. Expedition team leaders (from left) Steven ‘Sierra’ Ng, Mohd. ‘One Dollar’ Assir, Ng Keem Chuan, Thomas ‘Tango’ Foo. \nWhile they spoke, I was thinking: “How to eat less lah? Eating is a passion…a religion even!”, “No spicy food…no problem”, “Fitness level? How physically taxing could it get? Most of the people on the trip are older than me”; and “Cold? Ok… that shouldn’t be a problem”. \nWhat they didn’t warn me was the mental strength that was needed for the trip. I wasn’t ready for that, as I found out later. \nExcuse me, is this still Earth? \nA four-hour flight took me to Kunming in China, followed by another four hours on the road to meet up with the convoy at a lakeside resort in Fuxianhu, Yunnan province. It seemed to me we had gone interstellar. Good God! The distances we covered in a day was just crazy. \nMind you, the road leg of the journey was all highway, and it still took four hours. And, this was just the start of it. Can you imagine the next few weeks? In hindsight, that four-hour van ride to Fuxianhu seemed like a drive down to town compared to what we had to cover the next few weeks. The tiny highway wends its way around the mountains, following the curves carved out by the river over time. \nBut you know what? It was so, so worth it when you think of how many people (whom you know) who have actually seen what you’ve seen, or about to see. Words can’t even begin to relate to the beauty of this land. \nWhen I first told people about this journey, they all looked at me funny. WHY? Why drive all the way there when one could easily fly into any of these places, ogle at the beauty and gorge on the local food and then fly back. It made perfect sense but what they didn’t realise was that we were going into areas that would have taken days to get into if they had flown, driven there and driven back to the airport. \nAnd they would have only seen ONE place. Through this journey, I have been to towns that are not even on the map, names of places that you’d never ever heard of or even known how to pronounce: Fuxianhu, Zogang, Deqin, Rawu, Damxung and Tingri, just to name a few. They exist! Go ahead and google it. \nIt’s the journey, not the destination \nChina as many people know, is still run by the communist government. They run a VERY, VERY tight ship there. Anyone caught flouting their rules end up on the wrong side of the law. \nThe permit (to drive through China) for our convoy was only via Highway G318. However, somewhere along the way, one of the bridges after Bomi headed towards Lhasa was washed away during a freak storm, leaving us stranded and clueless in the middle of nowhere between Bomi and Bangda, in a little place called Puka. \nThen, we were told that there was an alternative route further north on Highway S303, but it would mean that we’d have to backtrack at least 500km to a little crossroad town called Bangda, head up north to get onto S303. \nWe were told that Highway S303 has never been opened to any foreigners. What an achievement it would be for us, the first Malaysians to be on Highway S303! To cap it all off, we witnessed the most amazing scenery created by God…and man. The mountains through the camera lens look just like a painting. Now these are what you would call hairpin bends. \nStill very high-spirited, we spent a night in Puka and planned to push off bright and early the next day. The scenery out of Bangda was magnificent! The Tibetan plateau has got to be one of the most peaceful and serene places in the world. Unfortunately, pictures do not do justice to the magnificent beauty that is the Tibetan plateau, but see for yourselves. \nAlong the way, we also got a chance to stop by a nomadic village. We were greeted with such genuine warmth. They invited us to their homes for tea, but unfortunately, we could not take them up on their invitation as we were already behind schedule. We did however get a chance to take some pretty pictures with them. \nBut, that was like the calm before the storm. I did mention earlier China was run like a tight ship. Well, we found out how tight it was then. \nThere were many police and army checkpoints all along the road to Lhasa. We were not allowed to bring out our cameras as we approached these checkpoints, so I do not have any pictures to show for them. \nAt the first checkpoint on Highway S303, we were informed that we were not allowed to be there as our permit was only valid for G318. We pleaded with them and explained our predicament with the collapsed bridge and all. They didn’t flinch! Anywhere beyond that checkpoint, they would have caught us and thrown us all in jail for trespassing. \nImagine that! Driving all the way there, covering some 400 odd kms only to be told we had to turn back! \nThe real adventure begins \nWe were told there was no alternative route for us to take. Some quick calls were made to relevant authorities and we were informed the army had built a temporary bridge to replace the one that was washed away. \nGood news indeed! What they didn’t tell us was the bridge was only meant for pedestrians. Goodness, what were we going to do with our cars? Tango said, “We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it”. \nWith more than 800km (which loosely translates to one to two days of driving, he had hoped that the Chinese army would have built something sturdier, something where cars could also to go onto. I did not envy Thomas then. \nAnyhow, we eventually arrived at Bomi the next day. Small little town, no bigger than Kampar, Perak, but with the friendliest folks I’ve ever met. Must be the fact that it was a small town and they people had not seen too many foreigners around there. Even the pigs came out to greet us. \nThe next day, we got more bad news from our local guide. Someone was washed away from the bridge that we were about to cross the night before and due to that, the local authorities had stopped all crossings until a better bridge was constructed. \nWhat the hell? What were we to do? The convoy HAD to get across China to reach London but without that bridge, the authorities were not about to issue another permit for the convoy. As if we haven’t had enough of adventure already! \nPlanes, trucks and automobiles, the drama doesn’t end \nWe couldn’t drive on any other route, the bridge had collapsed (yet again), so how on earth were we going to get around this problem? \n“Truck the cars on S303! And we’ll fly to Lhasa!” cried Thomas. We may not be able to drive our cars on S303, but our cars can be transported on trucks that are driven on the S303. Go figure that one out! \nMeanwhile, for us to fly to Lhasa, we had to hire vans to transport all 30 of us to Shangri La. A 24-hour journey covering almost 1,000km if we were to get to the airport on time. Off we went, like a bunch of school kids going on a field trip, we were packed off into vans. \nEverything seemed ok up until 2100hrs. We had already been on the road for a good 11 hours. The van drivers seemed invincible. Nothing that a constant flow of Red Bull couldn’t handle, they said. And then the night fog set in and visibility was only down to about 10 feet. \nRavines that drop several hundred feet on one side and hill slopes on the other. And to top it all off, we had drugged up van drivers that were pumped up with caffeine driving dangerously fast. \nSo, for the safety of all 30 passengers, we (the Malaysian drivers) staged a mutiny and took over the driving. Of course we did it very diplomatically telling the drivers they had to rest since they were driving for so long already. And as if that wasn’t “drama” enough, news came from the front that another road up ahead had been closed due to a landslide. \nFortunately, there was an alternative road albeit an old and winding one. So, after an adrenaline-pumping 20-hour drive, we finally made it to Shangri La at 0700hrs. Slept for 30 minutes, got up and went to the airport. Lhasa here we come. \nWe spent the next two days in Lhasa waiting for our cars to arrive. While waiting, we had a chance to explore this yak butter-scented city. The two days in Lhasa gave us an insight into how the Tibetans are as an oppressed nation. We thought we had it bad in Malaysia, it is nowhere as bad as the Tibetans have it. They’re even not allowed to leave Tibet! \nThe Jokhang Monastery, the capital of Buddhism, is so heavily fortified by the Chinese that at every entry point into the square, everyone had to go through an X-ray machine (we were again told that all cameras pointed at any of the police outpost would be confiscated) and with snipers on rooftops. Err… Malaysia really ain’t that bad after all. \nOn the rooftop of the world \nOur cars finally arrived. Two days later. And so it was finally off to Everest we went. As we approached Rongbuk, Everest revealed herself to us. The night was clear, the moon was full. We couldn’t have asked for a better setting. We were told that it was very rare for people to see Mt. Everest’s north face as she’s covered by clouds most of the time. \nI suppose Qomolangma (Tibetan name for Mt. Everest that means Holy Mother) must have finally thought that we deserved a break and cleared everything for us to witness her splendour and beauty. \nIt was breathtaking. Mind you, the air was thin but the breathlessness was more from the sheer beauty and magnificence of Mt. Everest! \nSo, at the end of the day, what did 3,900km and 15 days on the road teach me? That you can plan the trip but when the trip doesn’t go according to plan, that’s when the adventure starts! \nAlso, the world has so much hidden beauty, and we got to see everything twice (or three times as in the case of Bangda). We only need to open our eyes and our hearts to feel and see it. \nWas the drive worth it you ask? As I always tell people, there must always be one thing that everyone has to try out. This overland thing should be on everyone’s bucket list! \nFor more information on other overland trips, check out this website. I hear next year’s trip is to Africa.
