Reporting from Phoenix, Dallas, London, Barcelona, Singapore, Bangkok, Tokyo, and Honolulu, he will spend only three nights in a real bed, and four nights on flatbed seats, logging more time in airports and aboard planes than not. \nBill will be sharing his observations and assessments. His comments will disclose far more than the mundane details of airline food and seats to reveal the full experience, including upgrade policies, jet lag, and notes on the sights, sounds, and people he encounters. \nAll Commentary by Bill Kizorek: \nWhy am I doing this? At first glance, it seems to be a case of “plane insanity,” but there is a method to the madness. Like anyone else, I want to get as much as I can for my time and money. With five AA flights under my belt before starting this journey—four in first and one in coach—I came away with some immediate impressions. The wine glasses and nut bowls on AA are twice as big as those on UA. The food service on AA, across the board, was superior in terms of variety, amount, taste, and preparation.
