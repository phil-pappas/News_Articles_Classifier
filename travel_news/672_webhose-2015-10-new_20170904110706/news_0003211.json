Waikiki Beach is the main tourist spot on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii and the entire State. \nThis legendary and busy tourist beach was the scene of a third shark attack on Oahu within one week. \nA surfer was attacked on this famous tourist beach at approximately 7.20 pm on Saturday evening, and rushed to a Honolulu hospital in serious condition. \nThis is the second shark attack in a single day on Oahu. Earlier Saturday afternoon, a man was critically injured off of Lanikai Beach in windward Oahu when a tiger shark bit him just above the ankles. \nEight days after a 25-year-old man lost part of his left leg and some of the fingers on his hand in a shark attack off Oahu's north shore. \nThree attacks in 1 week is unusual, since the last attack on Oahu was in 2013. Prior to these three incidents, the last shark attack off Oahu was in 2013. \nIt appears no warning signs have been posted at Waikiki Beach after the attack. Lifeguard stations usually close at 5pm, so it waits to be seen if Waikiki Beach will open on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:30:20.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
