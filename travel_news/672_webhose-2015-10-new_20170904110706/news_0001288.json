At the moment you can barely consider it fit for purpose\nWe are really concerned that this essential doorway into the island could be closed.\nâ€“ Neil Harvey, Chairman of Alderney's Policy and Finance Committee The budget goes before the Sates for deliberation later this month.\nLast updated Thu 8 Oct 2015 Travel Alderney Guernsey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:39:18.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
