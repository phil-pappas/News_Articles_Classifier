Holiday Inn delivered a record level of room openings, and we are expanding our global luxury footprint, particularly in Greater China where nearly a quarter of our 5k room signings in the region were driven by InterContinental Hotels & Resorts.”\nHe added: “We continue to expand the presence of our newer brands, including our second franchise signing for EVEN hotels in the US, and five signings for our industry-leading boutique brands.”\nIHG also announced it’s on track to deliver a next generation Guest Reservation System for roll out in 2017, including development of new cloud based technology.\nIn August, IHG was reportedly ready to bid for rival chains Movenpick and Fairmont.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:16:30.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
