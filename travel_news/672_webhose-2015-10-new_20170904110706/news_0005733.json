It’s contagious. A stroll through her website (and social media feeds) will reveal corners of the world you’ll want to add to your bucket list. Lots of the photos look professional, as if they jumped right off the pages of a magazine.\n>> What’s not: I wanted her to be more personal — put more of herself in her travels — and share more photos that include this mysterious wanderlust-driven explorer. I found a more personal voice on her Twitter feed (@dom_noel) and more photos with her on Instagram (thefrolicker). Trust me, once you see her website, you’ll be following all her accounts.\n———\nJen Leo, Los Angeles Times\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:29:41.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
