This will build on EQi’s work with The Long Run, an initiative of the Zeitz Foundation to develop an impact assessment and communications framework for its membership of nature-based tourism enterprises. \n“This is an exciting opportunity to work in a global industry on a local level to tackle the global sustainability challenge,” says Mr. Burt. “We are proud to be part of The Sun Program to measure environmental problems and meet higher standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.” ￼￼ Professor Geoffrey Lipman, Founder of Greenearth and President of ICTP (International Coalition of Tourism Partners): \n“I am delighted that EQi’s Measurement Technology will be an essential part of SUN’s core focus on Climate Resilience and SDG adaptation – a vital addition to our campaign for full balance sheet Green Growth accounting and Community support systems.” \nThe Sun Program helps further the ICTP vision of helping the vast majority at the base of the travel and tourism pyramid create a simple framework that allows our communities – travelism destinations and stakeholders of residents, visitors and service supply chain – to engage positively in the massive changes that the world is embarked upon. \nEQi is a data and technology company that specialises in resource efficiency management, business intelligence and risk analysis.
