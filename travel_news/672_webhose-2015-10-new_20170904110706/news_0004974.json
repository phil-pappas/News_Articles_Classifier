The current buzzwords? Social change, innovation and community. \n1 Pop-ups all over \nIn postcode 3000, Melbourne's CBD, old buildings – former city hat shops, disused dairies – are being reborn, over and over again, as temporary pop-up stores. From Melbourne's working-class roots comes a thirst for the new, making way for the city's start-up culture and passion for pop-up shops. See broadsheet.com.au/melbourne for current food and wine pops and thethousands.com.au/melbourne for retail, fashion and exhibition pop-ups. \n2 Retail reinvented \nSocial enterprises and businesses offer products or services with the aim of helping to solve a social problem or create social change – everything from providing employment to disadvantaged locals to donating a percentage of sales to improve sanitation in a developing nation. Melbourne has gone mad for social change innovations, particularly in the food space. \nStreat in Melbourne Central helps vulnerable youth obtain hospitality skills. Image: Supplied Ad Feedback \nAmong them is Streat , a cafe which provides hospitality training and support to homeless youth (and serves tasty food too), and Charcoal Lane restaurant, a gateway into the workforce for indigenous Australians. At Lentil As Anything , customers pay what they feel their meal is worth, while earlier this year, an app named Yume was launched to reduce restaurant waste by offering surplus meals to punters for half the price. Visitors can support social enterprises by choosing to eat and shop at them. Drink coffee, change the world. \n3 Sweet pieces \nMelbourne has a strong contemporary design community, in part due to the jewellery design schools there. Contemporary jewellery is hot in Melbourne and among the CBD retail outlets worth a look are e.g.etal , a large downstairs store at 167 Flinders Lane which represents 60 Australian jewellery artists (and a few Kiwis too). Shop for exquisite and unique rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets, brooches ( egetal.com.au ). Gallery Funaki ( galleryfunaki.com.au ) at 4 Crossley St is another driving force in the promotion of contemporary jewellery, presenting at least six solo and curated group exhibitions each year. \nThe focus at Pieces of Eight Gallery ( piecesofeight.com.au ) at 28 Russell Place is on artist-made jewellery and small objects – shop here for unusual and affordable pieces. Camilla Gough works alone in a small studio on Swanston St, creating unique pieces by hand. She works with what she calls \"tiny stories\", producing rings and other items which incorporate places of significance for the wearer into the design, so they become objects of personal significance.

The city is in the grip of a brunch craze and top coffee spots such as Seven Seeds , St Ali and Proud Mary are buzzing. The trend is towards cafe-restaurant hybrids where communal seating and big shared tables are the norm – the cafe as community hub, meeting venue and social incubator all in one. \nMore than ever before, customers are demanding ethical, seasonal, traceable food – right down to the blood lines of the steak on your plate. \"Zero waste\" schemes, where cafes and restaurants return reusable food waste to their suppliers, are also taking off. Even the look of the city's eateries is changing – the love affair with exposed brick giving way to greenery, glass and marble. The hottest place in Melbourne right now? Acclaimed chef Andrew McConnell's newest venture, Supernormal , serving Asian-inspired dishes at 180 Flinders Lane.

In a small workshop crammed with shoe lasts, bike tyres, posters and shelves of stuff up to the ceiling, Brendan Dwyer makes bespoke shoes. After 20 years in the business, he relies mostly on word of mouth and prefers to do all the work himself, making three pairs of shoes a week which sell for between A$400 (NZ$435) and A$2000. \nPart of a small creative and artistic community housed in the landmark Nicholas Building on Swanston St, Dwyer works primarily with kangaroo leather, cow hide and kid skin, English and Italian leather, making shoes for locals as well as clients in Singapore and England. Craft Victoria at 31 Flinders Lane ( craft.org.au ) is a gallery and retail store featuring limited edition functional and decorative objects including textiles, glass, ceramic and timber works. The antithesis of dull and amateurish, \nCraft Victoria showcases the works of Australia's leading designers, as well as new talent. The shed which houses Rose Street Craft Market ( rosestmarket.com.au ) typifies the industrial chic vibe sweeping Melbourne. The weekend market's concrete floors and corrugated iron roof are home to stalls selling handmade cards, clothes and jewellery, limited edition artworks and homewares created by the city's artisans. \nBrendan Dwyer works with kangaroo leather, cow hide and kid skin, English and Italian leather to make exquisite shoes.
