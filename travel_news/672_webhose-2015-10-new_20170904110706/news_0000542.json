Tax reliefs EIS offers a host of reliefs to improve your potential returns including income, capital gains and inheritance tax reliefs. Portfolio objective Rockpool aims to help investors build a diverse portfolio which fits their chosen risk profile. This portfolio consists of four direct private company investments which qualify for the Enterprise Investment Scheme. The investments benfit from EIS tax reliefs. Rockpool contributes to the success of these companies by giving them access to flexible capital and an insightful contact network. We look for profitable companies with proven models. We aim to create a diverse, balanced portfolio. We negotiate terms on behalf of investors and help each company deliver on the agreed investment objectives. Next generation Mr Simons wants to use a Rockpool EIS portfolio to protect his investments from inheritance tax. He also has some gains made over the past three years (£15,000) that he wants to defer from capital gains tax. He makes a net investment of £100,000. This brings him 30 per cent income tax relief of £44,657 and CGT relief of £4,200, which increases his portfolio immediately to £148,857. The investment grows at 5.2 per cent a year. The value of the portfolio when Mr Simons dies 10 years later is £247,131 and there is zero inheritance tax to pay. This compares with a more traditional investment, which would only have grown to £166,019 and would have incurred an IHT bill of £66,408. Mr Simons can therefore pass on £247,131 to his heirs, compared with £99,611 if he had used a traditional investment. Growth Mrs James wants to invest some of her money in growth companies. She invests £50,000 for five years. Of this, £10,000 are previous gains that she can shelter from CGT in the EIS. Income and capital gains tax reliefs make her starting portfolio £75,429. The investments do well and Mrs James’ portfolio grows at 6.5 per cent a year. After five years, the EIS leaves her with a total of £103,344 compared with £68,504 if she had used a traditional investment. Exit focus Mr Olazabal wants an investment with a predictable exit as soon as possible after the minimum holding period of three years, to minimise risk. He invests £20,000 with no capital gains to protect and 30 per cent tax relief increases his initial investment to £28,571. The investments grow at 6 per cent a year and he exits after four years. At that time, Mr Olazabal’s investment has grown to £36,071 compared with a traditional investment, which would have grown to £25,250. • To find out more about private investment opportunities, visit Rockpool.uk.com Please note: your capital is at risk and there is no guarantee of return.
