A remarkable Attic red-figure vase with a scene of the murder of the Trojan king, Priam, during the sack of the city shows a palm tree in the sanctuary of Artemis seeming dramatically to drop its head, lamenting the slaughter.

Images of the gods personifying various aspects of nature were far more sophisticated than the artistic representation of the reality of the natural world. Credit National Archaeological Museum, Naples The discovery of the royal tombs in Vergina in Macedonia in the late 1970s, including that of Philip II, father of Alexander the Great, brought to light a fresco of a hunting scene in a skillfully executed landscape setting, with subtle shadings and an assured grasp of perspective. This explosion of artistic interest in the natural world during the Hellenistic period was later to influence Roman art, with the city of Alexandria a particularly important point of contact. Weaving simple crowns of foliage was already an established practice, but during the Hellenistic era the finest goldsmiths applied their art to mimicking the wreaths with incredible delicacy in gold. Seven of these exquisite pieces are on display in Milan, four from southern Italy and three from Macedonia. The increasing appreciation of nature gave rise to a new passion for gardens and, in due course, illusionistic painted gardens on the walls of villas. One of the most enchanting surviving examples of these are the detached frescoes from the House of the Golden Bracelet at Pompeii, now on loan in Milan. These scenes were not the work of famous artists, but the level of observation is impressive, with numerous tree, plant and bird species lovingly and convincingly reproduced. As an addition to the exhibition, visitors can pass from the section displaying the House of the Golden Bracelet frescoes into the rear courtyard of the Palazzo Reale to stroll around a verdant recreation of a typical Roman viridarium, or garden. This project, based on a study of the frescoes, is the work of the Orticola di Lombardia, a horticultural society that dates back to 1865. The final sections of the show are devoted to the flowering of Roman landscape and still-life painting. Some of the most celebrated surviving examples feature the “country houses, ports, landscapes, sacred woods, groves, hills, ponds, canals, rivers, shores” that Pliny the Elder described in such wall paintings. A number of these exhibits relate ancient myths — the episode of Ulysses and the Laestrygonians, the slaughter of the children of Niobe, and Perseus’s rescue of Andromeda, for instance — but often these subjects form a relatively small part of the compositions, which were primarily intended to decorate interior living spaces. Subgenres also emerged, such as riverside and maritime city views, including scenes of the Nile with pygmies struggling with crocodiles and hippos. There are also some beautiful monochrome paintings, including a finely painted ochre vignette of a rural temple and a deep blue vista of boats sailing on Lake Garda, from the so-called Villa of the Caves of Catullus at Sirmione. Still-lifes also became popular, celebrating the bounty of nature in providing for the table. A dozen detached fresco panels from Pompeii and Herculaneum contain fish, fowl, eggs, grapes, apples, figs, dates and peaches (a Roman good-luck gift). The stripping of a layer of varnish, applied in the 18th century and since decayed, has restored to vibrancy an uncannily modern-looking ensemble of an elegant carafe of rosé with a golden loaf of bread.
