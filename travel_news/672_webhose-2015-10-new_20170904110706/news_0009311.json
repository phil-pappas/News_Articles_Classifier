Abrams, who helmed the last two \"Star Trek\" films and shot parts of the upcoming \"Star Wars: Episode VII\" in Abu Dhabi. The city was also a location for the most recent \"Fast & Furious\" sequel.\nChernov also was an executive producer in 2011's \"Mission: Impossible â€” Ghost Protocol,\" which saw actor Tom Cruise scale parts of Dubai's Burj Khalifa skyscraper for the movie. Speaking Wednesday to journalists with other cast members in Dubai, Chernov said filmmakers found Dubai's skyscrapers and futuristic vistas appealing.\nOn Friday, authorities in Dubai shut down busy Sheikh Zayed Road for a film shoot. A helicopter filmed along the multi-lane highway cutting through the heart of Dubai, which includes a portion of the Dubai Metro and tall residential towers and office buildings.\nActor Chris Pine, who plays Capt. James T. Kirk in the rebooted films, described opening up the blinds of his hotel room to look out on \"such a stunning city.\"\n\"It looks like whatever tomorrow will be,\" Pine said. \"It's future land. It's incredible.\"\nOther actors involved in \"Star Trek Beyond,\" directed by Justin Lin, include Idris Elba, Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg. The film is set for release in July.\n___\nFollow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellap.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:39:23.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
