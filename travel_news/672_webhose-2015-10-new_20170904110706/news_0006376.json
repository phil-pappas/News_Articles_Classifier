Please call me on 01865 425366 / / Travel Share 0 comments \nKatherine MacAlister and family head to London for a busy weekend organised by the children \nNever in a million years would I have chosen to go on the London Eye on a Saturday afternoon when it was so crammed with tourists you could scarcely breath. \nNeither would I have ventured anywhere near Planet Hollywood to eat steak, China Town to try seaweed at a rotating table, or Shaftesbury Avenue waiting for Matilda the Musical to start. \nBut that’s kids for you. \nThey take you right out of your comfort zone and force you to try all manner of new things. \nThe blow was cushioned somewhat by the offer of a night at the Jumeirah Carlton Hotel in Belgravia, in a family room, arriving via the Oxford Tube at Marble Arch just after lunch on Saturday. \nSuitably impressed, our junior suite rendered even my seven-year-old speechless, which was quite something. \nIt also provided the perfect retreat from the busy streets of London’s top tourist destinations, so that when things got too much we could retire to the tree-lined sunny streets of Knightsbridge and a bit of calm. \nWith a schedule busier than Cameron’s spin doctors to maintain, sadly there was little time to spare to admire the fantastic views from our room, the toiletries in the opulent bathroom or bounce on the bed and reluctantly we had to leave the spacious hotel suite, whose clever use of the sofa bed for the kids still left us lots of room. \nBeing so central, we walked everywhere from The Jumeirah, starting off with the usual tourist spots – the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, then off to the London Eye where we queued for ages, despite booking a place, but once whisked up into the air, those amazing views stretching out before us, made us forget all the hustle and bustle instantly. Promoted stories \nCalmer when we landed, we strolled up the South Bank, taking in a comedy festival and fairground rides en route, before wandering onto one of the sunlit boats moored alongside the Thames where we enjoyed a cold drink while watching all the river activity. \nAnd then we were off again, this time to China Town where we watched the fantastic array of metallic human statues keeping the kids entertained while we chose a restaurant. \nThey all looked pretty much the same, but after eating our own body weight in crispy Peking duck, the night darkened and we made our way back to the Jumeirah, brightening up on the way when we remembered where we were staying. \nAnd it was lovely to retire somewhere so comfortable, where every need had been taken care of, the staff were charming and nothing was too much trouble, sleep not being a problem after such a busy day. \nGetting up was even easier, with the prospect of breakfast to lure us. \nBeing some of the first ones downstairs, (that’s kids for you) meant we had the breakfast buffet to ourselves and dined out on the fresh fruit, pastries, yoghurts and full English, pancakes, waffles... shall I stop? \nSuffice to say the kids were in heaven. \nWe then took in the V&A, where we saw the new Shoe exhibition and caught the end of the Alexander McQueen retrospective (which has now sadly finished), Mr Greedy sensibly staying in the foyer reading the paper while we whirled excitedly around gazing in in awe at all the footwear and fashion, lapping it all up, before emerging blinking into the sunlight again and finding ourselves inexplicably hungry. \nPlanet Hollywood was the request. \nI had never been, accidentally on purpose. \nBut this wasn’t my weekend, it was theirs and the kids wanted everything on the menu. \nThey filled up on enormous milkshakes, burgers and pizzas while staring at all the celebrity paraphernalia and screenings of classic films from Terminator to Back to The Future. \nThe whole of the top floor was rammed with foreign students, and we were lucky to get a table, to give you an idea of its continuing popularity. \nAnd finally, the long walk up Shaftesbury Avenue to see Matilda The Musical. \nIt was a wonderful adaption of Roald Dahl’s classic book, and much less scary than the film, we were relieved to find. \nHaving left all our luggage at the hotel, we wondered slowly back, admiring the supercars and multi-million pound houses en route before finding the Jumeirah, our own little parcel of temporary luxury. \nIt was hard to leave, even though our bus was waiting just round the corner. \nBut that weekend will stay with us for ever, a reminder never to get stuck in your ways and always try new places, however old you are.
