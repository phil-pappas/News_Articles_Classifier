Best route for Madurai, Hampi, F Cochin.. # 1 I'm planning a two week trip to South India in the New Year. There's lots I'd like to see but I think I'll limit it to just a few destinations. I enjoy long train journeys and I'm happy to take buses and cabs. I'd rather not take internal flights. Anyway, I'm thinking I'd like to see Madurai, Hampi, Fort Cochin & the Keral backwaters but I'm not sure of the best way to get between the destinations. I can fly in and out of different cities. What's the most logical route, do you think? Many thanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:52:47.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
