And there’s no better collection of trails than those that wend their way through Europe, tracing nearly every type of terrain imaginable, from the fjords of Scandinavia to the peaks of the Alps. While many trails on the Continent are worthy of considerations, this list contains only the most iconic, dramatic, and beautiful hikes. None of these routes are necessarily easy to tackle, but the challenge is part of the fun. \nby Jayme Moye Sign in to leave a comment \nclumsy_plumsy on October 14, 2015 at 2:41:10 PM EDT \nWhoa nice list, definitely the most iconic hikes. The only one I would personally add is the coast-to-coast hike in England, through the Yorkshire Dales & Lake District. Maybe also the GR5 from the Alps to the Mediterranean (which I've always wanted to do). But very good list all the same.
