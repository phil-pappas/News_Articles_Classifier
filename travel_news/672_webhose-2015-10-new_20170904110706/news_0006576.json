Zumba Fitness instructors brought a mix of low-intensity and high-intensity moves for an interval-style, calorie-burning dance fitness party.\nAccording to Cancer Research UK’s website, “An analysis combining the results of 31 studies on physical activity and breast cancer found that the women who did the most activity had a 12% lower risk of developing breast cancer compared with the least active women. The analysis also showed that the more activity a woman does, the more she can reduce her risk of breast cancer. For example, for every 2 hours a week a woman spends doing moderate to vigorous activity, the risk of breast cancer falls by 5%”. Taking this into consideration the event aimed to raise awareness of a healthy lifestyle to travellers.\nThe event took place within Heathrow Terminal 2: The Queen’s Terminal underneath Richard Wilson’s Slipstream, where more than 6.2 million passengers on 41,481 flights pass through every day. A 90ft pink ribbon has also installed on the terminal building windows for the month of October.\nThe 2015 Estée Lauder Companies BCA Campaign empowers women, men and families around the world to take action to help defeat breast cancer through the universal call-to-action “Every Action Counts. What’s Yours?” The BCA Campaign invites people to share all the meaningful ways they take action on BCAcampaign.com and social media channels, and support lifesaving breast cancer research by making a donation to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation® (BCRF).\nEach of our actions—big or small—counts in the fight against breast cancer. For every action submitted on BCAcampaign.com or unique post on Instagram or Twitter with #BCAstrength between October 1, 2015 and World Cancer Day on February 4, 2016, The Estée Lauder Companies will donate $25 to fund a half-hour of breast cancer research through BCRF, with the goal of funding up to 500 research hours ($25,000) through the support of our global digital community.\nThe BCA Campaign supports BCRF by raising awareness and funding for its research grantmaking program, which advances the most promising, innovative breast cancer research worldwide. Funds are raised through The Estée Lauder Companies’ employee activities, Pink Ribbon Product sales, contributions from many of The Estée Lauder Companies’ iconic brands and donations made on BCAcampaign.com. The limited edition Estée Lauder Pink Ribbon Products will be available at World Duty Free stores at Heathrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:51:01.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
