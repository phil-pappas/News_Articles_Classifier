This is a major change from the previous 30% accessibility, just over 10 years ago. \nAmong the newly opened areas will be the western section of Imperial Palace compound, which houses the renowned Cining and Shoukang Palaces and served as home to China’s ancient empresses; the section will be open for the first time in 90 years. \nSeveral other areas of historic architecture are also being restored in preparation for the wider opening, and previously private ancillary facilities are being revamped to use as display areas for thousands of pieces of Ming and Qing Dynasty furniture and artifacts. \nIn addition, parking spots and car lots that are currently located within the Palace Museum grounds will be moved outside the walls of the museum, making the area completely pedestrian only. \nThese changes are in addition to other efforts made recently to reduce overcrowding and improve guest experiences at the Palace Museum (such as online ticket purchases, limited number of visitors per day, ongoing restorations and new exhibits, and better signage and accessibility).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:59:56.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
