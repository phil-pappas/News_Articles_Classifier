We will not be able to negotiate the same costs for fuel, for maintenance, for IT systems and for everything else. And, in an industry driven first and foremost by cost and pricing, this means we shall never be able to compete effectively,” she said. Therefore, Air Malta would definitely gain advantages from a potential strategic alliance to beat the challenges brought by the lack of economies of scale the airline has at the moment.” \nMs Micallef emphasised that during the last six months of the Restructuring Plan all stakeholders must show how much they care about the airline. \n“Let us work hand in hand to achieve a result we can all be proud of. We cannot afford any personal interest or stubbornness if we want to achieve this. Let us instead be the stakeholders of a small country who came together when it mattered most, to achieve something beyond the reach of much larger countries. Let us show we care more.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:00:11.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
