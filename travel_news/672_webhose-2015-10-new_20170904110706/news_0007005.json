One lucky Telegraph reader will win a pair of tickets to the final, courtesy of DHL, the Official Logistics Partner of Rugby World Cup 2015.

Throughout the tournament DHL will be transporting more than 48 tons of equipment for all 20 participating nations – from match kit and scrum machines to tackle bags and ice baths – across 89 team base locations and 13 match venues. The company’s support also includes stadium infrastructure and fit-out, fulfillment of international ticket distribution and delivery of doping samples to testing laboratories, among many other requirements. DHL has also searched the globe to find 48 children who each delivered the official match ball to a Rugby World Cup 2015 match. Nine-year-old English schoolgirl Rosie Rogers has this honour for the final, having won a competition through The Telegraph. You can be a winner, too, thanks to DHL.
