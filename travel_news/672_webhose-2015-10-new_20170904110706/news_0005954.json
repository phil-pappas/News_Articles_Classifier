A question that cut through spin, verbiage and deceit to give you an honest answer as to how someone might vote. The question was: \"Which leader would you most like to have a beer with?\" \nBrilliant. A question that let you know immediately how \"likeable\" a candidate was. \nCandidates who did well with the beer question always did well on Election Day. Jean Chretien was everyone's favourite drinking buddy. People could imagine Ralph Klein buying a round for the table. Ditto for Jack Layton. The likeability of Layton -- who always topped the-beer-with-a-politician poll -- was one of the reasons the NDP did so well in the last federal election. Maybe the most important reason. \nSo it's a great question. Although it may have had its day. \nAs Canada becomes more culturally diverse -- and healthier for that matter -- the question doesn't resonate the same way. And if you start to exclude people who would never drink a beer, what sort of poll are you left with? \nSo we need a new beer question. Something that will let pollsters know -- without coming right out and asking the question -- just how likeable a politician is. \nAnd I think Travelzoo has found it. Their question --asked of 862 Canadian adults in an online poll between Sept. 5 and 14 -- was this: \"Which federal leader would you most like to go on a road trip with?\" \nBrilliant. The beer question without any of the problems. \nJustin Trudeau was the winner of the poll, with 42% of the vote. Stephen Harper was second with 25%, Elizabeth May came in third with 20% and Tom Mulcair was left sitting by himself in a rumble-seat somewhere, at 10%. \nMay's strong showing is somewhat surprising (people must be assuming she will not be driving), but the rest of the numbers are probably not a surprise. \nTrudeau does seem the most likeable of the leaders. So likeable, the Conservatives and NDP have never really tried to dispute this fact, but have tried to spin likeability into something negative -- the boy is vacuous, simple, lacks gravitas and so on. \nBut Trudeau has not self-destructed during the campaign -- as many had hoped and expected. He's still standing. Still likeable road-trip material. \nI think this spells trouble for the Conservatives and the NDP. In an election without a galvanizing single issue, likeability becomes more important. \nBy the way, it gets no better for the Tories if they hop a plane: 41% of Travelzoo respondents said they would prefer a parachute to sitting next to Stephen Harper.
