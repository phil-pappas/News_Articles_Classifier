Additionally, the line recognized for serving the finest cuisine at sea will transform the Grand Dining Room into Jacques Bistro for lunch, offering an exclusive menu featuring some of legendary chef Jacques Pépin’s signature dishes.\nThe overwhelming popularity of Red Ginger and Jacques on the line’s recent new builds, Marina and Riviera, led Oceania Cruises to add variations of these remarkable dining experiences to the more intimate, 684-guest Sirena.\n“The addition of Tuscan Steak, Red Ginger and Jacques Bistro to Sirena further exemplifies our commitment to epicurean excellence and steadfast focus on serving our guests the finest cuisine at sea,” said Jason Montague, president and chief operating officer for Oceania Cruises. “These new dining experiences, along with Sirena’s collection of unique, destination-rich itineraries will provide guests with another exciting choice within the Oceania Cruises’ portfolio.”\nSirena will be the first ship in the Oceania Cruises fleet to offer this collection of exquisite dining options, providing guests with new culinary indulgences to explore.\nTuscan Steak, a completely new restaurant concept inspired by both Oceania Cruises’ traditional steak house, Polo Grill, and the line’s authentic Italian restaurant, Toscana, is destined to become an instant classic. The innovative and diverse menu offers succulent steaks and seafood with a Tuscan flair, cooked to perfection and expertly served in an elegant, contemporary setting. Its eclectic menu will offer authentic favorites that celebrate the passion and tradition of Italian dining, while continuing to offer savory steakhouse fare. Among its varied and delectable offerings will be the signature Tuscan porterhouse, bistecca alla fiorentina; iberico de bellota pork chop with gaeta black olives; and Maine lobster fra diavolo.\nFeaturing glossy wood paneling with a platinum and silver color scheme and hardwood floors, the motif at Tuscan Steak is a modernized treatment of the classic steakhouse. Adorning the entrance will be a stunning wine cellar featuring an extensive selection of the fine vintages to perfectly complement the meal.\nRed Ginger, the beloved contemporary Asian-inspired restaurant currently available on Marina and Riviera, will offer familiar culinary delights such Miso Glazed Sea Bass and Lobster Pad Thai. The restaurant’s décor features vibrant red crystal chandeliers, ebony wood furnishings and a striking collection of modern Asian artwork. The stylish, contemporary décor is a study in feng shui, and perfectly complements the restaurant’s Pan-Asian cuisine.\nAvailable for lunch, Jacques Bistro will transport guests to an authentic Parisian bistro in Sirena’s Grand Dining Room. Inspired by Oceania Cruises’ Executive Culinary Director and world-renowned Master Chef Jacques Pépin’s namesake restaurant on Marina and Riviera, the bistro will offer simple and elegant French fare. As evidenced by its hand-written chalkboard displaying the day’s specialty items, Jacques Bistro will convey a comfortable and warm mid-day charm.\nThe menu at Jacques Bistro will be seasonal in nature, with its hot weather menu focused on grilled and short-cooked fare, and its cold weather menu featuring more sauce- and stew-oriented dishes. Menu highlights include lemon sole fillet with seafood cream sauce, free-range chicken fricassee, and braised oxtail terrine.\nFinest Cuisine at Sea … and More\nThe 684-passenger Sirena will offer diverse and destination-rich itineraries appealing to both seasoned world travelers and passionate cruisers who crave a more intimate and luxurious cruise experience. Before entering service the ship will be elevated to Oceania Cruises’ standard of elegance by undergoing a 35-day, $40 million refurbishment. The ship’s decks will be resplendent in the finest teak, custom stone and tile work; and its lounges, suites and staterooms will be completely refreshed, including major design changes to the Owner’s Suites, Vista Suites and Horizons Lounge.\nFollowing the award-winning design blueprint of its sister ships Regatta, Insignia and Nautica, Sirena will feature a world-class fitness center and spa, six lounges and bars, a casino, and 342 lavish suites and luxurious staterooms, nearly 70% of which feature private verandas.\nSirena is scheduled to enter service on April 27, 2016 with an extraordinary 14-night cruise from Barcelona to Venice. During its inaugural season, the ship will feature a mix of classic destinations and exotic new ports of call, including the famed beaches of Gaeta, Italy; the pristine rainforest of Golfito, Costa Rica; and the well-preserved provincial township of La Paz, Mexico.\nThe recent expansion of OLife Advantage, the line’s early booking incentive program, provides guests who book any suite or stateroom category on Sirena or any of its sister ships by Dec. 31, 2015 with numerous complimentary amenities, including free shore excursions, unlimited Internet and pre-paid gratuities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:10:25.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
