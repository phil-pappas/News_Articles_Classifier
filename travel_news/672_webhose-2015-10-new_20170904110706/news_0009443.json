LOUIS , Oct. 12, National Car Rental and Enterprise Rent-A-Car are the top two preferred car rental brands for business travel, according to a recent survey. In fact, the National and Enterprise brands placed first and second overall and in six of the seven categories.\n\"Our National and Enterprise brands each serve different types of customers in the car rental market, but together they provide a cohesive and seamless business rental solution,\" said Brad Carr , vice president of Business Sales for Enterprise Holdings, which owns and operates the National and Enterprise brands. \"These survey results support our commitment to add value as a travel supplier by meeting the unique travel needs of each of our partners.\"\nBusiness Travel News' inaugural Car Rental Brand and Ground Transportation Survey asked corporate travel buyers about their perceptions and satisfaction levels with their travel suppliers. Respondents only evaluated those brands with which they had done a significant amount of business in the past year, and did so in seven categories: price flexibility; amenity and service flexibility; vehicle condition; complaint resolution; communication; and the relationship between account managers and sales representatives.\nAmong their responses, corporate travel buyers highlighted National's Emerald Aisle and both brands' commitment to customer service as differentiators. In fact, Business Travel News reported that one survey respondent said of National, \"They are truly a partner that looks out for our best interest.\"\nEnterprise Holdings is the largest car rental service provider in the world as measured by revenue, employees and fleet. Through its regional subsidiaries, Enterprise Holdings operates the largest fleet of vehicles in the world – more than 1.7 million – and a global network of more than 9,000 fully staffed neighborhood and airport locations in more than 70 countries. The company ranks near the top of the global travel industry , ahead of many airlines and most cruise lines, hotels, tour operators and online travel agencies.\nEnterprise Holdings gives both small and large businesses the service, value and convenience they expect from the brands they've come to know and trust – and also provides the most comprehensive business rental solution in the marketplace. Through more than 6,200 locations within 15 miles of 90 percent of the U.S. population, Enterprise Holdings' extensive neighborhood and airport network is uniquely positioned to provide customers with unmatched access to new rental vehicles and a renowned customer service experience.\nAs part of its commitment to exceeding customer expectations, Enterprise Holdings' fleet is among the car rental industry's newest and provides late-model, well-maintained vehicles with an average odometer reading of 16,000 miles and an age of eight months.\nIn a Business Travel News interview earlier this year, Enterprise Holdings' Chief Strategy Officer Greg Stubblefield stressed, \"We spent an enormous sum of money building the infrastructure for National, and you can see it in the customer satisfaction scores.\"\nThe National and Enterprise brands also recently ranked at the top of the Travel + Leisure World's Best Awards in the car rental category, as well as received Travel Weekly Magellan Awards for their mobile app and the Exotic Car Collection by Enterprise.\nFor more information on business rentals, visit www.drivealliance.com/business/ .
