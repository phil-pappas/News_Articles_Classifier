But restaurateur Danny Meyer’s announcement today that his 13 New York City restaurants will eliminate tipping by late 2016 may be the beginning of an industry-wide shift.\nWhile some restaurants have instituted no-tipping expected policies—Thomas Keller’s Per Se did in 2005, though the bill still has a line for an additional gratuity—the practice is certainly the exception, not the rule. Meyer’s Manhattan locations joining the list (The Modern will begin next month, with others to follow) still represent a minute fraction of the city’s thousands of eateries, but for a big name to make such a public statement is significant.\nOne big driver behind Meyer’s “Hospitality Included” plan, according to Eater , is to both increase wages and provide more consistent wages for his employees. Waiters’ livelihoods depend on fluctuating tips, while cooks’ often-low wages are not supplemented by the gratuities. The result is financial uncertainty as well as a shortage of cooks in cities with high costs of living. A more steady revenue stream would, in theory, raise all ships.\nIn order to do this, it might be assumed that food prices would increase 15 to 20 percent, in line with the traditional tip amount. But they are likely to go up 30 or 35 percent. Meyer explains in the article that the additional cost will be to “right what has been a labor of wrong”—largely referring to the resulting increase in wages for all employees. Though short-term, Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group is hoping to keep the price increase of approximately 20 percent. What would that look like for the average plate?\nFor the three-course dinner menu at Gramercy Tavern , the price jumps from $92 to around $110; the signature roasted suckling pig at Maialino from $42 for the smaller size to just under $51; and a martini at Porchlight goes from $14 to almost $17. Perhaps once the up-front sticker shock subsides, not having to calculate a tip will be a relief. Though diners might also find it frustrating to lose the ability to “reward” or “punish” waiters with their gratuity. But perhaps in an era when patrons care deeply about the provenance and treatment of each and every ingredient on their plates, it is time for that kindness to extend to the people preparing and serving the food as well.", "external_links": ["http://ny.eater.com/2015/10/14/9517747/danny-meyer-no-tipping-restaurants#_intro", "http://www.gramercytavern.com/", "http://www.ushgnyc.com/news/archives/announcements/a-letter-from-danny-meyer/", "http://maialinonyc.com/", "http://porchlightbar.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:04:02.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
