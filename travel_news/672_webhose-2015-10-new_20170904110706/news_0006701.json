On Friday, the People’s Bank of China cut interest rates for the sixth time in nearly a year, while the European Central Bank hinted on Thursday at potentially expanding its monetary stimulus.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, -1.10% dropped 2.1 basis points to 2.062%, according to Tradeweb. One basis point is equal to one hundredth of a percentage point.\nThe yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -1.06% lost 2.9 basis points to 2.869% and, among shorter maturities, the yield on the two-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.00% inched 0.4 basis point lower to 0.637%.\nBond yields fall when prices rise, and vice versa.\n“While the Fed meeting is certainly high on the importance list, the odds of outright action are virtually nil. If anything, we anticipate language on imported deflation in the economic comments will tilt towards the dovish side,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, in a note.\nInstead, this week’s economic calendar could prove much more significant for the future outlook of U.S. interest rates, interest-rates strategists said.\nThe busy calendar will feature reports on new home sales, durable goods orders and consumer confidence data, ahead of the Fed’s meeting, which is scheduled to end Wednesday afternoon with the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy statement.\n“The housing sector is on solid footing and generating steady price increases. Outside of housing, however, the economy slowed in [the third quarter] and manufacturing remained sluggish,” said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, in a note.\nThe first reading of third-quarter gross domestic product growth, expected on Thursday, holds the greatest importance for the interest-rate outlook.\nIn Europe, government bond yields edged lower after last week’s strong rally fueled by the ECB’s hints of more easing measures.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year German bond TMBMKDE-10Y, -3.98% known as the bund, inched 1.3 basis point lower to 0.510% after falling last week to its lowest level in nearly five months.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:46:01.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
