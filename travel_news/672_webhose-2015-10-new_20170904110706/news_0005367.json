A mysterious nomadic clan called The Travelers are coming, and they’re bringing their magical BloodMoon Faire™ to the Los Angeles area in October 2016. A new and unique dark fantasy festival, featuring the World’s First Crowdsourced Haunted House, will materialize to thrill guests with an immersive creepy atmosphere, games, food and interactive entertainment.\nA highly-themed new Halloween event that will feature attractions such as nightly parades, haunted attractions, staged entertainment, wandering characters and creatures, and incredible artisans and vendors, The BloodMoon Faire will be family friendly during the day and get spookier as the sun goes down. Also, if you’re paying close enough attention, you’ll be witness to a dramatic story playing out across the faire, starring the entire cast of mysterious characters.\nThe Prime Cast\nThe stars of the show are referred to as the Prime Cast and consist of The Queen, The Siren & The Villain, also known as Rosella, Viktoria Diamond and Balthazar Von Pumpernickel III, respectively. The diabolical Balthazar is after Queen Rosella’s throne, and lounge singer Viktoria Diamond is stuck in the middle. This story will be presented in snippets throughout the day where scenes will appear in random places at random times for attentive guests to enjoy.\nFundraising Campaign\nFirst, though, The Travelers need to scare up some dough to make it happen. For that, organizers have turned to the popular crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. Event producer, Troy Yu, explains why: “We’ve always wanted this to be a really unique and special event focusing on integrating the community. We’re working with many different charity and non-profit organizations to make that happen, and now we’re looking for help from individuals to get us off the ground,” he said.\nThe goal of the crowdfunding campaign is to raise $100,000 by November 8th, 2015. In return for contributing (also known as “backing”), contributors (also known as “backers”) can choose a number of rewards exclusive to this fundraiser, such as VIP benefits, discounted early-bird tickets, and a unique package that allows the backer to choose their allegiance to one of the Prime characters and gain access to exclusive clubhouses and items - Are you honest and loyal? You might swear allegiance to The Queen. Are you diabolical and evil? You’re probably best in the League of Night, led by The Villain. If you’re the creative type, The Bohemians are for you, who follow The Siren. There’s something for everyone - even those who can’t attend the Faire can contribute and have their name in lights at the event.\nAs with most crowdfunding on Kickstarter, if the campaign does not meet the goal by the deadline, the BloodMoon Faire will not receive any funds and no backer will be charged, so there is no risk to the customer.\n“We really hope that our fellow Halloween enthusiasts will come out and help us meet our goal. This kind of event is a huge challenge to produce and we need all the support we can get,” said Troy. “Even $5 will help - and we’ve got some awesome stretch goals planned if we exceed our goal. We’re talking about upgrading from porta-potties to real flush toilets if we can get enough support. What other festival has ever offered that for it’s guests?”\nBackers can contribute to the Kickstarter campaign by visiting http://kck.st/1NCJEIF\nThe BloodMoon Faire will run October 1st - 31st 2016.\nThe Faire will also feature the Worlds First Croudsourced Haunted Attraction™ where each room in the haunted house will be designed by a different community artist in competition for a $5000 grand prize.\nMore information can be found at the official website - www.BloodMoonFaire.com\n78 Entertainment Group is a multimedia entertainment production company specializing in live events and haunted attractions.
