Share article \n“We have carefully analysed casualty data and have selected the most appropriate sites to be part of the upgrade programme. \n“We hope that the presence of our new cameras will encourage drivers to change their behaviour and drive at lower, safer speeds.” Promoted Stories New super speed cameras hit Hampshire roads   Big Mac 10:51am Mon 26 Oct 15 \nMaybe useful in capturing the morons than just wonder across the road with their headphones on whilst checking their mobiles Maybe useful in capturing the morons than just wonder across the road with their headphones on whilst checking their mobiles Big Mac \nMaybe useful in capturing the morons than just wonder across the road with their headphones on whilst checking their mobiles Report Score: 8 justice4taxis 11:18am Mon 26 Oct 15 \nOne of the ones in Kingsway is actually hidden behind a tree.
