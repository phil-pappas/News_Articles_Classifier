She went into it the strongest, kept it together and didn’t seem to make any errors compared to Ian and Tamal, who were so nervous they got things wrong. Ian forgot the sugar in his iced buns and the orange in his carrot cakes and Tamal seemed to lose his confidence – he made that plain royal icing for his iced buns, which needed a flavour to cut through the sweetness, and instead of rough puff pastry he made a traditional puff for his mille-feuille. Paul gets a moutful of Nadiya's buns Photo: BBC I wouldn’t have predicted Nadiya winning at the beginning of the series, though. When she came last in the technical bake in the first week, I wouldn’t have imagined her in the final, but as the weeks went on she grew. She’s obviously a very determined young lady and did her practice. Other bakers admitted they hadn’t practised certain things, but Nadiya can’t be faulted. She’s a worthy winner. She worked hard for it. Nadiya adjusts her spirit level Photo: BBC The bakers will be very tired by this time. By the end I don’t think I could have carried on any longer. The final is incredibly hard because you’re not just left to bake; you’re being interrupted all the time for interviews and judging. As soon as you make a mistake or start running out of time you’ve got cameras around you and people asking what you’re going to do. It’s hard to concentrate. I did think the brief for this year’s showstopper was easier than last year. The classic British cake of at least three tiers, all in the same flavour, was simpler than last year’s pièce montée, which was incredibly hard – it had to incorporate cake, biscuits, choux pastry, caramel and petit fours and it had to be 30cm tall. I remember Paul Hollywood saying last year during the series, “This lot are so good”, and if the bakers are good the challenges need to be hard, so maybe there was an element of that. When the winner is announced, it’s done outdoors where the garden party with friends and family has been going on for hours. We’d already taken out our showstoppers after they’d been judged, and there was nothing but crumbs left. Paul, Mary, Mel and Sue stand there in front of you and go, ‘And the winner is…’ I remember focusing on a tree on the horizon and thinking, “What will be will be.” Then that’s it – you have a month where nothing happens before it goes on air, and you can’t tell anyone how far you got in the competition – I had to tell my 12-year-old grandson, Ethan, who saw me win, that if he told anyone they’d send the police around! nancybirtwhistle.co.uk ; @nancybbakes Interactive: Bake Off Winners TelegraphEnts Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:40:05.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
