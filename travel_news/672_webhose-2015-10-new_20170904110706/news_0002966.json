The marina side restaurant, which is named after the longitude and latitude of Barbados, has a beautiful setting overlooking the turquoise waters of the marina and is already receiving excellent reviews on Trip Advisor for its impressive menus and first class service and ambiance.\n13˚/59˚is run by Executive Head Chef Andrew Turner, formerly of Michelin starred restaurant, ‘Chapter One’, in Dublin. Andrew was trained in London under Marco Pierre White and later ran his own fine dining restaurant in the Sydney Opera House and went on to head Michelin star restaurants in Ireland.\nAndrew‘s menus use the natural ingredients of the four corners of Barbados and its surrounding ocean, in contemporary and innovative style, backed by an exceptional wine list. UNNA’s motto is ‘Luxury with Soul’ and Andrew and Executive Sous Chef Roz Allen have embraced this in creating dishes that that are as beautiful to look at, as they are to eat. Patrons may choose from the ‘Short Menu’ of five courses, or The ‘Long Menu’ featuring a ten-course extravaganza of tasting dishes; a vegetable tasting menu option is also available. A new Sunday brunch menu, accompanied by live jazz, is also proving popular.\nThe interior of 13˚/59˚ is a lesson in refined luxury and understated sophistication, decorated in a muted neutral palette with accents of polished wood, akin to a club lounge on a luxury yacht. Panels of gleaming finely polished wood are inlaid in the walls, while the floors feature Casablanca Hones Limestone tiles. The open kitchen and bar area are faced with a beautiful feature wall of ornamental granite and coral stone render. Dining alcoves, nestled within great curved glass windows, offer seating in a climate controlled environment without sacrificing on the sea views, alternatively, patrons may choose to reserve an outdoor dockside table, just feet from the water.\nCommenting on the launch of 13˚/59˚, Alistair Brown, sales and marketing director for UNNA, comments, ‘Our ethos in opening 13˚/59˚ is to deliver a restaurant of international standard, combining the beautiful ingredients that Barbados has to offer, with modern cookery methods, and we’re delighted to have a chef of Andy’s calibre to help us devise our menu of constantly evolving tasting dishes, with an imaginative and interesting style. We’ve only been open for a short time but we’re finding that the restaurant is providing a real draw as a new foodie destination on the island.’\nSource:- Port Ferdinand Marina and Luxury Residences", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:31:17.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
