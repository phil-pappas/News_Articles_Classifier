The analysis revealed no significant difference in actual crash rates between small carriers and those with 20 or more roadside inspections.\nFMCSA's examinations further determined that the category of carriers with 11-20 inspections and patterns of non-compliance has the highest crash rates, presenting a clear and immediate intervention opportunity for the agency to proactively bring these carriers into compliance with important safety regulations, including: hours-of-service limitations designed to prevent fatigued driving; vehicle maintenance, and; commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements.\nFMCSA's current SMS data sufficiency standards allow the agency to effectively identify and proactively intervene with high-risk carriers before a crash involving a large truck or bus occurs.\nIn March, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the agency increase the minimum number of required roadside safety inspections needed before prioritizing truck and bus companies for interventions. FMCSA disagreed, pointing out that a delay in responding to known non-compliant carriers would needlessly jeopardize the safety of the motoring public.\nUnder current Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs), a carrier's safety fitness can only be assigned following an on-site investigation; SMS is a tool to prioritize high-risk truck and bus companies for enforcement interventions.\nToday's report underscores the critical importance of considering carriers of all sizes in the agency's continuing efforts to remove unsafe carriers and commercial drivers from the nation's roadways and protecting travelers everywhere.\nFor a copy of today's report, see:\nhttp://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/newsroom/limitations-and-uses-safety-measurement-system-data-assessing-motor-carrier-safety .\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fmcsa-releases-additional-analysis-on-alternatives-for-safety-measurement-system-300156780.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
