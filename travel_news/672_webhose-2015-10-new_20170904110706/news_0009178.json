An exhibit of Australian indigenous art is being displayed at a Quebec City museum \"Lifelines: Indigenous Contemporary Art From Australia\" opened Wednesday at Quebec City's Musee de la civilisation, which called it the first major Canadian exhibition of its kind. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO \n\"For me, these works are anchors, footprints and stories through which we catch a glimpse of other ways of grasping the world,\" Dussart said.\nDisplayed in an open space meant to evoke the vastness of Australia, the pieces express relationships with the earth, ancestors and the world in general, Dussart said. They are grouped in three thematic zones: Lands of Dreams, Lands of Knowledge and Lands of Power.\nA core objective of the museum is \"building bridges between cultures,\" said executive director Stephan La Roche.\n\"When we consider these works and what they tell us, it is hard not to see a parallel between the aspirations and questions of identity faced by First Peoples in Australia and those of aboriginal nations in Quebec,\" La Roche said.\nThe museum produced \"Lifelines\" in collaboration with the University of Virginia's Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection, which supplied more than half of the works. The show will run until September 2016.\n———\nOnline: https://www.mcq.org/en\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:24:10.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
