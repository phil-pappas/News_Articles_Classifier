New-car prices have increased by $660 (up 2 percent) from September 2014 , while climbing $167 (up 0.5 percent) from last month.\n\"Transaction prices continue to rise, with month-over-month increases spurred primarily by luxury utility vehicles, while year-over-year numbers are driven by strength in trucks, vans, crossovers and full-size cars,\" said Akshay Anand , analyst for Kelley Blue Book. \"At the manufacturer level, nearly all automakers beat the year-over-year industry average, with the exception of Toyota Motor Company and Volkswagen Group . The recent Volkswagen crisis undoubtedly has impacted pricing, and likely will impact sales. The automaker has a rough road ahead, not only through 2015 but into 2016 as well.\"\nManufacturer\nSeptember\n2015 Transaction Price (Avg.)*\nAugust\n2015 Transaction Price (Avg.)*\nSeptember 2014 Transaction Price (Avg.)*\nPercent Change August\n2015 to September\n2015*\nPercent Change September\n2014 to September\n2015*\nAmerican Honda (Acura, Honda)\n$27,298\n$27,082\n$26,738\n0.8%\n2.1%\nFiat Chrysler (Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, RAM)\n$34,809\n$34,790\n$33,429\n0.1%\n4.1%\nFord Motor Company (Ford, Lincoln)\n$36,803\n$36,697\n$35,466\n0.3%\n3.8%\nGeneral Motors (Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC)\n$38,656\n$38,479\n$37,278\n0.5%\n3.7%\nHyundai-Kia\n$25,303\n$25,188\n$24,531\n0.5%\n3.1%\nNissan North America (Nissan, Infiniti)\n$28,033\n$28,012\n$27,230\n0.1%\n2.9%\nToyota Motor Company (Lexus, Scion, Toyota)\n$30,733\n$30,615\n$30,539\n0.4%\n0.6%\nVolkswagen Group (Audi, Volkswagen, Porsche)\n$39,008\n$39,647\n$39,045\n-1.6%\n-0.1%\nIndustry\n$33,730\n$33,563\n$33,070\n0.5%\n2.0%\n*Kelley Blue Book Average Transaction Prices do not include applied consumer incentives\nSeptember's biggest winners year-over-year are Dodge , Fiat , GMC , Mazda and Volvo , all reporting transaction growth well above 5 percent. Dodge average transaction price strength is fueled by its Challenger and Charger, as the Hellcat trim levels continue to climb in popularity. GMC growth is due to the Sierra, which should continue to help the brand as the refreshed 2016 model debuted this week. Mazda pricing is up across the board. In fact, every vehicle within Mazda's lineup is up from this time last year. This is a great sign for the brand, as profitability keeps increasing along with stellar sales growth.\n\"Volvo's XC90 transaction prices have jumped an astonishing 41 percent year-over-year, which is by far the best mark for any vehicle, regardless of brand,\" said Anand. \"Considering the industry average in that same span is at 2 percent, this stellar reception for the redesigned XC90 is a great sign for Volvo's brand turnaround.\"\nSegment\nSeptember 2015 Transaction Price (Avg.)*\nAugust 2015 Transaction Price (Avg.)*\nSeptember 2014 Transaction Price (Avg.)*\nPercent Change August 2015 to September 2015*\nPercent Change September 2014 to September 2015*\nCompact Car\n$20,469\n$20,353\n$20,373\n0.6%\n0.5%\nCompact SUV/Crossover\n$27,316\n$27,123\n$26,650\n0.7%\n2.5%\nElectric Vehicle\n$35,269\n$35,233\n$36,028\n0.1%\n-2.1%\nEntry-level Luxury Car\n$39,626\n$39,664\n$40,033\n-0.1%\n-1.0%\nFull-size Car\n$34,394\n$34,312\n$33,070\n0.2%\n4.0%\nFull-size Pickup Truck\n$46,046\n$45,963\n$43,356\n0.2%\n6.2%\nFull-Size SUV/Crossover\n$46,809\n$46,398\n$45,706\n0.9%\n2.4%\nHigh Performance Car\n$91,614\n$91,370\n$91,946\n0.3%\n-0.4%\nHigh-end Luxury Car\n$91,551\n$92,870\n$91,694\n-1.4%\n-0.2%\nHybrid/Alternative Energy Car\n$25,462\n$25,369\n$25,748\n0.4%\n-1.1%\nLuxury Car\n$55,248\n$55,370\n$55,566\n-0.2%\n-0.6%\nLuxury Compact SUV/Crossover\n$42,087\n$42,050\n$41,784\n0.1%\n0.7%\nLuxury Full-size SUV/Crossover\n$66,555\n$65,838\n$67,208\n1.1%\n-1.0%\nLuxury Mid-size SUV/Crossover\n$52,288\n$51,302\n$54,332\n1.9%\n-3.8%\nMid-size Car\n$25,181\n$25,136\n$24,949\n0.2%\n0.9%\nMid-size Pickup Truck\n$29,630\n$29,599\n$28,531\n0.1%\n3.9%\nMid-size SUV/Crossover\n$34,145\n$34,104\n$33,157\n0.1%\n3.0%\nMinivan/Van\n$33,150\n$33,263\n$31,645\n-0.3%\n4.8%\nSports Car\n$31,226\n$31,405\n$31,512\n-0.6%\n-0.9%\nSubcompact Car\n$17,922\n$18,041\n$17,636\n-0.7%\n1.6%\nIndustry\n$33,730\n$33,563\n$33,070\n0.5%\n2.0%\n*Kelley Blue Book Average Transaction Prices do not include applied consumer incentives\nTo discuss this topic, or any other automotive-related information, with a Kelley Blue Book analyst on-camera via the company's on-site studio, please contact a member of the Public Relations team to book an interview.\nFor more information and news from Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com, visit www.kbb.com/media/ , follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/kelleybluebook (or @kelleybluebook), like our page on Facebook at www.facebook.com/kbb , and get updates on Google+ at https://plus.google.com/+kbb .\nAbout Kelley Blue Book ( www.kbb.com )\nFounded in 1926, Kelley Blue Book, The Trusted Resource® , is the only vehicle valuation and information source trusted and relied upon by both consumers and the automotive industry.
