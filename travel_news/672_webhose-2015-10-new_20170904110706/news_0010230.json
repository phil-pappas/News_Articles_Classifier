Geoffrey Thomas, editor in chief of the Australia-based website, says he wasn't surprised to see which airlines made his company's top 10 lists.\n\"These airlines are consistently a byword for inflight excellence and service,\" he says. \"They are the trendsetters and the industry looks to what they are doing next.\"\nThomas says the lack of U.S. airlines on the list is unsurprising.\n\"The AirlineRatings.com top 10 also recognizes the lead that airlines take in introducing new products for passengers. The last cabin innovation from an American airline was the introduction of economy class by Pan American across the Atlantic in 1952.\n\"Since the 1970s American airlines have been late adopters of cabin innovations for passengers.\"\nHere are the AirlineRatings winners in alphabetical order (read the full reviews in the above gallery):\nFirst Class:\nAll Nippon Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss and Thai International\nBusiness Class:\nAir France, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Etihad Airways, Japan Airlines, Qatar, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Australia/Atlantic\nPremium Economy:\nAir France, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, EVA Air, Japan Airlines, Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic/Virgin Australia\nLong Haul Economy Class:\nAir New Zealand, Cathay Pacific Airways, Etihad, EVA Air, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways", "external_links": ["http://www.airlineratings.com/news/577/which-airlines-offer-the-best-in-first-business-premium-economy-and-economy-class-travel"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:15:13.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
