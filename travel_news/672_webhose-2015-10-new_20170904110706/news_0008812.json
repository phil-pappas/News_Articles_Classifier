Tickets are already available at prices starting from £26.55.\nFrancois Bourienne, Commercial Director at Glasgow Airport said: “This new Bucharest service from Blue Air is sure to be popular with both our business and leisure customers. As well as offering a key transport link to one of Eastern Europe’s central cities, this twice weekly service will also be a great link for ex-pats and those seeking a historical and cultured city break. We are looking forward to working with Blue Air to ensure the success of this service at Glasgow Airport.”\nBlue Air General Manager, Gheorghe RACARU said: “Since its first flight more than 10 years ago, Blue Air has been consistently developing with new routes, fleet increases and new services that offer passengers an extremely pleasant experience on board our aircraft. It is my pleasure to announce the new Glasgow to Bucharest service.”\nThe announcement brings the total number of new routes launched from Glasgow Airport in 2015 to 23.
