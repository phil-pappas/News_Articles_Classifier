The event, on Friday, December 11, will be the first show as part of the Ricoh Arena’s music series, ‘An Evening With…’, where 500 guests will be treated to a unique fine dining experience with specially selected premium wines to complement the evening menu followed by a show with a legendary act. \nThe ‘An Evening With …’ series is the first announcement in a programme which will see the comprehensive venue establish a programme of music from intimate performances through to standing indoor concerts and stadium bowl shows. Andy Gibb, Ricoh Arena’s Managing Director, said: “World-class music has always and will continue to play a key part of the Ricoh Arena experience as we look to engage music fans of all ages and tastes. “An Evening With...’ will be a special evening for guests to attend on a regular basis and we are delighted that Marianne Faithfull is launching the series. We will be announcing more dates, acts and events in the near future. “The venue was created with music and entertainment – as well as sport and business – very much in mind and it has undoubtedly proved its pedigree by hosting the likes of Take That, Bruce Springsteen and Coldplay. “The versatile nature of the venue means we are suited to a wide range of concerts both in size and genre. That is something we are very keen to build on and our plans are progressing very positively.” The 50th anniversary of the beginning of Faithfull’s recording career was marked in 2014 – five decades on from a fateful 1964 party in London where she was spotted, at the age of 17, by The Rolling Stones’ manager Andrew Loog Oldham. Just three months after the party, Faithfull found herself in the limelight as a top ten pop star with her evocative take on Jagger/Richards’ ‘As Tears Go By’. She has gone on to enjoy an eventful life and has produced a wide and varied catalogue of albums, and a string of favourites will be performed at the Ricoh Arena on December 11.
