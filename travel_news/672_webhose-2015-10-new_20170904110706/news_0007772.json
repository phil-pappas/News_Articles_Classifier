Even thousands in some cases.\nMy comprehensive car insurance renewal policy is about to come due and with a bit of research I saved myself a nice little sum of $144 for jumping insurers for the third year running.\nI’m an insurer’s worst nightmare because I always get the itch to switch to score a better deal.\nBut really there will be a lot of customers who won’t be bothered to do this and will end up paying more than they need to.\nExpert advice ... personal finance writer Sophie Elsworth explains how to save money when paying for insurance Source: News Corp Australia\nMy car — a modest four-door sedan — was going to cost me an extra $144 to insure if I sat on my tail and stuck with the same insurer. But will a few clicks on online financial comparison websites and a couple of phone calls I scored myself a much better deal within minutes.\nNot only did I score myself a lower policy premium, I also high-fived myself for nabbing a lower excess if I did have a crash.\nIt dropped from $700 to $600 and I also scored myself a much better “agreed value” if I do end up in a bingle.\nAnd this agreed value — an amount agreed between you and the insurer — was no amount to be sneezed at it — it was a hefty $3900 difference.\nThe problem we face with insurers in Australia is that there is two companies — Insurance Australia Group and Suncorp that command about 40 per cent of the nation’s insurance brands.\nIAG owns brands such as NRMA, RACV and CGU and Suncorp owns brand names including AAMI, GIO and APIA.\nWhen I phoned up my current insurer to make sure my current policy wasn’t automatically renewing once it expired, they were only too eager to keep my business when I told them I thought my renewal costs were too high and I was going to jump ship.\nWithin less than a minute they changed the drivers allowed to drive my car from over 25 to over 30 and this saved me $88 on the spot.\nI still said the policy was still too high so they then dropped it another $17.\nThere was a $100 saving just by asking for a better deal.\nBut it still wasn’t enough to make me continue my business with them.\nInsurers often catch customers out through hefty excesses and lower values of whatever is insured. Wrecked ... You don’t want to find yourself with high excess Source: News Limited\nWhen I was about to wave goodbye to my insurer on the phone, they conversation wasn’t to be over just yet.\nThe helpful assistant then decided to hit me up for a measly sum of $1.84 that apparently I owed them and she wasn’t sure what for.\nShe said she was going to find out and she’d phone me back.\nI was only too happy for them to chase for me $1.84.\nWhat a waste of everybody’s time — they had just lost me as a customer and now they wanted another few bucks off me before I signed off.\nSo it just goes to show it pays to shop around — you can be ripped off by failing to do your homework and simply paying your latest renewal notice.\nsophie.elsworth@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Insuring you get the best deal", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/insuring-you-get-the-best-deal/story-e6frfm1i-1227555554293", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/03/1227555/554265-17e646b4-67d6-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/03/1227555/554725-f5773fcc-67e2-11e5-91d3-28f7a697e8f4.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:12:15.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
