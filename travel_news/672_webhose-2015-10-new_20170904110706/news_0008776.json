Last updated 05:00, October 11 2015 SUPPLIED \nLike many Kiwis, Hana Garrett-Walker uses London as a home base for exploring Europe. \nYou know you've become a Londoner when you've perfected the art of the death stare on the Tube, says Hana Garrett-Walker. \nWhat inspired your move, and how long have you been there? Three years ago my boyfriend and I were sitting in an Auckland restaurant waiting to meet friends when we started talking about life plans, one month later we were on a plane to Southeast Asia. London was never necessarily the end goal, it just ended up happening that way. Some days I say we were looking for adventure, others I say we were simply escaping. \nWhat do you do there? I work as a teaching assistant at a primary school in North London. I chose it for the 13 weeks of school holidays a year but ended up loving it. What are the greatest advantages to living there? The world is on your doorstep. Both within London – it's a whole world within the M25 – and beyond. It becomes addictive finding the best deals. One week we visited Amsterdam, Bruges and Brussels for $70 each. Kiwi expats: What's your tale? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nDisadvantages? The underground. Anyone who has lived in or visited London will understand. Gone are any friendly smiles, or that famous British politeness. In fact, you aren't a Londoner until you have perfected the death stare. Sometimes I have to remind myself where I came from when I too glare at someone who has dared to stand in front of the doors while waiting for the train. \nHow expensive is it compared to New Zealand? How much is a beer? Living costs are through the roof. We pay $1400 a month to live in a shared flat with two others, and have no lounge (that's cheap compared to most of my friends). But then supermarket shopping is cheaper than New Zealand; a pint costs about $8, on a good day. Though you can pick up a beer at the supermarket for $2 and drink it in the park. \nIt may be one of the easiest ways to get around London, but the underground is notoriously unfriendly.

They were the best investment we made, it opened up a whole new London to me – one which didn't involve having my soul, and money, sucked away by the underground. And then there's that big giant continent known as Europe right on your doorstep. That takes up a fair bit of my spare time. \nWhat's the local delicacy and would you recommend eating it? London has every cuisine under the sun. My favourite is a stretch of restaurants in Hoxton which all specialise in Vietnamese food. Cheap and delicious. \nEasiest way to get around? As soon as you walk out your door there's an abundance of public transport. If I have to wait for more than three minutes for a bus, train or tube I turn into a very angry and impatient traveller. Buses are the cheapest way to get around, but not necessarily the quickest. \nWhat's the shopping like? Being in one of the most metropolitan cities in the world means there is every shopping scenario available. My favourite, though, is cheap and simple – the local op-shops. They are incredible and have an unbelievable selection of near-new books.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:32:48.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
