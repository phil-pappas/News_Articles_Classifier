In recent years, she has concentrated on architectural abstracts and the elegant reinterpretation of foliage and trees. Ver’s style is characterised by using large swathes of brushstrokes and colour experimentation.\nJumeirah Creekside Hotel is also home to a specially commissioned art collection which helps to connect the property to the region’s vibrant art and cultural heritage. A selection of Middle Eastern contemporary art is playfully arranged throughout the hotel, enabling guests to discover different sculptures and paintings through a series of chance encounters. Comprising 482 works by 51 contemporary artists, the exhibition also includes videos, limited edition series and mixed media works.\nSource:- Jumeirah", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:55:24.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
