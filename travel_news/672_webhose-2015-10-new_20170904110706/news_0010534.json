A limited number of stations will also be served by replacement bus services.\nThe evening alterations will be suspended over the Christmas period – from December 11 to January 2 – and full details of the changes can be found at www.scotrail.co.uk or by downloading the ScotRail journey checker app.\nRodger Querns, EGIP programme director, said: “The Edinburgh Glasgow Improvement Programme is a massive investment in Scotland’s railway that will help deliver long lasting benefits for both individual passengers and the wider economy.“Electrifying the line between our two biggest cities will allow us to run faster, longer, greener trains and cut journey times while increasing the number of seats available.\n“All the information that passengers will need to plan their journey during these improvement works is available on the ScotRail website and from National Rail Enquiries.”\nSource:-Network Rai", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:11:40.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
