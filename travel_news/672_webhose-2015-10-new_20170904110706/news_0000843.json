This city of temples and ancient Buddhist walkways is where, as writer Stephen Drucker said, \"You can still feel the heartbeat of old China....\" Whether you're devout or just inquisitive, here are half a dozen steps to finding Zento purify your spirit or to simplify your life while experiencing those rare states -- peace and quiet. - Trod the Yunqi Bamboo-Lined Path, an ancient Buddhist walkway winding through a centuries-old bamboo forest. It's so quiet you can commune with the trees -- you may even hear them growing - bamboo can spurt up 35 inches in a 24 hour period. - Listen to Buddha. The sonorous sound of the evening bells ringing from the jewel-like Jingci Temple at the foot of Nanping Hill permeates the city, its calming effect suitable for meditation. Or go to Hangzhou's Buddhist Institute to relax and chill out while with the reverent chanting of the monks. - Visit the Lingyin Temple. Commonly known as the Temple of the Soul's retreat, it is one of the largest temples in China and comprised of numerous pagodas, Buddhist grottoes and religious rock carvings, the most famous of which is Flying Peak Afar. This is a go-to temple for pilgrims as well as tourists. - Spend time in Hangzhou's Botanical Gardens.Contemplate the lotus in all seasons; the hammock forest in summer; the Yulan trees in spring, the sweet-scented-osmanthus in autumn and the pines and bamboo in winter. But what really draws the gaze is Lingfeng Hill - more than 5,000 plum trees standing upright in a roseate blaze. And in winter when snowflakes fall silently onto the plum blossoms, creating a lacy tree tunnel, what could be a better place for meditation? - Take Zen tea. Jingshan Mountain in the Yuhang district is the place where the Classic Book of Tea - the first ever book on how to cultivate, make and drink tea -- was written. Every May they celebrate with the China Chasheng (Sage of Tea) Festival. Another area, Longjing, produces the most renowned Dragon Well Tea in the world. In the tranquil Imperial Tea Garden at the foot of a terraced hill you can enjoy dishes made with Longjing tea leaves. - Stay at the Amanfayun Hotel. Hidden in a valley to the west of Hangzhou's mystical West Lake, the hotel is adjacent to Lingyin andYongfu Temples, so you will have monks for neighbors. This luxury boutique resort is comprised of 47 stone courtyard dwellings designed in the spirit of a traditional Chinese village, a few of which are more than 100 years old. Surrounded by 35 acres of tea fields, it is a last resort of peace and quiet.Become a Hangzhou Travel Expert and Enjoy a FREE Hangzhou Holiday! Do you know Hangzhou?
