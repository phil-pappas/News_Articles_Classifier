In addition to this, teams supported by TeXtreme ® obtained several podium places.\n(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151026/771747 )\nVideo:\nhttp://www.textreme.com/b2b/news-room/cars-using-textreme-successful-in-solar-race\nThe teams are using TeXtreme ® Spread Tow carbon reinforcements to reduce weight, improve stiffness and impact tolerance. They participated in different classes in the 2015 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge held 18 th to 25 th of October in the Australian outback.\nNuon Solar Team early took the lead in the prestigious Challenger Class and then never looked back, holding the number one position all the way to the finish. The total weight of their car, Nuna8, was 150kg and by that the lightest car in the whole competition. The total amount of the composite parts of the car, using TeXtreme ® developed in cooperation with DSM, weighs in total 41kg, which is a reduction with 10kg from its predecessor.\nIn the Cruiser Class there where two solar cars on the podium reinforced by TeXtreme ® . Looking at the whole result list there were a large number of teams participating using this unique carbon fiber fabrics and benefitting from the knowledge of the TeXtreme ® team in choosing the right reinforcements.\n\"In overall all the teams and students have been very good at utilizing the unique benefits of TeXtreme ® Spread Tow carbon reinforcements and designing the composite parts balancing the mechanical properties and weight savings to get the optimal results on the car and in the race. We are proud to have supported all these teams and been fortunate to work with so many talented young engineers - they do a fantastic work\", says Henrik Blycker , CEO of Oxeon AB.\nThe prominent positions by the supported teams further establish TeXtreme ® as the leading composite reinforcement material when it comes to making lightweight products.\nAlongside the use of TeXtreme ® in Solar cars, other users can be found in Formula 1, America's Cup, NASCAR, Le Mans, Indy Car , bicycles, ice hockey, golf, tennis, surf boards, table tennis, rowing shells, canoes, skis, snowboards, as well as various industrial and advanced aerospace applications.\nAbout World Solar Challenge\nThe World Solar Challenge is a solar-powered car race which covers 3021 km (1,877 miles) through the Australian Outback, from Darwin to Adelaide . The race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools. The race has a 20-year history spanning eleven races, with the inaugural event taking place in 1987. The objective of this competition is to promote research on solar-powered cars.\nAbout TeXtreme ®\nTeXtreme ® Spread Tow reinforcements is the ultimate choice for making ultra-light composites. TeXtreme ® Technology is flexible and tow-size independent which enables development of optimized reinforcement solutions tailor-made for specific application needs. Utilization of TeXtreme ® Spread Tow carbon fabrics and carbon UD tapes by manufacturers of advanced aerospace, industrial and sports products confirms that 20-30% lighter composite parts can be produced with improved mechanical properties and superior surface smoothness.\nTeXtreme ® is a registered trademark owned by Oxeon AB. Founded in 2003, Oxeon has quickly established itself as the market leader in Spread Tow reinforcements with its products marketed under the brand name TeXtreme ® .
