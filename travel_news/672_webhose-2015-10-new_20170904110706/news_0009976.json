The event was inspired by Tobs Cohen, a golfer himself and more important a seasoned organizer of golf tours to Kenya and the region. \nKnown this year as the JW Seagon & Bupa Kenya Golf Trophy will, what has arguably become Africa’s largest corporate golfing tournament, the tournament be staged at the Muthaiga Golf Club in Nairobi. A maximum of 100 players, on a first come first serve basis, will take to the Tees that day for an entry fee of 10.000 Kenya Shillings which will allow them to bring a guest for the social function in the evening when the winners will be honoured. \nEtihad Airways is once again a key sponsor of the competition and has provided four tickets, two in business class to any of their global destinations for the winner and two in economy class to any destination in their network for the runner-up, showing their ongoing commitment to the sport of golf in Kenya, one of Africa’s leading golf destinations. Among other key sponsors is also the Kenya Tourism Board, which has been working hard to penetrate the fast growing global golf holiday market to bring people from around the world to Kenya to play the game. \nNairobi County, unbeknown to many, in fact offers 14 golf courses within the country boundaries and yet more beyond. Championship courses like Muthaiga, Windsor and Karen are supplemented by the Railway Golf Club, Royal Nairobi and many others, while at the Kenya coast another three top notch courses are available for play. These are the already famous Vipingo Ridge, the Leisure Lodge Golf Club in Diani and the Nyali Golf and Country Club on the northern mainland of Mombasa. Yet more courses, often dubbed as ‘safari golf’, are found at such places like the Aberdare Country Club near Nyeri or the Mt. Kenya Safari Club near Nanyuki but generally across the country where most towns have their own course and golf club. \nKenya Airways but also RwandAir connect the entire Eastern African region to Nairobi, and Mombasa for that matter, for aficionados who wish to see the event play out live or else feel inspired to visit Kenya for a golfing vacation second to none.
