Unfavorable foreign currency translation and the divestiture of operations in Venezuela were the primary drivers of the comparison, lowering sales by $136 million and $22 million , respectively. Adjusting for these factors, Dana's Light Vehicle Driveline Technologies, Off-Highway Driveline Technologies, and Power Technologies business units posted combined organic sales growth of $69 million , or 6 percent higher than a year ago, driven by higher light-vehicle end-market demand and new business gains. Commercial Vehicle Driveline sales in the quarter, adjusted for the effects of foreign currency, were lower by $80 million , or about 16 percent, when compared with the same period a year ago. Significant weakness in South American truck production and lower market share with a North American customer as a result of supply constraints the company encountered during the first half of the year – which have since been remedied – were the principal drivers of lower sales in the quarter.\nNet income for the quarter was $119 million , compared with $90 million in the same period in 2014. The company's 2015 results included a $100 million tax benefit from the release of certain U.S. deferred tax valuation allowances related to planned changes in the company's legal operating structure. Net income also included a $24 million after-tax impairment charge for certain assets in the company's Commercial Vehicle Driveline business related to a distressed supplier in Brazil. These non-cash items are excluded from Dana's adjusted EBITDA and diluted adjusted earnings per share. Adjusting for these items, net income for the quarter was lower than last year by $47 million , principally reflecting lower adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $167 million , compared with $198 million for the same period in 2014, while adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales was 11.4 percent, compared with 12.1 percent last year. In the third quarter of 2014, Dana's Venezuela operations, which were divested in early 2015, generated adjusted EBITDA of $6 million on sales of $22 million , largely reflecting the timing of recoveries due to currency devaluation. Foreign currency lowered adjusted EBITDA by $24 million in this year's third quarter, while the impact of lower commercial-vehicle sales more than offset the benefits of higher volume and new business across the company's other business units. On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales increased by 20 basis points compared with the second quarter of this year.\nDiluted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.41 , compared with $0.57 in the third quarter of 2014. Lower earnings in the quarter were partially offset by the benefit of a reduced share count from the continued execution of the company's share-repurchase program.\nFree cash flow was $68 million in the quarter, compared with $61 million in the same period last year, reflecting lower working capital requirements partially offset by lower operating earnings, timing of interest payments, and higher capital spending to support new program launches in 2016.\n\"The majority of our businesses continued to execute well, as three of our four business units achieved a combined 6 percent increase in organic growth, compared with last year, reflecting the benefit of new business and increased volumes,\" said recently appointed President and Chief Executive Officer James Kamsickas . \"Compared to 2014, Brazil truck production reduced by 49 percent and North America sales reduced as a result of market share shifts. These sales reductions weighed heavily on the performance of our commercial-vehicle business over the past quarter. We remain focused on aligning our cost structure in South America to the continued low demand environment as well as leveraging the expected benefits from our completed supply chain initiatives, which will ultimately better serve our customers and position us for profitable growth.\"\nShare-Repurchase Program\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, Dana repurchased an additional $119 million in shares of common stock. Since the inception of Dana's $1.4 billion share-repurchase program, the company has repurchased or redeemed the equivalent of 63 million common shares, returning more than $1.334 billion to shareholders. At the end of the third quarter, $66 million of authorization remained under the current program.\nBusiness Unit Results for the Third Quarter\nLight Vehicle Driveline Technologies\nSales were $605 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared with $608 million last year. Foreign currency and the Venezuela divestiture completed earlier this year lowered sales by $29 million and $22 million , respectively. Offsetting these items were stronger light-vehicle market demand in North America and Europe , as well as new business gains that increased sales $48 million in the quarter – representing a strong organic growth rate of 8 percent compared with last year.\nSegment EBITDA for the quarter was $63 million , or 10.4 percent of sales, compared with segment EBITDA of $70 million , or 11.5 percent of sales, in the third quarter of 2014. Compared with last year, foreign currency and divestiture-related effects lowered earnings by $7 and $6 million , respectively. Increased volume in the quarter provided an earnings benefit of $9 million , which was partially offset by expected higher program launch costs in the current quarter and the favorable impact of cost recoveries that benefitted last year's results.\nCommercial Vehicle Driveline Technologies\nSales were $367 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared with $487 million last year. Foreign currency lowered sales by $40 million , principally due to weaker South American currencies. Further, significantly weaker end-market demand in South America , including a 49 percent reduction in year-over-year Brazil truck production, lowered sales by $55 million in the quarter compared with last year. Sales in North America were lower by $30 million , reflecting lower customer share. Improved performance of $5 million in the quarter provided a partial offset to these factors.\nSegment EBITDA for the third quarter of 2015 was $31 million , or 8.4 percent of sales, compared with last year's segment EBITDA of $47 million , or 9.7 percent of sales. Lower sales volume, including the impact on cost performance in South America of $11 million , was the primary driver of the comparison and more than offset the benefits of improved performance and supply-chain savings. Foreign currency further reduced segment earnings by about $5 million compared with last year.\nOff-Highway Driveline Technologies\nSales were $246 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared with $283 million last year. Foreign currency, principally a weaker euro, was the primary driver of the change, lowering sales by $37 million compared with last year. New business gains tempered the impact of continued weakness in global end-market demand.\nSegment EBITDA for the third quarter of 2015 was $35 million , or 14.2 percent of sales, compared with last year's segment EBITDA of $40 million , or 14.1 percent of sales. Favorable volume and mix as well as cost performance partially offset the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, driving a 10-basis-point improvement in margin for the quarter compared with last year.\nPower Technologies\nSales were $250 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared with $259 million last year, reflecting $30 million in foreign currency effects principally driven by a weaker euro and Canadian dollar. Organic sales growth of $21 million , or 8 percent compared with last year, reflected higher end-market demand in North America and Europe , as well as new business gains, provided a partial offset to currency impacts.\nSegment EBITDA for the third quarter of 2015 was $40 million , or 16.0 percent of sales, compared with last year's segment EBITDA of $37 million , or 14.3 percent of sales. Compared with last year, the 170-basis-point improvement in margin reflected the benefit of favorable volume, mix, and cost performance more than offsetting the effects of foreign currency.\nYear-to-Date 2015 Financial Summary – Sales and Adjusted EBITDA\nYear-to-date sales totaled $4.685 billion , $350 million lower than last year. Unfavorable foreign currency and the divestiture of operations in Venezuela more than accounted for the comparison, lowering sales by $413 million and $69 million , respectively. Organic growth provided a partial offset to these factors and increased sales by $132 million , or 3 percent, compared with last year.\nYear-to-date adjusted EBITDA totaled $523 million , $45 million lower than last year. Foreign currency effects and the divestiture of operations in Venezuela lowered adjusted EBITDA by $69 million . The benefit of increased volumes and new business as well as favorable cost performance partially offset these factors, resulting in 2015 adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales of 11.2 percent – only slightly lower than last year.\n\"We remain focused on executing our plan – profitable growth through incremental margin improvement and a continued focus on driving cost efficiencies. Despite significant currency headwinds, lower commercial-vehicle sales in North America , and weakness in certain end-markets we serve, we have held our margin performance steady this year, with three of our four business units improving their margins so far this year,\" Kamsickas said.\nAdjusting Full-Year 2015 Financial Targets on Lower Sales Expectations\nWhile commercial-vehicle supply chain challenges in North America have been resolved, the company expects lower customer share positions to persist through the remainder of this year, which, coupled with weaker end-market demand in the fourth quarter, will impact Commercial Vehicle Driveline sales. Macroeconomic factors are expected to further temper light-vehicle demand in South America and Asia , and weaker global demand for construction and agriculture equipment will lower sales for the remainder of 2015.\nTo reflect these factors, the company is lowering its full-year 2015 financial targets to:\nSales of approximately $6.05 billion ; Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $675 million ; Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of sales of approximately 11.2 percent; Diluted adjusted EPS of approximately $1.85 (excluding the impact of share repurchases after September 30, 2015 ); Capital spending of approximately $280 million ; and Free cash flow of approximately $170 million . Dana Sourced for Next-Generation Jeep Wrangler; Will Continue to Supply Drivelines for Ford Ranger\nDana was recently sourced to supply the driveline for the next-generation Jeep Wrangler. The company has supplied drivelines for the legendary Jeep Wrangler throughout its evolution – since its predecessor vehicle was first introduced in 1941.\nDana's advanced Spicer ® drivelines will continue to provide superior technology to maintain the Wrangler's renowned off-roading capabilities, while also improving efficiency.\nDana will also continue to supply the drivelines for Ford's Ranger pickup truck manufactured in Thailand , South Africa , and Argentina .\nThis Ford pickup truck, sold in 180 countries, is one of the world's most popular and recognized compact pickup trucks in the world.\nCompany to Supply Key Components for Oshkosh JLTVs to Optimize Safety, Performance\nDana was also named the nominated supplier of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTV) to be manufactured by Oshkosh Corporation for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.

Adjusted EBITDA is a primary driver of cash flows from operations and a measure of our ability to maintain and continue to invest in our operations and provide shareholder returns. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a substitute for income before income taxes, net income, or other results reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nDiluted adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we have defined as adjusted net income divided by adjusted diluted shares. We define adjusted net income as net income attributable to the parent company, excluding any nonrecurring income tax items, restructuring and impairment expense, amortization expense, and other nonrecurring items (as used in adjusted EBITDA), net of any associated income tax effects. We define adjusted diluted shares as diluted shares as determined in accordance with GAAP based on adjusted net income. This measure is considered useful for purposes of providing investors, analysts, and other interested parties with an indicator of ongoing financial performance that provides enhanced comparability to EPS reported by other companies. Diluted adjusted EPS is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative measure to diluted EPS reported under GAAP.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we have defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchases of property, plant, and equipment. We believe this measure is useful to investors in evaluating the operational cash flow of the company inclusive of the spending required to maintain the operations. Free cash flow is neither intended to represent nor be an alternative to the measure of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reported under GAAP. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe accompanying financial information provides reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA, diluted adjusted EPS, and free cash flow to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nPlease reference the \"Non-GAAP financial information\" accompanying our quarterly earnings conference call presentations on our website at www.dana.com/investors for our GAAP results and the reconciliations of these measures, where used, to the comparable GAAP measures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements and projections contained in this news release are, by their nature, forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
