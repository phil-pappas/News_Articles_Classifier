The ASAP Convention – now in its 6th successive year - is the serviced apartment sector’s must-attend event of the year. It is the one time of year where this rapidly growing industry comes together offering an invaluable opportunity to network with key players, learn about trends and gather future insights. \nThe event attracts serviced apartment operators and agents from across the UK and increasingly overseas as well as investors, suppliers and industry experts. James Tweddle, Director of Sales for Sky Business said: ‘We are delighted to be supporting this event and look forward to what will be a hugely insightful and valuable day. It is fantastic to see the Association of Serviced Apartment Providers expanding its membership and we look forward to continuing our support for the serviced apartment sector and sharing knowledge, ideas and experience with members to help shape and enhance the guest experience’. James Foice, ASAP’s Managing Director adds: ‘We are absolutely delighted to align our flagship event of the year – our 2015 ASAP Convention - with Sky. ASAP has worked very closely with Sky for the last 6 years. Their senior team have invested significant time to closely consult with our serviced apartment operator members to evolve their product offering to fully meet the needs of our sector to ensure the overall objective of enhancing the guest experience was realised. We are delighted to progress our partnership with them to a new level this year with their headline sponsorship of our flagship event.’ The one-day Convention is expected to attract a capacity attendance of 400 delegates this year and will culminate with the ASAP Industry Awards Dinner recognising and celebrating the achievements of ASAP’s members in 2015 with Sky’s James Tweddle presenting the winners with their awards.
