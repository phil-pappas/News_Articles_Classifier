PUBLISHED: 09:36, Sat, Oct 24, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:35, Sat, Oct 24, 2015 ALAMY The Bedruthan Hotel & Spa lies close to Mawgan Porth beach and is on the South West Coast Path \nThe brochure's \"more home from home than hotel\" tag is right. And nestled on the beautiful north Cornish coast in the small town of Mawgan Porth, near Newquay, we discover it's just the place for our first hotel adventure with our six-month-old, Clara. \nOur seaview family room has a cot, microwave, bottle warmer and there is a handy play mat for Clara. The hotel has two restaurants including the Wild Café where we enjoyed wholesome lunches \nAs she happily adapts to her new surroundings, mum and dad recline in cosy armchairs with a glass of wine enjoying the glorious roaring sea and shimmering sands below. \nAs well as the endless sands we also see children charing around the adventure playground and kicking a ball on the sports field. \nWe head off on a walk from the hotel which is a few steps away from the South West Coast Path. Within 10 minutes we are atop the headland overlooking the pretty town. Down to the left the Bedruthan sits on a prime position on the cliff. \nWith Clara safely strapped into a sling we make a steady ascent through rocky paths lined with heather before following the tiny path around the headland. We are soon very much at one with nature. \nThe bustle of Mawgan Porth beach is replaced by the sight of waves crashing into the rock face below. We hardly see a soul as we steadily make our way to one of the most beautiful vantage points in Cornwall, the Bedruthan Steps, named after the mythological giant Bedruthan, said to have used the beach stacks as stepping stones. Giants or not, this is an incredible view. The walk and fresh air mean we're ready for our lunch at the Carnewas National Trust centre. \nBack at the hotel Clara continues her budding swimming career in the pools. It's busy as guests enjoy the spa facilities and lounge in the sun on the veranda outside. \nAs the water baby dries off, mum heads for a massage and enjoys a two-hour ila Chakra wellbeing treatment: a full-body scrub and the ritual pouring of warm oil over the \"third eye\" to calm the mind. \nThings at the Bedruthan are going very calmly, thank you, and as mum concentrates on chillaxing, dad and baby head back to the room to get ready for dinner. PH Cornwall's Bedruthan Hotel & Spa's is calm and traditional on the outside Related articles Bonding with the very peak of Austria \nThe hotel has two restaurants including the Wild Café where we enjoyed wholesome lunches. The emphasis is on good food in a trendy, functional setting. \nBut tonight we head for the more luxurious Herring, where low lights create a much more intimate dining experience. \nAs Clara sleeps by us in her buggy, we enjoy tomato consommé with bloody Mary for starters. Then Lauren feasts on red mullet fillet with seasonal vegetables and I opt for roast Cornish duck breast with confit garlic. \nIt's simply delicious, made doubly special by the stunning Cornish beach sunset outside the window. \nTHE KNOWLEDGE The Bedruthan Hotel & Spa (01637 860860/ bedruthan.com) offers two nights from £368 (two sharing), B&B.
