The sector is forecasted to support over 280 million jobs worldwide during 2015, or one in eleven jobs on the planet.\nOver the next ten years, the sector is estimated to generate 25 million new jobs directly and support indirectly the creation of 80 million new jobs around the world.\nMost importantly, Travel and Tourism supports jobs across all levels of society. It employs a higher percentage of women (*) and young people than the whole of the economy and provides employment in rural and remote areas across the globe where job opportunities would otherwise be lacking.\nDavid Scowsill, President & CEO of the World Travel & Tourism Council, speaking on behalf of GTAC, said:\n“Our sector creates jobs at different skills levels and in areas where other employment opportunities are scarce. This is why ‘Investment in People’ is one of the four key pillars of GTAC’s Agenda for Growth and Development”.\n“In this regard, GTAC commends the G20 Tourism Ministers for placing jobs and employment high on the agenda. Travel and Tourism has a tremendous positive impact on people’s livelihoods, which enhances the community health, wealth and pride. With the extraordinary growth of our sector forecast for the next decade, we can contribute to promote more inclusive growth. Yet, doing so requires we address existing challenges, namely that of employing enough talent to meet the demand on all parts of the sector which GTAC represents.”\n“We encourage governments and private companies to play their full part in supporting the sector and implementing policies which promote proactive and careful talent management. This will help ensure that the full potential for the industry is reached, since recent research (**) shows that without this participation the sector could employ 14 million fewer people and contribute US$610 billion less in GDP to the world economy over the next ten years, when compared to accepted growth forecasts.”\n“Failure to plan properly for talent requirements leads to lower growth, reduced investment, less innovation and declining competitiveness – for both countries and companies. GTAC Members are working together in sharing research and best practices when it comes to opportunities, jobs and employment. We need the right policies, programmes and partnerships in place, to ensure that the workforce of the future knows about the opportunities in our sector, and has the appropriate skills and knowledge to support future growth.”\nSource:- PATA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:19:57.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
