Credit Andrea Wyner for The New York Times \nAdvertisement “So here’s the plan,” I told my 8-year-old son, Luke. “We’re going to different restaurants every day and eat new things every meal.” “What do they eat in Sicily ?” “A lot of fish.” “Can’t you write about something else?” I am a passionate angler and writer on the oceans, and Sicily had been for me the coveted fishy bull’s-eye at the center of the Mediterranean, a place where seafood is brought to table transformed by an ancient mélange of European and North African cookery. My son, though, has a landlubber’s palate and a tendency toward the plain. But when opportunity arose to journey to Sicily, I decided it was time to escape our child-imposed culinary straitjacket. On the advice of the cookbook author Nancy Harmon Jenkins, I chose four distinct centers of Sicilian cookery: Palermo, Trapani, Catania and the hill towns around Ragusa. Along the way my partner, Esther, and I would offer Luke tiny bribes: a soccer game in Palermo, a salt marsh with flamingos in Trapani, a hike up to Mount Etna’s caldera. But the center of it all would be seafood, and lots of it. Credit Andrea Wyner for The New York Times Palermo: Squid Ink and Soccer A little while after landing in Palermo, we took Luke to Piccolo Napoli, a no-frills trattoria fronted by a case of gleamingly fresh sea bream and cuttlefish. My eye drifted down the menu to bucatini con le sarde , a long, hollow pasta in a thick sardine sauce made green and yellow by wild fennel and saffron. Luke wouldn’t touch that one. But then I spied squid ink pasta. Back home Luke ate “black” pasta, never knowing what the boxed industrial version relied on for its color. The authentic artisan preparation arrived at Piccolo Napoli equal parts squid ink and spaghetti. “The pasta’s not even black,” Esther said, sucking an inky strand clean. “See.” Luke tried it and gagged. “Ew!” he cried, an inky ring around his lips. I took the plate. Definitely not ew. It was redolent with the salty lushness of the living ocean. But even though I enjoyed the meal I left the restaurant feeling as if I’d lost the opening round with Luke. The seafood rematch came, surprisingly, at a soccer game — Città di Palermo vs. A.C. Milan. If my passion is fish, then Luke’s is soccer, so we used a game as a sort of trade-off. Tickets were acquired through our concierge, and the next day we took our seats in a stadium flanked by dramatic rocky escarpments and surrounded by tough-looking fans clad in pink , Palermo’s team color. When a referee made a questionable call, the irate Palermitani supporters slammed empty seats and made obscene gestures at a group of visiting Milanese government officials. Amid all the shouting, a representative from the Palermo team signaled to me: “You are from America, yes? We invite you to a hospitality at the half time.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story With Palermo down 1-0 we crowded into a banquet room to find a sprawling seafood buffet. Sheets of raw marinated sole, little square glasses bristling with squid tentacles, and a whole baked salmon. At one station, a waiter spooned out what looked like a pasta ragù from an oversized tray. When I asked what it was, he confirmed it was indeed a ragù — of swordfish. I passed the plate to Luke and he ate it with gusto. “You know,” I said after he’d finished, “that was swordfish.” “No it wasn’t.” Palermo ended up losing 2-1 — but I felt that I had played to a draw. Trapani: Bluefin Revisited We headed west through the neon green Sicilian spring to Trapani. A peninsular town that marks the division between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the greater Mediterranean, Trapani was historically a migratory path for the magnificent Atlantic bluefin tuna; since Roman times fishermen have used that natural geography to funnel the giant fish into standing nets where they were trapped and harpooned to death in a bloody process called “mattanze.” Photo Trapani, historically on the migratory path of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. Credit Andrea Wyner for The New York Times It was in Trapani that I confronted my own fish-eating qualms. I have written extensively about the tragic overfishing of the bluefin. Industrial fleets have reduced the Mediterranean stock dramatically in the last half century. Some hopeful signs are emerging: Last year the World Wildlife Fund’s chief tuna scientist declared that “extraordinary efforts” have been made in recent years “which have led to the beginning of the recovery of Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin.” Even so, I was hoping to avoid eating it. That would prove difficult. At the Cantina Siciliana, a blue-tiled gem on a sleepy street run by the lifelong fisherman Pino Maggiore, a mixed seafood antipasto appeared, consisting of marinated sardines, delicate raw pink shrimp and bluefin — a carpaccio from its loin and a bottarga from its ovaries. Later we were to come across entire bluefin delicatessens in Trapani that sold everything from the great tuna’s salted heart to its dried stomach for soup stock. But the shadow of the fish’s plight hovered over this seeming bounty. Much more welcome was a juicy mackerel baked in lemon and a seafood couscous, a nutty, granulated North African-influenced creation. Also appreciated was a hearty portion of busiate, a long local noodle curled in on itself, served with Trapani’s signature garlic, tomato and almond pesto. Luke found the busiate shape intriguing but preferred it with marinara. Luke also enjoyed our other memorable taste of Trapani: the salt that had helped make the town a fish-processing hub for centuries. Through the introductions of the New York Italian specialty foods importer Gustiamo, we were able to make the acquaintance of Salvatore Gucciardo, the eldest son of a multigenerational salt-making clan. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Luke quickly befriended Mr. Gucciardo’s 5-year-old nephew, who had joined us, and together they ran through shimmering wetlands, green with shoots of garlic, flanked on one side by the cliffs of the hill town of Erice and the pulsing blue sea on the other. Flamingos were just arriving from Africa as the warmth of spring started to penetrate the island’s bones. The salt the Gucciardos harvest comes in several grades, which we sampled right from the drying piles. So bright and intense was this stuff that I later found that I could use a fraction of the salt in my home recipes so long as I used “sale Trapanese.” But like any good Sicilian, the salt merchant couldn’t leave us with just salt. It was Pasquetta, after all — the “little Easter” that Sicilians tack on after the Resurrection. First we stopped at the Bar Caffé Castelli in the village of Nubia for a snack of panelle, little triangles of deep-fried chickpeas, and a sandwich of anchovies, herbs, oil and tomatoes. Then, back at the Gucciardo home, a proper Pasquetta meal: perfectly grilled whole sardines, more busiate and a cassata cake that traces its origins to Spanish conquerors. Luke tried a bit of everything and then asked if the robed saint in the icon on the wall was Obi-Wan Kenobi. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Catania and Ragusa: A Market, a Chef and Natural Beauty We made the long haul from Trapani to Catania under cover of night and gave Luke a brief seafood respite the next day by taking him up volcanic Mount Etna and making our midday meal from rice balls filled with a magma of delicious ragù. But it was back to fish the following morning when I sneaked out at dawn toward the Pescheria, Catania’s storied fish market. I met up with Ciccio Sultano, a two-star Michelin chef and proprietor of Ristorante Duomo in Ragusa. Like a shark, Mr. Sultano circled a particularly nice loin of swordfish, as mongers cried “Ciccio! Ciccio!” With each circle, he checked to see if the price might go down. (The high price wasn’t surprising — as I was to learn later, Mediterranean swordfish, like bluefin, is a fish of concern , and conservationists are calling for tighter regulations.) In between he bought 12 cups of sea urchin, a 10-pound dentex (a kind of supersized porgy), and three flats of pink shrimp. Wedging his thumb under a shrimp’s head, he extracted a thimbleful of topaz blue eggs. “Caviar!” he said. On the fourth circle he abandoned the overpriced swordfish monger and found another equally nice loin at the price he wanted. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Sultano then took me over to his secret corner of the market where a street vendor named Carlo plunged a harpoon of a fork into a tremendous caldron and pulled out a pile of steaming offal. “Nowadays,” Mr. Sultano said, slicing it up, “everyone talks about street food. This is street food.” He handed me a quivering piece of guts and then typed a phrase into Google Translate on his phone. “Fourth stomach of the calf,” he read from the screen. I tried it, cringed and felt Luke’s pain. I left Mr. Sultano and the market with a promise to dine at Duomo in Ragusa that evening. Knowing that the chef was planning a full-on Sicilian culinary assault, we decided to get some exercise. An hour outside of Catania we came to the Pantalica, a Unesco recognized wilderness necropolis dating back to Greek and Roman times that descends through a gorgeous rocky ravine resplendent in wildflowers.

Credit Andrea Wyner for The New York Times Soon we were working up a sweat even though the Italians we passed were bundled up as if it were the dead of winter. Then a German tourist walked by in a Speedo and plunged into the steely blue Anapo River at the gorge’s bottom. Throughout, Luke snacked on another Mount Etna rice ball, savoring it to make sure it lasted the length of the trail. Hike complete, we pushed on to Ragusa. I was eager to get to the famed hill town not only to try Mr. Sultano’s food, but also because the chef had forgotten the pink shrimp with the blue eggs back at the market and had asked me to bring them. With the ice melting in the shrimp bag I gripped the rental car wheel, white-knuckled. Finally on a street about five inches wider than my car, I passed the shrimp through the car-door window to the maitre d’. Later we returned to Duomo for a Sicilian blowout, amusingly reinterpreted by Mr. Sultano. Here was a cannolo similar to ones we’d eaten everywhere, but this time stuffed with savory ricotta and presented with a prawn resting on its back. Here was the spaghetti with sea urchin we had eaten elsewhere — but now with the direction “Don’t mix.” It surprised me with layered flavors of increasing lemony-ness as I journeyed to its bottom. Here was the mackerel I’d had seared and baked but this time raw and pungent. All of these I loved. All of these I wanted Luke to love, or at least to try. But by this point my son was fished out. He had tasted so much of Sicily. The squid ink and the artisanal salt. The sardines and the anchovies. It was time at last for him to return to his comfort zone. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:39:11.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
