Contributed \nA young elephant greets Esme during her travels to Kenya. \nPOSITIVITY, passion, persistence. \nYeppoon Real Estate's Esme Coren said these three words were used together in all areas of life, but were very true in real estate, whether the real estate consultant, the seller, buyer, landlord or tenant. \nRecently returning from a tour of Kenya, Esme visited three game parks - Amboseli, Samburu and Masai Mara - but it was with the local Kenyan people, the villagers where Esme saw the most of the Ps, which she said reflected her own true work values in real estate. \n\"I watched a man cycling on a direct road with four bags of charcoal, taking it to the nearest town to sell,\" Esme said. \n\"Or in the richer fertile land of the Rift Valley area was a local riding a motorbike laden with wares, or men in a cart pulled by donkeys going about their business, showing true passion and persistence to earn a living and make a positive effect on their lives and family.\" \nEducation in Kenya in 2015 is compulsory for primary school children and the enrolment rates are roughly evenly divided between boys and girls. \nBut in secondary school, only a small number of girls obtained secondary level of education presently, partly due to cultural attitudes, traditional preferences for sons, early marriage and early pregnancies, Esme said. \n\"We saw a large number of schools in towns during our visit, mainly of every religion and missionary doing their part in educating all the children of Africa,\" she said. \nEven the young girls in the Maasai tribe village attend school, which was very heartening to Esme as a mother. \n\"Maasai women and girls in a tribal village maintain their ethnic identity and traditional lifestyle,\" Esme said. \"The life of the Maasai continues to be inextricably bound with that of their large herds of cattle.\" \nEsme and others brought from Australia small fun gifts for the children to one of the Maasi villages, which they loved. As Esme flew into the dirt airstrip at Amboseli, her first game park, she could see zebras, giraffes and wildebeest near the airstrip before the small aircraft landed close to the snow-capped Mount Kilimanjaro. \nThis was the start of experiencing the kaleidoscope of countryside colours, thousands of animals and the migration. \nElephants, hippos, buffaloes, antelopes, zebras, wildebeest, giraffes, ostriches, lions, pink flamingos, leopards and much more roamed the land. \nTelephone Esme at Yeppoon Real Estate to discuss making your real estate dreams come true or about her Kenya experience. animals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:14:14.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
