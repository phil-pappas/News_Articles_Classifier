We expect that strong performance to continue in the December quarter with operating margins of 16 to 18% and over 40% earnings per share growth,\" said Richard Anderson , Delta's chief executive officer. \"It's an honor to recognize the hard work of 80,000 outstanding Delta employees with over $1 billion of profit sharing accrued so far this year. Our team consistently delivers best-in-class operations and service to our customers, develops innovative solutions with our global partners, and produces strong returns for our shareholders.\"\nRevenue Environment\nDelta's operating revenue for the September quarter decreased 0.6%, or $71 million , including $235 million in foreign currency pressures. Passenger unit revenues declined 4.9%, which includes approximately 2.5 points of impact from foreign currency.\nDelta continues to successfully implement its Branded Fares initiative, increasing paid first class load factor by 8 points to 56% and expanding its Basic Economy product to over 450 markets. In total, Branded Fares products produced more than $75 million in incremental revenue in the September quarter.\n\"Our commercial initiatives are delivering solid benefits as we've expanded our revenue premium to the industry, strengthened our hubs in New York , Seattle and Los Angeles , and deepened our partnerships around the globe. However, low fuel prices and foreign currency have pressured our revenue performance,\" said Ed Bastian , Delta's president. \"By keeping our system capacity flat for the December quarter, we are taking action to drive improvement in our unit revenues which we forecast will decline 2.5-4.5% for the quarter including 2 points of impact from foreign currency. Our conservative growth in this low fuel environment is evidence of our commitment to getting RASM back on a positive trajectory, which is a key component to achieving our long-term margin targets.\"\nBastian continued, \"As we look ahead, fuel prices remain volatile and we are not recasting the business for low fuel prices. Our plan is for 2016 capacity growth of 0-2%, which we believe is the appropriate level to balance supply and demand and to ensure the momentum in our business continues.\"\nIncrease (Decrease)\n3Q15 versus 3Q14\nChange\nUnit\nPassenger Revenue\n3Q15 ($M)\nYoY\nRevenue\nYield\nCapacity\nMainline\n4,774\n3.8 %\n(2.3) %\n(2.5) %\n6.3 %\nRegional\n1,536\n(5.9) %\n(2.3) %\n(4.3) %\n(3.7) %\nTotal Domestic\n6,310\n1.3 %\n(3.0) %\n(3.6) %\n4.4 %\nAtlantic\n1,816\n(5.6) %\n(9.5) %\n(7.8) %\n4.3 %\nPacific\n887\n(12.7) %\n(9.3) %\n(13.1) %\n(3.7) %\nLatin America\n582\n(3.8) %\n(5.3) %\n(6.3) %\n1.6 %\nTotal Passenger\n9,595\n(1.9) %\n(4.9) %\n(5.4) %\n3.2 %\nCargo Revenue\n196\n(19.7) %\nOther Revenue\n1,316\n13.6 %\nTotal Revenue\n11,107\n(0.6) %\nDecember 201 5 Quarter Guidance\nFollowing are Delta's projections for the December 2015 quarter:\n4Q15 Forecast\nPassenger unit revenue (compared to 4Q14)\n(2.5%) - (4.5%)\nOperating margin\n16% - 18%\nFuel price, including taxes, settled hedges and refinery impact\n$1.75-$1.80\nCASM - Ex (compared to 4Q14)\nUp ~2%\nSystem capacity (compared to 4Q14)\nFlat\nCost Performance\nAdjusted fuel expense 2 declined over $1.1 billion compared to the same period in 2014, as 50% lower market fuel prices and an $87 million increase in profit at the refinery offset $250 million in settled hedge losses.\nCASM-Ex 3 increased 0.9% for the September quarter on a year-over-year basis, with foreign exchange and the benefits of Delta's domestic refleeting and other cost initiatives offsetting the company's investments in its employees, products and operations. The September quarter also included approximately 1 point of unit cost pressure from benefit accruals related to recently announced pay increases for Delta employees.\nDelta's debt reduction initiative continued to improve the company's interest expense, producing $33 million in interest savings for the quarter compared to the same period in 2014.\n\"We continue to benefit from the decline in fuel prices, which provided a $1 billion -plus tailwind this quarter and, at current prices, will drive a $750 million benefit in the December quarter,\" said Paul Jacobson , Delta's chief financial officer. \"With volatile fuel prices and revenues under pressure, we are using the current environment to evaluate and prune costs across all parts of the business, including our overhead functions, making sure we're investing in the right parts of the airline and at levels we can sustain over time.\"\nCash Flow , Shareholder Returns, and Adjusted Net Debt 4\nDelta generated $2.4 billion of adjusted operating cash flow and $1.4 billion of free cash flow during the quarter. The company used this strong cash generation to reinvest $1.0 billion back into the business, including $450 million for its 3.5% ownership position in China Eastern . The company returned $532 million to its owners through $107 million of dividends and $425 million of share repurchases, while also strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its adjusted net debt to $6.4 billion .\nDuring the quarter, Delta refinanced its senior secured credit facility ahead of its scheduled maturity. The new borrowings include a $1.5 billion undrawn revolver, a $500 million term loan, and a $500 million EETC with a blended rate of 3.77%. The improved strength of Delta's balance sheet allowed it to lower the overall rate on the borrowing and increase its revolver capacity by $275 million . In addition, the company reduced the outstanding principal amount by $320 million as it continues toward its $4 billion debt target by 2017.\n\"The strong cash flows we are producing are allowing us to reinvest in our business and our employees, while working toward achieving an investment grade balance sheet and also returning increasing levels of cash to shareholders,\" Jacobson continued. \"Since initiating our capital return program, we have already retired 8% of Delta's outstanding share count while reducing our adjusted net debt by nearly $4 billion over that same time period.\"\nGAAP Metrics Related to Fuel, Cost Performance and Cash Flow\nBelow are GAAP metrics corresponding to the non-GAAP figures cited above.\n($ in millions except per share and unit costs)\nChange\n3Q15\n3Q14\n$\n%\nNet income\n1,315\n357\n958\nNM\nDiluted earnings per share\n1.65\n0.42\n1.23\nNM\nFuel expense (including regional carriers)\n2,076\n3,444\n(1,368)\n(40%)\nConsolidated unit cost\n13.07\n15.69\n(2.62)\n(17%)\nOperating cash flow\n2,067\n1,358\n709\n52%\nSpecial Items\nSpecial items, net of taxes, in the September 2015 quarter totaled $69 million , including:\nA $69 million charge primarily for mark-to-market adjustments on fuel hedges settling in future periods.

MTM adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the period. These items adjust fuel expense to show the economic impact of hedging, including cash received or paid on hedge contracts during the period. See Note A for a reconciliation of adjusted fuel expense and average fuel price per gallon to the comparable GAAP metric.\n(3)\nCASM - Ex: In addition to fuel expense, profit sharing and special items, Delta believes adjusting for certain other expenses is helpful to investors because other expenses are not related to the generation of a seat mile. These expenses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services Delta provides to third parties, Delta's vacation wholesale operations, and refinery cost of sales to third parties. The amounts excluded were $306 million and $239 million for the September 2015 and September 2014 quarters, respectively and $945 million and $616 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management believes this methodology provides a more consistent and comparable reflection of Delta's airline operations.\n(4)\nAdjusted net debt includes $381 million of hedge margin receivable, which is cash that we have posted with counterparties as hedge margin. See Note A for additional information about our calculation of adjusted net debt.\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not historical facts, including statements regarding our estimates, expectations, beliefs, intentions, projections or strategies for the future, may be \"forward-looking statements\" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the period. These items adjust fuel expense to show the economic impact of hedging, including cash received or paid on hedge contracts during the period. Adjusting for these items allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.\nRestructuring and other. Because of the variability in restructuring and other, the adjustment for this item is helpful to investors to analyze the company's recurring core performance in the period shown.\nVirgin Atlantic MTM adjustments. We record our proportionate share of earnings from our equity investment in Virgin Atlantic in other expense. We adjust for Virgin Atlantic's MTM adjustments to allow investors to better understand and analyze the company's core financial performance in the period shown.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. We adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt in 2014 to assist investors with their analysis of the company's core financial performance.\nIncome tax. Pre-tax income is adjusted for the income tax effect of special items. We believe this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze the company's core financial performance in the periods shown.\nThree Months Ended\nNet Income\nSeptember 30, 2015\nPer Diluted Share\nPre-Tax\nIncome\nNet\nThree Months Ended\n(in millions, except per share data)\nIncome\nTax\nIncome\nSeptember 30, 2015\nGAAP\n$ 2,072\n$ (757)\n$ 1,315\n$ 1.65\nAdjusted for:\nMTM adjustments and settlements\n99\n(38)\n61\nVirgin Atlantic MTM adjustments\n13\n(5)\n8\nTotal adjustments\n112\n(43)\n69\n0.09\nNon-GAAP\n$ 2,184\n$ (800)\n$ 1,384\n$ 1.74\nThree Months Ended\nNet Income\nSeptember 30, 2014\nPer Diluted Share\nPre-Tax\nIncome\nNet\nThree Months Ended\n(in millions, except per share data)\nIncome\nTax\nIncome\nSeptember 30, 2014\nGAAP\n$ 579\n$ (222)\n$ 357\n$ 0.42\nAdjusted for:\nMTM adjustments and settlements\n347\n(132)\n215\nRestructuring and other\n570\n(215)\n355\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n134\n(51)\n83\nVirgin Atlantic MTM adjustments\n7\n(3)\n4\nTotal adjustments\n1,058\n(401)\n657\n0.78\nNon-GAAP\n$ 1,637\n$ (623)\n$ 1,014\n$ 1.20\nOperating Margin, adjusted. We adjust for the following items to determine operating margin, adjusted for the reasons described below:\nMTM adjustments and settlements. MTM adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the period. These items adjust fuel expense to show the economic impact of hedging, including cash received or paid on hedge contracts during the period. Adjusting for these items allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.\nRestructuring and other. Because of the variability in restructuring and other, the adjustment for this item is helpful to investors to analyze the company's recurring core performance in the periods shown.\nRefinery Sales. Delta's refinery segment provides jet fuel to the airline segment from its own production and from jet fuel obtained through agreements with third parties. Activities of the refinery segment are primarily for the benefit of the airline. However, from time to time, the refinery sells fuel by-products to third parties. These sales are recorded gross within other revenue and other operating expense. We believe adjusting for refinery sales allows investors to better understand and analyze the impact of fuel cost on our results in the periods shown.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2015\n2014\nOperating margin\n19.9%\n7.5%\nAdjusted for:\nMTM adjustments and settlements\n0.9%\n3.1%\nRestructuring and other\n-\n5.1%\nRefinery sales\n0.2%\n0.1%\nOperating margin, adjusted\n21.0%\n15.8%\nFree Cash Flow. We present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Adjustments include:\nHedge deferrals. During the March 2015 quarter, we effectively deferred settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2016 by entering into fuel derivative transactions that, excluding market movements from the date of the transactions, would provide approximately $150 million in cash receipts during the September 2015 quarter and $150 million in cash receipts for the December 2015 quarter. Additionally, these transactions will require approximately $300 million in cash payments in 2016 (excluding market movements from the date of the transactions). By effectively deferring settlement of a portion of the original derivative transactions, the restructured hedge portfolio provides additional time for the fuel market to stabilize while adding some hedge protection in 2016. Free cash flow is adjusted to include these deferral transactions in order to allow investors to better understand the net impact of hedging activities in the period shown.\nHedge margin. Free cash flow is adjusted for hedge margin as we believe this adjustment removes the impact of current market volatility on our unsettled hedges and allows investors to better understand and analyze the company's core operational performance in the period shown.\nThree Months Ended\n(in billions)\nSeptember 30, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 2.1\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(1.0)\nAdjustments:\nHedge deferrals\n0.1\nHedge margin\n0.2\nTotal free cash flow\n$ 1.4\nFuel expense, adjusted and Average fuel price per gallon, adjusted. The tables below show the components of fuel expense, including the impact of the refinery segment and hedging on fuel expense and average price per gallon. We then adjust for MTM adjustments and settlements for the reason described below:\nMTM adjustments and settlements. MTM adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the period. These items adjust fuel expense to show the economic impact of hedging, including cash received or paid on hedge contracts during the period. Adjusting for these items allows investors to better understand and analyze our core operational performance in the periods shown.\nConsolidated:\nAverage Price Per Gallon\nThree Months Ended\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions, except per gallon data)\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nFuel purchase cost\n$ 1,833\n$ 3,179\n$ 1.67\n$ 2.98\nAirline segment fuel hedge losses\n349\n284\n0.32\n0.27\nRefinery segment impact\n(106)\n(19)\n(0.10)\n(0.02)\nTotal fuel expense\n$ 2,076\n$ 3,444\n$ 1.89\n$ 3.23\nMTM adjustments and settlements\n(99)\n(347)\n(0.09)\n(0.33)\nTotal fuel expense, adjusted\n$ 1,977\n$ 3,097\n$ 1.80\n$ 2.90\nAverage Price Per Gallon\nNine Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n(in millions, except per gallon data)\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nFuel purchase cost\n$ 5,519\n$ 8,956\n$ 1.81\n$ 3.04\nAirline segment fuel hedge losses\n690\n112\n0.23\n0.04\nRefinery segment impact\n(282)\n9\n(0.09)\n-\nTotal fuel expense\n$ 5,927\n$ 9,077\n$ 1.95\n$ 3.08\nMTM adjustments and settlements\n1,210\n(380)\n0.40\n(0.13)\nTotal fuel expense, adjusted\n$ 7,137\n$ 8,697\n$ 2.35\n$ 2.95\nMainline:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\n2015\n2014\n2015\n2014\nMainline average price per gallon\n$ 1.93\n$ 3.25\n$ 1.97\n$ 3.07\nMTM adjustments and settlements\n(0.11)\n(0.38)\n0.47\n(0.15)\nMainline average price per gallon, adjusted\n$ 1.82\n$ 2.87\n$ 2.44\n$ 2.92\nNon-Fuel Unit Cost or Cost per Available Seat Mile (\"CASM-Ex\"). We adjust CASM for the following items to determine CASM-Ex for the reasons described below:\nAircraft fuel and related taxes. The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year non-fuel financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes (including our regional carriers) allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and our year-over-year financial performance.\nProfit sharing. We adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.\nRestructuring and other. Because of the variability in restructuring and other, the adjustment for this item is helpful to investors to analyze the company's recurring core performance in the periods shown.\nOther expenses. Other expenses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties, our vacation wholesale operations, and refinery cost of sales to third parties. Because these businesses are not related to the generation of a seat mile, we adjust for the costs related to these sales to provide a more meaningful comparison of the costs of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.\nConsolidated CASM-Ex:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2015\nSeptember 30, 2014\nSeptember 30, 2015\nSeptember 30, 2014\nCASM (cents)\n13.07\n15.69\n13.32\n15.24\nAdjusted for:\nAircraft fuel and related taxes\n(3.05)\n(5.22)\n(3.14)\n(4.99)\nProfit sharing\n(0.83)\n(0.58)\n(0.59)\n(0.45)\nRestructuring and other\n-\n(0.86)\n(0.02)\n(0.36)\nOther expenses\n(0.45)\n(0.37)\n(0.50)\n(0.34)\nCASM-Ex\n8.74\n8.66\n9.07\n9.10\nYear-over-year change\n0.9%\nMainline CASM-Ex:\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2015\nSeptember 30, 2014\nSeptember 30, 2015\nSeptember 30, 2014\nMainline CASM (cents)\n12.68\n14.90\n12.80\n14.34\nAdjusted for:\nAircraft fuel and related taxes\n(2.97)\n(5.00)\n(3.03)\n(4.72)\nProfit Sharing\n(0.92)\n(0.65)\n(0.66)\n(0.51)\nRestructuring and other\n-\n(0.85)\n-\n(0.32)\nOther expenses\n(0.44)\n(0.36)\n(0.50)\n(0.33)\nMainline CASM-Ex\n8.35\n8.04\n8.61\n8.46\nOperating Cash Flow, adjusted. We present adjusted operating cash flow because management believes adjusting for these amounts provides a more meaningful measure for investors. Adjustments include:\nHedge deferrals. During the March 2015 quarter, we effectively deferred settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2016 by entering into fuel derivative transactions that, excluding market movements from the date of the transactions, would provide approximately $150 million in cash receipts during the September 2015 quarter and $150 million in cash receipts for the December 2015 quarter. Additionally, these transactions will require approximately $300 million in cash payments in 2016 (excluding market movements from the date of the transactions). By effectively deferring settlement of a portion of the original derivative transactions, the restructured hedge portfolio provides additional time for the fuel market to stabilize while adding some hedge protection in 2016. Operating cash flow is adjusted to include these deferral transactions in order to allow investors to better understand the net impact of hedging activities in the period shown.\nHedge margin. Operating cash flow is adjusted for hedge margin as we believe this adjustment removes the impact of current market volatility on our unsettled hedges and allows investors to better understand and analyze the company's core operational performance in the period shown.\nThree Months Ended\n(in billions)\nSeptember 30, 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)\n$ 2.1\nAdjustments:\nHedge deferrals\n0.1\nHedge margin\n0.2\nNet cash provided by operating activities, adjusted\n$ 2.4\nCapital Expenditures, net. Delta presents net capital expenditures, which includes strategic investments, because management believes adjusting for these amounts provides a more meaningful financial measure for investors. This metric is adjusted for reimbursements related to build-to-suit leased facilities and other because management believes investors should be informed that these reimbursements for build-to-suit leased facilities effectively reduce net cash provided by operating activities and related capital expenditures.\nThree Months Ended\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30, 2015\nProperty and equipment additions\n$ 562\nInvestment in China Eastern\n450\nInvestment in GOL\n50\nReimbursements related to build-to-suit leased facilities and other\n(23)\nCapital expenditures, net\n$ 1,039\nAdjusted Net Debt. Delta uses adjusted total debt, including aircraft rent, in addition to long-term adjusted debt and capital leases, to present estimated financial obligations. Delta reduces adjusted debt by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and hedge margin receivable, resulting in adjusted net debt, to present the amount of assets needed to satisfy the debt. Management believes this metric is helpful to investors in assessing the company's overall debt profile. Management has reduced adjusted debt by the amount of hedge margin receivable, which reflects cash posted to counterparties, as we believe this removes the impact of current market volatility on our unsettled hedges and is a better representation of the continued progress we have made on our debt initiatives.\n(in billions)\nSeptember 30, 2015\nJune 30, 2013\nDebt and capital lease obligations\n$ 8.8\n$ 12.2\nPlus: unamortized discount, net from purchase accounting and fresh start reporting\n-\n0.4\nLess: debt assumed in connection with Pinnacle acquisition\n-\n(0.2)\nAdjusted debt and capital lease obligations\n$ 8.8\n$ 12.4\nPlus: 7x last twelve months' aircraft rent\n1.8\n1.7\nAdjusted total debt\n10.6\n14.1\nLess: cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\nLess: hedge margin receivable\n(0.4)\n-\nAdjusted net debt\n$ 6.4\n$ 10.2\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090202/DELTALOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delta-air-lines-announces-september-quarter-profit-300159231.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/delta", "http://takingoff.delta.com/", "http://www.skyteam.com/", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&cat=36", "http://www.alitalia.com/", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=20309&item=30160", "http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/where-we-fly/flight-partners.html#connection", "http://www.delta.com/", "https://plus.google.com/+Delta/posts", "http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/gb/en.html", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/delta-air-lines-announces-september-quarter-profit-300159231.html", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=109", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=108", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=107", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20090202/DELTALOGO", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=104", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=103", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=102", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=101", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=100", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CL27349&Transmission_Id=201510140700PR_NEWS_USPR_____CL27349&DateId=20151014", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=18&item=131", "http://www.airfranceklm-finance.com/en", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=20309&item=30135", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090202/DELTALOGO", "http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=20309&item=30138", "http://news.delta.com/", "https://twitter.com/DeltaNewsHub"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:16:09.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
