My fried who is travelling with me is staying on for two week afterwards so we're trying to plan our trip. Obviously i want to visit a lot of places and fit in my main interests but i'm not sure it's all possible in the 3 weeks i have and i don't want to the trip to be too hectic! Here is what i'm thinking so far, any advice on the trip as a whole, travel or anything i'm missing would be great!
