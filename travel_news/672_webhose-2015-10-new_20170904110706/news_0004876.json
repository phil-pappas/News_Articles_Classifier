The latter causes the coral to encase itself in its own skeleton leading to death.\nThese effects were observed as low as 62 parts per trillion, the equivalent to a drop of water in six and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools\nMeasurements of oxybenzone in seawater within coral reefs in Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands found concentrations ranging from 800 parts per trillion to 1.4 parts per million. This is over 12 times higher than the concentrations necessary to impact on coral.\nA team of marine scientists from Virginia , Florida , Israel , the National Aquarium (US) and the US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, undertook the study. Lead author Dr. Craig Downs of Haereticus Environmental Laboratory Virginia, said, \"The use of oxybenzone-containing products needs to be seriously deliberated in islands and areas where coral reef conservation is a critical issue. We have lost at least 80% of the coral reefs in the Caribbean . Any small effort to reduce oxybenzone pollution could mean that a coral reef survives a long, hot summer, or that a degraded area recovers. Everyone wants to build coral nurseries for reef restoration, but this will achieve little if the factors that originally killed off the reef remain or intensify in the environment.\"\nBetween 6,000 and 14,000 tons of sunscreen lotion are emitted into coral reef areas each year, much of which contains between one and 10% oxybenzone.\nFurther information about the study can be found at http://www.haereticus-lab.org and marinesafe.org.\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
