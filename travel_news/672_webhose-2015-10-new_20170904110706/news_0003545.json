Getty Images Tourists visit Acropolis Hill in Athens, June 23, 2015. \nThe move has attracted ire from the Federal Hellenic Association of Travel and Tourist Agencies (FHATTA), which is now asking for a more gradual increase to ticket prices over three years in order to keep the country's tourism industry competitive. \nVarious media reports suggested famous sites like the Acropolis Museum in the capital of Athens would see prices rise from 12 to 20 euros ($22), and passes to the National Archaeological Museum creep up from 7 to 10 euros ($11). It was also reported that the hike would raise at least 21 million euros ($24 million) for the Greek government. \nHowever exact prices and expected revenue were not immediately confirmed by the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports, which said a press issue was slated for release later Thursday. \nIt comes as Greece looks to roll out new austerity measures after clinching a bailout deal with creditors earlier this year worth approximately 86 billion euro ($98 billion). â€¹", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:45:52.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
