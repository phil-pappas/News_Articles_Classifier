It’s a space that is so revealing of a person’s true character and habits, yet often overlooked. The nightstand in its many forms (stool, table, chest of drawers) is probably the last thing you see when falling asleep and the first you reach for upon waking. So why is it that our faithful nighttime companion, harboring the most important of bedtime essentials, is often transformed into a junk receptacle for old books, tangled chargers, and unused papers? And perhaps more important, how does all this clutter affect your sleep?\n“Any time you have lots of clutter, let’s say a to-do list or a stack of unread books next to your bed, it’s not conducive to a peaceful night’s sleep,” says holistic feng shui expert Laura Benko. Benko, author of the new book The Holistic Home: Feng Shui for Mind, Body, Spirit, Space , credits the nightstand as being the energetic anchor to your bed. “If the surface of your nightstand is covered with things, it’s going to affect you in ways of not being able to have clarity yourself.” When clients can’t sleep, she urges them to look at the symbolism in the room, and more specifically at the objects closely situated next to them at night. Among the items most detrimental to a peaceful sleep environment? Alarm clocks, chargers, electronics, and phones. She advises placing them across the room, paving the way for a clean, clear, and tidy nightstand surface and allowing space for a selection of specially curated objects.\nAccording to Benko, the imagery and objects you choose to place beside you can make all the difference in shifting the energy of the room. She suggests choosing decorative objects with intention and purpose, such as a plant, which energizes and adds vitality to your space. She also recommends sleep sprays containing essential oils, which you mist on your sheets and pillows to calm and relax your body and mind. Lastly, consolidate any items that may typically be loose or scattered, such as matches or jewelry, into a large, clean container.\nAbove, find 12 stylish ways to restore tranquility to your nightstand—making way for your best night’s sleep yet.\nVogue may earn compensation on these sales through affiliate programs.", "external_links": ["http://www.laurabenko.com/my-book-the-holistic-home-feng-shui-your-mind-body-spirit-space/"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:05:11.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
