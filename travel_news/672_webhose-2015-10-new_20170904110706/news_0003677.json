This is what grown-ups call a sandcastle.\nA group of sand sculptors has taken playing with a bucket and spade to a whole new level in the Netherlands.\nTo coincide with the annual sand sculpture festivals taking place in the Dutch cities of Oss and Sneek, festival organisers Global PowWow have built from scratch two one-bedroom sandcastles.\nCalled the Sand Hotel, the two “buildings” consist of thin walls, covered inside and out with reinforced sand to ensure they don’t disintegrate in the rain or wind.\nThe rooms are hidden inside eight-meter-high sand sculptures, one decorated with a Terracotta Warriors theme, one of China’s top tourist attractions, and the other is modelled on the Flintstones’ cartoon home town of Bedrock.\nThe suites are decked out with a queen bed, carpet, a bathroom with running water, electricity, Wi-Fi, windows and cost €150 a night (about $235) based on double occupancy.\nSandcastles just got an upgrade.
