That’s the fate of finance ministers. But it’s particularly the case at the moment because many have already used a lot of their fiscal buffers… and are always in need of some fiscal buffers in order to fight the next crisis,” she said.\nLagarde urged governments to tax carbon emissions rather than rely on emissions trading, a competing system already in place in Europe in which governments essentially issue permits to pollute that can then be traded on an open market.\n“I know that a lot of people would rather do emissions trading systems, but we believe that carbon taxation would be a lot better,” she said.\nLagarde said revenues from carbon taxes could contribute to rich nations’ funding target of USD 100 billion a year by 2020 to help poorer nations fight the impacts of climate change.\nThe world was still USD 38 billion short of that target last year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a new report.\nChristine Lagarde said it was also the “right moment” to eliminate energy subsidies, which the IMF says will cost the world USD 5.3 trillion this year – 6.5 per cent of the global economy.\nFirst Published on October 08, 2015 10:59 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:54:45.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
