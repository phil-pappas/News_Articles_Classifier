The crowds in Paris, Hong Kong, and the Rockies have dispersed, and the weather is just about perfect. \"And once the 'high season' has ended, in early September, you can count on finding some great deals on airfare and lodging,\" Kathy Sudeikis, vice president of the American Society of Travel Agents \nBut nothing ruins a holiday like an ill-timed virus or a prescription that can't be filled in a foreign pharmacy. \"When travelling, medical emergencies happen more often than you think,\" warns Paul Danao, international director for Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. \nSo take a moment to scan these suggestions before you kennel the dog and head to the airport. \nFollowing these guidelines will help you steer clear of medical misadventures while you're away. \nA MONTH BEFORE YOU LEAVE \nGet immunised early if going abroad: In addition to stocking up on glossy guidebooks, check the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention destination-specific lists of recommended vaccinations and health precautions. You may need to get some immunisations (such as the vaccine against Japanese encephalitis, a hazard in parts of Southeast Asia) at least a month before departing. \nGet a checkup: See your primary care physician for vaccinations and to make sure you're leaving in shipshape condition. If you'll be traversing time zones, ask your doc whether you should continue taking your medication at your regular, home-zone time, or switch - and how. And be sure to ask if any culinary specialties you're likely to encounter while away might interact with your medication. Leafy greens, for example, can decrease the effects of some blood-thinning drugs. If you take such drugs, and are heading off to soul-food country, don't go overboard with the collard greens. \nREAD MORE: 13 tips to help you stay healthy while flying \nGet two letters from your doctor if you're crossing international borders:The first should explain any medical problems you have, and their treatment. It'll come in handy if you need to consult with health care providers while away. You'll also need one that lists prescription medication (including their generic names) and any alternative remedies you take, as well as why, when, how (whether you use a syringe, for instance), and at what dosage. Ad Feedback \nThe letter should note that the quantity you're packing is appropriate for your needs, because every country has its own rules about bringing prescription drugs across its borders. Having all the proper documentation will ease your way through customs and help you get replacement medication should you lose yours en route. \nConsider travellers insurance. \"For peace of mind, call your health insurance company before leaving to find out exactly what's covered when you are travelling abroad,\" says Danao. Many policies don't cover evacuation or nonemergency care abroad, so ask. \nWHILE PACKING \nGet your numbers straight. Program your doctor's contact information into your cell phone, or jot it in your address book. \nKeep your medication in their original containers. This goes for all medicines - prescription, over-the-counter, and alternative. If you need a syringe, make sure it's in a clearly labelled container, too. You'll make life easier for security staff at airports and border crossings. \nCarry must-take medication onboard. If you're flying, put prescription drugs, and any syringes you might need, in your carry-on bag, so they're accessible and safe. (That letter from your doc explaining why you need the needles should satisfy airport security.) Storage conditions in cargo holds can affect the stability of certain medication, explains Stefanie Ferreri, a doctor of pharmacy and pharmacy professor. Also, in case of an unexpected delay returning, be sure to pack at least two additional days' worth. \nRemember your paperwork. Make a copy of those prescriptions and letters from your doctor; then put one set in your carry-on and another in a suitcase. If one gets lost or stolen, you'll have a backup. \nON THE PLANE \nFlex your muscles. Sit still for more than 2 hours, and the blood in your veins can pool and form potentially life-threatening clots. Prevent the problem (known medically as deep vein thrombosis but popularly as \"economy-class syndrome\") by walking the length of the plane every couple of hours. \nTNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:10:39.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
