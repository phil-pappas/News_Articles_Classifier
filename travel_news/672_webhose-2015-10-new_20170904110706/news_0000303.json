However, the two-wheeler tyre segment is expected to exhibit fastest growth over the next five years, followed by the OTR tyre segment. Few of the major tyre brands operating in the country include Fate, Bridgestone, Pirelli, Michelin, Yokohama , Goodyear and Hankook. With around two-thirds of the market share, Pampas, Dry Pampas, and Pampas Sierras regions of Argentina dominated the county's tyre market in 2014, and this regional domination is expected to continue during 2015-20.\nWith a population of 43 million and a vehicle fleet of over 18 million units in 2014, Argentina has evolved as the second largest market for automotive tyres in South America . However, the automobile market of the country has been grappling due to economic instability, devaluation of Argentina Peso, high inflation and decreasing automobile exports over last few years. These factors led to decline in automobile sales and production during 2012 - 2014. Despite such a scenario in automobile sales, the country's demand witnessed a rise during 2010-14 in volume terms. Backed by expanding fleet size, the tyre market in Argentina is dominated by the replacement tyre market.\nArgentina Tyre Market Forecast & Opportunities, 2020 report elaborates following aspects of tyre market expansion in Argentina :\nGrowth in Domestic Tyre Manufacturing Expanding Tyre Retreading Market Increase Online Purchase of Tyres Reviving Automobile Production & Sales Declining Tyre Exports Key Topics Covered:\n1.
