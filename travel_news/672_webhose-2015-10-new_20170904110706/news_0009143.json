Because it’s a crossover, we wanted to test the V60 Cross Country in a variety of conditions. So our journeys encompassed lengthy motorway hauls, a healthy quantity of busy A roads and a liberal peppering of winding country lanes. We even took it down a few dirt tracks, just for good measure. How many miles did you cover? What was the average mpg? In the course of a week, I put about 600 or so miles on the V60 Cross Country. That included one long drive with a carful of colleagues, who offered detailed feedback on the experience. I’m pleased to report that only one aspect of the car came in for repeated criticism: the driver. Beyond that, there was considerable satisfaction all-round, not least from me. After all, achieving more than 60 miles per gallon when the car’s chock-full of people and their kit is not to be sniffed at. What most surprised you about this car? I was taken aback by how rugged it felt. When I’d seen launch photos of the V60 Cross Country, I’d assumed it would just be a slightly elevated version of the standard estate version. And in some respects it is, not least when you’re behind the wheel enjoying its taut handling and responsive drive. But thanks to some important tweaks, including to the styling and the suspension set-up, it’s extremely robust. In short, this car has the look and feel of a bona fide SUV, albeit one with great fuel economy and estate-car performance. It’s like having your cake and eating it. While driving a cool car at the same time. What piece of technology did you most appreciate on the car? Oh satellite navigation, how I love thee. I was summoned to a job in the middle of Dartmoor, where the only other forms of life encountered tend to have all-over body hair and at least four legs. Needless to say, the only clue as to my eventual destination was a postcode. But thanks to Volvo’s user-friendly interface and crystal-clear navigation software, I got there with nary a missed junction along the way. Even better, I made it back home again, too. What impact did this car have on your driving? The slight increase in ground clearance gave me confidence around the narrow lanes near home. We affectionately call this network of dismal roads the “dual cabbage way”, in a reflection of the greenery sprouting through the asphalt and frequently becoming snagged on the underside of our cars. With the V60 Cross Country, there was no cause for alarm. Even when meeting other traffic, I simply took to the verge, confident in the car’s ability to clear the vegetation. What’s good about this car from a business driver’s perspective? It’s the combination of distinctive styling and highly competitive running costs. The V60 Cross Country has a gravitas that sets it apart in the office parking lot. But that doesn’t come at too high a price. For example, the benefit in kind income tax works out at around £100 a month for a 20pc tax payer, and is just over £200 if you pay at the higher rate. The competitive fuel economy also keeps running costs down. It just goes to prove that you can afford to be different when it comes to your choice of company car. Did anything unusual happen while you had the car? I can honestly say I have never done this before in more than two decades of working as a motoring journalist. I pretended the car was mine, just for the thrill of seeing someone believe I could own such a vehicle. And by golly, it felt wonderful. What did your family make of the car? It was an instant hit. My Audi-driving brother was impressed by the build quality, and loved the sharp styling of the front end. As for my two-year-old son, he tried hard to persuade the girls at nursery that the car was ours to keep. Don’t know who gave him that idea… What makes this car stand out from the competition? The V60 Cross Country’s looks go a long way to underscoring its distinctive appeal. But fantastic performance, flawless comfort, excellent economy and – of course – world-beating safety show that the car’s beauty is more than skin deep. What would you tell your best friend about this car? It is my new car, honest. Why would I lie about a thing like that? • Get your business on the road – call the Volvo Car Business Centre on 0345 600 4027 or visit volvocars.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:42:11.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
