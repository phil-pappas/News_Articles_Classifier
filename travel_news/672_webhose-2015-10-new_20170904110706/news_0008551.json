The agency has earned a reputation for understanding the unique needs and challenges of those who earn their livelihood in the food and beverage industry. Easing some of the stress that comes with owning and managing a hospitality-based business is the primary mission of the professionals at FNBIA.\nThe FNBIA Difference\nThe team of industry insiders at FNBIA have decades of combined experience in both commercial insurance and in the restaurant industry. The agency has consistently demonstrated reliability and trust while cultivating integrity in all of its client relationships. By making ethical business practices part of the agency's DNA, FNBIA has managed to earn respect and build strong relationships across the hospitality landscape. Strong client feedback is a testament to the quality of the agency's personalized services.\n\"It's great doing business with a company that gives us several options,\" remarked one bar owner. \"After shopping around a bit, FNBIA just seemed to know what they were doing. I know I made the right decision.\"\nOne nightclub owner has trusted FNBIA to deliver policies for eight different establishments over the course of a decade. \"I appreciate the personal service and the ability to have a human agent on speed dial who I know will be there should I need her.\"\nPositive word of mouth has been a big reason why FNBIA's sphere of influence includes every major metro area in Texas . On the insurance carrier side, FNBIA has worked tirelessly to foster strong, mutually beneficial partnerships enabling business owners to tailor packages that precisely fit their requirements.\nRestaurant Insurance\nAccording to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , tens of thousands of food service employees are hurt each year, many of them seriously enough to miss days and weeks of work. In kitchens, the most common injuries are cuts, burns, repetitive use injuries and orthopedic injuries like sprained ankles. Accidents resulting from unsafe conditions can leave the business owner liable for medical expenses and perhaps punitive damages. These statistics do not even address the potential for patrons to get hurt slipping on a wet floor or becoming ill after eating undercooked animal products.\nTo keep these accidents from driving a restaurant out of business, FNBIA helps owners find quality insurance at the right price that fits their needs. The agency works on behalf of both small diners and large, multi-location chains.\nRestaurant insurance comes in several different forms. Business owner's insurance is a catchall that encompasses many other types, such as liability and property insurance. The advantage of business owner's insurance is the ability for policies to be highly personalized. Some other specific types of insurance include general liability insurance, workers' compensation and vehicle insurance.\nBar, Pub and Liquor Liability\nWhen an establishment sells beer, wine or liquor by the drink, it's held to a much higher standard of liability. For instance, if an employee overserves a patron, who then leaves and causes a serious car accident, the business could be on the hook for significant damages and penalties. Even a small mishap that results from alcohol can force a bar to close its doors, in the event that the owner neglected to take out liquor liability insurance.\nAs with restaurant insurance, liquor liability insurance is not a one-policy-fits-all product. Because establishments selling alcohol must meet strict licensing requirements, opting not to purchase a policy is a non-starter. FNBIA helps bar owners stay compliant and protect their employees and patrons, all without breaking the bank.\nAbout Food and Beverage Insurance Agency\nThe mission of Food and Beverage Insurance Agency (FNBIA) is to help restaurateurs and bar/nightclub owners prepare for the unexpected. FNBIA is there not just as an agent, but also as a trusted partner so that business owners will be ready for the unexpected when it does occur â€“ because accidents and mishaps do happen.\nFNBIA works hand in hand with leading carriers to provide insurance programs designed specifically for restaurants, bars and nightclubs. By taking advantage of trend-setting technology, we are able to provide top shelf service to clients throughout Texas . Our clients range in size from the small hole-in-the-wall bars to multiple location restaurants and clubs.\nContact:\nJoe Thomas\nFood and Beverage Insurance Agency\n56 Sugar Creek Center Blvd., Ste. 175\nSugar Land, TX 77478\n832-252-9071 ext. 103\n832-201-8409 Fax\nEmail\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/food-and-beverage-insurance-agency-helps-texas-business-owners-find-right-fit-for-restaurant-bar-liquor-liability-insurance-300153645.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=291549", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/food-and-beverage-insurance-agency-helps-texas-business-owners-find-right-fit-for-restaurant-bar-liquor-liability-insurance-300153645.html", "http://www.mybarandrestaurant.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.osha.gov/dte/grant_materials/fy09/sh-19478-09/roc_employer_ergo_manual.pdf", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH18899&Transmission_Id=201510050840PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH18899&DateId=20151005"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:28:15.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
