After a tough critique from the expert jury, Jordan's Maymoona Ayesh and Lebanon's Adib Al Ghossein's journeys on the program came to an end. To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7665751-prototypes-algerian-syrian-innovators/ On Stars of Science , Qatar Foundation's\"edutainment reality\" TV program, young innovators compete against each other to turn their ideas into reality. Twelve candidates aged 18 to 30 from across the Arab world travel to Doha, Qatar , where they are mentored by world-class engineering and design specialists in the laboratories of Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP), a member of Qatar Foundation. There, the innovators take on challenges as they develop their ideas from a concept to a potential product, highlighting the show's dedication to QF's vision of fostering a culture of quality and excellence. In the engineering stage, candidates were tasked with creating a working prototype of their ideas with the help of expert mentors. Their prototypes, the result of countless hours in the laboratory, can potentially have impact in many different fields. Maymoona's Date Pits Filter in Desalination, a water filter that uses pits of the popular fruit to remove salt in order to make saltwater consumable, and Yaman's Solar Washing Machine, which recycles water and runs on solar energy, are modern innovations that address the need for water and energy conservation. 1 of 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:17:36.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
