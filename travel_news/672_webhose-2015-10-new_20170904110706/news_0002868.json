I think people have really enjoyed this competition, something a little bit different. It definitely exceeds our expectations for our inaugural year.\"\nRead More According to the rules, all of the photos had to have been taken in the wild.\nThat means no domestic animals and no animals that live in zoos or other captive environments.\nThe next stage of judging will happen later this month, say organizers, with the winners due to be announced on November 11.\nPrizes include photographic safaris in southern Tanzania and Nikon cameras.\nCheck out the above gallery for a few of our favorite finalists.", "external_links": ["http://comedywildlifephoto.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:00:08.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
