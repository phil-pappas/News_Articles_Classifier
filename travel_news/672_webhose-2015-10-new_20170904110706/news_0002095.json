Artist proposals for site-specific sculptures or kinetic mobiles are now being accepted through Nov. 15, 2015. Five winners will be selected Dec.14, 2015.\n \n“Proposals from the past two years have been nothing less than exceptional, and the winning displays enhanced the Nashville Airports Experience for our passengers, business partners and employees,” said Rob Wigington, president and CEO of the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority. “This year we anticipate even more inspiring proposals that both reflect our Arts at the Airport program and showcase Bonnaroo’s impact on our statewide community.”\n \nThe selected displays will suspend from the ceiling and encompass five skylights located on each of the three concourses at BNA, beginning March 14, 2016, through January 22, 2017. Artists are being asked for proposals that will include iconic festival elements, a nod to Bonnaroo’s home base in Manchester, Tenn., and recognition of the festival’s unique Bonnaroovian Code. The winning artists will each receive a $2,000 honorarium and have their art displayed for the duration of the program.\n \n“The Arts at the Airport program is just one example of why we established the Bonnaroo Works Fund,” said festival co-producer Ashley Capps. “This program encourages and supports arts and artists while underscoring our commitment to Bonnaroo’s home state. I cannot think of a better way to be welcomed to Nashville than with the outstanding installations that are selected each year.”\n \nThe project is funded by Arts at the Airport and the Bonnaroo Works Fund, the charitable arm of the internationally acclaimed festival.\n \nSource:- Fly Nashville", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:41:28.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
