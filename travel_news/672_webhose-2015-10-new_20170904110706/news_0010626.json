A new generation of artists, galleries and art initiatives make this an attractive location for the sophisticated cultural traveller. This charming place, old in history, but young in spirit, is becoming a meeting point where East and West, established and upcoming, find a perfect junction to come together.\nThe best time to experience all this is the second week of October when Art Market Budapest is expecting 100 exhibitors from 25 countries to its fifth edition in 2015 and its connected programs take place. Art Market Budapest Week is a fresh occasion that will inspire art lovers to come to Budapest and take a closer look at a newly emerging artistic attraction. An extraordinarily rich program includes events at what is probably the most amazing fair location in Europe as well as lots of other venues presenting world-class contemporary art performances in co-operation with the CAFE Budapest Contemporary Art Festival.\nFour Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace Budapest has created an Art Market Budapest Package in collaboration with the art fair. Guests of Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace are invited to take advantage of becoming a VIP guest of Art Market Budpest, which allows one to enjoy contemporary art comfortably, and will also secure access to various exclusive services and events.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:12:48.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
