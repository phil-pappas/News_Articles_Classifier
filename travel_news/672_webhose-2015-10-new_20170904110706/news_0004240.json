(OTC: FARE) (BERLIN: WM7) ( BERLIN : A1J8SY) (\"World Moto\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in advanced solutions for motorcycle taxis and on-demand transport, today announced the crowdfunding launch of Wheelies™, a unique platform that brings videos and pictures to the wheels of motorbikes. The Kickstarter campaign introduces Wheelies to motorbike enthusiasts both in the United States and around the world at discounted pre-order prices.\n\"Our Wheelies™ innovation transforms any wheel in the world into a brilliant, full-color billboard or video screen,\" said World Moto CEO, Paul Giles . \"We believe the possibility of turning any vehicle into a money-making venture for both advertisers and social 'sharers' makes this new technology a strong contender for the crowdfunding fast-lane.\"\nWorld Moto's Wheelies™ project crystal clear images that can be seen as a motorbike moves at any speed. All digital content, including ads and videos, can be sequenced and triggered manually under the command of an operator using a smart device.\nWhile an industrial version of Wheelies™ has been in use for over a year, the Kickstarter campaign is introducing a personal version of the platform, complete with quick and easy installation instructions. Once installed, custom playlists of images and videos can be pre-loaded, and web content can be downloaded using a web-based application.\nWheelies™ will immediately allow anyone to begin making money by selling independent advertising space in the playlist on their device, and there are future plans for an advertising network that allows Wheelies™ users to earn money in the same way services like AdSense generate revenue for website owners.\nThe Wheelies™ Kickstarter campaign is targeted toward two distinct market segments:\nFor individuals, Wheelies™ are a personal digital canvas in the physical world, a beautiful and inspiring medium of self-expression, and a fun way to share content, engage, collaborate and create entirely new experiences. For advertisers, Wheelies™ are a high-impact medium for showcasing brands and businesses to new customers in locations of mass consumer exposure with the ability to target up to 400,000 people a day, per motorcycle. The smart device interactive feature gives Wheelies™ the ability to serve up highly targeted advertisements to different demographics. Wheelies™ is now accepting pledges and pre-orders on Kickstarter and the campaign will run through Novemember 28, 2015.
