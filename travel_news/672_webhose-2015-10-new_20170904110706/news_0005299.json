Here are some of the best restaurants for a great taste of Cologne , from fine dining to old-fashioned German cuisine. And wherever you go, there is something you will find on every menu in Cologne: the local beer called Kölsch, brewed exclusively in the Cologne region. This pale and light-bodied beer is served in thin, cylindrical glasses, and it is a tradition that beer pub waiters will bring you one Kölsch after the other, unless you leave your beer glass half full or cover it with your beer mat to let them know you are done. 1.
