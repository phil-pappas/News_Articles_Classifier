(NYSE: OA) said it has shipped the Cygnus spacecraft´s service module to NASA´s Kennedy Space Center for the next International Space Station (ISS) cargo mission, scheduled to launch on Thursday, December 3. \nThis mission milestone marks a key step forward as Orbital ATK continues its cargo delivery service to the ISS for NASA under the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract. \nThe Cygnus spacecraft will be assembled at Kennedy and launched aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The mission serves as the first flight of the enhanced variant of the Cygnus spacecraft, capable of delivering more than 7,700 pounds of essential crew supplies, equipment and scientific experiments to astronauts on board the ISS. \nFinal assembly, cargo loading and fueling of the Cygnus spacecraft will take place at the Kennedy Space Center prior to its integration with the Atlas V rocket. Like most Orbital ATK spacecraft, Cygnus is designed to be compatible with multiple launch vehicles. This capability supports NASA´s requirements for additional cargo and also provides better schedule assurance for future missions.
