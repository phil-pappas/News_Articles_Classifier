AIR FORCE MUSEUM \nThe RAF Vulcan crash-landed at Ohakea after a near-miss at the opening of Wellington Airport. \nAs the huge British Royal Air Force plane spewed fuel, Captain Tony Smailes avoided ploughing into crowds by going full throttle and pulling the plane and its five crew back into the air. They managed a crash-landing at Ohakea. \n\"Like a mighty bird alighting, the Vulcan bomber appears to perch on the edge of the Wellington Airport embankment,\" The Evening Post reported at the time. \nIt lost its left rear wheel as its undercarriage and left wingtip hit the ground. \nThat wasn't the only close call that day – earlier on October 25 the pilot of a Sunderland flying boat scraped the plane's belly on the runway during his low-level flyover – not knowing the Evans Bay end of the runway was about six metres higher than the Cook Strait end. The plane had to be quickly beached before it sank. \nUltimately disaster was avoided and thousands turned up amid much fanfare. The occasion followed a month of hype in both the capital's daily newspapers to the great unveiling, which marked the the end of one of New Zealand's largest civil engineering projects. \nConstruction began in 1953 and involved 135 acres of land reclamation, extensive road building and shifting of the sewer outfall as well as the relocation of 180 houses. \nIn the following six years, more than three million cubic metres of earth and rock was moved, including shifting Rongotai Hill. Houses that weren't demolished were moved to reclaimed land at Evans Bay. Ad Feedback \nThe airport cost an inflation-adjusted $216m to build, with Wellington City Council contributed stumping up about a third. \nLyall Bay had been Wellington's home of flight since Arthur Schaef built an aircraft in 1910, less than a decade after the Wright brothers' first flight, and flew it a few metres along Lyall Bay. \nSandhills were levelled for flying, then, in 1928, a couple of small runways were built. The next year, Charles Kingsford Smith touched down in Wellington at the end of the first trans-Tasman flight. \nGET THE BOOK \nThe Dominion Post - 150 Years of News is available via dompost.co.nz or 0800 50 50 90.
