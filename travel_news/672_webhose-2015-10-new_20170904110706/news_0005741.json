More Formula One closes in on $8.5bn sale \nShip brokers tracking the past two decades of market activity say that in recent months, global cruise ship investment has entered a new phase. But that observation comes with warnings from the past — explosive expansions of the cruise order book in 1999 and 2006 were followed by equally spectacular busts. \nThe traditional market will continue to depend on the retirement spending of baby boomers in the west but the growth outlook will be shaped by an Asian middle class bursting to spend their money and comparatively short vacations at sea. The question this time is whether the establishment of new Chinese brands and the development of Asian ports will make for a less bust-prone pattern. \nAfter an unprecedented 50 per cent year-on-year surge of orders in 2015, the market is expected to add an additional 146,000 passenger berths by 2020. \nNorth American and European passengers account for 85 per cent of the global cruise market of 22m passengers a year. But the signals of change are clear. \nThe Chinese government has thrown its weight behind the cruise industry and expects that 4.5m of its citizens will be taking a cruise each year by 2020. A more conservative prediction from Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, is for 3m annual passengers, or 10 per cent of the market. \nIn South Korea and Japan, which are a few days’ sea voyage from Shanghai and Tianjin, local ports are racing to expand their facilities to accommodate the new class of mega-ships, which could carry more than 6,000 passengers. \nThe major cruise companies, led by Carnival and Royal Caribbean , which together account for 80 per cent of the Chinese market, have begun sending new vessels to be permanently based in the east and fitted out with more shopping, more casinos and enclosed sun decks to tailor to local needs. \nLast week, Carnival doubled the number of its cruise brands in China to four, with two new ships arriving by 2017. Arnold Donald, chief executive, says the company wanted to offer “choice and variety” to match “the different tastes and preferences of Chinese travellers”. \nHe adds that Carnival may also launch a joint venture with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation and China Merchants Group to build a domestic Chinese cruise brand. \nRoyal Caribbean has sent its most advanced ships to China, complete with high-speed internet, smart bracelets for payments, a 300ft high viewing pod, robot bartenders, a rock climbing wall, bumper cars and a skydiving wind tunnel, in order to appeal to every generation of Chinese families. \nThe clearest evidence of the shift, say researchers at the UK-based brokerage Clarksons, has been orders for cruise ships hitting an all-time high. The worldwide order-book as of September 1 stands at 41 ships, with a combined value of about $26bn. Once financing and technical issues are settled on orders placed by Celebrity, Virgin, MSC and Crystal — probably within the next few months — the total will jump to 51.
