However, the German government says some of the routes aren't covered by an air transport agreement with the United Arab Emirates.\nOn Friday, Etihad won an injunction from a court in Braunschweig to protect code-sharing on Air Berlin flights to 29 destinations through Nov. 8. It said that the airlines' winter schedule starts Sunday and it couldn't wait longer for a decision whether to approve them.\nThe Transport Ministry said it was approving the code-shares through Jan. 15 to give the companies time to find a solution, news agency dpa reported.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:49:43.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
