After a very hot summer, it’s sure nice to enjoy some cooler weather. It’s sort of nice to break out some of those jackets and look forward to the crisp and cool night air. October camping is awesome in California. We still get some pretty warm days, yet the evenings cool down to where an evening campfire sure sounds inviting. What better reason to make s’mores. Camping is really nice this time of year. Once a year, we get the opportunity to go camping where Halloween is quite the experience. Many campgrounds plan so many on-site Halloween experiences, that there is no need to go anywhere else. Fun for the adults and safe for the kids, camping people and Halloween means good times for everyone. Regardless where you live in California, there are camping destinations that Halloween camping veterans and first-timers alike will enjoy. Extra special this year, is that Halloween falls on a Saturday! Folks can sleep-in on Saturday morning, enjoy the entire day, sleep in on Sunday morning, and drive home when you feel like it. Halloween camping doesn’t get any better than that. Let’s start in San Diego. Campland on the Bay has all day events for the whole family. Games such as dodgeball, horseshoes, and capture the flag are great for anyone. They have arts and craft classes, tie dye shirt classes, and a fun Halloween evening. Emerald RV Resort in Palm Desert has a pumpkin festival weekend. Pumpkin carving contests, Halloween inspired drinks for kids and adults, all are topped with a costume parade late in the afternoon. Located in Sierra Nevada foothills, Far Horizons 49er Village in Plymouth has Halloween costume and campsite competitions that everyone can join in on. Many camping areas have informal activities that Russ and Lori have thoroughly enjoyed over the years. We spent many times camping at Calico on Halloween. The town has many spooky events, some even in the evenings. The town is decorated nicely and you can discern yourself if the ghost town evening tours are fact or fiction. It is a very short drive and located less than an hour away on Interstate 15 out of Victorville. The rangers and town folks are most personable, always make you feel welcome. You can choose a hook-up site, dry site, or bring your off road toys and camp down below in the lower camping area. This is actually one of the best kept secret Halloween Trick or Treat areas. The recreational vehicles are parked close together in the lower camping area, campers all participating in Halloween evening good times. Glamis is another great Halloween camping area. Excellent riding weather, many people flock to Glamis. This is especially popular with large groups that encompass many recreational vehicles. Trick or Treat may not be as easily done there, but you should see the competition people have in decorating their RV areas! A favorite Halloween camping experience of Russ and Lori would be at Lakeside Casino and RV Park in Pahrump, Nevada. Halloween is ‘Safe Night at the Lake.’ They have a Best RV Spooktacular contest. Nearly everyone participates in the decoration of their RV and RV site. There are even cash prizes for the best three decorated sites. Campers go all out here and it is a ton of fun. The park has a BBQ that starts at 4 p.m. Hamburger and hot dog meals are $5. The anticipation of trick or treat in the park has kids and adults dressing up in their costumes far before nightfall. The fun lasts well into the night as well. Folks visit and enjoy each other’s company for a truly happy weekend. Halloween on a Saturday means take advantage of it! Choose a camping place that suits your style. There is always something for everybody’s taste. Wild or mild, the choice is yours. So, Let’s Get Rollin’!
