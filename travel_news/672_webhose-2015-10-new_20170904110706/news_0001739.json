Largely, the discussion around getting onto the property ladder focuses on the young - those who have been dubbed ' Generation Rent ' - but the growing rent crisis in the country's capital isn't only the plight of those under thirty. The latest ONS report on home ownership and renting in England and Wales found that 25 per cent of those aged between 50 and 64 were renting. And, according to property listing site SpareRoom , over the last 5 years the number of people living in flatshares between the ages of 55 and 64 has risen by 343 per cent. Additionally, the over 65s have seen a rise of over 600 per cent. For a lot of people, they have this idea that flat sharing is like something out of Friends. It's not. Almost one in ten of flatsharers who use the website are now over 45 years old, bringing the average user age of the site to nearly 29 years old. Matt Hutchinson, director of SpareRoom says flatsharing into your forties and beyond is becoming increasingly common: \"Whether we like it or not, we're being forced to rethink our aspirations of homeownership as Britain moves towards becoming a nation of renters. \"Property prices are already out of reach for many first-time buyers and increasingly, we're seeing older renters opt for house and flatshares over renting solo in one bed flats.\" Despite working for a law firm, 57-year-old Linda Thompson* has been renting since 2008 after returning from working abroad. Prior to this, she had been living in social housing and had employed flatsitters whilst she worked in Bermuda for two years After six months into her stay in the Bermuda, she was forced to give up her social housing and kick out her flatsitters: \"It wasn't a very desirable situation and I was left looking for a new place to live when I returned from working in Bermuda.\" For six months, in 2011, she moved back into her family home whilst she and her siblings attempted to sell it after the passing of her father and she has been renting ever since. Reality check: flat sharing is nothing like the popular sitcom Photo: Reuters Like many others her age, Linda is unable to rent a one bed flat alone, and has been forced into flatsharing with strangers: \"For a lot of people, they have this idea that flatsharing is like something out of Friends . It's not. \"More often than not, you're living with people who don't know each other. These people are complete strangers.\" For many, flatsharing has become almost synonymous with twenty-somethings fresh from university, which can be difficult when you're looking to move in somewhere new: \"I don't mind age,\" says Linda, \"but I do imagine people look at my age and think 'oh no, we can't live with her'.\" To get around this, often, Linda will rent out a spare room and live in the same house as her landlord or lady: \"In the end, it doesn't really bother me who I live with,\" she says, \"my main goal is to work, I don't really do anything else.\" Echoing the desperate voices of those younger than her and eager to get on the housing ladder, Linda is unable to save anything substantial whilst she rents, (\"I just work, eat, sleep and repeat\") and wonders when, or if, she'll be able to afford a place of her own one day. The size of a deposit is clearly the biggest hurdle that people face, with only 31% expecting to be able to raise the money alone John Willcock A recent survey reveals that Linda is not alone with this fear. Up to 45 per cent of people who are currently renting worry they will never be able to afford their own home, according to research from the Post Office. One in four said they doubted they would be able to save for a deposit on their current income, while a further 17 per cent feared they would lack the ability to meet monthly mortage repayments. The average age of buying your first home is increasing as well, something head of mortgages at Post Office Money, John Willcock, calls a 'worrying trend'. He said the market is moving out of reach from prospective first-time buyers: \"The average age at which non-homeowners expect to get a foot on the property ladder has increased to 36 over the past year, which is a worrying trend. \"It is clear that there is still a long way to go to inspire confidence in the first time buyers' market, with nine million feeling they won't ever be able to buy their own property.\" Potential first time buyers are being priced out of houses because of high mortgages Photo: Alamy With 'Generation Rent' handing around 50 per cent of their monthly income to landlords in the form of rent, Willcock added that saving a deposit is the \"biggest hurdle\" tenants are facing. Linda is remarkably frank about the possibility of owning a home one day: \"In London?\" she laughs, \"no way. I could hardly afford a garage in London .\" Instead, she has set her sights on the likes of South Wales or Kent with average house prices, of £160,566 and £199,314 respectively, paling in comparison to London's average of £493,026. But even then, Linda is sceptical about her chances. Critics of the housing crisis often cite the ever increasing student loan problem, and argue that it's not fair, or feasible, to expect graduates to save for a home while paying off their debt , though Linda says this isn't fair either. \"People think it's only young people who are struggling to get on the property ladder, but that's just not true. There are many women my age who are in the same situation as me. \"Debt isn't only for the young either. No matter how much I manage to save, or if any of my few investments pay off, I still wonder if I will ever be able to afford my own home with my overdraft and thousands of pounds of credit card debt.\" There are schemes to help people get on the property ladder, such as the Starter Homes Initiative , but most of them have a cut off date that renders Linda ineligible for consideration, something she thinks is a shame: \"I'm still a first time buyer, it doesn't matter how old I am.\" Campbell Robb, chief executive of housing charity Shelter , recently told The Guardian the government is not doing enough to help older tenants: “With our housing market out of control and rents sky high, it’s sadly no surprise that more and more people are finding themselves trapped in insecure flatshares well into their 40s. “Government schemes like Help to Buy are only pushing up house prices even further, and not doing anything to help those who really need it. The autumn spending review is the government’s last chance to show it is serious about solving this crisis by investing in the genuinely affordable homes we desperately need, and giving renters back the chance of a stable home.” *Names have been changed telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:47:49.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
