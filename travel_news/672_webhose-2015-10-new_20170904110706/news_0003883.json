Regent Seven Seas Cruises is the leading all-inclusive luxury cruise line, offering voyagers six-star holidays to leading worldwide destinations. Its stellar fleet currently includes three luxurious ships: Seven Seas Mariner, Seven Seas Voyager and Seven Seas Navigator. Mariner was the first all-suite, all-balcony ship launched, accommodating just 700 guests with a staff-to-guest ratio of 1 to 1.6. The ship enjoyed a generous refit last year ensuring it remains the height of contemporary luxury. Launched in 2003, Seven Seas Voyager is also an all-balcony vessel carrying 700 guests. Seven Seas Navigator, the smallest ship in the fleet (albeit 566ft long), is also the most intimate, with just 490 guests. The trio will be augmented next year by the launch of Seven Seas Explorer, the most luxurious cruise ship ever to take to the waves. The 750-guest, 56,000-ton all-suite, all-balcony ship will operate in the Mediterranean from July. The atmosphere on all vessels is elegant and refined but never stuffy. The emphasis is on high-class comfort and the benchmark is set by the quality of accommodation on offer. Even the smallest suites on board a Regent ship rival premium suites on other cruise lines. Almost all come with their own balcony, walk-in closets and en-suite facilities. The deluxe bed configurations are made with quality European linens and all furnishings are smart, comfortable and modern. There is even a personalised complimentary minibar, which is replenished daily, and a welcome bottle of champagne to toast the voyage. Life on board is as busy as you want to make it. Relax and read a book during the day or get involved in the many activities on offer. There is an open-air pool on the upper decks, a driving range and putting green, plus a well-equipped, large gym space to work off all the fantastic food or a tranquil spa for pampering sessions. At night there are the plush lounge bars to enjoy, glitzy casinos for a fun flutter, and regular, changing shows in the theatres Every ship is equipped with Wi-Fi throughout, allowing you to stay in contact with friends and family. There is a well-stocked library and if you want to be well informed about the itinerary there are regular informational talks and lectures in the theatre by experts. At night there are the plush lounge bars to enjoy, glitzy casinos for a fun flutter, and regular, changing shows in the theatres, all of which have a live house orchestra. Many cruise lines out promise five-star treatment but once on board you will find there is a surcharge for everything, and it all adds up. Regent Seven Seas Cruises provides comprehensive inclusions in the price right down to the flights, pre-cruise hotel and transfers. Importantly, Regent’s price includes unlimited shore excursions in every port of call, too. These include some truly unforgettable experiences, such as the trip on the narrow-gauge Tierra del Fuego railway on the South American tour through the national park to Lapataia Bay. On board the gourmet dining experience is all-inclusive – again with no cover charges. Dining standards on all ships are exceptional, with a wide range of choices to provide variety however long the voyage. Seven Seas Cruises’ highly praised speciality restaurants include Prime 7, which serves prime American surf-and-turf dishes, Signatures, which features fine French cuisine, and the elegantly decorated Compass Rose, the destination place to eat with a daily menu. If you need some peace and privacy, there is also 24-hour room service and in-suite dining at no extra cost. All drinks, including fine wines, premium brands and selected champagnes (bar the most superior), are included, ruling out the hassle of signing chits. And there is an absolute emphasis on outstanding service, with no gratuities asked for or accepted. While many people consider a cruise a once-in-a-lifetime experience, many Regent Seven Seas Cruises’ guests are repeat bookers – and there is no better endorsement than that. • To start planning your all-inclusive Regent cruise head to rssc.com/welcometoregent or call 02380 682280", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:29:11.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
