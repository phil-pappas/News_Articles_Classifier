The Hotelier of the Year award is the highest professional honor bestowed on a hotel and resort operation in the Caribbean, recognizing excellence in all areas of operations, as well as a commitment to training and development of staff, contributions to the community and a demonstrated commitment to sound environmental practices. The award also acknowledges each recipient’s active role in both national and regional issues affecting Caribbean tourism. \n“I would like to warmly congratulate and applaud Adam Stewart on this well-deserved and prestigious achievement,” said Minister of Tourism, The Honorable Obediah H. Wilchcombe. “Since taking the helm of Sandals nine years ago, Adam has transformed the Sandals brand and offerings, which has in turn transformed tourism and travel throughout the Caribbean and The Bahamas. He has introduced not only ‘game-changing’ developments that include the 52-acre private island, Fowl Cay Resort, here in The Bahamas but he has ensured the highest standard of quality for all the other Sandals resorts in The Bahamas. A standard that visitors not only rely on but also serves to attract them to our Islands. This alone would have been enough but Adam has been a beacon of support for the Caribbean, establishing the Sands Foundation in 2009 as well as Sandals Corporate University in 2012, both aiming to improve the lives of our Caribbean people. With all of his hard work and commitment to both Sandals and the Caribbean, Adam Stewart is without a doubt the most deserving recipient for this award. We salute him from The Bahamas and look forward to the opportunity of continuing to work with him and Sandals in The Bahamas.” \nAbout The Islands Of The Bahamas \nThe Islands Of The Bahamas have a place in the sun for everyone from Nassau and Paradise Island to Grand Bahama to The Abaco Islands, The Exuma Islands, Harbour Island, Long Island and others.
