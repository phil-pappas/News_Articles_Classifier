At this stage, there are no plans to resume commercial flights.\nThe pride of British aviation, the Concorde making its final landing in 2003. Source: News Corp Australia\nFlying at Supersonic speeds, a Concorde could fly between London and New York in a little less than three hours. In Comparison, a regular commercial flight can take around seven hours. However not many people got to experience this speed in its years in the sky. Due to limited seating capacity in the planes, ticket prices for regular economy seats were often around the same price as a first-class ticket in a standard airliner.\nThe Concordeâ€™s 27 year life came to an end in 2013 following severe financial problems. A crash in 2000 which led to the death of all on-board passengers and crew, high maintenance costs and lack of customers after 9/11 was reported as the main reason for its downfall.\nDespite the fact that we will most likely never see another commercial Concorde, companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin and even NASA are working on ways to have commercially available supersonic airliners in the air again by 2030.\nJump back to top", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/49b52715ecdd06a116b6834c9ea3aa6f", "http://www.eharmony.com.au/partner/news/?cid=116562&aid=100&utm_source=news.com.au&utm_medium=Widget&utm_campaign=Kimmy_Widget", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a41e53a7d9b8188f87dafe596068b0ed", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-21T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:19:56.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
