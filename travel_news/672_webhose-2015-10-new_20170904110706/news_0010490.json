Is The Ultimate Ocean Oasis The Huffington Post B.C. ADVERTISEMENT \nAn entire island has gone up for sale in B.C., and it's a beauty. \nWhitestone Island , a six-acre estate that lies about half an hour from Vancouver by private boat or sea plane, hit the market in September. \nNestled on the Sunshine Coast , the place takes full advantage of its surroundings. \nAn open-plan, 2,500 sq.-ft. home is perched on one of the island's rocky outcrops, with massive windows offering a near-panoramic view of the ocean, according to its listing . \nBoasting four bedrooms and three bathrooms, the secluded $3.8-million house has a West Coast feel with wooden beams throughout. \nThe master bedroom takes up an entire floor all on its own, and the ensuite bathtub overlooks the big blue sea. (Because, of course.) \nAnd if looking out at the stunning view through all those windows isn't enough, there's a sprawling wooden patio you could lounge on to your heart's content. ( Watch video above .) \nAs a bonus, whale sightings are common in the area, and chameleons, sea otters, harp seals would be your neighbours. \nThere's even a pair of bald eagles to share the island with. \nNot bad at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:41:28.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
