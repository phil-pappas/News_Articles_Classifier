It's time to take stock. \nHere are 11 things to do this fall to get your travel affairs in order: \n1. If you do not have a passport, get one. You may have no plans to go anywhere, ever. But I believe all dreams are possible to those who are prepared. If in the next 10 years someone offers you a sudden chance to fly to Paris or Tokyo or the Taj Mahal or even Toronto, you will be ready. See passports.govt.nz . 2. If you have a passport, check the expiration date . Most nations require that the expiration date of your passport be at least six months beyond the date you return home from visiting. If your passport has less than nine months left before it expires and you are planning an international trip, get a new one now. 3. Check accumulated points for each of your airline and hotel loyalty programs. You may have points or perks you didn't even realise you had. Make sure the points are not in danger of expiring. Also, check for points you have amassed on credit cards that offer travel perks. Do you have enough for a free airline ticket or hotel room? If so, use them. Make a list of what you've got so you do not forget and let the points slip away. I do this check four times a year to stay current. 4. Sign up for the loyalty program for any airline, car rental, cruise line or hotel you use or may use. I am never sure why people don't join, because they are free and they come with beneficial perks even to basic members. One of the best perks? The ability to skip long lines at airport car rental counters and go straight to your reserved vehicle. \nThe Grand Canyon - still on your bucket list or can you give this one a miss? \n5. Check to see whether you have any airline companion e-certificates or e-credits you may have forgotten about. \nIf you do, double-check their expiration dates and rules. Many people forget they have them, but a companion certificate can be worth up to hundreds of dollars. \n6. Compile a printed list of all of your travel loyalty programs, including account numbers, log-ins and passwords. \nKeep it somewhere safe at your house. It is fine also to keep travel loyalty account numbers on a list in your phone as long as you don't include the log-in information. \n7. Examine the state of your suitcase. \nAre the wheels shot, does the handle stick, or is the zipper busted? You absolutely have to get a new one. You will be amazed at the good prices and how light new luggage is. Once you buy a new bag, personalise it with a ribbon or unique luggage tag. \n8. Update your bucket list. Ad Feedback \nAre the places you have dreamed of seeing still relevant? Do you still absolutely have to see the Grand Canyon or Antarctica in your lifetime? Contemplate, review and boil down your bucket list to five places or fewer and make plans to visit at least one of them next year. \n9. Install the latest travel apps on your phone. \nInstall apps for all airlines, hotels and car rental companies you use (and store log-ins so the app recognises you.) Some apps for checking flights and fares include: Hopper, ITA Software, Kayak and Flight Aware. \n10. Choose your three favourite travel photos from this year. \nDon't just store a tonne of photos on your phone or laptop to be forgotten and lost in the haze of time. Pick three. Print them out. Put them up next to your desk. As the dark gloom of winter descends you can recall those happy times and start planning your trips for next year. \n11. Start planning your trips for next year. \nDon't just dream. Do it. \nTNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:10:31.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
