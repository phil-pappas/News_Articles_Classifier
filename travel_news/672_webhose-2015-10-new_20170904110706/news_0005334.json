As of Saturday morning, Patricia is a tropical storm. \nFurther weakening will reduce Patricia to a tropical rainstorm later on Saturday, but the danger of life-threatening flooding will once again expand and worsen across Texas and Louisiana in the United States as Patricia's moisture and a piece of its energy surges northward. \nPatricia made landfall at approximately 6:15 p.m. CDT on Friday along the coast of southwestern Mexico near Cuixmala, Mexico, around 55 miles west-northwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, as a Category 5 hurricane. \nMaximum-sustained winds were estimated to be 270 km/h (165 mph), making Patricia only the second Category 5 hurricane to originate in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and make landfall in Mexico. The other was an unnamed hurricane in 1959 that also made landfall near Manzanillo. \nEarlier Friday, Patricia became the strongest hurricane on record, passing both Linda in the eastern Pacific and Wilma in the Atlantic. \nDespite the catastrophic force that Patricia slammed onshore with, the Associated Press reports there is no word of deaths or major damage as of early Saturday morning. There are early reports of some flooding and landslides. \n\"The first reports confirm that the damage has been less than those expected from a hurricane of this magnitude,\" President Enrique Pena Nieto said in a taped address late Friday according to the Associated Press. \nThe worst of the dangerous hurricane bypassed the major cities of Manzanillo, Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara. \nWidespread tree damage and waves crashing into resort hotels were reported in Barra de Navidad, located just south of where Patricia came onshore. \nAs crews further assess the damage from Patricia in southwestern Mexico, there will be lingering showers and thunderstorms around this weekend. \nAfter some initial lingering rain from Patricia Saturday morning, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Rob Miller expects \"popup shower and thunderstorm activity in the afternoon and evening hours the rest of this weekend with Saturday night being dry.\" \nSeas are still rough for swimmers and small craft but will gradually subside as the weekend progresses. \nFarther to the north near Patricia's center, localized flooding downpours with rainfall totals of 25-50 mm (1-2 inches) will continue to spread from central Mexico to the northeastern part of the country. This includes around Saltillo and Monterrey. \nMexican communities near the Texas border will face heavier rain and a greater threat for flooding into early Saturday night as moisture from Patricia surges northward and interacts with another developing storm system. \nRainfall will generally be on the order of 75-150 mm (3-6 inches), including in the cities of Piedras Negras and Reynosa. \nAs the new system pulls to the northeast, drier air will sweep into northeastern Mexico to end the weekend. \nPatricia became the strongest hurricane on record on Friday morning. The estimated central pressure of Patricia dropped to 879 mb, breaking the record of 894 mb from Hurricane Linda in the eastern Pacific set in 1997 and also surpassing the 882 mb pressure of Hurricane Wilma in the Atlantic from 2005. \nThe maximum sustained winds of 200 mph (160 knots) breaks the previous wind speed record of 185 mph (160 knots) from Linda and Wilma for the strongest surface winds ever in the area of responsibility of the National Hurricane Center. \nWhile Patricia is the strongest hurricane and tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, Typhoon Tip and several other Western Pacific typhoons obtained a lower central pressure.
