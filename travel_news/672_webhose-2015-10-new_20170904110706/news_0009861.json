(Universal Orlando Resort)\n’Tis the season when theme parks become scream parks whose sole purpose is to scare the bejeezus out of us. And there is no ticket more coveted than Universal Orlando’s Halloween Horror Nights , which draws hundreds of thousands from around the world, consistently breaks its own attendance records and is celebrating its 25 th anniversary this year.\n“We’ve heard a lot about it and wanted to come for a long time,” said Oliver Fogg of Sheffield, England, who attended the event last week with his girlfriend, Chloe Thomas. “This is one of the main things of our holiday in the U.S.”\n“We’re really looking forward to it,” Thomas said as they waited to enter Universal Studios Florida. “I had a friend who came another year and she said the whole thing was absolutely petrifying.”\n“Some people love ghosts. For other people, it’s slashers. Some people are deathly afraid of clowns. We always want to make sure we cover all the bases.\"\nWhat separates Halloween Horror Nights from other same-themed events is its combination of hallmark original characters — most notably the demonic master of ceremonies, Jack the Clown — and its high-quality haunted houses, many of which are themed to franchises like “Nightmare on Elm Street,” “Friday the 13th,” “Insidious” and “The Walking Dead.”\nFrom their chilling sound effects and hideous creatures to their visual tricks and realistic props, these dark, labyrinthine houses use every trick in the book to make you jump. Just strolling through the streets of the park puts you in a shadowy scare zone filled with roaming “scareactors” depicting chainsaw-wielding clowns and asylum escapees. And no two seasons are ever the same. There’s a new lineup of haunted houses and live shows every year.\nMore on this...
