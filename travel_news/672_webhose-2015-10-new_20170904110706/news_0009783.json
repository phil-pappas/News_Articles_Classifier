Robert Redford starring in The Horse Whisperer Photo: Channel 5 Television Monty Roberts was the inspiration for the 1998 Hollywood film The Horse Whisperer and has been consulting the Queen on her horses and corgis for a quarter of a century. Mr Roberts, 80, who is renowned for his taming of wild animals, said he regularly meets the monarch to discuss all things equine. Queen Elizabeth II presenting a prize at the Royal Windsor Show in the Seventies Photo: Rex His comments about the Queen’s support came after he had staged a demonstration of his skills for supporters of the animal welfare charity the Brooke, which provides help for working horses, donkeys and mules in some of the world’s poorest communities. The Queen made a surprise visit to the performance, at the Royal Mews, Buckingham Palace, in support of the organisation. The Duchess of Cornwall is patron of the charity and hosted the event, and the Queen sat in the front row. Mr Roberts has become a worldwide star thanks to his innovative techniques with horses. He has been staying at the Queen’s private Sandringham home working with her animals. The Queen's riding custom had prompted staff at Windsor Castle to joke that \"the only thing that comes between the Queen and her heir is a Hermes scarf\" Photo: REX FEATURES This year he became a global ambassador for the Brooke. Speaking about the effect the Queen has had on his life, Mr Roberts said: “If she hadn’t pushed me, I’d be a cowboy in California doing parochial stuff.” He described how he first met the monarch: “She sent a man over to California – I thought it was a joke. They brought me to Windsor Castle in April of 1989. “If she hadn’t pushed me, I’d be a cowboy in California doing parochial stuff\" Monty Roberts “Her Majesty had 23 horses ready for me to work with and it was one week with Her Majesty there every day, when it was only supposed to be one hour. “She said there had to be a book and she sent me to 21 cities in 30 days because she wanted this message out there. \"Every year, two, three, four times a year that we get together, we discuss what’s happened, we discuss what we want to do.” Photo: THE ROYAL COLLECTION After his display of horse taming, guests were invited to a reception to meet the star of the entertainment. Mr Roberts has also revealed this year that the Queen has stopped breeding Pembrokeshire Welsh Corgies because she does not want to leave any behind when she dies. “She didn’t want to leave any young dog behind,” he told Vanity Fair. “She wanted to put an end to it.” The Queen, 89, who has owned 30 corgis over the years, now has just two, Holly and Willow. Both are almost 12 and unlikely to live much longer. • The Queen’s favourite horses: in pictures She fell in love with the breed as a child, naming her first one Dookie. She is said to feed them herself and take them on daily walks. “My corgis are my family,” she has said. But of all of her dogs, it is Monty –named after her trusted adviser – who won the nation’s heart with his memorable performance at the Olympics opening ceremony in 2012. Along with two other corgis, Monty greeted James Bond and delivered him to the Queen, before performing tummy-rolling for the camera. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:47:59.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
