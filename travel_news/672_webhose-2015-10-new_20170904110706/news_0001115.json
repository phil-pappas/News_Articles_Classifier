And one of Asia’s best spots to watch these birds is the 500-metre-high mountain Khao Dinsor in Pathiu district of Chumphon. \nDuring this time of year, an American freelance researcher who has studied the migratory routes of raptors around the world, such as in Costa Rica, Israel, Spain, the US and Mexico, comes to Thailand to observe the birds’ migration at the hill in tambon Bangson. \nRobert DeCandido, known as Bob, in his 50s, insists Khao Dinsor is one of Asia’s best spots to watch migratory raptors. \nThe others are Tanjung Tuan, an exclave of the Strait of Malacca, Malaysia, and the Bali Barat National Park in Bali, Indonesia. \nBob, who also works as a freelance bird watching guide in public parks in the US and other countries, rents a small house at the foot of Khao Dinsor for bird sighting. \nHe gets up early in the morning to prepare camera gear and food before walking up the hill to observe the birds with the help of a local porter who helps carry his equipment. \nHe walks up about two kilometres to the bird observation spot, sometimes before sunrise. He spends the whole day on the hill observing and taking pictures of the birds. \nBob has been bird watching at Khao Dinsor for more than 10 years, and he is no stranger to the local villagers. \n“Every time he sees birds, he walks quietly with a hunched back and his movements do not make the birds fly away,” a villager said of Bob when he is trying to catch a glimpse of the migratory birds. \nHis bird photos are uploaded onto his website and his Facebook page. \nSome of the photos he took last year at Khao Dinsor have been printed out by many bird watchers for reference when they look for birds there. \nBob has accumulated vast knowledge about the migratory raptors and is believed to possess one of the largest collections of Khao Dinsor bird photos. \nFew people watch birds for a living. Many local watchers have full-time jobs, such as university teaching, and bird sighting is a past-time or a recreation. \nFrom his experience, Bob says climate conditions play a major part in the migration routes of raptors. \nDuring the southwest monsoon season, particularly during September, raptors usually fly high over the mountains, far from the sea to avoid warm air below. \nWhen the northeast monsoon approaches around November, raptors tend to fly low, near the sea particularly in the early morning. \nIdeally, pictures of flying raptors are best captured in the early morning, when they fly low and soft rays of sunlight gleam on their feathered backs, Bob says. \nUnder the fierce hot sun, raptors tend to fly higher and photographers cannot catch their colours so clearly, or the natural features and characteristics of the birds, he said. \nAbout 200,000 raptors made their journey through Khao Dinsor between September and November last year, according to an estimate by Bob and other bird watchers. The number was close to that of the year earlier. \nAccording to Bob’s 11-year research, about 40 types of raptors were found to have flown through the area. Some are rare, such as the Greater Eagle — which was only spotted in October last year. \nThis has changed the bird watchers’ earlier belief that the Strait of Malacca was the best spot in the Southeast Asia to observe migratory raptors. \nOnly certain types of raptors fly through the Strait, such as the Grey-faced Buzzard, which migrate in large flocks. \nThe country of Jordan is one of the best locations to watch migratory raptors in the Middle East, but it is no match for Khao Dinsor in terms of rare birds, according to Bob. On Khao Dinsor, the best photo-shooting spot for migratory raptors is about 350 metres above sea level. \nThe area — which is close to a cliff on the western front of the hill — allows the photographers to take snapshots of the raptors from a higher position, showing the colour of their backs clearly against the backdrop of the breathtaking scenery of the surrounding sea and mountains. \nThe photographers can sometimes take photographs of raptors at eye level, allowing them to clearly observe the movements of the birds in flight. \nSome experienced observers can even distinguish the gender of the birds when they are flying. \nChukiat Nualsri, a coordinator of the Khao Dinsor nature study centre, said based on his experience of observing migratory raptors for more than a decade, he can estimate the timing of the birds’ migration to Chumphon. \nKhao Dinsor has been promoted on the country’s tourism map as a natural attraction. \nHe said the 9th Asian Raptor Research and Conservation Network (ARRCN) Symposium, which is being held for the first time in Thailand, is a significant event where bird watchers from around the world gather and share their ideas and experiences. \nThe symposium began on Wednesday in Chumphon’s Muang district and wraps up tomorrow. \nThe event has drawn more than 200 academics and participants from more than 20 countries, according to Kaset Sutasha, secretary of the event. \nDuring the forum, participants take excursions to observe migratory raptors at Khao Dinsor. \nMr Kaset said the symposium was organised this year with the expectation that an unprecedented number of participants, both Thai and foreign, would attend. \nThe past eight conferences, all held in other countries, also succeeded in gathering bird watchers, students and people who watch birds as a hobby, he added. \nMeanwhile, Witchayanan Limrungpatanakij, of the Flyway Foundation, a non-profit institute which supports programmes for wildlife conservation including funding projects for research about migratory species, revealed the top 10 species of migratory birds in terms of flocking numbers which have made Khao Dinsor their temporary home from September this year. \nThe list consists of the Pacific Swift, the Barn Swallow, Japanese Sparrowhawk, Blue-tailed Bee-eater, Blue-throated Bee-eater, Forest Wagtail, White-throated Needletail, Chestnut-headed Bee-eater, Asian House Martin and Oriental Honey-buzzard. \nBob aims his camera at the raptors inflight. Many avid bird watchers go to Khao Dinsor to capture photographs of the various species of migratory birds there.Amnart Thongdee \nA rare bird of prey perching on a tree is captured in a photo by Mr DeCandido, also known as Bob.Robert DeCandido \nMigratory raptors are a common sight as they flock together and fly over Khao Dinsor mountain in Pathiu district of Chumphon.Robert DeCandido \nRobert DeCandido, an American freelance researcher who has studied the migratory routes of raptors around the world.Amnart Thongdee \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
