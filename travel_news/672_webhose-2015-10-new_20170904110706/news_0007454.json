Smarter.\" campaign. \"City. Smarter.\" will showcase a smart, urban lifestyle, highlighting a sophisticated, sustainable, easy-access neighborhood with office buildings that feature highly competitive rents and building floor plans that allow organizations to maximize their rental dollars while creating modern, collaborative workspaces.\nNoMa has become a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood within walking distance from the U.S. Capitol that has attracted savvy businesses, highly-skilled workers, city-sophisticated residents and great retail. Its central location provides close access to two red line Metro stations, the Union Station transportation hub for the Amtrak, MARC and VRE trains, and major highways, Route 50 and I-395. It is also a \"walker's paradise\" with a walkscore of 92 from Walkscore.com and bike-friendly, with eight Capital Bikeshare stations, the city's only separated cycle track and the Metropolitan Branch Trail. NoMa is the easiest neighborhood in the district from which to get around and out of town.\n\"More than ever, businesses and organizations are focused on attracting and retaining a great workforce. What's important to today's workers, though, is quality of life. They demand the opportunity to live a sustainable lifestyle and they crave flexibility. NoMa, with its easy access, sophisticated housing choices, green office buildings and destination retail, has it all,\" said Robin-Eve Jasper , president of the NoMa BID. \"From great new public spaces to our internationally renowned approach to transit-oriented development, NoMa has been committed from day one to being a sustainable community.\"\nTwenty two of the office buildings in NoMa are LEED certified and have green roofs, great natural light, flexible floor plans and a wide variety of sustainable features. \"NoMa is a true 21 st century neighborhood and offers a wealth of opportunities for businesses,\" said Jasper. \"People who already work and live here love the neighborhood and are excited that it is continuing to grow and add attractions, such as movie theaters, parks, public art, new restaurants and great shopping.\"\nSince the early 2000's, NoMa has undergone massive redevelopment and revitalization. The neighborhood, previously known for its warehouses and surface parking lots, now hosts over 13,000,000 square feet (SF) of office space, over 360,000 SF of retail space and 4,803 new apartment units. NoMa is home to many businesses, associations, nonprofits and government agencies including: NPR, Google, CNN, the American Medical Association, World Resources Institute, Department of Justice, Mathematica Policy Research and NoMa Workspaces.\nNoMa is also quickly becoming a hot neighborhood to live in with more than 30,000 people in the neighborhood, including 6,300 people in new residential buildings that are chock full of amenities including swimming pools, gyms, dog parks, theatres and communal entertainment space.\nThe \"City. Smarter.\" campaign will feature curated NoMa tours to showcase the neighborhood; thought leadership events; and an outreach effort designed to raise awareness of NoMa, urban living and the importance of location in attracting the strongest workforce.\nAbout NoMa\nNoMa is a vibrant, growing neighborhood nestled among Union Station, the U.S. Capitol, Shaw, and the H Street, NE corridor in Washington, D.C.
