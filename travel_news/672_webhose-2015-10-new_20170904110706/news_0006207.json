(Today, one US dollar was equivalent to RM4.17). \nMirza spoke at a news conference after the launch of the 'Dekat Je Bersama ETS' (It's Close with ETS) tour package and 'Perlis Dekat Je' (Perlis is Close) briefing for the media and tourism industry players here. \nEight representatives of tour agents, 10 media representatives, two representatives of travel associations and two tourism product entrepreneurs were specially brought by Tourism Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur on the ETS (Electric Train Service). Five representatives of tour agents from the Satun Province in southern Thailand also attended the events. \nThe journalists and tourism industry players were taken on a tour of attractions in Perlis, among them Gua Kelam, Padang Besar Business Arcade, Snake and Reptile Farm, Herbal Forest and Dataran Terinai. \nMirza said domestic tourism last year registered an increase to 60.7 million people who spent RM41.4 billion, up from 54.4 million who spent RM35.6 billion in 2013. \n\"We find that tour operators played a role in encouraging their clients to visit Malaysia. Therefore, this programme is being held today so that they can see for themselves the attractions in Perlis. \n\"Our advantage is the 3S - scenic, safe, story. However, the local people must know how to convey a story as this will draw the interest of foreign tourists,\" he said. \nMirza said Tourism Malaysia made available '1001 Packages', which were inexpensive tour packages. \nHe said over 81,000 packages valued at more than RM23 million were sold in 2014 and 31,588 packages valued at RM10.4 million were sold between January and September this year. \nOn cooperation with Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad, Mirza said the Electric Train Service (ETS) had an impact on the tourism industry because it provided a safer, organised and inexpensive trip. He said Malaysia's domestic tourism target for 2020 was 81.4 million people who were expected to spend about RM55.4 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:33:47.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
