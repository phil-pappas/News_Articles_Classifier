It’s wrong to kill an iconic animal like that,” said Johnny Rodrigues, chairman for Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, adding the the elephant’s tusks weighed 54 kilograms. \n“The last time one was seen [of such size] was more than 40 years ago. The hunter should not have shot it.” \nIn July, American dentist Walter Palmer incensed animal rights activists worldwide when he shot and killed Cecil the lion with a powerful bow and arrow. \nCecil was a well-known attraction among visitors to the Hwange National Park and was wearing a tracking collar as part of an Oxford University research project. \nZimbabwe abandoned its bid to press charges against Palmer, saying his papers “were in order” and that he did not know he was committing any offence. \nThe Zimbabwean Parks department recently vowed to increase patrols after at least 26 elephants were poisoned to death by poachers in separate incidents over the past month.Speech", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:57:06.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
