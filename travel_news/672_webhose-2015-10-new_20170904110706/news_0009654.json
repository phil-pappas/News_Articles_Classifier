All 16 finalists are winners in being able to play a golf course like this, and with everything else Old Mutual Wealth has brought to the event. One American golfer wrote in the visitors’ book that Old Head is like “Pebble Beach on steroids”. He’s right. It is an extraordinary golf course, with sea views on every hole. You could not find a better stage for this competition. Events like this are great for the game, proven by the fact that 25,000 golfers participated. The 16 finalists have all enjoyed being treated as if they are playing on tour, thanks to the quality of the course, hospitality and caddies. The caddies even wore bibs with the golfers’ names on. I enjoyed meeting the finalists and sharing a few stories about the Ryder Cup. There were some good scores in the final and some high numbers, too, on some holes – but that’s golf. I know one thing: I will never forget the first time I set eyes on Old Head.
