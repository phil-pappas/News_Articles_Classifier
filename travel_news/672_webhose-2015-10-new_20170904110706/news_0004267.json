The new service will serve daily flight starting from October 11, 2015 onwards. \nMr. Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth, President of Bangkok Airways PCL said “Bangkok Airways foresees the potential of Phuket and Hat Yai as prominent destinations of leisure and business. Phuket is recognized as one of the world’s most famous tourist attractions where millions of travelers from all over the world have visited. Hat Yai is a major commercial city of Southern Thailand and a gateway to Malaysia and Singapore. This new service between Phuket and Hat Yai will certainly enhance the growth of tourism and economy due to the convenience and ease of travel. \n“Bangkok Airways currently operates several routes between Phuket and Thailand’s most popular destinations such as Phuket-Bangkok (8 flights daily), Phuket-Chiang Mai (1 flight daily), Phuket-Samui (4 flights daily) and Phuket-U-tapao (Pattaya) (1 flight daily). This new direct route will certainly offer a greater choice to our passengers in Hat Yai to be able to connect to Phuket and to other destinations within Bangkok Airways network, which ultimately will drive the tourism industry in both ends,” Mr. Puttipong added. \nBangkok Airways will serve daily flight between Phuket and Hat Yai, operated by ATR72-500/600 which consists of 70 economy class seats.
