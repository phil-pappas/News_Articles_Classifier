All thanks to my dad who made this plan. The bookings of hotels, vehicles were taken care. We (actually I) wanted someone as guide who is patient enough to answer every quest raised, good in English/ hindi and most importantly have a wide knowledge about the trip. That was because I dont like a blind trip but to know what it is and why it is. We called the person (Mr. Vinod).whom we booked for our Valparai trip (that will hit IM portal shortly, tried one before but did not work out, will go for another one). We got his contact from Mr. Patnayaks blog on Bangalore- Valparai trip. (Thank you Mr. Patnayak, you were right, he was really reliable). So, this time Mr. Nirmal (08682947494) booked a Qualis for us for the whole trip with a driver Mr. Vinod (his number 08281573822). Our journey started by Kerala Express at New Delhi station. The way to New Delhi to Ernakulam is so much scenic. There were many tunnels, falls, hills and etc. After a long two days journey we reached Ernakulam Junction. At Ernakulam junction our cab was waiting for us we had booked through a travel agency. I must say about the person. He was tall, wheatish and pucca malayali with big moustache. He gave a big grin. He greeted us in hindi (oh Gosh, he could speak good hindi and english). Problem of language solved. You know we can tell about a person if he could speak the language or not just by his initial conversation which usually involve greeting and asking whereabouts. My dad talked to him something while I gave the place a glance. There were auto rickshaws, taxis, cycles, motor bikes all loaded with Malayalis. After loading the dickie (trunk) with our luggage, our driver took us to our destination, Munnar. The route gave the most scenic view. Our cameras were rolling all the way. We captured and shot every moment. The road was wet though. We first travelled through the habitats and then to a deep forest. There were many plantations of rubber, cardamom, coconut etc. It was fun watching all those (when you live in a city like Delhi). Munnar, though part of Kerala gives an essence of new world in itself. The whole place is green (tea estates) and blue/ black (sky). The Sun was very much keen in not showing up. There were many tea estates (each have their own tea factory) each owned by different people, most of which owned by Tata. The time was the one thing that we cant measure, unless we see our watch and realize that time is running fast. It was pre noon time when we reached Munnar. It is a beautiful city. You can just experience the nature not just see. it was drizzling. We felt little cold. But, we enjoyed the weather. We straight away went to our hotel- Hotel C7. A good hotel with an amazing view. We could see the tea plantations all over from our room. After lunch we came to our rooms for rest and decided to do sightseeing from the next day as we were very tired due to long journeys. It was a pleasant and chill morning. We all were excited to explore the beauty of Munnar. After a healthy breakfast of bread toast and fruit juice (we also bought some snacks and soft drinks for the travels) we came to the parking where our driver was already waiting for us. First we went to Mattupetty dam. The nearest place from our hotel. But, driving to the place was amazing with all the lefts and right turns we took to reach the place. Until we reach the place, one couldnt tell where we are going. Due to the rains there was lot of trees, wild flowers, tropical plants at one side and the other side there was tea estates. It feels your eyes with such a tender. We reached Mattupetty dam. It was drizzling so not a good idea to go near the bank. So, we remained inside for some time and then, got out to give a glimpse of the dam. The water was greenish. It had stopped raining. But, the place was chill. People were carrying umbrellas, ironically we dint. We saw some ponies and horses were standing at the dam. Those were for riding when it is not raining. We skipped it though. We returned to our vehicle. There were lots of vehicle parked alongside which we made our vehicle to move. somehow we were again on the main road aiming Echo point. All the way we saw the plant of Lantana Camara flower and lot of ferns. Those were looking very beautiful. The air exposed the fragrance of lantana a little. We hoped not to rain. As, there was boating facility at Echo point and we wanted to do that one. Again after some lefts and rights turn we reached Echo point. there were many vehicles. Lots of people. An aisle of shops busy with tourists. We went near to the bank and as it is called echo point, we started screaming to check it. And yeah.. it echoes back. It was great and we felt good hearing back our own voices (though it sounded weird). Thank God, it wasnt raining. We approached the ticket counter for boating. They said only pedal boat is available. That was ok. We just needed the boating part. We were happy. We took three pedal boats as we were six people including the driver (who joined us after lot of compulsion). The water was green though, it reflected the trees at the bank. Looked amazing. there came sun, but dominated by clouds. We pedalled through the lake with trees both side. With 1 hour pedalling we banked. Ohh.. so it had came to an end.. so soon. When our driver told us there is Kundala lake ahead. We drove to Kundala lake. I loved the serene view the place gave us. the tea estates though were everywhere, you will not find bored to see those. Some were green, some were dark green, some were so much dark that they looked black from far. I liked the terrace farming here. All we are witnessing in real which we used to see in televisions and photos. I have already started loving the place. The thing I loved most was the smell of eucalyptus that filed the entire air that opened our nostrils. Its a great deal with nature. We blended with it. Kundala lake, another nice place filled with silence. After walking and going through the shops there, we went down to lake. We spend some time there at the bank then,we drove forward. Most of the time we were amidst forest. Driving through Ellapatti, wavy and narrow roads, ups and downs, we reached Top station. The sky was blue here.. With some fruit shops, a pathway that led us to the ticket counter. A board with Top Station view point welcomed us. It also said Indians Rs. 25. So, we paid Rs. 25 for each. We had to walk down to a little steep way, with mountains covered with clouds and valley at both sides. It was breath taking view. We felt the chill breeze, though there was sun on the top. We walked to the peak and the end. My dad and mom struggled walking but, we youngsters did not feel that much tired and enjoyed the whole scene. Once we reached the end point, we saw the whole paradise in front of us. there was the majestic range of hills which were covered with clouds and valley of flowers. It was exciting and thrilling. A life time experience. we opened our hands wide and closed our eyes to feel the whole thing. It was little scary too. We captured everything in our camera and in our eyes, minds and hearts. We bought some fruits from the fruit shops at the entrance. The lady who was selling the fruit was very friendly (her name was Shanthi, I guess). We bought passion fruits from her. Then, next shop. Again a lady, we bought cold drink and custard apples from her (her name was Bharaniamma). Both ladies were good in talking and behaving. They can sell anything. When we were returning back we saw Periyar Residency, where we had our lunch. At the backyard there was a place to sit from where you can see sea of trees and the mountain ranges. Beautiful experience. We wanted to stay there, but, advised by our driver to come back soon as there is another place he wanted to show us. Now, he had become a part of the journey and family, with his loyalty, genuinity, meekness and smiling character. He was a package of whole thing that we expected. He literally answered every question (that means every single question...) we rose to him. Totally knowledgeable and humble. So, as HE wanted to show us, we agreed to go. We drove through a dense forest from here. It was Pampadulam Shola National Park. The way was really really covered with dense forest. It was chill and dark (due to the trees). After a small drive, we reached an open land (though there was forest at one side). The place was Vattavada. A small hill village. This is what our driver wanted to show us. we were pleased. Didnt I tell you before, he understood us very well. We saw a beans farm. We wanted to get into the farm and see the whole. There was a farmer who allowed us to get into his beans farm. We felt good. We were in the middle of a hill farm. We saw the beans, they were very fresh. We were just coming back from the beans farm, when a small boy ran to us. An about 4 feet little boy said he will show us his strawberry farm. We were happy. Not only for that we will see the strawberry farm but also for the kid, who offered us to show his farm. So, he led us. The boy talked with so much maturity. When asking for what he was doing, he said hes studying 9th. What... a 9th class. He looked smaller than that. Like a said before, he was a kid. So, that was reason for the kind of maturity. He gave a full tour of his farm. The strawberries were at its early stage. Then, there was cabbage. They were big ones. Fully grown one and ready to be sold. Then the boy brought someone. The man was his father. He started talking to us. He showed us how to pluck strawberries. He then, gave us fresh strawberry wine to drink. It was without alcohol. We bought some strawberries and a bottle of wine from him. After spending some great time in the farm and with the little, grown kid we returned back to our vehicle (of course thanking the kid and handed over some money to his father for his studies, he first denied but accepted when compelled). The first thing we did was thanking the driver. He just smiled. It was evening and there were little beam of lights in the dusking sky. We drove to the hotel back. The tea estates looked beautiful even in dark. We reached our hotel. All were tired and in need of rest. After our dinner we rushed to our room and jumped on our beds. We couched on the bed with each other. The following day we woke up on the sunrise. The rays were soothing to our relief. We got ready drove towards Pothamedu view point. It was just 5 kms from our hotel. the view through all the way was breathtakingly amazing. we kept staring outside. When we reached we saw the place was fully covered by mist. From the point or the end we could only see the white clouds covering the whole place. It is an amazing feeling when you know that you are standing above clouds. That is why it is called the Paradise and one of the most popular tourist destinations in Munnar. We spent some time there until mu uncle felt very cold and couldnt stay there for any longer. Then we proceeded to Attukkad waterfalls. This waterfall, which flowed from a high mountain, looked beautiful when it hit the earth. The sound of the waters thrilled us and made us to go near but, we were warned by our father so stayed back. We did not go near the stream but stayed at a safer distance just to give a good look to it. Though we stood at a distance, the drizzle splashed on us. it gave goose bumps. We came back to hotel from Attukad. We had our lunch which was already delayed and we all were dead hungry. At evening we just wished to go some near place around our hotel. Kannan Devan Hills Plantation Company. It was a sales outlet. There were many kinds/flavours of tea packed in different quantities. Chocolate, Elaichi, Masala, Green, Ginger, Premium, Black tea were some I could recollect. We bought 1 kg packet with 6 flavours in one. There was a board named chocolate factory. So, we went to it. It was little away from KDHPC. We went inside. It was a chocolate shop. The sales person gave a briefing/ demo on chocolate making. It was tempting. we listened to the demonstration very carefully (the most interesting thing ever). There were many kinds of chocolates. Trust me, this is the first time I saw raw milk and dark chocolates, without a wrapper. It WAS tempting. your every single nerve will push you to buy chocolates of each flavour or type (like milk, dark, elaichi, orange pulp, pineapple pulp, honey, dry fruits: badam, pista.., coconut milk, mango delight, etc etc.. Rs.1000/kg) and its your mind which says beta paise kum hain or kya karoge in sab ka. We anyhow settled with three types of chocolates: White chocolate (just milk), dark chocolate and fruit & nut. We then headed back to our hotel. The next day we planned to go to tea museum first (it was very near to our hotel) and then Eravikulam National park. But, our driver told by the time we reach Eravikulam it will be much crowded and we would have to wait for hours just to get tickets. So, we planned to head towards Eravikulam National Park first then to tea museum. We were told this national park was the abode of Nilgiri Tahrs, a rare species of wild goat. We also heard that if we have luck we can spot elephants and wild big cats like leopard, tiger, and other animals like: golden jackals, mongooses etc. So, we were looking forward for the trip around the national park. One cannot assume what he can come across in national park. So, our journey towards Eravikulam started. We reached Eravikulam by 8.30. There was a queue at the entrance for buying tickets. We joined them. Our private vehicle was not allowed inside. So, after buying the tickets we had to wait for a while for the forest safari bus to arrive. We waited nearly for half an hour. A forest safari van came to get us to the national park. The safari van dropped us near the top of the mountain. From there we had to walk to rest of the places which is about 2 kms around the mountain to get a close experience with nature. We reached the top point with a struggling walk. There was a sitting area that we were very pleased to see. We sat there and in front of us was the whole range of mountains with plantations covering those. It looked beautiful. The best place for nature lovers. Then, we saw some Tahrs around (for which we were there). we took pictures of that. They tried nearing us but hopped away into the valley because of the noise made by some children there. Then, the security staff advised all of us to remain silent. After a small walk from there, we saw strings and many many species of flora. There was a jackal at a far distance, which we did notice only when our guide showed us. we zoomed our camera to have a closer look. The sun was soaring and shining high. So, we returned to place where were dropped. Where after some time our van arrived to take us back. The next destination was tea museum. On the way we halted to have lunch. Lunch was purely south Indian. It was meals with rice, sambhar, rasam and curd with some extra appetizers. With the heavy lunch we headed to Tata Tea museum. Tata tea museum was established by Tata Company as an information desk about the growth of tea plantations in Kerala mainly in Munnar. it also showcased the machineries and technology used in tea processing. There was session on tea-tasting which was interesting to watch. There were varieties of tea displayed this session. It was a different experience at Tea museum which was totally a new one for us. We saw some foreigners too who were very keen in knowing the nuances in tea processing and the growth of the industry. By evening we were back to our hotel and to get ready for the return journey with saying a good bye to Munnar that gave us a new experience. NB: I'm working on my next blog on Shopping in Munnar.. Wait for it.. will hit soon..
