To walk into a church or chapel, a cathedral or an abbey to find the air rich with the fragrance of fruit and earthy vegetables fills me with pride and relief. Golden sheaves, plump marrows, pyramids of apples and even, in urban places of worship, tins of beans and cellophane-wrapped loaves of bread remind us of why we should be grateful for the bounty of the land: “All is safely gathered in, ’ere the winter storms begin.” Hallowe’en? Bah, humbug! I was brought up a churchgoer – I was a choirboy from the age of eight and then a bell ringer – and I have also earned my living from the land, so it is not surprising that, for me, the harvest has a special resonance. But it should strike a chord with anyone who respects the earth. Children tuck into a cornucopia of fruit sent by local churches from amongst their harvest festival gifts, 1936 Photo: Getty Our stewardship, our custodianship of the landscape is celebrated at this point in the calendar with the fruits of our labours, and they must not be discounted. I cherish the story of a vicar who, at harvest time, leant over a fence to watch a gardener cultivating the soil. Around him were portly cabbages, pristine cauliflowers and runner bean vines dripping with succulent pods. Fat onions lay ripening in the sun and potatoes were being unearthed from the rich and fertile loam. “Isn’t it wonderful what God can do in a garden?” remarked the vicar. “Yes,” replied the gardener, “but you should have seen what it was like when he had it to himself.” Trick or treat! Photo: Alamy Hallowe’en , the eve of All Hallows’ Day, originated as a time to remember the dead: the saints (the hallowed) and martyrs in particular, and the strange customs that grew up around it were designed to display man’s mockery of death – hence the grotesque faces of the turnip lanterns of my childhood, made from a hollowed-out swede that stank abominably when the candle flame came too close to its flesh. Today we have pumpkin lanterns and trick-or-treating, both of them American imports. “Give us some sweets or we’ll play a trick on you,” say the children. Hallowe’en?
