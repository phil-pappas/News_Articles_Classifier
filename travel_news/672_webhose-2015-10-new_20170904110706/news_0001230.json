It was a calm, leisurely ride without disturbing the beautiful pictures created on the surface of water by the slanting coconut trees and the lush greenery in both banks. The boat proceeded serenely, making way amidst the branches of trees that reached out to touch the water. The whole experience was bringing tranquility on the faces of our foreign fellow travelers, who had come here to escape from the hustle and bustle of busy Western urban life.\nThe journey is along the canals at Munroe Island, Kollam. Andrea, Nilos, Moritz and Kim Borter were our fellow travellers. The ride was a soothing experience for us too, entirely different from the daily routine of adventurous travel on the congested roads of Kerala.\nThe foreign tourists were having a great time, enjoying the glimpses of rustic life on either side. After some time, the boat stopped by for them to have tea. On the shore, local people were making coir and the foreigners watched the whole process in awe. Then came another boat, carrying a couple. They were Prof Ahmos and wife Eboni from Egypt. Sitting on the chairs they leisurely sipped the tea and enjoyed the breeze, trying to forget the chaos back in their native land.\nWe continued our journey. Now there are two country boats in the water. They are carrying travellers to exquisite vistas of incredible beauty. The boat is heading towards the prawns hatchery, past the scenic temple courtyard and the banyan tree platform. The journey that starts at Karoothrakkadavu, concludes at the same place. We the travellers wish the journey would never end.\nThe canal ride in Munroe Island is a tour package that has become super hit within a short period of time. Most of the visitors to this place are foreigners and North Indian tourists. The price of the package is Rs 500 per person. The tourists will be taken to the Munroe Island in a Tempo Traveller from the office of the Kollam District Tourism Promotion Council office near Boat Jetty. The boat ride would start from Karoothrakkadavu and end at the same place. It is a five-and-a-half kilometer journey through the canal. Tourists can choose from two timings- one that starts at 9 am and ends at 1.30pm or the other that starts at 2pm and ends at 6.30pm.\nThere is also another package worth Rs 1,750 that includes massage in the Ayurveda centre. In yet another package worth Rs 1,500, the journey starts at 10am and ends at 5pm.\nThe Munroe Island was formed by the sediments brought by the Kallada River to Ashtamudi Lake. This fertile land filled with canals, coconut trees and paddy fields is also rich in biodiversity. Delicacies from the lake such as prawns, pomfrets and clams are available here.\nThe island, which was the favourite place of Colonel Munroe, was later named after him.\nMunroe Island\nMunroe Island (or Munroothuruthu, Manrothuruthu, Munroethuruth) is located at the confluence of Ashtamudi Lake and the Kallada River in Kollam district of Kerala in South India. The island, accessible by road, rail and inland water navigation, is about 25 kilometres from Kollam by road, 12 kilometres west from Kundara and about 25 kilometres from Karunagapally.
