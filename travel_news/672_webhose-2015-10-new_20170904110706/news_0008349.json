Joseph Tuite earned himself a place on the shortlist for this season’s outstanding training feats when he sent out Litigant to win the Ebor in August on his first run for 16 months. He is now bidding to supplement that victory by taking the Long Distance Cup with the lightly-raced seven-year-old. The 48-year-old trainer, born in Meath to a dairy farmer, arrived from Ireland 30 years ago to follow his dream of becoming a jump jockey. “It didn’t take long to find out I wasn’t good enough,” he said. But he stayed and is now a popular part of the Lambourn furniture. Long-term jobs followed as right-hand man to Charlie Egerton and Mick Channon and in 2010 he took the plunge to fly solo. At that stage Litigant was a promising two-year-old homebred for Godolphin in France. After a debut defeat as a three-year-old in 2011 he won his remaining two starts in France, but a catalogue of problems meant he did not resurface until he went to Doncaster Sales in January 2013, where he was bought for £18,500 by his present owner Tony Burn. Even then his first trip was to the vet to have a blind wolf-tooth removed, but it proved a turning point. His only defeat in four starts for Seamus Durack was at Kempton first time out after almost 2½ years off, but he was moved to Tuite last December. “He had a bit of tendon trouble,” Tuite said, “so we took our time and that came right, but all the other bits attached had problems. He has issues with his back and joints and his hocks aren’t great. But through Nicole Brown, the physiotherapist, Peter Thurlow, my vet and Chris Martin, my head lad, we have managed to keep him patched up. I won’t even feel his legs now – I leave that to Chris. It worries me too much, but if Chris is happy, I’m happy.” But if Litigant’s stop-start career has been beset by hiccups, there have been none since York. “It’s stepping up to Group level from a handicap but he’s in great form and it’s all been plain sailing since the Ebor,” Tuite said. “We feel he’s improved for the run and that he’s a better horse going into this race – though he needs to be. The conditions are perfect.” If nothing else, it seems, Tuite has a good chance of talking the horse to victory. “He’s only been beaten once on turf, first time out as a three-year-old,” he said, delighted to be going to Champions’ Day with a competitive horse. “We feel we’ve got a live chance.” Meanwhile Cirrus Des Aigles, the winner in 2011 and twice second, will miss the Champions Stakes for the first time since the race was moved to Ascot. The favourite, John Gosden’s Jack Hobbs, will have to overcome a wide draw from stall 12. Only his pacemaker Maverick Wave is wider.
