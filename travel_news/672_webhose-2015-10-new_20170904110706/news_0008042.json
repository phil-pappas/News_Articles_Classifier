We have been raising this demand, but the state government has not acted on it,\" K. G. Pankajakshan, district secretary of AITUC, told Deccan Chronicle.\n\"Our duty is to ensure pay for the workers. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that it takes the possession of the land and develops it further.\"\nMeanwhile, Congress party leaders have thwarted the efforts of a pro-CPM union to take over the property of the Comtrust established by the Basel Mission.\nDistrict Congress president K. C. Abu said more revelations on the pro-CPM union's move would come out in the coming days.\nStates: Kerala South kerala Comtrust Also Read Girl hacked to death by lover Kerala imposes ban on sale of Maggi noodles in government outlets LDF targets graft, neglect Aim for power in state, says Amit Shah", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/COMTRUST%20BUILDING.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/nation-current-affairs/article/government-fails-take-over-comtrust", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/COMTRUST%20BUILDING.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:30:00.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
