For those hoping to take a piece of the city’s fashion scene back home, there are countless department stores, concept shops, and boutiques to peruse—quite an undertaking for one day. Never fear: We’ve asked Soo Joo Park to share her insider’s guide to shopping in the city. Here, her seven go-to spots and tips on how to do Korean retail therapy like a top model— gonbae!\nA Land in Garosu-gil\nA Land embodies Seoul ’s trendy concept of a “select-shop.” There are many locations including one in Myeong-dong (an older shopping area north of the river), but my favorite is located in Garosu-gil, a long avenue in Gangnam filled with cafés and small local boutiques that has become beyond popular. Besides its central location, the shop itself is great—they carry mostly young and new, emerging designers, such as Low Classic, SJYP, and Fleamadonna. The price point is varied as well, from cute socks and cups starting around $7 to coats or handbags that hit mid-$500. I feel like I always end up walking out of this shop with a shopping bag and a receipt.\nBoon the Shop in Cheongdam\nNestled in the posh shopping district in Seoul, strolling through Boon the Shop feels more like a walk through a museum than a department store. It opened just last year and has floor upon floor of well-selected pieces from internationally renowned designers. I usually hop around this area, going from Boon to 10 Corso Como , which is just a few steps away and has a great café on the ground floor to rest your tired feet.\nPyeong Hwa Fashion Town in Dongdaemun\nPyeong Hwa is part of a large street market district directly across the street from Dongdaemun Design Plaza, where most of the Seoul Fashion Week shows are held. Along with the large snazzy, colorful signage, there’s a certain sense of Old World nostalgia mixed into this area. Here they have lots of little kiosks and shops that have hats, scarves, army uniforms, and silk bomber jackets—I got mine here last year.\nDoota in Dongdaemun\nDoota, short for Doosan Tower, is open 24 hours. It’s a high-rise building filled with trendy clothes and accessories for men, women, children—and pets! I hardly step foot into this place, because once you walk in, it’s like a maze that keeps going, and you lose track of time . . . like Vegas. But it’s an experience I recommend for first-timers, who can get a glimpse of the hype and fast-paced life in today’s Korean culture.\nGwangjang Market in Namdaemun\nGwangjang Market has heaps of vintage clothing, as well as miscellaneous handcrafts and traditional silk and textiles. It’s more of a flea market, but with patience and an acute thrifting radar, you can score some cool things for hardly any money.\nMaison des Bougies in Itaewon\nMaison des Bougies is a small candle boutique nestled inside a cool area called Itaewon. I love their candles, which are made from soy and and shea. Each fragrance takes its name from cities or neighborhoods, such as Daikanyama, Marais in Paris, and Brooklyn , New York , and of course, I love the nice packaging. From here, take a walk toward MoMo , a cool bar and café where you can hang out with unlimited drinks—they charge by the hour—and stop and check out the Steve J & Yoni P boutique, as well as cute miscellaneous ceramics and flower shops along the way.\nSSG Food Market around Seoul\nThis gourmet market has restaurants and sells domestic and seasonal health-conscious food—for when you get tired of shopping for clothes and bags.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:34:00.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
