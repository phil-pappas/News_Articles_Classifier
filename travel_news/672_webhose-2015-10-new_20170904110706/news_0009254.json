Kennedy (JFK) International Airport on Nov. 23, 2015. \nThe updated arrival date and additional capacity for A380 service comes in response to strong demand from Etihad Airways guests who are traveling during the United States’ busy Thanksgiving holiday, as well as to attend the 2015 Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix taking place Nov. 27-29, 2015. The new service was originally scheduled to begin on Dec. 1, 2015 and will replace one of the existing Boeing 777 services. \nEtihad President and Chief Executive Officer James Hogan said: “Etihad Airways is committed to reimagining the travel experience to offer the ultimate in luxury, comfort and service for our guests. The overwhelmingly positive response we have received to our A380 service on our Abu Dhabi to London and Sydney routes, as well as for our upcoming launch to New York has exceeded our expectations. With the early introduction of our A380 service into New York, we look forward to further redefining what world-class air travel can be for our guests traveling on Etihad Airways across all classes of service.” \nFrom the moment they begin their journey, guests in The Residence by Etihad enjoy the ultimate in luxury: a chauffeur-driven ride to the airport; up to two guests on board will experience a private three-room suite that includes a living room, a double bedroom, and a separate ensuite shower room. Guests also have access to the Etihad Lifestyle Concierge team, which works closely with the airline’s in-flight, Savoy-trained butlers to deliver highly personalized service both on the ground and in the air, including dining reservations, entertainment bookings, special events, destination information and lifestyle services. \nThe 9 First Apartments in First Class are completely private living spaces featuring a reclining lounge chair and an ottoman, which opens up to become a separate 80.5 inch long fully-flat bed. \nA total of 70 Business Studios are located on the upper deck of the A380, all offering direct aisle access, a fully flat bed of up to 80.5 inches long, and an increase of 20 per cent in personal space. The Lobby, a luxurious lounge located between the First Class and Business Class cabins, features two comfortable leather sofas and a staffed bar serving a wide selection of hot snacks and refreshments. \nThe main deck features 415 Economy Smart Seats, which provide enhanced comfort with a unique ‘fixed wing’ headrest on each seat, adjustable lumbar support, and a seat width of almost 19 inches. Etihad Airways has introduced the latest Panasonic eX3 entertainment system on its A380 fleet, providing more than 750 hours of on-demand entertainment, improved gaming, and high definition screens across all cabins. The A380 has full mobile and Wi-Fi service, with USB and power points at every seat. \nEtihad Airways will offer daily service with the airline’s new A380 between the two cities, with EY103 departing Abu Dhabi at 3:20 a.m. and arriving at 9:10 a.m. in New York. The return flight, EY102, will depart New York at 2:30 p.m. and arrive the next day in Abu Dhabi at 12:15 p.m. \nDaily flight schedule between Abu Dhabi and JFK, beginning Nov. 23, 2015: \nFlight No. Origin Departs Destination Arrives Aircraft \nEY103 AUH 3:20 AM JFK 9:10 AM A380 EY102 JFK 2:30 PM AUH 12:15 PM (+1) A380 EY 101 AUH 10:35 AM JFK 4:25 PM B777-300ER* EY 100 JFK 10:00 PM AUH 7:45 PM (+1) B777-300ER* \nNote: All departures and arrivals are listed in local time. * Jet Airways B777operated by Etihad Airways \nEtihad Airways’ A380 first entered into service between Abu Dhabi and London Heathrow Airport on Dec. 27, 2014 before commencing service between Abu Dhabi and Sydney on May 31, 2015. \nEtihad Airways offers 45 weekly return flights from Abu Dhabi to six U.S. cities, including Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Los Angeles, New York- JFK, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. \nThrough Etihad Airways’ hub in Abu Dhabi, the airline provides passengers from the United States direct access to the U.A.E. capital, and seamless connections to the Middle East, Africa, Indian Sub-continent and South East Asia. \nGuests flying on all Etihad Airways flights from Abu Dhabi to the airline’s six U.S. ports of entry, including JFK Airport, are processed through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Preclearance facility available at Abu Dhabi International Airport, which allows them to pass through all U.S. immigration and customs checks in Abu Dhabi and arrive at their U.S. destination as domestic passengers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:49:03.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
