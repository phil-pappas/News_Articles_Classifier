(Nasdaq: MXWL), a leading developer and manufacturer of ultracapacitor-based energy storage and power delivery products, announced today its ultracapacitors have been selected by CAF Power & Automation , a global manufacturer of railway vehicles and equipment, as a standard component of the energy-storage system ACR (Rapid Charge Accumulator) used to power light-rail cars. Among the latest projects, CAF's ACR energy-storage system will be used on the first 100 percent catenary-free light-rail line currently under construction in Kaohsiung, Taiwan , and in new tramways for an existing rail line in Tallinn ( Estonia ) for energy-saving purposes.\nCapacitive energy-storage technology delivers high-density power supply to a number of rail-transportation applications. Maxwell ultracapacitors are especially well-suited for onboard commuter rolling modalities, such as CAF's electric light-rail trams, because of the seamless ability to capture and discharge power rapidly. CAF chose to work with Maxwell to ensure its ACR delivered instant power and energy recuperation from frequent braking, without requiring unsightly overhead electrical wiring. As part of CAF's ACR system, Maxwell's ultracapacitors are expected to provide up to 30 percent savings in energy consumption.\n\"Globally, new innovative energy technologies are in great demand, and we don't expect that trend to slow down over the next few years,\" Harkaitz Ibaiondo, sales & marketing director of CAF, said. \"Our ACR energy-storage system is a key component of the transportation solutions implemented to satisfy this demand. Maxwell's ultracapacitors were a perfect option for energy recuperation and fast power delivery within our product. Their expertise and leadership in capacitive energy storage is exactly what we needed.\"\n\"Ultracapacitors have drawn great interest from leading rail transportation companies worldwide,\" Dr. Franz Fink , president and chief executive officer for Maxwell, said. \"The demand for alternative energy storage and power delivery makes Maxwell's ultracapacitors a perfect fit for CAF. This is further validation of our ability to deliver technology that improves both energy efficiency and carbon emissions.\"\nAdditional Maxwell Technologies information:\nMaxwell Technologies' blog: http://bit.ly/1O0L7XR Maxwell Technologies on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Maxwell_Tech Maxwell Technologies on Facebook: http://on.fb.me/10e2nPA Maxwell Technologies on LinkedIn: http://linkd.in/Z4737Y Maxwell Technologies on Google+: https://plus.google.com/+MaxwellTech/ About Maxwell: Maxwell is a global leader in the development and manufacture of innovative, cost-effective energy storage and power delivery solutions.
