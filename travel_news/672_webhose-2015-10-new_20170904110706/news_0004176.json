Among the museum's features were a 15-foot-long model of the USS Saratoga aircraft carrier and an exhibit about the Titanic. \nMuseum Director Paul Ghiotto says that arrangements are being made to donate most exhibits to museums and historical societies. \nIt took about $45,000 to pay the annual bills for the 7,500-square-foot facility. Ghiotto says about $1,000 a month from donations, 75 paid memberships and money from the gift shop was not enough to keep the museum up and running. The museum opened in 1987. \nGhiotto says the chance to educate people was well worth the effort. \nInformation from: The (Jacksonville) Florida Times-Union, http://www.jacksonville.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:48:45.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
