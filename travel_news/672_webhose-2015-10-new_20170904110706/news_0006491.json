Brittany, being just the other side of the Channel, has weather that can be a bit, well, English.\n“More like a bit Welsh,” remarked my wife, recalling her Cardiff days.\nWe got a taste of it before we even reached the campsite.\nBeing too early to check in we explored a beach called St Colomban, just outside the beautiful town of Carnac on the southern Breton coast.\nLike so many beaches in the area it is a gentle crescent of fine sand, bracketed at either end with rocky outcrops, as if nature wanted to give it some privacy.\nBut after no more than 15 minutes, ­lifeguards ordered everyone out of the water: a storm was coming.\nThis was August but, sure enough, minutes later the sky was lit up by ­lightning, followed by thunder and a downpour. That set the pattern for the next five days.\nOn the plus side, our campsite contained plenty to keep us busy without the need to brave the elements.\nLa Grande Metairie is one of 41 sites across France run by outdoor holiday specialist Les Castels.\nWithout doubt, the jewel in its crown is the swimming pool complex.\nPerfect pools: La Grande Metaire campsite\nThere’s a heated indoor pool, another with a moveable roof, and a giant outdoor curling lagoon with a series of water slides, all surrounded by sun-loungers – sadly largely superfluous during my stay.\nA restaurant overlooks the lagoon, plus there’s a takeaway, bar, indoor games area, outdoor entertainment arena, volleyball and tennis courts, bike hire, crazy golf, woodland climbing and zip-wires, and a shop for essentials such as fresh croissants and baguettes for breakfast, all set under a canopy of pine trees.\nAccommodation ranges from tent plots to mobile homes that sleep four, to luxury ones for eight with a private hot tub next to a covered veranda.\nI had just one grumble: 30 euros for a week’s wi-fi is a bit cheeky.\nThe location is remarkable because across the road from these modern conveniences lie Les Alignements.\nIn the shade: Andrew needed a hat when the sun finally came out\nThere are hundreds of these megalithic stone monuments lined up in neat rows and, although not as tall as Stonehenge, what they lack in size they make up for in quantity.\nOne legend is that they are a Roman legion turned to stone by Merlin, even though they date from at least 3,000 years before Romans set foot in Brittany.\nDon’t bother with the museum of prehistory in Carnac if you’re hoping for a better explanation, it inexplicably hardly mentions Les Alignements.\nCarnac is a gorgeous old town, built from that same rock that makes Breton houses look as solid as castles, and presumably helps keep out the rain.\nThe easiest way to reach it is by ferry to St Malo, and as you drive across Brittany you can stop at stunning historic towns such as Lamballe and Josselin.\nPostcards acknowledge the ­“changeable” weather, typically featuring locals standing in a gale saying things like “This year we’ve got it lucky” or two Breton “nudists” clad in sou’westers.\nCarnac has a good selection of restaurants, the star being the multiple award-winning La Potion Magique.\nI had to visit, intrigued to discover how something as humble as a creperie could win such accolades.\nThe answer lies in its galettes, a savoury staple in this part of France, almost the equivalent of the pizza in Italy, but so much more versatile and tasty when made properly, which means with buckwheat flour – sarrasin or blé noir in French.\nSeveral fillings included andouillette, a word I can never remember, so the waitress insisted on bringing us a sample before ordering.\nBeautiful beach: The Brittany coast\nPale grey slivers arrived and, between my French and her English, I think it turned out to be stomach lining. I gave it a swerve and went for Roquefort sauce, walnuts and green salad, all on a galette as thin as lace and brown as those Breton rocky outcrops.\nThe perfect meal was rounded off with an eponymous Potion Magique, the restaurant’s concoction of local mead and ­blackcurrant liqueur.\nThere was another delightful touch.\nThat day an unfamiliar bright round object had appeared in the clear blue sky and, as we sat on the balcony of the restaurant, the ­waitress appeared with hats for the diners, because now we were being dazzled by the setting sun.\nI suddenly remembered why I love Brittany so much and keep coming back here.\nYes, the weather can be as dodgy as anything you’ll get on the Gower Peninsula, but when the sun does come out, there really isn’t a more enchanting place to be.\nGet there Les Castels has 41 French campsites with mobile homes (sleep up to 5) from ¤273 for 7nts s/c.
