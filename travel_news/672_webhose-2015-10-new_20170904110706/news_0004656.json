She will also create content and share her wellness and fitness choices on social media channels in order to reach a wider audience of guests and associates around the world.\nLara Dutta said, “I am delighted to be a part of the Westin Well –Being Movement. I have always believed in a holistic approach to wellness; what one eats, what exercise regimen one follows and how one counters stress. The key to wellness is balance and positive thinking. I have benefited from this in my profession and personal life. Through this association, I look forward to sharing my own knowledge and experience with others.”\nAs a former Miss Universe as well as in her current role as a film actor, Lara Dutta has become a wellness inspiration to many. She has been practicing yoga for over 12 years and has also launched her Prenatal Yoga CD, helping pregnant women and young mothers to adopt a balanced and stress-free lifestyle. Her proactive approach to wellbeing suitably aligns with Westin brand’s six pillars of wellness: sleep well, eat well, move well, feel well, work well and play well. Westin Hotels & Resorts has been an industry innovator with a history of firsts in the wellness space, and partnering Lara as the first well-being brand advocate in India reinforces the Westin brand’s continued push to deliver wellness on the road.\nVincent Ong , senior brand director, brand management, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Asia Pacific said, “We are thrilled to have Lara Dutta on board as Asia Pacific’s newest Well-Being Brand Advocate for Westin. What makes Lara’s association with the well-being movement relevant is her holistic approach to life as well as her enthusiasm for healthy living throughout her career from Miss Universe to a working mother. We see this partnership with Lara as yet another innovative way the Westin Well-Being Movement transcends to our guests and associates; inspiring them to lead a healthier life.”\n 21, 2015 5:41 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:23:00.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
