The service begins on May 11, 2016 and will be operated by an Airbus A330-300 five times per week.\nThe new eastbound LH 481 service will operate on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, departing Denver at 4:05 p.m. and arriving in Munich the following morning. The corresponding westbound LH 480 service will also operate on Tuesdays, Wednesday , Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, departing from Lufthansa’s Munich hub at 11:45 a.m. and arriving in Denver at 2:30 p.m. (all times local) after a 10 hour, 45 minute flight.\n“Denver has been an important U.S. gateway for Lufthansa since 2001. Nearly three million travelers have flown Lufthansa to and from the Mile High City, and the return of direct flights to Munich displays just how important the Denver market is to our airline,” said Juergen Siebenrock, Vice President The Americas at Lufthansa German Airlines. “With all classes now offering the newest onboard product, our passengers traveling to Munich will experience the highest level of quality, as well as the premium customer service, that Lufthansa is known for.”\n“Each new nonstop, international flight generates economic activity, creates new jobs and raises Denver’s profile on the global stage,” said Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock. “Lufthansa’s Munich service is estimated to generate more than 700 new jobs and $24 million in new wages for the state, as well as boost statewide economic output by more than $80 million annually.”\nThe Denver-Munich flight, which has a capacity of 236 seats, represents the first time that the A330-300 aircraft has been scheduled for regular service at DEN. The new First Class product, which has a five-star rating from Skytrax, provides outstanding comfort and comprehensive service. The new Business Class has 30 seats, which can each be transformed into a comfortable bed with a horizontal reclining area of nearly six and half feet at the touch of a button. Located between Business and Economy Class, the new Premium Economy Class offers enhanced services, as well as seats that feature adjustable head and foot rests and have a pitch of 38 inches. Lufthansa’s Premium Economy seats are up to 1.2 inches wider than standard Economy. The A330-300’s configuration also includes 177 Economy Class seats.\n“Lufthansa’s nonstop service between Denver and Munich will stimulate travel between two regions that are already rich with synergies – from world-class beer festivals to innovation and entrepreneurship, Colorado and Bavaria are deeply connected,” said DEN CEO Kim Day. “Europe ranks as Denver’s largest international market by region, accounting for nearly 30 percent of total passenger volume. This new service will increase Denver’s transatlantic capacity by 23 percent, and increase our number of nonstop destinations served to 21.”\nUnited Airlines, Lufthansa’s Star Alliance and joint venture partner, will offer travelers convenient connections at its Denver hub to and from 85 destinations in North America. “This new Munich service will continue the strong relationship we have built with Lufthansa to better serve our mutual customers with more flights to more destinations on both sides of the Atlantic,” said John Gebo, United’s senior vice president of alliances.\nMunich International Airport is Europe’s seventh busiest and most convenient hub. In 2015, Skytrax named it Europe’s best airport and it has been among the world’s top six airports for ten consecutive years. Passengers arriving at Munich’s award-winning Terminal 2 from Denver will enjoy an industry-leading 40-minute minimum connection time to 150 destinations served by Lufthansa and 21 partner airlines.\nVisitors to Munich, the Bavarian capital, will experience a city full of old-world charm and new world technology. Known all over the world for its beer gardens, Oktoberfest and Christmas Markets, Munich is described as having a village-feel with famous squares throughout, including Marienplatz at its center and the neo-Classical Königsplatz, which boasts the Propylaen gateway and Glyptothek, a collection of Greek and Roman sculptures. The city’s location also allows for many convenient day-trips, among them Neuschwanstein Castle in the Alps and Salzburg, Austria.\nFor business travelers, Munich offers a strongly diversified economy. It is the European headquarters of many international companies, among them Siemens, BMW, Allianz, Linde and Infineon, is considered the high-tech capital of Germany, and is second only to New York in the number of publishing houses.\nRound-trip fares on Lufthansa from Denver to Europe will be available starting at approximately $980.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:31:23.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
