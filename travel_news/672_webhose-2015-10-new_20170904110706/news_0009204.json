Source: AFP\nSobers effectively accused them of only playing for themselves.\n“My whole obligation was to West Indies cricket,” Sobers said. “As I have always said, I have never made a run for me. Records meant nothing. The team was important.\n“I don’t think we have that kind of person in West Indies cricket anymore, who’s quite prepared to play and to give everything to their country. And that hurts.”\nAs Sobers spoke of the hurt, tears began to well in his eyes and his voice wavered, giving a clear indication of just how painful it is for one of the giants of the game to see his once great cricketing nation continue to struggle on the world stage.\n“Until we can get people who are willing to play for West Indies in the right way, I think that we’re going to be struggling for a long time.”\nWatch the second Test between Sri Lanka and West Indies LIVE on Fox Sports Channel 505.\n Cricket’s tear jerking press conference", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/22/1227578/826288-65c25cca-7879-11e5-84c7-74266c47d5ee.jpg", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/sri-lanka-v-west-indies-sir-garfield-sobers-brought-to-tears-by-windies-plight/story-e6frf3g3-1227578826315"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:28:21.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
