Already having strong presence in the region, with offices in Los Angeles, Houston, New York and Toronto, Richard Thompson, President of ACS North America, explains the need for the new operation: “We have a really strong customer base in Florida and decided that now was the right time to open an office in closer proximity to some of those clients.” \nHeading up the office will be Joel Fenn, who has been working in the company’s Hong Kong operation for the past two and a half years. Fenn started his ACS career over ten years ago in the company’s London headquarters, where he worked his way up to the position of Director, before taking on the same role in the Hong Kong operation. Thompson says of Fenn: “Joel has the required experience to lead the team in the new office and build the operation up to match the size of our other North American offices.” Fenn added: “Miami is a major hub between the US and Latin America and is the second largest finance and banking region of the US, which makes it an ideal location for our newest office. We have brought in a mixture of experienced account managers from other ACS offices and hired locally as well. We are all very excited about this new venture.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:56:58.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
