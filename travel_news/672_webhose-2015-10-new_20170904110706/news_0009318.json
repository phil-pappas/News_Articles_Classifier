While between 6,000 and 13,000 are believed to exist, their populations are isolated and spread out over wide areas.\nThis fragmentation means each group contains anywhere from a handful of birds to 100 individuals.\nThere are far fewer left among the great green macaws of Central America and parts of northern South America — with just 1,000 to 3,000 individuals remaining in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.\nRelated: Saving the great green macaw\nThe ruling will be published in the Federal Register on Friday and goes into effect a month later, on Nov. 2.", "external_links": ["http://www.fws.gov/endangered/news/pdf/Military%20and%20great%20green%20macaws%20FL%20NR%20Final.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:15.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
