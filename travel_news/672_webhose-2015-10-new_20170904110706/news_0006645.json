A study from the Crossmodal Research Laboratory at the University of Oxford presented 60 diners with three salads, each using identical ingredients, but plated differently: One was a “standard” tossed salad, one was neatly arranged by ingredient in a grid-like pattern, and one was artistically arranged to mimic Kandinsky’s Painting No. 201 . Not only did diners prefer the Kandinsky salad, but they also indicated they would be willing to pay more for the dish.\nPlating has become something of an obsession, seemingly borne of the wave of Instagram-obsessed diners and the era of “ food porn ,” but the roots of visually focused food presentation run much deeper. Ophelia Deroy of the Center for the Study of the Senses at the University of London points out that medieval cookbooks featured drawings detailing how dishes should be presented to distract from a “lack of any great refinement in flavours” and centuries later, Louis XIV ushered in the era of dramatically plated “haute cuisine” for the nobility. Fast-forward to the ’60s and more refined Japanese plating techniques began to influence French chefs, helping to usher in the nouvelle cuisine movement. And the quest for stunning gastronomic creations hasn’t waned. Above, we are taking a look at 12 dishes, available now at some of the world’s top restaurants and photographed for The Art of Plating , that should be on any aesthete’s must-eat list.", "external_links": ["http://theartofplating.com/"], "published": "2015-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:10:58.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
