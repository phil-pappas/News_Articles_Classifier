He visited Simmons-Pinckney Middle School and Burke High School band students, talking about music and offering a demonstration of his virtuoso skills. The kids sat rapt as Gordon spoke about warming up, improvising, the lessons of jazz music, the challenges of practicing and the benefits of singing. “Everything I play, I sing,” he said. “If you can sing something, you can play it.” The education outreach session was organized by Jazz Artists of Charleston and sponsored by Fox Music and Yamaha. Band teacher Linard McCloud observed the interaction, a smile flickering across his face at regular intervals. “Every so often we get a treat,” he told his students at the end of the meeting. Gordon began playing music at an early age, first piano, then trombone (and eventually 21 other instruments, he said). As a child, he worked under a school band director who always said, “You can do it,” and Gordon believed it. “So I was never afraid to try,” he said, even if didn’t always succeed. He first picked up the trombone in seventh grade but continued to play piano. Tuba was his second brass instrument, he said. He attended Florida State A&M University, playing in its marching band. While in college he met famed trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and soon went on a short tour with him. Gordon ended up joining Marsalis’ bands — first the quintet (which toured for many years), then the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. He told Burke students that the word “improvise” comes from “improve.” One improvises on a melody to improve it, he said, demonstrating what he meant by playing a New Orleans-style rendition of “Happy Birthday.” Jazz, he said, opens one’s ears. The player must listen carefully to everyone else. Ultimately, the instrument is just the tool, he added. The music comes from within. When he demonstrated his ideas by playing his trombone — and later his soprano trombone — the students could see how perfectly connected Gordon is to his instrument, how it is an extension of his body. They listened with wide eyes as Gordon caused the trombone to make all sorts of sounds, even mimic an Australian didgeridoo. Sometimes he fluttered his lips to create a staccato effect; sometimes he played and vocalized simultaneously; sometimes he played a smooth blues sequence; sometimes he played quick runs. At the end of the session, he explained why he admired Louis Armstrong so much. Not only was “Pops” a great musician, he was a great humanitarian, steeped in his particular historical moment and determined to contradict the social status quo, Gordon said. Then the free tickets were handed out. The Charleston Jazz Orchestra and Gordon perform at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. Saturday at the Charleston Music Hall. For more information, go to charlestonjazz.com .
