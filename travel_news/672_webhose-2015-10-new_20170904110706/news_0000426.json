Hyundai continues to add compelling premium-market appeal to the Genesis sedan for the 2016 model year. HID headlights and LED Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) are now standard for 2016, while ultra-premium LED fog lights are now available on the 3.8 model, further enhancing the Genesis exterior lighting signature.\nAlso for 2016, Genesis 5.0 models are now only available in the fully-equipped Ultimate trim designation. 2016 Genesis models will begin arriving in dealerships in November.\n2016 Hyundai Genesis\nMSRP\nGenesis 3.8 RWD\n3.8L V6\n$38,750\nGenesis 3.8 AWD\n3.8L V6\n$41,250\nGenesis 5.0 RWD\n5.0L V8\n$53,850\nGenesis represents a bold step forward for Hyundai, continuing to build upon its successful strategy of marketing its premium models under the Hyundai brand umbrella, rather than a costly, separate luxury brand sales channel. The Genesis is incredibly well-equipped in every configuration, offering even more content than the first-generation Genesis. This content includes a generous suite of standard safety and convenience features, unsurpassed in its class. A sophisticated AWD system is available, known as HTRAC ®, , which has broadened Genesis appeal in the snowbelt regions throughout the U.S. The Genesis is manufactured at Hyundai's Ulsan, Korea plant.\nFLUIDIC SCULPTURE\nSince its 2009 debut on the Sonata sedan, Hyundai's Fluidic Sculpture design philosophy has been continually enhanced and refined, progressively influencing every model in the Hyundai line-up. The 2016 Genesis embodies the second-generation of this convention-shattering design theme.\nFluidic Sculpture encapsulates a trio of main design elements: fluid aesthetics, the modern Hyundai look, and a premium ambience. Fluidic forms are present but with a refined and precise presentation. This latest design philosophy is adaptable to a wider range of vehicle types and sizes, from CUVs to premium-luxury flagships.\nEXTERIOR DESIGN\nThe Genesis expresses a truly modern design through distinctive exterior styling with a sleek, upscale appearance. Evoking a premium feel, the design cues display the Hyundai family aesthetic: simple and harmonious design with refined fluidic elements. The design features the modern Hyundai look, with a striking hexagonal front grille as a key geometric element, a dynamic crease accent running along the flanks of the car, and a dynamic rear design. Design surfaces convey a kinetic elegance, relying more on voluminous body sections than surface details to create dramatic forms. Proportions demonstrate a long dash-to-axle length, longer wheelbase and shorter overhangs than its predecessor. These proportions clearly convey the performance rear-drive configuration beneath the sheetmetal.\nThe single-frame 3D-hexagonal grille ensures the front end of the Genesis is not only striking, depicted in semi-gloss chrome, but also encompasses standard HID headlights, LED Daytime Running Lights and available LED fog lights. In profile, the Genesis daylight opening is expressive, with fluid lines and blended surfaces, a sleek C-pillar helping to emphasize the sporty styling. The rear of the Genesis benefits from a sculptural aesthetic with jeweled, full-LED taillights.\nINTERIOR DESIGN\nThe cabin layout of Genesis has been designed to benefit all occupants with a spacious, comfortable ambience. The simplification of the switchgear and instrument panel ensures an intuitive layout and open feel. This user-centric design has sought to connect the various interior parts effectively, particularly the center stack with the console, upper-instrument panel and B-pillar with the headliner. Genesis displays ultra-precise fit and finish, with ergonomic seat design and a generous, natural feel. Particular design attention has been paid to the storage of practical items such as mobile electronics of all shapes and sizes, along with the flexibility of the cup holders.\nTotal interior volume is an impressive 123.0 cubic feet, an advantage over key competitors. As part of this spacious interior design, the Genesis provides best-in-class front headroom and rear shoulder room.\nHyundai Genesis\nCadillac\nCTS\nLexus\nGS\nInfiniti\nQ70\nBMW\n5-Series\nM-B\nE-Class\nTotal Interior Volume (cu. ft.)\n123.0\n110.7\n113.3\n118.5\n116.0\n113.1\nHyundai interior design principles – safety, intuitiveness and simplicity – guided the Genesis design team in designing all primary controls to deliver maximum ease of use. Ergonomic ease of reach and control have been meticulously evaluated and executed using a specially-designed laboratory tool created to measure occupant operational force for ergonomics.\nThe interior surfaces have been developed to decrease relative interior reflections and brighten dashboard surfaces, while high-grade materials such as genuine aluminum and matte-finish wood are available. Cohesion between the center fascia and audio controls has been ensured through a streamlined design, making the two separate sections appear as one. To ensure a luxurious feel, Genesis was intensely scrutinized for its use of materials, with extensive analysis of the relationship of different materials, their texture and color coordination.\nDriver and passenger posture are optimized using enhanced seat pad density, improved seat support technologies, such as adjustable driver's seat power bolsters and seat cushion extension. Genesis offer 12-way power front seats, including 4-way power lumbar, heated front seats with available ventilation, as well as heated rear seats on HTRAC AWD models. Seat materials and stitching quality utilize double, rather than single stitching. The driver's seat incorporates functionality with an available air-pressure pump and controller valve, providing seatback bolster adjustment through individual air-cells located in the seat. With a total operating time under 8-seconds, the Genesis benefits from both a faster activation process and greater range of adjustment than many competitive rivals.\nULTRA-RIGID PLATFORM\nThe 2016 Genesis platform employs advanced high-strength steel, composing over 50 percent of its total platform composition. The benefits of strategic use of high-strength steel are immediately evident in torsional and bending rigidity. As a result, the Genesis is stiffer in both torsional and bending rigidity than the BMW 5-series.\nEnsuring a smooth ride over rough roads was a top development focus, achieved by a robust connecting structure, extensive laser welding, reinforced body and chassis mounting points, hot stamping and dipping techniques for the B-pillar and roof sides, and a high level of high-strength steel in the chassis. Front shock towers are made of aluminum, and a diamond-shaped strut bar maximizes front structure rigidity for precise steering response.\nPERFORMANCE CHASSIS\nFully leveraging this rigid chassis is a rear multi-link suspension, with optimized 5-link geometry and increased suspension travel for a broader envelope of both dynamic performance and ride comfort. Lateral suspension stiffness and overall ride comfort refinement were top priorities in its dynamic development. The fully-independent, 5-link front and rear suspension designs have increased stiffness compared with the original Genesis, with increased front and rear suspension travel, for greater wheel articulation and bump absorption over a variety of road surfaces. 18-inch and 19-inch alloy wheels resist deflection forces for precise suspension response to changing road surfaces. Handling and roadholding also benefit from a well-balanced 52/48 ratio of front-to-rear weight distribution.\nIn addition, special focus was given to the development of Rack-mounted Motor Driven Electric Power Steering (R-MDPS), with a Variable Gear Ratio (VGR), helping to provide high-speed stability and a direct feel at low and medium speeds. These driving qualities are attained while retaining the incremental fuel economy benefits of an electric system over the higher parasitic losses of hydraulic systems.\nHTRAC ® AWD AVAILABILITY\nThe Genesis is offered with a choice of rear-wheel-drive or HTRAC ® All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) configurations. The HTRAC AWD system was developed as a multi-mode system, providing an electronic, variable-torque-split clutch with active torque control between the front and rear axles.\nThe driver-selectable HTRAC Normal and Sport modes help provide confident control in all-weather conditions. The Sport setting gives a more agile feel by sending more available torque to the rear wheels, for a sporty rear-drive dynamic feel when desired. Further, to maximize efficiency, the system can direct more available torque to the rear wheels during steady-state highway cruising for reduced drivetrain frictional losses and noise. This system has a wider range of torque distribution variability than many competitive systems and has been tuned to variable conditions such as straight-line acceleration, medium- and high-speed cornering, and hill-starts. All modes are programmed in concert with Genesis' Intelligent Drive Mode select.\nDYNAMIC CHASSIS DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING\nIn addition to extensive on-the-road and laboratory testing, circuit-based testing of the Genesis took place in Germany , Korea and Hyundai's California Proving Ground in the U.S. High g-force assessment of the HTRAC AWD system was completed at the Korea International Circuit in Yeongam, the venue for one round of the Formula One World Championship. Durability and high-performance handling driving tests took place on the Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit in Germany to precisely calibrate Genesis ride, braking and handling characteristics. Furthermore, Hyundai engineers collaborated with top dynamics experts such as Lotus Engineering to further validate the performance capability of the Genesis.\nMOST POWERFUL HYUNDAI V8 ENGINE\nThe heart of the Genesis 5.0 is the award-winning 5.0-liter Tau V8 engine producing 420 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 383 lb. ft. of torque at 5,000 rpm. The Tau V8 engine family has been named to Ward's prestigious Ten Best Engines list three times. With high-pressure direct injection for impressive power, low emissions and superb efficiency, this latest version of the Tau V8 benefits from an optimized intake runner length, enhanced timing chain for reduced friction and NVH, low-torque exhaust manifold, increased compression ratio and upgraded multiple-injection mapping. These enhancements combine to produce a flatter torque curve at lower rpm for even better driveability.\nGenesis\n5.0\n5.0L V8\nMercedes\nE400 3.0L V6\nTwin Turbo\nCadillac\nCTS\n3.6L V6 Twin Turbo\nInfiniti\nQ70\n5.6L V8\nAudi\nA6 3.0T\n3.0L V6 SC\nHorsepower (SAE)\n420@6000\n329@5250\n420@5750\n420@6000\n333@5500\n5.0-liter Direct Injection Tau V8 engine\nThe Tau's high 11.8:1 compression ratio increases thermal efficiency and output. The Tau also has a rigid bed plate for improved block rigidity and lower NVH (Noise, Vibration, and Harshness), as well as camshaft carriers and a roller timing chain to improve valvetrain stability.\nEven more, this V8 offers Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing (D-CVVT), a tuned variable induction system, and low-friction coatings on piston skirts. This Tau engine will also run on regular fuel with only a small reduction in peak power, and no negative driving effects, whenever desired.\nThe Tau 5.0-liter V8 is mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. This Hyundai-developed transmission offers enhanced shift logic and speed, better acceleration, sport-mode mapping, shifting smoothness, and transmission efficiency. All eight-speed transmissions include SHIFTRONIC ® manual shift capability with conveniently-located steering wheel paddle shifters to enhance shifting ease.\nDIRECT-INJECTED LAMBDA 3.8-LITER ENGINE\nThe Genesis 3.8-liter direct-injected Lambda engine is optimized to deliver a flatter overall torque curve at low rpm for superb drivability. This engine includes a three-stage variable intake system, triangular-pattern fuel injector for improved combustion, an air-gap exhaust manifold for better NVH, and an upgraded cylinder block with a variable-vane 2-stage oil pump for reduced parasitic losses. In keeping with its 5.0-liter V8 sibling, the Genesis 3.8-liter Lambda engine utilizes direct-injection and produces 311 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 293 lb.-ft. of torque at 5,000 rpm. It also has a high compression ratio of 11.5:1 for greater thermal efficiency. The Lambda engine will run on regular fuel with only a small reduction in peak power, and no negative driving effects, whenever desired by the owner.\nGenesis 3.8\n3.8L V6\nLexus\nGS\n3.5L V6\nMercedes E350\n3.5L V6\nCadillac\nCTS\n2.0 I4 Turbo\nAudi\nA6 2.0T\n2.0L Turbo\nBMW\n535i\n3.0L I6 Turbo\nHorsepower (SAE)\n311@6000\n306@6400\n302@6500\n272@5500\n252@5000\n300@5800\nThe 3.8-liter engine also has Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing (D-CVVT), variable induction, an all-aluminum block and heads, steel timing chain and iridium-tipped spark plugs.

This Hyundai-developed transmission offers enhanced shift logic and speed, better acceleration, sport-mode mapping, shifting smoothness, and transmission efficiency. All eight-speed transmissions include SHIFTRONIC ® manual shift capability with ergonomically-placed paddle shifters.\nSAFETY TECHNOLOGIES\nGenesis offers abundant standard safety features, including Electronic Stability Control (ESC), nine airbags, and energy-absorbing front seats. Genesis' nine airbags include advanced dual front airbags, driver's knee airbag, front and outboard rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags, and roof-mounted side curtain airbags for both front and rear outboard seat occupants.\nThe entire Genesis structure was engineered to meet the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) Top Safety Pick + standard.\nLED Daytime running lights come standard on Genesis. Further, Genesis offers a Lane Departure Warning (LDW). Whenever the system is activated, the haptic steering wheel will provide a vibration warning and dial-integrated warning light to alert drivers of their lane departure, allowing them to reposition the car smoothly into the correct position.\nEven Genesis' tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) provides individual tire pressure readouts available to the driver.\nGenesis is brought to a halt by large four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes with Brake Assist and Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD). Genesis 3.8 models have large 13.6-inch front rotors, while the 5.0 has even larger 14.2-inch front rotors. Both braking systems use four-piston fixed monobloc calipers for precise braking responsiveness.\nSENSORY SURROUND SAFETY TM TECHNOLOGIES\nThe Genesis employs a suite of active driver safety technologies dubbed Sensory Surround Safety TM . These features cover the full spectrum of safety, from driver alertness and focus to total occupant safety, and even the safety of other drivers around you. These features are supplements to the driver's safe, attentive driving.\nGenesis offers Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), utilizing sensor fusion technology to help avoid a potential collision or reduce its impact in certain circumstances. With this supplemental system, Genesis will employ automatic braking when it detects another vehicle at an unsafe closing rate of speed. This system uses the Smart Cruise Control system and the forward camera from Lane Departure Warning (LDW) to provide this extra margin of safety.\nAutomatic Emergency Braking (AEB) Functional Range\nSpeed\nBrake Application\nAEB Result\n50 - 112 mph\nPartial Braking\nCollision Warning\n5 - 50 mph\nFull Braking\nCollision Mitigation\nGenesis' Smart Cruise Control (SCC) incorporates stop-start functionality that functions seamlessly with the standard electronic stability control system. This system for Genesis allows full function down to zero mph to operate seamlessly in stop-and-go traffic conditions, using the front-grille-mounted radar sensor. SCC enables the Genesis to help maintain safer, consistent spacing with the vehicle ahead in varied traffic conditions. The system can also help deploy an available Automatic Emergency Braking system should an impending collision situation be detected with a vehicle ahead.\nGenesis is generously equipped with advanced technologies, many of them Hyundai firsts. A driver-selectable Intelligent Drive Mode allows drivers to select from four drive modes depending on conditions and driving preferences. Each drive mode alters transmission mapping, throttle responsiveness and stability control, with specific modes adapted to function seamlessly with HTRAC AWD for those Genesis so equipped.\nIntelligent Drive Mode\nType of Driving\nECO\nFuel Economy\nNORMAL\nBalanced\nSPORT\nDynamic Focus\nSNOW\nLow-traction conditions\nIn addition to the above modes, Genesis features an Emergency Steering Support Mode which automatically changes the setting of electronic stability control (ESC) in the direction suitable for emergency steering, to help avoid frontal crash situations.\nGenesis also offers a Blind-Spot Detection system (BSD), which helps monitor traffic around the car and supplements the driver checking their surroundings. The system uses radar sensors in the rear bumper to help warn the driver of an approaching vehicle in his or her blind spot via an indicator on the side mirrors. If the driver activates the lane change indicator and attempts to change the lane, ignoring warning indicators, BSD additionally issues an audible warning and haptic steering wheel vibrations. In addition, for Genesis' equipped with the Head's-Up Display, the BSD system indicators also project onto the windshield, nearer the driver's view of the road, a segment first.\nLane Change Assist (LCA) performs a similar function to help detect vehicles approaching towards its rear side at high speeds, especially during higher-speed driving, while Rear Cross-traffic Alert (RCTA) scans areas to each side of the car when drivers are backing out of parking spaces. No other sedan in Genesis' class offers the combination of Blind-Spot Detection, Lane Change Assist, and Rear Cross-traffic Alert active safety systems.\nFrom the front, the available Lane Departure Warning (LDW) captures images of lanes and recognizes the lane marker. If LDW detects lane departure, a warning signal is activated on the instrument panel while issuing a haptic steering wheel vibration warning. Working in concert with LDW, Genesis' Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) performs a similar function of LDW, but LKA additionally provides a driver-adjustable level of steering assist to help prevent inadvertent lane departure when a vehicle approaches the edge of a lane and also provides steering wheel haptic vibration feedback.\nFor convenience and safety, a High-beam Assist (HBA) function is also available. When switched to automatic mode, it detects both oncoming vehicles and vehicles in the same lane ahead at night and changes to low-beam as appropriate, reducing blinding effects on other drivers. Whenever there are no vehicles detected, the system automatically re-activates the high beams, maximizing the driver's range of vision. To maximize driving visibility, Genesis offers HID headlights with dynamic auto-leveling that compensates for varying vehicle loads.\nTo help ensure maximum driver alertness, Genesis also benefits from a world-first technology in its CO2 sensor control system, located under the glove box. Hyundai engineers discovered that occupants start to get drowsy when CO2 levels reached more than 2,000 parts per million, so the ventilation system helps ensure the cabin maintains a CO2 concentration well below that level at all times using freshly-ventilated ambient air. The system monitors the vehicle's intake of fresh or re-circulated air using a dedicated CO2 sensor.\nThe Genesis also offers a parking assistance system with eight ultrasonic sensors located on the front and rear bumpers. The sensors, along with the rearview camera, help detect how close objects are when parking. Distance is indicated on the in-dash screen and accompanied by an audible warning tone.\nNVH REDUCTION\nIn pursuit of refined quietness within the Genesis cabin, Hyundai engineers analyzed idle noise and vibration, acceleration, road and wind noise, and audible booming throughout the bodyshell. Sound-absorbing materials and a low-noise fuel pump have been fitted, cowl bulkhead insulation and sealing improved, and vibrations minimized through an improvement in overall bodyshell rigidity. Insulation of the rear differential helps reduce booming and vibration, resulting in lower audible noise inside the Genesis passenger cabin.\nDuring acceleration, sound quality has been achieved through mid- to high-frequency noise reduction, and dynamic engine sound improvements were achieved through intake and exhaust system tuning.\nDRIVER CONVENIENCE TECHNOLOGIES\nMost Genesis competitors with hands-free trunk-opening technology use a leg-kick sensor under the rear bumper to enable the driver to open the trunk. Hyundai ergonomics engineers found this method to be difficult when an individual is carrying cumbersome packages, such as from shopping. So the Genesis Smart Trunk system was designed to open the trunk automatically if the smart key is detected in a pocket or purse within a few feet of the rear bumper for longer than three seconds, for maximum hands-free ease of opening when desired. This system allows the driver to keep both feet comfortably on the ground, simply waiting by the trunk a few seconds for it to open automatically. The Smart Trunk system also provides an audible warning and flashing light prior to opening.\nTaking inspiration from aircraft technology, an available Head's-Up Display (HUD) projects a virtual image onto the windshield, enabling the driver to keep his or her eyes on the road using a system of mirrors combined with a TFT LCD display. The system utilizes a wide screen with adjustable brightness to ensure both excellent daytime and nighttime visibility. Driving information such as speed, Smart Cruise Control status, navigation, Blind Spot Detection, Forward Collision Warning, speed limit, Lane Departure Warning and audio system data is projected at a perceived virtual distance approximately six feet ahead of the driver for maximum legibility while driving.\nGenesis also offers an electronic parking brake with Automatic Vehicle Hold for convenience when driving in traffic. Automatic Vehicle Hold automatically holds the Genesis at a stop until the accelerator pedal is depressed, such as at a traffic signal or in stopped traffic. The vehicle hold re-engages whenever the vehicle is brought to a complete stop. Genesis also includes proximity-key entry convenience with push-button start as standard equipment.\nMEDIA AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS\nFor audiophiles, Genesis offers an ultra-premium, Lexicon ® Discrete Logic 7 Surround audio system with 17 speakers, Logic 7 Surround Sound processing and 12-channel digital amplifier with 900-watts of equivalent output, sure to satisfy the most demanding listeners.
