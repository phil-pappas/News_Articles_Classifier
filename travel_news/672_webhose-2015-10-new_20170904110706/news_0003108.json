Rishi Khosla, chief executive officer of OakNorth Bank, says that while confidence may have returned to small business owners, many have ruled out borrowing because the major banks increasingly focused their relationship managers on large companies. He says: “A ‘computer says no’ approach to dealing with small businesses began to prevail and those that were offered loans were often required to secure them against their residential property, which is an unattractive option for many. Major banks actually killed much of the appetite for loans among small businesses because if you are told ‘no’ enough times, you simply stop asking “This problem pre-dates the financial crisis, but was exacerbated by it and the risk aversion that ensued. Major banks actually killed much of the appetite for loans among small businesses because if you are told ‘no’ enough times, you simply stop asking.” As a result, says Mr Khosla, “lending to small businesses is far lower in the UK than it is in the US and Germany where they have more competitive and diverse banking sectors.” For businesses larger than 250 employees, the picture is completely different. Nearly two-fifths (38pc) of larger businesses would choose private equity as their first port of call, followed by “other means”. Only 19pc said they would turn to a bank loan. Most businesses looking for finance look first at their bank but bank funding has become much harder to access Chief executives familiar with the situation say this marked difference is the result of poor awareness of financing options and a lack of availability of further cash from traditional sources. Jane Dumeresque, chief executive officer of peer-to-peer lender Folk2Folk, explains: “One of the current restraints for funding is finance houses rejecting good funding applications because they are in sectors where the growth curve is not steep enough for the investor; where that sector allocation is already complete; or where the borrower does not meet exact requirements, despite being a good lending opportunity. “Most businesses looking for finance look first at their bank but bank funding has become much harder to access. Where bank finance is not available businesses should consider higher rate alternative funding or share the rewards of their business with equity investors.” Priorities for business Staffing, marketing and acquiring additional facilities are the priorities for those new businesses that are seeking to invest, according to research from Bibby Financial Services. The report found that 24pc of UK businesses are seeking to invest in more facilities, while 23pc said more staff was the priority. People first: staff are high on the agenda Photo: Getty Advertising and marketing was a greater priority for businesses with fewer than 250 employees while rewarding staff was more of a priority for larger companies. Whether the business is large or small, technology remains the number one for investment over the coming year, however: 67pc of larger companies and 63pc of smaller companies said that this is where they will spend. Ragavan Sathanandan, of KPMG Small Business Accounting, says: “Many businesses will be concentrating their investments in technology and digital skill building, helping to bridge the gap between successful and unsuccessful firms and ensuring they’re keeping one step ahead of the competition.” Getting help Small businesses appear to be frustrated with the level of assistance from their local authorities, according to research from Bibby Financial Services. Around 17pc of the small businesses surveyed felt their local authority was not at all supportive, against 6pc of businesses with more than 250 employees. Deputy head of policy at the Institute of Directors (IoD), Jimmy McLoughlin says the government could do more to make small businesses aware of the assistance available. He says: “The IoD’s recent report Opening the Equity Economy calls on the government to unleash the potential of investment tax relief to make it easier and simpler for people across the country to invest in small- and mediumsized businesses. “If more businesses were aware of initiatives such as the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme, and more small-time investors knew how to use them, thousands more businesses could access the risk capital.” • To find out how you can unlock funding for growth, visit www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:57:42.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
