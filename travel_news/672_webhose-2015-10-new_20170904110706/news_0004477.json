Officials with the Wrightwood-based facility said besides readying the facility, they’ll also be hiring during a six-day job fair that begins Monday. “We’re already seeing how El Niño conditions will positively impact us this year,” said Mountain High Chief Marketing Officer McColly, in a company release. “Our team is absolutely stoked about the season ahead.” Colly said the first snow of the season is always exciting and fresh powder this early in October is not only a good sign, but a green-light in opening Mountain High at least two-weeks earlier than it’s traditional mid-November date. Officials from Mountain High said the snowfall on Oct. 5 was the earliest in recent memory. With snow coming from a large band of moisture that passed through Southern California. During the Mountain High Annual Job Fair, which runs through Saturday, the resort will look to fill several positions for the upcoming season. The ski resort consists of three separate mountains: West Resort, East Resort and North Resort. Mountain High offers a wide variety of lifts and trails, a world-class terrain park, an outstanding winter sports school and the region’s largest tubing area. Night skiing and snowboarding are available seven nights-a-week during peak season and snowmaking covers more than 80-percent of the slopes.
