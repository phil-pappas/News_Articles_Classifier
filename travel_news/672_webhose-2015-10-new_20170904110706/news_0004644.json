The demonstration highlights Broadcom , NXP and Realtek 100BASE-T1 physical layer transceivers (PHYs) working together in a single platform. The demonstration will take place at the 2015 OPEN all member meeting October 26 and the IEEE Ethernet & IP @ Automotive Tech Day, Booth #C3, October 27 – 28 in Yokohama, Japan .\nThe OPEN Alliance SIG was established in the fall of 2011. Since that time, OPEN members have worked tirelessly to enable interoperability in a multi-vendor environment, a key element for specification based development of communication technologies. The demonstration includes PHYs from Broadcom, NXP and Realtek communicating over OPEN Alliance compliant cable assemblies made by Delphi , Molex , TE Connectivity and Yazaki .\nThe demonstration, coordinated by the C&S Group , shows PHY and switch products interconnected using a variety of cables and inline-connectors in a switched architecture, simultaneously transferring HD video stream over the network.\n\"Today's interoperability demonstration reflects the hard work and commitment of the OPEN Alliance in establishing 100 Mbps BroadR-Reach® single pair automotive Ethernet technology as an open industry standard,\" said Natalie A. Wienckowski , Strategy Lead, Core Hardware Team at General Motors and Chair for the OPEN Alliance SIG. \"We are thrilled to share this major milestone at the annual IEEE Ethernet & IP @ Automotive Tech Day, the premier venue to learn about the evolution of Ethernet standards, technologies and applications in the automotive environment.\"\nAbout the Technology\nThe Open Alliance automotive Ethernet standard delivers high-performance bandwidth of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) per port while dramatically reducing connectivity costs and cabling weight. The fully automotive-qualified technology integrates specialized, separate systems into a centralized, secure platform, allowing multiple end points to simultaneously access and communicate information with a single protocol for data transfer.\nLeveraging the performance and cost advantages of the automotive-qualified technology, automakers can easily deploy advanced infotainment and driver assistance features, such as surround-view parking, lane-departure warning and collision avoidance systems, across a broader range of vehicles. Visit www.opensig.org for more information.\nThe OPEN Alliance has worked closely with IEEE in order to drive further innovation and standardization. The specification of a BroadR-Reach compliant IEEE standard is about to be finalized as IEEE 100BASE-T1 . The release of a next generation IEEE 1000BASE-T1 technology is expected in early 2016.\nAbout the OPEN Alliance SIG\nThe OPEN Alliance (One-Pair Ether-Net) Special Interest Group (SIG) is a non-profit, open industry alliance of mainly automotive industry and technology providers collaborating to encourage wide scale adoption of Ethernet-based networks as the standard in automotive networking applications. Since its inception, the OPEN Alliance SIG has surged to nearly 300 members strong.
