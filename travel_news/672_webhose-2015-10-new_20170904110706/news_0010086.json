This new call for action follows an earlier commitment from the industry to pursue a carbon-neutral growth pathway from 2020 and to cut CO2 emissions in half by 2050. The industry was the first global transport sector to develop a set of goals of limiting its CO2 emissions.\nAthar Husain Khan, AEA’s CEO and co-signer of the letter, says: “AEA’s member airlines take their environmental responsibility very seriously and are continuously decreasing their carbon emissions thanks to the investment in new aircraft technologies and by implementing new environmental friendly operational procedures. We are also discussing with policy-makers effective regulatory frameworks which will deliver further CO2 reductions. In particular, in cooperation with our industry partners in ATAG, we fully support ICAO’s crucial work on the global market-based measure. This global measure will complement the emissions reductions resulting from new technology, efficient infrastructure and operational improvements.”\nHe adds: “For many years, AEA has been promoting a global solution for a global issue such as aviation’s CO2 emissions. Such a solution must be simple and avoid distortions; by contrast, a European stand-alone solution such as the EU ETS for aviation has a negative impact on the competitiveness of European airlines. We call upon European decision-makers to address this issue in the context of the forthcoming Aviation Package.”\nSource:- AEA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:21:08.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
