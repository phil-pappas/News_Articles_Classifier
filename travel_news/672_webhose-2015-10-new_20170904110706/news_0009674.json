Mitrovic has already received 46 yellow cards and six reds in his career, despite only turning 21 last month and doubts about his temperament have quickly surfaced following a £12.7m summer move from Anderlecht. The Serbian international’s dismissal against Arsenal led to a three-game ban and came after he was fortunate to only be shown a yellow card for two wild tackles in the games against Swansea City and Southampton. But, having warned defenders he would kick them back if they kicked him shortly after signing for Newcastle, Mitrovic claims he has learnt his lesson. Mitrovic is shown a red card after a dangerous tackle against Arsenal “It has been a very difficult few weeks,” said Mitrovic, who made an impressively restrained return to the Newcastle team in the 2-2 draw against Chelsea last weekend . “It is always very difficult when you have to sit and watch a game, but you cannot help your team-mates. I am back now though, and I have learned a lot from the last few weeks. I will never do the same thing again. “Maybe it would have been different in other countries, but these are the rules and I know I cannot break them. I am sure I am not the first or last player to get a red card, but the rules are the rules here and I need to respect them. “I can control myself. I got the red card [against Arsenal], but I wanted to take the ball, I didn’t want to kick anybody. The striker was nearly sent off on hs debut “I don’t want to get any more red cards, and I am sure I can control myself to make sure that doesn’t happen. I know I can play smart for the whole of a game, and I think I showed that against Chelsea. Okay, I didn’t get a goal, but I still kept on working as hard as I could.” Chelsea’s players visibly tried to antagonise Mitrovic, with several niggly fouls on a player who arrived in this country with a wild man reputation and appeared intent on living up to it. • Newcastle and Steve McClaren have something to smile about And teams will continue to test the young forward’s self-control as they are well aware he struggles to control his emotions. “It’s very difficult when you get a lot of kicks from defenders, but you have to stay calm and think about how to score goals,” added Mitrovic. “They kick you all game, but that is my position and I have to deal with it. I need to keep working on the mental side of things, but I have shown I can deal with all of that.
