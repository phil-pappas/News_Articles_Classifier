Photographer's Note \n Arica - Between desert and ocean  In the north of Chile the desert touches the ocean. The few cities are clamped between both. This picture is taken in Arica on top of the Morro de Arica , a steep hill with a height of 139 meters above sea level. All along the Chilean coast undersea earthquakes and tsunamis occur. At the time of writing Chile had 9 earthquakes in the past 24 hours, 47 in the past 7 days, 315 in the past month and 588 in the past year. See http://earthquaketrack.com/p/chile/recent Last Wednesday an 8.3-magnitude earthquake struck off Chile's coast, with a startup of the tsunami alert and with coastal evacuations. At least three people were killed. \npapagolf21 , ikeharel has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T13:48:26.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
