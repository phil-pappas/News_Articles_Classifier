The report is a collection of climate action projects taking place throughout the civil aviation industry worldwide to reduce CO2 emissions.\nOf the 100 examples of climate actions cited in the report, three Bombardier initiatives related to its Q400 turboprop, C Series airliner and Challenger 350 business jet are featured:\nQ400 aircraft fuel efficiency manual : guide for airlines to maximize their operational and performance techniques, enabling them to generate significant fuel savings across all mission profiles and phases of flight; C Series family of aircraft : designed and purpose-built with efficiency in mind. The aircraft offer a 20% fuel burn advantage that translates directly into 20% CO 2 emissions advantage, exceptional operational flexibility, wide body comfort and an unmatched environmental and noise footprint; Challenger 350 business jet : compared to the previous Challenger 300 model, improvements in design and technology equate to approximately 10 tons of CO 2 saved per year over the lifetime of the aircraft.\n“Bombardier actively supports and contributes to the aviation industry’s climate change goals. We embed sustainability considerations at every stage by applying our product innovation lifecycle process – from design and manufacturing to end-of-life – as demonstrated by the three Bombardier examples in ATAG’s report,” said François Caza, Vice President, Bombardier Product Development and Chief Engineer, Aerospace.\n“Aviation plays a vital role in the global economy, providing connectivity for people and business. Our industry has also taken a lead in climate action, putting in place a comprehensive framework and goals to reduce emissions from air transport. The Aviation Climate Solutions are a set of case studies showing how different parts of the industry all over the world, including Bombardier, are working together to reduce our climate impact,” observed Michael Gill, Executive Director, ATAG.\nSource:- Bombardier", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:49:17.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
