Porcher Jr., Mary Arnette Edwards, Marvetta Daniels, Cecelia Fields, Gloria Barr Ford, Idris L. Harley, Alice DuPre Jordan, Dick Latham, Phoebe J. Williams, Amy Huddock, Roger West, Ross Magoulas, Trisha Gufstafson and Padgett Skardon. Susan Millar Williams has served as consultant and adviser. The one-hour performance is inspired by Part One of Michele Moore’s novel “The Cigar Factory,” to be published in February by Pat Conroy’s Story River Books, an imprint of the University of South Carolina Press. Tickets are free. Come early as seating is limited to 95, but overflow or late-arrivers will be able to hear the performance broadcast into the lobby. N. Charleston presents dinner and play North Charleston Dinner Theatre Series, organized by the Cultural Arts Department, presents “God’s Trombones: Seven Negro Poems in Verse” at 7 p.m. Nov. 6 at the Charleston Area Convention Center Ballroom. The event includes dinner. Tickets are $40 for dinner, the play and a gratuity; $10 tickets are available for those attending only the play. The program is based on the work of James Weldon Johnson and is a tribute to African-American culture and heritage. Johnson was an author, educator, lawyer, diplomat, songwriter and civil rights activist. In “God’s Trombones,” husband-and-wife team Ron and Natalie Daise bring Johnson’s 1927 volume of verse to life through music. The couple’s dramatic readings embody the energy, vitality, and culture of African-American religious oratory on which the author’s writings were patterned. To purchase tickets, contact Pam Smith at (843) 740-5847 by Nov. 3. Grace Church gets St. Martin sculpture Grace Episcopal Church will dedicate a life-size bronze sculpture of St. Martin of Tours on Nov. 8. The statue, made by Atlanta-based artist Tom Player, depicts St. Martin cutting his cavalry cloak for the benefit of a beggar in rags. That night, a vision of Jesus wearing the gifted cloak came to St. Martin saying as he had befriended the beggar, so also had he befriended Jesus. Grace Church’s rector, the Rev. Canon Michael Wright, commissioned the work because he wanted the theme of giving, shown in the story of the Good Samaritan in bronze relief on the doors of the church, to be extended into the adjacent courtyard. “I wanted to make the act of giving the cloak very personal and intimate,” Player said. The work is dedicated to the memory of church member Sandy Brown. Colour of Music poster unveiled The Colour of Music Festival poster for 2015 was unveiled this week. It features an image of a sculpture by local artist Fletcher Williams III. The piece is a treble clef filled with palmetto roses set against a pale blue background. Williams, who was featured in a March 21 Post and Courier article, is a young artist whose work reflects political and social issues. The Colour of Music Festival, now in its third year, celebrates the contributions of classically trained black musicians and composers. It ends with a 5 p.m. concert today at The Gaillard Center featuring a performance of the Brahms Requiem.
