Sam Brier, US-based meeting planner and winner of the Trinidad and Tobago booth prize - a miniature steel pan. \nMills also indicated that Trinidad and Tobago's participation at IMEX is part of an ongoing thrust to raise the profile of Trinidad and Tobago as a premier destination for Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE). \n\"Attending IMEX is also critical to the development of the Convention Bureau. The show provides an opportunity to obtain competitive intelligence on the MICE offerings from other Caribbean destinations as well as an avenue for the Bureau's staff to benefit from training and development offered by the Meeting Professionals International, the largest global trade association for the meeting industry,” Mills revealed. \nOver the three-day event, the Trinidad and Tobago team, which included representatives from the TTCB, a unit within the Tourism Development Company Limited, Tobago’s Shaw Park Complex and the Hyatt Regency Trinidad, hosted a series of one-on-one and group meetings with influential meeting planners. Meeting planners who booked appointments at the Trinidad and Tobago booth walked away with a reminder of the islands in the form of branded copper steel pan key chains and flash drives containing the recently updated Meeting Planners Guide. As an added bonus, one lucky booth visitor won a miniature steel pan. \nThis year’s event attracted 3,000 buyers from 54 countries, many originating from North America, Trinidad & Tobago’s main source market. \nFor more information on the services of the TTCB, please contact Arveon Mills, Sales Manager, Trinidad and Tobago Convention Bureau at email or 868–675–7034 or visit gotrinidadandtobago.com for more information. \nAbout Trinidad & Tobago \nHome to the largest Carnival celebration in the Caribbean, Trinidad & Tobago is the southernmost Caribbean nation located seven miles east off the Venezuelan coast.
