Their parents singing (CNN) Whether you're strapping lawn chairs between the seats to keep the kids from maiming each other or secretly fantasizing about that bottle of Chardonnay you're going to reward yourself with for enduring yet another round of \"The Lego Movie\" during the drive, road trips with the kids can be painful.
