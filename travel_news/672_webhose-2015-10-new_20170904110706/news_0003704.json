On the night of the full moon during the 12th lunar month, people would gather along riverbanks to float (“loy”) woven banana leaf baskets (“krathong”) containing candles, incenses and flowers, giving thanks to the goddess of the river for providing enough water to sustain their lives. Sometimes parted lovers would send their thoughts and wishes along with their krathong. \nAmari Phuket invites guests to celebrate this important festival with its special offering – the Loy Krathong Package, available for stays from 23 to 28 November 2015 .
