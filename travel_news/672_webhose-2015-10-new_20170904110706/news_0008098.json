Related Content Hurricane Patricia called 'potentially catastrophic' \nAbout 15,000 foreign and domestic tourists were moved to shelters in Jalisco state, said Jose Maria Tapia, director general of the National Disaster Prevention Center. The storm made landfall about 7:15 p.m., Mexico's National Water Commission said in a tweet. \nOne of the American tourists to hunker down in Puerto Vallarta was Brad Powles, who was vacationing with his partner of six years at the Grand Velas Riviera Nayarit. \nThey received a stark warning from hotel management about what to expect during the storm: \"Once in the shelter you are not anymore considered a guest. ... (S)ervices will be very basic,\" the hotel's note reads in part. \nHe went to the hotel shelter on the first floor and tweeted some of his experiences, saying the doors were locked and barred, which was unnerving but necessary. Later the hotel staff served dinner. He was inside the shelter when news came that the storm hit land south of Puerto Vallarta. \n\"Morale has improved in the shelter and not just because of dinner. Word is that #Patricia hit further south than expected...,\" he tweeted. \nEarlier he noted how the hotel prepared for the hurricane, tweeting \"And the hotel has thrown all the beach chairs into the pools to prevent them from blowing into us. #Patricia\" \nPowles said he was nervous but is trying to stay upbeat and keep his parents back home from worrying. \"Thank god for Wi-Fi,\" he said. \nOther hotel guests were evacuated from Puerto Vallarta to inland locations. \nCNN iReporter Louisa Valentin arrived in Mexico with her boyfriend on Wednesday to attend a Thursday wedding. On Friday, they were evacuated to Instituto Tepeyac Campus, a local school. \n\"We were instructed to only bring one small bag,\" she told CNN. \"The rest of our belongings we were told to leave inside our room in the closed bathroom area.\" \nThey didn't go hungry. Resort workers delivered lunch and snack items to the school, she said. \nAmerican Amera Bessa told CNN the storm caught her by surprise. \nShe was going out for dinner Thursday night when she learned the storm had become a Category 5 Hurricane, she said. On Friday morning, she and other guests rushed to the market for supplies. \nLater Friday, hotel managers summoned all the guests to the lobby and said they'd be evacuated to a nearby building considered safe because it was made of concrete, she said. Pool chairs were brought inside for people to sleep on and pillows and blankets were distributed, she said. \nSome sections of the building were air-conditioned but other parts were very uncomfortable. \"It was very claustrophobic because it was all boarded up,\" she said. \nJonathan Lake told CNN that he planned to ride out the storm in Puerto Vallarta, partly to watch his property and also to assist in the cleanup. The normally busy streets were empty, he said. \n\"It's like a ghost town,\" he said. \nOn Thursday, the Four Seasons Punta Mita transported guests to Guadalajara. \nHotel officials were preparing an underground shelter for staff and guests who are staying because they couldn't get a flight out, had nowhere to seek refuge or faced traffic jams that made it too difficult to find safety. \nAround midday Friday, \"we will start moving remaining guests and staff into designated shelter,\" said Thomas Citterio, director of marketing at the Punta Mita. \nAt the Bay View Grand Condo, guest Mark Sullivan snapped a photo of his view of boarded windows. He was evacuating to Guadalajara. \nAt the Comfort Inn in Puerto Vallarta, 200 guests are hunkering down in a designated safe room. \nHotel officials have boarded up windows and are communicating with authorities should they need to evacuate, said Samuel Ruic, the front desk manager. \nHotels have reached out to upcoming guests to postpone travel plans. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:57:52.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
