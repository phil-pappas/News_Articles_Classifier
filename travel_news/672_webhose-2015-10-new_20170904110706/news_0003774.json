He had been beaten and was unconscious, his mother posted on Facebook.\nThe mother of James Hubert, the missing Georgia Tech student found alive Monday morning, posted this photo of her son on her public Facebook page. “He’s awake,” she wrote. “Running lots of tests. Pray for speedy recovery.” (Credit: Facebook) Georgia Tech police Chief Robert Connolly credited “students for not giving up on their friend.”\nHubert, an aerospace engineering major from metro Atlanta and vice-president of Georgia Tech’s Phi Delta Theta fraternity, had last been seen around 11 p.m. Friday at an off-campus sorority party at The Foundry at Puritan Mill on Joseph E. Lowery Boulevard, Atlanta police said. Cell phone records showed that he was possibly in the area of DeKalb Avenue a couple of hours later.\n“The students rallied together and then they started searching,” Connolly told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “The students stayed out until midnight last night, putting out pamphlets and combing the area, anywhere they could possibly find [cell phone] pings along the route.”\nThe students “were not going to stop. They checked every hospital, every hotel, they checked everywhere,” Connolly said. “They didn’t give up on their friend.”\nThat doggedness paid off Monday morning, when Hubert was found battered, but alive, by a female student searching the area where Hubert’s cell phone had pinged.\nAtlanta police Lt. Charles Hampton described Hubert’s injuries as minor, adding that he was “not sure where those injuries came from.”\nHampton said that while investigators had not found any evidence of foul play, Hubert has not been coherent enough to tell detectives what happened.\n“Once he gets to a state that we can interview him, we will ask him more information to further our investigation,” he said.\nOn Facebook, Hubert’s mother posted “HE’S ALIVE,” on her page. “Please continue to pray for his speedy recovery. He’s in bad shape but alive.”\nShe later posted a photo from Grady that showed her son with a bruised eye and other facial injuries.\n— Staff photographer John Spink contributed to this article.\nTrending on Facebook\nHalf-eaten fish comes back to life, jumps on plate Kidnap victim uses Google to save himself Must read: Dad takes tardiness excuses to the next level Recall Alert: Mislabeled acetaminophen could lead to liver failure Woman's body hanging from fence mistaken for Halloween decoration More popular and trending stories\n</p", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/19/b8/1b/12065489_10206340296400651_7246906786573799991_n_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:01:48.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
