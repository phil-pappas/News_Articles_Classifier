China Daily asked several analysts for their views on the economy and Mr Xi’s remarks. Dennis Pamlin, Founder of 21st Century Frontiers in Sweden China still wants to be the economic engine of the world. What’s important to ensure is that this growth is not linked to increased environmental destruction, carbon emissions and inequity. Hopefully President Xi will clarify this, as the current trends are unsustainable. Dramatic carbon reductions are needed worldwide and for this to happen increased trade in low-carbon solutions is needed. The United States and the European Union must reduce protectionism and allow Chinese solutions better access. At the same time China’s domestic market also needs reform to accelerate more than incremental improvement. Fredrik Erixon, European Centre Director for International Political Economy in Brussels and a former adviser to the Swedish prime minister While there is turbulence in the Chinese economy, the main message is that growth is being maintained and that there is no reason to be alarmist. My reading of President Xi’s message is that the slowdown will continue and that the government is trying to change its growth model to an innovation-led strategy. China’s reform is continuing and the government is fighting many battles to push through reforms. It’s important that these reforms are done so China can continue enjoying high growth. Shada Islam, Policy director with the Friends of Europe think tank in Brussels It’s difficult at the moment to gauge exactly what is happening, or what will happen, in the Chinese economy and growth. It was reassuring to hear President Xi’s comments because it means he will do his utmost to ensure growth rates remain buoyant and that China knows how important its economic policies are for the rest of the world. The message is an important one after the recent market turmoil and was one that the world was anxious to hear. China’s partners want President Xi to press on with the promised economic reforms and are seeking reassurances that this will happen. The message is not dissimilar to what the Chancellor George Osborne said during his recent trip to China, namely that even if the Chinese economy slows down it would still be a massive source of growth in the coming years. It is also what the International Monetary Fund is urging when it says further structural reforms will be needed to make the Chinese economy more open. Luigi Gambardella , President of ChinaEU and an executive with the European Telecommunications Network Operators’ Association President Xi has expressed confidence in the future of the Chinese economy, which indeed is not declining but is growing at a slower pace. We should not forget that China is contributing to about 30 per cent of global economic growth and it remains one of the major markets for many US companies. Mr Xi also mentioned that “as of August 65,000 US businesses were in China investing a total of $76 billion”. I believe the potential for foreign companies investing in China will only grow despite China’s ambition to become a global investor. It needs to remain open to foreign ideas to turn into a global innovation power. In China, extreme competition exists side by side with state control in certain sectors. China wants to boost innovation yet the existing intellectual property framework is not sophisticated enough to ensure the flourishing of innovative products and ideas. But the leadership knows where to go. It knows that without reforming and further opening up the economy China will encounter big problems. I’m confident that China is committed to establishing more open and transparent market rules to improve intellectual property protection and market access for foreign companies. The ongoing negotiations for the US-China bilateral investment treaty, coupled with discussions on the EU-China bilateral investment treaty, are a good sign of this commitment. Christopher Bovis, Professor of international and European business law with Hull University Business School The Chinese economy and its growth pattern represent a prelude to the world economic performance in terms of future demand for products and services. The biggest challenge for this decade is to maintain a sustainable economic growth performance amid uncertainty over energy prices. The biggest obstacle in China’s continuous reform agenda since joining the World Trade Organization is reciprocal market access. The Chinese economy represents one of the most comprehensive markets in the world and the US wishes to have better access and enhanced opportunities in certain strategic sectors, such as energy, defence, utilities and infrastructure. Peter van Tuijl , Executive director of Secretariat of the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict’s GPPAC Foundation The Chinese government is committed to lifting China further out of poverty into prosperity. The implication is a growing equality in the balance of power between China and the US. The other important implication for China is that it will have to address the quality of growth within a global scope such as by addressing environmental issues, trans-national crime and violent extremism. This is where China and the US have a lot to gain in greater collaboration. The definition of “speed” and “reform” can be different. The difficulty for the Chinese government is that if it wants to maintain the momentum of reform it needs to allow greater space for individual initiative, civil society and entrepreneurship and to the decreased role of government. Wei Jianguo , Vice-chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges China is entering the most difficult phase of economic restructuring reform, with the traditional driving forces weakening and new engines growing. As the export- and investmentdriven model shifts to a service- and consumption-oriented model, the macroeconomic indicators may not be as strong as before. However, the transformation will change the quality of the growth in the long run and policy measures will sufficiently prevent a hard landing. The government plans to prevent any unexpected slowdown or systemic risks with supportive monetary and fiscal policies. A moderate rebound is expected in the fourth quarter. Domestic consumption is the key to offset the sharp decline in exports this year, with global demand remaining weak. So far, we have seen strong growth momentum in domestic consumption, especially in e-commerce. The National Development and Reform Commission will also urge enterprises to invest in high-quality projects such as the high-speed rail and to stimulate fixed-asset investment in the second half of this year. Economic reforms will continue despite temporary difficulties to let the market be decisive in the allocation of resources. Wang Jun , Analyst with the China Center for International Economic Exchanges President Xi undoubtedly demonstrated China’s unwavering resolve in pushing ahead with reform no matter the short-term volatility. In terms of implementing specific reforms it’s still too early to make a conclusion on the progress because there is a long way to go before 2020. The short-term slowdown strengthened the case for reform because many initiatives are actually positive for stabilising growth. It is critical now to accelerate initiatives that will have an immediate effect on growth. President Xi was blunt in talking about the problems we have come across, particularly issues that have raised widespread international concern. The frank discussion on these topics, such as the stock market and foreign exchange market, actually showed the nation’s confidence in navigating these issues. The international media have overplayed the risks of China’s slowdown. They have focused on short-term economic data and drawn an overly pessimistic picture. China’s slowdown did add some pressure on the global economy, especially in commodity prices given that China has been the major source of demand, but one should note that the decline in commodity prices and the deflationary pressure were not driven by China alone. Weak demand in developed countries also contributed. Wang Zihong , Senior researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences’ Institute of American Studies Some economists have expressed concern over China’s economic growth amid slower investment and excess capacity but I don’t think growth rates should be seen as the most pressing priority. Many countries have experienced economic slowdowns or even depressions. These are normal economic phenomena. More adjustments are needed for a future healthier growth. There are many so-called ghost cities and these projects should either be sold at a reduced price or be auctioned off, yet nothing has happened because they still gain support from banks. The Chinese economy has entered a stage that requires more emphasis on structural adjustments and sustainable growth, not indicators. China has become the world’s second-largest economy, a position previously held by Germany and Japan, which at the time were higher in the global supply chain than China is now. • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:36:35.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
