(NYSE:LUV) (the \"Company\") today reported its third quarter 2015 results:\nRecord third quarter net income, excluding special items 1 , of $623 million , or $.94 per diluted share. This represented a $241 million increase from third quarter 2014 and exceeded the Thomson Reuters First Call mean estimate of $.92 per diluted share. Record third quarter GAAP 2 net income of $584 million , or $.88 per diluted share, compared with third quarter 2014 GAAP net income of $329 million . Record quarterly GAAP operating income of $1.2 billion . Excluding special items, record third quarter operating income of $1.0 billion , resulting in an operating margin 3 of 20.3 percent. Returned $549 million to Shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during third quarter 2015, and $1.4 billion during the first nine months of 2015. Return on invested capital, before taxes and excluding special items (ROIC) 1 , for the 12 months ended September 30, 2015, of 31.1 percent, compared with 19.0 percent for the 12 months ended September 30, 2014. Gary C. Kelly , Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We are very pleased to report outstanding third quarter 2015 results marked by a 63.1 percent year-over-year increase in net income, excluding special items. Our record third quarter operating income, excluding special items, of $1.0 billion produced a strong 20.3 percent operating margin, which is a 680 basis point improvement from the year-ago period. The significant margin expansion was driven largely by lower fuel prices. Our results also benefited from a continued focus on cost control and solid overall revenue performance, including a significant contribution from our Rapid Rewards program. Customer demand for our low fares was evident with an all-time quarterly record load factor of 85.4 percent for third quarter 2015. That's what low fares without 'gotcha's', which we call Trans fare ncy SM , will do for you. My thanks to our superb Employees for producing our tenth consecutive quarter of record profits and my congratulations to them on their record $484 million profitsharing accrual, thus far this year.\n\"We are pleased with our third quarter 2015 unit revenue (RASM) performance, considering the longer average stage length, higher average seats per trip (gauge), and softer yield environment. Third quarter 2015 operating revenues grew 10.8 percent to a record $5.3 billion on a year-over-year increase in available seat miles of 7.6 percent. Our third quarter 2015 operating revenues reflected a benefit of approximately $300 million from our July 2015 amended agreement with Chase Bank USA , N.A. (Chase), including a required change in accounting treatment. This benefit includes a one-time non-cash increase to operating revenues of $172 million , which was recorded as a special revenue adjustment. Total operating revenues, excluding this special item 4 , increased 7.2 percent to $5.1 billion , and decreased slightly on a unit basis, both as compared with third quarter 2014. Based on favorable booking and revenue trends thus far in October, and including the ongoing benefit to operating revenues from our amended Chase agreement (estimated to be approximately $130 million for fourth quarter 2015), we are currently expecting an increase to fourth quarter 2015 unit revenue of approximately one percent, year-over-year.\n\"Our favorable third quarter 2015 cost trends and outlook for fourth quarter 2015 costs reflect significantly lower jet fuel prices and ongoing fleet modernization benefits. Our third quarter 2015 economic fuel costs 1 declined nearly $300 million , year-over-year. Based on our existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of October 19, 2015, we currently expect full year 2015 economic fuel costs to decline approximately $1.3 billion , year-over-year.\n\"We are very pleased with the strength of our network, especially considering our uncharacteristically high percentage of markets under development. Our new Dallas markets, in particular, continue to perform exceptionally well, including the eight new markets launched in August 2015 . We reached an exciting milestone in our international expansion last week with the opening of a new five-gate concourse, along with a Federal Inspection Station for Customs and Border Protection, at Houston's William P. Hobby Airport. We began service between Houston Hobby and San Jose, Costa Rica ; Cancun, Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta , and San Jose del Cabo/ Los Cabos, Mexico ; and our inaugural service to our 96 th city, Belize City, Belize . In addition, we are offering seasonal Saturday service to San Juan, Puerto Rico , and Oranjestad, Aruba . Next month, we will begin service from Houston to Montego Bay, Jamaica , and our inaugural service to Liberia , Costa Rica , subject to foreign government approval. That will bring us to ten nonstop destinations across Latin America and the Caribbean for Southwest Customers out of Houston Hobby .\n\"In addition to producing strong margins and record earnings, our investment grade balance sheet, liquidity, and cash flow remain strong. Our cash and short-term investments were $3.1 billion at the end of third quarter 2015. Thus far this year, we have generated free cash flow 1 of $1.6 billion . We have returned $1.4 billion to Shareholders through the payment of $180 million in dividends and the repurchase of $1.2 billion in common stock so far this year, reflecting our ongoing commitment to enhance long-term value for our Shareholders.\"\nFinancial Results\nThe Company's third quarter 2015 total operating revenues were a record $5.3 billion , a 10.8 percent increase compared with third quarter 2014, largely driven by third quarter 2015 passenger revenues of $4.7 billion . In addition, as described in more detail below, the Company recorded a special revenue adjustment during third quarter 2015 of $172 million related to its amended agreement with Chase. Other revenues for third quarter 2015 increased 102.1 percent year-over-year, largely due to the amended agreement with Chase and the resulting change in accounting methodology.\nThe Company executed an amended co-branded credit card agreement with Chase during third quarter 2015, through which the Company sells loyalty points and other items to Chase. For accounting purposes, the amended agreement materially modified the previously existing agreement between Chase and the Company and is subject to Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, \"Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force\" (ASU 2009-13). Under the transition provisions of ASU 2009-13, the existing deferred revenue liability at the date of the amended agreement was reduced to reflect the estimated selling price of the undelivered element (air transportation) of the contract. As a result, the Company recorded a one-time non-cash adjustment of $172 million that increased revenue, which was classified as a special item and excluded from the Company's third quarter 2015 reported RASM. In addition, the combined impact of the amended agreement and the effect of the resulting change in accounting methodology benefited third quarter 2015 total operating revenues by approximately $130 million , the impact of which was included in third quarter 2015 RASM. This $130 million benefit reflects a $170 million increase to other revenues offset by a $40 million reduction to passenger revenues. An estimated fourth quarter total operating revenue benefit of approximately $130 million is included in the Company's current outlook for a fourth quarter 2015 RASM increase of approximately one percent, year-over-year.\nTotal operating expenses in third quarter 2015 decreased 2.2 percent to $4.1 billion , compared with third quarter 2014. During third quarter 2015, the Company expensed $140 million (before profitsharing expense and taxes) related to the proposed ratification bonuses included in the tentative collective-bargaining agreement recently reached with the Company's Pilots, which is a special item. Excluding special items in both periods, total operating expenses in third quarter 2015 decreased 1.3 percent to $4.1 billion , compared with third quarter 2014.\nThird quarter 2015 economic fuel costs were $2.20 per gallon, including $.50 per gallon in unfavorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts, compared with $2.94 per gallon in third quarter 2014, including $.05 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts. Based on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of October 19, 2015, fourth quarter 2015 economic fuel costs are estimated to be in the $2.05 to $2.10 per gallon range, as compared with fourth quarter 2014's $2.62 per gallon. As of October 19, 2015, the fair market value of the Company's fuel derivative contracts was a net liability of approximately $1.2 billion for the fuel hedge portfolio through 2018, including a $116 million net liability related to the remainder of 2015. Additional information regarding the Company's fuel derivative contracts is included in the accompanying tables.\nExcluding fuel and oil expense and special items in both periods, third quarter 2015 operating costs increased 8.4 percent from third quarter 2014, partially due to the third quarter 2015 profitsharing expense of $177 million , compared with $100 million in third quarter 2014. Excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing expense, third quarter 2015 operating costs increased 5.9 percent from third quarter 2014, and decreased 1.6 percent on a unit basis. Based on current trends and excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing expense, the Company currently expects fourth quarter 2015 unit costs to be comparable to fourth quarter 2014. This fourth quarter cost outlook includes the estimated impact of the tentative collective-bargaining agreement recently reached with the Company's Pilots.\nOperating income in third quarter 2015 was a record $1.2 billion , compared with $614 million in third quarter 2014. Excluding special items, operating income was a third quarter record $1.0 billion in third quarter 2015, compared with $649 million in third quarter 2014.\nOther expenses in third quarter 2015 were $292 million , compared with $89 million in third quarter 2014. The $203 million increase primarily resulted from $272 million in other losses recognized in third quarter 2015, compared with $66 million in third quarter 2014. In both periods, these losses included ineffectiveness and unrealized mark-to-market amounts associated with a portion of the Company's fuel hedge portfolio, which are special items. Excluding these special items, third quarter 2015 had $33 million in other losses, compared with $16 million in third quarter 2014, primarily attributable to the premium costs associated with the Company's fuel derivative contracts. Fourth quarter 2015 premium costs related to fuel derivative contracts are currently estimated to be in the $40 million to $45 million range, compared with $13 million in fourth quarter 2014. Net interest expense in third quarter 2015 was $20 million , compared with $23 million in third quarter 2014.\nThird quarter 2015 net income was $584 million , or $.88 per diluted share, which included $39 million (net) of unfavorable special items, compared with third quarter 2014 net income of $329 million , or $.48 per diluted share, which included $53 million (net) of unfavorable special items. Excluding special items, third quarter 2015 net income was $623 million , or $.94 per diluted share, compared with third quarter 2014 net income, excluding special items, of $382 million , or $.55 per diluted share.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , total operating revenues increased 6.2 percent to $14.8 billion , while total operating expenses decreased 5.0 percent to $11.8 billion , resulting in operating income of $3.1 billion , compared with $1.6 billion for the same period last year. Excluding special items, operating income was $3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , compared with $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 .\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , was $1.6 billion , or $2.45 per diluted share, compared with $946 million , or $1.36 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Excluding special items, net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $1.8 billion , or $2.63 per diluted share, compared with $993 million , or $1.42 per diluted share, for the same period last year.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flows\nAs of September 30, 2015 , the Company had approximately $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, and a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion . Net cash provided by operations during third quarter 2015 was $836 million , capital expenditures were $230 million , and assets constructed for others, net of reimbursements, were $23 million , resulting in free cash flow of $583 million . The Company repaid $79 million in debt and capital lease obligations during third quarter 2015, and intends to repay approximately $40 million in debt and capital lease obligations during the remainder of 2015. The Company funded its ProfitSharing Plan during second quarter 2015 associated with its 2014 results. In past years, the Company's annual profitsharing contribution was funded during third quarter, including $228 million funded in third quarter 2014.\nDuring third quarter 2015, the Company returned $549 million to its Shareholders through the payment of $49 million in dividends and the repurchase of $500 million in common stock. Under the existing $1.5 billion share repurchase program, the Company repurchased $500 million in common stock during third quarter 2015 pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program launched during the quarter (third quarter 2015 ASR program), and received approximately 9.7 million shares, representing an estimated 75 percent of the shares expected to be repurchased. The Company expects to complete the third quarter 2015 ASR program by the end of this month. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015 , free cash flow was a strong $1.6 billion which enabled the Company to return $1.4 billion to Shareholders through the payment of $180 million in dividends and the repurchase of $1.2 billion in common stock. The Company has $700 million remaining under its existing $1.5 billion share repurchase program.\nFleet and Capacity\nDuring third quarter 2015, the Company received three pre-owned Boeing 737-700s to end the quarter with 692 aircraft. The Company continues to manage to approximately 700 aircraft at year-end 2015 and continues to expect to grow its fleet approximately two percent, year-over-year, in 2016. Additional information regarding the Company's aircraft delivery schedule is included in the accompanying tables. The Company's capacity plans remain unchanged with expected available seat mile growth of approximately seven percent this year, and an estimated five to six percent in 2016, both year-over-year.\nAwards and Recognitions\nNamed one of Best Companies for Work-Life Balance by Forbes Named a Top 50 Employer by Workforce Diversity for Engineering & IT Professionals Magazine Ranked among Best Airline Rewards Programs by U.S. News & World Report Outsmart Magazine's Best Airline Conference Call\nThe Company will discuss its third quarter 2015 results on a conference call at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time today.

These GAAP financial statements include (i) unrealized non-cash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance.\nAs a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information, including results that it refers to as \"economic,\" which the Company's management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The Company's economic financial results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts–all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the Company's actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of Other (gains) losses, net, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. The Company believes these economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the Company's fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, non-cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company's management, as well as investors, to consistently assess the Company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nFurther information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 .\nIn addition to its \"economic\" financial measures, as defined above, the Company has also provided other non-GAAP financial measures, including results that it refers to as \"excluding special items,\" as a result of items that the Company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations. These include a one-time special revenue adjustment due to the July 2015 amended co-branded credit card agreement with Chase and the resulting change in accounting methodology, expenses associated with the Company's acquisition and integration of AirTran, a gain resulting from a litigation settlement received in January 2015 , and collective bargaining ratification bonuses for certain workgroups. The Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items in order to evaluate the results on a comparative basis with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods. As a result of the Company's acquisition of AirTran, which closed on May 2, 2011 , the Company has incurred substantial charges associated with integration of the two companies. Given that the AirTran integration process has been effectively completed, the Company does not anticipate significant future integration expenditure requirements, but may incur smaller incremental costs associated primarily with the continuing conversion and sublease of the Boeing 717 fleet throughout 2015. While the Company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges, it does expect to treat the charges as special items in its future presentation of non-GAAP results.\nThe Company has also provided free cash flow and ROIC, which are non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes free cash flow is a meaningful measure because it demonstrates the Company's ability to service its debt, pay dividends and make investments to enhance Shareholder value. Although free cash flow is commonly used as a measure of liquidity, definitions of free cash flow may differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for free cash flow. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company generated $583 million in free cash flow, calculated as operating cash flows of $836 million less capital expenditures of $230 million less assets constructed for others of $32 million plus reimbursements for assets constructed for others of $9 million.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company generated $1.6 billion in free cash flow, calculated as operating cash flows of $2.9 billion less capital expenditures of $1.2 billion less assets constructed for others of $76 million plus reimbursements for assets constructed for others of $14 million.\nThe Company believes ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how well the Company generates operating income relative to the capital it has invested in its business. Although ROIC is commonly used as a measure of capital efficiency, definitions of ROIC may differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for ROIC in the accompanying reconciliation tables to the press release (See Return on Invested Capital).\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/southwest-airlines-reports-record-third-quarter-profit-300164565.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/southwest-airlines-reports-record-third-quarter-profit-300164565.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DA35398&Transmission_Id=201510220630PR_NEWS_USPR_____DA35398&DateId=20151022", "http://southwest.investorroom.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:33:28.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
