It’s utterly intoxicating.\nThis isn’t Storme’s usual beat – she’s more Lady Gaga than Fats Waller. But in the BBC crime series New Tricks, her character, Holly Griffiths, is a jazz fan, so we’ve come to New Orleans for some inspiration.\nStriking the right note: A band on the streets of New Orleans in Louisiana, U.S.\nWe began our musical journey on a walking tour around the French Quarter.\nFirst, our guide Milton gave us a lesson in how to talk like a local. New Orleans is pronounced as one long, slow, slurred word – Nawleens. And everyone calls you ‘baby’.\nThe city is a heady mix of Creole and Cajun, black and white, the privileged and dispossessed, which lent jazz its unique sound.\n 2 Next From restaurant to runway: Hungry passengers can now order... Stunning architecture... and the cocktails are... The magical moment a pod of humpback whales swim beneath the... Don't look down: Daredevil photographer captures London's... Sleep on a budget, enjoy the bustling nightlife and indulge... Strolling past the bars of Bourbon Street down to Jackson Square on the Mississippi riverfront was like walking through a never-ending open-air concert.\nThe sounds of the horse-drawn carriages’ squeaky wooden wheels and trotting hooves were percussion for the improvised bands stationed on each street corner.\nMusic was happening inside every property too: a trumpet’s blast from Basin Street bars, the tinkling of chandeliers from the opulent antique stores in Royal Street, and a long slow note from a trombone from behind the painted wooden shutters of a plantation house.\nGiddy up: Carriage tours are a popular way to visit the French Quarter, New Orleans, Louisiana\nJumping into a taxi, jazz from one of the local radio stations was blaring out. Our driver asked: ‘Do you like jazz?’ Then, without waiting for an answer, he added: ‘Of course! Everyone does!’\nStorme didn’t. She wasn’t keen on going to Preservation Hall, dedicated to preserving traditional jazz since 1961, but Milton persuaded her by explaining that in the 1920s, jazz was the sound of youth – parents and newspapers were up in arms at this new-fangled music. In Nawleens, Milton said, it’s not just old guys blowing their own trumpets – cool kids do it too.\nThere weren’t any kids playing during our visit to Preservation Hall but the music, tinged with sadness, stole our hearts nonetheless.\nThat night they played the same sad tunes in Arnaud’s, a lovely, luscious restaurant with its own Petit Theatre attached. The jazz trio serenaded Storme with What A Wonderful World, and I watched as her anti-jazz heart melted.\nWe spent our final night at the Spotted Cat. As we headed back to our accommodation, a dozen young men in hoodies, bobble hats and thick fleece jogging pants were outside giving their all on clarinet, trumpets, saxophone and tuba.\nAfter a week in New Orleans, Storme was into a whole new groove. The city had made her fall in love with jazz.\nTRAVEL FACTS America As You Like It ( americaasyoulikeit.com , 020 8742 8299) offers a nine-night fly-drive package to Louisiana and Mississippi from £1,029 per adult and £685 per child including return flights on US Airways from Heathrow to New Orleans, car hire and accommodation.\nRead more: America As You Like It: Welcome", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1R4zmPg", "http://americaasyoulikeit.com/"], "published": "2015-10-11T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:57:13.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
