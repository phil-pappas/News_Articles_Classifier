In Long Beach , passenger embarkations rose 84 percent to 549,000 passengers. Embarkations in Los Angeles grew 36 percent to 291,000 passengers and San Francisco embarkations grew 30 percent to 95,000 passengers.\nCruise Passenger and Crew Spending in California\nAccording to CLIA's study, cruising at California ports generated two million passenger and crew visits, representing 8.6 percent of all passenger and crew visits in the U.S. and producing $132 million in passenger and crew onshore spending, or nearly $65 per visit. Total passenger and crew spending in California increased 39 percent from 2013.\n2014 CLIA Economic Impact Analysis\nCALIFORNIA\nTotals\nShare of the U.S. (percent)\nPassenger Embarkations\n984,000\n8.9\nResident Cruise Passengers\n1,245,000\n11.1\nTotal Passenger & Crew Visits\n2,011,00\n8.6\nDirect Expenditures ($ Millions)\n$2,222\n10.6\nTotal Employment Impact\n44,369\n11.9\nTotal Wage Impact ($ Millions)\n$2,732\n14.1\nAdditional findings from CLIA's study:\nThe cruise industry directly employed approximately 1,300 Californians, representing approximately five percent of the total employment of all cruise lines throughout the U.S. Tourism-related industries received approximately $700 million , or 32 percent of the cruise industry's $2.2 billion in direct spending in California .
