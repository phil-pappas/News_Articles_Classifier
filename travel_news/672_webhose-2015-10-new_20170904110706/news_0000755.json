The list, produced every year since 2004, ranks Britain's top 250 mid-market private companies by their turnover over the previous year, from published accounts. \nAir Charter Service first appeared in the league table in 2011 at number 158 after previously being earmarked ‘One To Watch’ two years earlier. Chairman Chris Leach commented: “In the year of our 25th anniversary this placing is recognition of our hard work and continued growth over the past few years, and we are delighted with our position.” Last year sales grew by 14% to £286.1 million, and further growth is expected again this year, following hugely encouraging half year results. 2015’s list contains household names such as Aston Martin, Pret A Manger and Liverpool FC. The 250 companies named have a total revenue of £69 billion, and make up more than 4% of the UK’s GDP.
