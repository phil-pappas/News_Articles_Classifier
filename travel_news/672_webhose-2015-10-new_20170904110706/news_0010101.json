The new CO2 Standard is being developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO’s) Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), in cooperation with 600 experts from government, civil society and industry.\nThe ICAO project has been included as part of the publication Aviation Climate Solutions, a collection of 100 such examples of how the aviation sector is collaborating to cut carbon dioxide emissions and help reduce its impact on climate change.\nDr. Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, President of the ICAO Council, stressed that “The steady growth of the air transport sector is very positive, given that it represents a clear validation of the importance of safe and reliable civil aviation services to the social and economic vitality of travellers, businesses, and ultimately States. But in an era of climate change and, increasingly, climate action, the growth of any industry sector brings with it a number of critical concerns, and certainly the need for strong and practical commitments. ICAO States are making progress on many related objectives and measures and we are pleased that the CO2 Standard for Aircraft has been highlighted in the context of this new ATAG publication.”\nMichael Gill, Executive Director of the Air Transport Action Group, the cross-industry association responsible for the publication, said “Aviation plays a vital role in the world economy, providing connectivity for people and business. Our industry has also taken a lead in climate action, putting in place a comprehensive framework and goals to reduce emissions from air transport. Aviation Climate Solutions presents a series of case studies showing how different parts of the sector all over the world, including governments, are working together today to reduce our climate impact.”\nAviation Climate Solutions was released at the Global Sustainable Aviation Summit in Geneva, Switzerland, alongside an open letter from industry chief executives which reaffirms the industry’s commitment to climate action; and calls on governments to support it with the development of a global market-based measure for aviation emissions, improved efficiency in air traffic management and accelerating research for alternative fuels and new technology.\nAt the 37th ICAO Assembly in October 2010, governments resolved to achieve collective global aspirational goals for international aviation, including improving fuel efficiency by 2 per cent per year and keeping net CO2 emissions from 2020 at the same levels. These were reaffirmed by the 38th ICAO Assembly in 2013, where governments also agreed to work further to explore the feasibility of a long-term global goal and the design of a global MBM for international aviation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:11:25.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
