(Busch Gardens / Universal Orlando) Battle of scares: Universal's Halloween Horror Nights goes toe-to-toe with Howl-O-Scream at Busch Gardens \nIt's easy to take living in the \"Theme Park Capital of the World\" for granted. \nBefore moving to Florida from Atlanta four years ago, my Halloween haunted house options were limited -- ranging from higher-end productions in rented out warehouses to mom-and-pop operations which relied heavily on strobe lights and masked men with chainsaws. \nHere in Central Florida we have two of the largest, most elaborate Halloween scare events in the country. Events that, while seasonal, are hosted by major theme parks and offer experiences that few other fright fans can get elsewhere. \nI'm talking of course about Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Orlando and Howl-O-Scream at Busch Gardens Tampa. Caption Universal marks 25th Halloween Horror Nights \nIt's the silver anniversary for Universal's Halloween Horror Nights, and that's appropriate because the event has been giving guests gray hairs for much of that time. \nIt's the silver anniversary for Universal's Halloween Horror Nights, and that's appropriate because the event has been giving guests gray hairs for much of that time. Caption Orlando News Now: Halloween Horror Nights begins \nUniversal's Halloween Horror Nights begins tonight. \nUniversal's Halloween Horror Nights begins tonight. \nBut which one is better? As usual, it depends who you asked. When I lived and worked in the Tampa area, many preferred Howl-O-Scream, while others made the trek up I-4 for HHN. \nSince I've been in Orlando, I've found less people willing to make the drive down to Busch Gardens when HHN is practically in their backyard. \nMakes sense, but convenience doesn't always equal better. And with gas prices around $2 a gallon, the 80ish-mile drive doesn't factor in as much as it did, say, a year ago. \nSo who wins in the battle of frights? I checked out both events on their respective opening nights. Here's my take, broken down into a few main categories. \nBy the numbers: HHN features a record nine haunted mazes in 2015, along with five scare zones. HOS has seven houses and no designated scare areas, but there are costumed actors throughout the park, along with props and plenty of fog machines. HHN has its staple Bill & Ted show, along with the new \"The Carnage Returns,\" featuring the return of Jack the Clown. HOS only has one show (\"Fiends\"). More on show comparisons later. When it comes to price, general admission is steep for both -- $101.99 for HHN and $90 for HOS -- but a variety of discounts can get both of those in the $40 range on select nights. Winner = Halloween Horror Nights \nPhotos from Halloween Horror Nights 25 at Universal Orlando. For its 25th anniversary, the annual event features a record nine haunted houses, in addition to scare zones and live shows. \nOriginality: HHN has become all about the big name properties in the horror genre. Sure, houses based on franchises like \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Insidious\" create a buzz. Those are usually the ones with the longest lines, but branding doesn't always equal scary. My favorite house at HHN this year was \"Jack Presents 25 Years of Monsters and Mayhem,\" an homage to the event's 25 years of monsters, maniacs and original ideas. \nFive of the nine HHN mazes are based on franchises. Now I'm a fan of those franchises, but at the end of the day, zombies are zombies and knife-wielding crazies can creep someone out even if they're not based on a movie or TV series. \nWhat HOS lacks in big name draw it makes up for in originality. All seven houses are original concepts, including the new \"Unearthed: Scarlett's Revenge,\" which comes from the mind of Robin Cowie , the producer of \"The Blair Witch Project.\" Busch Gardens even released a series of videos promoting the new house . \nThe zoo-like setting of Busch Gardens also adds to many of its houses, like\"Dead Fall\" (blood-thirsty plants) and \"Death Water Bayou\" (crazy Cajuns in a swamp-like backdrop.) Winner = Howl-O-Scream \nScenes from Howl-O-Scream 2015 at Busch Gardens Tampa. The annual Halloween event runs select nights through Oct. 31. \nComing at you in 3D: Both events feature a house uses 3D glasses to enhance -- or detract from -- the experience. HHN's \"Asylum in Wonderland 3D\" wins here, but not by much. HOS has \"Circus of Superstition: The Last Laugh.\" \nThe former features creepy bunnies while the latter has clowns, but both feature plenty of neon 3D imagery that is more nauseating than scary. Winner = Halloween Horror Nights \nAll about the scares: Let's be honest, if you go to events like these, you're going to be scared...or at least startled. I felt like HOS did a better job of this. Maybe it was the actors on sling shot bungees coming out of nowhere or the smaller crowds that allowed you to experience the houses in a more organic way. \nOr perhaps it was the fact that there wasn't noncostumed employees at every corner giving you the \"move it along\" wave. I get safety precautions, but that really took away from the experience at Universal. And again, theming a house after a movie or TV show doesn't mean it's going to be scary. I'm a big \"Friday the 13th\" fan, but found myself more nostalgic than terrified when I was in the \"Freddy vs. Jason\" house at HHN. Winner: Howl-O-Scream \nIt's showtime: Back to the shows. As my colleague Dewayne Bevil noted , Bill & Ted's Excellent Halloween Adventure at HHN is \"the same and entirely different\" every year. The show is filled with pop culture references and jabs at Disney. \"Fiends\" at Busch Gardens is similar, with Dr. Frankenstein and his assistant Igor telling dirty jokes tied to current events. Howl-O-Scream returns to Busch Gardens for select nights \nHowl-O-Scream returns to Busch Gardens for select nights \nHowl-O-Scream returns to Busch Gardens for select nights See more videos \nFiends is in a more casual venue -- inside the Dragon Fire Grill to create a \"dinner and a show\" type of vibe (dining not required) -- while Bill & Ted is in a large outdoor theater. Both shows feature plenty of dancing and skin, but ironically the most scandalous of the two isn't the one featuring naughty nurses. HHN has another stage show (The Carnage Returns) in a key spot in the park, giving HHN the slight edge in this category. Winner: Halloween Horror Nights \nOutside the screams: Some attractions at both parks are open during the events. Some of Universal's attractions, like Shrek 4-D, are closed to make room for the houses and queues. Wizarding World of Harry Potter â€” Diagon Alley is open during HHN this year, including likely shorter wait times for Escape from Gringotts. \nBusch Gardens steals the show in this category, though. Well, unless you're not a thrill ride fan. Some of the park's signature roller coasters are open during HOS. On opening night, the new Falcon's Fury had a zero-minute wait time. Universal competes with only its Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit coaster. Also, HOS features \"Crash Test Zombies,\" a bumper car attraction with zombies behind the wheel of some of the cars. Winner: Howl-O-Scream \nOverall: After breaking it down, we have a 3-3 tie. This shows that both events have plenty going for them, it just comes down to personal preference. HHN is a bigger overall production, while I think HOS brings more natural, authentic scares. With ticket discounts, it's hard to compare costs and wait times will vary by day (but I'd venture to say HOS is generally less packed). \nFor the purpose of this comparison, I'm declaring Howl-O-Scream the ever-so-slight winner. Lets say it was by the severed finger of a zombie. \nYou really can't go wrong with either, but HOS is certainly worth the trip down to Tampa, as is HHN to those in the bay area. Just choose wisely and plan out your trip so you can pack in the most scares into a fun-filled night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:56:07.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
