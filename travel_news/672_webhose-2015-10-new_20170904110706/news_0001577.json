I love Hinduism,\" he said.\nIndia has seen a rise in incidents of religious intolerance over the past year, with Hindu nationalists trying to create a more Hindu-centric country.\nKeith said he also had a tattoo of the elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesha on his back.\nKeith, who studied law at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, said he did not think he had done anything wrong.\n\"I should not have to apologize for what is on my skin and be put in a traumatizing situation where it is apparently acceptable to be harassed, threatened and mobbed,\" he said.\nBangalore's deputy commissioner of police, Sandeep Patil, said Monday that an inquiry had been ordered into the incident and its handling by local police. \"If police forced the couple to give an apology, it is a serious matter,\" Patil told reporters.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:15:13.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
