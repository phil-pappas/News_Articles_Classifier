This includes its guests, staff and extended community of suppliers, trade partners and local Queenstown community,” judges said. \n“During the tours, visitors discover what a sustainable system in nature looks like, what Ziptrek Ecotours is doing to ‘touch the earth lightly’, and what they can do in their own life to support sustainability.” Ziptrek Ecotours (from L) Ariana Kelly, director Trent Yeo and general manager Stu Cordelle receive their Environmental Tourism Award \nDirector Trent Yeo said this was “a great time to celebrate” for the crew at Ziptrek Ecotours but also the many people who had been involved in building the company over the five-plus years of operation and many more prior to that in development. \n“I’m very proud of what we do for Queenstown and New Zealand,” he said. “Expressing the stories of our place, connecting with the community and all within a context of touching the earth lightly is important, but doing it while having an enormous amount of fun is absolutely fundamental to tourism. \n“Tens of thousands of guests have come to Queenstown, been on Ziptrek and think ‘this place is extraordinary’ and the people who work here really care about that.” \nSelected from over 100 entries, Ziptrek Ecotours was one of 34 finalists in the awards, which represented most sectors across the $24 billion tourism industry. \nEstablished in 2009, Ziptrek is a pioneering New Zealand company, with every member of staff “genuinely passionate” about promoting sustainability and raising awareness of its environment. \nIt takes guests on an eco-adventure combining a zipline (flying fox journey) including the world’s steepest tree to tree zipline, combined with a sustainability story, all with a backdrop of stunning iconic Queenstown. \n“We’ve successfully built a reputation that combines the ‘adventure capital’ uniquely combined with the spirit of ‘100% Pure New Zealand’,” said Trent. Ziptrek Ecotours’ Environmental Tourism Award is right at home in Queenstown \nThe business has seen strong financial results year on year, and is consistently in the Top 10 on Tripadvisor of activities to do in Queenstown, with comments about both the ziplining and eco-curriculum story. \nZiptrek is no stranger to sustainable practice awards, having won the Queenstown Chamber of Commerce Sustainability Award in 2010, achieving Qualmark Enviro Gold accreditation (2011) and winning the Fairfax Sustainable 60 Awards (2011) Marketplace category. \nZiptrek’s optimizes the beautiful structure of living trees to perch their guests up in the canopy of the forest. The ziplines then create a playful journey through an environment their guests wouldn’t normally have the opportunity to experience. This is all happens in line with the environment; the treehouses were built by hand involving a lot of tree climbing and ‘zipping’ materials from one tree to another to minimise impact on the forest floor.
