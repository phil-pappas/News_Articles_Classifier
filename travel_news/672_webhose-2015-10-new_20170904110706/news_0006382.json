So what happens if you don't want to chuck a few hundred dollars a night toward living it up in someone else's decked-out dwelling? \nWith a little bit of planning and creativity you can re-create the experience yourself for a fraction of the price-tag. \nHere's some DIY hacks guaranteed to set you on the path to five-star glamping righteousness. \nCHOOSE YOUR LOCATION WISELY \nThe whole point of glamping is to get as close to nature as humanly possible without actually having to rough it (much). It's all well and good to find that perfect camp spot with the ocean vista, but if the site isn't serviced then you're not doing it right. Ad Feedback \nSometimes the trade-off for serenity is a hot shower, so decide which is more important to you. Would you prefer possible crowds or non-existent bathroom facilities? Let your values guide you! If all else fails, you can always purchase a solar-heated shower. \nINVEST IN A BELL TENT \nWhat would glamping be without the ubiquitous canvas bell tent? They're like the stove-pipes of the camping world, and they're not as expensive as you might think. A standard 2-person Lotus Pearl luxury glamping tent is around NZ$450. \nWhen you consider this is around the same cost as a 2-3 night glamping adventure with any hospitality company, you'll realise this is money well spent. Plus you can deck out your space any way you like and use the tent over and over again. \nBE ECO-FRIENDLY \nGlamping is an inherently sustainable pursuit. But not so if you're racking up a rubbish bag the size of Mount Fuji. \nWhy not go the full-monty on your carbon footprint? Stick with biodegradable bags, take mostly perishable foods like fresh fruit and store in a cardboard box or esky. \nSet the mood with candles and gas lanterns and use external chargers (charged prior to the trip) for anything electrical. Not only will you be doing the earth a favour but the clean-up will be super easy! \nFOOD FIT FOR A QUEEN \nIf you want a glamorous camping experience you'll need to treat it like one. If you're anything like me, food factors rather prominently into the daily equation, even more so when I'm travelling! \nOne piece of advice I have to give is bring real food, it'll make you feel that much more pampered. No packaged items. No cans. And especially no baked beans. Glamping is the perfect time to test out your gourmet grilling skills. Purchase a stove for cooked breakfasts in the morning, a grill for the evenings and a good chilly-bin for dairy items like blue cheese and champagne (yes, I'm well aware that champagne doesn't come from cows). \nALL AIR MATTRESSES ARE NOT CREATED EQUAL \nIs the mattress you plan to take one of those full-bodied queens or simply a skinny blow-up bed that'll deflate as soon as you roll onto your side in the middle of the night? I don't want to remind you how important a good night's sleep is… especially out in the middle of nowhere. \nTaking a good, solid, mattress can mean the difference between hell and some restful zzz's. Get one that's at least half a metre thick and dress it up with your duvet from home for a bit of style and comfort. Sleeping bags are for backpackers. \nLEAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AT HOME \nDisconnecting is good for the soul. There's nowhere to charge your devices anyway so you may as well concede to the simple life for a while. \nIf you can't bare to part with your iPhone for even an hour, get a portable or car charger . \nPACK A RUG \nI'm not talking about your grandma's fifty-thousand dollar Persian, but if the rug fits… Jokes aside, if you've got a quirky little Moroccan inspired weave that isn't too heavy to roll up, plonk it in your car and grant your tent some instant good vibes and style kudos. \nBYO CANDLES… LOTS AND LOTS OF CANDLES \nGlamping is about including the little luxuries of home we wouldn't find in nature. Okay, so you can make fire in nature but I bet it doesn't smell like lavender and frankincense. Apart from being sustainable, candles provide much-needed light for your campsite at night (and are easier to carry than lanterns), they give off a certain blissful ambience when you're sleeping under the stars and their sweet aroma might even neutralise the smell of cows sharing paddock space with you. Just make sure to keep them in a jar on a sturdy surface or else your tent may not be there in the morning. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:00:16.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
