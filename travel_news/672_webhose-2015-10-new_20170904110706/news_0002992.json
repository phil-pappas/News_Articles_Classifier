But that doesn't make me a gourmet.\" He was talking about beer. He was at my house, and I was holding forth on whatever I was pouring, and he was calling me out. He claimed I didn't know anything about beer, including how to pour one. But I really like beer.\nSo when my wife dragged me (memo to self: Change dragged in final version) to a destination wedding in northern Vermont, only one name sprang to mind: Heady Topper.\nHeady Topper is the unicorn of beers. It's been rated the best in the world, and it's impossible to find, even where they make it. Alchemist, the brewery, publishes schedules - accurate to the hour - of when and where it delivers the cans. Rich New Yorkers send lackeys north to stand in line. People sell empties online. Some guy I don't even know in Massachusetts heard I was going to Vermont and asked me to get him some.\nThe wedding was near Newport, which is near Waterbury, which is Heady Topper ground zero. Both towns are in the Northeast Kingdom, the upper-right-hand part of the state. I read Howard Frank Mosher, so I've always imagined the Northeast Kingdom as a cross between Siberia and Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County: remote, odd, and forbidding.\nMore coverage 17th century 'selfies' show at Dutch museum the Mauritshuis A Boston market for every taste and price point On the authentic Harry Potter trail through Scotland But Vermont is in New England, and New England is small. So we flew to Burlington, rented a car, and in less than 90 miles were on the Canadian border in Newport. Which is on Lake Memphremagog, which straddles the border and which happens to figure in the Mosher novel I happened to be reading at the time. So the signs looked good.\nThey take beer seriously in Vermont. They take everything seriously in Vermont, especially their beards. The cows there listen to NPR.\nBut when I started to ask around about Heady Topper, all I got was smirks, insofar as Vermonters are constitutionally able to smirk. Casually asking about Heady Topper is like getting to California in 1850 and asking about the gold.\nAt the wedding, they served Hill Farmstead, whose beers have also been judged the world's best - denominational differences even in Vermont. I was told we were lucky to get it. The beers were all very good, and they all tasted pretty much like Tired Hands' HopHands, which, in my trips to Ardmore, has never been hard to get.\nStill, I kept on about Heady Topper. Silly tourist.\nEventually, a kind soul said that if I scoured the gas stations near Stowe, I might get lucky. That became our final day. But, again, the sort-of smirks. One guy said if I came back at 11 a.m. next Friday, then maybe.\nEventually, we gave up and went to the airport. I wandered to the bar, and there - cue the music and lights - was Heady Topper. Really? Yes. Who looks at the airport? I paid $10 for a can - which I was not allowed to take. But, hey, mission accomplished.\nAnd how was it? Meh. But Mike says I don't know much about beer.\nFred Beckley writes from Philadelphia.\nDid a travel experience move you, change you, or give you great memories?
