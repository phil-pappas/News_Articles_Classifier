The company has through its high quality services, helped in resolving one of the greatest issues faced by train travelers in India.\nDelhi, India, October 18, 2015 --( PR.com )-- When it comes to getting freshly prepared and hygienic food delivery in train right on their berths, most railway passengers rely on the timely and efficient services offered by Traveler Food. This e-catering website has earned the trust and respect of millions of passengers by offering a wide range of meals at different destinations across India. The company has through its high quality services, helped in resolving one of the greatest issues faced by train travelers in India.\nTraveler Food is the brainchild of Amber Arora, a qualified management professional, who established the company no more than 2 years ago. Within the short duration of its existence, the website has made availability of healthy, hygienic and tasty food in train an expected standard in India. The website works in close partnership with some of the most renowned names in the food catering industry across different destinations in India. Its focus has always been on ensuring complete customer satisfaction and providing the clients with best value for money.\nThe success of Traveler Food has ensured that the passengers are no longer dependent on the substandard meals supplied by the railway catering department to satisfy their hunger. Rather, they can now choose from a wide variety of cuisines and dishes that are not only tasty but also prepared in a neat and hygienic environment. The travelers can enjoy both veg and non-veg food delivered right at their berths on the station of their choice, which further adds to the pleasure of train travel.\nFrom delivering a meager 2 to 3 parcels of food in a week in early 2013, Traveler Food today delivers around 500-600 meals per day. This in itself is a proof of the level of popularity and trust that the company has built over the two years in terms of providing meal on train. The consistently high quality of every meal delivered as well as its affordable pricing has made this e-catering site a boon for regular train travelers across the country. In fact, the growing popularity and demand of its services has inspired the website to expand its services to other various stations by the end of next year.\nThe innovative idea that gave birth to Traveler Food over two years back has also inspired the growth of several other e-catering websites offering food delivery services for train passengers. However, what makes Traveler Food stand ahead of its competitors is the fact that despite its enormous success, the company has never wavered from its objective of providing delicious food to travelers in a hassle free and cost effective manner. It is this basic principle that has resulted in the website become one of the leading e-catering services in India and has helped it to win the trust of numerous clients who would otherwise prefer to stay hungry while undertaking a train journey.\nTraveler Food\n210 Jaina Tower-2, Janakpuri West\nNew Delhi- 110058\n91 7827998877, 7835887766\ncontact@travelerfood.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:14:01.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
