It began with an arduous workout routine in the offseason and carried over into training camp. Barrett led the team in preseason in sacks and has made big plays in wins over the Lions and Raiders.\nNo official decision has been made on Ware's status. He hasn't practiced this week after suffering back spasms against the Raiders. He told The Post on Wednesday that he will listen to the training staff regarding his status. If Ware can't go, it would give him two weeks rest with the upcoming bye after the Cleveland game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:08:21.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
