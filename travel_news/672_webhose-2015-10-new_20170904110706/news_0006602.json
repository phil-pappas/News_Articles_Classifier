That is a significant drop from the 400 C (752 F) registered on Thursday by RSN monitoring equipment.\nInspections on Monday and Tuesday found ash accumulation of up to 80 centimeters (31.5 inches) inside the crater and up to 4 cm (1.5 inches) in several areas around the volcano.\nFollowing Friday’s eruption the volcano “maintains visible gas and vapor as well as constant seismic activity,” the report adds.\nOn Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica (OVSICORI) reported a 7.5-hour volcanic temblor that led to them to warn another eruption could be imminent. However, only gas and vapor were emitted, and at 2:30 a.m., the activity seems to have subsided to “moderate levels.”\nA seismograph reading of the Turrialba Volcano from Oct. 20-21.\n(Courtesy OVSICORI-UNA)\nAn additional finding by the RSN team indicates that the separation between the crater’s two openings is decreasing, leading experts to believe they might merge in the future.\nPersistent showers over the weekend washed part of the material away, but the accumulation of ash in creeks located along Turrialba’s outskirts could pose some risk. Experts are keeping a close watch.\n“Materials deposited in the riverbed formed a waterproof layer that could favor the formation of landslides” the report warns.\nContact L.
