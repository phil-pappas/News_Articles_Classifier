The innovative and entertaining afternoon, sponsored by Synchronicities, was delivered to a packed audience of industry professionals at all levels. Bob, who is a world-class leader in developing experiential learning programs for businesses, covered a range of improvisation techniques designed to strengthen team building, conflict management, networking and advanced problem solving skills. \nAttendees were on their feet, talking to fellow participants and putting into practice Bob’s pearls of wisdom. The animated session left participants energized and full of enthusiasm and confidence as Elin Mayer from Mayer Motivations explains: \n“What an energy changer! I knew improv was a useful tool to engage supplier and clients - I now know why and how to really use it effectively. Bob is a fun and educational leader – and learning through fun is certainly the best way!” \nGabriela Marquez from BCD Travel M&I in Mexico added: \n“This session has really encouraged me to break from my comfort zone and prompt fresh thinking. It was also a fun way to network and the interactive nature of it helped to break the ice with fellow participants. I’ve learnt to really listen, not to judge and to take risks.” \n“PCMA Business School was a huge success at IMEX America,” said Deborah Sexton, PCMA President and CEO. “Professor Bob Kulhan’s session participants left Las Vegas armed with a better ability to think on their feet, foster team dynamics and identify barriers to creativity. We look forward to expanding this program and taking PCMA Business School to Frankfurt next April.” \nPCMA Business School will take place at IMEX in Frankfurt on Monday, April 18, 2016. More information will be released shortly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:11:46.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
