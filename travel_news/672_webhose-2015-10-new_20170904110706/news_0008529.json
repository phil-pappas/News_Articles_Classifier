The highly acclaimed yoga practice, endorsed by celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Lena Dunham, involves a soft fabric hammock connected to the ceiling like a giant swing. Participants travel through various poses while sitting, reclining, or even spinning upside down while suspended three feet from the ground.\nAntiGravity founder Christopher Harrison – former gymnast, Broadway performer and actor – made it his life goal to motivate and inspire others with his passion for expression through physicality. He compiled his training and methodology into a yoga form that is now practiced around the world. Most recently, Harrison created the opening segment of the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, which included his team and supermodel Adriana Lima.\nAntiGravity techniques allow a participant to enjoy the benefit of yoga with zero-compression inversions, which provides relief from back pain and improves posture. In addition, levitating meditations are therapeutic and encourage mindfulness. AntiGravity is safe for all active levels and is a great low-impact cardio workout that blasts calories without being too hard on the joints.AntiGravity Aerial Yoga is USD 20 for all guests and is limited to 12 participants per class.\nSource:- Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:03:53.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
