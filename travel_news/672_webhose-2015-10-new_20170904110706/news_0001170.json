By creating the new position of Senior Vice President for Asia, Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts has strategically placed itself in a position to optimise opportunities and growth in the area. \nAndrew Langdon, the newly appointed Senior Vice President for Asia, brings nearly two decades of director-level experience in Asia, while specialising in various fields related to hospitality, property and travel. He has spent the last seven years as an Executive Vice President of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels and Hospitality Group (JLL) in Asia, where he led strategic advisory services such as asset management, operator selection and contract negotiation, valuation, feasibility studies, refinancing and investment sales. Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts currently has eight hotels in Asia. Four of them are in Thailand, while the others are in Singapore, Vietnam, China and the Philippines. The upscale hotel company’s vision is to have at least 20 hotels operating in Asia by 2020. Several projects are already progressing and by the end of 2016, Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts plans to have a presence in Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. “While we have already managed a successful footprint for our brand in Asia, it has become imperative for us to consolidate our operations in this vibrant region,” said Jean Gabriel Pérès, President and CEO of Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts. “Andrew’s in-depth understanding of Asia, exceptional expertise and leadership will be vital as we aim to grow in existing destinations, enter new ones and provide an advanced regional support structure for our hotels that already operate.” A diverse, multi-talented professional, Langdon graduated in his native Australia from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Business in Valuation and Land Administration. Before leading a team of 17 at JLL, he also worked for seven years as Managing Director at Sallmanns, which became one of Asia’s leading independent hospitality and property consultants under his leadership. As Director of Valuation at Savills before that, he was instrumental in guiding valuation and consultancy assignments for a large number of clients, specialising in the hospitality sector. Langdon is a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (MRICS), an Associate of the Australian Property Institute (AAPI), a registered Valuer in Queensland and a Fellow of the Thai Valuers Association (FTVA).
