If you're visiting the Caribbean around Halloween or just need a little scare any time of year, you're bound to encounter more than your share of zombies, jumbies and other astral fellow travelers... The Bermuda Triangle. Image courtesy of NASA • Enter the Bermuda Triangle \nGrowing up in the 1970s, the Bermuda Triangle ranked right up there with the Amityville Horror house among Places You Don't Want to Be. Lately, people seem to have forgotten about the Bermuda Triangle -- a regional also known as the \"Devil's Triangle\" whose geography encompasses a rough triangle between Miami, Puerto Rico and Bermuda . But take it from Caribbean sailors and pilots -- this boat-swallowing, compass-confusing, aircraft-snatching vortex is still out there. The region is the graveyard to a disturbing number of shipwrecks, and the disappearance of an entire squadron of Navy planes in 1945 -- along with a rescue plane sent to find them -- and stories of UFO sightings have added to the Bermuda Triangle legend.

In fact, the word \"zombie\" apparently is derived from the Haitian Crole word \"zombi,\" a term for a person who has been brought back to life but is unable to speak and is controlled by a voodoo sorcerer. Some researchers have claimed that voodoo practicioners may be able to exert control by giving a mix of drugs to their victims. Voodoo adherents in Haiti strongly object to such stories -- they consider themselves Roman Catholics -- but the religion's rituals do include communicating with the spirits of the dead through trances.

The Maya who built the temples at Tulum and Chichen Itza in the Mexican Caribbean frequently practiced human sacrifice, including at the Cenote Sagrado, or sacred sinkhole, of Chichen Itza, where archaeologists have found the skeletal remains of more than 40 men and boys -- apparent sacrificial victims. Mexico also is a great place to visit around Halloween since it corresponds with Mexico's Day of the Dead celebrations (Dia de los Muretos).

The wife of a 19th-century planation owner, Palmer went through a disturbing number of husbands and was believed to be a voodoo mistress. She also was cruel to the slaves who worked on the plantation, including ordering public whippings and torture in a basement dungeon. Palmer's ghost is said to haunt the plantation house, which now is home to a bar and restaurant. The nearby White Witch Golf Course, part of the Ritz-Carlton Rose Hall resort, is named in her dubious honor.

But did you know that investigators into the legend of the Lost City of Atlantis say the doomed city may have been located off the coast of Cuba or near Bermuda or the Bahamas ? Legendary prognosticator Edgar Cayce claimed that the ruins of Atlantis would be found in the South Atlantic, and the discovery of underwater stones cut into geometric shapes off the island of Bimini seemed to support the theory. In 2001, however, underwater explorers discovered stones laid out in a geometric pattern in 2,100-foot-deep waters off Cuba, led to speculation that the sunken remnants of Atlantis had at last been found.

In 2006, a yacht was found off the island of Barbados crewed by the petrified corpses of 11 men -- would-be immigrants bound for the Canary Islands who wound up adrift and helpless in the Atlantic. The Caribbean Sea also is littered with 400 years worth of shipwrecks, from Spanish galleons sunk in hurricanes with all hands to German U-boats sunk in World War II -- some still home to the remains of their doomed crews. Some of these wrecks are now popular destinations for divers, who may feel an icy chill as they explore these underwater graveyards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:50:01.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
