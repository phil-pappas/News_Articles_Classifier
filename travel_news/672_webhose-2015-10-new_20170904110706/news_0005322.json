Both offered attractive rates. Technical errors stopped me and, when I called, both banks’ customer services couldn’t help. To make matters worse, two weeks later I noticed that the interest rate offered by Halifax had gone down. Are these banks offering competitive interest rates to draw customers in, with no intention of paying them? JM, via email While online banking makes thing easier for most people, there’s always the risk of technical errors that you might not get if you went into a branch. • Security breach at Halifax and Bank of Scotland left account activities visible for up to six years • Lloyds shares: will you end up with none if you apply for too many? • 'Why am I being charged an emergency tax rate to withdraw my pension cash?' The Post Office says its online application process is \"simple\" and typically takes less than 15 minutes to complete. But things can take longer when further details are needed and it took more than a week for you to hear back. The organisation said a technical fault meant that you were one of five customers affected. In terms of your problem with Halifax, financial expert David Black from DJB Research said it was not unusual for tracker rates to change on new accounts – banks raise and lower rates as a means to avoid attracting too much or too little money. When it comes to the bond you applied for, the table shows how the rate has varied. Applying at the wrong time can mean a difference of more than half a percentage point in the rate you get.

We regularly review our savings range and make changes in line with the market and our competitors.” But that’s not to say that short-lived savings rates don’t exist. In 2014 several banks offered attractive savings rates only to withdraw them when customer interest peaked. Yorkshire Building Society launched a best buy one-year Isa but had to withdraw it after three weeks, and Chorley Building Society did the same with its two-year savings bond because of \"overwhelming success\". In April 2015 Leeds Building Society took its two market-leading Isas off the market after just eight days. • Have a question for our experts?
