HELENA, Calif. , Oct. 15, At the close of 2015, Meadowood Napa Valley will be substantially through a $60-million dollar renovation, which includes a now fully renovated nine-hole golf course, redesigned guest rooms property-wide and a brand new luxury all-suite Meadowood Spa debuting this month for guests and Members and led by Director of Spa & Wellness Michael Conte .\nArchitecture & Design\nThe new Meadowood Spa was designed by architect Howard Backen and his team at Backen, Gillam & Kroeger Architects , led by David Macneill and interior designer, Leslie Hemmings . The building itself was constructed and brought to life by Bob Eberlin and his team from Eberlin Construction, whose company began construction on the building in January 2014 . The style of architecture reflects and respects the landscape: simple, rustic-modern structures with a strong connection to beyond the building itself, with natural elements flowing throughout. The color palette includes warm greys and browns, deep muted olive green, rustic black and natural flax textured linen.\nPaying respect to its natural surroundings of Meadowood, a majestic oak tree is preserved and celebrated at the Spa's entrance with an amazing hand-forged circular iron fence guarding its perimeter and flanked on both sides by two boutiques. The reception area features warm oak flooring, reclaimed wood beams, hand-applied textural plaster and a fireplace with hand-forged steel. The space offers simple, clean upholstered furniture covered in organic linens, earthy leather and warm, natural rustic pieces. Special local and international artisanal touches include a silk rug from Tibet and handmade pottery from Napa Valley ceramic artist Emil Yanos , combined with curated, antique accessories from Napa Valley and around the world.\nThe calming, organic-feeling is enhanced by handmade Shibori Rust Silk wall hangings from artist Patricia Vivod that grace the walls of the locker room hallway and entrance. Nature-inspired wood, steel and stone fountains also line the treatment walkway where guests make their way to the treatment suites. The eight suites, each of which includes a private bathroom and steam shower, offers an inviting, built-in seating lounge area filled with comfortable cushions and pillows situated in front of large sliding windows that open out to forested views, heightening the sense of complete relaxation.\nAll-Suite Treatment & Wellness Experience\nThe new Spa offers a unique, all-suite concept, creating an elevated spa experience and giving guests a true sense of retreat and privacy. Meadowood Manager of Health & Fitness Kerry Brackett, whose history with the property and long-standing connection to its guests and members, helped shape the concept and direction for the Spa, with Conte taking the helm in June 2015 . Brackett continues her passion for fitness and wellness at Meadowood and is currently undergoing training to be a Certified Wellness Coach.\nThe resort also worked closely with renowned spa and wellness consultants Nancy Nemer of Red Cashew Inc and Anni Hood of Wellness Business Consultancy . Nemer's thorough understanding of the design process and spa operations was instrumental in contributing to the concept creation, planning and technical specification, as well as curating treatment product lines and items for the Spa Boutique and Estate Boutique. Hood introduced the team to the world of wellness, transforming the dynamic of what is expected from a spa treatment into a true wellness journey for guests, offering tips and suggestions for how to incorporate wellness into their lives after they leave the Spa.\nEach guest's visit will begin with an in-depth conversation with a Spa Therapist in the privacy of the treatment suite. The conversation will determine a curated treatment plan for each individual. The suite experience will begin with a soothing signature tea and include a pre-treatment experience (aromatherapy steam shower, dry body brushing or foot bath), followed by the treatment plan created with the therapist concluding with a post-treatment organic elixir. The space is designed to perform every treatment and includes all amenities needed so guests will not have to relocate or move during their spa day unless they choose to use the relaxation gardens.\nThere are two relaxation gardens, one for women and one for men. Each features sitting areas, steam room and sauna and mineral soaking pool. These areas are open for Spa guests pre- or post-treatment.\nThe Meadowood Spa is working with a curated selection of luxury lines with strong senses of place and high efficacy\nCaudalie – A French luxury beauty brand, founded in 1995 by Mathilde and Bertrand Thomas , create beauty products inspired by the grape and the grapevines that are not only effective, but natural and luxurious.
