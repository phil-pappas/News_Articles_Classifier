(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Spirited Traveller: Kansas City's cocktails \nI covered the Blue Jays for a Toronto newspaper in the 1990’s. It was the glory days, for sure, with two World Series wins and a fair bit of time spent on the road covering the team. \nI remember flying one night into Kansas City – a stop the Blue Jays have to make if they want to get to the World Series – after a Jays’ night game in Toronto on the team plane. Nowadays reporters don’t fly with the team but make their own flight arrangements. But, back then, we got to fly on the team’s plane, a super-deluxe job that was used by the folks at MGM, with leather seats and lots of booze and Haagen Dazs ice cream bars. \nAnyway, one night we landed in Kansas City around 2:30 a.m. There was one guy stamping passports at the K.C. airport. He looked at me in a 2:30 a.m. daze and said, “Are you with the team?” I just laughed and explained I was a reporter writing about the Jays. The man looked at me in disbelief. \n“You mean you get PAID to do this?” \nI’ve never forgotten that poor man, so tired and lonely in the wee hours at the Kansas City Airport. I was very lucky to cover the team, and I got to see some pretty cool stuff; weekends in New York City, trips to the Golden Gate Bridge, beaches in Florida. \nOne city I always looked forward to visiting, in fact, was Kansas City. Perhaps it was because it was a bit of an underdog city without a sterling reputation. I don’t know, but the city always surprised me a bit with its sophistication. Perhaps the dedicated Jays fans who will be following the team in Kansas City will find the same. \nIt’s been a few years since I visited, but here are a few things I recall from my stays over a five or six-year period covering the Blue Jays. \n\nFOUNTAINS: The folks in K.C. say Rome is the only city in the world with more fountains than they have. The atmosphere isn’t quite the same in Missouri as it is in Italy, but they have some truly magical fountains in Kansas City, including some modelled after Spanish fountains. Expect carved horses and modern art sculpture and courtyard fountains and all sorts of varieties. \n\nSHOPPING AND DINING: This ain’t New York or Toronto, but the Country Club Plaza area of the city is a delightful, pedestrian-friendly area with buildings designed to look like Seville or other cities in the south of Spain. Expect red-tile roofs and small courtyards and a wide variety of shops and restaurants, with everything from Midwestern, corn-fed steaks to trendy Italian to spicy Mexican food. Oh, and lots of fountains. \n\nHOTELS: The Jays used to stay at a Ritz Carlton near the Country Club Plaza. A bit high-end for most fans, especially given the U.S. dollar. The Country Club Plaza is a new hotel with a rooftop pool, doncha know. There are tons of convention-style hotels in the downtown area, including a nice Westin at the Crown Center and a couple out near Kauffman Stadium, including a Hilton and an affordable Four Points by Sheraton. \n\nBARBEQUE: Kansas City BBQ is some of the best around. I always liked Arthur Bryant’s but it’s a bit of a chain and maybe not that interesting. These days folks seem to lean to BB’s Lawnside Barbecue, Woodyard Bar-B-Q and Joe’s Kansas City Bar-B-Que. I haven’t tried them but would love the opportunity. \n\nWESTERN GEAR: When I covered the Jays they had Jack Morris as one of their pitchers. He almost always sported a pair of nice cowboy boots, so many of the players did the same. I bought a pair in Kansas City myself, I think at Shepler’s. There are tons of western apparel shops in Kansas City, which is pretty much on the frontier of the wild west and right across the river from the state of Kansas. Try Nigro’s Western Store or Cavender’s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:06:46.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
