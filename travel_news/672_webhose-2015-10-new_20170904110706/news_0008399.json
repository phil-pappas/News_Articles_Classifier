The area is one of the most important strategic points on Pudong’s economic map. In recent years, under the Focus on Lujiazui strategy, the region’s administrative committee has regarded the healthy development of a headquarters economy as an important means to transform Lujiazui’s economic growth model and improve its international competitiveness. Shanghai city government started encouraging transnational enterprises to set up regional headquarters in the city in 2002. Since then, with its unique advantage as a pioneer of China ’s reform in finance, economy and trade, the Pudong district government has piloted a series of measures to create a favourable business environment to attract corporate regional headquarters. Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone is still expanding rapidly, partially to seek enough space for the further development of its headquarters economy The corporate headquarters Lujiazui has welcomed include those of international companies, financial institutions, state-owned enterprises and domestic private enterprises. The headquarters economy has been taking up an increasingly bigger proportion in Lujiazui’s economy. According to the administrative committee, by the end of June Lujiazui had attracted more than 300 agencies with the functions and characteristics of corporate headquarters. Currently, the region contains 86 regional headquarters of trans-national companies, 39 of investment companies and 47 of management companies. Financial Hub: More companies are basing themselves in Lujiazui Lujiazui Financial and Trade Zone is still expanding rapidly, partially to seek enough space for the further development of its headquarters economy. There are 27 large infrastructure construction projects ongoing in Lujiazui, with a construction area of one million square miles, including the Shanghai Tower, Shanghai International Financial Center and Century Metropolis. These buildings, once completed, will be available as regional headquarters of financial institutions, international companies and largescale domestic enterprises. In six meetings with representatives from enterprise early this year, the Lujiazui administrative committee showed its strong desire to gather suggestions from entrepreneurs on how to improve its work. A headquarters economy is an economic model evolving with the development of business areas The enterprises said they hoped the government would further simplify its procedures, improve efficiency and grant businesses more freedom and space. “The government should transform its functions to better serve the development of the free trade zone,” said Shen Xiaoming, the Party chief of Pudong district, after a recent inspection of the area. “Lujiazui should create an international and rule-of-law business environment and improve its financial services functions, so as to become an important point in the allocation of global resources.” A headquarters economy is an economic model that evolves along with the development of business areas and a central business district. The aggregation and scale effects of economic resources and factors in telecommunication, transport, finance and logistics in an area increase the efficiency of economic activities and innovation. Shanghai started relocating advanced manufacturing industries that transferred from Japan and the other developed regions in Asia in the 1990s after the central government earmarked Pudong as a new district to experiment with reform and opening-up policies. After Shanghai city government took the lead among cities across China in making a headquarters economy an important development strategy in 2002, foreign companies started transferring their regional headquarters as well as research and development centres to the city. The Golden Corridor, from Lujiazui in the east to Xujiahui and Hongqiao in the west of Shanghai, accounts for more than 70 per cent of the city’s headquarters economy • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:27:14.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
