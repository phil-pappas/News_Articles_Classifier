Americans cannot travel as ordinary tourists to Cuba under current U.S. regulations, but they may participate in certain types of trips, including people-to-people trips that foster cultural exchanges. \nCarnival said the trips will \"focus on supporting cultural exchange and economic development for the Cuban people and include a variety of artistic, educational and humanitarian activities.\" \nThe preliminary itinerary includes meetings with artists, entrepreneurs, schoolchildren and others in settings ranging from the Afro-Cuban community in Havana's Muraleando neighbourhood to an organic farm to colonial heritage sites. \nCarnival says the Cuba cruises will begin in May. \nAll trips offered by the Fathom brand will have a focus on volunteering in a destination. The brand is also selling service trips to the Dominican Republic.
