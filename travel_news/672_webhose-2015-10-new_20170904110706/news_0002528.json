In Hong Kong, for instance, the largest decline (-18 per cent) in hotel prices was on the second week of May, while in Tokyo, the first week of January accounted for the biggest dip (-16 per cent). \n\nComparatively, booking a hotel in New York on the first week of January is 41 per cent cheaper than average, while hotels in Barcelona during end-January is up to 42 per cent less costly. \n\nFor most destinations worldwide, the cheapest time to book a hotel is during the beginning of the year, with 22 out of the 25 cities studied offering below average rates. The months of September and October are, on the other hand, the most expensive time to book a room. \n\nSeasonal holidays and major events which fall on different dates may result in the data being inconsistent year-on-year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:53:53.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
