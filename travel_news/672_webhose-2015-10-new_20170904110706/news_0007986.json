This marks a boost to its already extensive ongoing maintenance schedule which has been in place since the venue opened nearly 25 years ago. Nick Waight, Managing Director of the ICC comments: “The planned refurbishments will improve the customer experience and freshen up the venue to ensure that event organisers have the best canvas to work with when holding their events at the ICC. The work on Hall 3 was completed in August and we have had extremely positive feedback about the changes from customers.” He added: “This comes at an exciting time for us as we’re also opening our new venue the Vox at Resorts World - and indeed for Birmingham which as a city is reaping the results of some fantastic urban regeneration projects with the unveiling of the new Grand Central and New Street Station complex last week. It really is the ideal time to rediscover Birmingham as an events destination.” The ICC holds over 350 events per year, with over 300,000 delegates and has around 80,000 people passing through its central Mall each week so careful consideration has been given to the implementation of the work to avoid disruption to the events schedule. The ICC was the UK’s first purpose-built convention centre and still benefits from the huge £200m initial investment in terms of fantastic infrastructure, access and spaces. From the perfect acoustics and sound proofing right through to chairs designed specifically to remain comfortable for long conference sessions, the ICC is an iconic venue located at the heart of Birmingham.
