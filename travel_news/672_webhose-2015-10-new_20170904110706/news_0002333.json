About LookSmart, Ltd.\nLookSmart, Ltd. was organized in 1996 and is incorporated in the State of Delaware . LookSmart, Ltd. is a digital advertising solutions company that provides relevant solutions for search and display advertising customers, organized along five lines of business: (i) Clickable, (ii) LookSmart AdCenter, (iii) Novatech.io, (iv) ShopWiki and (v) web searches. In addition, LookSmart, Ltd. formed a partnership with Conversion Media Holdings, LLC, which supports the company's other lines of business through the creation of content sites directed at ecommerce verticals. The company operates its partnership and each line of business, while being related to the others in terms of shared resources, as separate business lines with their own core management, profits and losses, and the ability to operate independently as separate businesses. As a result, this separation of business lines allows Looksmart, Ltd. to operate effectively as a holding company and as a capital allocator to each of the company's separate businesses with the goal of finding mispriced assets in the public and private markets and subsequently taking those assets to create scalable and sustainable businesses that may then be monetized for the ultimate benefit of Looksmart, Ltd.'s stockholders.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws.
