The event costs $109 for non-members and includes green fee, prizes, post-golf lunch and a donation to the Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation, a local charity established to support women with breast cancer and their families.\nPacific Dunes will continue the fundraising efforts throughout October, the ‘Month of Pink’, with signage, flags, poles, balls and staff uniform turning pink for the occasion. In total, organisers are hoping to raise more than $5000 in donations.\nPacific Dunes’ 18-hole championship golf course also offers a popular café and bar, which has just launched a new spring menu. Featuring a selection of vegetarian and meat dishes, a number of gluten free options, revised kids’ choices and daily specials, the new menu was designed by head chef Sheldon Black after conducting focus group research into the dining-out habits of customers. Black is passionate about drawing on local, seasonal produce and the new menu’s breakfasts, lunches and dinners reflect this. The café is open for breakfast and lunch seven days a week and offers dinner on Friday nights.\nSource:- Port Stephens", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:16:11.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
