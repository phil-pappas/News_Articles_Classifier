The Jordan Pass was launched in September as a “unified ticket” for independent travellers looking to visit the country's most popular sights such as the ancient city of Petra and the Unesco World Heritage site of Wadi Rum, however the scheme has come under criticism from tourists, who say staff at some attractions and border points are unaware of its existence. One traveller also claimed that she was incorrectly charged €700 (£520) on attempting to buy the pass online. The Jordan Pass combines the country’s visa fee of 40 JD (£37) with the notoriously costly Petra entrance fare of 50 JD (£47), as well as giving access to more than 40 other historical sites, museums and attractions in the Middle Eastern country, including the Roman ruins of Jerash, the Amman Citadel, and Karak Castle, a popular stop-off on the route south through the country. The Jordan Pass includes entry to more than 40 sites in Jordan, including the Roman ruins at Jerash Photo: AP With three options costing 70 JD, 75 JD and 80 JD, depending on the number of days spent at Petra, the pass is designed to lure tourists with an immediate saving of 20 JD, once the visa fee and admission to the Nabatean rock-cut city are taken into account. It is aimed at independent travellers, as those booked with tour operators already benefit from a visa waiver system introduced earlier this year , and have often pre-paid for attraction tickets in the cost of their tour. The introduction of the pass is the latest in a series of measures aimed at reviving Jordan’s ailing tourism industry, which has suffered as a result of conflict in neighbouring Iraq and Syria . The UK Foreign Office currently considers the vast majority of the country safe, bar a thin strip of land near the Syrian border. However, early users have reported problems purchasing and using the pass, which must be bought online before arrival in Jordan. Marta Leonor Vidal Garcia, from Spain, said that she was charged seven times after attempting to order a pass earlier this month, despite receiving \"failure at processing credit card\" messages on her seven purchase attempts. The cost amounted to about €700, including processing fees. When the payments appeared to have failed, Ms Garcia said that she wrote to the Jordan Pass administrators. “They answered that the payment had not been completed due to a technical failure, which they blamed on my banks. Their only suggestion was to try it again on another computer.” Ms Garcia was not able to obtain a Jordan Pass before her holiday, so travelled without. “I was rather disappointed because the savings in tourism tickets and visa were considerable purchasing the Jordan Pass. Visa and tourism ticket to Petra are especially expensive.” “I was rather disappointed because the savings in tourism tickets and visa were considerable purchasing the Jordan Pass. Visa and tourism ticket to Petra are especially expensive.” Marta Leonor Vidal Garcia, a visitor to Jordan unable to buy the Jordan Pass online She said that she found out about the €700 charge on the last day of her holiday, when she accessed her bank account online. “I found seven wrong charges of Jordan Pass in my credit cards for more than €700 that I had to claim from Visa when I came back to Spain. My banks have refunded me the charges until the claim is resolved.” She said that she received an email from the Jordan Pass administrators on September 25 saying that they were investigating the error. She added that Jordan is a “wonderful destination” and hoped that her experience was “exceptional or a one-off failure” – but that the pass would be better made available on arrival in Jordan, at the airport and at tourist information points. A spokesperson from the Jordan Tourist Board (JTB) told Telegraph Travel that they were in contact with banks to minimise such cases in the future: \"This is happening mainly in Spain so I suspect it could be a shared policy for cards issued there, but we [have] still processed successful tickets for Spain.” \"The authorities were not prepared and could not scan our ticket. Sometimes it was explaining waiting, checking, discussing.” Sofie, tourist in Jordan But another visitor to Jordan said she encountered problems having the pass accepted at sites once in the country. Sofie from Belgium – who did not wish to give her full name – said that only Jerash and Petra had scanners for her ticket. “All the rest of the places the authorities were not prepared and could not scan our ticket. Sometimes it was explaining waiting, checking, discussing,” she said. At Wadi Rum, she said that she and her partner were asked for a ticket for stamping, but this was not possible because they had the e-ticket version of the Jordan Pass. “We don't know why they always want to stamp because we would take the ticket back with us anyway. Or do they think we would print 15 times and leave a ticket at each location there?” Wadi rum jordan the martian Photo: Alamy The JTB spokesperson admitted that they had received complaints about staff at sites not being aware of the pass, and apologised for the situation: “While the ministry did everything possible to communicate the Jordan Pass offering to all stakeholders, we still received complaints. Please be reassured that the minister himself is on top of this and we can confirm that such issues are now resolved.” At the beach resort of Aqaba, Sofie said that she and her partner were apparently the first people to enter the museum and fort with a Jordan Pass. She said: “The guy wanted to take a photocopy of the screen on our smartphone with the e-ticket.” \"We are still very happy to have taken the pass because it was much cheaper all together. We just hope single site/attraction/communit[ies] will see money from it.\" Sofie, a tourist just returned from Jordan The pair also said that they had a 90-minute delay on arriving in Jordan, while immigration officials examined their Jordan Pass e-tickets. “We were taken to a small office close to the passport control. We have never known what the problem was, since not one of the six persons we saw could speak English to inform us,\" she said. Sofie said that overall she was \"still very happy\" to have bought the pass because it was \"much cheaper altogether. We just hope single site/attraction/communit[ies] will see money from it.\" The JTB added that there were plans to install Jordan Pass instructions in Arabic and English at the entry to each site, and at all Jordan’s border points, so that entry conditions were clear for everyone. It is also planning to provide telephone support for holders “in case they face any issues”. They insisted that site staff and guides would benefit rather than lose out from the removal of cash interactions with tourists: “The specific income from the Jordan Pass is distributed among the sites to be used for enhancements including the pay of the employees there,” it said. Images of Petra By Night is one of the country's most frequently used promotional materials - but entry to the event is not included in the Jordan Pass Photo: © Ken Kaminesky Tourists who buy the pass must still pay extra for some of Jordan’s most popular attractions, which it does not cover. They include Mount Nebo, the “Petra by Night” candlelit walk – images of which constitute some of Jordan’s most alluring promotional material – and the Baptism Site, which was this year added to Unesco’s list of world heritage sites. The JTB said that it is was working with more attractions that may be included in the future: \"We are now working to add even more value including discounts at museums, restaurants, experiences and activities; the project is still in the early stages and hopefully will continue to develop.\" • Jordan: trip of a lifetime In a piece about the Jordan Pass , writer and journalist Matthew Teller also pointed out that the pass allows “free entry” to many sites that already do not collect admission fees, including Salt Archaeological Museum, the ruins at Pella, and Shobak Castle, a remainder of the Crusaders’ presence in the Middle East. Other caveats are that the pass is only available for tourists spending three or more nights in Jordan, and customers are charged a 2.75 per cent processing fee – 1.93 JD on the cheapest ticket. Jordan’s tourism industry has suffered as a result of conflict in neighbouring Iraq and Syria: statistics from the Ministry of Tourism & Antiquities show a 10 per cent fall in tourist numbers in the first three months of 2015 compared to last year.

The Jordan Pass is one of multiple initiatives that the Jordan Tourist Board and the Ministry of Tourism have initiated, in an attempt to lure visitors back. Earlier this year they invited a host of bloggers to the country to post pictures and messages on social media about their experiences of visiting the country. Authorities have also launched a billboard and taxi advertising campaign in European countries including the UK and France, featuring images of the Dead Sea beaches and the desert landscapes of Wadi Rum.
