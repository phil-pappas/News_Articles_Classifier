The work to be undertaken in 2016 will ensure they continue to be the finest luxury experience at sea, with an unparalled glamour and sophistication.\n'I am confident that the new Grills experience on board the world's most iconic ship will attract even more accolades and exceed the expectations of all those who book to sail Queens Grill or Princess Grill.'\nThis year Cunard is celebrating its 175th anniversary of the first Atlantic crossing. The cruise liner first changed the face of sea travel back in 1840, when its Britannia ship successfully set sail from Liverpool, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, 14 days later.\nAnd in Liverpool in July, the Queen Mary 2 was greeted with fanfare and fireworks as it set off on the same voyage to honour the historic date.\nDANCING QUEENS! CUNARD'S QUEEN VICTORIA AND QUEEN ELIZABETH CRUISE SHIPS JOIN THE QUEEN MARY 2 IN LIVERPOOL FOR A SYNCHRONISED 'RIVER DANCE' CELEBRATING THE COMPANY'S 175TH ANNIVERSARY The world's largest and grandest ocean liner, the Queen Mary 2, was joined for the first time ever on the River Mersey by fellow fleet members the Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth back in May this year for an unprecedented 'dance' in celebration of Cunard's 175th anniversary.\nAlthough the festivities went on for the past three days, the main event took place in Liverpool on Monday with a precision manoeuvre by the three vessels in front of thousands of spectators.\nAfter their rotation the ships formed a spectacular arrowhead formation, then posed for the cameras before arranging themselves three abreast for the first time in any body of water.\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Tourist takes planking craze to a new level on travelator\nWatch video Step out onto the mysterious 5th floor Yanggakdo hotel\nWatch video Chinglish: People are tested on the 'language' skills\nWatch video Secret Retreat: UXUA Casa Hotel & Spa in Trancoso\nWatch video The very GORGEOUS and very SLEEK Silver Fast superyacht\nWatch video 'It's a lot quicker': Rihanna on why she likes taking the Tube\nWatch video Make sure you don't look like a tourist with this guide\nWatch video Moment University Challenge contestant jumps at buzzer\nWatch video See the moment this woman finds out she's a grandma\nWatch video Holly's tears at mother's PTSD battle after son's death\nWatch video Maxwell Banbury floors Andrew Mason in vicious club attack\nWatch video Ambulance rushes Lamar Odom to hospital in race to save him\nAfter their rotation the ships formed a spectacular arrowhead formation, then posed for the cameras\nThe 'dance' was to culminate with a flyover salute by nine jets from the famous Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's Aerobatic Team.\nThe Queen Mary 2 treated onlookers to a magnificent sail-past of the city's historic waterfront earlier this weekend, before tying up at the berth for a little over 24 hours.\nDuring her overnight stay, the 2,600 passengers on board were able to visit Liverpool's sights and experience the energy of the city.\nThe vessels, named the Three Queens, perform their impressive turn in front of thousands of spectators to mark Cunard's 175th anniversary\nAnd to mark such a significant occasion - the first time that all three Queens have taken to the water together - the Red Arrows were also on hand to complete a series of impressive manoeuvres in their honour.\nThe world famous acrobatic team followed the Mersey, flying in formation over the three ships in what was one of the most extraordinary spectacles that the city has ever seen.\nCunard Director, Angus Struthers, said at the time: 'The arrival of the Queen May 2, the largest passenger ship ever to sail up the Mersey, signalled the beginning of Cunard's Salute to Liverpool celebrations in the place where the Cunard story began 175 years ago.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1RbahC2", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-10-15T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:38:37.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
