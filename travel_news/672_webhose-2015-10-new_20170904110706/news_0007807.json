This means they struggle to balance vocation and avocation. When vacation time finally arrives, artists need to relax as much as anybody. But they also have a lot of pent up desire to paint and sculpt. One way they can satisfy both needs is by enrolling in an island art workshop during their vacation. Workshops such as these are usually held in an artist’s studio, and typically range from a full week to a single afternoon session.\nThere’s one essential tip for a great workshop experience: Bring the proper attitude. It’s not a competition. Laughter, a light touch, and the Caribbean are a good mix. Artists should do their best to leave perfectionism behind, at least during the span of the workshop.\nThe Bahamas | Susan Abbott\nNoted Vermont-based painter Susan Abbott has been conducting workshops in the Bahamas for six years. Her “Bahamas Winter Retreat” is a week-long workshop held February 3 – 8, 2016 at the Hummingbird Art Centre in Hope Town, on Elbow Cay. The center has a workshop space that includes a studio for indoor classes.\n“My classes in the Bahamas focus on landscape painting in oil or watercolor,” said Abbott. “I suggest to students that they concentrate more on process than product while on Elbow Cay. In other words, think more about trying new things, experimenting with composition, and absorbing the light and color of the island – take the pressure off themselves to leave the workshop with finished paintings.”\nAbbott’s students have two painting sessions a day working directly from island motifs, which include sun-splashed harbor views, street scenes, and the island’s Caribbean architecture. There’s also time set aside for critiques, lessons in composition and color, and slide lectures on the history of landscape painting, with a focus on techniques used.

Her five-day “Living Among the Artists Workshop” is conducted in the Gallery Inn, a 300-year old colonial building in the heart of Old San Juan. Workshop participants have a choice between painting and sculpting. While supplies are provided, Comas noted that students may want to bring their own favorite supplies with them.\n“We’ll also help students pack their sculptures for the trip home,” said Comas. “I bring clay sculptures back and forth from Italy all the time in my carry on.”\nIn addition to lessons in art, Comas is big on encouraging students to dive into the culture of Puerto Rico, sample the local cuisine, and tour San Juan’s historical attractions. She even arranges a tango demonstration free of charge, with students having the option to add a few tango lessons to their San Juan sojourn.

(Photo: David Pinto)\nA location itself can be inspiring, which is the case with Good Hope Pottery & Gallery. The pottery studio is located on the grounds of the historic Good Hope Estate in Jamaica, surrounded by thick stands of bamboo and partially restored 17th century buildings. The husband and wife team of David and Sheila Pinto offer weekly classes that meld pottery and yoga.\n“We welcome participants at every experience level, to help shape their journey in art and also add a dimension of local energy,” said Pinto. “We are in Jamaica, up in this magical old sugar plantation property, where in addition to making pottery, we celebrate local food and culture.”\nThe session starts at 9 a.m. with a one hour yoga class and then continues with a 10 a.m. to noon pottery class. Students can learn how to create pottery on the wheel, or hand-build their creations. If they have a head of steam going, inspired students can continue to work on their own until 2 p.m. Workshop costs include instruction, clay, glazing, firing, studio and tools. There’s also the option to sign up for a single day of pottery making. David and Sheila Pinto can be contacted at jamaicaclay@gmail.com.\nCuracao | Nena Sanchez\nSanchez's workshop session concentrates on painting with acrylics and includes all materials: paper, acrylic paint, brushes, and easel.
