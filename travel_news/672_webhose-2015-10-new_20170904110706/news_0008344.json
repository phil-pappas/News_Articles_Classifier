Ms Smith’s mother died in June after 10 years in residential care. She says: “The system relies on us living with families close together with room to move elderly parents in but it just isn’t the case. It also assumes parents will accept their children’s advice/wishes.” Ms Smith is an example of the “sandwich generation”, those with demands on time and finances as they try to care for two generations. Those demands could place pressure on their own retirement plans. A report from Old Mutual found the average annual retirement income in the UK was £19,700, an increase of £700 from 2014. But those over 50 were expecting an income of £26,000. Save more now and get your finances in order so you’re ready to cope with the strain How do you square that circle? Hayley North, chartered financial planner and independent financial adviser from London-based Rose & North, says it’s important not to abandon your own needs. “Don’t stop contributing into your pension plans, ISAs and emergency savings pots, though you might need to cut them. If you’re paying for care fees from your parents’ assets, they might not have much left later on.” But it’s best to plan ahead before you face Ms Smith’s sitiuation. “Save more now and get your finances in order so you’re ready to cope with the strain.” Consolidate bills (TV, broadband, etc) and find better deals on car or home insurance, says Ms North. “If you have children grown up enough to manage their own budgets, get them to take responsibility for their own money.” Start a JISA (junior ISA) and contribute regularly. The limit is £4,080 this tax year. Ms North says: “If you get good advice and invest in a range of funds, this can really grow and reduce the pressure of school or university fees. Interest rolls up on these mortgages which can double the amount borrowed over 10 years For children over 16, a standard ISA, for which the limit is £15,240, will do the same thing. “Ensure you have wills and lasting powers of attorney in place. Dealing with this later on can be time-consuming.” Helping older children buy a house might free you up to downsize. If you’re struggling to pay your mortgage, now’s the time to consider locking in a low fixed-interest rate, as interest rates look like they might start to rise. If your parents live in their own home, consider downsizing it to release capital. Assuming they don’t have a mortgage, consider equity release (a lifetime mortgage, for example). These mortgages are repaid on your parents’ death or when the house is sold. But Ms North warns: “Interest rolls up on these mortgages which can double the amount borrowed over 10 years.’’ You may also be interested in: • Six questions to ask your pension adviser • The new shape of retirement • Balancing pensions against retirement income", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:42:16.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
