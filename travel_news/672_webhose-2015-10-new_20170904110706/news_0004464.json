The team joined SACO from Union Hanover, a specialist real estate investment and development company with a hospitality focus and an established, successful track record. \nThe team is London-based and includes Eric Jafari, who has become SACO’s Managing Director of Development. Working alongside him are Andrew Fowler (Acquisitions Director), Merzak Kaddour (Head of Development Financing), and Charles Cresser (Development Director). This team joins as SACO continues to establish itself as the leading serviced apartment operator in the UK and executes its plans to expand into mainland Europe. Stephen Hanton, CEO Commercial of SACO, says: “SACO is set for major growth over the next two years with new properties opening across the UK, Ireland and mainland Europe, and the welcome arrival of the new team gives us the additional expert resources to sustain this fast pace of expansion.” SACO’s latest aparthotel will open in the first quarter of 2016 at Cannon Street in London. There will be 77 apartments, an on-site gym and a communal area for guests to relax or work in. Further aparthotels are due to open in Edinburgh, Dublin, Aberdeen, Glasgow and Amsterdam from late 2016.
