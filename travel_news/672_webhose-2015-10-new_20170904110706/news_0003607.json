Skill shortages are a worry in all sectors, from manufacturing, construction and retail to hospitality, leisure, transport and finance. In most industries, IT and digital skills are most in demand, with a shortage in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) students putting dreams of a manufacturing renaissance at risk. According to the UK Salary Guide 2015 from recruiter Hays, 70pc of SME employers say they do not have the talent they need to achieve their objectives, with the national average only slightly better at 67pc. “It is often the impact of the UK skills shortage on larger organisations that grabs the headlines, but SMEs have real concerns as well,” says Hays Marketing’s managing director Clare Kemsley. “Technology is transforming the way brands and organisations engage with their audiences, so SMEs are concerned about the lack of digital skills. The shortage will hold them back.” 70pc of SME employers say they do not have the talent they need to achieve their objectives The Hays findings are backed by a recent poll of entrepreneurs by accountants EY, which found that 77pc of entrepreneurs have difficulty attracting talent, rising to 91pc in the tech sector. Many SMEs are employing more freelancers to fill skills gaps. Upwork is an agency that supplies freelance web developers, virtual assistants, designers, creatives and sales and marketing professionals. “By being open to hiring freelancers, an SME can access the brightest people with the skills in demand,” says Upwork senior vice-president Rich Pearson. For longer-term solutions, SMEs need different approaches. First, they must build relationships with key educational institutions to secure a flow of new people into their industries. They must also invest in technology that will provide employees with greater flexibility, allowing more staff to work flexibly and remotely and limiting the attrition in short-staffed sectors such as those heavily reliant on STEM skills. And they must pay market-rate salaries to keep highly skilled people. The UK’s history of invention and innovation is at the heart of the Government’s drive to rejuvenate manufacturing. But unless the UK commits wholeheartedly to addressing skills shortages, particularly in STEM careers, that drive will be underpowered. • To find out how Bibby supports 7,000 UK businesses, visit www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:56:28.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
