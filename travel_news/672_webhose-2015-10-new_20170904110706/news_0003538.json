Visit/Stay at a Monastery (Perhaps in Leh?) 2. Visit the Golden temple (perhaps on my way back OR On my way to McLeodganj?) 3. Any other Options to connect with Nature/ Experience the Simple Life/Mediations of any kind I do not want to sight see, I don't want to visit any crowded places. The lesser people the better. The Aim is to connect with nature, and offer whatever volunteer services I can offer to the local institutions there. I would love to attend Monastery Courses and local Art/Languages. I am already looking at LHA I would love to stay at a monastery for the entire duration if that is possible. Although there is no budget restriction, I want to make it a trip where it's about spending the least money, simple living. If anyone has any experience in this kind of travel around Dharamshala/Leh I would love to hear from you.
