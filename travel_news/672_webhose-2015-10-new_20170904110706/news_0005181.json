With the passage of PACE, states will now have the flexibility to make and implement decisions regarding the size of the market and employers will have much needed time to communicate information and enroll their employees.\n“We look forward to the President’s swift signage of this legislation which would benefit over one million employees in our industry, tens of thousands of food service establishments, and many more other small businesses across the country.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:57:57.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
