The commitment and positive ethics of these partners have done the Seychelles proud once again in Italy. \nTourism is important to the country’s economy, and markets such as Italy play an important role. It has not only proved to be significant but has also paved the way to tap into this important market. Local companies present made the journey to pay testament to this fact with their presence at the TTG Travel and Tourism Show, a fair of growing importance. \nMrs. Bernadette Willemin, STB’s European Director, noted that the Seychelles Tourism Board recognizes the true potential that lies in Italy as an important market with unprecedented record; TTG is thus a stepping-stone to tap into that potential. “Coming here is not without benefit, as our visitor arrivals from this market would suggest. Italy remains our third biggest market and for years now. Already a 10% growth has been recorded in the first 9 months of this year, consolidating the Italian market bronze ranking position,” she concluded. \nAs this market has proved its potential, time and time again, travel operators and agents would welcome more support from the local trade in building a closer relationship, as they have had in the past, and mutually intending to grow this market even further. \nThe Seychelles Tourism Board will continue to solidify its foothold in this southern part of Europe, ensuring positive growth of the industry and determined to remain competitive in the face of ever-growing challenges. Various activities have been planned for the rest of year to bring the destination into greater focus. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
