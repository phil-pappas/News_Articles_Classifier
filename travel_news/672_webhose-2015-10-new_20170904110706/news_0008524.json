There are currently 44 Radisson Blu hotels in operation across the region, up from 26 hotels five years ago. And with 35 additional Radisson Blu hotels in the pipeline set to open in Asia Pacific over the next few years, Blu Day is an annual event that gets bigger and better every year. Globally, there are more than 280 Radisson Blu hotels in 62 countries.\n“Radisson Blu is one of the fastest growing hotel brands in Asia Pacific and Blu Day is a great opportunity for us to engage our guests, employees and communities and to show our appreciation for their continued support of this iconic brand,” said Sandy Russell, vice president, Commercial Operations, Asia Pacific, Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group. “Blu Day is also an exciting and experiential celebration of all the things that guests love about Radisson Blu, including its hallmarks of Free Internet, Yes I Can!SM service philosophy and 100% Guest Satisfaction.”\nTeams across the region were encouraged to go all out to demonstrate why Radisson Blu is Asia Pacific’s ‘Favorite Blu’. Blue decorations, blue food and blue cocktails were just the beginning. Many hotels also seized the opportunity to give back to their communities. Before sunrise in China, the Radisson Blu Liuzhou staff delighted street cleaners with breakfast. Later that morning, the team led a blood donation drive, in partnership with the Red Cross. With a blood donation bus right outside the hotel, staff, guests and members of the public were all encouraged to give blood. The team also hosted a hotel visit and lunch for students from Yu Cai Special School. The evening was reserved for celebrating, with revelers enjoying themselves at the BLU Party well into the wee hours.\nIn India, the Radisson Blu Ranchi team invited the children of Maher Maika Orphanage to join them for lunch at the hotel and presented each child with a hamper that included school supplies, daily necessities, toiletries and sweet treats like chocolates and biscuits. Employees also donated clothes to the orphanage. They also donated rice, flour and toiletries to the Blind School for Girls.\nIn Southeast Asia, the Radisson Blu Plaza Bangkok hosted a special Blu-themed luncheon for 30 children from Baan Nokkamin Foundation. The hotel’s staff delighted the children with blue balloons, a sumptuous spread that included blue cupcakes, as well as new schoolbags with their favorite cartoon characters.\nAnd in the South Pacific, the Radisson Blu Fiji Resort Denarau Island reached out to the youth in the community by helping to establish libraries and library services at Nawaka, Nadi Primary, Mulomulo, Nadi District, Nawai and Ralete primary schools. Some 80 students were also invited to join in the Blu Day celebrations at the hotel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:31:24.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
