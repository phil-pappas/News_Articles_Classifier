PUBLISHED: 12:58, Sat, Oct 10, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:29, Sat, Oct 10, 2015 Splash News LURED TO THE LAIR: Nicci Taylor, with James, sold all her possessions to travel around the world \nNicci Taylor, 49, put her house on the market, ditched the daily grind and hit the road with Milo her pet labrador. The former air hostess admitted, unashamedly, that she was on a mission to find true love before she hit the big five-oh. \nAnd it seemed all dreams were answered when she excitedly announced that she'd moved in with James Pollard, a 55-year-old landowner in the Highlands. \nThe happy couple even appeared on national television to speak about their relationship. However, Nicci disclosed this week that they have separated after less than two months together.

Finito. Ended. Gone.” In more reflective mood she added: “I truly thought I had found my fairytale ending. I was so happy for a moment in time. I did believe I nearly had it all.” \nThe adventure began in July, after she was made redundant. Nicci, who has a 27-year-old son but has never been married, decided to sell her three-bedroom semi in the Wirral, along with most of her possessions. CASCADE NEWS The former air stewardess and dog Milo try out a new camper van My perfect man hasn't turned up so I'm going to go and find him instead Single mum, Nicci Taylor \nShe bought a 24-year-old motorhome with some of the proceeds, planning to head north arranging dates en route. \n“My perfect man hasn’t turned up so I’m going to go and find him instead,” declared Nicci as she prepared to depart. \n“I am fed up with waiting. I just don’t want to be on my own any more.” \nProphetically, she added: “I had this dream when I was little that I was going to marry a prince and live in a castle.” \nEven before she set off Nicci was inundated with offers from strangers, including several marriage proposals. But she was determined to head to Scotland, because she has a soft spot for the accent from her time living in Edinburgh when she was an air stewardess. CASCADE NEWS Nicci with all her belongings which she sold \nNicci, who’d never driven a camper van before, charted her progress online in a blog called Milo & Me and quickly built up a large following of fans. \nThey laughed as Nicci admitted she’d packed her favourite little black dress and shared her disappointment as the first few dates ended in failure. It seemed her quest for love was doomed. \nNicci said: “I got things like ‘I’ll meet you on the A66, love. I’ll ditch the wife and we’ll have some fun in a lay-by.’ It wasn’t quite what I had in mind!” \nThen, she revealed in August that she’d met “Mr P” and they were having a whirlwind romance. He turned out to be James Pollard who grew up in the home counties but is now embracing the lifestyle of a Scottish laird, complete with kilt, near John O’Groats. \nMr Pollard, the privately educated son of a lawyer, has been single following his divorce 10 years ago and approached Nicci when he saw her picture and story on the internet. \nHe confessed: \"I did think ‘Cor’ to start with, but also ‘What grit this women has.’ I didn’t think I had much of a chance because I live pretty much at the end of the line. I thought she would be snapped up long before she got here.” GETTY After Nicci embraced the lifestyle of a Scottish laird, she reveals she's single again \nNicci, who’d never driven a camper van before, charted her progress online in a blog called Milo & Me and quickly built up a large following of fans. \nThey laughed as Nicci admitted she’d packed her favourite little black dress and shared her disappointment as the first few dates ended in failure.

I thought she would be snapped up long before she got here.” GETTY Nicci hits the road again in search for love and new adventures \nBut the deal was sealed when he offered to show Nicci his falcons and she was soon burning up the miles to Caithness. \nFor Nicci the eligible Mr P ticked most of the boxes, albeit his baronial home is not quite a castle. Matters got off to a tentative start, with a coffee and a tour of his estate, but within four days they had shared their first kiss and he invited her to stay. \n“I believe I’ve met someone special,” she confided to her internet followers, describing him as “a perfect gentleman”. A beaming Nicci, who was soon pictured in tweeds and wellies, said there was an “instant attraction”. \nFor a few blissful weeks it appeared to be a case of happily-ever-after and recently the pair declared their love during an appearance on ITV’s This Morning programme. Amid jibes that she was a “golddigger”, Nicci wrote of her plans to find a part-time job so she was not reliant on Mr P. \nHowever, behind the scenes all was not well. The first hint of trouble was on Nicci’s blog where she wrote of “feeling lost” and later confessed: “I’ve spent so long at the ‘Big House’ trying to fit in and feel at home.” \nA few days later she told her disappointed followers that she was taking a break from blogging. James was said to be “uncomfortable” with being in the public glare and didn’t share her zest for baring so many details of their life. \nHe is said to be a private and rather reserved man while Nicci – who describes herself as “crazy, confused and always searching”– is vivacious and brash. In the past she’s put herself up for sale on eBay and offered Milo for rehoming along with herself. \nReluctantly, Nicci agreed but admitted she was “rather sad” to be no longer in the limelight. Sadly, the blogging blackout was not sufficient. \nOnce the initial excitement had subsided it seems that the pair were simply polar opposites. It is thought there was also resistance from some of his circle of friends, but Nicci claims she took the decision to nip the affair in the bud. \nThe final straw is said to have been a visit from an old pal she had known since their sons were at school together. The pair drank wine in front of a roaring fire, rode a quad bike and acted out a noisy rodeo display using an old saddle they discovered in a barn. \nAfter her friend had gone it dawned on Nicci just how isolated she was playing the country wife in a sprawling house where she couldn’t even find the tin-opener. It has also emerged that the weather wasn’t to her liking. \nFollowing the split Nicci was at least able to resume blogging, writing rather cryptically: “It really is an unusual story and one that I am unable, at this point, to share in full. \n“Mr P was a good person as am I. Sadly, we couldn’t be good together. Sometimes it is just as simple as the person you thought you knew just isn’t. \n“But you think to yourself I can deal with this, I can make this work, I won’t give up. Then you realise you’re not coping, it is not working and you have to stop. I chose to end this for both our sakes. \n“The people close to me have an insight to a small percentage of what happened, the rest is just a mess in my head.” \nIt is predicted that Nicci could secure a lucrative book deal, while her unusual quest for love would also make a perfect Hollywood rom-com. For his part James is keeping his counsel about why their Highland fling turned sour. \nUndaunted, Nicci and her faithful companion are now back on the road, determined to “reignite” their adventure and still chasing her dream of finding the special one. \nIn her latest blog entry – entitled “Just Milo & Me”– Nicci says: “We have no idea what to do next or where to go. We have no plan. I for one am feeling pretty scared for my future and am hoping I will wake up tomorrow with a bloomin’ good idea.” \nFairytales, unfortunately, very rarely come true.
