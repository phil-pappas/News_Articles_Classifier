It’s pristine, too: Six of the beaches along its 18 miles of coast are “Blue Wave Certified.” And the shore that lines it? Breathtaking sugar-white beaches that stretch on and on.\nThe Bradenton Gulf Islands are magical: You won’t see any chain restaurants, and you’ll get to know plenty of family restaurant owners. The coastal enclave sits just 20 minutes from Sarasota airport, which means with a JetBlue direct flight from Boston, you can dream your escape for a few hours in the air and then be in the thick of it.\nThere are a few other things you won’t find here. Like a wild spring break scene. Or a long row of chain stores. Or high-rise buildings. But if you’re into fresh seafood, delightful waterfront activities, cool artist communities, bustling in a kicked-back-way main streets, and a feeling of getting away — this is the place.\nIt’s a place where buildings are simple yet beautiful. With no building more than three stories high, no chain restaurants or mega-businesses, Anna Maria Island is a community of mom and pop. You’ll meander down streets, finding great food and art but also meeting those who create it. Where to stay? In this region, it’s nearly impossible to go wrong among the many quaint, quality choices in breathtaking spots.\nLike the Tortuga Inn Beach Resort on Anna Maria Island (1325 Gulf Drive N., 941-778-6611). With six distinct buildings, the inn offers accommodations for every need — with a private spa or overlooking one of the common pools. Gulf views abound, and there are three heated pools and a boat dock. Those spectacular Sun Coast sunsets are so breathtaking they’ll send you racing for your camera.\nIn the mood of the region, fun comes at a natural pace: casting a line from the beach with a great blue heron standing guard over your bait bucket … or listening to an osprey’s cry when it lifts off from the sea with a fish in its talons ... or watching a pair of young dolphins play in the surf … or standing in silence as flocks of cormorants stream past at the edge of the strand. Learn more at www.tortugainn.com.\nAt the Bungalow Beach Resort on Anna Maria Island (2000 Gulf Drive N., 941-778-3600) you’ll be tucked up along that white sand beach in a setting that’s modern in amenities and old-school in vibe. The gracious rejuvenated classic 1930s-style resort is nestled among the white sand dunes, sea oats and swaying coconut palms. It has its own private beach area, dotted with lounge chairs and umbrellas.\nThe private hedged-and-gated grounds of the Bungalow Beach Resort are elegantly manicured, featuring 30 different exotic palms and tropical flowers. A sparkling heated pool includes a waterfall and cabana area for small private entertaining. There’s also another private heated pool with rental of the Island Pool Home.\nSounds award-worthy, right? That’s because it is, having recently garnered two prestigious national awards, recognized for its ongoing hospitality leadership with the 2015 TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence as well as the 2015 White Glove Award from the Superior Small Lodging Association.\nThe TripAdvisor award celebrates properties that consistently achieve outstanding traveler reviews on the company’s website over a 12-month period, as well as that business’ tenure and ranking on the site’s Popularity Index. Bungalow Beach Resort has received the award four years in a row. The White Glove Award was created to distinguish hotels and resorts whose housekeeping standards are rated beyond exceptional by the Superior Small Lodging Association (an association for boutique hotels).\n“We pride ourselves on our motto of ‘Nothing Broken, Nothing Dirty’ to deliver a consistently exceptional hotel experience for our guests, and we are proud to be recognized for our ongoing commitment to cleanliness and personalized service,” said longtime owner Gayle Luper. “The TripAdvisor award is truly a people’s choice award, based on our long history of positive reviews by our visitors. It is an honor to our staff and the exceptional resort getaway experience they provide our guests.”\nAdditionally, under Luper’s leadership, Bungalow Beach Resort has won numerous awards including the “Top Romance in U.S.” Traveler’s Choice Award (also from TripAdvisor) and several White Glove Awards from the Florida Superior Small Lodging Association. Learn more at www.bungalowbeach.com.\nThe Mainsail Beach Inn, built in 2009, is another top choice (101 66th St., Bradenton Beach, 888-849-2642). Thanks to its enviable location, the Mainsail Beach Inn offers a one-of-a-kind Florida beachfront resort experience. The resort makes the most of Anna Maria Island’s unique fusion of natural wonders, outdoor recreation and Old Florida coastal charm — the best of life along Florida’s Gulf Coast.\nThe inn has 12 upscale two- and three-bedroom residences, each with its own balcony or deck and most with beachfront access. All units come with gourmet kitchens and professional appliances, hardwood floors, elegant furnishings, fine linens, flat screen plasma televisions, DVD players, sound systems and high-speed Internet access.\nAmenities include a private sun deck with a heated resort-style pool, a gazebo with outdoor kitchen and grill, beach chairs and umbrellas. And the Mainsail’s nearby marina features 50 slips accommodating vessels up to 50 feet in length and available for daily, weekly or monthly rentals. The marina is just a short stroll from the island’s exclusive restaurants and retail shops. Boat rentals and fishing guides are also available.\nTop that off with a complimentary shuttle to bring you to all the cozy spots you’ll want to explore around the island and you’ve got perfection. Learn more at www.mainsailbeachinn.com.\nSilver Resorts offer two choices of oasis in Bradenton Beach, the BridgeWalk (100 Bridge St., 941-779-2545), a landmark resort, and the Silver Surf (1301 Gulf Drive N., 941-778-6626), which recently debuted an updated look.\nSilver Surf has 50 charming units located just across the street from its own private beach. Silver Surf’s design lends itself to meeting new people during your stay, with a touch of Florida “the way it used to be.” Sit on your open patio if you are staying in an Aparto and soak in the sun while you people-watch, take a dip in the outdoor heated pool or just relax on the beach and read the book you have been putting off for too long. If you are looking for some action, you can rent a Jet ski, catamaran, paddleboard or kayak on Silver Surf’s private beach from Coastal Watersports. Tiki massage is also available on the beach by SeaRenity Spa.\nA majority of the rooms at the Bridgewalk Anna Maria resort exceed 800 square feet — plus a very large screened verandah. All rooms have tile floors and granite countertops and nearly all the rooms at Bridgewalk have Jacuzzi tubs. Property amenities include a heated outdoor pool, complimentary beach towels, chairs and umbrellas, continental breakfast, a restaurant/island bar and a spa on the property, as well as several retail stores. It’s location, Bridge Street, is special, too.\nBridge Street is where folks stepped foot on the island many years ago via a wood-plank bridge. Today, the street is lined with shops, restaurants and bars. There is even a radio station that broadcasts local information and promotes area musicians.\nAt one end of Bridge Street is the Bradenton Beach Fishing Pier and Clock Tower, where the time is only noted when the clock rings.\nThe other end of this narrow street offers access to a beautiful white sand beach where you can sit for hours reading a book, watching the dolphins play or doing nothing at all.\nLearn more at www.silverresorts.com.\nWith such splendid accommodations, it’s easy to just settle in. But you’ll want to get out. With so much to discover in such a warm embracing way, it’s worth exploring.\nOn Pine Avenue, called the Greenest Little Main Street in America, you’ll find 1920s bungalows that are now home to boutiques, restaurants and other businesses, where you’ll often find the owner at the door ready to chat. There’s a wonderful pier to meander down, and the streets are busy enough to be fun but quiet enough to make renting a bike and pedaling along them totally safe. It’s movie-set perfect.\nAnd then there’s the food. Not only does the region embrace farm-to-table, it embraces surf-to-table. Some restaurants allow guests to “hook and cook”: You fish, bring in your catch and have it prepared by one of the region’s amazing chefs. Now that’s a vacation memory.\nA culinary leader is the Chiles group and its three iconic, waterfront restaurants — The Sandbar on Anna Maria Island (100 Spring Ave., 941-778-0444), the Beach House Restaurant (200 Gulf Drive N., Bradenton Beach, 941-779-2222) and Mar Vista Dockside Restaurant on North Longboat Key (760 Broadway St., 941-383-2391), operated by local sustainability expert Ed Chiles, son of the late Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles.\nThe settings alone are sublime: The Sandbar restaurant began as a bathhouse structure in 1922. The Beach House was originally a Harbor House; Chiles purchased the property in 1993. Mar Vista is one of the 12 oldest surviving structures on Longboat Key. Construction began in the 1910s.\nChiles also owns the Studio at Gulf and Pine, the island’s cultural art gallery and event facility. Ed Chiles’ mother, Rhea Chiles, founded the Studio.\nProducts Chiles serves in his restaurants include farm-to-fork wares from Gamble Creek Farm — a 26-acre farm located in Parrish, Fla., that grows hydroponic and organic produce. Mullet, one of the most under-appreciated fish and one of the healthiest, is high in Omega 3 fatty acids. Chiles receives the fresh fish from area fishermen. Learn more about the Chiles group at www.groupersandwich.com.\nYou may never want to leave Anna Maria, but Bradenton has plenty to offer, too. Such as the South Florida Museum (201 10th St. W., 941-746-4131). The museum is also home to the Bishop Planetarium and the Parker Manatee Aquarium (with a rehab center worth visiting and a 60-plus-year-old manatee named Snooty you can get to know).\nThe town is centered with its River Walk along the Manatee River, the site of local events, including the Bradenton Blues Festival in early December and the Bradenton River Regatta in February. Regatta week also features events like extreme pogo (it’s just what it says it is!), a Frisbee dog event, concerts and more.\nThe Artists Village there, is a must-see. Said to be the longest working artists area in America, it’s a line of 1920s cottages inhabited by artists who are living for their work and who open their doors to share it with you. And, of course, there is shopping — with lots of boutiques that mirror the feel of the region; colorful and fresh, unique and fun. If you want a taste of upscale shopping, you can visit the Ellington Outlet Mall there as well.\nA visit to Mixon Fruit Farms (2525 27th St. E, Bradenton, 941-748-5829) is a must. Not only can you purchase fruit right at the grove, you can tour the grove, learn about how it works and more. Dean and Janet Mixon are happy to share a portion of their citrus grove with Wildlife Inc. for a Florida Wildlife Care & Education Center, providing much needed land and shelter for orphaned and injured birds, animals and reptiles. Their mission is to rehabilitate Florida wildlife for release back into the wild, and to promote education, appreciation and respect for wildlife. Cages are built in the grove next to orange trees as the family-owned-and-operated business embraces the Florida Wildlife Preserve. All visitors are invited to meet the animals up-close. You go away inspired by the beauty of these creatures. The animals and birds come and go as they are treated and rehabilitated. Some are released back into the wild and some must find a permanent rescue home. You can learn about it all, and of course, shop for some incredible fresh Florida grown goodies while there. And since the Mixons ship their fruit, you can “revisit” them from your home all year long. Learn more at www.mixon.com.\nThen there is Long Boat Key, just south of Anna Maria Island. Quiet and secluded, it is full of pristine beaches and some fine-dining choices.\nThe entire region is about embracing the simple things in life. Want to get around? Use a free trolley, rent a bike or even rent a golf cart! Want to stay in a private home instead of a hotel and cook in more? There are shopping services that will fill your fridge before you arrive. Most of all, the Bradenton Gulf Islands want you to unhook, disconnect and breath it all in. On the sparking beaches of the Bradenton area, where the water is almost always within view and the living and vacationing is serene, you can just breathe deep, mellow out and go with the flow.
