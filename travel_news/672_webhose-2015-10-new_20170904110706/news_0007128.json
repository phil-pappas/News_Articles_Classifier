Back in the Dutch Golden Age, they were called self-portraits and were the preserve of highly trained artists who thought long and hard about every aspect of the painting.\nNow the Mauritshuis museum is staging an exhibition focusing solely on these 17th-century self-portraits, highlighting the similarities and the differences between modern-day snapshots and historic works of art.\nThe museum’s director, Emilie Gordenker, said there has never been such an exhibition of Golden Age Dutch self-portraits before, and her museum was keen to tie the paintings to a modern-day phenomenon: the ubiquitous selfies captured with smartphone cameras and spread via social media.\nThe exhibition, which continues through Jan. 3, features 27 self-portraits by artists ranging from Rembrandt van Rijn, a master of the genre, to his student Carel Fabritius — best known for The Goldfinch , which hangs elsewhere in the Mauritshuis — and Judith Leyster, whose self-portrait is on loan from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.\nWhile the similarities between selfies and self-portraits are obvious — the subject matter is the person creating the image — the differences are also apparent. A selfie is often shot speedily with little concern for composition, while these self-portraits are carefully conceived works of art. A video made for the exhibition highlights the thought that went into the paintings and what today’s selfie makers can learn from it to improve their snapshots.\nAnd, yes, you are allowed to take selfies in the museum.\nMike Corder,\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:13:57.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
