Beyond the obvious economic value, they bring people together to exchange knowledge and ideas, build business relationships and over the long term attract investment and talent flows,” she says\n \n“There’s intense competition for hosting business events globally and we are upping our game to compete to bring the world’s top minds here to help our city and country benefit.”\n \nACB introduced New Zealand’s first business events advocate programme earlier this year as a key deliverable from the Auckland Business Events Plan to help bolster Auckland’s presence on the global stage as a world-class destination for hosting business events.\n \n“We now have 14 distinguished thought leaders as part of the Auckland Advocate Alliance representing sectors spanning health, medical, education and ICT that we are working closely with to bid for international events,” Mrs Hayward says.\n \n“Advocate programmes abroad are highly successful and essential in achieving on-going success in the highly competitive business events sector, and our Auckland advocates already have a proven track record in attracting conferences here.”\n \nAuckland has benefited from impressive growth in the business events sector. In 2013, the sector contributed $236 million in direct spend to the Auckland economy. The aim of the Auckland Business Events Plan is to double that figure by 2023 and increase delegate days from 1.98 million in 2013 to 2.55 million.\n \nLisa Gardiner, Tourism New Zealand International Business Events and Premium Manager says the international business events sector, particularly international conferences and incentives, holds great potential to attract new high value international visitors to New Zealand.\n \n“Tourism New Zealand has significantly increased its work in the business events sector and in the year ended June 2015 achieved a new milestone of 23 international conference wins for the year, which will see an additional $27 million injected into the New Zealand economy in the coming years.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:41:33.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
