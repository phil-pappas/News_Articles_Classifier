Even at 82, she longs for the pole position and taking the checkered flag, even though she no longer drives the open road around her hometown. Recently, Wish of a Lifetime and Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) provided Dorothy the opportunity to take a spin around the Texas Motor Speedway in an Indy race car, something she's always wanted to experience.\nDorothy is a resident of Brookdale Midwestern in Wichita Falls, Texas . After a few laps, she shared with some community associates that she didn't realize she was going to go 160 mph around the racetrack and \"lost her shoe\" on a couple curves. She stated that the fastest she had ever previously driven was 100 mph on a German autobahn.\nDuring some of her earlier years, Dorothy didn't have a driver's license because she and her husband shared one car and he was the primary driver. She longed for the freedom of the open road and eventually learned to drive while her husband was in the service and they were stationed in Japan . While living there, Dorothy spent her time volunteering for the Red Cross. She has relied on her faith throughout her life and devoted most of her life to serving others. It was all systems go when she was given the opportunity to make a pit stop at the Texas Motor Speedway for her special day.\nIn 2010, Brookdale Senior Living and Wish of a Lifetime formed a partnership to provide a helping hand in making some of the dreams of Brookdale's residents come true. To request a Wish, residents fill out a Wish application explaining an experience they would like to have fulfilled and how that experience relates to one or more dimensions of Brookdale's Optimum Life ® platform. Optimum Life cultivates whole-person wellness through fulfillment in the six key dimensions: purposeful, emotional, physical, social, spiritual and intellectual. Since the partnership's inception, more than 600 Brookdale seniors have had their Wish granted.\nFor more information about Brookdale and Wish of a Lifetime visit brookdale.com and seniorwish.org .\nAbout Brookdale\nBrookdale Senior Living Inc. is the leading operator of senior living communities throughout the United States .
