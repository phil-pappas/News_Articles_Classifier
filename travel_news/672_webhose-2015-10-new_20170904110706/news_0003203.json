For the past five years, Lancome has partnered with St. Jude through various fundraising efforts and is now elevating and expanding their support. The Moments of Happiness campaign will begin this month and will include regional in-store events with celebrity makeup artist Mickey Williams , an interactive social media \"hand heart\" campaign and nationwide fundraising efforts that will benefit St. Jude throughout the year. \"Finding a way to bring moments of happiness to children with life-threatening illnesses and their families, with joy and grace, is a delicate balance,\" says Lancome ambassadress Julia Roberts . \"I applaud the work that Lancome is doing with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\" From October 18th to October 24th , the brand will donate $1 directly to St. Jude for every transaction made on Lancome-usa.com and at counters nationwide. This includes bestsellers such as La Vie Est Belle, a fragrance collection that embodies happiness, and two products known for award winning innovation - Definicils Mascara and the Genifique skincare collection. A limited-edition bracelet will also be offered at counters for incremental donations. \" Our work with St. Jude began in 2010, and every year, it ' s becoming bigger and bigger, and better and better, \" says Xavier Vey , President of Lanc o me USA . \" It ' s a very important partnership for Lanc o me. It was rooted in a strong, shared belief in research and innovation that can transform lives. But that was just the beginning. For these families facing difficult times, we bring a slight moment of happiness. And that ' s fundamental for Lanc o me, because the brand is all about bringing happiness beyond beauty. We like to say that at Lanc o me, you come to a counter to look more beautiful, but you leave happier. \" St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is leading the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer and other life-threatening diseases. The majority of funding for St. Jude comes from individual contributions through programs like this, and helps ensure families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food - because all a family should worry about is helping their child live. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:19:09.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
