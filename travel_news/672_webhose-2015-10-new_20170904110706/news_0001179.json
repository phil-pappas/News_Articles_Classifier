The perceived threats against Superyachts within the Mediterranean from acts of terrorism are also a growing concern.\nCompanies sending crew members to classroom-based security courses can be both inflexible and not cost effective. Skills 4 Security & Training Limited, a UK-based, MCA Approved Company has recently launched an eLearning Superyacht Security Awareness Training course. The course is specifically designed for the instruction of all crew members, allowing easy access to learning online any time, in any location. It is also CPD accredited, adding extra value as it is an international recognition of learning and increases career enhancement.\nSheldon Kaye , Marketing Director at S4ST says \"Our course was created by subject matter experts to be able to offer management companies and owners of luxury vessels a simple, yet effective method of training, ensuring their crew possess sufficient knowledge of the threats and risks both at sea and in port\". Kaye added \"We believe that our e-learning course builds upon knowledge gained by Superyacht crew during industry standard STCW ISPS training, taking a more in-depth look at the unique security requirements of Superyachts\".\nThe course includes recognition, planning, preparation phases, counter-piracy planning and countermeasures, as well as procedures that are in compliance with related documentation provided by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) and the requirement for counter-piracy planning.\nFor more details of the course and to book, please visit our website https://skills4security.com/superyacht-security-awareness-training.html\nSkills 4 Security & Training are a leading provider of accredited and bespoke training courses, specialising in commercial and private maritime security, hostile environment awareness training, personal security, health and safety and company compliance.
