Designed based on user feedback, the new dashboard provides registered business owners with insights and trend data about their reviews, ranking and competitors in an interactive online display. The Review Performance report analytics are designed to help businesses easily monitor and maximise their presence on TripAdvisor.\nThe Review Performance report offers improved functionality from existing analytics tools including the ability for businesses to track trends over time and to create their own competitor sets. The robust trend data and competitor analysis allows business owners to see how travellers are engaging with their listing on TripAdvisor and to easily identify actionable insights on operations and performance.\nMinesh Shah , senior director, global hotel partnerships, TripAdvisor said, “According to the recent research conducted by Atmosphere Research Group in partnership with TripAdvisor, highly engaged businesses get more visibility, have higher popularity rankings and receive more booking enquiries through TripAdvisor. In fact, highly engaged hotels receive almost four times more page views and are on average 63 per cent higher in popularity ranking than non-engaged hotels.”\nFor the first time, restaurant and attraction businesses will also be able to track their performance against their competitors on TripAdvisor, analytics previously only available to accommodation providers. Through the Review Performance report, all businesses registered on TripAdvisor are now able to easily monitor competitor performance in weekly, monthly and quarterly displays.\nShah continued, “The Review Performance report has been designed to make it is easier for businesses to engage with their TripAdvisor listing and their guest feedback. What makes this new dashboard so valuable for registered business owners is that it automatically aggregates performance trends and presents them in an easy-to-digest display, placing valuable learnings at their fingertips to help them drive engagement and optimize their presence on TripAdvisor.”\n 20, 2015 6:47 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:24:41.791+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
