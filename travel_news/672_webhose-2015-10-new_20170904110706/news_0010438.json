Revenues fell to 17.13 billion patacas (S$3.01 billion) from 25.56 billion patacas a year earlier and down from 18.6 billion patacas in August, according to data released by the Macau government. \nAnalysts were expecting a decline of around 32-34 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:50:43.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
