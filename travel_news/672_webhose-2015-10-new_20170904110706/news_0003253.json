The emerging markets-focused bank attracted the interest of broker Investec as analysts sought to attribute the 26pc “surge” in the share price in recent trading sessions to “market enthusiasm” triggered by reports it was planning on slashing 1,000 of its top staff . Shares fell 23.2p, or 2.9pc, to 763.5p after the broker lowered its rating to “hold”. Although analysts reckon the bank’s share price is slightly cheap, they advised investors there is “much clearer” value elsewhere. Ian Gordon, of Investec, cautioned: “Despite a raft of recent downgrades, consensus revenue and earnings forecasts remain far too high, in our view.” While brokers have been playing “catch-up” when it comes to rerating the stock, Investec said it continues to model “a far worse outcome” for the income statement than existing consensus assumptions. “We do not expect revenues and earnings per share to start to grow again until 2017 - consensus models a recovery from 2016,” Mr Gordon added. Only last month, Standard Chartered found itself under renewed regulatory scrutiny for its exposure to Iran , as reports surfaced the bank was reviewing clients in 2013 to determine if they were Iranian or Iran-connected entities. In the last quarter, 38pc was wiped off the stock, as Asian exposure and concerns it would be forced into raising up to $9bn plagued the bank. On the wider market, the jubilation of last week’s 4.67pc gain - its biggest in almost four years - was short lived, as the FTSE 100 opened the week in negative territory. The blue chip index experienced its first daily loss in nine consecutive trading sessions, as mining stocks came under pressure once more. It fell 44.98 points, or 0.7pc, to 6,371.18. David Madden, of IG, said: “The losses in the mining sector are relatively small when compared with the losses it registered recently, but dealers are looking ahead to Chinese trade balance figures due overnight, and they are not taking any chances.” Despite opening in positive territory, Glencore tumbled into the red as it announced plans to sell its Cobar copper mine in Australia and its Lomas Bayas copper mine in Chile after receiving interest from possible buyers. On Friday, the Switzerland-based company said it would curtail 500,000 tonnes of zinc production - 4pc of global mine supply - next year. Analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove said the key near-term catalyst for the mining and trading group is the outcome of targeted disposals. The investment bank reckons precious metals deals and the 100pc sale of its agriculture business could generate proceeds of more than $10bn. Shares in the miner slid 6.2pc to 121.2p. Other commodity firms including Anglo American (down 4.8pc to 691.7p) and Antofagasta (3.3pc lower at 576.5p) were also among the heaviest fallers. FTSE 100 engineer Rolls Royce was among the laggards, hurt by reports EU regulators are investigating whether airlines are being forced to enter anti-competitive contracts. The stock tumbled 29.5p, or 3.9pc, to 726p. Whitbread , owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, also edged lower, down 39p to £46.82, following a bearish note from Panmure Gordon, ahead of its half-year results on October 20. The broker expects wage inflation to accelerate in the immediate term, after Costa Coffee raised staff wages ahead of next April’s introduction of the living wage. Analysts say mitigation plans, such as training, efficiencies and new rota systems, will take time to enact. The FTSE 100 company says it is still on track to add 5,500 rooms to Premier Inn hotels this year, but Panmure Gordon highlights such room additions follow a period of weaker-than-expected trading. Even though the hotel chain will benefit from the Rugby World Cup in the short term, analysts believe growth is slowing overall. British Airways owner, IAG , bucked the trend, advancing 7.5p to 570p, as Goldman Sachs began covering the stock again following the Aer Lingus acquisition. The investment bank issued a “buy” rating, as it expects the airline to deliver modest capacity growth and believes its current valuation fails to reflect its higher return and growth prospects. Support services company Carillion also made ground, up 11.8p to 313.5p, after it won £1.7bn worth of new business. Analysts at Liberum said the announcement should “reassure those that are fretting about trading”. Ahead of Wednesday's deal deadline, SABMiller lost 47p to close at £36.22 after AB InBev made an improved offer , of £43.50 per share, for the UK-listed brewer. With the deadline fast approaching, Chris Beauchamp, of IG, said: “The Belgian firm needs to go all out to avoid fumbling what could have been the big news of 2015 in the sector.” Elsewhere, infection control company Tristel ticked 9.5pc higher to 115.5p after it beat market forecasts to post full-year revenues of £15.3m - up 13.8pc on the previous year. Analysts at finnCap upgraded their forecasts for next year, as they believe international expansion is going to be “a major driving force” of the company’s future growth. Aim-listed consumer marketing business NAHL crept 3.9pc higher to 395p after splashing out £25m for Bush & Company Rehabilitation, a provider of specialist services to the catastrophic injuries market, in its biggest deal since listing last year. Finally, shares in investment vehicle Mithril , which is backed by billionaire property developer Nick Candy, were suspended pending a reverse takeover. The group has agreed to acquire digital media agency Agenda21 in deal worth £12m. It intends to cancel its listing on the Official List and seek re-admission of the company’s share to trading on AIM in due course. telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:18:40.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
