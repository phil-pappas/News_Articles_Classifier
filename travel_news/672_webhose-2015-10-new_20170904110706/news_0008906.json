It's a textile-block house, but with a few contributions of Mrs. Millard's: an ornate fire screen, wooden doors and 18th-century Delft tiles in the bathrooms. The neighborhood near this house is filled with Arts and Crafts-style homes and it's just a few blocks from the Greene and Greene masterpiece the Gamble House. \nLa Miniatura is built on three levels, with a double-height living room. It occupies 4,230 square feet and has four bedrooms, four baths, kitchen, living room and a formal dining room. A studio was added in 1926, designed by Wright's son Lloyd. Like many Wright projects, it overran its initial budget of $10,000, costing nearly $17,000 in the end. On sale in 2011, it was listed at just under $4,000,000. \nYou'll get to see a bunch of great photos of the house here in the website created by its realtor. It's enough to make me want to run right out and apply for a home loan. Wright's original elevation drawing is here and you can also see what it looked like during construction . \n645 Prospect CrescentPrivate residence, not open for tours Photo Credit: Â©2011 Betsy Malloy Photography.
