Sadly, my attempts to follow in their footsteps by booking into the $47,600-a-night Sultan Suite ends spectacularly when my credit card is declined and I scream: “But don’t you know who I am?!”\nThe Ciragan Palace Kempinski Hotel, Istanbul. Source: Supplied\nAlthough the superior Bosphorus View Room I eventually go for doesn’t have its own helipad or 24-hour private butler service, it’s still luxurious, and provides me with access to the hotel’s restaurants, pools and day spa, complete with traditional marble hammam. I’m not ashamed to say I spend my days relaxing in the heated infinity pool under the watchful eye of the Bosphorus Bridge, while a staffer I’ve decided will become my next husband feeds me cherry ice-cream from the stand parked right next to me.\nHagia Sophia Overlooking Bosphorus Source: ThinkStock\nIt’s difficult to leave the resort, but there’s a whole city out there to explore. The best way to see the hit list of Istanbul’s top sights without battling the city’s notorious traffic is to get on one of the Bosphorus harbour tours, which depart from the chic waterside village of Ortakoy (just a 10-minute walk from the hotel). The one-hour tour costs around $8 and takes you past all the pretty ruins and palaces that seem like they were bought online as part of a bulk lot.\nYou’ll probably notice some islands at this point. You should definitely visit Kiz Kulesi for a Turkish coffee with a view, as well as Suada Club, a bustling floating pontoon owned by Turkish football team Galatasaray that’s home to a handful of bars, restaurants and celebrities who should’ve gone home a long time ago. Further outwards in the Sea of Marmara, Buyukada, with its horse-and-carriage tours and seafood restaurants, is always my first stop whenever I’m in town. Give this a miss if you don’t like cats.\nLooking out of the Maiden's Tower (Kiz Kulesi in Turkish) in Istanbul. Source: News Corp Australia\nThese are all waterway destinations, of course. If you want to experience the Bosphorus like one of the 300,000-plus commuters who hit the water every day, you need to bags an outdoor seat on\na local ferry, accept that the simit-and-tea man is going to be your new best friend (yes, even on public transport the Turks are trying to feed you) and watch the sun set over the magical skyline as the seagulls chase you for that one last crumb. Heaven.\nRooms at Ciragan Palace Kempinski start from $834 per night, or\n$899 per night including buffet breakfast.
