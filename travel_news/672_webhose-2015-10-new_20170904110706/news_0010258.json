Cinnamon Lakeside is the perfect urban getaway where guests can indulge in the luxuries of resort life whilst within the city. It is also the most extraordinary business hotel in Colombo, housing the largest city swimming pool, spectacular landscaping, a floating restaurant, an aqua foot lounge, delectable international cuisine and inspiring event venues.Green Globe congratulates Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo on its recent re-certification for the fifth year in a row.\nCinnamon Lakeside’s environmental policy is based on compliance and resource conservation. The core goals for the hotel are to minimize costs and reduce the property’s impact on the environment. The environmental task force (Green Team) in collaboration with the hotel’s Engineering Department champions sustainable environmental practices within hotel operations. Greenhouse gas emissions produced by the hotel are measured as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – World Resource Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The measurement takes into account the greenhouse gas emissions and further global warming effects of the property, as well as business related travel, including contrail formation of flights according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 1999.\nThe scope of measurement is two pronged. Measuring direct emissions from sources that are owned and controlled by the hotel. And measuring indirect emissions mainly from electricity usage, which is sourced from the main grid.\nDuring the 2014/15 financial year, the hotel aimed to reduce its carbon footprint by targeting both direct and indirect emission sources. As a result, the hotel reduced its total carbon footprint from 6,354 to 6,317 metric tons. This was achieved through system improvements that consumed less diesel and furnace oil and a reduction in overall electricity consumption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:24:09.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
