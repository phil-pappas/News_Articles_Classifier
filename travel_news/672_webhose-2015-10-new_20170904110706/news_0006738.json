The group will also work to share best practices for documenting and responding to UAS incidents, and will consider how future procedures might enable safe commercial UAS uses at airports. The working group will also explore public outreach and education about the safe operation of UAS.\nThe working group is comprised of representatives from the following agencies:\n Denver International Airport\n The Federal Aviation Administration\n The Colorado Department of Transportation’s Aeronautics Division\n Centennial Airport\n Front Range Airport\n Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport\n The Denver Police Department\n The Federal Bureau of Investigation\n“Unmanned aircraft systems are creating unprecedented new tools for hobbyists and commercial uses, but operators who don’t follow the rules are creating a potentially dangerous situation for commercial aircraft,” said Ken Greene, DEN’s chief operating officer. “Safety is the No. 1 priority at Denver International Airport, and this working group will enable us to pool our collective resources and knowledge with our federal and regional\npartners to address this emerging technology.”\nUnder the FAA’s rules, recreational UAS users are required to stay below 400 feet and must contact air traffic controllers within five miles of any airport. Over the last three months, unauthorized UAS have been spotted on or near DEN property seven times at altitudes up to 3,660 feet and as close as 500 feet to approaching aircraft.\nDEN is asking the public to report UAS operations on or near the airport to local law enforcement to help discourage this dangerous, illegal activity. Anyone who spots a UAS on or near airport property is asked to call DEN police dispatchers at 303-342-4211. The FAA’s “Know Before You Fly” campaign educates unmanned aircraft users about where they can operate within the rules.\nSource:- Fly Denver", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:01:57.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
