Featured cameos from Chicago natives include Ozzie Guillen (former White Sox player), The O'My's ( Chicago -based band) and the world's best parkour athletes and dancers from Substance Over Hype . A custom soundtrack that features local Chicago artists including The O'My's will also accompany the film.\nOn the heels of \" French Kiss \" and \" Two Bellmen , \" \"Business Unusual,\" written and directed by Daniel Malakai Cabrera & Caine Sinclair , is the third original short film produced by the Marriott Content Studio. The studio has also produced two original YouTube Series for Marriott International, \" Hot Shoppe \" and \"Do Not Disturb.\" In addition, Renaissance Hotels is launching season two of its \" Navigator Live \" series October 21 , with AXS TV. The show follows touring musicians such as Awolnation, A-Track and The Lone Bellow -- modern business travelers -- as they discover Dallas , Long Beach and D.C. during their Renaissance Hotels stays.\n\"Brands must stop interrupting what consumers are interested in and become what they are interested in, and short films driven by storytelling vs. advertising are just one of the many ways we are engaging with next generation travelers,\" said David Beebe , Vice President, Global Creative + Content Marketing, for Marriott International and its portfolio of 19 brands. \"Not only do the short films and other projects from the Marriott Content Studio engage an audience, they inspire them to travel, and drive revenue for our hotels, and we've found the right recipe for mixing art and commerce together to win the hearts, minds, and wallets of travelers globally.\"\n\"Business Unusual\" centers around two ad executives and former colleagues, having just arrived in Chicago to compete against each other in a pitch. A pompous character, Chip, delivers the first pitch and receives extremely positive feedback from the clients. Following Chip's seemingly successful presentation, David, (a less seasoned entrepreneur) nervously begins to present his pitch-- when the client is suddenly called away to an emergency and is asked if he can finish the next day. David agrees and returns to his hotel. As he is anxiously preparing to revamp his pitch, the Navigator (Renaissance Hotels' local concierge) persuades him to join other guests for an evening of discovery through beverage, food and local music in the hotel's bar. Here he has a chance platonic encounter with a kind, wise, and successful woman named Ella. David finds his groove and is inspired to create an exceptionally fun and clever campaign, focused on the use of a Rube Goldberg machine that ultimately lands him the account. The Rube Goldberg machine in the film was designed by \"America's Got Talent\" quarterfinalist Steve Price .\n\"Renaissance Hotels is designed for the today's business travelers, who see travel as an opportunity to experience something new and unexpected, so they come away with a new perspective -- whether that's from experiencing the local neighborhood around our hotel or simply stumbling into a live performance, a mixology demonstration or an art exhibit in the programmed public spaces,\" said Dan Vinh , Vice President Marketing, Renaissance Hotels. \"'Business Unusual' incorporates cameos with strong Chicago ties to demonstrate the importance of Renaissance Hotel's passion for incorporating unexpected, indigenous and local elements into the guest experience.\"\nThe film's executive producers are David Beebe , Dan Vinh , Daniel Cabrera , Scott Ehrlich , William Spencer and Caine Sinclair .\nAbout Marriott International's Content Studio:\nLaunched in September 2014 , Marriott's Content Studio is dedicated to publishing, distributing and sharing digital content across multiple platforms and on all screens.
