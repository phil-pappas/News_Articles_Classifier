Since its opening in October 2014, the 400-key luxury hotel in the Lintong district of Xi’an has hosted a poolside Valentine’s Day party, a Mid-Autumn celebration that saw 80 hotel guests releasing sky lanterns in the courtyard, and a symphony orchestra concert for 300 hotel guests – also in the courtyard – in celebration of China’s National Day. The events were marketed as a room and/or dinner package. Angsana Xi’an Lintong’s general manager, Jerry Mong, told TTGmice that the events were an effective way of demonstrating the hotel’s MICE ability.“Our hotel sits on a large piece of land and has many beautiful open spaces, such as the courtyard. Our internal events utilise these spaces and they show the variety of activities that can be done here,” said Mong, adding that the events were captured on film which are used as part of the hotel’s marketing activities. Besides a ballroom for up to 800 guests and seven meeting rooms with spacious foyers, Angsana Xi’an Lintong also offers several outdoor venues such as landscaped gardens, indoor and outdoor pool decks, and a courtyard that can accommodate up to 1,000 pax for welcome receptions, gala dinners and teambuilding games. The hotel, whose architecture and layout are a modern interpretation of a Tang Dynasty court, was also the venue of the 2015 Banyan Tree General Manager Operation Review, an event in July that was attended by 200 general managers and directors of sales and marketing from the company’s properties worldwide. The delegation was welcomed by a royal procession that recalled the grandeur of the Tang Dynasty’s heyday, executed by 200 actors dressed in ancient garb and armed with elaborate props.“We planned that opening ceremony on our own, and it is proof that the hotel can facilitate strong welcome receptions for our clients,” Mong remarked. To celebrate the hotel’s first anniversary, a Halloween party has been planned for 300 hotel guests, trade partners and the media on October 31. It will be held at the soon-to-open Angsana Hot Spring Xi’an Lintong which sits next to the hotel. The two-storey complex features an indoor pool, 25 outdoor hot springs and private cabanas, among other facilities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:42:59.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
