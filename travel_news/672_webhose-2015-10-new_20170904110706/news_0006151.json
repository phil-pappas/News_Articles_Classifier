The good news: There are still ways to save money, as our Getaway column recently pointed out . Below are five quick tips that the column touched on. 1. Focus on Thanksgiving FTW. Relax, you’ve still got time to buy Thanksgiving tickets. Usually fares go up within 10 days of the holiday, according to the website Hopper. For the record, that makes your deadline Nov. 15. Procrastinate wisely. 2. Fly on Thanksgiving Day. This is a somewhat risky gambit, considering that a missed connection may result in missing the meal. But the savings may be worth it. Whatever you do, try to avoid flying the Wednesday before the holiday, one of the busiest and most expensive days to fly all year. 3. Click “Purchase” Nov. 6 or Nov. 7. Orbitz estimates that those are the best days to buy tickets for Christmas and New Year’s Eve travel. 4. Don’t Fly the Weekends After Christmas. Tickets for the weekends of Dec. 26 and Dec. 27 and Jan. 2 and Jan. 3 are going to be the most expensive, according to Hopper.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:33:07.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
