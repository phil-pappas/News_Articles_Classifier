AHIP is funding the expansion with cash on hand and the issuance of US$300,000 in AHIP units from treasury. The units are being issued at the 5-day volume-weighted average trading price.\nThe expansion is part of AHIP’s previously announced growth strategy of constructing additional guestrooms at existing, high-occupancy Oak Tree Inn railway hotels. The Dexter Property, which currently has over 100% occupancy, is the first location to get the additional guestrooms. The expansion was completed by SunOne Developments Inc. (“SunOne”) pursuant to the Master Development Agreement. SunOne is also presently constructing a 24-room expansion at the Oak Tree Inn in Glendive, Montana (the “Glendive Property”), which is expected to be delivered by year end.\nMr. Rob O’Neill, Chief Executive Officer of AHIP commented, “Our organic growth strategy is enabling AHIP to capture additional demand at existing, high-occupancy railway hotels. The Dexter Property is immediately benefitting from the increased room capacity and the Glendive Property expansion will also drive increased revenues at that hotel. Management has identified three additional existing Oak Tree Inn locations that may be suitable candidates for expansion in 2016. All new guestrooms will be purpose built to industry leading Oak Tree Inn standards and are expected to be immediately accretive to unitholders.”\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nCertain statements contained in this news release may constitute forward-looking statements.
