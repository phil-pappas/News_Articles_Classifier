More importantly, by acquiring them (we are acquiring) exceptional management teams, people such as Depak Deva (CEO, Destination Management India and South Asia of Kuoni Travel India) and Vishal Suri (CEO, SOTC). \n\n“With the Hong Kong acquisition, we’ll grow organically. Asia is where the action is going to be. China, Indonesia and India are primary travel source markets for the next few years, while South-east Asia is also going to be a stronger inbound market. So now, we will expand further into Asia by looking at other opportunities. But while we will be a mass market player in India, we want to be niche in Asia.” \n\nMenon is eyeing “well-run” niche travel businesses which will be allowed independence post-purchase. “We don’t have the ability to run them. It’s never our policy to interfere. It’s the same when we were acquired by Fairfax and it’s exactly what we’ll replicate,” he said. \n\nSOTC, Sita and Kuoni Hong Kong will remain independent, he said. The Kuoni name is licensed to Fairfax/Thomas Cook India for one year in India and five years in Hong Kong, but brands such as SOTC, Sita and Distant Frontiers are transferred. \n\n“For businesses that are retail and customer-facing, I don’t want to tangle with the customer. Let them choose which (brand) they want to buy from.” \n\nAsked about the future of tour operating, since Kuoni wanted out, he said: “There’s a future absolutely. Kuoni sold off for totally different reasons: it wants to concentrate on the B2B space and focus on its DMCs. I don’t have a problem with that. I believe there is a future as a packaged tour provider, and when it comes to complex itineraries, you need the balance between bricks-and-mortar and digital. That’s what we will provide.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:15:45.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
