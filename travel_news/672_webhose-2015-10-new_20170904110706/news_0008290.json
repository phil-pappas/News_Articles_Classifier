The same routine everyday does bring quite an amount of money but what is the use of money if we are not happy. The same is with the busy life of Kolkata, where a weekend getaway is like a breath of fresh air. \nYou will get a number of options being a Calcuttan starting from the fresh air of the Himalayas or the lush greenery of forests. Besides you can also opt for sea beaches or river banks as weekend getaways from Kolkata; Tarakeshwar - \nThis is a very important place of worship especially for the Shavite sect. This is a beautiful temple on the banks of Ganges. It was built by Raja Bharamalla in the 18th Century. The temple can be visited the whole year round but the time of Shivaratri has a different charm altogether. There is also a fair that is organised at this time every year. Monday is considered to be the most auspicious day and bathing in the Dudhpukur Tank is said to be holy. It is said that the waters of the tank have divine powers which can fulfil your wishes. The Buddha temple nearby is also an attraction here. The Tarakeshwar Lodge is the only option to stay here though it wonâ€™t provide you with any fancy facilities. Kamarpukur - \nSituated on the banks of the river Damodar, this is the birthplace of the great saint Dri Ramakrishna Paramhansa. The best attraction here is of course the temple dedicated to the saint with a beautiful marble statue of his holiness. Other than that there is also a library, dispensary and a school. The jute mill you find here is there to train young people and make them aware of our heritage. This is a nice and simple option among weekend getaways from Kolkata and the Deer Park is a cherry on the cake. Tarapith - \nOn the banks of the Dwaraka River, this is a small village in the Birbhum District of West Bengal. The village is famous mainly for the beautiful temple of Maa Tara, a form of Goddess Kali. It is also a place where tantriks and astrologers crowd as this is their cult deity. There are two different idols of the goddess here. One is the stone idol in the Mother Goddess form and the other is the metal idol in the fiery form. The ashram of Bamakhepa is adjacent to the temple. Bamakhepa was an ascetic who devoted his whole life in the devotion of the Goddess.
