Cats and dogs weighing, together with their carriers, 20 pounds or less are now welcome on Northeast Regional service, which runs between Boston and Lynchburg, Newport News and Norfolk in Virginia, as well as Downeaster trains running between Boston and Brunswick, Me. The test Pet Pilot Program will run through Feb. 15, 2016, after which Amtrak will determine whether to continue it. Pet passage was introduced on trains in Illinois in 2014; during that year, 200 animals rode the rails. Passengers are limited to one animal each and charged $25 to carry one on.\nAN INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL AT HOUSTON HOBBY\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
