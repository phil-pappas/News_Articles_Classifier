The show first signed an agreement with the integrated resort from 2014 – 2016, where Marina Bay Sands was announced as the official venue and official hotel.\nThe next four editions of ITB Asia will therefore continue to take place at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands, from 19 – 21 October 2016, 25 – 27 October 2017, 17 – 19 October 2018, 16 – 18 October 2019.\n“This extension demonstrates our ongoing commitment to take ITB Asia to the next level. Marina Bay Sands is renowned for creating extraordinary experiences by providing superior service, amenities and state-of-the-art conference facilities and we have forged an excellent working relationship over the past few years. We will continue to harness the expertise and synergies to create an optimal business environment for our delegates and lift the overall offering of our show to exhibitors, buyers and attendees,” said Katrina Leung, Executive Director of Messe Berlin (Singapore), the organisers of ITB Asia.\nThe eighth ITB Asia came to a close today with 760 exhibitors from 73 countries, with close to 880 buyers and attracted more than 10,300 attendees over the three days. Organisers expect to expand the show in 2016 and will continue successful elements such as the on-floor Travel & Technology Showcase. ITB Asia will also be introducing new features such as a Destination Showcase where destinations can highlight their unique offerings to attendees.\nOver the last two years, ITB Asia has also worked closely with Marina Bay Sands to help reduce the show’s carbon footprint. For example choosing food items sourced regionally, utilising newly activated in-room motion sensors to ensure maximum lighting efficiency in the meeting rooms, and setting the room temperature to 24 degree Celsius for optimal energy usage.\n“It has been our privilege to work with the organisers of ITB Asia over the past few years. The synergy, mutual understanding and rapport we enjoy has built a strong foundation for the travel trade show, and contributed to successful editions, year after year. We are humbled and encouraged by their strong support and look forward to scaling new heights together in the next three years,” said Mr. George Tanasijevich, President and CEO of Marina Bay Sands.\nAs a hybrid show, ITB Asia attracts delegates from across all sectors of the travel industry, including MICE, corporate and leisure companies. It acts as a platform for delegates to network and identify new business opportunities. The show’s powerful line up of conference programme also helps to provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the latest trends, issues and opportunities in the sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:00:50.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
