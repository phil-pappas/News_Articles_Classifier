Initially there was 60 people on-board affected,” said Michael McNerney from Sequim, Washington. “They were overwhelmed.”\n“We’ve stopped at four ports and every day there was people being taken off with the ambulances and stuff,” said passenger Chuck Woodcock from Seattle.\nOf the 2,590 passengers on board there were five with active symptoms, said Karen Candy, a spokesperson for Princess Cruises in an e-mail to CBC.\n“In order to interrupt the spread of illness, we proactively initiated an extensive sanitation campaign onboard … isolating ill guests in staterooms until they are non-contagious.”\nPassengers aboard the Star Princess like Tilly Enarson from Abbotsford say the crew made a big effort to keep norovirus from spreading. (CBC) While at sea Tilly Enarson, who is from Abbotsford, noticed crew members started taking precautions to avoid more infections.\nAfter a 6 a.m. PT arrival, both the ship and dock were scheduled to be scrubbed and disinfected before the Star Princess left for California.\nAny outbreak of norovirus exceeding three per cent requires special protocol and disinfection of the vessel. Officials say the number of people on the Star Princess who reported illness was fewer than the three per cent cut-off — in this case, 78 people.\nThe Star Princess has 17 decks, four pools and nine whirlpool spas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:35:05.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
