Updated Articles and Resources \nWhen you’re on the road for business or pleasure, the first thing that goes by the wayside is your workout. Your excuse, of course, is a good one. The majority of hotel gyms pretty much suck. There’s typically a pool, some scattered exercise equipment, and if you’re lucky, aerobics classes available…when you’re not. \nThat’s not very motivating, and because you really want to stay on track while you’re in town, we’ve gathered a good list of fitness studios certain to make you sweat. What’s particularly awesome is that many of these spots have deals for those visiting Chicago. From Pilates and yoga to a number of unique aerobics activities, here’s what we discovered.

That, right there is an incentive, but it certainly will not come easy. The Lincoln Park studio’s outfitted with 10 MegaFormer machines offering a combination of a moving platform, adjustable tensions, adjustable resistances, pivot bars and handle bars. Each machine is adjusted to the individual’s personal preferences and the workout is also customized for the optimal experience. Its original Hollywood studio boasts a number of celebrity clients who sweat it out on the MegaFormer when they’re getting ready for roles. Body R+D offers classes for groups, couples and individuals. 2940 N. Lincoln Ave., 773-935-3200 \n\nVisitor Fees: $10 for first-time drop in; $29 per class regularly More » Photo courtesy of ENRGi Fitness 2. ENRGi Fitness \nTrue to its name, ENRGi Fitness specializes in high-energy, high-impact group classes. The descriptions alone tempt you to want to drop in for a session instead of heading out to the usual booty-shaking bars. Chisel fo’ Shizzel may sound like an intro to Snoop Dogg, but it’s actually hardcore strength training that’s choreographed to contemporary beats. Students use free weights until muscles fatigue in this 30- or 45-minute class. The Spartan Workout pays homage to the strenuous workout routines actors from “300” endured to get that enviable, chiseled look. It’s only 30 minutes--so you know it’s insanely intense--and is 300 repetitions of resistance and plyometric exercises. ENRGi also offers cardio bootcamp classes, barre, rowing and yoga classes. 215 W. Ohio St., 312-846-6989 \n\nVisitor Fees: $20 drop in; $35 for weeklong unlimited pass for first-timers; $49 for three drop-ins for first timers; $45 for unlimited week pass; $160 for one month, no contract More » Photo courtesy of FitGirl Studio 3. FitGirl Studio \nWomen come to FitGirl Studio for Ballet Body Boot Camp because it’s the only place you’ll find it outside of Los Angeles. The hour-long workout builds endurance, improves flexibility and most certainly burns fat. Just so you know, no tutu is required; just bring your regular workout gear. You’ll need it also for classes like Barre, spin shred (with free weights), spin flow (with yoga), sculpt fusion yoga (with weights) and candlelight restorative yoga. 1642 Maple Ave., Evanston, 847-869-4475 \n\nVisitor Fees: $20 drop in; $20 for weeklong unlimited pass for first-timers More » Courtesy of Flywheel Chicago 4. Flywheel Gold Coast/Flywheel Old Town/FlyBarre \nSpin enthusiasts will find so many cool perks at the stylish Gold Coast and Old Town gyms, including the privilege of reserving a bike in advance. Flywheel offers stadium seating so that no student’s view of the instructor is obstructed. Contemporary music cranks in to energize students and the room flickers to dim so that students may concentrate on their rides. The 45- and 60-minute classes include light weight training as students continue to spin on their bikes. That’s pretty much unheard of. FlyBarre, a revolutionary form of body sculpting blending the best of yoga, dance, circuit training, Pilates and strength building, is only offered at the Old Town location. First-timers may ride for free if they create a “profile” on the website. The gyms provide complimentary spin shoes, towels, water and fruit. 710 N. State St., 312-624-8485 and 1653 N.
