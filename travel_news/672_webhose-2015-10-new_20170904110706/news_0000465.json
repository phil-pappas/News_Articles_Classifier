All passengers flying on Saturday, Oct. 17, will be flying on American. \nThe US Airways website will redirect to AA.com, and the US Airways mobile app will be disabled by Oct. 18. \nAmerican has prepared as if for battle. Staffing levels at airports have been increased by more than 20%. More than 350 additional IT technicians have been dispatched to airports, and 80 American airport agents will help out at US Airways hubs. \nAirport agents have been armed with 1,300 mobile devices with YADA – Your Assistant Delivered Anywhere – which allows them to check in customers, print bag tags, and board flights anywhere. \nThe carrier has conducted six full-scale tests with nearly 5 million mock reservations. \nTo ease the pressure, American reduced its flight schedule at US Airways’ three hubs – Phoenix, Charlotte and Philadelphia, by about 11%. \nBut perhaps the most significant step it has taken is the “drain-down” of flights that began about three months ago. \nAt that point, American filed a schedule change whereby all US Airways flights scheduled to operate on or after Oct. 17 were converted to American flights and moved to the Sabre system. \nBecause so many of American’s business travelers book close to departure, the vast majority of flights booked since the 90-day countdown began have been flown, leaving only about 10% of reservations to be migrated. \nBut when you are talking about technology, the best-laid plans can be afflicted with what the tech world like to call “glitches,” and passengers flying this weekend should be prepared to exercise patience if necessary. \nAgents can help by reminding them to read their e-mails sent by American that outline procedures for obtaining tier status upgrades and offer other helpful hints.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:24:35.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
