The addition of Ziegler-Instruments ' PEM material database gives Altair's SnRD clients access to the results for over 11,000 individual stick and slip phenomena for different materials pairs.\nThe SnRD is a combination of highly customized software and automated processes that are implemented by Altair's service division, Altair ProductDesign in conjunction with a client's engineering team and testing teams. The solution creates a comprehensive, efficient and semi-automated approach to determine relative component displacements in the time domain that can lead to undesired squeaking and rattling in products. By identifying potential areas of concern in the early stages of design, the overall design quality can be improved and significant cost and time savings can be realized.\nUniquely designed to be deeply integrated within a company's existing work environment and processes by the Altair ProductDesign team, the SnRD offers a comprehensive methodology to streamline the entire squeak and rattle simulation workflow process from model creation to results visualization.\nThe benefits of the update include:\nCreate squeak and rattle interfaces requiring less input and less interaction Easily manipulate interfaces after creation, using fields in Review Panel Visually inspect squeak and rattle interfaces and their respective data entry Understanding the root cause of issues Calculate modal sensitivity Provide active feedback \"The Squeak and Rattle Director allows us to input different data, like design and manufacturing tolerances, in order to improve the output of our analysis and therefore have more valuable inputs to the project,\" said Marcelo Starling Braga , NVH Coordinator, FIAT Brazil.\nThe SnRD is ideally suited to companies that serve markets where quality and value are tightly coupled with the perceptions of Squeak and Rattle. The SnRD also enables engineers to identify risk areas for squeak and rattle from the earliest development phase to correlation and test support, decreasing the time spent performing S&R analysis by up to 80%.\n\"We're very happy to be able to partner with Ziegler-Instruments and bring its hugely valuable PEM database to our clients,\" said Doron Helfman , Vice President of Enterprise Solutions, Altair. \"Squeak and rattle noise has such a huge effect on the perceived quality of a product so has become a real area of focus for engineering teams across industry. We are excited to enhance our solution and to work alongside more companies wanting to accurately predict and eliminate the problem.\"\nA global webinar will be hosted by Altair and Ziegler Instruments on Thursday, October 29 th at 10am ET ( 3pm GMT , and 4pm CET ), to further discuss the uses and benefits of the newly improved Squeak and Rattle Director, as well as the value of the Altair and Ziegler collaboration.
