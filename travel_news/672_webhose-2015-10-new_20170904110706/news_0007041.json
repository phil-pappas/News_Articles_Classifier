Kennedy was running for president.\n\"And they get that urge when they are just passing through.\"\nRoute 66, also called the Mother Road, began in 1926 after the Bureau of Public Roads launched the nation's first federal highway system, bringing together existing local and state roads from Chicago through St Louis to Los Angeles.\nSmall towns opened shops, motels and petrol stations to pump revenue into local economies just as the nation's car culture took off.\nIts importance even sparked a Route 66 song performed by Nat King Cole and later by the 1980s English electronic band Depeche Mode.\nYet the route changed a number of times through the years and eventually became less of a destination thanks to new interstate highways.\nIn 2008, the World Monuments Fund listed Route 66 on the \"Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites\".\nDespite its endangered status, Route 66 remains an attraction for tourists who seek out its neon-lit diners and vintage motels - like the now-defunct Albuquerque motel where Bill Gates lived while launching Microsoft.\nAlong the way, they can hunt through used bookstores for dusty copies of everything from John Steinbeck's Tortilla Flat to Ana Castillo's Peel My Love Like an Onion.\n\"I specialise in nonfiction,\" said 61-year-old Mert Glancy, who runs 5th Street Books.\nHer store is a block away from the storied road and is located in a building that once housed a newspaper office.\n\"There's another bookstore a block away that concentrates on contemporary fiction,\" she said.\nNo one knows just how many used bookstore are located along Route 66. The online bookstore, AbeBooks.com, recently listed 66 used bookstores near Route 66 and still faced angry comments for leaving off others.\nSome used bookstore owners don't even realise they're on the famous route.\nKeith Peterson, 64, owns Selected Works Used Books and Sheet Music, which is a block from the beginning of Route 66 in Chicago.\nHe admitted he didn't know Route 66 started at Chicago's Grant Park. His second-floor store is across the street.\n\"We get a lot of out-of-town tourists, especially during the blues festival,\" Peterson said.\n\"They usually want Hemingway or (Kurt) Vonnegut and we are always out. Those are hard to keep on the shelves.\"\nOther owners know exactly where they are because Route 66 memorabilia surrounds them.\nThat's the case for Scott Free, 46, a former engineer who opened Downtown Books in Albuquerque 15 years ago.\nHis store is a block south of the road and near Route 66 locations for scenes from the Breaking Bad TV series. Route 66 travellers were a big customer base, he said.\nDuring a recent afternoon, Marco Cremasco of Sao Paulo, Brazil, stumbled upon the store during a walk along Route 66 after an Amtrak train ride.\nThe 28-year-old had been travelling through the United States for three months.\n\"I had a big Route 66 sign in my room as a kid,\" he said while thumbing through books in the fiction section.\n\"I'm glad I found this place.\"\nHe sat down to read before continuing his trip to Santa Fe, then Los Angeles.\nBut what keeps attracting customers? It's the experience of trying to find a lost treasure or out-of-print book, said Eisner.\n\"And I think people love the smell of old books,\" she said. \"If I could bottle it, I'd sell it, too. On Route 66.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:21:48.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
