The group said the fine \"relates to the timing\" of the disconnection.\nLast week, MTN announced that its subscriber base in Nigeria marginally declined to 62.5-million for the three months to September. This was mainly as a result of the disconnection of 5.1-million subscribers at the end of August 2015 in line with industry-wide regulatory registration requirements. To date, 3.4-million of these subscribers have been reconnected.\nMTN said it was in discussions with the regulator to resolve the matter. “MTN Nigeria is currently in discussions with the NCC to resolve the matter in recognition of the circumstances that prevailed with regard to these subscribers,” the company said.\nTony Ojobo, the NCC’s director of public affairs said all other telecommunication firms operating in Nigeria complied with the directive except MTN. He said MTN, whose biggest market is Nigeria, had not denied the infraction and that its enforcement team deactivated the unregistered lines to ensure compliance.\n“We had a directive that was given to all the networks to deactivate all unregistered SIM card on their networks and they had enough time to do that,” Mr Ojobo said. “We came out with all guidelines and the fine was supposed to be 200,000 naira per SIM card,” he said,\nLast week the company reported a slowdown in quarterly subscriber growth and said performance continued to be impacted by ongoing regulatory restrictions\nThe company has, however, put \"corrective\" measures in place to address the operational challenges experienced in the first half of the year and has seen significant improvement in network quality together with more competitive offerings.\n“Whenever the Nigerian regulator steps up enforcement, MTN takes a hammering,” said Dobek Pater, a telecoms analyst at Africa Analysis based in Johannesburg, adding that Nigeria contributes around a third of MTN’s sales and is the company’s largest market.\nShares in MTN were down more than 10% after the fine was announced on Monday. By 2.28pm GMT, shares were down 14.25% at R166.99.\nWith Reuters", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=MTN"], "published": "2015-10-26T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:18:43.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
