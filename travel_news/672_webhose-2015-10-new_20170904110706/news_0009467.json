By 2020 that number will reach 337, Starbucks’ Regional Director for Central America David Batres said. He did not disclose the amount of investment or the locations of the 15 new shops, citing company policy. He did say some new locations could be outside of the Greater Metropolitan Area.\nBy the end of 2015 the company will have a total of five openings this year. The chain opened its first store here in 2012, and Batres said the company attributes its growth to good results among Tico customers.\nThe local franchise belongs to Premium Restaurants of America, a corporation that also manages Starbucks franchises in Mexico, Guatemala and Panama.\nIn addition to traditional blends customers here also can purchase Costa Rican coffee from Bella Vista, a farm in the Cartago canton of Tres Ríos.\nThe Seattle-based Starbucks Corp. also has a direct presence in Costa Rica as it owns a coffee farm next to Poás Volcano, in Alajuela province.\nAt the experimental farm researchers develop new coffee varieties through hybridization – which is not genetic modification – and different processing techniques that result in new flavored coffees, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said in 2013, when the company acquired the property.\nIn 2012, Starbucks introduced its most expensive coffee ever, Costa Rica Finca Palmilera , in a limited number of U.S. stores. The $7 cup is brewed from a coffee variety called Geisha found in various Central American countries. It is famously difficult to cultivate. The variety used for the expensive coffee is grown in Tarrazú, south of San José, by brothers Marvin and Didier Sánchez, who set aside just three hectares of their estate to grow Geisha coffee.\nIn addition to $7 cups, the Reserve Costa Rica Finca Palmilera Geisha varietal coffee is being sold at limited Clover Starbucks stores (in the Pacific Northwest), at $40 for a half-pound.\nContact L.
