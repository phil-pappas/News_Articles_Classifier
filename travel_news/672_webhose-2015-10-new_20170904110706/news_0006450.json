The price of Singapore kerosene-type jet fuel during the two month period of August and September 2015 averaged US$57.92 per barrel, which accounted for 7,054 yen in the average exchange rate of 121.80 JPY/USD during the same period. \nAs a result, with reference to the fuel surcharge benchmark list for FY2015 in Japanese yen, this corresponds to Zone B of fuel surcharges. From December 2015 to January 2016, it will range from 300 yen on a Japan - Korea ticket to 7,000 yen on a Japan - USA ticket per person per sector flown, on tickets for travel originating in Japan. \nFuel Surcharge for the period: December 1, 2015 ~ January 31, 2016 \nCurrent Level: Zone C (Applicable till November 30, 2015) New Level: Zone B (Applicable on/after December 1, 2015) Based on average price of fuel: JPY 8,665/barrel JPY 7,054/barrel Route (Per person per sector flown) For sales in Japan For travel originating in Japan Japan - Korea, Far East Russia JPY 500 JPY 300 Japan- China, Hong Kong, Taiwan JPY 2,500 JPY 1,500 Japan- Guam, Palau, Philippines, Vietnam JPY 3,000 JPY 2,000 Japan- Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand JPY 4,500 JPY 3,000 Japan- Hawaii, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia JPY 6,000 JPY 4,000 Japan- Canada, Europe, Middle East, Oceania, USA (excl.
