Her studio in High Wycombe abounds with vases and pots but pride of place goes to a ceramic candlestick decorated with lotus flowers and a Chinese dragon coiled around its neck. “I’ve kept it for 40 years. It was my first piece,” said the 67-year-old Malaysian-born ceramics artist. “My teacher told me to make something, so I made the dragon candlestick. The Chinese influence was strong when I started to learn about pottery in the 1970s.” “Traditional Chinese artists also observe nature and then return to their studios to work” Jessie Lee Made from a material virtually unknown in Europe until the 1500s, Chinese porcelain caused a sensation in 16th-century Europe and became popular among the wealthy. By the 18th century its reputation had spread. Chinese porcelain, especially the blue-and-white ware, changed people’s ideas of beauty and the enormous demand encouraged European potters to try to replicate artworks from the East. And Chinese ceramics continue to inspire artists today. “Chinese porcelain is extremely famous in the West, especially the wares made in Jingdezhen,” said Ms Lee, referring to the home of Chinese ceramics in Jiangxi province. “Almost the entire collection of Chinese porcelain in the British Museum was made in Jingdezhen. For British potters, Jingdezhen is the place.” When she visited the city in 2011 she said she was impressed to discover the ancient pottery making skills had not disappeared. She recalled seeing a man coil a pot by walking around the vessel. An example of the Chinese porcelain on display at the British Museum “The pot was nearly a metre tall (3.2ft) and too big for the wheel, so the man held a lump of clay and moved around at a certain pace so that it looked like he was dancing,” she said. “It was an old way of making pots and very beautiful. I was inspired and made a smaller coiled pot when I came home.” Last year, Ms Lee returned to Jingdezhen and this time cut clay with a stretched coil spring to produce shapes such as waves and ripples. “The local landscape inspired me. I could hear and see the streams day and night,” she said. “Traditional Chinese artists also observe nature and then return to their studios to work.” Sanbao Ceramic Art Institute, a private art centre in a suburb of Jingdezhen, receives more than 200 foreign artists a year, including about 100 as artists-in-residence. Many come from Britain, said Li Wenying, the institute’s manager. When Ms Li attended the International Ceramics Festival in July at Aberystwyth, the Chinese artwork and hand-made pottery tools she took along attracted huge interest. “During the three-day event my stand was crowded all the time. People were asking me about Jingdezhen and traditional Chinese skills,” she said. “In 2013 I was invited to give a speech on our institution and Jingdezhen’s ceramic arts at the festival. Next time I hope to bring more Chinese potters.” After Jingdezhen’s potters discovered the secret of making porcelain during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), the material became one of China’s earliest and most important global commodities and helped introduce Chinese culture, art and the city to the world. Even today, Jingdezhen is a byword for ceramics. “For ceramic artists, Jingdezhen is like a gold mine; there are so many things to learn\" Li Wenying, Sanbao Ceramic Art Institute Although the industry has modernised, with many old processes now performed by machines, the city’s ancient kilns and skills have been preserved. Built during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the 130ft-long Zhenyao kiln is still used to fire porcelain and is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world’s largest wood-burning kiln. In 2005, a blue-and-white jar fired in Huluyao, another kiln in Jingdezhen, during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) sold for £22 million at an auction in London. “For ceramic artists, Jingdezhen is like a gold mine; there are so many things to learn. An ordinary old man walking on the street might be a master of the wood-burning kiln,” Ms Li said, adding that in Britain ceramists focus on having good ideas but few understand glazes and related skills such as throwing, coiling and painting. Mia Sarosi, a ceramics artist in Oxfordshire, made a flat-bottomed bowl decorated with a dragon pattern for an exhibition at Art in Action, one of Britain’s largest annual art events, held at Waterperry Gardens. When she was making the work she constantly scrutinised the dragons seen on Chinese porcelain from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) because she was interested in the positive symbolism of the mythical beasts in both Eastern and Western cultures. “For the Art in Action show in July, I used gold lustre for the dragon’s flames. In China gold is a colour that’s used a lot in celebrations,” said the artist, who began working with ceramics in 1991. Although initially inspired by Chinese potters, British artists have developed their own styles. In the 18th century, when hand-painted blue and- white Chinese porcelain was fashionable and expensive, British potters created an affordable alternative by printing their designs onto earthenware. They also created the famous “willow pattern” motif by combining elements from several different Chinese patterns to produce a new design. In the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent, the home of English pottery, early imitations of Chinese porcelain are displayed alongside original works by Josiah Wedgwood, the innovative designer who improved Britain’s ceramics industry by incorporating new materials. Potter Dan Tyler in Stoke-on-Trent, the home of English pottery, examines the hardness of the clay Wedgwood’s Jasperware, made from white stoneware clay and coloured with metal oxides, was decorated with white relief portraits and scenes from Greek classics. “In the West, people focus more on innovation than craftsmanship,” said Christine-Ann Richards, 70, a ceramics artist in Somerset who believed British potters were eager to produce original work. In 1978, she was part of the first group of British ceramic artists to visit China. She said the trip had a radical effect on her work. Some of her monochrome porcelain, such as white plates with spontaneous brush strokes in black, was inspired by Chinese calligraphy, which she has loved since her trip to China. “But I never copy anything. I’m very much a maker,” she said. Ms Lee in High Wycombe echoed this sentiment: “I don’t borrow ideas from Chinese ceramics. The philosophy behind the work is the thing I’m most eager to learn.” • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:42:25.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
