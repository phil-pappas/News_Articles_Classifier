A fair bit. This year I’ve travelled abroad twice to film on location. First, to southern Morocco to shoot the TV miniseries AD The Bible Continues. Second, to Lithuania to shoot a new BBC adaptation of War and Peace. I also found time to visit Chicago with my family – I’d never been there and it blew me away. What do you need for your perfect holiday? A city, because there’s always something interesting to see or do. For example, when I visited Chicago, my wife and I checked out the old library and, quite by chance, discovered that there was a free classical concert about to start. The Chicago skyline Photo: Getty Images Where did you go on holiday as a child? I was born in Scotland and lived there for a couple of years before moving to England with my family. But we’d always go back there for holidays when I was a child to visit my grandparents, usually to Lochgelly, Fife. The town is famous in Scotland because it’s where they used to make the leather straps they beat kids at school with! • 31 reasons why we love Scotland Earliest memory of travelling abroad? In 1947, I visited Brussels with my parents on their first trip abroad, although I was too young to remember anything about it. Then they took to going camping in France and I remember our very English little green tent, which seemed very basic alongside the Continental campers’ navy blue masterpieces. Are you an adventurous traveller? One of my most adventurous holidays was just a few years ago with my great pal, the late actor Roger Lloyd Pack. We went to Iceland together, looking for the Northern Lights – but ended up in a sideways blizzard. Luckily, we bumped into a local who recognised Roger and led us to safety. It was a wonderful holiday, even if we never did get to see the fabled Lights. The Northern Lights in Iceland Photo: Getty Images The most remote place you’ve ever been? Last year I took my family to Iona, in the Hebrides, which is pretty remote for the UK – as are the Orkneys, another part of the country I love. Your most luxurious travel experience? Flying first class to New Zealand to make a TV miniseries some years ago. That was quite something – I’d never travelled first class before. Oh, the luxury! And the choice of food on the menu was fantastic. South Island, New Zealand Photo: Getty Images Favourite hotel? Probably Mount Nelson, in Cape Town . There’s something really magical about the place. They’ve got menus on the wall from the old Cunard crossings, Table Mountain is right in front of you – and the staff smile so much that I got tired muscles from smiling back at them. Favourite city? I had the great fortune to appear in the 2008 film Valkyrie, which we shot in Berlin – and I was amazed by how much the city had changed since I visited it in the Sixties when it was divided, and the atmosphere in East Berlin was so awful. Worst travel experience? Flying is getting ridiculous at the big airports – you can’t find the departure gates for the shopping malls! And it’s not just the planes. I took my wife to Vienna by train this year – there was an escaped prisoner on the loose near Cologne and all the trains got held up. The Mount Nelson hotel in Cape Town Photo: Alamy You’ve spent a lot of time touring – do you enjoy the lifestyle? No, I think touring is the most unhealthy form of life that’s ever existed. Tour companies rarely pay you enough to stay in hotels, so you end up staying in b&bs. Best travel tip? Be careful what you drink in some countries. I remember having a glass of water and ice in Bali and getting very bad dysentery. And don’t bother taking your tea bags with you. I’ve seen Brits in Spain asking cafés if they “do tea” – and it’s just not worth it. What are you going to get? A glass of lukewarm water with a tea bag in it, and it’s going to be dreadful. Your travel essential? A photo of Harry, my black cocker spaniel. Where next? I’ve always wanted to visit Shetland. Not so long ago, I got a script to appear in a TV drama being shot there – but it was rubbish, so I didn’t go in the end. But that’s definitely next on my to-visit list – it’s a tick that has to be ticked. The Father, starring Kenneth Cranham, is on at Wyndham’s Theatre in London until November 21.
