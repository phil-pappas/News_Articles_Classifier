I have a home in East Hampton where I spend summers with my 12-year-old son Lorcan, writing and entertaining friends. It’s paradise. Southampton, the oldest English settlement in New York, is where American high society such as the Vanderbilts had homes and it’s full of billionaires’ mansions. Bridgehampton is sophisticated, with great restaurants. I’m practically next door to artist Jackson Pollock’s old house, which is now a museum (001 631 324 4929; sb.cc.stonybrook.edu ). I have a dock on the bay, so the view is stunning. • The Hamptons: open to anyone A street in East Hampton, New York Photo: Alamy Anything special I should pack? Comfy towels to lay on the miles of beautiful sandy beaches, a lot of swimsuits and a couple of classy outfits for going out in the evening. What do you miss most when away? The peace and watching the exquisite birds, deer and wild turkeys. Where’s the best place to stay? The American Hotel in Sag Harbor (001 631 725 3535; theamericanhotel.com ) dates back to the mid-19th century and is full of character. Two great examples of historic b&bs – both in Southampton – are 1708 House (001 631 287 1708; 1708house.com ), which is full of old-world charm, and A Butler’s Manor (001 631 283 8550; abutlersmanor.com ) , a former colonial home run by a British ex-butler. • Hot property: the Hamptons The American Hotel in the Hamptons Photo: Alamy Where would you meet friends for a drink? Friends know they’ll never winkle me out at lunchtime to drink because I’m writing from about 5am until around 2pm. People tend to brunch rather than have a drink at lunchtime, because they have dinner so early. There are some great cafés and bakeries serving luxury home-made sandwiches and cakes, such as The Golden Pear Café in Southampton (001 631 283 8900; goldenpearcafe.com ) . Where would you go for lunch? The best place for lunch in Southampton is Silver’s (001 631 283 6443; silversrestaurant.com ), which has been around since the Twenties. You must try the clam chowder there. Photo: Alamy And for dinner? La Parmigiana (001 631 283 8030; 44-48 NY-27A), a great family-run Sicilian restaurant in Southampton – their home-made pizzas are a speciality. Another favourite is Nick and Toni’s (001 631 324 3550; nickandtonis.com ) in East Hampton, where you’ll spot celebrities such as Billy Joel and Steven Spielberg. Movie stars love it there. The food is great: seafood, steaks, fresh pasta. People literally fight and wait months to get a table. I’m also a fan of The Lobster Roll (631 369 3030; lobsterroll.com ), which is cheap and does the best fish and chips I’ve ever had. • The best new Hamptons restaurants Where would you send a first -time visitor? The Dock House (001 631 725 7555; dockhouseny.com ) in glorious Sag Harbour for its seafood and views. Then shopping in Southampton and East Hampton, which offer a great mix of designer shops and little boutiques. A favourite clothes shop is Calypso St Barth in Southampton (001 631 283 4321; calypsostbarth.com ), which is very expensive. I’ll often go to TJ Maxx in Bridgehampton (001 631 537 1591; tjmaxx.tjx.com ) . A must-see is Southampton Historical Museum (001 631 283 2494; southamptonhistoricalmuseum.org ) for its great collection of buildings and memorabilia. Photo: Alamy What should I bring home? A new outfit. There’s so much choice and you see things you haven’t seen anywhere else. I’m desperately trying to curb my shopping habits but I do love to pick up a beautiful white trouser suit or a dress for the evening. • Great Gatsby-style houses in the Hamptons What should I avoid? The surfers in Montauk during peak season. It’s sad that the teenage binge-drinkers there are making the area quite unpleasant. Public transport or taxi? They have this unique form of transport in The Hamptons called the Jitney (001 631 283 4600; hamptonjitney.com ), which is a posh bus that goes in and out of Manhattan. And it’s very cheap. I’d never take a taxi. The Jitney Photo: Alamy Handbag or money belt? Just my handbag under my arm. The place is so safe. Anywhere that isn’t your kind of town? Val d’Isère. I went last winter for the first time and it will be my last. I was trapped in the airport for 48 hours because of a so-called avalanche. It’s full of boutique hotels with black walls and red ceilings. The rooms were all so dark and I couldn’t find anything.
