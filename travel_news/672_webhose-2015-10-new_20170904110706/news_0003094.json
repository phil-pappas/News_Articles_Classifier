Chinese men are more at risk of dying from smoking-related illnesses, according to an alarming new report.\nSmoking is currently responsible for a million deaths in China every year, but that number could rise to 3 million, or one in three among all Chinese men who die annually, by 2050, without a sustained effort to persuade smokers to quit, according to the report published in medial journal the Lancet.\n“China is at the epicenter of the global tobacco epidemic,” the report states.\nThe report is based on research that was started in the 1990s involving a quarter of a million men across the country. It was followed 15 years later by a broader study involving half a million men and women.\nNearly seven of every 10 Chinese men currently smoke cigarettes, with most starting before they turn 20. The report found that 68% of Chinese men currently smoke cigarettes, with most starting before they turn 20. In contrast, just 3.2% of Chinese women smoke, although that won’t let them off the hook, either.\n“While men are at substantial risk of death and disease from active smoking, women are at risk from passive exposure at home and in the workplace,” said the report.\nChina is the world’s biggest grower, manufacturer and consumer of tobacco. The industry accounts for more than 7% of the government’s annual tax revenue and net income. Cigarettes are still relatively affordable, and there is widespread ignorance about their health risks.\nBut that’s not all. There are many myths about smoking in China, such as that Asians are biologically immune to the smoking hazards that hurt people in the West, or that tobacco use is an essential part of ancient Chinese culture.\nFemale smokers are generally older, part of a generation that were specifically targeted by companies including the American Tobacco Co., which encouraged them to smoke as a symbol of emancipation, marketing cigarettes as “torches of freedom,” according to the report. For younger women, smoking was not socially acceptable, although the rate of experimentation among teenage girls is growing.\nChanging minds won't be easy. The report found that fewer than 10% of Chinese smokers quit by choice, as opposed to kicking the habit because of illness, compared with about 50% of smokers in developed countries. “Widespread smoking cessation offers China one of the most effective, and cost-effective, strategies to avoid disability and premature death over the next few decades,” the report concludes.\nThe World Health Organization says the most effective way to curb tobacco use is through a combination of public health campaigns, high taxation of tobacco products and bans on smoking in public places. Nearly 80% of the more than 1 billion people worldwide who smoke live in low- and middle-income countries, where those measures are the least prevalent, while the burden of early death is heaviest.\nTobacco kills about 6 million every year, about 600,000 of whom die from the effects of secondhand smoke.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2900416-X/fulltext?rss=yes"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:00:20.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
