German automotive industry has reliably extended its worldwide position. It assembled 5.65 million new autos in 2014 an increment of 4% from 2013. Increasing number of car parts, such as engine blocks and structural parts, are being manufactured from magnesium using high-pressure die-casting.\nMagic Precision Inc., Meridian Lightweight Technologies, MK Group of Companies, Morimura Bros Inc., Ryobi Die Casting Inc., Gibbs Die Casting Group and Georg Fischer Limited are some of the key players in the market.Availability of the raw materials in a large variety of semi-furnished forms, such as shape, castings, extrusions and sheet has become a major advantage to the die cast manufacturers. Such semis are very suitable for mass production and innovative solutions in the form of compact and highly integrated parts that meet the high demands for performance, quality and cost efficient manufacturability. Evolution of magnesium as engine block material by BMW, gaining acceptance of aluminum castings for many parts and innovative applications in the construction of space frame, axle parts and structural components are some of the major factors driving the Europe automotive parts die casting market in this region.\nGermany die casting industry had a strong emphasis on the application of scientific knowledge and the best way to perform the process. With this emphasis, the German die casters developed an integrated approach resulting in high quality, low cost components, which are very much needed by the automotive industry. Upgraded research & development, knowledgeable workforce, abundant metal supply, supportive infrastructure, competitive energy costs, middle range labor costs, sophisticated political and legal systems aiding in investment and high usage of automotive standards and the UL systems are some of the major drivers propelling the market for magnesium die casting as a whole, in Germany .\nThe market is segmented based on the production process type, by application type and by geography type. In a nutshell, automobile makers are now focusing on collaborating with the part die casting manufacturers in order to produce fuel-efficient and lightweight automobiles.\nOur Report Offerings\nThis report on Germanyautomotive parts magnesiumdie casting market, analyzes the current market trends in Germany , in detail.\nThis report offers the technical aspects and economic data of the market and its forecast to the next 5 years (2015-2020).\nIt also discusses the latest technologies in the Germanyautomotive magnesiumdie castingalloys and parts that are under development and in research pipeline.\nThis report provides the list of major players in the market and gives an in depth analyst perspective of what makes the products and strategies of these players stand out.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3320467/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/germany-automotive-parts-magnesium-die-casting-market---growth-trends-forecast-2015-2020-300165027.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
