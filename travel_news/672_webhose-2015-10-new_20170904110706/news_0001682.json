As scores of architectural landmarks open their doors to visitors, there should be even more interest in trekking out to JFK: This may be the last chance to go inside the TWA Flight Center before its transformation into a swanky hotel begins; it won't reopen again until late 2018.\nIn fact, due to the uncertainty over the development plans, the TWA terminal does not appear in the official printed guide for the event, said OHNY executive director Gregory Wessner, who added that he was “thrilled” when he got late word that the building would be back on the program for the fifth time. He added that it’s a popular fixture on the OHNY itinerary—it drew about 3,000 visitors last year—which includes hundreds of points of interest around the five boroughs.\nOHNY board member Dee Dunn, co-founder of the event’s partner app Dsgnfix , said the TWA open house typically draws a throng of aviation enthusiasts and former airline employees in addition to the usual architecture buffs. “Some come dressed in mid-century airline uniforms,” she said. “Lots of former TWA employees come and bring their families; some of them are crying. It’s really an emotional experience.” Built in 1962, the building was last used as a passenger terminal in late 2001, when it was shuttered after the then-bankrupt TWA was sold to American. Despite its prominence, the space couldn’t be adapted to the demands of modern air travel and the building has remained mothballed since.\nBeginning October 6 and through the OHNY Weekend, the app will list all of the sites that are open to the general public, with information about location and visiting times. The terminal will be open from 11 a.m. to 3 pm. that Sunday.\nMore from Condé Nast Traveler:\nThe 2015 Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities Around the World\n100 Top Hotels & Resorts in the World\n50 Things to Do in the U.S. Before You Die\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-09-25/new-luxury-hotel-cleared-for-takeoff-at-jfk-twa-terminal?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-10-20/top-100-hotels-and-resorts-in-the-world-rca-2014?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.ohny.org/?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-06-27/things-to-do-in-america-all-50-us-states?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-08-14/the-2015-friendliest-and-unfriendliest-cities-in-the-world?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/?mbid=synd_msn", "http://www.dsgnfix.com/?mbid=synd_msntravel#search-discover-share"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:11:27.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
