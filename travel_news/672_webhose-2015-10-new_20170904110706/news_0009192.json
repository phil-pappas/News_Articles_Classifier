Gentle trade winds waft through the colonial style buildings and lush manicured gardens. Each room offers breathtaking ocean views and all 92 units have patios or balconies that take advantage of ocean breezes. Guests can indulge in a variety of leisurely activities including snorkeling and diving or take a short stroll to nearby restaurants, nightlife and shops. \nOne of Green Globe’s longest term certified members, Southern Palms Beach Club & Resort Hotel, was recently recertified for the sixth consecutive year. The hotel’s management and staff achieved a notable score of 83% against accredited criteria. \nBritta Pollard, Managing Director at Southern Palms Beach Club & Resort Hotel said, “The team at Southern Palms are thrilled to renew our certification by Green Globe and it is the goal of the hotel to identify, monitor and improve all aspects of environmental sustainability on an ongoing basis.” \nProtecting biodiversity is a major consideration for Southern Palms as the beach is an active nesting ground for the Hawksbill Turtle. These turtles are now considered a critically endangered species. Turtle nesting and hatchings occur between May and October each year. But baby turtles can sometimes be seen emerging out of the sand as late as December. \nSouthern Palms adheres to a detailed Sustainability Management Plan to reduce the property’s impact on the environment. Energy consumption is monitored on a monthly basis and a 3% reduction in overall usage was achieved. A preventative maintenance policy is in place where faulty electrical equipment is reported resulting in significant power and cost savings. Water usage is also measured monthly and a 3% reduction target has been set. In addition, a waste volume reduction target has also been set at 3%. \nSouthern Palms prefers products purchased from local businesses to support economic development. In addition, the hotel actively supports its community by sponsoring cultural events such as the Oistins Fish Festival 2015 that celebrated local fisherfolk and commemorated the Signing of the Charter of Oistins, a significant event in the colonial history of Barbados. \nAbout Green Globe Certification \nGreen Globe is the worldwide sustainability system based on internationally accepted criteria for sustainable operation and management of travel and tourism businesses.
