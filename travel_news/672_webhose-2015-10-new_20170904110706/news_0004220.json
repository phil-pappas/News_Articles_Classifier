Using soda cans filled to various levels with water, Slobodien demonstrated how you can balance a can on its edge by finding its center of gravity. He also showed how to balance a plate on a stick with the same center-of-gravity trick and explained that the same basic principles are used by a tightrope walker.\nUsing soda cans filled to various levels with water, nuclear physicist Michael Slobodien, grandfather of Natan Slobodien Rodriguez, demonstrates how you can balance a can on its edge by finding the center of gravity. Avi Weiss is mesmerized by seeing soda cans standing on edge like magic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:41:49.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
