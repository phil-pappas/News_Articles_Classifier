It’s not as if one ingredient is particularly Japanese. But this pie has shown up at family reunions and the monthly church potluck for what seems like forever.\nIt’s decidedly Southern and a twist on a pecan pie with fruit thrown in. Not that a pecan pie needs improving, but this is an interesting switch-up. In digging through my mom’s and grandmother’s recipe files, I found several copies of the same pie with few changes. But there is one variation that I love: Lemon juice and zest are substitutes for the distilled vinegar. Fresh lemon and lemon zest always make things taste brighter and better. Suddenly this predictable pie is elevated to favorite status.\nJAPANESE FRUIT PIE\n2\nlarge eggs, beaten well\n1\ncup sugar\n1\nstick butter, melted and cooled\n1/2\ncup shredded coconut (see Cook’s Note)\n1/2\ncup raisins\n1/2\ncup chopped pecans or walnuts\n1\ntablespoon fresh lemon juice\n1\nteaspoon fresh lemon zest\n1\n(9-inch) unbaked pie shell\nPreheat oven to 350 F. In a large bowl, stir together the eggs, sugar, butter, coconut, raisins, nuts, lemon juice and zest. Pour into the pie shell. Bake for about 35 minutes or until golden brown on top and center is set. Cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Makes 8 servings.\n(Cook’s Note: Any type of coconut works. The recipe analysis is for a serving with shredded unsweetened coconut.)\nPER SERVING: Calories 319 (56% from fat), Fat 20 g (10 g sat), Cholesterol 77 mg, Sodium 118 mg, Fiber 1 g, Carbohydrates 35 g, Protein 4 g", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:50:56.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
