Earlier this week BESydney announced the Cathay Life Taiwan Summit has been secured for 2016, a great example of how the City’s current investment is helping to pay dividends for local businesses into the future. \n\n\"We are happy to work with Business Events Sydney to secure more events, which will help off-set potential economic impacts of the central business district light rail works and the Darling Harbour redevelopment.” \n\nOn October 12, BESydney announced that up to A$113 million of corporate incentive events have been secured for 2016 and 2017 including Nu Skin Greater China Success Trip 2016, Cathay Life Taiwan Summit 2016 and Amway China Leadership Seminar 2017, with broad support from Destination New South Wales (NSW) and the City of Sydney. \n\nTo date, BESydney has injected up to A$249 million into the NSW economy by securing more than 53,000 Asian incentive delegates over the past three years alone. This represents 20 per cent year-on-year growth from this sector, which has contributed to BESydney’s strong result. \n\nSome 146 events previously secured by BESydney, estimated to be worth A$404 million in direct expenditure to NSW, will take place between January 2015 to December 2023.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:03:43.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
