I thank the United States Trade Representative and fellow trade negotiators for their commitment to finalizing this agreement. U.S. companies need to be able to compete and win in global markets to support well-paying jobs at home. It's critical we provide our manufacturers and exporters with the best tools to compete on a level-playing field in markets worldwide.\n\"More than 70 percent of Boeing's commercial airplane revenue last year came from customers outside the United States , while more than 90 percent of our total workforce and 80 percent of our suppliers are based here in the United States. Looking ahead, the global economy will be more important than ever to our future growth.\"\nContact:\nTim Neale\nBoeing Communications\n+1 703-465-3220\ntim.d.neale@boeing.com\nKate Bernard\nBoeing Communications\n+1 703-229-9398\nkathryn.b.bernard@boeing.com\n releases/boeing-ceo-comment-on-pacific-trade-agreement-progress-300154135.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boeing-ceo-comment-on-pacific-trade-agreement-progress-300154135.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG19936&Transmission_Id=201510051218PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG19936&DateId=20151005"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:27:40.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
