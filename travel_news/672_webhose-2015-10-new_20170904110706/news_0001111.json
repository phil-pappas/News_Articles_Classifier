Not a huge sum, you might think, but it soon adds up. In a week that figure swells to 70p and in a year it’s £36. Per bulb. LEAVING ITEMS ON STANDBY Each TV or computer on standby quietly costs you about 2p per hour. Completely switching off electrical appliances could save the average home around £30 per year. If everyone in the UK remembered to do it, we would save the country nearly £800m and enough carbon dioxide to fill Wembley Stadium 350 times. FORGETTING TO UPGRADE Energy-efficient products really do save money in the long run. Replacing a G-rated boiler with an A-rated boiler saves about £340 per year. An A+++ rated fridge freezer would save nearly £200 compared with an A+ product over its lifetime. THERMOSTAT LEFT TOO HIGH Turning the central heating down by just one degree could save about £90 per year. Many people turn it higher to warm a room more quickly, but thermostats do not work like that: they warm at the same rate to a higher temperature. What you really want is better timing. Installing a full set of modern heating controls could save between £80 and £165 per year. FORGETTING TO INSULATE The recommended depth of loft insulation is now 27cm. If you don’t have this installed, it could be costing you £140 per year. If your house doesn’t have cavity walls, neglecting to install interior or exterior insulation could be costing you £260 a year. Even apparently small things such as a jacket for a hot-water cylinder could save up to £140 annually. • Learn about smart meters and find out how you can save money and time to spend on the things you love.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:44:09.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
