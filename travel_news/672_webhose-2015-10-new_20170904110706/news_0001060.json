She is privately owned and chartered for river cruises by UK-based niche operators, including Saga. It was my third cruise on this unique vessel. All you need to know about river cruises Style/character 8/10 More hotel barge than cruise ship, Anacoluthe has an intimate country-house charm – even the captain sometimes washes glasses behind the bar. Her decor puts the emphasis on civilised comfort, with big sofas, easy chairs, books, puzzles, board games and fresh flowers in the lounge bar, library and sun room. The open-seating dining room is light and bright. Public rooms have large windows. Anacoluthe is small enough to cruise south of Paris (some itineraries also go north) and explore upper reaches of the Seine and some of its less-travelled tributaries, revealing gems that other cruises cannot reach. Itineraries focus on French history, culture and art, supported by in-depth on-board lectures. All voyages include a Paris-by-night cruise. Facilities 7/10 Anacoluthe has three decks and no lift. Her roomy sun deck offers a range of seating and an exercise bike. Another exercise bike and a hot tub can be found outside on the main deck at the bow. Bicycles are available for passengers to use ashore. Cabins 6/10 All the cabins are on the lowest deck and are accessed by steep stairs. They are comfortable and compact at 113 sq ft, and have simple design and decor. All feature a small window, twin beds, bedside table, bookshelf, full-length mirror, ample storage space in a wardrobe and under-bed drawers, and an en-suite bathroom with walk-in shower. Anacoluthe's restaurant places its focus on French cuisine Food and drink 9/10 Award-winning fine food is Anacoluthe’s speciality – one that more than makes up for her basic accommodation. Menus focus on French cuisine, and the inclusion with lunch and dinner of carefully selected French wines (none of which is served twice during the course of a cruise), plus three different French regional cheeses at dinner (again with no repeats), is a feature of every cruise. All meals are prepared using fresh ingredients. Lunch is a hot dish accompanied by three salads –different every day – followed by dessert. Dinners run to four courses. Excursions 9/10 Although some local guides are used, most shore excursions are led by the on-board guide, and enriched by their knowledgeable insight. For most the same coach and driver are used, although some are walking tours. The unhurried pace usually allows some free time. All excursions were accompanied by a Saga escort. Value for money 9/10 Meals, and the drinks served with them, as well as excursions and on-board lectures, are included in the cruise fare. Tips and drinks at the bar incur extra charges. Wi-Fi is complimentary in public rooms, but reception can be patchy. Anacoluthe is sailing six- and seven-night cruises for Saga on the Seine from April to October 2016. From £1,299pp including return Eurostar travel and transfers (0800 300400; saga.co.uk/rivers ).
