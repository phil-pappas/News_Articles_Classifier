Ukraine has made its decision [on banning flights by Russian airlines] but has not held consultations. That is why, the first thing we are proposing is that we should hold consultations,\" he said. \nThe Russian aviation authorities are ready to hold consultations at any time and in any place, if the Ukrainian side responds to the proposal, Okulov said. \n\"There are shifts in this matter and it is becoming warmer because it is completely wrong to disrupt air communication,\" the Russian deputy transport minister said. \nRosaviatsia said on Monday Ukrainian airlines had turned for permission to fly in the 2015/2016 winter navigation period. \nSpecifically, Atlasjet Ukraine airline has requested to open air navigation for flights along the Kiev-Moscow, Odessa-Moscow, and Kiev-St. Petersburg routes while UTair Ukraine has asked permission for flights between Kiev and Moscow, Lviv and Moscow. \nIn turn, Rosaviatsia has proposed to Ukraine’s State Aviation Service to immediately hold negotiations in any place suitable for the Ukrainian side. \nEarlier, about 20 Russian airlines were included in the Ukrainian authorities’ sanctions lists, which will come into force on October 25. \nKiev’s blacklist includes Russia’s largest airline Aeroflot, which flies to Kiev, Kharkiv and Odessa, and also its three subsidiaries - Rossiya, Donavia and Orenburg Airlines. \nThe same blacklist includes Russia’s once second largest airline Transaero, which has come under Aeroflot’s operational control. Transaero flies to Kiev and Odessa. \nThe Ukrainian aviation authorities’ blacklist also includes Siberia Airline (S7), the third largest air carrier in Russia, and Urals Airlines. Russia’s UTair is the sole airline not included in Ukraine’s sanctions. \nIn response, Russia’s Rosaviatsia has notified the Ukrainian authorities of introducing a ban on the flights to Russia from October 25. \nUkraine’s largest air company, International Airlines of Ukraine, as well as Motor Sich airline have confirmed they have received the notification. The document was also sent to the Ukrainian YanAir airline.
