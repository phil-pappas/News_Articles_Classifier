Unfortunately, that figure will remain out of reach unless the many smaller firms in the UK embrace exporting. The trouble is, the UK’s smaller businesses are too often being held back by a shortage of export “know-how” and a perception that the rewards of selling abroad will not justify the effort. For Lara Morgan, that outlook is something that needs to change. Morgan started her first business at 23, selling brand-licensed toiletries to the global hospitality industry. After selling up in 2008 for £20m, she has started a number of businesses, including Companyshortcuts. com, the advisory site. Here, she answers some of the questions asked most frequently by potential exporters. As a small business, some of the tax you pay goes towards the cost of running UKTI, so why would you not use it? You’d be surprised how many don’t. Lara Morgan started her first business, Pacific Direct, at the age of 23. The company made and distributed brand-licensed toiletries and amenities to the hotel industry in markets all over the world. Seventeen years later, in 2008, she sold her majority share for £20m. Since selling Pacific Direct she has launched Company Shortcuts, an online platform for entrepreneurs who want to increase their effectiveness and accelerate their growth. She is a founder member of the Young Entrepreneurs’ Organisation and has been a finalist three times in the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards. Question: I run a small business consultancy. I’m keen to explore overseas opportunities, but being a service company I’m not sure that my ‘‘product’’ can be exported. Can it? Answer: Almost anything can be exported, including consultancy services. And in fact many of the businesses that have exported their services have found they have a higher perceived value in overseas markets, which means they are able to charge more. There is absolutely nothing to stop you from staying up one night to make, say, 50 or 60 calls to the US, doing some solid groundwork and calling competitors and potential consumers. The bonus is that, being a British company, you have an accent to which people will sit up and listen. Another thing in your favour is that a service business doesn’t need a lot of setting up before you start pursuing overseas customers. I can carry all my consulting know-how in my brain, and I find it travels very well. You should also take advantage of the considerable support resources that are available, including ambassadorial offices and UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), which can offer plenty of export help and advice (such as the Passport to Export scheme). As a small business, some of the tax you pay goes towards the cost of running UKTI, so why would you not use it? You’d be surprised how many don’t. Question: We have had a few inquiries from overseas for our products, but nowhere near our domestic levels of interest. Is it worth the time and hassle of following them up? Answer: It really isn’t difficult to find out whether your product is sellable in an international market. Speak to a freight company. They will be able to tell you about any duties and import restrictions that apply in your target country. Another tip is to approach one of the UK business schools and engage one of their students in a project. For example, we used Judge Business School at Cambridge to find out whether Germany is a good market for GATE8 luggage. In terms of following up inquiries from potential overseas clients, you should establish a system, using a questionnaire template, to identify the credibility of businesses that are reaching out to you and filter out the ones that will be a waste of your time. The kind of questions you include should relate to the kind of companies you are looking to do business with. There are similar considerations for establishing credibility for UK opportunities, and many of the same rules apply overseas. So you might want to ask how long they have been established as a business, how many sales people they employ, how many brands they represent, and so on. The credible ones will provide you with the information you need. As for the rest, you’ll probably never hear from them again. Question: We are a small business, producing handmade goods. We know there are multiple overseas markets for our products, especially in the US, but how do we generate interest in them? Answer: You need to visit trade fairs. If you have a product that is selling well in the UK it’s not rocket science to think that it could sell in the US, but you have to get out there and see for yourself. Remember that British law, irrespective of the contract, does not have power once your money is overseas, but serious customers will pay by pro-forma. You need not risk finance. Think hard about whether you want agents or distributors, or to register your own company abroad. Each has value implications. I’m the director of several companies and I do all the trade shows myself. It means spending three or four long days on your feet, from nine until six, promoting and energetically selling your product, finding out who likes it and how much they will pay for it, and studying the competition. The internet has made research so much faster and easier, and when you consider that you can travel to 27 European countries for less than it costs to travel the length of the UK, visiting trade fairs overseas is well within the means of most small businesses. • To find out how Export Finance can help you to trade internationally with confidence, visit www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:48:34.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
