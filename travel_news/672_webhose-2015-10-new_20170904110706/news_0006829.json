Taglined as the greatest show on snow, Snowbombing will take over the après stage to give snow-sports enthusiasts a taster of its massive music event held every year in Mayrhofen , Austria. On November 5, British indie-electronica band Hot Chip will be the main act when they take to the decks for a DJ set. Among all the party tunes needed to set the place off, Hot Chip are likely to showcase material from their latest album Why Make Sense? , which includes tracks such as Huarache Lights , Need You Now and Started Now . Expect a lot of bass and synth to go along with the wintery backdrop of the show when the London group hit the stage. Also on the bill is The 2 Bears, comprised of Hot Chip’s Joe Goddard and producer Raf Rundell. The duo mix a variety of genres such as 2-step, house, hip-hop and soul, and also host a show on Ministry of Sound Radio called Follow the Bears. On the Friday night, highly respected DJ Norman Jay MBE will bring his wide range of club material to the Battersea crowd. Jay can’t be pinned down to one genre, so the audience should expect the unexpected. After being acknowledged by the highest authority in the land (erm, the Queen), Jay is one of the main highlights on the music stage this year. Opening for Norman Jay are The Cuban Brothers, a quirky quartet who've built up a reputation on the international circuit with a distinctive blend of soulful music with jaw-dropping b-boy action and riotous comedy. They’ll be encouraging show-goers to laugh, dance and groove to the Cuban rhythms.
