The Trump Hotel Collection operates 10 luxury hotels in major cities including New York, Chicago, Washington, and Miami, and has four more slated to open in 2016, including Vancouver, Rio de Janeiro, and Baku, Azerbaijan. \nAt the time of Danziger’s hire, Ms. Trump told the Wall Street Journal that the company was in talks to add many locations, and close to closing deals in about 10. Her father, Donald Trump, is the leading Republican candidate for President of the United States. --Harvey Chipkin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:05:25.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
