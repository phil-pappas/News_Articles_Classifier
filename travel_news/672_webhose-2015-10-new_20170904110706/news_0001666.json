He launched \"The Cooper Manning Hour\" (Minus 58 minutes) with Fox Sports in which he has interviewed various NFL players from Odell Beckham Jr. to Von Miller to Cam Newton .\nArchie Manning, left, poses with his sons, Peyton , Cooper and Eli as they arrive at the Barnstable Brown Derby party in Louisville, Ky., in this Friday, May 4, 2007, file photo. ( Darron Cummings, The Associated Press ) There's no doubt to Peyton that Cooper is the funniest Manning of the family.\n\"Yeah, absolutely. Always has been. He's always had that quick wit and humor. He's getting a chance to do it. I know he's enjoying it. I know he's enjoying doing it, which I'm happy for him for that,\" Peyton said.\nMuch of Cooper's skits play with his natural, raw humor, but he doesn't hesitate to use Peyton to further his efforts.\nIt isn't the first time, either. When Peyton was the king of Knoxville in college at Tennessee, Cooper often went out to bars and other public spots using his similar looks to his younger brother to his advantage.\n\"Sometimes when people would mistake us, they would think he was me, and he wouldn't correct them,\" Peyton said. \"He'd use it a little bit. Yeah, out and about. Why not, you know?\"\nAdvertisement I guess we'd all use that to our advantage, right?\nCHEW ON THIS • The Broncos' offensive problems go beyond Peyton Manning .\n• Dozens upon dozens asked the question: Should Brock Osweiler replace Peyton Manning as the team's starting QB?
