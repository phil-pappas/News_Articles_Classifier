Joe thought that was unacceptable. \n“So we would have to pay money, over $US500 ($685), to buy back the points we had already earned,” Joe said. “Which to me was just ridiculous.” \nRunning out of options, the Woerners turned to New York’s PIX11 television station for help. After contacting the station, Joe reached out to United once again, explaining that he was hospitalised and was unable to travel during the 18-month period. When he attached a note from his doctor verifying his claims, United agreed to reinstate his 270,000 miles. \nHowever, PIX11 reports the station had to contact the airline in regards to reinstating Marilyn’s points and only then were her 52,000 miles refunded. \nWhile the Woerners agree they learned a valuable lesson about points and miles, their message is clear: Airlines should stop expiring miles. \n“It just seems to me once you earn them, you ought to be able to keep them,” says Joe. \nnews.com.au has contacted United for comment. \nThis story originally appeared on FlyerTalk.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:59:10.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
