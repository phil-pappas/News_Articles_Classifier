On Tuesday, players took part in a mock fashion show at the Costa Rican Football Federation’s Proyecto Gol to unveil the third uniform that all Costa Rican football teams will wear in international play.\nThe third Costa Rican uniform made by fitness apparel company New Balance keeps the collars featured on the previous red and white kits, but adds red pinstripes to the frontside of the latest jerseys. A faint font blended into the dark blue base reads “La Sele” over the right hip while “Costa Rica” is emblazoned in a more visible white font on the back of the neck.\nLa Sele head coach Óscar Ramírez got into the fashion craze on Tuesday, showing off an impressive beer gut as he donned the jersey with his old No. 10, which he wore during skinnier times as a player on the national team.\nFEDEFUTBOL president Rodolfo Villalobos and men’s national team head coach Óscar Ramírez may not be running out on the pitch anytime soon, but they still got to sport La Sele’s new jerseys on Tuesday.\n(Courtesy of FEDEFUTBOL)\nThe team is slated to debut its blue uniforms for Costa Rica’s next friendly, an Oct. 8 meeting with South Africa in San José’s National Stadium. On Tuesday, Ramírez confirmed that star goalkeeper Keylor Navas will join the team after missing both of the friendlies in September due to the botched trade between his club Real Madrid and English Premier League’s Manchester United.\nThe blue kits are on sale in select stores and will set you back about $80-$90 for men’s and women’s short or long sleeve replicas. Kids and baby jerseys are also available.\n¡Ya la puedes conseguir! pic.twitter.com/2cWN19xbKr\n— FEDEFUTBOL (@FEDEFUTBOL_CR) September 29, 2015\nContact Michael Krumholtz at mkrumholtz@ticotimes.net", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaSele?src=hash", "http://t.co/2cWN19xbKr", "https://twitter.com/FEDEFUTBOL_CR/status/648968224072146944", "https://twitter.com/FEDEFUTBOL_CR/status/648884893498236928", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/gI5wRbQSM74?feature=oembed", "http://t.co/FCDVj0w5pg"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:13:35.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
