LGBT tourism potential in Japan Original,   \nOct 02, 2015 eTN   \nThe recently concluded JATA Tourism Expo in Japan underlined the importance the Japanese Government and Tourism leaders put not only on outbound travel, but even more on making Japan a major inbound destination. Leaders mentioned for JATA Tourism Expo to become one of the world's most important travel industry event. \nFor the first time Japan recognized The LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) tourism market for inbound travel to this country. Japan has a vibrant LGBT community, but the travel industry both for inbound and outbound has ignored this market. \nA spokesperson for the Hawaii Tourism Authority, an exhibitor, said there was no interest and demand in Japan to justify for Hawaii to reach out to the LGBT community in Japan. Hawaii was in Tokyo attending JATA Tourism Expo with an emphasis on weddings, but this did not include same sex weddings. \nThis may be the typical understanding and has remained an unmentioned potential in Japan and many other Asian countries even with an active LGBT community. Contrary to Hawaii tourism experts and others and surprisingly, the Japan Association of Travel Agents (JATA) held a seminar “Understanding the LGBT Travel Market” at JATA Tourism Expo Japan 2015 at Tokyo Big Sight for the very first time. It was one of the seminars offered on September 25 for travel trade professionals and media visiting Tourism Expo Japan. \nJATA invited Ms. LoAnn Halden, Communications Director, IGLTA (International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association), as a speaker for this presentation. IGLTA is an international association based in Florida, U.S.A. \nJATA stated: \"In Japan, the number of foreign travelers has been increasing rapidly by 30% to 40% each year; in 2015 it will reach 19 million at the urging of the Japanese government’s aggressive measures and policies. Given this situation, JATA recognizes the LGBT potential for the Japanese inbound market and organized this seminar.\" \nThe seminar had the highest number of travel trade professionals in attendance, and the highest media participation of the day, even though hosted media was not told about the event. This showed the high level of interest not only from the tourism industry but also in our society. \nOne of the local participants mentioned the need for more statistical data in terms of both quantity and quality to make the proper approach to the market. Further effort to understand the LGBT community is certainly necessary. \nScott Foster of LGBT Hawaii said the potential for Hawaii was enormous to look promoting to LGBT visitors in Asia, specifically from Japan, the number one Asian market for the Aloha State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:46:10.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
