Warren Lynam Local Real Estate \nTHIS small, Sony camera travelled the world while its owner was hard at work in Nambour. \nNambour Print Centre owners Peter and Jeannie Rosendale filled their camera with priceless memories as they ventured to the world's largest air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, took in the Harley Davidson Museum in Milwaukee and strolled through Beverley Hills and Hollywood. \nMr Rosendale thought they were lost forever when he discovered the camera missing. \n\"I was annoyed with myself because I couldn't remember where I'd left it, so I rang around the places we'd been to and no one had it,\" he said. \n\"On the long flight home I kept hoping it was right down the bottom of the bag.\" \nOn unpacking, he discovered that wasn't the case and decided to call the Californian stores again in case it had surfaced. \nAmazingly, he struck gold. \nIt was sitting beside the counter of a major pharmacy at Manhattan Beach. \n\"On the last day of the holiday, I'd decided to buy a pack of razors and I'd left it on the counter where I paid for them,\" he said. \nThe next two weeks were filled with phone calls trying to make arrangements to have the camera sent back to Australia. \n\"I was happy to pay to get it over here, but they didn't seem to get anything happening,\" Mr Rosendale said. \n\"I was beginning to think it was all getting very difficult when Greg Pitman walked in to have some maps of the USA copied for his upcoming holiday.\" \nPrompted by his wife, Mr Rosendale recounted their story of loss and Mr Pitman offered to collect the camera on his holiday. \nHe spent an hour on the bus, with a changeover at LAX Airport, to finally track it down. \n\"I set about posting it back to him, but FedEx wanted $130 and the US postal service wanted $54, so I ended up taking it with me around the world,\" Mr Pitman said. \nWith the camera in tow, he travelled to Panama, Barcelona, Lisbon, Zurich and Thailand over six weeks before returning the camera to its grateful owners. \nWhile he was thrilled to get his camera back, Mr Rosendale said he found it ironic it had enjoyed a more extensive holiday than he had. misplaced camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:16:47.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
