(NYSE: ALSN), the largest global provider of commercial duty fully-automatic transmissions, today reported net sales for the third quarter of $493 million , an 11 percent decrease from the same period in 2014. The decrease in net sales was principally driven by lower demand in the global Off-Highway end markets partially offset by higher demand in the North America On-Highway end market and price increases on certain products.\nAdjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the quarter was $123 million , compared to Adjusted Net Income of $138 million for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $15 million . Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the quarter was $174 million , or 35.3 percent of net sales, compared to $202 million , or 36.5 percent of net sales, for the same period in 2014. Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the quarter was $142 million , or $0.81 per diluted share, compared to $164 million for the same period in 2014, or $0.91 per diluted share.\nLawrence E. Dewey , Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Allison Transmission commented, \"Allison's third quarter 2015 results are within the full year guidance ranges we provided to the market on July 27 . Net sales in the North America On-Highway end market improved on a year-over-year basis for the ninth consecutive quarter. The year-over-year reductions in the global Off-Highway and Service Parts, Support Equipment & Other end markets net sales are consistent with the previously contemplated impact of lower energy and commodity prices. We anticipate no meaningful relief from the global Off-Highway end markets challenges in the fourth quarter and are affirming our full year net sales guidance of a decrease in the range of 6 to 8 percent year-over-year. Allison continued its prudent and well-defined approach to capital allocation during the third quarter by settling $181 million of share repurchases, paying a dividend of $0.15 per share and repaying $6 million of debt.\"\nThird Quarter Net Sales by End Market\nEnd Market\nQ3 2015\nNet Sales ($M)\nQ3 2014\nNet Sales ($M)\n% Variance\nNorth America On-Highway\n262\n256\n2%\nNorth America Hybrid-Propulsion Systems for Transit Bus\n12\n23\n(48%)\nNorth America Off-Highway\n12\n30\n(60%)\nDefense\n34\n35\n(3%)\nOutside North America On-Highway\n67\n73\n(8%)\nOutside North America Off-Highway\n4\n18\n(78%)\nService Parts, Support Equipment & Other\n102\n118\n(14%)\nTotal Net Sales\n493\n553\n(11%)\nThird Quarter Highlights\nNorth America On-Highway end market net sales were up 2 percent from the same period in 2014 principally driven by higher demand for Highway Series models and down 5 percent on a sequential basis principally driven by lower demand for Rugged Duty Series models.\nNorth America Hybrid-Propulsion Systems for Transit Bus end market net sales were down 48 percent from the same period in 2014 principally driven by lower demand due to engine emissions improvements and non-hybrid alternatives that generally require a fully-automatic transmission (e.g. xNG) and down 40 percent sequentially principally driven by intra-year movement in the timing of orders.\nNorth America Off-Highway end market net sales were down 60 percent from the same period in 2014 principally driven by lower demand from hydraulic fracturing applications and up 20 percent on a sequential basis principally driven by intra-year movement in the timing of orders.\nDefense end market net sales were down 3 percent from the same period in 2014 principally driven by reductions in U.S. defense spending to longer term averages experienced during periods without active conflicts and up 17 percent sequentially principally driven by intra-year movement in the timing of orders.\nOutside North America On-Highway end market net sales were down 8 percent from the same period in 2014 principally driven by lower demand in China partially offset by higher demand in Europe , and down 8 percent on a sequential basis principally driven by lower demand in Europe and India .\nOutside North America Off-Highway end market net sales were down 78 percent from the same period in 2014 principally driven by lower demand in the energy sector and down 50 percent sequentially principally driven by lower demand in the energy and mining sectors.\nService Parts, Support Equipment & Other end market net sales were down 14 percent from the same period in 2014 principally driven by lower demand for North America service parts and up 9 percent on a sequential basis principally driven by higher demand for North America service parts.\nGross profit for the quarter was $236 million , a decrease of 9 percent from $259 million for the same period in 2014. Gross margin for the quarter was 47.9 percent, an increase of 100 basis points from a gross margin of 46.9 percent for the same period in 2014. The decrease in gross profit from the same period in 2014 was principally driven by decreased sales volume partially offset by price increases on certain products, favorable material costs and lower incentive compensation expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $87 million , a decrease of 1 percent from $88 million for the same period in 2014, principally driven by lower incentive and stock based compensation expense, and reduced global commercial spending activities partially offset by unfavorable product warranty adjustments.\nEngineering – research and development expenses for the quarter were $24 million , a decrease of $1 million from $25 million for the same period in 2014, principally driven by lower incentive compensation expense.\nThird Quarter Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Net Income for the quarter was $123 million , compared to $138 million for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $15 million . The decrease was principally driven by decreased sales volume and unfavorable product warranty adjustments partially offset by price increases on certain products, favorable material costs, lower incentive and stock based compensation expense, reduced global commercial spending activities and decreased cash interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $174 million , or 35.3 percent of net sales, compared to $202 million , or 36.5 percent of net sales, for the same period in 2014. The decrease was principally driven by decreased sales volume and unfavorable product warranty adjustments partially offset by price increases on certain products, favorable material costs, lower incentive compensation expense and reduced global commercial spending activities.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for the quarter was $142 million compared to $164 million for the same period in 2014, a decrease of $22 million . The decrease was principally driven by decreased net cash provided by operating activities and decreased excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation.\nFull Year 2015 Guidance Update\nWe are affirming the full year 2015 guidance ranges released to the market on July 27 : net sales decrease of 6 to 8 percent year-over-year, an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.75 to 35.75 percent, an Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $470 to $500 million , capital expenditures of $60 to $70 million and cash income taxes of $10 to $15 million .\nAlthough we are not providing specific fourth quarter 2015 guidance, Allison does expect fourth quarter net sales to be lower than the same period in 2014. The anticipated year-over-year decrease in fourth quarter net sales is expected to occur due to lower demand in the global Off-Highway and Defense end markets.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe company will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET on Tuesday, October 27 to discuss its third quarter 2015 results.
