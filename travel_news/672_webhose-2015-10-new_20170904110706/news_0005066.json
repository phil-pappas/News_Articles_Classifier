Other players begin to understand your game. You’re in the spotlight a little bit more and players realise you’re a threat and a danger. There’s more focus on you. We’ve seen it with the likes of Israel Folau – he’s played well but they’ve shut him down very quickly. The same thing happened to George North. When he came on the scene, nobody really knew too much about him . They could see he was big and physical but they didn’t realise he was quick and has great feet and vision as well. The more experience you get, and the more you play rugby, the more people start to focus on your abilities and look to shut you down. And, of course, they will try to shut him down. He’s a danger. I thought he had a good game against Australia. Defensively, he did very well in a position he wasn’t too familiar with. It was a positive game for George and that will give him confidence. George won't get the freedom he once had. He should be flattered but he needs to adapt as well The final group match between Australia and Wales was thrilling. Defensively both teams were superb. The 10 or 12-minute period where Australia went down to 13 men ironically won them the match. They stuck together and defended superbly. They didn’t concede any points in that length of time. It revitalised them and they went on to play better rugby than us. In attack, both teams did whatever they could to cross that line. Wales crossed it three times but couldn’t touch the ball over the line. As a spectator, it was a fantastic game of rugby, despite the fact there were no tries. I think the past couple of years probably have been dominated by defences. However, this World Cup has proven that teams can manipulate defences, they can score tries. Japan proved it against one of the best defences in Rugby World Cup 2015 . We’ve seen some fantastic games in the competition so far. If anything, apart from that Wales-Australia game, I don’t think the games in this World Cup have been dominated by defences. The teams have really gone out to score tries. It’s really encouraging. We’ve seen a lot of tries in this World Cup. We’ve seen a lot of teams concentrate on their attack just as much as their defence. Two or three seasons ago it was starting to get a bit monotonous. Big defences and not conceding tries would win you matches. But I think this World Cup has been the turning point. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed every match I’ve watched. I’ve seen some teams really have a go in attack and come away winning games by scoring tries rather than defending. In boxing terms they went toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world. They should have scored at least one of those tries, but they couldn’t quite get it down over the white line. But they can hold their heads high. What they will be disappointed with is not scoring any points in that period where Australia were down to 13 men. But you have to give credit where credit’s due, and Australia defended superbly. The positives outweigh the negatives in that game and they can take a lot of heart from it. They’re still in the World Cup. There’s no point dwelling on a negative. You should just try and learn from it and move forward. They’ve got a big game on Saturday against South Africa and if they defend like they did against Australia they’ve got more than a fair chance of winning. George has shown his mettle playing out of position, and not having as much space as he’d naturally like. But that’s mental toughness. It doesn’t always go your way. In boxing terms they went toe to toe with one of the best teams in the world When you first come on the scene you score tries and you just think you can do this week in, week out. The thing is, other players and other teams are keeping an eye on you. They regard George North as a key player for Wales. And when you play against teams with key players, you do your damnedest to make sure they’re quiet, not involved in the game and certainly not scoring points. George is not going to get the freedom he once had. He should be flattered by that, but he needs to adapt as well. Sometimes it’s not all about yourself breaking lines, scoring tries and coming off with a man of the match performance. Sometimes it’s about putting other players into these gaps, putting other players into scoring positions and going through the motions and having a good game and making sure the team wins. It’s not always about yourself. It’s great scoring tries and being man of the match, but you can’t do that week in, week out because you’re playing against the best teams in the world. They’ve done their homework on you and will know you inside out. I haven’t seen any of the Wales guys since the second game of the World Cup. I know what it was like when I was playing. Everyone wants a piece of you and wants to speak to you. I’ve left them alone. I’ll speak to them after the World Cup when hopefully they’ve won it and I can celebrate with them. At this point, the best thing to do is leave them alone and let them spend as much time as they can relaxing with their families. It’s a long time away. It’s intense, leading up to the World Cup – you’re away in training camp, and your whole focus as a player is winning, and making sure you’re fit and fresh and ready for it. Sometimes your time with your family and friends suffers because of this. A little bit of time with your family is great and it can take a little bit of pressure off. It can almost make you forget about what’s happening. It’s not good for your health or your mental preparation to be thinking about the quarter final every day of the week. I’m sure these guys enjoy the break and the time with their family. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:35:17.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
