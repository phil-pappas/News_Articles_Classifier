The index assigns countries and cities a single numerical score, from satisfying (10) to miserable (1).\nCosta Rica scored 4.5 points while El Salvador obtained 2.1 points. In Latin America, Argentina ranked as the best country to drive in with 7 points, followed by Mexico with 6 points.\nThe evaluation took into account six factors, including traffic level by frequency and severity of traffic jams; road quality and infrastructure; driver safety based on accidents; road hazards and weather; and driver services, like access to gas stations and easy parking. It also looked at socioeconomic factors, including access to cars and impact of gas prices, and finally the “Wazeyness,” or the level of helpfulness and happiness within the Waze community.\nThe 10 countries that offer the best conditions and best driving experience for their drivers are the Netherlands, Latvia, USA, Sweden, Czech Republic, Belgium, France, Italy, Hungary and Slovakia.\nContact L.
