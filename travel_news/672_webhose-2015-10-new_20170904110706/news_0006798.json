At first I was only going to do 100km but then I thought I probably won't get many chances to do this sort of thing so I said let's do the whole thing. \n\"Lots of people take loads with them but we decided to just take a few clothes and the bare essentials. We didn't plan or book anything, we just started walking and worked out where to stop along the way.\" Mansell told the Lancashire Evening Post. \nMansell, a keen walker, who is a member of her local Ramblers club, and her granddaughter, began their journey in Pamplona, in Spain's north east, before making their way across Spain. Along the way the pair stayed in hostels (albergues) which they booked by simply walking in and asking for vacancies. \nFROM THE ARCHIVES:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:37:19.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
