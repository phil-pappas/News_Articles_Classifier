Deep, calming breaths. In out, in out. My hands shake with nerves, and my brow glistens with a sheen of sweat that has nothing to do with the winter sun. This mild panic attack isn’t a response to what are, for me, intimidatingly large jumps – but to the unofficial and unwanted audience over at the top of the expert line. Go to any terrain park, and you will find them. A group of guys, their low-hanging, baggy trousers teamed with an over-sized t-shirt reaching to the knees. Their goggle marks are so pronounced their faces nearly resemble racoons, while their park and pipe twintips or snowboards are emblazoned with graphics that boldly reflect their fearlessness. What’s a bruised tailbone compared to a bruised ego? This troop will stake out the park for the entire day, armed with GoPros , a six-pack of beer and a sadistic streak. Much like a dog taking a whizz to mark its territory, they lounge around the snow between hits, mercilessly judging those who dare to use what they clearly think of as their own private playground. If you have the guts to head down the slope, you have two anxieties to quash. The first, that in catching a little air on the novice jumps you might misjudge the speed and end up landing painfully on your bottom; the second (and far worse), that snorts of derision from the park posse will follow, causing waves of beetroot-faced embarrassment. For what’s a bruised tailbone compared to a bruised ego? If you're capable of speeding down a jump before landing a 540 without breaking a sweat, these tyrannical terrain parkers create an atmosphere much like that of a weight room at the gym. Intimidating, overtly masculine and clearly not a welcoming environment for the inexperienced – it takes some real staying power to have a bash as a beginner , especially when faced with such rampant testosterone. It's not easy being green Photo: 2015 Getty Images Of course, there are plenty of women capable of wiping the floor with these jokers – I doubt GB Park & Pipe's Aimee Fuller would give them a second glance – I just wish I was one of them. I dream of the day I can make my way down the expert line in a swift and cool fashion, effortlessly tackling each feature to whoops of admiration. Unfortunately, if practice makes perfect, one must actually use the park to improve. So to all those park rats out there – the ones who sit and snigger at us piste bunnies when we put pride to one side and have a punt – give us a break, please. As Kermit the Frog can attest, it’s not easy being green; but we’re trying our best. Want to have your say or got something else to rant about?
