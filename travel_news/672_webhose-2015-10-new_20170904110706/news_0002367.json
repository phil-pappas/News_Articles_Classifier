Currently PIA – Pakistan international airlines is the only airline serving the route between Pakistan and the UK with direct flights to 3 of its major hubs in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi.\nThe new airline previously offered budget styled airfares competing with PIA and Airblue at that time the fares from the UK to Pakistan were at their lowest ever with round trip prices starting at less than £300.00 on average during certain off peak seasons. The news could not have come any sooner for the Pakistani communities based throughout the UK, since airblue’s departure from Birmingham and Manchester , PIA have steadily increased fares with record hitting prices during peak seasons now averaging around £1000.00+ for a return flight from London, Birmingham and Manchester.\nShaheen air is due to start operating flights from Nottingham east midlands and Manchester international airport beginning in or around March 2016. There is no official news on the type of aircraft and days of operating although it is suggested the airline will operate 2 airbus a330-200 type aircraft from each of the airports with up to 5 flights planned to take place each week.\nThe sale of tickets is due to begin in the first week of November 2015, Mushtaq Travel will be offering Shaheen air tickets to customers , hinting the prices being as low as £300 when they first officially go on sale, further information about the airline including booking and pricing details be found here . This will surely have an impact in the market will other airlines competing for this popular route that may be forced to slash their prices significantly in order to compete with each other.\nAbout.\nMushtaq Travel is one of the UK’s most established Pakistani Travel Agents offering trade and retail flight only services on over 60 major international airlines including Pakistan International Airlines, Emirates Airlines, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, Saudi Arabian, Turkish Airlines, KLM, Air France and many more.
