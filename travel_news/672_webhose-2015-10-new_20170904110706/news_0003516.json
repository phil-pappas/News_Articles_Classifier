Scheduled to open in 2018, the new hotel will bring a vibrant new blend of cutting-edge design and international hospitality to the city, and the region.\n \nBest Western’s new chic, hip boutique concept, Vîb is designed to combine value and style. Blending social engagement with the latest technology and smart, ergonomic design, Vîb will appeal to Southeast Asia’s savvy travelers.\n \n“When we first revealed the Vîb concept to the world earlier this year, it was clear that this unique, contemporary product would work extremely well in Southeast Asia – one of the world’s most dynamic regions,” said Olivier Berrivin, Best Western Hotels & Resorts’ Managing Director of International Operations – Asia.\n \n“It is extremely exciting that we have signed our first Vîb hotel in the region, and there could not be a better setting for it than Vientiane – an exciting up-and-coming regional hub. We look forward to bringing a new era of hospitality to the rising number of visitors to the Lao capital,” Mr. Berrivin added.\n \nThe new Vîb hotel will be located in the center of Vientiane, close to the night market, Lao National Museum, Black Stupa and Patuxai Arch.\n \nAll 70 rooms will be designed with comfort, convenience and connectivity in mind, including sleep-inducing beds, well-placed international adaptors and complimentary Wi-Fi. The hotel will also feature a social lobby area, “grab n’ go” snack station, and a “Zen Zone” for relaxation.\n“Since we introduced Vîb, we have received tremendous interest from developers around the world. This project in Lao is our ninth Vîb underdevelopment globally and we are in active discussions with a dozen others,” commented Ron Pohl, Best Western Hotels & Resorts’ Senior Vice President of Brand Management.\n \n“We are delighted to have signed our first Vîb hotel in Southeast Asia, and I am confident this marks the start of a strong regional roll-out for the brand,” Mr. Pohl added.\n \n \nSource:- Best Western", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:41:43.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
