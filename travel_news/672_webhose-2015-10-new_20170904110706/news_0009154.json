Carillion (Other OTC: CIOIF - news ) got a boost on Friday as JPMorgan Cazenove upgraded its stance on the construction and support services company to 'overweight' from 'neutral' as it took a look at UK contractors. \nJPM said the UK non-residential construction market is in recovery mode with meaningful opportunities in both the building and infrastructure markets. The bank said it sees the greatest potential at Interserve , Carillion and Kier Group (LSE: KIE.L - news ) . \nAs far as Carillion is concerned, the broker noted that shares have declined by 16% since their last peak in August, which it sees as unjustified, particularly as they are supported by a 10% free cash flow yield in full-year 2016 and a 6% dividend yield. \nDepartment store operator Debenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) was a high riser again after it posted growth in annual pre-tax profit on Thursday thanks to solid progress made against its strategic targets. In the year to 29 August, the group saw pre-tax profit grow 7.3% year-on-year to £113.5m on the back of an improved stock-controlling strategy and on a drastic cut down on promotions, while revenue grew 0.4% to £2.32bn. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in William Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) slumped after the bookie warned that full-year operating profit will come in at the bottom end of analysts' forecasts as a result of additional taxes on the gambling industry and a tough comparison with last year. Chief executive James Henderson said: \"Q3 was always going to be a tough quarter given last year's World Cup and very strong gross win margin, allied to £23m of additional gambling duties this year.\" AA was in the black after Berenberg initiated coverage of the stock at 'buy' with a 350p price target. \"With a new strategy in place, we expect a return to growth in personal breakdown cover and more crossselling, which, combined with strong cash conversion, will drive significant deleveraging,\" said the bank. \nBuilding products company SIG (LSE: SHI.L - news ) was on the back foot for a second day running after it revealed on Thursday that it is expecting a fall in underlying pre-tax profit for the year due to challenging market conditions in mainland Europe. For the nine months to 30 September, the company's like-for-like sales were up 0.2%. In the UK and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) it was up 2%, but mainland Europe down was 1.7% compared to the same period last year. \nRisers Ocado Group (Other OTC: OCDGF - news ) (OCDO) 369.40p 6.58% Carillion (CLLN) 319.10p 6.30% Cable & Wireless Communications (LSE: CWC.L - news ) (CWC) 74.40p 6.29% AA (AA.) 277.30p 5.64% Henderson Group (LSE: HGG.L - news ) (HGG) 282.90p 4.86% Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 129.20p 4.79% Petra Diamonds Ltd (LSE: PDL.L - news ) .(DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (PDL) 87.75p 4.78% Debenhams (DEB) 87.40p 4.30% Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) (EMG) 166.10p 4.14% Polar Capital Technology Trust (PCT) 595.00p 4.02% Fallers William Hill (WMH) 314.70p -8.89% Micro Focus International (Other OTC: MCFUF - news ) (MCRO) 1,172.00p -4.79% Indivior (Berlin: 2IV.BE - news ) (INDV) 204.40p -4.04% Home Retail Group (HOME) 115.20p -4.00% SIG (Stuttgart: QIG.SG - news ) (SHI) 136.30p -3.67% Cineworld Group (LSE: CINE.L - news ) (CINE) 577.00p -3.03% Nostrum Oil & Gas (Stuttgart: 3NO.SG - news ) (NOG (Taiwan OTC: 5279.TWO - news ) ) 465.80p -2.00% Zoopla Property Group (WI) (ZPLA) 255.00p -1.92% UDG Healthcare Public Limited Company (UDG) 458.30p -1.80% Spire Healthcare Group (SPI) 376.20p -1.78%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:41:14.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
