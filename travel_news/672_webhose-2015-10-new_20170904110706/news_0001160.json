Set independently, the Living Wage is an hourly rate calculated according to the basic cost of living in the UK. Currently set at £7.85 an hour, it is £1.35 an hour more than the national minimum and employers opt-in to pay it on an entirely voluntary basis. \nSundial’s Managing Director, Tim Chudley, has also been personally recognised for his commitment to driving the Living Wage campaign and has been shortlisted for a Leadership Award in the East Midlands region. Sundial’s Barnett Hill, was the first hotel conference centre to become a Living Wage employer and Chudley remains at the forefront of a movement to help raise awareness and encourage further take up of the Living Wage within the hospitality industry. Commenting on the awards, Tim Chudley said: “I could not be more chuffed that Barnett Hill and I have been honoured as shortlisted champions for the Living Wage in the UK. I am passionate about this initiative and recognise that success in the hospitality industry depends on the professionalism and motivation of our front-line people, but, our sector is way behind in rewarding the dedication of our people. Others need to wake up and realise that paying fair wages will benefit their businesses.\" Living Wage Foundation Director, Rhys Moore said: “I would like to send huge congratulations to Barnett Hill and Tim Chudley on being shortlisted for the Living Wage Champion Awards. The commitment of Living Wage Employers to responsible pay makes a life changing difference to families and communities across the UK. We look forward to celebrating this even further when announcing the winners of the Awards during Living Wage Week.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:35:02.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
