The survey results were released as part of National Teen Driver Safety Week ( Oct. 18-24 ), during which driver training leader eDriving – the parent company of DriversEd.com and I Drive Safely – is giving away more than 2,000 hours of online driver training for teens.\nTop Three Surprising Teen Driver Mistakes & Tips for Parents of New Drivers\nFor the survey, DriversEd.com asked its state-licensed drivers ed instructors to list the top three driving mistakes they observe teens make during their on-the-road lessons. Best known across the country for its interactive online driver education courses for teens, DriversEd.com also operates one of the nation's largest behind-the-wheel programs, with professional driver training instructors and state-approved behind-the-wheel driver training schools in California , Texas , and Georgia .\nInstructors' top three surprises were:\nCockpit Confusion: Whether it's mixing up the wipers and the turn signal, or the gas pedal and brake, a surprising number of learning students don't know their way around the inside of the car. TIP: Parents should make sure that teens get well-acquainted with the location of important vehicle controls before the car is put in motion. Every time a teen drives an unfamiliar vehicle, taking a couple minutes to get acquainted with the controls is essential. Blind to Blind Spots: Despite being told over and over, many new drivers don't check their blind spot before changing lanes, merging, or backing up. TIP: Parents need to demonstrate good driving behaviors when they're behind the wheel and reinforce this critical check while practicing with their teens. Is the Turn Signal Broken?: Every car has a turn signal. Too many new teen drivers don't use them. TIP: Parents must be good role models, signaling every time they change lanes, turn or otherwise should be using a signal. They should expect the same of their teens. \"Our behind-the-wheel instructors work with thousands of teens and their families every year to help them develop the skills and perception necessary to be smart, skilled drivers,\" said Celia Stokes , CEO of eDriving. \"Parents play a critical part in the process – as role models, coaches, cheerleaders, disciplinarians, and more. While this can be one of the most stressful stages in a parent-teen relationship, it is also one of the most important to get right.\"\nThe eDriving 2,000 Hours of Driver Ed Giveaway\nAs part of National Teen Driver Safety Week, eDriving is giving away more than 2,000 hours of online driver training for teens.
