( AXP - Get Report ) stock is rising 0.12% to $77.04 in midday trading on Wednesday, as the company is expected to report its earnings results for the third quarter of 2015 today after the market close. \nThe company is expected to report a year-over-year decline in earnings per share and revenue. \nAnalysts have estimated earnings of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.32 billion for the latest quarter. \nLast year, American Express posted earnings of $1.40 per share on $8.33 billion in revenue for quarter ended September, 30, 2014. \nNew York City-based American Express is a provider of charge and credit payment card products, as well as travel-related services to consumers and businesses. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates AMERICAN EXPRESS CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate AMERICAN EXPRESS CO (AXP) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its good cash flow from operations, reasonable valuation levels and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Net operating cash flow has increased to $2,175.00 million or 35.93% when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of 22.61%. Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 12.9%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 4.1%. The declining revenue appears to have seeped down to the company's bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. AMERICAN EXPRESS CO reported flat earnings per share in the most recent quarter. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. We feel it is likely to report a decline in earnings in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, AMERICAN EXPRESS CO increased its bottom line by earning $5.55 versus $4.88 in the prior year. For the next year, the market is expecting a contraction of 0.9% in earnings ($5.50 versus $5.55). The company's current return on equity has slightly decreased from the same quarter one year prior. This implies a minor weakness in the organization. When compared to other companies in the Consumer Finance industry and the overall market, AMERICAN EXPRESS CO's return on equity exceeds that of the industry average and significantly exceeds that of the S&P 500.
