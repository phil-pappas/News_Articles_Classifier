It was built at the same time, most likely by the same queen, and while less showy and grand it's nevertheless beautiful and elegant, with sculptural niches climbing up the narrow walls. It's \"protected\" by the local government (even though chunks are falling from it and bonfires have been lit within) but easily accessible through an adjacent temple.\" Hide Caption 8 of 18 18 photos: Chand Baori, Abhaneri, Rajasthan – \"Chand Baori is one of the better known stepwells thanks to it's cameo appearance in several movies. But still, tourists generally miss the short detour off the road between Jaipur and Agra and if they realized it, they'd kick themselves. It's one of the oldest, deepest, most impressive wells or 'kund,' defined by the sculptural geometric steps on all four sides and steep funnel shape. It's impossible to take a bad photo of a kund...\" Hide Caption 9 of 18 18 photos: Helical vav, Champaner, Gujarat – \"When I give lectures, the so-called Helical vav invariably causes gasps -- something about that sinuous spiral and severe simplicity is so compelling. Even more startling -- as with many stepwells -- is the subtlety of it's above-ground presence: just a low masonry wall. Lovely.\" Hide Caption 10 of 18 18 photos: Rajon ki Baoli, Delhi – \"There are a number of really wonderful stepwells in and around Delhi, some just a few yards from main tourist attractions, and yet even local guides have no idea that they exist or how to find them. Rajon ki baoli is located in the Mehrauli archeological park, itself a magical place studded with tombs and ruins. It's deep, in good shape, still harvests water, and its many levels of \"apartments make it such a fun place to explore.\" Hide Caption 11 of 18 18 photos: Mukundpura baoli, Narnaul, Haryana – \"It's not easy getting to this small stepwell in the fields outside the city of Narnaul, with its many spectacular Mughal monuments. But the dirt road eventually lead to pretty -- if overgrown -- stepwells, with its four chattris that come into view. What a peaceful spot in its day - I'm sorry this one's such a ruin.\" Hide Caption 12 of 18 18 photos: Ujala baoli, Mandu, Madhya Pradesh – \"The fort at Mandu has a number of stepwells, tanks, and sophisticated water-harvesting systems but none as beautiful as Ujala baoli. The picture doesn't show what an odd, asymmetrical structure it really is, or it's sadly dilapidated state.\" Hide Caption 13 of 18 18 photos: Mertaniji ki Baoli, Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan – \"It's so steep and in such terrible condition that Mertaniji looks as though it's weeping filthy tears - but it's also an enormous feat of engineering and architecture. An estimated 25% of stepwells were commissioned by women, and this is one of them -- another \"protected\", awe-inspiring monument that unfortunately has all sorts of garbage in it.\" Hide Caption 14 of 18 18 photos: Raja Bir Singh Dev baoli, Serol, Madhya Pradesh – \"A farm family cares for this stepwell, using it as it was in past centuries: for drinking, washing, and irrigation. It's large scale, huge entry towers, and architectural details make it another of my favorites -- an unexpected treasure way out in the countryside.\" Hide Caption 15 of 18 18 photos: Derelict Baoli, Fatehpur, Rajasthan – I always show this baoli, or stepwell, as an example and reminder of how a unique, awe-inspiring, formerly essential monument can be reduced to rubble. I had to climb on a roof to even see the extent of this marvel, one of the largest I've encountered, and which must have been an incredible sight hundreds of years ago. Now it's surrounded by buildings, used as a dump, and no-one has any idea it's there. It made me cry.\" Hide Caption 16 of 18 18 photos: VIKIA VAV, GHUMLI, GUJARAT – \"I'd read about Vikia Vav in Morna Livingston's book \"Steps to Water\" from 2002 and was determined to find it on a search mission in Gujarat. It was by far the most difficult to locate and get to. Even local villagers had no knowledge of it, seemingly, and I was eventually led to it along a dirt track by a sympathetic fellow on a motorcycle. (The road) had so many rocks that my driver lost a tire. It's (from the) late 13th century, in the middle of nowhere on a former trade route, and nearly destroyed by the horrific earthquake in Gujarat in 2001. But marvelous still.\" Hide Caption 17 of 18 18 photos: Mahila Bag Jhalra, Jodhpur, Rajasthan – \"This is another example of a kund, small but powerfully sculptural. The gradation of hues from pink to white to green (from algae) makes it one of the most colorful of all the stepwells I've visited, and it's a particular favorite.\" Hide Caption", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:30:14.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
