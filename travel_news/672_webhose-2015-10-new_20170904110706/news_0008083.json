We launched flights between Accra and Washington in cooperation with Africa World Airways. The introduction of the Accra to Washington route has seen a steady growth in passengers using the route and has performed in line with expectations. This has also enabled us to invest further and enhance our West Africa footprint.” \n“Enhancing air travel links with Nigeria also underlines the growth in bilateral relations between South Africa and Nigeria. The two countries historically have had strong economic, diplomatic, social and fraternal ties with both being economic powerhouses of Africa.” \nAccording to Tim, the Abuja flights have been scheduled for seamless connectivity into SAA’s route network to and from international cities which means passengers can reach Nigeria with one stop in Johannesburg. \nWith Abuja, SAA will now serve eight destinations in Central and West Africa, with flights from Johannesburg to Lagos (Nigeria); Abidjan (Ivory Coast); Cotonou (Benin); Accra (Ghana); Douala (Cameroon), Dakar (Senegal) and Libreville (Gabon) already forming part of the extensive regional route network. \nThe three weekly flights will operate non-stop between Johannesburg and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja aboard modern Airbus 330-200s, offering SAA business class comfort and luxury, with the latest in In-flight entertainment. The first flight is scheduled to depart O.R Tambo International Airport on 26 January 2016. Flights are open for sale on all SAA’s distribution channels. \nAbuja flight schedule:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:51:54.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
