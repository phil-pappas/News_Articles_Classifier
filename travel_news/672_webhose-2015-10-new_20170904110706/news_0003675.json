Research suggests these nutrients may help protect against age-related macular degeneration – a condition that leads to the gradual loss of central vision as you get older. “Leafy greens are packed with antioxidants that can help protect eye health, too,” he adds. Tuck in. 8am: Slip on smart lenses Blue light has been shown to have more potential to damage your eyes. You’re exposed to it through the sun and, although less so, digital devices. So if you’re a glasses wearer, consider investing in lenses that filter out the harmful parts of blue light, such as Crizal Prevencia. Pop them on before you head out, for protection throughout the day. Artificial lighting pumps out blue light, which may not only be harmful to your eyes but also signals to your body clock that it’s time to be awake 9am: Apply the 20:20:20 rule If you work at a computer, Hepworth has this advice: “Every 20 minutes, look away from your screen to a distant object for 20 seconds and make an effort to blink 20 times.” This can help ward off eye fatigue and strain, so you don't have square eyes come afternoon. 1pm: Pack a peeper-friendly lunch When it comes to your sandwich, ditch the white stuff. “A diet containing foods with a low glycemic index (GI) can help protect your eyes as you age, so swap refined carbohydrates for whole-wheat bread, whole-wheat pasta, brown rice, quinoa and whole oats,” advises Hepworth. Perhaps not all in one sitting, though. 1.30pm: Be sun savvy If you’re popping out for a lunchtime stroll, remember UV rays from the sun can damage your eyes (for example, contributing to cataracts) year round, so slip on some sunnies or, if you’re a glasses wearer, opt for Transitions or clear lenses with in-built UV protection such as any of the Crizal UV Protective range, including Crizal Prevencia. Fun in the sun: Crizal Prevencia will protect your eyes from UV damage Photo: Getty 5pm: Work up a sweat Exercise can help prevent high blood pressure, which can damage eyesight. In fact, a study published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology found that participants who had an active lifestyle were 70 per cent less likely to develop age-related eye disease than those with a sedentary lifestyle. So ditch the excuses and head to the gym after work. 7pm: Serve up a steak “In moderation, lean beef in your diet can boost your eye health. It contains zinc, which helps your body absorb vitamin A and may play a role in reducing risk of advanced age-related macular degeneration,” explains Hepworth. Serve it up with salad or veg – the greater the variety of colours the better, as they’ll be packed with different nutrients. Think tomatoes, peppers, greens and more. 9pm: Dim the lights Artificial lighting pumps out blue light, which may not only be harmful to your eyes but also signals to your body clock that it’s time to be awake. So, as the evening draws in, turn any unnecessary lights off to give your eyes a break – and help you unwind before bed.
