But is the bank a good investment? Here are the views of some top fund managers. Steve Davis, Jupiter UK Growth Mr Davis said: \"British banks are the best and last recovery/value story in the market. The easy money has been made with the challenger banks so it's time to look at the 'old school' ones.\" Of these, his favourite is Lloyds, which is his fund's largest holding. Profits have improved dramatically, it has better margins on loans, has got rid of the duplication that came with the HBOS merger and, with the UK economy improving, things are \"shaping up nicely\". Bank balance sheets are also generally much improved thanks to increased regulatory requirements, Mr Davis said, while spare money that had until now been spent on PPI claims could be returned to shareholders if, as is widely expected, a cut-off date is set for such claims. \"There are risks of course, such as more fines and the review of retail and small business banking. But I am positive,\" he said. • How to invest in discount Lloyds shares Alex Wright, Fidelity Special Situations Mr Wright, who manages Anthony Bolton's former fund, said he expected Lloyds to yield 4.5pc next year , based on the current share price, and a whopping 7pc in 2017. Currently, Lloyds, which resumed dividend payments in February after the financial crisis caused their suspension, yields just 1.5pc. Mr Wright said: “The issue with Lloyds and most of the banks was that balance sheets were overleveraged going into the financial crisis. So you have needed to see an awful lot of capital build up to improve the balance sheets of those businesses. “Lloyds is towards the end of this journey and the cash generation of the company is very high. So when you see that it is on nine times earnings you only need a 60pc to 70pc dividend payout of the cash generated to get to that 7pc yield. “While there are still political concerns about how quickly it can ramp up that dividend, in economic terms the bank has the ability to pay that figure today.” Stephen Message, Old Mutual UK Equity Income Stephen Message, who manages the top-performing Old Mutual UK Equity Income fund, said he expected Lloyds to become a top 10 dividend payer by 2018. He told Telegraph Money in April that banks were becoming more “utility like” as a result of increased regulation . This should be seen as a positive, he said, because banks should stick more to their core operations and retreat from riskier areas. Mr Message said this would mean that banks would in future years pay a higher proportion of their earnings as dividends. “The dividend returned was £500m in February, but in three years’ time it is forecast to rise to £2.5bn,\" he said. \"This would represent 2pc of the entire UK dividend market and would lead to higher interest in Lloyds’ shares from the investors who are sitting on the sidelines. “But the main reason why I am excited is that Lloyds’ bosses have indicated that a high proportion of its earnings will be returned to shareholders.” The consensus earnings forecast, over the next three years, is that profits will be 8p per share, Mr Message said. “On this assumption the dividend will be 4p per share and based on the current share price of 78p that would give a yield of 5pc. “I think it could be even higher, given the future potential growth: the yield may reach 6pc in three years’ time.” And the bears... Not all fund managers are bullish about Lloyds or British banks in general. Terry Smith of Fundsmith, who has achieved impressive results by focusing on firms that can make high and consistent returns on their assets, has said he will never hold banks , partly because of their dependence on borrowed money. And Neil Woodford, another respected investor, warned last year that banks faced \"unquantifiable\" fines from regulators . As a result, he sold his last holding of bank shares, those of HSBC. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:37:45.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
