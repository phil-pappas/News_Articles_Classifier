The firm, in its quarterly ‘dividend monitor’ report, cautioned dividend growth will be just 3pc in 2016, down from the 6.8pc that is expected this year. In pounds and pence Capita predicts £87.2bn of total dividends in 2015 and £89.8bn the following year. The commodity sell-off, which has already forced some businesses, such as Glencore, to halt payments, is likely to claim more victims, the firm said. • 15 biggest income paying shares - how safe are their dividends? Justin Cooper, chief executive of Shareholder Solutions, part of Capita Asset Services, said the FTSE 100’s high weighting to mining shares will put the brakes on the index’s income payments. This, combined with the fact that average dividend cover for the UK stock market, the degree to which a company’s profits exceed its dividend, is at a 20-year low , spells danger for income investors. But as things stand today – the dark clouds on the horizon has not yet had a negative impact. In the three months to the end of September the total amount paid out by British companies was up 6.8pc year-on-year. “Income investors have had terrific dividend payouts in 2015 so far, shrugging off some high profile casualties like Tesco. But the outlook is gloomier,” Mr Cooper said. “Profits are lower relative to dividends than at any time since 2009, and we have seen some of Britain’s biggest dividend payers announce drastic cuts for the year to come, with the prospect of more to follow.” • Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of our investment ideas How to avoid the dividend crunch… But it is not all doom and gloom, small sized shares with strong growth potential are tipped to weather the storm. Over the past quarter the average share in the FTSE 250 index increased their payouts by 11pc, Capita noted, ahead of the FTSE 100, where the average share upped divis by 4.9pc. This slice of the market has a greater domestic flavour to it than the FTSE 100, so therefore performs well when Britain's economic growth is buoyant. Smaller sized shares are also less affected by big global trends, such as the falling oil price. 10 small sized shares that are reliable payers Just like with the big income heavyweights small investors should focus on whether shares have certain qualities when looking for a reliable dividend payer that is listed outside the FTSE 100. Good omens include a strong past track record of paying dividends. Another is a positive forecast dividend score, as this indicates the share is expected to continue growing their dividends in a year’s time. ShareScope, a trading service for DIY investors, has screened for these two factors and found 10 shares that fit the bill. Each share has increased dividends for the past decade and is expected to increase their divi again in 2016. Some of the names in the table below will be more familiar than others. • Find out our five golden rules for DIY investing Pennon Group, the water utility firm, is perhaps one of the more recognisable. It has promised to pay a dividend that will rise by 4pc above inflation until 2020 . Outsourcing firms scored well, with Carillion, Interserve, Mite Group and Paypoint all featuring. In the table below, the other five names are listed, along with the forecast dividend cover score. As a rule of thumb those that score above 2 are considered safe. The dividend stars of tomorrow Separately ShareScope also screened for shares that are expected to be big dividend payers in the coming years. Each share has a yield lower than the average share in the FTSE 100 today – 3.8pc – but are expected to ramp up their payments and return a greater portion the money they make to shareholders. To win a place on the list below each share had to have grown its dividend for at least five years, a healthy dividend cover score above 2 and a “cheap valuation”, with the price to earnings ratio below its five year average. Funds that target the hidden gems For those who prefer to outsource the investment decisions to an expert there a handful of UK equity income fund managers who prefer to fish out the FTSE 100 for income shares. These include Standard Life UK Equity Income Unconstrained, Ardevora Income and the Royal London UK Equity Income. Other options are Marlborough Multi Cap Income and Miton Multi Cap Income.
