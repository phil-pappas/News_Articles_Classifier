You morph into “the you” you’ve always imagined yourself to be. The most adventurous you. The daredevil version of you. Best outdoor activities in Belize. \nMountainous jungles bring out the hiker in you, and the inner zipliner. There are reefs for your inner snorkeler and diver. Ancient Mayan Ruins and Caves for your inner explorer. Waterfalls for your inner rappeller. And, at the end of each day’s adventures, Rhum Bars on the beach will definitely bring you out to kick back in a beach hammock and end the day with a delicious pina colada.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:09:00.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
