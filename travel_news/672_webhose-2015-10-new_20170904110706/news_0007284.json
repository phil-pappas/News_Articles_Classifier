Scams typically involve an unsolicited email or telephone call appearing to be legitimate but in reality is designed to trick the individual into providing various elements of personal information, sometimes by offering prizes and discounts. It is important to note that NACC airlines (Air Canada, Air Transat, Jazz and WestJet) do not use any form of telephone solicitation or promotion nor do they seek to obtain personal information via email. Customers should avoid clicking on any links or attachments of suspicious emails. The NACC also encourages anyone who receives emails or telephone calls they believe to be fraudulent to file a report with the National Do Not Call List and the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre .
