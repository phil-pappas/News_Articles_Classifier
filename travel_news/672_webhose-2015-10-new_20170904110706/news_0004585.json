The injured man was taken to hospital following the emergency landing. \nThe deceased was travelling alone and it is not believed he was Irish, but may have been studying in the country. \nAer Lingus issued a statement on Sunday night about the incident saying the plane was forced to land due to a “medical emergency on board”. \nThey said: “Aer Lingus flight EI 485 Lisbon to Dublin, diverted into Cork due to a medical emergency on board. \n“There were 168 guests and six crew members on board. The flight landed safely at 17.40 local time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:29:30.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
