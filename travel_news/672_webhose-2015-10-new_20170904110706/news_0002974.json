Marian Thier agrees there's more to bleisure travel than simply ticking off a few tourist attractions.\nIn fact, her clients often foot the bill for her to arrive a or two early, so that she can be rested and focused when it's time to start the job.\n\"To get our best work, we cannot be exhausted when we get there, and in the scheme of things it probably saves the client money because people are more engaged,\" she says.\nBusiness and pleasure\nTaking a bleisure trip doesn't always mean flying solo.\nAccording to Skift more than half of those who do bring family or a significant other along.\nSarah Cloninger, a corporate trainer who writes the Road Warriorette blog about business travel, tries to bring her spouse and children along when possible.\n\"My husband has been on business trips with me all over the U.S.,\" she says.\n\"Once my son was born they were still able to join me on several of the more fun locations like Las Vegas, beaches, the mountains,\" Cloninger adds.\nSavvy travelers can even find ways to turn what could be a joyless business assignment into a memorable trip for two.\n\"A while back I was on a working trip to Singapore,\" says Harriet Baskas, a Seattle-based multimedia journalist and author of Stuck at the Airport blog. \"We cashed in airline miles so my husband could meet me there and share my very nice hotel accommodation.\"\n\"Singapore was on our 'to do' list, but this made it possible to do it now.\"\nApp-oriented planning\nThere's a consensus among bleisurites that research is key when it comes to making the most of limited time in a new location.\nBut many hit the ground running with the help of apps.\n\"I always try to buy a local SIM card so I've got cheap mobile data,\" says Bruce, who uses the Moovit app to get real-time public transport information all over the world.\n\"You experience far more and enjoy it better on public transport than in a taxi so I try not to use Uber unless I really have to because of odd flight times or tight deadlines,\" he says.\nCloninger relies on review sites Yelp and Urbanspoon (recently bought by Zomato ) to find restaurants in unfamiliar cities, and trawls travel message boards to get tips on sites to see.\nBut is it ever really that enjoyable to mix business and pleasure?\n\"Travel is now a part of work,\" says Marian Thier, \"so anything that you can do to make yourself more relaxed, focused and more present is what people should be looking for, not just ticking off the next leg of your journey.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.yelp.com/", "https://www.zomato.com/", "http://skift.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BGH-Bleisure-Report-2014.pdf", "http://moovitapp.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008181642-istanbul-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008181642-istanbul-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://roadwarriorette.boardingarea.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008181642-istanbul-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008181642-istanbul-large-169.jpg", "https://twitter.com/stuartbruce?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008181642-istanbul-small-169.jpg", "http://stuckattheairport.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008181642-istanbul-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://xtho.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151008181642-istanbul-super-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:13:25.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
