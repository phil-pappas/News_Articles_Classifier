The award serves to celebrate and inspire change in the digital infrastructure and services made available in meeting venues around the world.\nThere will be two categories to submit an award entry:\nConvention Centres\nConvention Hotels\nThis year, we are pleased to announce our strategic partners that are supporting the promotion of the award, ICCA, Best Cities, IMEX and the IMR.\nThe INCON Award rests on a simple principle that meetings are better when a first class digital infrastructure is made available along with applications and tools that enhance the delegate productivity and experience. Award judge Bob Heile explains: “just having the right equipment is not enough – how to configure and organise it is the secret to success.” Bob is founding member of the ZigBee Alliance, having effectively written the rule book for wireless standards he is the perfect judge for the Award. He is also involved in more than six different conferences on WIFI and digital communications annually where he tests at first hand the quality of digital communications in venues across the globe. Bob together with an international panel of judges will review the nominations and the winners will be announced at IMEX Frankfurt in April 2016.\nRoslyn McLeod, INCON Co Chair has said: “now in its third year, INCON looks forward to receive entries for this year’s award and encourages all venues to review the best practice case study from last year’s winner MCEC.\nApplication forms are accessible from the INCON website: www.incon-pco.com/award. There is no entry fee. All it takes for a venue to be considered is to fill in an application with full details about your venue and return it by 29th February 2016.\nAbout INCON\nINCON is a partnership of the world’s leading conference organisers and event management companies.
