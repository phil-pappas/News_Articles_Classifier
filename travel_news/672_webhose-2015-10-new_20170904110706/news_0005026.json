Or, at least, simple-ish – not like today with our thousands of new syndromes, issues and social media conditions that quite simply didn’t exist 20 years ago. Or even five years ago. For your benefit - to help you keep up with your grandchildren , we've rounded up the modern social syndromes triggered by the modern world. Do you have a 21st century syndrome? Photo: Alamy Instagram anxiety Scrolling down Instagram , it's easy to slip up and lo! an accidental skim of the thumb over the heart that designates 'like'. Not a problem, usually, unless you're 'creeping' on someone's old pictures. This is Instagram-liking anxiety – also applicable to Twitter and the naughty favourite button , and old Facebook profile pictures . But Instagram is your primary enemy here – it’s too easy to get ‘heart-happy’. Beware. Insta-scroll at your peril. How to prevent it: Put down your phone. Keep your hands steady when scrolling through photographs. Photo: AFP Too-many-tabs headache That thing where you’ve got loads of tabs open on your computer? It didn’t happen back in the day. Why? Before the internet existed computers didn’t have the option to have tabbed browsing because there was nothing to browse. And thank goodness. Before that, it didn’t make practical sense to have 30 tasks on the go at once. Too messy. This is something to be cautious of: your children and grandchildren might be well adept to having a hundreds of things on the go at the same time, but it’s headache-causing. Beware. How to prevent it: Close some tabs, or, failing that, revert to Internet Explorer where it's practically impossible to load more than one thing at once, anyway. Compulsion to get your inbox to zero Few things are more OCD-like than attempting to get your inbox down to zero. Whether it’s on Gmail or your iPhone where the red blob of 361 is haunting your dreams, that nagging feeling not having lingering unreads in your inbox is a very real one. Back in the day this couldn’t happen simply because letting your correspondence pile up like that was just incredibly uncouth. The issue is too many emails. That’s what you tell yourself, anyway. How to prevent it: Unsubscribing from email lists is simplest, but if you can't bear to miss the Boden sale, take some deep breaths and manage your inbox. You can do it, promise. Photo: Alamy The absolute horror of getting a call from an unknown number The 20th century must think us all very precious if we can’t even receive a call from an unknown number without getting upset. But if you’re not ready for it – or have an unknown number contingency plan, a la working in an office where all numbers are unknown, or having your home phone blocked for security reasons – then the question falls as to what to do next. Photo: Matt Pritchett Do you pick up and risk it? Or do you ignore it and risk the second most horrifying mobile phone problem – the voicemail . This ranks highly in the top few things that your children dread. Just don’t leave them. Ring back another time – or send a text. Anything but the voicemail. How to prevent it: You, er, can't. But learning to be brave and answer the phone to strangers wouldn't hurt. The inability to wait for anything This isn’t specific to your offspring: we’ve all caught the bug. The district line isn’t going to arrive for three minutes? The absolute indignity of it all! Simply how dare it! The modern world has bred impatience like it’s going out of fashion. Ironically, patience is. Let’s blame Amazon Prime and the fact that you can get whatever you want delivered free the next day. How to prevent it: If on public transport, get a book and read it and you'll forget you're even waiting. Photo: Richard Watt Your friend’s irritating habit of taking a photograph of absolutely everything Why? Because they want to capture the moment. Well, you say, why not just live in the moment? Impossible. It’s the 21st century, and the moment is no longer important. It’s about taking a picture of the moment. Especially annoying when food is involved. How to prevent it: Ask politely if you can start your meal - if at dinner - because you're hungry. Otherwise, photo-bomb everything until they cease and desist.
