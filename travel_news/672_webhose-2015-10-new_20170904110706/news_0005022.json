My friend and I are booking a mini OE mid next year around Europe, including Spain, Ireland and Greece. Where can we look for great deals and packages, including flights? Any other helpful information would be awesome. \nA. My advice would be to drop into your closest House of Travel and have a chat with one of our great travel consultants â€“ they can provide some awesome ideas and insights into helping create an amazing OE that is tailor-made to meet all the needs, as well as adding some special touches. \nYour consultant will also help you download the House of Travel App. It can provide fantastic help with your forthcoming trip, such as full access to your itinerary, a secure forum to store valuable information and a means to stay in contact with your travel specialist. It also has an Inspire section which may just offer a couple of additional experiences you haven't yet thought of. \n- Dave Churchman, owner, House of Travel, New Plymouth \nGot a travel question?
