Sheri Hurley installed a commercial kitchen a decade ago to process her own blackberries, raspberries and peaches and to make private-label preserves for wineries and others. A Colonial-era drink, the shrub has resurfaced in contemporary bars as a mixer with rum or vodka. Made by macerating fruit overnight with sugar, then straining off the juice and adding Champagne vinegar, Hurley’s sweet-tart shrubs make sprightly additions to sparking water or sparkling wine as well. $8/6 ounces. 2083 Silverado Trail, Napa, (707) 257-3683, www.hurleyfarms.com. \nNapa Soap Co. \nAllow plenty of time to sniff through the 29 different scented bars produced on the premises in this country-chic soap kitchen. For that hint of terroir, every bar contains grapeseed oil and a splash of wine; some include local honey, lavender or olive oil. Handsomely packaged in handmade mulberry paper with pressed bougainvillea and marigold petals, the soaps sell individually or in a three-bar gift box. What oenophile wouldn’t love lathering up with Soapignon Blanc or Clean O Noir ? Individual soaps $9.95, three-bar gift box $34.85. 651 Main St., St. Helena, (707) 963-5010. www.napasoap.com. \nPope Valley Pottery \nEnglish ironstone inspires Kelly Farley ’s sleek, spare pottery — pristine plates, footed fruit bowls, pitchers and vases with a farmhouse aesthetic. Function comes first for Farley. His forms are straightforward and simplistic, his surfaces unadorned. Archetype, the Howard Backen -owned restaurant in St. Helena, displays Farley’s porcelain, and the artist himself peddles his tableware at the St. Helena and Napa farmers’ markets in season. Any home chef would itch to whisk up some aioli or vinaigrette in one of this potter’s elegant mixing bowls. $28-$85. Call or e-mail for appointment and address. (847) 217-3456 or kelly@popevalleypottery.com. \nAceto Balsamico di Napa Valley \nThis luscious condiment comes to the table with the ultimate high-society credentials. Its birth parents include Margrit Mondavi , Maria Manetti Shrem, architect Dante Bini and John Traina , who dreamed up the project over dinner more than two decades ago. Fortunately, this dream team had both the patience and deep pockets to see their finicky vinegar to adulthood — a path that required repeat visits from an Italian consultant and several venue moves. Worth the wait? Assolutamente . Mondavi recommends dispensing the raisin-scented elixir like a miser — one drop on a fried egg; two drops on a steak. $130/4 ounces. Robert Mondavi Winery , 7801 St. Helena Hwy., Oakville, (707) 226-1395 . \nRound Pond Pomegranate Syrup \nMake a dinner-party dessert in two minutes with Greek yogurt, candied walnuts, pomegranate seeds and a drizzle of this ruby elixir. The condiment deftly dresses up a modest sparkling wine and can free up your inner bartender. Made from fruit grown on the property, the syrup has Meyer lemon and blood-orange counterparts. $18/200 ml. Round Pond Estate, 875 Rutherford Road, Rutherford. (888) 302-2575. www.roundpond.com. \nNapa Cakes Panforte \nRiffing on her grandmother’s fruitcake, Marjorie Caldwell devised her dense, spicy panforte with no intention of monetizing it. But seven years ago she baked some for an Obama fundraiser, and a chef-friend sent an unsold round to Cowgirl Creamery. “Suddenly I was in business,” says Caldwell, who has since doubled her repertoire to include an apricot-almond version in addition to the original. $ 17-$20/eight ounces. (707) 944-8626 (wholesale bakery). Available at Genova Deli, Oxbow Cheese Merchant and Fatted Calf in Napa; Oakville Grocery in Oakville; Sunshine Foods in St. Helena; and Blackbird in Calistoga. www.napacakespanforte.com. \nParsley Pappardelle \nWhole leaves of Italian parsley pressed into the dough make Pasta Poetry’s noodles almost too lovely to eat. Almost. Yes, they’re a splurge as pastas go, but they only need butter to make a big impression. Serve with osso buco or all alone with just a dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano. $12/8 ounces. Available at Whole Foods and Hudson Greens & Goods in Napa and Sunshine Foods in St. Helena. \nPanevino and Sub Rosa Salumi \nDavid Katz and Mimi Martin were nearing burnout in the catering business when Martin made the bread sticks that changed their lives. By putting her bread dough through a pasta machine, she produced skinny, snappable, irresistible grissini that every tasting room had to have. Sayonara, catering. Panevino, their handmade bread stick company, is now 5 years old and straining to meet demand. Now Katz has built a state-of-the-art curing chamber in his bakery to support his salumi habit. His Sub Rosa Salumi — try the garlicky Saucisson Provençal — have Old World flavor, but you don’t have to hide them in your socks to get them home. \nSalumi, $14; grissini, $9. 1080 Fulton Lane, St. Helena, (707) 963-2786. www.salumeriasubrosa.com. \nLavender Pluot Preserves \nClif Bar founders Gary and Kit Erickson supply both the fruit and the lavender for this conserve from their Pope Valley farm. Arresting in flavor and not overly sweet, the jam should click with Manchego and other aged sheep’s milk cheese. $12. Clif Family Kitchen at Velo Vino, 709 Main St., St. Helena, (707) 968-0625. www.cliffamilywinery.com.
