National governments have even begun to 'temporarily' suspend the Schengen agreement - the treaty that gives most EU citizens the right to travel freely across European borders - with the argument that the influx of migrants and refugees poses a \"serious threat to public policy or internal security.\"The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein recently strongly criticized the Hungarian government for breaching international law, saying the country's harsh measures are \"an entirely unacceptable infringement of the human rights of refugees and migrants. Seeking asylum is not a crime, and neither is entering a country irregularly.\"The forum says that the UNWTO must stop acting like a PR agency for the travel and tourism industry and genuinely work for the common good of humanity as deemed appropriate for a UN body.\"It is unreasonable and immoral to talk about '1 billion opportunities' including livelihood opportunities for the poor, while disregarding all research and scientific data that reveal tourism's vast opportunity costs, including displacement, dispossession and impoverishment of people particularly in the developing world.\"The forum calls for an impartial and sincere review of tourism to explore the question: tourism offers opportunities for whom?\"Victor Hugo's saying \"The paradise of the rich is made out of the hell of the poor\" appears perfect to describe tourism in a world of growing inequality and receding human rights.\"Valere TjolleBig changes on the way, find out the opportunities free dossier HERE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:05:49.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
