Every itinerary is carefully planned to open up to guests the world’s must-see treasures and landmarks – from ancient glaciers in Alaska to the walled metropolis of Quebec, the antiquities of Egypt to majestic Burmese pagodas, sun-drenched Caribbean shores to iconic Mediterranean sites. Only Regent Seven Seas Cruises offers a complimentary and unlimited shore excursion programme on every cruise. This is a highlight worth trumpeting. It means that in every port of call, you can participate in as many guided tours, cultural adventures, eco-hikes or gentle private strolls as your curiosity and stamina can muster. You can opt for full days or half-days, active forays or passive tours, outings that include a group lunch or free time to wander about a site independently. Groups are limited to no more than 30. You are sent off with a complimentary bottle of water and welcomed back on board with a champagne greeting. The emphasis is on providing truly special, personal travel experiences, not overcrowded coach tours and rushed whirls through packed museums As every destination has its own collection of museums and attractions, Regent’s excursions for small groups give you scope to explore the history, culture and cuisine in the ports of call without having to worry about planning, logistics or extra expense. Regent has the local knowledge and the on-shore experience. All the organising has been done for you. In Alexandria, for example, it is possible to both steep yourself in Ancient Egyptian life in the library and museum and venture out of the city to the battlefields of El Alamein. From the Australian city of Cairns, you can hop on a luxury catamaran to a marine world activity platform and immerse yourself in the natural beauty of the Great Barrier Reef. And from the Alaskan city of Anchorage, you can discover the Kenai fjords, ride a tram to a glacier top and see wildlife up close at a conservation centre. Blue is the colour: excursions can provide a personal travel experience Part of the fun of planning a cruise is mulling over the excursion options. No matter how well travelled you may be, the world has plenty of unsung thrilling surprises. Whether you visualise yourself walking the ancient pathways of Ephesus and Jerusalem, trekking through a Thai tropical jungle in Phuket on a bejewelled elephant or making chocolate in Estonia, you can book online up to 240 days before your sailing. If you change your mind, no worries. The on-board destination service team will help make alternative plans for you. The emphasis is on providing truly special, personal travel experiences, not overcrowded coach tours and rushed whirls through packed museums. Excursions are laid on to allow guests to pursue their own interests, be that history, nature, sport, dance, cooking lessons, walks, battlefield pilgrimages or ancient culture. For those seeking more intrepid adventure into a region, check out Regent Choice shore excursions. These unique and bespoke shore trips – fishing in Tallinn, a full-day private exploration of Manaus on the Amazon River, 18 holes of golf in Acapulco – require a highly discounted supplementary charge to partially offset the cost of their more extravagant nature. It is rewarding to go on a cruise to pursue an interest, and even better to return with new passions. On selected journeys, the shore excursions are complemented by the Smithsonian Collection, an inspirational enrichment programme of on-board lectures led by a wide range of specialists from noted art historians to leading authors and former diplomats. Keen to share their first-hand knowledge and enthusiasms, your Smithsonian Collection lecturer sails with you for the entire duration of your voyage, encouraging an interactive exchange of ideas. You can dine with them and attend Q&A sessions before or after select shore excursions to expound on information gleaned by your local tour guide.
