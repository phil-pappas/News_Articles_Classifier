Created in partnership with American Express Global Business Travel (GBT), the report surveyed over 350 Corporate Travel Managers around the world to explore the future of travel policy. \nA key question for The Evolution of Travel Policy is the balance between savings and service in policy. Over the last 1 - 2 years, 52% of respondents say savings was the primary driver of their managed travel program, followed by duty of care (23%) and traveler service (16%). \nLooking ahead, the balance between savings and service is expected to change significantly as Corporate Travel Managers look to traveler behavior, rather than supplier cost reductions, to drive savings. 84% of respondents say savings will be achieved through demand management and compliance in the next 1 - 2 years. However, the research suggests the communications tools to drive compliance are often missing: 44% of respondents say they have no formal systems in place for gathering feedback from their travelers. \nWhile 75% of Corporate Travel Managers surveyed for The Evolution of Travel Policy see improved traveler service as a route to savings, few organizations have measures in place to justify these improvements to procurement or finance leaders. 21% of respondents today use traveler productivity metrics, 9% use work-life balance metrics and just 5% use stress reduction metrics. However, 12% of Corporate Travel Managers say they plan to introduce stress reduction metrics in the next 1 - 2 years. \nCommenting on the findings, Caroline Strachan, Vice President of Global Business Consulting at American Express Global Business Travel, said: “Demand management is the bedrock of a strong managed program so it’s hugely significant to see that travel managers are embracing the traveler and traveler service. Clearly, they understand the future’s going to be traveler-centric. What’s less clear, is whether travel managers feel they have the right technology and tools needed to deliver this future.” \nStrachan continued: “Communication is critical for building relationships, engagement and compliance. The research suggests there’s scope for travel managers to upgrade their communications systems and practice.” \nMetrics are another area for attention identified by Strachan: “Traveler-centric metrics help travel managers convince their colleagues about the value of service improvements. The research shows progress here – but travel managers should consider how they can better capture the impact of travel on their travelers.” \nGreeley Koch, Executive Director at the Association of Corporate Travel Executives, said, “The Evolution of Travel Policy study confirms a major shift among business travel managers, identifying a stronger emphasis on supporting the traveler in meeting corporate objectives, as opposed to savings alone. The report’s findings are consistent with ACTE’s Traveler Centricity education pillar, which puts the traveler and the traveler’s needs at the heart of policy.” \nKoch pointed out that influencing traveler behavior and supporting the traveler in the field is far more conducive to meeting the primary objective — raising corporate revenue — than savings alone. “While savings remain a key driver, profitability is the objective of business travel.” \nAmong the traveler considerations featured in The Evolution of Travel Policy are initiatives for improved traveler service. Highlights include: \n• Pre-trip messaging: 30% of organizations have already deployed these services, and 27% aim to introduce them in the next 1 - 2 years. \n• Mobile booking: 29% of organizations have mobile booking today. A further 30% of Corporate Travel Managers plan to implement within 1 - 2 years \n• Mobile Apps for in-trip changes: deployed in just 16% of organizations today, over the next 1 -2 years 31% of Corporate Travel Managers plan to implement \nWith sharing economy travel options a focus of interest across the travel industry, the research finds lukewarm attitudes among Corporate Travel Managers. While 13% have included ground transportation sharing options, and a further 13% plan to implement in the next 1 - 2 years, 39% say these options are not even on the agenda. With accommodation sharing options, 13% have implemented policy, 8% plan to introduce policy in the next 1 - 2 years and over half (56%) rule them out altogether. \n“These figures may be more indicative of a mindset than practical application,” said Koch. He added that ground transportation decisions are often made in the moment by travelers on the road, not by travel managers based in corporate headquarters. “Accommodation decisions are a different and more complex story,” said Koch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:13:05.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
