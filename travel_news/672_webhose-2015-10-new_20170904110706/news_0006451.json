Each boat could carry five tourists, who are charged 100 baht each. Life jackets were also provided. \nBottles of vinegar were also prepared to provide first aid to tourists in the event they were stung by the poisonous box jellyfish, said Mr Somjit. \nPornthep Wisetpol, a visitor from Chanthaburi, said he took his family for holidaying in Trat to view the colourful jellyfish. He was also impressed by an abundance of marine life in Trat. \nTom Khampankaew, 60, of Lampang, said it was her first trip to Trat as her family wanted to see the the jellyfish bloom. \nA close-up picture of jellyfish in Trat sea.
