The plane had arrived from Las Vegas and was headed to Frankfurt, Germany.\nAmerican spokeswoman Andrea Huguely (HEWG'-lee) said Thursday that a beekeeper and the airline's team did a \"sweet job\" taking care of the situation. No one was stung.\nHuguely says the beekeeper safely removed the queen and the swarm. Cargo from Las Vegas was removed and workers started loading bags for the Frankfurt flight.\nBut the queen's scent apparently lingered. Bees quickly headed for the same spot.\nThe beekeeper returned and removed those bees, allowing the flight to eventually take off.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:18:42.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
