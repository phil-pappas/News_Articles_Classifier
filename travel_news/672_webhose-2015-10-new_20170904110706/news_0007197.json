Report OSPREYSAINT Sir Enry Rawlinsunshine 10:54am Wed 21 Oct 15 \nYou seem to revel in self worship, and have little respect for others judging by your contributions, I am never sure whether you mean it, or just having a tease, so I shouldn't really judge you, because I am guilty of a lot teasing too. Try a bit of hero worship, or at least show some respect, it doesn't do any harm. Since the creation of man, there have always been heroes, whether it be in war, or sport, or other activities, decent humans appreciate the acts of bravery and endeavour carried out by others. In following football a lot of us get immense pleasure watching the skill of talented people, so much so that we pay hard earned money to get the privilege, it obvious isn't your bag but that is no excuse for slagging off those that do, there are rather a lot of us.
