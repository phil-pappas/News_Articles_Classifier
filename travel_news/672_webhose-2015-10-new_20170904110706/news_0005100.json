This is an initiative of the Executive Chef at Ephelia, Nicolas Baube, and has the aim of promoting and developing the Seychellois culinary talent within the industry while at the same time promoting Constance as the culinary reference in Seychelles in training and development of people in turn improving the image of Constance Hotels in Seychelles. The target for this training are the Certificate in Food Preparation and Culinary Arts students from STA, the Seychelles Tourism Academy, who do two days of theory at the school and four days of practical within the industry. This Chef Academy is the first of its kind to be officially launched in the Seychelles, and the students will benefit from the tutelage of all the Chefs de Cuisines at Constance Ephelia Seychelles. \nThe Patron of STA, the Seychelles Tourism Academy, commended the fact that there were 9 girls out of the 15 trainee chefs who are part of this new training program. He made his expectations clear that he hopes that more girls are attracted to study food preparation and culinary arts and that we may eventually have more female executive chefs in the Seychelles. \nThe Seychelles Minister for Tourism and Culture, Mr. Alain St.Ange, welcomed such an ingenuity and commended Constance Ephelia Seychelles. He also placed emphasis on the Seychelles Tourism Academy to keep on building strong partnerships which the local hotels as this is what will make the academy prosper. He explained that STA, the Seychelles Tourism Academy, alone cannot nurture students to meet the needs of the hotel industry. \"We need the hotels to assist their Tourism Academy in the learning process of the students,\" said Minister St.Ange. Both Mr. Claude Narain and the Minister Alain St.Ange stressed on the fact that learning is a never-ending process. \nAll invited guests were invited for a buffet of all the delicacies that the students had learned to prepare during their internship at Constance Ephelia Seychelles. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
