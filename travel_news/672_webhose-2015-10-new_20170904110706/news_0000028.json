Four Seasons Hotel São Paulo at Nações Unidas is expected to open in 2017, with Private Residences to follow.\n \nThe luxury Hotel and Private Residences will be located at a large-scale, 82,000 square metre (880,000 square foot) mixed-used development including lush green spaces in the southern part of São Paulo known as Parque da Cidade, one of the fastest developing areas in the city. The focal part of the project will be a modern and elegant 29 story tower with 16 floors occupied by the Hotel and 13 floors for the residential units.\n \nIron House is a subsidiary of Grupo Cornélio Brennand, a centennial Brazilian family corporation active in four business areas: renewable energy, float glass, cement and real estate. Iron House plans to be active in the São Paulo real estate market at the upscale residential level as well as with luxury hotel services. Construction on the Four Seasons project began last December and is expected to be complete in 2017, the year in which the Group will celebrate its hundredth anniversary.\n \nCommenting on the project, Iron House CEO Ruy Rego said: “Four Seasons was one of the pioneers of the concept of a luxury hotel with branded residences and this model is now present in key cities worldwide. We, at Iron House, together with our investment partner, are proud to be bringing Four Seasons to Brazil, and the city of São Paulo is the right place for such a landmark project, the first of its kind in Brazil.”\n \nThe 254-room Hotel and 84 Private Residences will be the first foray into Brazil for Four Seasons. The iconic luxury brand is known for operating some of the best hotels in the world including Four Seasons Hotel George V, Paris, Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane and Four Seasons Hotel New York in addition to award-winning resorts in Bora Bora and the Maldives. The company is also a pioneer and industry leader in managing branded residential products, since first introducing the concept in 1982.\n \n“Having a presence in Brazil is essential as we explore growth opportunities across Latin America,” said J. Allen Smith, President and CEO, Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts. “Brazil is not only a popular destination for luxury travellers, but Brazilian outbound travellers represent a significant number of Four Seasons guests around the world. Soon our Brazilian guests familiar with Four Seasons properties internationally will have an opportunity to experience Four Seasons at home.”\n \nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:28:13.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
