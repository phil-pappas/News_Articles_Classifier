Photo Credit: Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong. \n\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, has launched an afternoon tea set menu that will be served at Cafe 103 through 1 January. \nHotels across Hong Kong have been launching afternoon tea sets one after another. It seems to be a trend, with chefs at each hotel trying their best to outdo each other. \nThe Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, is latest to enter the fray. What sets this afternoon tea set apart from the afternoon teas being served at other Hong Kong hotels is that it is MOSTLY about chocolate. \nMake that Godiva Chocolate, to be precise. But not exclusively. There are a couple of sweets without chocolate as well as some mouth-watering sandwiches. \nWhat is interesting - and it has been frequently commented upon by food critics - is the absence of chocolate at most of the afternoon tea sets being served at other hotels. \nAre the chefs at the Ritz-Carlton on to something? \nCafe 103 Cafe 103 at the Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, a 5 star hotel in Kowloon.

Each one of the biscuits on the menu is reminiscent of one of the continents he has visited. \nBut Chef Jean didn't come up with the menu single-handedly. \nExecutive Chef Peter Find, Executive Pastry Chef Richard Long, and Godiva’s Chef Chocolatier, Pacific Rim and China, Philippe Daue, collaborated with Chef Jean in creating the set menu, which also includes some mouth-watering sandwiches. \nAnd if that brief description doesn't your taste buds flowing, maybe these photos will! \n\nGodiva Sablés Fine Butter Biscuits Afternoon Tea Photo Credit: Rtiz-Carlton, Hong Kong.

It is one of 6 food and beverage outlets at the hotel. Other outlets include ... Ozone , the world's highest bar; Tin Lung Heen , a fine dining restaurant serving Cantonese cuisine; Tosca , featuring an innovative Italian menu prepared in an in an open kitchen; The Lounge and Bar , an all-day dining venue serving afternoon tea accompanied by jazz; and Almas Caviar Bar, Caviar House, and Prunier , which serves Prunier caviar, Balik smoked salmon, and champagne before or after dinner. \nWhere \nCafe 103, 103rd Floor, The Ritz-Carlton, Hong Kong, International Commerce Centre, 1 Austin Road West, Kowloon, Hong Kong.
