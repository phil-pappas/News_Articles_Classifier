So high-spending Chinese visitors, we absolutely want them to grow. In all, the market is worth about half a billion pounds to Britain at the moment, we want to double that in the next four years. So that's a really ambitious growth target to come.\" \nIn the meantime, Yates also mentions some disadvantages in UK tourism compared with some other countries. \n\"One of the things that we don't have, Britain is typically a very well-connected country, we're an island, we have to be, the route development isn't as good as China as we would like it to be. So I think getting more routes approved, getting those into regional airports, absolutely a focus for us in the next few years.\" \nData from VisitBritain shows that the number of Chinese tourists to the UK grew to 185 thousand last year, with per capita consumption in the country standing at nearly 2700 pounds, or over 4100 U.S. dollars.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:21:37.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
