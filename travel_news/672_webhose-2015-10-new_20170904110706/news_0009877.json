It reveals notes from the customary nutty, fruity, chocolate and spicy to the less obvious animal-like, rubber-like and winey ones. A roasted coffee bean contains more than 800 aroma compounds – so many that in the mid-Nineties the Speciality Coffee Association of America invented a handy Coffee Flavour Wheel to try to simplify things. Chefs have long harnessed the power of the bean’s perfect bitterness to balance and enhance dishes. Depending on how long a bean is roasted for and thus how dark its flavour, it can be matched with foods from avocado to beef. Why not try: cupcakes with coffee buttercream are easy to make Photo: Getty So next time you’re about to chuck the rest of your morning grounds down the sink, save them and try these tips and tricks for adding some extra life and depth to your dishes. Think stock, soup or stews An easy way to keep leftover brewed coffee is to pour it into an ice-cube tray and freeze for future use. That’s the advice from coffee aficionados Bialetti, inventors of the iconic stovetop coffee pot – think stock for soup or stews, or extra liquid for sauces and dressings. Left to linger Infusing the flavour of coffee is a great way of adding it to your cooking. Eric Snaith, head chef of Titchwell Manor, suggests gently heating vegetable oil with coffee beans added then leaving to infuse and cool before straining. He turns it into a coffee mayonnaise that’s served with a sweetcorn dish. Try a dollop of yours in a burger. ‘You can even infuse butter the same way and use it to make a coffee butter cream’, he adds. Mix it up Granger & Co serves an espresso & avocado frappé (£5, on its breakfast menu). It might seem like a strange combination but Granger says: ‘The avocado acts as an emulsifier and gives a decadent texture and richness, making it both satisfying and good for you.’ To make, blitz together the eight pitted dates, a cup of strong cooled coffee, half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a handful of ice cubes. Serve immediately. A hint of richness Coffee is also a great addition to braised dishes, giving richness and layers of flavour. Brewed or fresh grounds can be added to a pot roast, beef stew or even to a meaty ragu pasta dish. Just remember, less is more, the coffee should only enhance, not dominate. Coffee meets meat Adam Byatt of award-winning London restaurant Trinity recommends adding freshly ground coffee in very small quantities to a game casserole. ‘Literally a teaspoon for eight portions, it adds a depth and bitterness which can be delicious with sweeter meats such as wild duck and venison.’ Colourful dining Brilliant for adding colour too, freshly brewed coffee can be used to deglaze a roasting pan then turned into a delicious take on red-eye gravy, a traditional southern American sauce made from the drippings of pan-fried sausage, ham, bacon or other pork and mixed with black coffee. Marination madness Used in a marinade before grilling chicken, duck or even quail, the coffee gives a decadent dark, lacquered finish to the meat. Serve with tangy coffee barbecue sauce, a combination that gives a kick and yet balances well with the resident sweet and spicy notes and makes a great accompaniment to the meat. Secret ingredient ‘My personal favourite’, says head chef at Paradise by Way of Kensal Green, Cat Ashton, ‘is using ground coffee beans to create a beautiful spice mix for some roast pork or beef’. Try her Coffee Spiced Rub recipe and if using beans, warm them in a dry pan before grinding. Although they’re already roasted, the heat perks them up as it does other dry spices. Cat Ashton’s Coffee Spiced Rub • 3 tbsps coffee grounds • 1 tbsp smoked paprika • 1 tsp ground ginger • 1 tsp cayenne pepper • 1 tbsp ground black pepper • 1 tbsp sea salt • 4 cloves of garlic • 1 vanilla bean, seeds scraped out • 100ml olive oil Mix the garlic, spices and vanilla seeds together until you have a super-smooth paste then slowly incorporate 100mls of olive oil and rub the paste all over the meat. Ideally leave overnight for the flavours to really infuse before roasting.
