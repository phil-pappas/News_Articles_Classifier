That changed this week with the debut of Le George, a Mediterranean restaurant in one of the property’s ballrooms overlooking its marble courtyard. Le George is more laid-back than Le Cinq and serves light dishes meant for sharing. The Tuscan chef, Marco Garfagnini, uses no cream or butter in the French Riveria- and Italian-inspired plates like the salad of baby spinach shoots, red prawns and truffles; sea bream baked in a white wine sauce; and free-range, salt-crusted chicken. The French interior designer Pierre-Yves Rochon is behind the clean, cream-hued aesthetic, and Jeff Leatham, the hotel’s highly regarded floral director, is the artistic director.\nA CELEBRATION FOR MICHEL ROUX IN VIRGINIA\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
