Ford Presidential Museum will be closed until next summer as crews install new permanent interactive exhibits and conduct renovations.\nA ceremony is scheduled for Monday afternoon to place the final beam for the new DeVos Learning Center at the museum in Grand Rapids and to mark the museum's closure. The 8,000-square-foot DeVos Learning Center is set to be completed in fall 2016.\n\"Our hope is to teach our next generation of leaders the importance of leading with character and integrity, just as President Ford demonstrated with his leadership,\" said Red Cavaney, who served on Ford's White House staff and is chairman of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation.\nThe \"topping off ceremony\" follows three years of planning by the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation and Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library & Museum. More than $15 million was raised for projects including the Learning Center and exhibit updates.\nThe aim is \"to create conversations about the character and integrity of President and Mrs. Ford,\" the museum said in a statement. The project also includes digitalization of important papers at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, which is located in Ann Arbor.\nFord died in 2006, and former first lady Betty Ford died in 2011. They lived in Rancho Mirage, California, for decades. Their hometown was Grand Rapids, which Gerald Ford represented for years in the U.S. House.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:42:20.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
