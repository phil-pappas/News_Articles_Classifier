When Wales played host to Uruguay on Sunday at Millennium Stadium, RevPAR increased by 194.6% when compared with the same day in 2014. The absolute RevPAR of GBP88.42 was driven by a 35.6% increase in occupancy to 78.8% and a 117.2% rise in average daily rate to GBP112.18.\nGloucester reported RevPAR increases of more than 40.0% on both Saturday and Sunday. The market did not host a match on Sunday. RevPAR reached GBP83.73 for Saturday on the back of a 97.4% absolute occupancy level and a 44.5% increase in ADR to GBP86.00.\nBrighton hotels saw a minor dip in RevPAR on Friday (-1.2%) but reported increases of 23.4% and 62.5% on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Saturday’s absolute RevPAR of GBP150.05 was driven by a 24.7% increase in ADR to GBP159.99. On Sunday, RevPAR reached GBP51.64 thanks to a 28.2% increase in occupancy to 60.1% and a 26.8% rise in ADR to GBP85.99.\nLondon’s RevPAR growth was driven by ADR increases of more than 15.0% each day. Occupancy remained stable with the exception of a 12.3% increase to 79.3% on Sunday.

In total, the tournament is expected to result in more than 400,000 international visitors and 2.45 million tickets sold.\nSource: STR Global.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:53:29.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
