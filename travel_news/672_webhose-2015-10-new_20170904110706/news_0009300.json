The story goes that he couldn’t help noticing the invigorating effects the plant’s berries had on his goats, so he tried them himself. Or it was discovered by Omar, an exiled disciple of Sheik Abou'l Hasan Schadheli. Starving and alone, he tried to eat the bitter berries on a nearby shrub. Then he tried roasting them to improve the flavour. And when that didn’t work, he tried boiling them. Either way, as the scientist Mark Miodownik has remarked, it must have taken an extremely curious someone to figure out how to make the seed of the coffee berry palatable. All myths aside, the first proper story about the origins of coffee dates from around 1454 when the Mufti of Aden, Sheik Gemaleddin Abou Muhammad Bensaid, sent to Abyssinia for coffee when he was taken ill. Clearly, it made him feel better: coffee drinking caught on – lawyers, students and pretty much anyone in Aden who had to work or travel by night took to drinking coffee. It’s hardly surprising that such a stimulating beverage caught on fast. By 1510, the drink had made its way to Cairo. From there it travelled north, opening special houses for its consumption in Damascus and Aleppo, and, better yet, in Istanbul itself. London’s first coffee house was opened by Pasqua Rosée in 1652 As one might expect, this kind of popularity often provokes outrage from the powers that be. Bans followed hard on its footsteps, only for them to be overturned by Sultan Selim I himself. In 1524, the Grand Mufti Mehmet Ebussuud el-İmadi issued a fatwa permitting coffee consumption and, arguably, its fate was set. Turkish trade brought coffee to Venice; Turkish imperialism brought coffee through the Balkans to Vienna. And, as Venetian clergy condemned the drink as the “bitter invention of Satan”, even Pope Clement VIII was won over by its dark charms. Again, it’s hardly surprising: when London’s first coffee house opened (by Pasqua Rosée) in 1652 (two years after the nation’s first had opened in Oxford), merchants, lawyers and professionals of all stripes latched onto it and its imitators as an ideal place to meet and make deals. Coffee’s effects on them were far removed from the sleepiness or drunkenness of the pubs, the previously preferred locations. It is no accident that Lloyd’s of London, the Stock Exchange, and even Sotheby’s and Christie’s are said to have begun in coffee houses. Yet coffee was not the first commodity to circumnavigate the world so fast on the strength of its popularity. Chillies, chocolate, tomatoes and potatoes spring to mind. But it is one of the first where we can actually name some of those responsible for its proliferation. In 1616, Dutch merchant Pieter van der Broecke managed to procure coffee bushes from Yemen, bringing them back to Holland. Seedlings from these plants were planted by the Dutch in Sri Lanka in 1658, and fractionally later in Java, Indonesia, and Suriname, South America. In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam gave some seedlings from the same stock to King Louis XIV of France, who had acquired a taste for coffee from Soleiman Agha, the ambassador of the Sultan Mehmed IV. Just nine years later, Gabriel de Clieu managed to take seedlings from the Dutch plants to Martinique, bringing coffee growing to the Caribbean. Old England: the locals frequent a popular coffee shop in London 1820 In 1670, the sufi Baba Budan smuggled seven raw seeds out of Yemen on his return from the Hajj, bringing coffee cultivation to Chikmagalur in Karnataka, southern India. And between him and the Dutch, the Yemeni monopoly on coffee production was broken. Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki, the Polish hero of the Siege of Vienna in 1683, opened the city’s first coffee house, the Hof zur Blauen Flasche , using beans procured from the Turks. In 1727, Francisco de Melo Palheta allegedly flirted his way to the acquisition of coffee seeds, charming them from the wife of the governor of French Guiana, an act that eventually gave rise to Frank Sinatra’s 1946 hit, The Coffee Song (They’ve Got An Awful Lot Of Coffee In Brazil)… From here, demand continued to grow, aided in part by King George III’s ill-fated Tea Tax (which led both to the Boston Tea Party in 1773 and the contemporary inability to find a decent cup of tea in any café, dinner, restaurant or retail outlet in the United States). Coffee’s story is as rich as the drink itself. We live now in a world where, at any one time, we are closer to a freshly brewed cup than we are to a passing rat. So raise your mug to the Mufti of Aden, the man behind your morning cup of joe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:54:41.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
