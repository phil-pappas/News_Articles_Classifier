During his visit to China in September, George Osborne pledged £3 million to extend the Premier Skills programme and train more than 5,000 new officials. The programme, run by the British Council and the English Premier League, was set up to shape a new generation of Chinese players. The latest round of funding will allow it to be extended to rural areas for the first time. “Grass-roots football plays an instrumental role in British life and it’s brilliant to be able to spread that to China,” the Chancellor said on September 23 during a visit to the Soong Ching Ling Football School in north-western Urumqi. “This fantastic scheme, which will bring new opportunities to young people across China, will also help bring increased awareness and investment to Britain’s football sector.” The Premier Skills programme has been running since 2007 and was designed to inspire people around the world to get involved in football. So far, it has trained 1,100 coaches and reached almost 500,000 young people worldwide. “The main problem for Chinese football is the lack of young players, so we should focus on youth rather than elite football” Xu Jiayin, Evergrande Group chairman The Chancellor’s announcement followed an agreement between China and Britain to work together in developing sports education, including collaboration on policy, training for coaches and referees and a joint coaching badge. “Football has a long and proud history, bringing people across the world together. The success of the Premier League is partly because of overseas supporters, including Chinese fans,” Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said at the China- UK Football Development Forum in London in September. “Chinese football is going from strength to strength. The Chinese government has put major investment in the game and football has entered more primary schools. I believe China will become a formidable force in football, just as in other sports.” The forum, held at Capital City Academy, brought together representatives from both countries to share their experiences and ideas on the development of football. In attendance were Martin Glenn, chief executive of the Football Association; Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, and former Liverpool and England striker Michael Owen. China’s representatives included Li Tie and Fan Zhiyi, who were among the first Chinese players to play in Britain. “The main problem for Chinese football is the lack of young players, so we should focus on youth rather than elite football,” said Xu Jiayin, chairman of Evergrande Group, which owns Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao FC. Real estate tycoon Wang Jianlin agreed and said his company, Wanda Group, which runs youth development and campus sports projects, would like to co-operate with the Premier League to set up football schools across China. “Every Premier League club and many of those in the lower leagues have foundations and community arms that help engage young people and the community and use the power of football to strengthen social bonds,” said Mr Scudamore. “Every year, through the work of these foundations and arms, we involve 500,000 young people in football schemes and other programmes such as for health and education.” • Find more fascinating articles at China Daily • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:39:31.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
