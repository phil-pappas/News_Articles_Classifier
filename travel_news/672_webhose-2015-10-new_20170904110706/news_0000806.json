The amount you pay depends on your income – basic-rate income tax payers are liable for CGT at 18 per cent, those on higher rates of income tax pay 28 per cent. Capital gains below a set level, currently £11,100 per year, are tax-free. The most common ways to avoid CGT on investments are “tax wrappers” such as individual savings accounts (ISAs) or pensions, where gains are CGT-free. Investing in businesses qualifying for the Enterprise Investment Scheme is another avenue. If the shares have been held for at least three years they are CGT-free on disposal. What’s my capital gains liability? When you sell different types of asset or investment you may become liable to pay capital gains tax. Capital gains on shares: If you bought £20,000 of shares in a Quote: d company, which you did not hold in an Isa, and you subsequently sold them for £100,000, you would be liable for CGT. Your gain would be £80,000 minus your annual CGT allowance (£11,100), which comes to £68,900. Depending on your income tax status, you would pay either 18 or 20 per cent of this, so £12,402 or £19,292. Capital gains on a second home: CGT is also payable when you sell a property that is not your main home – eg, a buy-to-let or a holiday home. In this case, you pay tax on your gain but you can deduct certain expenses. Let us say you bought the property for £200,000 and sell it for £240,000. Your gain is £40,000, but you can deduct stamp duty, legal fees on purchase and sale, and estate agents’ fees. If those come to £6,500 in total, your taxable gain is £33,500. Take off your personal allowance of £11,100 and your taxable gain is £22,400. Depending on your income tax status, you would pay either 18 or 28 per cent: £4,032 or £6,272. Capital gains on a business: Selling all or part of a business that you own also incurs CGT. In this case, you will pay CGT on your gain – but if your shareholding is 5 per cent or more, you may be able to claim entrepreneur’s relief, which replaces normal CGT for everyone, so instead of paying at either 18 or 28 per cent, you pay 10 per cent instead. So if you sell your shareholding of more than 5 per cent for £2 million, making a gain of £1.7 million, you will pay CGT at 10 per cent on your gain less your personal allowance: £1,688,900. Total bill: £168,890. Capital gains on valuables: If you sell a valuable personal possession – except a car, which you will not pay CGT on – for £6,000 or more, CGT may apply. Items covered include jewellery, paintings, antiques, coins and stamps, and in these cases you will need to work out your gain on the item when you sell it and subtract your CGT allowance to see if any tax is payable. What you have to pay CGT on • Investments held outside a tax wrapper such as an Isa – this includes shares, bonds and other securities • Property in the UK that is not your main home – holiday homes, buy-to-let properties • Overseas property (if you are resident in the UK for tax purposes) • Property you inherit – the gain is counted as the difference between its value when you inherit it and when you sell • Businesses – but if you own 5 per cent or more of the shares in the company you may qualify for entrepreneur’s relief, which cuts your CGT rate to 10 per cent • Valuable personal possessions – items including jewellery, antiques, paintings, stamps and coins that are sold for more than £6,000 attract CGT How can the Enterprise Investment Scheme reduce your CGT and IHT bill? It is possible to defer your tax bill on capital gains by using the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and in some circumstances the tax liability can be removed altogether. There are two capital gains tax reliefs within the EIS: • Disposal relief, where shares in an EIS company are disposed of and certain criteria are met; • Deferral relief, which allows you to defer paying CGT on gains made in the past three years or during the current tax year – provided these gains are reinvested in a qualifying EIS investment. This defers the point at which the original CGT bill becomes payable and allows you to claim income tax relief at 30 per cent on the funds invested. All gains on EIS investments are free of income tax and CGT after a minimum holding period of three years. If the EIS investments are not sold but form part of your estate, any outstanding CGT liability lapses on death. • To find out more about private investment opportunities, visit Rockpool.uk.com Please note: your capital is at risk and there is no guarantee of return. Tax benefits depend on your personal circumstances and compliance with relevant rules.
