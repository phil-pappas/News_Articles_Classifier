Although Mehaffey, a rising star of Northern Ireland golf, proved the standout junior of the week after her staggering 16-shot victory, one of the biggest gaps in Junior Championship history, it was the boys’ event which provided the drama as Bath’s Li held on to win his first Telegraph title by one shot at the third – and final – time of asking. “It’s down to the moment when you feel the pressure but it feels great,” said Li. “I’ve finished my junior career on a real high and I’m extremely happy right now.” The England junior, with his parents also watching on once more, saw his overnight two-shot lead dwindle as he entered into an 18-hole battle of attrition with Stoke Park’s John Gough. The round had started badly enough for Li, who suffered a two-stroke penalty shot on the par three second when he practised and grounded his club from a water hazard. It meant a triple bogey six for Li and his lead wiped out in one hole. Gough, sure to be on an England programme in the near future, soon had a four-shot advantage, but Li fought back superbly on the back nine. He rifled consecutive irons to within two feet, landing four birdies in all to go down the 18th with a one-stroke advantage. But the wait on the final tee left Li in a quandary over club choice. He put his wood back in his bag and his subsequent iron was engulfed by Gough’s huge drive. Needing to better Li’s score to go into a play-off, Gough was then caught out by the sloping green and Li tapped home for an inward 32 and -5 under overall finish in front of a 100-strong gallery. “I wasn’t really thinking about that penalty,” admitted Li, who will head to Florida State University next year, but not before earning money at his father’s Chinese takeaway business near Bath. “I found it hard after that but after the worst moment it switched around pretty quickly to become the best moment of my career and the back nine was just so enjoyable for me. It was the best I’ve ever putted and this win feels great.\" With disappointment etched across his face, Gough, who putted brilliantly this week, said afterwards: “It was so up and down but Jamie deserved it”. Meanwhile, Wentworth’s Daniel List finished a gallant third at level par for the tournament. The Wellington College student also produced another magical moment when he chipped through the trees from woodchip on the 18th and saw his ball spin back to two feet. It came a day after his eagle two at the 12th. It was vastly different in the girls’ event, however. Mehaffey co-led after the first round with Eloise Healey, but stamped her authority in the final two rounds to finish six under par after a 69. Already this year Mehaffey has won the Scottish, Irish (for the third year running) and Welsh Open Amateur strokeplay titles over a stellar three-week period. If she had entered the English Amateur, an unprecedented quadruple might well have unfolded. Assured of winning LGU order of merit, the Royal County Down member has also gained full exemption to next year’s Ricoh Women’s British Open. Added to that, she will now tee up alongside Li at the BMW PGA Pro-Am thanks to her Telegraph win. Mehaffey has, though, stayed grounded. There are no immediate thoughts of turning professional and she will first follow in Graeme McDowell's footsteps by taking up a golf scholarship at Arizona State University. Mehaffey, who suffered an early round blip with a run of three bogeys, said: “Whatever lead you have, it feels like everyone is breathing down your neck. I was shaky after those bogeys but managed to relax and enjoy the back nine. “I looked at the honours board the other day and to win alongside the other girls is such an honour. It’s a great event and I’m really grateful to be a sponsors’ invite and win it. “It’s my last ever junior competition and I put my year down to the hard work over the winter.” Congratulations to @OliviaMehaffey @jamoe_ winning 2015 @TelegraphJunior @SkySportsGolf pic.twitter.com/MvHs297RWI — Katy Mathieson (@katygolf24) October 16, 2015 This 30th Championship saw an array of talent take to the North Course as the 21 finalists aimed to join the likes of Justin Rose, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Carly Booth and Melissa Reid. We saw the immense power-hitting of Billy Spooner, the Championship’s youngest ever competitor – 13-year-old Calvin Holmes – and the voracious talents of Barclay Brown. The latter, aged just 14, became the youngest winner of the Sheffield Open Amateur in July, beating Danny Willett’s success as a 16-year-old in 2004, and he backed up his form in Portugal by finishing seventh. The Telegraph Junior Championship contenders may seem to get younger, but this venerable tournament just continues to get better with age.
