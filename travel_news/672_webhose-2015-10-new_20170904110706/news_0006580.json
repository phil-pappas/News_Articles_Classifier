Fort Ross Harvest Festival celebrates native and Russian culture 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nRussian, Alaska Native and Native American history all come together at the Sonoma coast’s Fort Ross State Historic Park, and the park’s 5-year-old Harvest Festival is a tribute to the heritage of these diverse cultures. Orchards and vineyards first planted by Russian settlers in 1817 are the setting for tasting local heirloom fruit, cider, baked goods, cheeses and wines. Vintage horse and buggy rides, apple picking, Russian dances and songs, living history demonstrations and exploration of the restored fort compound unearth more history throughout the day. The optional four-course, locally sourced luncheon paired with wines from the Fort Ross-Seaview AVA typically sells out in advance. \nVitals: Oct. 17, 10 a.m.-5 p.m. $20; admission with wine tasting and other events $40-$125. 19005 Coast Highway One, Jenner. (707) 847-3437. www.fortross.org. \nSalinas’ turn to shine: The Monterey Peninsula doesn’t have a lock on the bounty of food and wine in the county, a fact amply demonstrated by the 5-year-old Salinas Valley Food & Wine Festival. The event also focuses on the regional culture and entertainment, as chef demos, wine tasting, a classic car show, a kids’ zone and vendors lining Main Street attract growing crowds to Old Town Salinas. Oct. 17, noon-5 p.m. $35-$55 advance, $45-$75 day of event. (831) 758-0725. www.salinasvalleyfoodandwine.com. \nTruckee River TLC: Fans of the Truckee River, Lake Tahoe’s only outlet and the source of a great swath of incomparable scenery, gather each year to minister to its water, meadows and wetlands by planting seedlings, pulling invasive plants, cleaning up garbage and performing other restoration tasks. The reward, besides a healthier river, is a celebration with live music, ample food, art projects, performances and other activities. Advance reservation is required. Oct. 18, 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Free. (530) 550-8760. www.truckeeriverwc.org. Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:08:35.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
