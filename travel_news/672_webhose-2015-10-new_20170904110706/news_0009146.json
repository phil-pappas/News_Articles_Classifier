I’d made coffee before – sloshing water into a cafetiere and even using an Italian moka pot on the hob. But this was different – espresso, as made by the cognoscenti, the followers of the one true bean. Two of the best speciality-coffee obsessives, editor of londonsbestcoffee.com , Derek Lamberton and his barista-trainer brother Mark were showing me the ropes. Our lesson started with the beans themselves. Derek scooped up a palmful from the hopper. ‘A skilled barista will look at the colour of the bean – how light or dark it is – as an indication of how the beans might taste,’ he said. ‘Coffee is a fruit, with natural acids, and depending how you roast those beans you can bring out those acids. Lighter roast tends to indicate you’ll get more acidity in the coffee. Darker roasting can develop the sweetness more, but take it too far and you will lose both acidity and sweetness. Black, oily beans tend to be less flavourful, and the qualities you do get will be bitter and ashy. They are essentially overcooked.’ Making an espresso or flat white at the level of a top-quality café is no easy task Next he pointed to the line along the flat side of the bean. ‘Washed’ beans, that have had the outer fruit removed with water before drying, have a line that shows white. In ‘natural’ or ‘dry-processed’ coffee beans, where the fruit dries on the bean and is removed afterwards, the line is the same colour as the bean. ‘It’s a generalisation, but “natural” coffees tend to be sweeter and fuller-bodied,’ Derek explained. What about shine? I asked, eyeing the rather dull beans in his hand. ‘You don’t want them to be too shiny. That indicates that in the roast the oil has cooked to the surface,’ Derek said. ‘The oil is where the flavour is, and as soon as it hits air it starts to oxidise. That’s why it’s best to use whole beans and grind them fresh. Any organic food goes stale faster if you cut it up, whether bread or coffee, so you’ll have lost a lot of flavour.’ When it comes to coffee, surprisingly there is such thing as too fresh, as Derek explained. ‘Beans give off carbon dioxide for at least two days after roasting – which is why bags of beans usually have a valve to let the gas out without letting oxygen in. If you took coffee the day after it was roasted and brewed it, it would taste gassy. The optimum time to use the beans is usually between one and three weeks after roasting.’ Tamping time: a fine grind is key to great flavour Photo: Alice Whitby After all this coffee talk, I was longing for a cup, so Mark introduced me to the espresso machine, which shoots pressurised water through ground coffee. The coffee drips out of a head – ‘a group’ – and the 'group handle’ or ‘portafilter’ is the paddle-shaped device that you see baristas using. Mark pushed the portafilter under the coffee grinder – a ‘burr’ grinder, which pushes the beans between revolving abrasive surfaces, like a pepper grinder. ‘This type gives a much more even, finer grind, making more flavour available,’ he said. Now to press down the coffee with a tamper, a heavy metal puck attached to a wooden handle. ‘The important thing is to press down levelly, so the water runs through slowly and evenly.’ I pushed the tamped portafilter into the group and popped the cup underneath. Thirty seconds later, a sweet-smelling espresso was steaming gently in the base. On top was the rich hazelnut ‘crema’, creamy foam. The optimum time to use the beans is usually between one and three weeks after roasting Now for the milk steaming. Mark wiped the steam spout and pressed a button to squirt out any water. Then he pushed the metal jug, half full of milk, up on to the spout. ‘Run it for a minute or so to heat it, being careful not to overdo it or the proteins curdle. Then lower the jug so the tip is on the surface. That’s what pulls the air in, creating a swirling motion to build a texture to the milk.’ After a few seconds of texturing, the milk was billowing with a layer of micro-foam, which leaves the milk tasting creamy and silky smooth. He tapped the jug firmly on the surface and swirled it ‘to keep the milk alive’ before pouring a perfect rippling heart-patterned flat white. Practice makes perfect: latte art in motion Photo: Alice Whitby Now it was my turn to try some latte art. ‘Pour from high up, circling around the cup. That gives you the brown background foam. Then come down low: that’ll give you the white foam,’ instructs Mark. I follow his directions ineptly, but yes – the foam was turning white as I lowered the jug. ‘Bring it to the edge closest to you. Now move towards the opposite lip… not too quickly. Tip the jug more steeply to make the heart swell.’ Despite the coaching, I’d made not so much a heart as a yelping labrador. But it tasted superb, almost chocolatey in its intensity, and deeply memorable. Making an espresso or flat white at the level of a top-quality café is no easy task. ‘But the more we practise, whether it’s pulling a perfect shot or pouring latte art, the more we appreciate the work of a skilled barista,’ Derek said. ‘It’s all about raising the standard of coffee – whether in a café or at home.’ Your barista at home For artisan coffee at home, the De’Longhi Eletta Cappuccino Top provides an unbeatable, fresh bean to cup experience.
