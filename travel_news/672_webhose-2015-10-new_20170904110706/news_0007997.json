According to the company, the app already has “over 10,000 app installs, serving over a million searches”. \n\nIn a statement, Flyzilla says it is looking to provide market transparency by excluding OTA inventories from its search results and focus exclusively on displaying direct airfares and promotions from airlines. \n\nThe metasearch engine also aggregates all time-limited flight deals and notifies users through push notification on the app, enabling them to snag a deal or promotion before it is too late. \n\nUse of the app and website are free, and the company has plans to extend coverage across the rest of South-east Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:45:59.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
