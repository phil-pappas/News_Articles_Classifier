There will be five additional scenes, with the majority of the illuminated tableaux being entirely new.\n“However several of the most popular displays; including the mythical Qilin, which are each made from over 65,000 glass phials filled with coloured liquid, the giant elephants and the safari park animals will also be returning,” he added.\nThe new Festival of Light will run alongside Longleat’s traditional Christmas celebrations which include the Santa Trains, Giant Musical Christmas Tree, Fairytale Characters and an outdoor Ice Skating Rink.\nThe Festival of Light at Longleat opens Fridays to Sundays from November 13th to December 6th and then daily from December 11th to January 3rd (excluding Christmas Day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:54:41.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
