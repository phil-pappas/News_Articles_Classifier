The newest addition to the thriving night scene of Abu Dhabi, the Lounge by Li Jiang brings together Pan Asian cuisine, creative beverage list and relaxed ambience enhanced by the venue’s open air setting. Resident DJ Margo Sahara sets the tone for the night with her signature beats.\nAn enticing new menu created by the Singaporean Chef Lee Zhi Zhong exclusively for the terrace, features signature Southeast Asian dishes such as otak wrap with kataifi and Macau sauce; savoury golden Chinese bun with minced chicken sauce; Vietnamese duck spring roll and soft-shell crab with Thai dressing, mango and chili.\nWith striking interiors by an award-winning Japanese designer Super Potato, Li Jiang resembles a traditional Asian market where an open kitchen is the hub of a busy and energetic environment of vibrant colours and Oriental aromas. The décor is characterized by the use of natural elements such as reclaimed wood, locally-sourced mud plaster and clear glass creating a neutral palette that acts as a background for the pops of colour.\nSituated on the scenic Grand Canal overlooking the majestic Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, the 57-acre waterfront luxury hotel offers a wide choice of luxury accommodation options including 85 private villas and four Ritz-Carlton Suites offering spacious facilities and premium amenities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:45:59.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
