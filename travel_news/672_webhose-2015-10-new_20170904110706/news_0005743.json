That precludes any mining inside indigenous territory, José Dualok Rojas added.\nHe also voiced the hope that the government would now be moved to pass the autonomy bill under pressure by the IACHR order for precautionary measures.\n“Now because of all the problems with Salitre, they are going to present this bill as a possible solution to the conflict,” José Dualok Rojas said.\nOther indigenous supporters are not as optimistic.\n“I very much doubt it,” said University of Costa Rica anthropologist Marcos Guevara, regarding passage of the autonomous bill. “As much as I would like to see it happen, there’s just too much opposition to it in the Legislative Assembly.”\nAnother source of pressure for its passage is a July 15 report by Gabriella Habtom, secretary of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, citing “the grave and persistent violation of indigenous people’s rights in Costa Rica.”\n“This report addresses the pattern of pervasive, long-standing and inter-connected violations or denials of the rights of indigenous peoples in the Republic of Costa Rica, and the ongoing situation of impunity in which they occur and persist,” Habtom wrote.\nThe current Indigenous Law, signed in 1977, gives indigenous communities dominion over indigenous reserves, but gives power over governance to the central government institutions such as the National Commission of Indigenous Affairs (CONAI) and the National Community Development Directorate (DINADECO).\nIndigenous leaders complain that both institutions defend more the interests of non-indigenous people than indigenous communities. Moreover, the indigenous complain that neither institution has done anything to recover land for indigenous communities within the 24 reserves, an estimated 60 percent of which is occupied by non-indigenous landholders.\nSome of the land is in the hands of “whites” who occupied it prior to 1977 when the Indigenous Law went into effect and who must be compensated if removed from the territory. But much of the land is in the hands on non-indigenous people who squatted on it after 1977 or illegally purchased it backed only by a bill of sale.\nIndigenous leaders blame the failure of the government to bring order in the past 38 years for the rise of an indigenous movement in Salitre to take back the land and confront non-indigenous “owners” who try to prevent them – sometimes violently – from retaking it.\nMatrilineal clans While the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found in favor of Bribrí and Teribe peoples, Herrera said the issue is more complicated than a conflict between indigenous and non-indigenous.\nThe Bribrí are divided into matrilineal clans, Herrera said, meaning that an individual’s identity within the community is determined by whether or not that person’s mother is Bribrí. Someone whose father is Bribrí and mother is Cabécar – a group closely related to the Bribrí – is considered Cabécar, not Bribrí.\nThe indigenous movement headed by Salitre Integral Indigenous Development Association President Sergio Rojas has attempted to reestablish a Bribrí social order in the community, and Rojas has been accused of intimidating indigenous individuals who are not “of clan.”\nRojas denies he has intimidated anyone and said that people of mixed heritage are welcome in the reserve – as long as they accept the decisions of the development association.\nSary Sosa, a Cabécar farmer, told the daily La Nación that she feels threatened by Rojas, even after multiple community meetings. She characterized the situation as a division between the “indigenous that go with Sergio Rojas and the indigenous who don’t go with Sergio Rojas.”\n“I don’t go with anything that he says,” Sosa said. “I don’t respect him as a leader. I don’t accept him, I don’t want him, I would even like them to take him out of the territory.”\nPolice intervene in an indigenous conflict in Salitre, in July 2014.\n(Courtesy of Public Security Ministry)\n‘Violence brings violence’ Last week DINADECO removed Rojas from the presidency of the development association alleging that he was barred from public service by a court order after serving seven months of preventive detention for alleged irregularities in the management of a government environmental services fund (FONAFIFO). Rojas said the charges were trumped up because of his advocacy in the Salitre controversy, which has seen multiple cases of violence directed at indigenous families.\nRojas told La Nación that the Bribrí would defend themselves from violence aimed at them if necessary. “Violence brings violence,” Rojas warned.\n“If the state doesn’t guarantee our security and our rights, we have to act as we have done; we have to find a way to guarantee our survival. And if violence occurs, it will be the fault of the state,” Rojas said.\nRojas’ supporters said the Bribrí leader has been the target of political persecution by the government, which is threatened by the emergence of a strong indigenous leader capable of starting a movement to reclaim indigenous land at the national level.\n“Because of the circumstances, he has taken a very strong position, and the violent actions aimed at [Sergio Rojas’ group] has caused him to make some mistakes,” said Donald Rojas, who is not related to the Bribrí brothers.\nDonald Rojas said a lively debate is underway within the Solís administration on whether or not to press forward with the Indigenous Autonomy Bill at the Legislative Assembly.\nAccording to Cinia Jiménez, of the Legislative Assembly’s Office of Citizen Participation, the Indigenous Autonomy Bill (No. 14,352) currently is 37th on the Assembly’s docket. That means it likely will not come up during the Assembly’s ordinary session that ends in November. The Solís administration, however, would have an opportunity to bring the bill before the Assembly in an extraordinary session that begins in December and lasts through April 2016.\nOne powerful voice against the indigenous autonomy issue is governing Citizen Action Party founder and lawmaker Ottón Solís. He wrote an opinion piece that appeared in the daily La Nación on Oct. 21, 2014 criticizing Sergio Rojas’ Salitre movement as collectivist and in conflict with Costa Rica’s Constitution.\nLawmaker Ottón Solís didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nDonald Rojas said a dose of racism also lies behind some of the opposition to the Indigenous Autonomy Bill.\nSaid Donald Rojas: “There are those who say that we should be made to live like white people, that we should modernize ourselves.”", "external_links": ["http://www.ilo.org/indigenous/Conventions/no169/lang--en/index.htm", "http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/publication/2015/07/cerd-report-final-eng.pdf", "http://www.nacion.com/opinion/foros/Salitre-bomba-tiempo_0_1446455344.html", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d252100.03769724182!2d-83.33350357750389!3d9.148775034809294!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x8fa6a10dede036f1%3A0x881a80235cc60b9e!2sSalitre!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1404762442426", "http://www.nacion.com/nacional/politica/Salitre-conflicto-etnico-tierras_0_1517648231.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:02:24.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
