SUPPLIED \nKiwis abroad caught on Google Street View \nSuddenly someone yelled: \"It's the Google car!\" \nThe group struck a range of poses as the Google car rolled past, and their efforts are now forever captured on Google maps, the beautiful mountains in the background (or at least until the car comes back in a few years). \n\"We had a split second to react. We knew we were about to be immortalised by Google,\" said Leuschke. supplied \nThe Google Street View car approaches. \nUnfortunately, those at the back of the group can't have heard the warning and appear surprised, and in some cases oblivious to the crucial moment. \n\"I'm just gutted I didn't strike a better pose,\" said Auckland builder Joe Hall. \nThe group had checked in on Google maps a number of times since their holiday, but there was no change on the original image. This week they discovered their fame had arrived. \n\"Yesterday I saw a funny car while I was having lunch, and I thought I have to check. And it was there,\" said Leuschke.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:56:40.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
