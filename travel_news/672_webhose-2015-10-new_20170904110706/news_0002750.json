In the past though it’s not been particularly cheap to secure a visa especially for multiple visits. This could be a game-changer for our hospitality industry.”\nAt the moment a 2 year visitor visa costs £324, but the cost will be reduced from next January to £85, the same as currently charged for a standard six month UK visitor visa.\nThe Government is also planning to reduce the cost of 10 year visas from £747 to £85, although no date has yet been set for this.\nOver 358,000 Chinese visitor applications were made in the year ending March 2015, and 96 per cent of these applications were successful and granted an entry visa to the UK.\nOn average they spend more than £2,700 on each trip.\nMs Ibrahim added: “This move by the government has huge potential and benefits for the hospitality industry in the UK. As a destination we’ve suffered over the years particularly with competition from Europe.\n“This will put us on a more equal footing and allow us to compete for Chinese visitors who love our heritage, history and hospitality. The BHA has worked hard and campaigned consistently for changes in the visa system and we’re really pleased the hard work has paid off.”\nHospitality chiefs from across the industry have chosen easing visa restrictions as one of their top three priority issues for the government to tackle alongside Cutting Tourism Vat and the lack of transparency for customers who use online travel agents. Industry representatives from hotels, restaurants and catering establishments lobbied members of Parliament on these issues at a recent Hospitality and Tourism Lobby Day at the House of Commons ahead of Government’s announcement on visas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:59:49.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
