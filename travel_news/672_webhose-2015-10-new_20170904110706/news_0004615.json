Part of that commitment is our long-standing support of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, which we highlight and celebrate each October.\nThis year, Delta’s annual “Breast Cancer One” employee survivor flight celebrated its 11th year with its first-ever international route, flying from New York City to Mexico City, kicking off our companywide breast cancer awareness campaign in partnership with BCRF. On Oct. 1, Delta’s iconic pink plane, which features an updated livery this year, carried more than 100 Delta employees and customers— women and men—who are breast cancer survivors or currently fighting the disease.\nAs Delta continues to focus on expansion in Latin America and the Caribbean, we are proud to showcase our commitment to a cure on a global scale. In addition to the survivor flight’s international route to Mexico, we also invited colleagues from our partner airline Aeroméxico on board, showcasing the international scope of the fight against breast cancer.\nHaving these new friends and supporters on board was a good reminder that no one fights alone. Breast cancer affects not only the victims, but also the loved ones who provide tremendous support and a shoulder to lean on throughout their journey.\nFor the second year in a row, customers also joined in the fight by participating in our “Unsung Hero” social media contest and SkyMiles Experiences online auction for the chance to be a part of this special day, with all of the winning miles going directly to BCRF.\nDelta employees across the globe are united in their passion and support for BCRF. To date, Delta employees, customers and their friends and families have raised more than $9 million for BCRF in the pursuit of eradicating breast cancer.\nThroughout the month of October, you will find our employees donning pink uniforms and raising funds for BCRF.\nEmployees raise awareness and donations, in Sky Clubs® and on board, through sales of Minute Maid pink lemonade and select pink items. Our support is truly a collective effort, as our more than 80,000 employees unite to raise funds for breast cancer research and generate awareness for the cause.\nSince we began our efforts, Delta employees and customers have raised funds to support 37 research projects, and Delta-donated funds support five BCRF researchers worldwide. But we are not done yet: We are proud of our long-standing partnership with BCRF, and with the help of our employees and customers, our hope is that we can continue to all work together toward finding a cure and creating a better tomorrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:32:40.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
