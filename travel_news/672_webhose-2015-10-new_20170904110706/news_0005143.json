There also will be a restaurant. \nDevelopers expect the attraction to open next summer at the site of the former Silver Fountain Inn, next to the Dixie Stampede along Missouri 76. \nOfficials say the project is among early efforts to revitalize Branson's popular strip of theaters and other attractions. The makeover also looks to make the corridor more accessible for pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as to bring in a trolley. \nPlanners hope that Missouri 76 ultimately becomes a \"linear amusement park\" filled with retail, restaurants and attractions that lure in pedestrians, said Ann McDowell, executive director of Project Branson, a private economic development group working with the city on the effort. \nOfficials say the corridor's revitalization plan is in its infancy and still being developed, though it is projected to cost $80 to $100 million. \nThink your friends should see this?
