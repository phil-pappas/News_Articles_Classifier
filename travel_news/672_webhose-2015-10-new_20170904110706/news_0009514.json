A company has come up with a calculator aimed at helping you beat the time zone difference. \nWeb-Blinds, a blackout blinds company, created the Jet Lag Calculator to help travellers. \nUsers input their departure airport and arrival airport, as well as the dates on which they will be travelling. \nThe calculator then sets up a schedule for users - consisting of when they should sleep, when they should seek light and when they should avoid light. \nThe calculator does not seem to have OR Tambo International Airport listed, but it has many other South African airports. \nWe spoke to Mike Richardson, Community Manager of Web-Blinds parent company Hillarys Blinds. \nHe said that the calculator uses is based on scientific theories. \n\"Beating jet lag means moving your body clock from the time at your departure point to the time at your destination point. To do this, you have to seek and avoid light at certain times of day,\" Richardson said. \n\"The Jet Lag Calculator uses a formula to tell you when to seek and avoid light in order to quickly and easily adjust your body clock to a different time zone.\" \n\"On your schedule, you'll see directions about when to seek and avoid light. Follow these steps and you'll move your body clock to your destination time and beat jet lag in no time\" \nHave a look at the Jet Lag Calculator below: Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:07:43.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
