These self portraits have become such an important part of a smartphone experience that manufacturers are trying to cash in on the fad as long as it lasts.\nMicromax Canvas Selfie is its second offering in the Canvas Selfie range. In fact Micromax has launched one more device called Canvas Selfie 3 with slightly better specs. While Canvas Selfie was a more costly device, Micromax is trying to cater to a larger audience with this one. So should you buy this device to click your next selfie? Read on to find out.\nWhat is good?\nI unboxed this device and jumped right into the camera app to click my selfie. The not-so-selfie obsessed guy like me actually ended up clicking many more selfies during the week long use. Both the cameras takes good pictures in adequate light. Since the pictures are 5 MP they are only good for sharing on social media. Performance is another cool aspect of this device. It didn’t lag or stutter during my week long test. Micromax is proving that the combination of 1 GB RAM and an octacore processor can offer a pretty solid performance package.\nWhat is not good?\nA good camera needs a very good viewfinder. On smartphones, the display is the viewfinder and the Micromax Canvas Selfie 2 has a terrible display. A big display with paltry resolution would mean smaller pixel density and lot of pixel jarring.\nWhen you try clicking pictures on this phone, it becomes irritating to compose the image. Even setting the display to maximum brightness doesn’t help. Micromax should have gone with a 720p display to make more sense of\nthe device.\nSoftware is another part where Micromax confuses the consumer. First there is an Android launcher and then there is something called FirstTouch simplified launcher. I switched to Android immediately after starting the device. It’s high time that Indian manufacturers either skinned Android with useful stuff or left it stock. The battery lasted not more than 8 hours of normal usage. This is too bad for any kind of usage.\nShould you buy?\nTo be brief, Canvas Selfie 2 is great at selfies, but it doesn’t pull off anything other than that. At this price, Karbonn Titanium has better super front camera and Micromax’s own Canvas Xpress 2 out performs peers.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n* Display: 5.0-inch LCD display\n* Resolutions: 480 x 854 screen resolution\n* Processor: Octa-core 1.3 GHz Mediatek MT6592 processor\n* Operating system: Android Kitkat OS\n* Memory & storage: 1 GB RAM, 8 GB storage (expandable up to 32 GB)\n* Camera: 5 MP rear camera + 5 MP front\n* Battery: Li-Ion 2000 mAh battery\n** Estimated street price: Rs 5,999\nFirst Published on October 08, 2015 12:05 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:30:23.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
