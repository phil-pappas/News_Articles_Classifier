The technology of solar power has been put forward for over a decade. In recent years, it has come a long way. The progresses covers the efficiency of conversion, the trapping technology and the cost of setting up. the solar panel need not the large room for motor, so the application of solar panel on FOSJOAS electric self-balancing scooter will scale down the volume and weight of FOSJOAS scooter. China, 5 October 2015 -- FOSJOAS electric self-balancing scooter was unveiled in the year of 2010. On its advent of FOSJOAS intelligent self-balancing scooter, all walks of life were concerned it for the reason of its eco-friendly and recreational nature. The community and some environmental organisation thought highly of FOSJOAS intelligent self-balancing scooter. FOSJOAS scooter serves to decrease the emission of exhaust, relieve the pressure of traffic jam and protect the quality of air.These contributions made by FOSJOAS intelligent self-balancing scooter mainly comes from the eco-friendly nature of FOSJOAS electric self-balancing scooter, for FOSJOAS electric scooter is powered by electricity. Electricity power is quite a clean energy. It is widely used in modern society. There is a sign that shows electricity power is going to expand its application to the realm of transportation, which is evidenced by the electricity-assisted scooter. The electricity-assisted scooter is fairly familiar to the public. In respect of application of electricity power, FOSJOAS intelligent self-balancing scooter models itself on the electricity-assisted scooter. This wise move also poses an issue that the application of electricity power calls for a large room for battery motor. Whatâ€™s worse, the battery core holds the possibility to pollute the soil and water. Therefore, another renowned and clean energy is much needed. The solar power is highly likely to become the most promising candidate.The technology of solar power has been put forward for over a decade. In recent years, it has come a long way. The progresses covers the efficiency of conversion, the trapping technology and the cost of setting up. By erecting the solar panel in the open air, the solar power will be trapped in the sunlight. The subsequent charge is free good and proper. The charge via electricity power costs a little though it is cheaper than auto. At the same time, the solar panel need not the large room for motor, so the application of solar panel on FOSJOAS electric self-balancing scooter will scale down the volume and weight of FOSJOAS scooter. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:44:49.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
