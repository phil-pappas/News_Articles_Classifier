Glasses fell off the bar by themselves overnight, and a strong smell of cigarette smoke mysteriously emanated from Bergin's favorite booth. Tom Bergin’s Public House Fullscreen Four overnight cleaning employees have even quit after claiming to have seen an old man smoking on the couch. Tom Bergin’s Public House Restless spirits, ghosts of soldiers and prisoners who haunt their former cells — it may sound like a ghost story, but many people truly believe the tales. You might believe them too after a trip to one of the these haunted places in America. From historic bars to cemeteries, theatres and tunnels, these are some of the spookiest spots you can visit in the country.\nMcGillin's Olde Ale House - Philadelphia, Pa.\nMcGillin's Olde Ale House, the oldest continuously operating tavern in Philadelphia, serves up a different kind of spirits than you'd normally find at most watering holes. According to investigators from South Jersey Paranomal Research, a non-profit organization that investigates ghost sightings, the 155-year-old bar is haunted by a lady in white. During an overnight investigation, she was spotted in the mirror above the fireplace. Skeptical? Not only is there a photo, but multiple people have reported objects moving on their own mysteriously and strange noises. Rumor has it that the ghost is the spirit of Ma McGillin, who died 70 years ago after running the bar and raising 15 children upstairs from it over the years. While perhaps those sightings are just the result of someone having a few too many drinks, the only way you'll know is to pull up a stool, order one of the numerous regional beers on tap and keep your eyes glued to the mirror for the lady in white.\nThe Weems–Botts Museum - Dumfries, Va.\nIn Dumfries, Virginia's oldest chartered town, the ghosts of Civil War soldiers and a mysterious little girl haunt the former home of Parson Weems, George Washington's biographer. Today the house has been repurposed as the Weems-Botts Museum, highlighting the history of the revolutionary war and colonial times in Virginia. But in 1974, people began to notice strange occurrences in the museum and ghost hunting enthusiasts now refer to it as one of the most haunted sites in the state. The place has even been featured on A&E Entertainment's My Ghost Story and CBS Radio's Spirited History . Plan a visit in October, and the museum offers ghost tours and haunted lock-ins that will give you a historical dose of spooky.\nFox Theatre - Atlanta, Ga.\nOne of Atlanta's greatest landmarks, the Fox Theatre is worth a visit thanks to its ornate interior complete with a 2,000 pound chandelier. But your tour guide might mention that the historic venue is quite possibly haunted. Over the years, employees have reported numerous strange happenings: doors slamming, toilets flushing, footsteps and cigar odors when no one is there. Several years ago, paranormal investigators visited the Fox and captured a recording of a dog barking and a photo of a figure sitting in the seats. Employees, concerned that the ghosts might curse the theater or sabotage a production, keep them at bay by leaving a light on stage even when it's closed, providing an opportunity for the spirits to perform.\nSt. Louis Cemetery No. 1 - New Orleans, La.\nThe city of New Orleans itself is a flurry of paranormal activity, but its cemeteries are some of the most haunted places in the region. Some have fallen into disrepair or aren't open to tourists, but there are a few worth checking out for ghost enthusiasts. Since New Orleans is below sea level, locals typically bury their dead above ground in \"Cities of the Dead.\" Visitors have reported hearing screams or bodies moving around inside the tombs, as well as sightings of the ghosts of cats and dogs. The most famous haunted cemetery in New Orleans is St. Louis Cemetery No. 1, which holds the remains of some of the participants of the battle of New Orleans and the first black mayor of the city, Ernest N. \"Dutch\" Morial. But the most fascinating tomb is that of Marie Laveau, aka the Voodoo Queen. People have reported her spirit walking between the tombs wearing a red and white turban and mumbling curses to trespassers. Many voodoo believers and tourists visit Laveau to leave offerings in the hope of being blessed by her supernatural powers. Legend says that if you go, knock three times on the face of her grave, mark three X's, knock three times again and then make your wish.\nPioneer Square - Seattle, Wash.\nSeattle's most historic neighborhood, Pioneer Square, is filled with tales of haunted happenings. To get the scoop on local ghosts, book a tour with Spooked in Seattle , which was founded by ghost hunter Ross Allison in 2004. The company's 90-minute late night tours, led by real ghost hunters, recount stories of murder, suicide and unfortunate deaths. Spooked in Seattle also offers a tour of the area's most haunted bars, where you'll hear tales of the city's sex scandals, murders and lingering ghosts.

However, there's something fishy about the place — and it's not anything to do with the ocean. Foghorns blow on clear days, boats mysteriously come untied and strange noises and whispers have been heard inside. According to local legend, these are all the doing of Ernie, a former keeper of the lighthouse. His younger wife ran away with the Block Island Ferry captain. Ernie was so distraught that he allegedly climbed to the roof of the lighthouse and jumped. While his body was never found, many people believe his spirit lives on at the lighthouse.\nSilver Run Tunnel - North Bend Trail, W.V.\nThe scenic North Bend Rail Trail in West Virginia stretches 72 miles from I-7 in Wood County to Wolf Summit in Harrison County. Popular with hikers, bicyclists and horseback riders, the now-abandoned rail trail is known for its tunnels and bridges. But there's one tunnel in particular that can cause even the bravest adventurers to proceed with caution: Tunnel No. 19, also known as the Silver Run Tunnel. In the early 1900s, multiple train engineers reported seeing a beautiful woman in a long, flowing dress standing on the tracks. But when they stopped to investigate, bringing the trains to a screeching halt, she was always nowhere to be found. The only clues as to her identity were some bones discovered nearby. Visitors still report seeing the woman occasionally today, but if you want the best chance of hunting her down, bring a flashlight: the curved, damp tunnel is 1,376 feet long and the interior is beyond sunlight's reach.\nOhio State Reformatory / Bissman Building - Mansfield, Ohio\nFor a truly hair-raising experience, paranormal activity enthusiasts can stay overnight at the Ohio State Reformatory and participate in private overnight ghost hunts, where they're free to investigate independently until 5:00 a.m. The reformatory, located roughly halfway between Columbus and Cleveland off I-71, served as the backdrop for the classic movie Shawshank Redemption . During its 94 years as a working prison, 154,000 inmates passed through the Ohio State Reformatory, many of them never leaving thanks to disease, influenza, violence and suicide.\nGhost walks and private investigations are also offered in the nearby Bissman Building (known as the Brewer Hotel in the movie), which served as a wholesale grocery distribution center until the mid 1970s. The building, known for its eerie facade, was constructed by the same contractors as the Ohio State Reformatory and embodies the same Gothic Romantic styling. Both places have been featured on shows like SyFy's Ghost Hunters and Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures .\nTom Bergin's - Los Angeles, Calif.\nOne of the oldest Irish pubs in Los Angeles, the eponymous Tom Bergin's was opened by its original owner in 1936. The ultimate host, Bergin was known for chatting up guests, including celebrities like John Wayne and Cary Grant, while enjoying a cigarette from his favorite corner booth. After his passing, the bar's staff reported weird things happening. Glasses fell off the bar by themselves overnight, and a strong smell of cigarette smoke mysteriously emanated from Bergin's favorite booth. Four overnight cleaning employees have even quit after claiming to have seen an old man smoking on the couch. After many years in business, Tom Bergin's closed its doors in July 2013. However, a patron who couldn't bear the idea of his favorite bar closing forever ended up purchasing the establishment and reopening it a few months later.\nDrury Plaza Hotel - Santa Fe, N.M.\nLocated in the heart of Santa Fe, the building of the Drury Plaza Hotel and its restaurant, Eloisa, was once home to the St. Vincent's Hospital. Many guests believe that the building is haunted by ghosts of its past, reporting things like crying babies and the sound of someone running down the hallway. Room 311 is said to be haunted by the ghost of a baby who lived there in critical condition after a car crash and then died. But the building's supernatural activity might date back to even before the hospital, since it's rumored that nurses also reported hearing disembodied voices in the basement, loud banging noises and the feeling of being touched by unseen hands. Some locals believe the noises are coming from restless Native American spirits from a Pueblo revolt that destroyed a church on the site 400 years ago.\n15 CONNECT 63 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE
