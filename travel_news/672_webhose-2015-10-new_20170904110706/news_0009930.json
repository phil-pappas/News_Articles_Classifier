That fire burned the lighthouse keeper's house to the ground. Advertisement \nSeattle architect Gene Grulich will prepare a detailed historical structure report on the condition and rehabilitation needs of the 95-foot-tall reinforced concrete structure. \nRehabilitation is the first priority, but the lighthouse society says it hopes to see the lighthouse opened to public visitors at some time. \nNow the lighthouse is closed except for special guided tours, like Monday's tour, when a small group of media and dignitaries squeezed up the spiral staircase leading to the small lantern room overlooking San Francisco Bay. \nWalking the 123 steep, narrow stairs to the top can leave visitors a little queasy. The views, however, of ships, bridges, pelicans, San Francisco skyscrapers and the vast expanse of blue bay waters are breathtaking. \nProviding public access to such a cramped part of the popular park would be a challenge, but the National Park Service is willing to look at options, said Marcus Koenen, the Alcatraz site supervisor with the park service. \n\"We're discussing it,\" he said. \"The tight space is the challenge. Look, we have 5,000 people coming to the island just today.\" \nLands' End is footing the bill for the architectural study. The lighthouse at Alcatraz Island is the subject of an effort to raise the money needed to renovate it. The National Parks Service, US Coast Guard, United States Lighthouse Society and Lands√¢ End are all teaming up to help save the historic Alcatraz lighthouse, the oldest lighthouse on the west coast that is in need of great repair. (Karl Mondon/Bay Area News Group) \n\"We want to save the beacon and make sure it is safe and available for future generations,\" said Federica Marchionni, Lands' End chief executive officer. \"This is the oldest lighthouse in California. It is the most iconic lighthouse.\" \nLands' End, she said, was founded by Gary Comer, a sailor and world traveler who appreciated how lighthouses captured people's imagination as a symbol of safe harbor. \nThe light from the Alcatraz lighthouse flashes every five seconds and can be seen 20 nautical miles away. \nDespite modern ship navigators' reliance on GPS and other technology, the automated lighthouse beam from Alcatraz is an important aid to mariners, said Coast Guard Capt. Bill Drelling. \n\"There is no substitute for a visual marker,\" Drelling said, \"especially on a foggy day.\" Contact Denis Cuff at 925-943-8267. Follow him at Twitter.com/deniscuff .
