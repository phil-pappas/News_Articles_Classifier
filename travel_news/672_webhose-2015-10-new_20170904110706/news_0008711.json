The hangar has also been equipped with an advanced aircraft docking system which can be customised to serve different types of aircraft. \nThe addition of the new hangar effectively increases the area dedicated to painting facilities at Etihad Airways Engineering by 150 per cent, from 4,000 sqm to 10,000 sqm. \nThe paint hangar also incorporates a large-format decal production facility which will be used to repaint and rebrand Etihad Airways’ entire fleet of 120 aircraft with its ‘Facets of Abu Dhabi’ livery and branding over the coming months. Aircraft belonging to Etihad Airways’ partners and other airline customers also undergo repainting and maintenance operations at the Etihad Airways Engineering facility. \nJeff Wilkinson, Senior Vice President Technical, Etihad Airways, said: “We have significantly increased our aircraft painting capacity with the introduction of a new paint hangar as we continue to expand our MRO capability on new aircraft platforms. \n“The team at Etihad Airways Engineering has the experience, expertise and equipment to undertake all kinds of heavy maintenance and aircraft painting for Etihad Airways, its equity partners and third party customers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:49:06.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
