(Photo: Larry Olmsted for USA TODAY) \nThe scene: “Homey” is the best word to describe Billy Gail’s Café, a former gas station and log cabin that was transformed about 20 years ago into the most beloved breakfast spot in the heavily touristic Branson region. But while most of the Branson restaurants, attractions and live entertainment are on bustling Route 76, Billy Gail’s is just a bit hidden on smaller Route 265. It sits less than half a mile off the main drag — just far enough so that if you didn’t know it was there you would never find it. But all the locals find it, and it is annually voted Best Breakfast in the region. It is rustic enough to lack its own website, but consistently earns four-plus stars from Yelp and TripAdvisor with mostly glowing reviews — and tons of votes, more than a thousand on TripAdvisor alone. \nBilly Gail’s is the quintessential “country” eatery, set in various rooms of an old log cabin that is also an antique store-cum-flea market, with many of the furnishings for sale. It is decorated with antiques, bird houses, rocking chairs, tchotchkes and the like, while ceiling fans spin overhead. Coffee is served in mismatched novelty cups, the wood floors are well-worn, the tables covered with red checkered cloths, and the whole thing has the feel of eating in a general store in someone’s house, which it pretty much is. The old gas pumps are still outside, but decommissioned and painted with hippie-style flowers and smiley faces. Servers exude Southern charm, call you “hon,” and accept only cash for payment. It is open solely for breakfast and lunch, and is a far and refreshing cry from the numerous chain restaurants and fast food outlets in the heart of Branson. USA TODAY Nashville star: Southern breakfast at Puckett’s \nReason to visit: Hubcap pancakes and French cakes. \nThe food: Billy Gail’s is known for breakfast, and most famously for its enormous fourteen-inch-across “hubcap pancakes,” which overflow all sides of the plate, hanging down almost to the table. But all the food here could fairly be described as hearty. The pancakes are actually lighter than they look, thin, doughy and almost crepe-like, with a very light consistency. But they get weighed down by the assorted extras offered within: blueberries, peanut butter, chocolate chips, pecans, all kinds of things in generous quantities. Even bacon is offered as a pancake addition, which is unusual, and they don’t skimp, with a mix of smaller chunks and sections of strips two inches long. The pancakes are big enough that the single order is enough for most people, especially with a side or pastry, but stacks of two and even three are available — and enormous. \nOne interesting signature dish is the “French cake,” a combination French toast and pancake, which involves taking Billy Gail’s standard pancake, dipping it in egg batter, and cooking it on the griddle. It doesn’t end up with as crispy an exterior crust as regular French toast, but rather tastes more like a typical batter pancake, a bit thicker, heavier and less fluffy. These can also contain toppings of your choice. They also offer a very good regular French toast, using thick-cut Texas toast. USA TODAY Unique regional food: Springfield cashew chicken \nIn keeping with the large portions, four-egg omelets are popular here, with a wide range of options, but other than their impressive size, they are pretty basic. If you want to move beyond the pancakes, French cakes and French toast, the best bet is probably the large and delicious South of the Border breakfast burrito. It is a tortilla stuffed with two eggs, a mix of red and green peppers, onions, and your choice of meats, bacon, sausage or ham, then topped with plenty of cheese and salsa. Another great choice is the sloppy biscuit, which basically combines a breakfast sandwich and that Southern specialty, biscuits and sausage gravy, by dousing a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit in rich gravy. Come hungry. \nAs for side dishes, the hash browns are just so-so but he grits are very good, and that’s the way to go for starch. The ham is the standout among meats, fresh and thickly cut. There is a full array of diner-style breakfast combos with eggs, meats, sides and toast, plus breakfast sandwiches and even steak and eggs. If you love breakfast — and who doesn’t? — it’s really hard to go wrong here, but the pancakes are definitely the differentiator. They also serve lunch dishes such as burgers, soups, fish and chips, and the regional specialty, a fried pork tenderloin sandwich. But Billy Gail’s Café is justifiably renowned for its breakfast, and so popular with both locals and the many return guests who frequent Branson for its variety of musical shows that it can get quite crowded here, especially on weekends, and the wait for a table can reach an hour.
