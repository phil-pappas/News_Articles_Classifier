A former car in their luxury fleet has been turned into a mobile advertisement with a unique car wrap that allows others on the road an x-ray vision view of what goes on inside a high-end transportation vehicle. On one side, a businessman relaxes with a newspaper that touts the \"Ride Responsibly\" campaign. On the other side, a customer works on his laptop as he rides comfortably in the backseat of a well-appointed luxury vehicle.\nThe Ride Responsibly campaign is an initiative established by the National Limousine Association to enlighten and inform the public at large, in an effort to ensure safer ground transportation. The campaign is working to bridge an industry-wide gap between the rights of passengers and the responsibility of the service providers. In an era of app-based, fast and cheap ride sharing options, the NLA wants customers to know what their safest options are and risks associated with unknown providers and cars.\nSuperior Executive Transportation owner, Paul Walsh , understands that modern customers want the ability to book their transportation online and through their mobile devices, which is why he has also created a mobile app for his clients to set up rides with SET. This is especially convenient for repeat customers who use his service regularly – either for their business or personal needs. It gives customers the ease of other mobile apps, but with the safety, experience and quality of a luxury car service.\nAbout Superior Executive Transportation:\nSuperior Executive Transportation is in their 11 th year of business and has provided safe, comfortable, luxury transportation for over 2,000 customers, including families traveling to and from the outer banks or Hampton Roads resort areas, individuals wanting safe transportation to and from local events, and traveling executives in the financial, government contracting, legal and public sectors, among others. Walsh notes that his clients are not always traveling or even going long distances, but that having a driver allows them to complete transactions, get work done, complete team activities and relax. Sedans and larger SUVs models are available depending on the clients' needs and all SET vehicles are new, luxury models.
