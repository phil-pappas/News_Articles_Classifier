With 1,305 murders in 2014 — the last statistics available — Rio de Janeiro is one of the most violent cities in the country.\nAccording to Brazilian weekly Isto E, two agents are already in the city, which next August will host South America’s first Olympic Games.\n“I can confirm that the DEA has opened an office in Rio. It is located at the U.S. consulate general,” DEA spokesman Matt Barden told AFP in Washington.\nBarden said the DEA had long been active in Brazil but that the new office would increase its effectiveness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:54:40.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
