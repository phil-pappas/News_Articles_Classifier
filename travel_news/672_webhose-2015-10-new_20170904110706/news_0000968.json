And with winding roads overlooking the Atlantic, secluded lighthouses, and charming cities up and down the coast, it’s a gem best experienced by car.

Start by the harbor on Commercial Street and work your way up Exchange Street, which is lined with boutiques selling everything from clothes and jewelry to locally crafted pottery and fudge.
