But there are lesser-known islands whose virtues are perhaps unsung. These essays feature three such islands, celebrating the homespun Carnival in Dominica, the local legend of the mermen of Tobago and the old-soul goats in Anguilla that have ruled the craggy land for centuries.\nFlying into Tobago in July, I looked down on a wide swath of yellow seaweed rippling in the tideline. Sargassum. From the sky, its gentle, drifting movements belied the invasive algae’s destructive power.\nWithin days, many of the island’s beaches would lie hidden under this otherworldly blanket, one that would prove detrimental to fishermen. Up north, nets snagged and tangled, pulling in hauls of seaweed and not much else. The fishermen’s distress was palpable and it was not hard to imagine the lure of folklore in such dire circumstances, not difficult to imagine an invocation of the benevolent mermen of local legend.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Goats Rule on the Island of Anguilla OCT. 9, 2015 On Dominica, a Carnival Celebration as It Was Meant to Be OCT. 9, 2015 When I ask the elders here about mermen, some nod their heads knowingly. Up north, they say, that’s where they came from. From the deep waters off the villages of Speyside and Charlotteville, where the Caribbean meets the Atlantic Ocean. They come seeking the fairy maids who are thought to inhabit the island’s rivers and waterfalls.\nPerhaps it is useful to clarify that there are no mermaids in Tobago folklore. The mermen come solo, seeking lovers not of their tribe. Where the merman has a flashy, fishy, iridescent tail to propel him through his oceanic world, his river-bound maiden is said to conceal one perfect foot and one tiny hoof, not unlike that seen on a deer. Once united, rumor has it, they mate behind hidden waterfalls, far from prying eyes.\nThe mermen are said to be handsome, with flowing hair, wearing the luxurious formal wear of centuries past, and are reputed to grant favors to mortals, changing financial fortunes, bestowing musical skills and the gift of genius. When I ask elders how the mermen get to the fairy maidens, they shake their heads. Magic. It is thick on the ground. I want to believe they exist.\nThere is a sweet incongruity to the folkloric presence of these water lovers that may be explained, in part, by the fact that Tobago was turnstiled between the Dutch, English, Spanish, Swedish, French and other colonial powers before being made a ward of Trinidad in 1889. Undoubtedly each passing colonial power introduced an element of folklore, which would have been absorbed into the culture.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Figures such as jumbies (ghosts), old hags (malevolent spirits said to covet children) and jabless (La Diablesse, the devil-woman whose shape-shifting shenanigans have made her one of the most feared of the folkloric tribe) are among the many characters immortalized in the literature and drama of the Caribbean region. However, the lovely, gentle myth of the fairy maids and kingly mermen, decked out in their swashbuckling moldy splendor, appears unique to Tobago.\nWhile it is difficult to pin down a sighting of a merman, a 19th-century fairy maid who chased a doctor is entrenched in the island’s oral history. Late one night a doctor was hurrying to attend to a cholera patient when he saw a woman bathing a young child in a pool of water. Upon chastising her for exposing her child to the cold, wet elements at such a late hour, he was horrified when she leapt up and gave chase with supernatural speed down a coastal path. The winding road, even in daylight, was precarious with dramatic cliff-plunges. Legend has it that the doctor was able to escape only by turning a corner. Fairy maids, whatever their other talents, cannot turn corners. In relaying his tale to the watchman at the next estate, he learned she was well known to all.\nI am not a Tobagonian. I am Trinidadian. My family has lived in Trinidad for over 200 years. But there is a secret yearning for Tobago and her magic. Tobago is an island I feel I know well. In the 1950s, my grandparents bought land in Tobago. The spot, which remains in our family, is still there, overlooking the Scarborough harbor.\nMy earliest memories are colored by Tobago’s particular light and smell. The flamboyant trees are spectacular, their fiery blooms lining the road to Scarborough, the island’s capital. It may have been my grandfather who first told me the story of the mermen coming to visit their fairy maids.\nWhile Trinidad shares nationhood with Tobago, I am reminded that this jewel of an island clearly is her own land. And when I doubt her, I listen for movement behind thick trunks, skitters of a small hoof, snippets of a song. I imagine I will build a house high on a bluff overlooking the water and spend my days scouring the horizon for mermen with their beautiful scaled tails. And perhaps, in another time of sargassum days and nights, I might just see them.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/travel/11CaribbeanAnguilla/11CaribbeanAnguilla-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/travel/11Caribbean-Dominica-1/11Caribbean-Dominica-1-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:06:48.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
