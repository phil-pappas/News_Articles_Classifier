(Watch above.) \n\"It was a great ending to our outrigger canoe practice for sure,\" he told HuffPost B.C. in an email. \nThe sighting was one of many in Vancouver over the weekend. 2 of 3. A big thank-you to the guy on the bike who told us about the \"whale at English Bay.\" #greywhale #Vancouver pic.twitter.com/pa0giDsVdW \n— Duncan Minett (@dunkster2112) October 5, 2015 @PacificWhale Another pic of the Grey Whale in #Vancouver yesterday pic.twitter.com/E8COYEO124 \n— John E (@jerhardt) September 30, 2015 \nLast week, at least one person was compelled to get an even closer look by jumping in the water, prompting the Vancouver Aquarium to issue a public warning on Facebook. \n\"Your actions could disrupt natural behaviours such as socializing, resting, and – in this instance – feeding,\" said the post on Friday. \"It’s not just about keeping the whale comfortable and safe, but about doing the same for you.\" \nIt may look tempting, but don’t even think about it. Swimming towards any whale, like this grey whale, is a bad idea... Giant Pacific Octopus Hugs Diver In B.C. of   Canadian biologist Jackie Hildering is using some amazing photos of an encounter between her scuba diving partner, Natasha Dickinson, and a giant octopus to shed light on the sea monster mythology. The inquisitive octopus covered DIckinson's entire face, but neither was in discomfort, said Hildering. Dickinson put her hand over the regulator in her mouth as a precaution, but allowed the curious octopus to explore around her. The octopus also took an interest in a clasp at the end of a bungee cord on Dickinson's gear. NEXT: Seal Tangles With Octopus In Victoria, B.C.
