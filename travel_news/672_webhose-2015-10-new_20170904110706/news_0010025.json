Though the style has been produced for quite some time, the “orange” description was purportedly coined in 2004 by a U.K.-based wine importer who encountered a bottle in winemaker Frank Cornelissen’s cellar in Sicily. It refers to certain white wines (yes, they’re made from white grapes) that fall somewhere on the color spectrum of fall foliage. Their flavors also have great autumnal appeal, since many can be downright and broodingly earthy. Orange wine has become somewhat of a derogatory term amongst sommeliers, and some restaurants have taken to listing them as amber , which is a more accurate description of color in many cases. “I prefer skin-fermented ,” says Master Sommelier Pascaline Lepeltier of NYC’s soon-to-reopen Rouge Tomate, referring to the method by which the wine is made: fermented on the skins, or “macerated,” the same way a red wine obtains its color and texture.\nThink of the wine like tea, with maceration akin to steeping. The longer it macerates, the more character, depth of color, tannins, and bitterness is extracted. It’s the way whites were made in ancient times, before the advent of stainless steel tanks, pumps, and filtration systems. Some producers today are even producing orange wines in clay vessels called amphorae , which are dug into the ground to protect the wine from oxidation, light, and temperature fluctuations.\nSure, orange wines can be challenging for those not used to so much texture in their whites, and some may seem like hippie wines: made in strangely rustic ways, showing their bumps, bruises, and the signature of the winemakers who loved them. But the best examples prove that skin contact can amplify flavors where conventional white winemaking would distill them down to their essence. They’re great if you’re in a bind for something to pair with funkier fare—like sweetbreads, chicken liver mousse, or game birds—as well as with the autumnal bounty of your fall dinner table.\nIt’s a tradition that is still very much alive in Eastern Europe, like in Georgia, where Lepeltier recently traveled to study up on the technique, and has slowly but surely migrated west and even into the New World, with several prominent wineries in California now practicing skin-fermentation.\nHere are seven skin-fermented wines to try this fall:\n2013 Iago’s Wine Chinuri\nKartli Republic of Georgia; $19\nIago Bitarishvili founded his winery in 2003 to realize his dream of making wine in the traditional homespun way of his region. So he crushes his organically grown chinuri grapes in a large, hollowed-out log and empties the resulting juice and skins into earthenware vessels called qvevri, which then remain buried in the ground for six months. It may sound like alchemy, but the result is a fascinating mouthful: pear, autumn honey, buckwheat, and eastern spices, with the structure of a red wine built for aging. Try it with hard cheeses and charcuterie or more substantial vegetarian fare like bitter greens and eggplant.\nFor information: wine-searcher.com\n2011 Kabaj Rebula\nGoriška Brda, Slovenia; $24\nSince very little has been written on the ancient methods, Kabaj’s winemaker— Jean-Michel Morel —opted to study at a Georgian monastery to fine-tune his craft. This rebula (the Slovenian name for Italy’s ribolla) ferments with the skins for thirty days to attain its rich texture and glowing amber hue while retaining vibrancy of fruit—like ripe peach and apricot reined in by savory herbal tones. It calls for sipping outside in the cool fall air and pairs impressively well with anything from tuna crudo to veal sweetbreads.\nFor information: wine-searcher.com\n2008 Radikon Ribolla Gialla\nFriuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy; $55 (500mL)\nStanko Radikon ’s vineyard lies in the village of Oslavia in Italy’s Friuli, just shy of the Slovenian border, and his wines certainly show that cultural cross-pollination. Believing firmly that the true character of ribolla gialla grapes is contained in the skins, he allows this wine an extra-long maceration, resulting in an intense gold hue and a slight cloudiness due to its unfiltered nature. It is full-bodied and packed with wild floral aromas, stone fruit, and spice.\nFor information: wine-searcher.com\n2010 Zidarich Malvasia\nCarso, Italy; $54\nA disciple of Radikon, Benjamin Zidarich tends his vines in the Carso sub-district of Friuli, named for the hard karst limestone soil out of which the local winemakers carve their deep, winding cellars. That minerality is also present in this malvasia, which ferments “sulle bucce” (on the skins), enhancing both the wine’s citrine glow and the juiciness of its fruit. It also bears a distinct saline character it can only get from its proximity to the Adriatic Sea. If you like this and are game for something more intense, try his Prulke—a blend of vitovska, malvasia, and sauvignon blanc.\nFor information: wine-searcher.com\n2012 COS Pithos Bianco\nSicilia, Italy; $34\nGiambattista Cilia and Giusto Occhipinti of Sicily’s COS began experimenting with fermenting their wines in clay amphorae around 2000 to discover that the ones obtained from Spain produced the most interesting results. Pithos Bianco, made from grecanico grapes, undergoes a seven-month maceration in those very vessels, buried in the ground as the Georgians do. Goldenrod in color, it’s a complex web of dried apricot, orange peel, and marzipan flavors, underscored by a seashell-like minerality. Bone-dry and textured like a full-bodied red, it can handle a wide array of savory fare.\nFor information: wine-searcher.com\n2012 Foradori Nosiola Fontanasanta\nVigneti delle Dolomiti, Italy; $48\nWhen Elisabetta Foradori first tasted the amphora-aged wines of COS in 2009, she began reflecting on her own production of nosiola, a native grape variety in her part of the Dolomites thought to be named for the “nocciola” (hazelnut) aromas it exhibits. In eras past, the wine was fermented on the skins. So she sourced terra cotta tinajas (amphorae) in southern Spain, in which the wine now undergoes a long, slow maceration each vintage. She seems to capture a concentration of energy in addition to aromatics by this method, and although the wine is radiant yellow in color, skin-fermenting curbs rather than accentuates the variety’s inherent bitter quality.\nFor information: wine-searcher.com\n2014 Dirty & Rowdy Sémillon\nYountville, California; $39\nHardy Wallace of California’s Dirty & Rowdy finds that the grape variety sémillon is particularly suited to skin-fermenting, which brings out its natural earthy, smoky flavors. His sémillon macerates with the skins for approximately two weeks in open-top fermenters, in the same way one would make certain pinot noirs. The deep straw-hued, subtly hazy wine is firm and unyielding at first, opening up to fresh fig and stony-smoky aromas after a hearty decant. Try it with any mushroom or poultry dish, or richer, meatier pastas.\nFor information: wine-searcher.com", "external_links": ["http://www.wine-searcher.com/"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:05:28.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
