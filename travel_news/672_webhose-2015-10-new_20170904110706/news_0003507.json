Almost 3,000 buyers from North America, and elsewhere around the world, are attending the three-day show – which provides valuable business and networking opportunities for the participating tourism operators rom Ireland.\nAlison Metcalfe, Tourism Ireland’s head of North America, said that there was very good interest in the island of Ireland as a conference and incentive destination at this year’s IMEX America. She said: “IMEX America is an important platform for Tourism Ireland and our partners to showcase the world-class conference, meetings and incentive facilities on offer right around the island of Ireland. Overall, business sentiment at the show is very positive, with interest in Ireland for conferences and incentive travel remaining high and advance business for 2016 looking good.”\nTourism Ireland in North America has had a busy programme of promotions throughout 2015, to continue to build awareness of the island of Ireland as a world-class destination for association conferences and incentive travel – through a programme which included direct marketing, B2B events and familiarisation visits for decision-makers working in the MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and events) sector. Business tourism is the most lucrative form of tourism, with visitors travelling here for business purposes spending about 2.5 times more than the average visitor.\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:58:14.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
