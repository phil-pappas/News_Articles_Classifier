I’m now fascinated by its culture and turbulent history.\n“The expedition was carried out in Armenia as many Syrian refugees were traversing Europe to reach safer places to live. This knowledge, considered against Armenia’s own history, made the expedition very thought-provoking as well as being physically challenging.”\nExpedition highlights\n• Summited Armenia’s Mount Khustup (3206m) and Mount Aramazd (3392m)\n• Reached UNESCO-protected 9th-century Tatev monastery in the Vorotan Gorge\n• Rode one of the world’s longest reversible tramways (cable cars) at 5.7km\n• Completed a challenging expedition in a wild and otherwise tourist-free region\n• Explored Armenia’s newest protected area, the Arevik National Park\nRenowned local guides\nThe team trekked and wild-camped throughout the jagged and arid lesser Caucasus mountain range with two British expedition leaders and two Armenian guides.\nRenowned local guide and alpinist Andranik Miribyan said, “I have never known an expedition team to carry out such an ambitious and challenging traverse in the region. I commend the Secret Compass team members for their pioneering spirit.”\nArmenia’s hiking heritage\nArmenia was an important stop on the Great Silk Road, with traders travelling across Europe and Asia to buy goods including Ararat cochineal. Famous for never fading, this pigment was used for manuscript illustration, rug-making and architectural purposes.\nArmenia also lays claim to the world’s oldest shoe, reputedly 1000 years older than the Great Pyramid of Giza. Probably worn by a nomadic herder around 3500 BC, the shoe was found stuffed with grass to help keep its owner’s feet warm.\nBodkin concluded, “As an expedition company part our ethos is to make history by exploring parts of the world often eschewed by other tour operators.\n“The team didn’t see another visitor throughout their trek and truly experienced the vast, high-altitude solitude of this isolated nation. Following great feedback our August 2016 expedition is now open for applications.”\nUpcoming Secret Compass destinations for 2015 and 2016 include Armenia, Burma, Siberia (Yamal Peninsula and Kamchatka), Iraqi Kurdistan, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Gabon, Sinai, Iran, Panama, Afghanistan’s Wakhan Corridor and more.\nArmenia 2016 expedition fact box\nDates: 27 August – 4 September 2016 (8 nights)\nTeam size: max. 12\nCost: £1,599 ground costs only (all incl. except flights)\nNotes To Editors  \nSecret Compass Expeditions\nSecret Compass is a pioneering expedition company creating world-first experiences for teams of like-minded adventurers.
