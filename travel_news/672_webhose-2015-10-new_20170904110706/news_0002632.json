Photo by John Fischer, licensed to About.com About.com Rating \nVisit Their Website \nSince I described the 5-hour Kos HUMMER Movie/ Lost Adventure Tour on Oahu as \"the most fun I've ever had in over 13 years writing about the island of Oahu\" I'd be hard pressed to say that their adult 10-hour HUMMER Circle Island Lost Location Adventure is better. But, in fact, it was equally as much fun. \nTour Overview \nThe 10-hour tour is a far different type of adventure than the 5-hour tour. While the 5-hour tour spends the majority of time on Kualoa Ranch and in the Ka'a'awa Valley where Lost does extensive filming, the 10-hour tour is literally a \"circle island adventure.\" \nThe tour begins in Waikiki and proceeds east through Kahala around southeast Oahu and the Windward Coast. It then covers the entire length of the North Shore before winding it's way back to Honolulu via Central Oahu. Along the way, you visit well over 30 Lost filming locations, most of which are along the coast. \nOne of the added benefits of the 10-hour tour, especially for first time visitors to Oahu, is that you get to see much more of the island of Oahu. Like the 5-hour tour, it certainly helps to be a fan of Lost and even more so on the 10-hour tour which is exclusively a Lost location tour. \nOnce again, I had the pleasure of riding with Scotty, the driver/guide with whom I took the 5-hour tour a year earlier. Scotty has lost none of his enthusiasm for the show. In fact, his knowledge of Lost equals that of anyone I've met and he has a number of theories for where the show is headed in its final season starting on February 2, 2010. \nLost 's final season began filming in August 2009 and while they were actively filming on the island, we didn't get to see any of the actors this year as I did on my 5-hour tour. We did, however, see locations where the show has already filmed for the upcoming season, several of which gave some clues as to what's to come on the show's final season. \nGreat Bonding Experience \nOne of the real fun aspects of a Kos tour is that the groups are small and you really become quick friends with the others in your group. Aside from Scotty, our group was very international. We had Emma and her brother Steve from England, Talli from Toronto, Canada and Cathy from San Francisco. \nAll of us were huge fans of Lost which immediately helped us bond as we shared our own stories, favorite episodes and characters and our theories for how the show will develop and end. Emma, Steve and Talli were all scheduled to attend the special Lost events that were scheduled for the following weekend as part of the Hawaii International Film Festival. Unfortunately Cathy and I both were scheduled to leave Oahu before the event. \nI was pleasantly surprised to hear that Talli had read my review of the Kos 5-hour tour and that was part of the reason she decided to take the 10-hour tour. It's always great to meet a reader. \nSo, I'm sure you wonder what you get to see on the 10-hour HUMMER Circle Island Lost Location Adventure. It's impossible to list all of the Lost locations that we visited, nor would I want to take away all of the surprises. Also, I should note that not every 10-hour tour is the same. Scotty gave us several options during the day. For example, did we want to save time to stop at the Dole Pineapple Plantation on our way back to Waikiki or see a few more Lost locations? We chose the Lost locations. \nThat being said, I'll offer a brief overview of a number of the stops. \nSoutheast Oahu to the Windward Coast \nAfter making pickup stops at our groups various hotels, we headed east past Diamond Head into the neighborhood of Kahala, to see several of the expensive homes that have been used in Lost . While we all agreed that, if asked, we'd gladly let the show use our home for filming for free, we wondered what the show actually pays for use of a private residence. \nFrom Kahala we traveled through East Oahu to Hanauma Bay (a non-Lost site) where we made a brief bathroom stop and took a few minutes to appreciate the view. From Hanauma Bay we traveled along the coast stopping at the Lana'i lookout and Halona Blowhole where the rocky coastline has been used in several episodes. We passed by Makapu'u Point which was the site of the shore tent village of the Others. From there we made our way to Waimanalo Beach, my favorite beach on Oahu which was used to film Jack's Thailand scenes. \nAfter Waimanalo we drove through the Kailua and Kaneohe areas to the Byodo-In Temple in the Valley of the Temples. This is one of my favorite spots in Hawaii. Lost fans know it as the home of Sun's father, Mr. Paik. We spent about a half hour wandering the grounds of this lovely spot. \nAfter the Byodo-In Temple the tour travels the coastal road to Kualoa Ranch passing several Lost sites along the way. Kualoa Ranch is where the 5-hour tour spends most of its time. The 10-hour tour does not duplicate any of these sites. The stop here is a rest stop and it's the spot where guests settle their bill for the tour. \nWindward Coast to Lunch \nAfter Kualoa Ranch the tour continues its northward trek passing La'ie, site of the Polynesian Cultural Center, making stops at a couple of coastal locations. By this time, it was approaching noon and our next stop, Waimea Valley, was not only a Lost location (the famous waterfall where Kate found the case), but also our lunch stop. Up to this point the Lost locations have all been great, but they were nothing compared to what was ahead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:28:21.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
