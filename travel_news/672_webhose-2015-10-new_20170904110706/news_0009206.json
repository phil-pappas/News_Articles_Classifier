(Photo by Pattarapong Chatpattarasill) - + Department reclaims land for Hmong Phetchabun â€” Authorities have agreed to set out a master plan to crack down on encroachment, shoddy building work and improper land use at Phu Thap Berk, the mountain tourist attraction in Phetchabun. \nProvincial officials and representatives from the Royal Forest Department and the Social Development and Welfare Department met Thursday in Phetchabun to discuss what to do about increasing development on Phu Thap Berk. \nChonlatid Suraswadi, chief of the Royal Forest Department, said a committee would come up with a management plan to better administer an area containing 62 resorts covering more than 1,000 rai on Phu Thap Berk. \nThe management plan will be completed in three months, he said. \nUnder the plan, the Social Development and Welfare Department will be in charge of verifying whether the resort owners are hill tribe people who are entitled to make us of the land. \nThose who are not entitled to occupy the land will face legal action and evictions. \nIn 1966, the government gave the Welfare Department permission to use about 47,000 rai of land on Phu Thap Berk as resettlement areas for Hmong hill tribe people, drawn from various provinces of the country. \nPhu Thap Berk is the highest peak in Phetchabun province. It is also home to the largest cabbage plantation in the country. \nAfter the peak became popular among tourists, welfare-allotted land began to change hands as more resorts were built. Before long, problems of overcrowding, inadequate water supplies and garbage mounted. \nSome 62 resorts have been built in the area without proper official oversight. \nMr Chonlatid said the management plan will include zoning of areas for agriculture and houses, tourism and a forest buffer zone. \nHe said the Royal Forest Department is in the process of evicting 10 resort operators following a court judgement that found them guilty of land encroachment. \n\"We will take immediate legal action with any new cases,\" he said. \nNarong Kongkam, deputy director-general of the Social Development and Welfare Department, said his department's main priority is to take care of 4,124 Hmong families living on Phu Thap Berk. \nHe said local participation is important in developing the master plan and they must abide by the same regulations as anyone else. \nAlso on Thursday, Choke Kaewthong, 50, owner of Rim Than Resort, one of the 10 resorts declared illegal, submitted a petition appealing against his eviction to the Royal Forest Department chief, who visited the area. \nBundit Theveethaivarak, governor of Phetchabun province, said a team of engineers had inspected the 62 resorts, many of which were constructed without approval. \nThe inspection results are expected to be known in the next two weeks, he said. \nMr Bundit said the prime concern is whether the buildings were structurally safe as most of them were constructed haphazardly. \nAny building which is found to be unsafe will be demolished or reconstructed, he said. \n\"After we get the results, we will publish them on our website to allow the public to know which resorts are safe and unsafe. \n\"In an initial examination, we found many failed to comply with safety standards,\" he said. \nMany resorts were constructed carelessly with thin supports in areas with steep gradients, he said. \nThese are at risk as the area has encountered landslides in the past, he said. \nThe governor said the province expects to announce new city planning rules soon. The rules will also include Phu Thap Berk. \nThe rules will also regulate the height, style and colour of buildings. The most important thing is that all future construction projects must be approved by the authorities, Mr Bundit said. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
