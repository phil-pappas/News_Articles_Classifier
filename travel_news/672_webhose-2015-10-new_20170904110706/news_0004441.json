Before hitting the road, it is a wise idea to make sure your vehicle's lights are in proper working order, says the non-profit Car Care Council.\n\"Lights play a critical role in safe driving, as the chance of an accident increases if you can't see or be seen,\" said Rich White , executive director, Car Care Council. \"From the driver's seat you may not notice a light that isn't working, so inspect all of your car's lights and replace those that are out.\"\nLights are normal wear items that require periodic inspection and replacement. The vehicle lighting system provides nighttime visibility; signals and alerts other drivers; and supplies light for viewing instruments and the vehicle's interior. In addition to replacing dimming, rapidly blinking and non-functioning lights, the following tips can help keep you safe:\nKeep headlights, tail lights and signal lights clean. External dirt and debris can dim operational lights from being seen by others. Make sure that your headlights are properly aimed. Misaimed headlights blind other drivers and reduce your ability to see the road. If there is any doubt on whether or not your headlights should be on, turn them on. Lights not only help you see better in early twilight, they also make it easier for other drivers to see you. Don't overdrive your headlights; you should be able to stop inside the illuminated area, otherwise you are creating a blind crash area in front of your vehicle. \"Some states have laws that require the headlights to be on with the wipers,\" said White. \"Keeping your vehicle's lights properly cared for and replacing wiper blades periodically will help ensure a safer ride, keeping the road ahead well-lit and giving you a clear view.\"\nFor more information on vehicle lighting, service interval schedules, questions to ask a technician and tips to drive smart and save money, view the Car Care Council's free digital Car Care Guide online at www.carcare.org/car-care-guide .\nThe non-profit Car Care Council is the source of information for the \"Be Car Care Aware\" consumer education campaign promoting the benefits of regular vehicle care, maintenance and repair to consumers.
