Guy next to me thought I was Australian X — russell tovey (@russelltovey) October 3, 2015 \nOther offences then ranged from stealing Tovey's blanket to snoring and sneezing - seven or eight times. He's also stolen my blanket and sneezed around about 7 or 8 times.. I said 'bless you' first three... I can't be bothered anymore X — russell tovey (@russelltovey) October 3, 2015 And it's kinda embarrassing.. I mean.. How much dust is there up your nose? X — russell tovey (@russelltovey) October 3, 2015 Oh it's coughing now X — russell tovey (@russelltovey) October 3, 2015 I'm actually freezing... Gonna ask for another blanket, he's not wearing any shoes.. X — russell tovey (@russelltovey) October 3, 2015 \nTovey was then given a surprise when he received an offer of a new blanket from a couple of blokes a few seats back. These guys are actually following my tweets from 3 rows behind me! Say hello to @0EmissionCar hahaha #mental X pic.twitter.com/TguXZUJazE — russell tovey (@russelltovey) October 3, 2015 Thanks for the blanket boys! @0EmissionCar :-) X", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:47:12.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
