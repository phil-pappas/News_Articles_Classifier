I invite him to come to Delhi and do the concert. Music has no boundaries\" tweeted Mishra. \nThe 75-year-old Pakistani singer was scheduled to perform in Mumbai and Pune this week as part of the fourth death anniversary tribute to late singer Jagjit Singh. But the show in Mumbai was called off on Wednesday after Shiv Sena threatened to disrupt his live concert. \nThe musician said the cancellation was disappointing as the concert was a tribute to Jagjit Singh who was like a brother to him. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:06:33.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
