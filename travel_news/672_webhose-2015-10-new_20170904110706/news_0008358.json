Their triumph in the engineering stage came at the expense of fellow candidates Hazem Khaled of Egypt and Naouel Ayari of Tunisia , who fell short in the eyes of the jury. To view the Multimedia News Release, please click: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7658151-stars-of-science-ksa-palestine/ The program sees young innovators compete against each other to turn their creative ideas into reality and is part of QF's mission to encourage Arab youth to reach their potential while fostering and providing a platform to facilitate success. Twelve candidates aged 18 to 30 from across the Arab world travel to Doha, Qatar , where they are mentored by world-class engineering and design specialists in the laboratories of Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP), a member of Qatar Foundation. There, the innovators take on challenges as they develop their ideas from a concept to a potential product. In this first of three elimination rounds during the engineering stage, the candidates presented their prototypes to an expert panel of jurors. The group, with one computer scientist as well as one Master's and two doctoral students, used its academic firepower to develop projects aimed to make life easier in vastly different ways. Both Hazem and Hassan used advanced technology with innovative thinking to solve age-old problems. Hazem's Sign Language EMG Sleeve is designed to translate hand movements to words and sounds to ease communication for the deaf. Hassan's EEG Cap Analyzer uses sensors to measure and alert users to drowsiness. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:28:33.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
