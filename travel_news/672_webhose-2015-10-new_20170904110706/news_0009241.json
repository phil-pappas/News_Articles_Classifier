Then they’ll go into the kitchen for a cooking lesson and a chocolate and wine tasting; travel into the Mayan heartland to visit archeological sites, the jungle, and the underground Cenotes; and finally, have a private golf lesson and a massage. \nAlso on the agenda is Jonathan Bradshaw, CEO of the Meetology Group, sharing communication tips based on behavioral research, to help you connect with clients and colleagues; IAN Johnson, president of Out Now, on how to win a piece of the $200 billion LGBT travel business; and a panel moderated by TMR’s own Anne Marie Moebes. \nThe name REAL is an acronym for the four niches the trade show will include: Romance, Experiential travel, Adventure, and Lifestyles (such as LGBT and Luxury). \nIt’s a unique and different travel show that combines education, networking, and experiences. We hope you can RSVP yes and be a guest at our Mexican destination wedding! \nFor more information or to register visit www.therealtravelexperience.com . 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:08:34.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
