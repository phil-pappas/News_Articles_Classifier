Lia lived in the city at the time and Andrew was in town for a quick work trip. “The next day he invited me out, and on our date, he told me I should move to California to be with him,” remembers Lia. Their connection can only be described as instant. “I responded, saying I had to go upstate to record my album, but could be there in six weeks. I stuck to my word and we’ve been together ever since.”\nThe proposal happened four years later in Martha’s Vineyard. “We were there with family, and I had gone for a walk to get wildflowers for my mother,” says Lia. “Andrew followed me and suggested we keep walking to the beach, a mile from my parents’ house. He popped the question once we were there, and I simply agreed nonchalantly because it had been a hot topic for us recently. And he was like, ‘No! I’m asking you for real now.’ I started to cry. We walked back to the house and my family was waiting with champagne—then we all went to dinner at The Outermost Inn that night.”\nMartha’s Vineyard—specifically, Aquinnah at the upper end of the island—has always been a special place for Lia. “It’s magical to me—not only because of how insanely beautiful it is, but what it has come to represent. Every summer, my family heads there for a couple weeks, and we reset our clocks for the entire year: We swim in the ocean together, go to the farmers’ market, the local fish market, hike through the woods, make amazing dinners, and stargaze uninterrupted by the trials of everyday life.” With all of these memories in mind, choosing Aquinnah as her venue was a no-brainer.\nLia has always been a big fan of Rosie Assoulin , so when she found out the designer had started making wedding dresses, the decision was made. “I think Rosie Assoulin is a genius,” admits Lia. “The dress I wore was exceptionally feminine but also very sculptural and minimal, almost technical. Her work is not frothy—even a pleat for her has a measured coolness. My look was architectural, iconic, and entirely feminine—it has bows! And the craftsmanship is just so special.”\nShe also wore a Jennifer Behr crystal headband made of little stars because she is interested in space and all things astrological. “My bouquet was my favorite flower, star jasmine,” she says. “And I wore rings on all my fingers, including my grandmother’s Colombian emerald. My hair and makeup were simple—I knew I wanted my hair off my face, and a sleek straight ponytail seemed to be the right amount of balance for the dress. Plus, it showed off my back. One of the things I liked most about the dress is that it almost looks like a bathing suit from behind. I am always a fan of creating moments of contrast within one context . . . so I absolutely loved that the ball gown skirt shape was married to the ultra sporty. There are many ways to feel like a bride!”\nThe couple got married in a tiny white Native American Baptist church in Aquinnah that is situated on the same road as Lia’s family’s house. “It’s the oldest Native American Baptist church in the country, and it was founded in the 1690s by the Wampanoag tribe,” she explains. “I’ve been fascinated by it for years—it’s simple and tiny and so unique. Everyone had to cram in to see the ceremony, though.” The bride walked down the aisle to the Beatles’s “Here Comes the Sun,” played on an old upright piano, and the couples’ four siblings, best friend, and the local pastor joined them at the altar. “We incorporated the Native American wedding tradition of washing our hands together on the altar before saying our vows, which was very special,” says Lia.\nDinner and the reception were at The Outermost Inn, where Lia’s family has dined summer after summer. “It sits at the most western tip of the island, with the most romantic rolling meadows and a view of the lighthouse,” explains Lia. “Being on an island is very powerful—you are by nature disconnected. And I really wanted to highlight how enchanting the whole experience is.” The couple had an open-air tent set up on the property, and flowers and chains of carnations and delphinium were hung from the ceiling to convey a whimsical romantic vibe, while the centerpieces incorporated fruit on branches. Their friend, Carrie Wilkinson, from Chez Panisse in Berkeley, came out to cook for the wedding and created a menu with lobster bisque, grilled rib eye, slow-roasted local fish, summer vegetables, and sweet corn as the highlights. The meal was served with magnums of Pinot Noir from Andrew’s winery and finished off with a cheese plate and Lia’s favorite dessert, Pavlova with berries. Chris Gillespie from the Carlyle hotel brought a band out and played all night. “I surprised Andrew and performed ‘Thank You’ by Bonnie Raitt with the band—it’s always been one of our faves,” says Lia. “After the band finished, our friends Hank and Effie from Hudson, New York, spun vinyl, and we all danced to awesome soul and old hip-hop. At the end of the night, everyone hung out by the fire pit, drank wine, and some of us went swimming—there were phosphorescence in the ocean that night!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:16:19.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
