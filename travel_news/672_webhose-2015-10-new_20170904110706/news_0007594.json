Following the success of the 2015 hosted buyer programme – with 98% of buyers agreeing that they achieved their objectives at the show – a number of new hosted buyer groups have also already been confirmed. Plans to further develop the hosted buyer programme –including increasing the amount of time buyers spend at the show – will be announced later in the year.\nThe new education initiatives already confirmed are designed to meet the interests of the industry at different levels and to cover several key trends, including a new track on personal development, plus enhancements to the CSR and wellbeing programme.\nA high level panel discussion on the rapidly developing sharing economy and its potential role in the meetings and events sector will be held on Wednesday 20 April. Reflecting on the growth of businesses such as Airbnb, Uber and Bookalokal, this session will look at how the industry can adapt to this trend and use it co-operatively. There will also be additional sessions on this theme at the Inspiration Hub during the show.\nAlso at a senior level will be the first PCMA Business School in Frankfurt providing MBA standard education presented by a university professor. This follows the successful implementation of PCMA’s signature Business School programme at IMEX America.\nCarina Bauer, CEO of the IMEX Group commented: “We have worked hard to innovate and develop IMEX in Frankfurt from all angles – looking at the show experience for hosted buyers, exhibitors and other visitors. These innovations will be seen across the show – from small details in the hosted buyer lounge – to larger events and educational initiatives. As the industry continues to develop we are determined to ensure that IMEX in Frankfurt not only provides the industry with the business opportunities that it expects, but also provides buyers and suppliers alike with insights, new knowledge and inspiration for their own programmes, businesses or events.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:40:53.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
