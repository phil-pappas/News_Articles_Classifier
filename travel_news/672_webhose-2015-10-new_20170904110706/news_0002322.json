It has a restaurant as well, plus three guestrooms with sea views. The welcome is so lovely, you feel like you have been invited to stay by friends.\nOwner Gerald Pailloux will share his passion for beers: he keeps many types in his cellar and recommends a new favourite every time, like Anosteké IPA and blonde from a small brewery in French Flanders. He used to be a naval architect, and has decorated the place with his amazing model boats.\nYou can sit looking out to sea eating delicious porc aux champignons, and the friendly regulars make for a great atmosphere. When I was shooting Witnesses in the area, the bar was the perfect place for the cast and crew to relax after a long day of shooting. I’ve great memories of being there with Jan Hammencker and Thierry Lhermitte after work. I hope to go back when we begin filming Witnesses again.\n• 5 Boulevard Michel Couillet, Ault, France, flibustier-nelson.blogspot.co.uk\nSeason one of Witnesses is released on DVD and Blu-Ray through Arrow Films on 5 October", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/30/1443607245980/bdc552e4-cec2-4a78-8ccc-cfc40fbd0079-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f2364cc55420dbffd7f510001a364dc2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/30/1443607245980/bdc552e4-cec2-4a78-8ccc-cfc40fbd0079-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=834ebf13754246b714de1bd653f691a2", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpz8%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpz8&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F30%2F1443613714765%2F84777298-e6b8-46aa-9b5a-4cd9fe51bf1c-1376x2040.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/30/1443613714765/84777298-e6b8-46aa-9b5a-4cd9fe51bf1c-1376x2040.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=e417de7ddf9e3017c93a51e88140b328", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Great%20beer%2C%20fine%20food%20and%20views%20%E2%80%93%20the%20Normandy%20guesthouse%20that%20has%20it%20all&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cpz8%2Fstw%23img-2", "http://flibustier-nelson.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/blog-post.html", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/30/1443613714765/84777298-e6b8-46aa-9b5a-4cd9fe51bf1c-1376x2040.jpeg?w=120&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d67db21d5590079fc40b6919764573c5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/30/1443613714765/84777298-e6b8-46aa-9b5a-4cd9fe51bf1c-1376x2040.jpeg?w=140&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=e7e16b3536b9ccafc8e7b1e7aa9f4746", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/30/1443607245980/bdc552e4-cec2-4a78-8ccc-cfc40fbd0079-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=be1fd2a1aab67c3e0570e481d19d71fa", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Great+beer%2C+fine+food+and+views+%E2%80%93+the+Normandy+guesthouse+that+has+it+all&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F30%2Fbar-la-flibustiere-ault-normandy-marie-dompnier-witnesses&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F30%2F1443613714765%2F84777298-e6b8-46aa-9b5a-4cd9fe51bf1c-1376x2040.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/30/1443607245980/bdc552e4-cec2-4a78-8ccc-cfc40fbd0079-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=3c582e8f8e0df2cf0d633c5c5daa4e60"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:20:16.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
