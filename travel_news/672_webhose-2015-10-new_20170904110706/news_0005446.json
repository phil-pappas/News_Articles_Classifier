The conferences combined,will attract around 5,000 delegates and are worth an estimated €7million to the Irish economy.\nNick Waight, CEO of The CCD commented, “We are delighted to have secured these two prestigious meetings for Ireland.With the announcement of DrupalCon 2016, we will be making a significant infrastructure investment by doubling our Wi-Fi capacity to facilitate 24,000 devices in the venue.We are also looking forward to welcoming INQUA to Ireland for the first time after working very closely with Professor Peter Coxon from Trinity College and the Irish Quaternary Association (IQUA)over the last few years.We would like to thank our industry partners, Dublin Convention Bureau (DCB) for their tremendous support in bringing these two conferences to Dublin and to acknowledge Keynote PCO for their extensive work securing the INQUA bid.”\nMiriam Kennedy, Head of Business Tourism, Fáilte Ireland added, “These two events are worth €7 million to the Irish economy, so naturally Fáilte Ireland is delighted to have worked with all those involved locally to help secure them for Dublin. International Conferences are a key target within our plans to grow tourism into Ireland, with the average delegate worth two to three times that of a holidaymaker. Our conference ambassador programme, which supports peers to bring their international conference to Ireland, continues to deliver really strong results, as is the case here with INQUA”.\nThe Drupal Association announced at its 2015 conference in Barcelona that it would be bringing its next DrupalCon conference to Dublin in September 2016. The five-day annual conference will see over 2,000 Drupal developers, site-builders, UX/designers, project managers, business owners and Chief Information Officerscome together to learn, share and discuss issues.\nRachel Friesen, Events Manager, Drupal Association commented, “We are absolutely thrilled to be bringing DrupalCon to Dublin. Drupal has a thriving local community in Dublin and throughout Ireland, and when paired with Dublin’s strong tech scene, it created the perfect location for DrupalCon 2016.”\nThe INQUA Congress takes place every four years, and following an extended and very competitive bidding process, Dublin was selected over the other candidate cities Zaragoza (Spain) and Rome (Italy). Around 3,000 delegates are expected to attend the seven-day congress in 2019 which will include a lecture programme and excursions throughout Ireland, Northern Ireland and parts of the UK.\nCatherine Dalton, President of IQUAcommented, “The congress will showcase the Irish landscape, promote Ireland’s research reputation, facilitate the dissemination of our research activities to a wider audience and attract world-class scientists to the country. The successful award of the 2019 INQUA Congress truly demonstrates an accomplishment far beyond what would be expected, given the relatively small size of our academic community.”\nDr. Noel Mitchell, Managing Director of Keynote PCO added, “We’re very pleased that INQUA has awarded this prestigious congress to Ireland, and recognised the efforts of the Irish society in its proposal as hosts for a global audience”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:44:12.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
