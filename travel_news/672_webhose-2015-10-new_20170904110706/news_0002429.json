It seems they aren't getting enough shut eye, anyway. This is interesting food for thought that led the Sleep Inn® hotel brand to dig deeper into the state of American sleep. The findings were eye-opening. And now the brand that prides itself on better dreams and relaxing rest is asking Americans around the country to take a stand for more sleep and join the \"Let's Sleep Inn\" Movement.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7267151-sleep-inn-movement/\n\"We are launching the 'Let's Sleep Inn' Movement because the Sleep Inn hotel brand recognizes the vital importance of a good night's rest – for health, happiness and even, perhaps, the American economy. The word 'Sleep' is not only in the name of our Sleep Inn hotels, it's in our brand DNA,\" said Anne Smith , vice president of brand strategy for Choice Hotels. \"We wanted to learn more about how and when Americans are sleeping. Our survey not only reveals interesting trends about sleep styles and preferences, but also just how much people would be willing to give up or trade for more quality rest.\"\nAmericans value sleep so much that a staggering 42.7% people would give up social media for snoozing. But there is a discrepancy between how much they should be sleeping versus how much they actually are sleeping. When asked what the ideal amount of sleep time was for them, on average, people polled said 8.15 hours but in reality only received 6.51 hours a night. That means on average each respondent missed about 730 hours of sleep time that they wished they had every year!\nThat extra hour could also be costing businesses their bottom line: according to the survey, more than 65% of respondents indicated that 1-2 more hours of sleep each day would make them more productive at work. And almost half of the participants admitted to falling asleep at the office, which prompted three out of four people to agree that companies should encourage naps at the office.\nAs part of the Movement, the Sleep Inn brand will offer the chance to enter to win a day of rest through a sweepstakes where one lucky winner will win a day in bed, including a personal helper for the day, trip for two and a prize pack that will help promote a well-rested, stylish sleep 2 . Consumers can enter the sweepstakes until November 6 th , just as they are adjusting their sleep schedules around the conclusion of daylight saving time.\n\"People often say they don't get enough shut eye. Sleep Inn is the hotel brand leisure and business travelers choose for a good night's rest because we place value on sleep as the cornerstone of our simply stylish guest experience in our Sleep Inn Designed to Dream® hotels.\" said Smith. \"We are so happy to be able to offer the opportunity for a lucky guest to enter for the chance to win a day of more rest and hope people will join us in this movement to declare a good night's sleep, whether they are at home or on the road.\"\nSleep Inn hotel properties across the U.S. are joining the Movement to offer guests the chance to enter to win a day of rest. Until November 6th , the participating Sleep Inn Designed to Dream hotels across the country will celebrate the importance of sleep by offering travelers a one-hour late check-out time so they can sleep in and enjoy the cozy Sleep Inn Designed to Dream beds a little longer.\nThe Sleep Inn tagline is Dream Better Here® because the brand believes in giving guests a good night's rest and sweet dreams with cozy beds, free amenities 3 , and a simply stylish setting – all at a price that they can afford.
