Because it’s just you on the bike, there’s a lot of times I feel as if I have to stop now, it’s too hard, I’m going to pull off, but you find a way to get through it.\n“I’m trying to use the motivation of all our kids, who show amazing strength and character with everything they do every day, and I’m thinking I can’t pull out, I can’t take a short cut, the kids wouldn’t do that so I can’t do it.”\nSteve Waugh stares down Curtly Ambrose. Source: News Limited\nThe Steve Waugh Foundation marks its 10th anniversary of helping young sufferers of rare diseases this year and Waugh was looking to mark the occasion in typically challenging fashion.\nHe wants to raise more than $600,000 for the youngsters his foundation helps — some whose diseases are so rare they are the only sufferers of it in Australia — and knew that to do so he’d need to come up with an out-of-the-box idea.\nWaugh had never seriously cycled until four months ago, but after a friend of his completed the Sydney-Byron ride after a quadruple heart by-pass, the former Australian skipper decided it was the event that could capture the public’s interest.\nHe’s gathered 60 riders to make the trip including celebrities Mick Doohan, John Maclean, pro-cyclist Simon Gerrans and Dr Charlie Teo.\nThey’ll cover approximately 150km a day across the NSW countryside, through the Hunter Valley, Gloucester, Armidale, Dorrigo and Grafton, before arriving into Byron Bay on Friday, November 6.\n“The rare disease patient is the orphan of the health system, often without diagnosis, without treatment, without research and therefore without reason to hope,” Waugh said.\n“This is why the Steve Waugh Foundation exists. The Australian rare disease community is growing, with a leading number of medical and advocacy groups joining together to give those living with a rare disease a voice.”\nTo read individual stories about the children the Waugh Foundation is helping and to make a donation towards Waugh’s efforts, visit www.stevewaughfoundation.com.au\n 920km tougher than facing Ambrose", "external_links": ["http://www.stevewaughfoundation.com.au/", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/26/1227583/148930-581530c4-7bc2-11e5-b858-124d84ad5405.jpg", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/former-test-captain-steve-waugh-to-embark-on-920km-bike-ride-for-charity/story-fni2fnmo-1227583149993", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/26/1227583/149746-67729d90-7bc2-11e5-b858-124d84ad5405.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-27T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:51:33.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
