In the pink with C Qantas Group pilots will FlyPink from tomorrow swapping out their normal gold shoulder stripes for pink epaulettes in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The Australian-first initiative was started by QantasLink Captain Susan McHaffie whose aunt was diagnosed with and beat breast cancer. Joining the airline in 2013, McHaffie was inspired by the National Breast Cancer Foundation-branded pink QantasLink aircraft to find a way to raise funds and awareness for breast cancer research that would encourage airlines around the world to join together for the cause. Qantas Group pilots who will wear pink epaulettes include Qantas, QantasLink, Jetstar, JetConnect, Cobham, Network Aviation and Express Freighters Australia. Writing on the wall Frankfurt's international airport has been overwhelmed by graffiti - 360 metres of it - but the entire mural was put up with the approval of the authorities. At the bus station outside the airport's Terminal 1, graffiti sprayer-artist Helge Steinmann was commissioned to decorate a long wall with 15 subjects, among them the Roemer city hall, the city zoo, the Alte Oper opera house, the Main River shoreline, the airport, and even the Eintracht Frankfurt football stadium. Fraport, owner of Europe's third-biggest air travel hub, said the art is meant to make a \"clear statement about our hometown\". - DPA Jordan takes a pass Jordan aims to attract more tourists with a new visitor pass providing free entry to 40 sightseeing attractions. It also entitles you to a visa at no fee, the country's tourism office said. The ticket includes free entry to the famous cliff city of Petra and the desert valley Wadi Rum, as well as to such lesser-known sites as the Church of the Apostles and the crusaders' castle of Kerak. The price of the pass depends on the length of a visitor's stay at Petra, a Unesco World Cultural Heritage Site. The one-day \"Wanderer\" pass costs 70 dinars (about Bt350). The two-day \"Explorer\" pass costs 75 dinars and the three-day \"Expert\" pass 80 dinars. The entry visa of 40 dinars is being waived if the visitor has obtained a pass beforehand and it is shown to immigration officers at the airport. Online orders of the pass can be made at www.JordanPass.jo. Mondrian exhibition opens Fans of abstract painting are heading to Berlin for a major exhibition featuring Piet Mondrian (1872-1944), one of the leading figures in the abstract movement. Through December 6, the Martin Gropius Bau museum is the venue for an exhibition showing the Dutch painter's progression from his early impressionist works all the way through to his famous line paintings with their red, yellow and blue surfaces. Some 50 works are featured in the exhibition, \"Piet Mondrian: The Line,\" with most of the paintings on loan from the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague. - DPA The three Henrys The Hong Kong Arts Festival Society has confirmed that the Royal Shakespeare Company will return to Hong Kong with three plays to commemorate Shakespeare's 400th anniversary. \"Henry IV\" Parts I & II and \"Henry V\" follow the young prince's awakening to his role and duty as heir to the British throne, transforming from a rebellious teenager to a great military leader. The acclaimed production stars Antony Sher as Shakespeare's most beloved comic character Falstaff and Alex Hassell as Henry and features an outstanding ensemble cast. Though each of the Henry plays is self-contained and can be watched as a stand-alone story, only by seeing all three would you be able to experience the true intention of Shakespeare, capturing the politics of King and Country. 176 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:48:38.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
