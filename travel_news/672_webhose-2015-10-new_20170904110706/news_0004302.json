But this was ridiculous.\nIt seemed like an age since we merrily decamped from a sunny South London for the long drive west, only to be met by increasingly inclement weather.\nThe rain had started with a gentle drizzle and a few nervous jokes, and ended coming at us horizontally with the only noise in the car a sobbing eldest child.\nFamily break: Chris Greenwood at the Cornish Seal Sanctuary with Anna, 7 and Joe, 3\nCornwall's rugged coastline is a haven for pirates and a thrill for imaginative toddlers\nThe Poltesco caravan are modern and comfortably furnished with features such as a DVD player and TV, heated towel rails and beds made up for your first night\nOn arrival at Sea Acres run by Parkdean, the clouds were at ground level and visibility was about 50 metres.\nFrankly we could have been anywhere. Oh, and did I mention it was August?\nHilariously, although my wife may disagree, we were met on arrival by park manager Ray, our very own beam of sunshine.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Blood and black magic: Incredible pictures show the...

With tempers frayed it was a godsend to be able to book a table straight away at the onsite restaurant for dinner that night.\nThere is a small shop selling essentials, an indoor swimming pool, which is pretty rough and ready, but does the job, mini-golf and even a laundrette.\nFor children of all ages there are activities every day, led by the ubiquitous Sid the seagull and Lizzie the lizard. Those guys work hard.\nCadgwith Cove is a wonderful two-mile walk along the coastal path and boasts fresh fish and the nearest pub to Sea Acres\nChildren love making a new home and a modern Poltesco caravan means you will be living in style\nThe curiously named village of Gweek on the Helford River, close to the Cornish Seal Sanctuary\nAnd then in the evening they take the stage in the bar for kids’ shows, followed by bingo and entertainment for the grown-ups.\nI was a bit cautious at first, but as every parent knows if the children are happy then everyone is happy.\nAnd my two lapped up the magic shows, competitions and daily discos. Of course you don’t have to attend any of it.\nBut there is little not to like about someone else wearing out the youngsters while you have a drink and a natter.\nThe Sea Acres park is in an enviable location, literally at the end of the road as Ray gleefully pointed out, on the south east corner of the Lizard Peninsula.\nWhen the clouds finally lifted and they did intermittently for some glorious weather, we could see this is pirate country, with a rugged and rocky coastline stretching away from you into the distance.\nPoldhu Cove is a favourite for young sand engineers (left) because of the stream which runs down through the beach. There is also plenty of wind, perfect for kite flying (right) and windsurfing\nLets go fly a kite: Anna enjoys a fun-filled day on the beach at Poldhu Cove\nThe park is a short walk from Kennack Sands beach, which has everything you could hope for in a Cornish cove - sand, surf, rock pools teaming with life and a handy ice cream shop.\nOn our last night, with the warm evening sun shining down and horse riders wandering through to paddle in the shallows, it really made for an idyllic spot.\nThere is plenty to do a short drive away from Sea Acres and we took full advantage of an unexpectedly sunny morning with a trip to the Seal Sanctuary at Gweek.\nIt hosts a band of dedicated and knowledgeable staff who tend to sick and injured seals picked up from around the South West coast.\nWe were lucky enough to get a chance to toss a few mackerel to the seals and it is a decent spot to spend a few hours.

It is home to the nearest pub too.\nAnd the Polpeor Café on the tip of the Lizard one wet and blustery evening was a treat.\nIt serves gigantic portions of good food and you might even spot a seal from your table.\nA week on the Lizard places all this on your doorstep and that is the real attraction, because even in Cornwall it can’t rain 24 hours a day in August.\nThe Sea Acres park comes complete with a heated indoor swimming pool to keep the kids entertained\nSimple pleasures: Along with the facilities offered on site, heading to the nearby beach with a bucket, spade and net can keep nature lovers occupied\nTRAVEL FACTS Seven nights at Sea Acres staying in a three-bedroom Poltesco caravan in August 2016 is around £1,249.
