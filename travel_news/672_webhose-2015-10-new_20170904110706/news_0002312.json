The League is being recognized in the \"Green Power Partner of the Year\" category for its leadership, overall strategy, and impact on the green power market. As the NHL's official preferred energy provider , Constellation works with the NHL to conduct energy efficiency analyses and recommend energy management strategies for NHL arenas and team facilities. Additionally, Constellation provides Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets to match the League's estimated total carbon footprint. For the 2015-16 season, the League will continue its partnership with Constellation in support of its energy and environmental goals. \"Constellation congratulates the NHL for its continued commitment to sustainability,\" said Mark Huston, president of Constellation Retail. \"We look forward to partnering again with the NHL and advancing the League's efforts to promote responsible energy use.\" During the 2014-15 season, Constellation supplied more than 271 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of Green-eÂ® Energy Certified* RECs to match all NHL games and premier events with energy generated from environmentally preferable renewable resources. Constellation also supplied Green-e Climate certified carbon offsets to match 126,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e), the estimated amount of GHG emissions resulting from certain League activities such as waste-to-landfill and air travel. Through its partnership with Constellation, the NHL now ranks as the 17th largest user of green power in the U.S. , according to the EPA's Green Power Partnership. Constellation is also a supporter of NHL Green , the comprehensive environmental sustainability initiative launched by the League in 2010 to address the effects of climate change and freshwater scarcity on the game of hockey. The NHL is the first professional sports league in North America to issue a sustainability report, documenting and disclosing the League's carbon footprint. * Green-e Energy certifies that renewable energy certificates meet the minimum environmental and consumer protection standards established by the non-profit Center for Resource Solutions. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:19:38.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
