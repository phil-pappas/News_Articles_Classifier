The Green Truck of the Year™ nominees are the Chevrolet Colorado Duramax, Ford F-150, GMC Canyon Duramax, Nissan Titan XD, and Toyota Tacoma. Vying for the all-new 2016 Commercial Green Car of the Year™ award are the Chevrolet City Express, Ford Transit Connect, Mercedes-Benz Metris , Nissan NV200, and Ram ProMaster City.\n\"Over the past few decades, new car models have benefitted from design and technology improvements that have brought higher fuel efficiency and greater levels of environmental compatibility,\" said Green Car Journal and CarsOfChange.com Editor and Publisher Ron Cogan . \"With models like these ten deserving finalists, we're witnessing the pickup and light commercial vehicle field enjoying the same attention.\"\nThe new Commercial Green Car of the Year™ award is part of an expanded awards program presented at this year's 2015 San Antonio Auto & Truck Show. It recognizes the growing importance of efficient and environmentally positive vehicles, such as compact vans, often used by small businesses and fleets.\n\"These finalists showcase how improved environmental performance is becoming part of the DNA of pickups and light commercial vehicles,\" said San Antonio Auto Dealers Association President Pam Crail . \"Recognizing the importance of these advanced technologies at the San Antonio Auto & Truck Show is an important step toward encouraging more of these vehicles on South Texas highways.\"\nAs part of the vetting process, Green Car Journal evaluates the environmental achievement of pickups and light-duty commercial vehicles, along with their all-important functionality. Vehicles running on all fuels and technologies are considered. Market significance, 'newness,' and other important criteria are weighed as the field is narrowed to five finalists for each award. Models that have won in previous years are not considered unless they are a new generation, significantly changed, or incorporate important 'green' powertrains or technology that is all-new to the existing model. The Ram 1500 EcoDiesel won last year's 2015 Green Truck of the Year™ award.\n\"Upgrading a fleet to more fuel efficient and economical vehicles is a great way for fleet managers to improve air quality, as well as save money,\" said Alamo Area Clean Cities Coordinator Nicholas Jones . \"Showcasing these vehicles brings much needed attention to the advances manufacturers have made in designing dependable and economical vehicle choices.\"\nAbout Green Car Journal\nThe Green Truck of the Year™ and Commercial Green Car of the Year™ awards are an important part of Green Car Journal's mission to showcase environmental progress in the auto industry.
