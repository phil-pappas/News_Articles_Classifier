However, I think that I am about to review the greatest ExOfficio product thus far: the Give-N-Go Sports Mesh Boxer Briefs . . . these are the most spectacular pair of underwear I have ever worn. \nExOfficio claims that you can take one (or possibly two) pair Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs on a 7 day, 500 mile adventure. This is an extremely bold claim for a pair of underwear and something that an experienced traveler knows is probably not a good idea. \n(picture courtesy of LifeHacker ) \nOnce I was able to try a pair of ExOfficioâ€™s underwear I kind of started to buy into what they were saying. The economic fit of the ultralight mesh is unbelievably comfortable and prefect for pretty much anything active. Great, there are lots of fantastic pairs of underwear on the market, why would you only need one or two pairs of the ExOfficio for a week long trip? The answer is their Sports Mesh. \nWhat makes Sports Mesh so awesome? \nThere are five main factors that make Sports Mesh the idea underwear fabric. It is unbelievably lightweight, giving it a feather-like feel when worn, extremely fast drying, ideal for the sports/active minded traveler odor resistant, an obvious plus. water wicking, helping keep the wearer dryer when out and about. breathable mesh, another factor that keeps the ExOfficio underwear dry and comfortable Why only one or two pair of ExOfficio Underwear for a week vacation? \nThis idea for light packing is probably not for everyone, and you may want to just go ahead and use the chart I posted above to determine how many pair of underwear you would like to take on any given trip. However, if you want to see how light you can pack and you want to take ExOfficio up on their claim, here is the main idea they are going for. \nSo it is pretty clear that the Sports Mesh materials that make up the ExOfficio underwear lines (boxers and briefs are also offered) create a pretty amazing pair of underwear, but where do they get off saying that you only need one or two pair? Well, this claim is based on the versatility of the Sports Mesh material. The fast drying, odor resistant, water wicking, and breathable material that make up each pair of underwear will go much further as far as uses than any other underwear you might use. Again I must stress, this is not for everyone. Color Options from ExOfficio \nClaims of single pair usage aside, the ExOfficios that I have been wearing ar30 hands down some of the very best underwear I have ever worn. They would be extremely comfortable for a long plane flight or train ride, or keep you dry and un-chafed during a day hike/city tour. They come in a variety of colors and sizes (S to 2XL), and are priced at $30.00. Click here to check out if ExOfficio should be your travel underwear of choice.
