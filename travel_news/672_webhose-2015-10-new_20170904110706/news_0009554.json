Credit: PA Wire Plans for an upgrade at one of Wales' most notorious traffic bottlenecks go on display today.\nThe A487, at Machynlleth, is regularly closed by flooding or damage by vehicles. That leads to long diversions and disruption.\nThe proposed £24m scheme consists of a new viaduct structure which will cross the River Dyfi upstream of the existing bridge near Machynlleth.\nThe A487 is an important part of the Welsh north-south and east-west trunk road network. However the current Dyfi Bridge creates a pinch-point on this important road. This new bridge will greatly improve safety, journey times and network resilience, while enabling the historic Grade II* listed original bridge to remain in place.\n– Edwina Hart AM, Transport Minister Last updated Wed 7 Oct 2015 Travel Machynlleth Mid and West Wales", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:46:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
