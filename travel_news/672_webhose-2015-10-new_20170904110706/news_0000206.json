GLō is a broad-midscale new construction brand that offers a hip, boutique-style experience for savvy travelers who expect the best in value, design and comfort.\nThe boutique hotel segment is hot and here to stay. The opportunity? Boutique brands currently are all designed for the luxury, upper-upscale and upscale segments; Best Western Vîb® being one of only two brands in the upper-midscale segment.\n“We looked at the segmentation of boutique hotels and realized Glō would fill a void because of the lack of a boutique product in the broad midscale segment,” said David Kong, president and CEO Best Western Hotels & Resorts. “Developers are expressing interest in a boutique brand for secondary markets with a high density population. With the demand to build a hotel product that is fresh, chic and contemporary, we see tremendous opportunity for GLō to change the development landscape in the midscale segment.”\nAs the name implies, the brand glows in many ways. GLō’s architecture and design have elements that speak to the name with the use of signature LED elements. LED lighting is articulated on the side of the building and in the glowing blue scarf, providing an unmistakable beacon at night, while the “Lite Brite” wall greets guest outside and extends inside behind the glowing welcome desk. During the day, the alternating blue and gold window panes bring the building to life.\nWith an innovative design strategy, GLō had been engineered to be cost effective to build. For example, the floor plan is designed so that the adjacent guest room baths are center-loaded, saving about 40-50 square feet in construction costs.\nForm and function are carried throughout the design in the thoughtful approach to signature furniture elements and durable but stylish finishes in the guest rooms and lobby. Furniture pieces maximize space and are multi-functional. Finishes add to the warmth of GLō’s chic and contemporary design and create an ambience that is both energetic and comfortable for guests to relax and hang out.\n“With the demand we are seeing for this broad-midscale boutique brand, coupled with the lower barrier to entry costs of secondary and suburban markets, we expect GLō development to ramp up very quickly,” added Ron Pohl, senior vice president brand management.\nDesigned as a four-story, 70 room new construction hotel, GLō is forecast to cost $65,000 per key and depending on the market, generate a healthy average daily rate of approximately $90 in the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:38:11.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
