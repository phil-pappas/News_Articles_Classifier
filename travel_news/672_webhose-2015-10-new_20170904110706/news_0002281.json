Maybe this is a little unfair to the man who would go on to make Robin Hood sound like he came from Los Angeles. Not least because the idea of constructing a gleaming something (a resort, a hotel, a city) in the middle of nowhere – in the hope that, once it exists, people will rush towards it in droves – has long been established thinking. \nThe latest example of building in expectation is the new tourist project being created in Bosnia and Herzegovina by a Dubai company. Buroj Property Development has signed a €4.5billion (£3.3billion) contract to carve out an enclave of hotels, homes, retail malls, and even a hospital, in Trnovo. Work is due to begin in April. With a population of 3.8 million that is 40 per cent Muslim, this little Balkan country is of increasing interest to investors and holidaymakers in the Middle East, and the Buroj site is not a lone example. A Saudi firm is currently fomenting a nest of villas in the hills above the capital Sarajevo. \nOnce completed, both places will join a line-up of destinations that were born purely as sunny havens for those seeking a week’s relaxation – rather than rising slowly from the soil as organic communities (in the way that, say, London, New York and Paris emerged), or as the point where two roads cross (a crossroads, if you will). \nOf course, the theory often runs that such “artificial” locations are nothing more than concrete carbuncles with no soul, sophistication or style. \nBut as the list below shows, while some of these “fake” dots on the map might appeal to only the most intrepid of globe-trotters, they tend to share one thing in common – a desperate desire for you to visit them. \nThe Mexican resort of Cancun did not even exist until 1970 (Photo: AP) Cancun, Mexico \nFew destinations have been designed for tourism quite as nakedly as this Caribbean hotspot at the north-east corner of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. \nAlmost nothing existed in the area – beyond pristine beachfront and tropical forest – when ground was first broken in 1970. The official population of Cancun at the time was just three people, and the Mexican government was forced to finance the first nine hotels in the hope of attracting visitors to an area whose economy was largely based on fishing. \nThe scheme definitely worked. Fast forward 45 years, and Cancun is home to over 200 hotels , as well as a population of 723,000 – while its growth has had a knock-on effect further south, transforming the former village of Playa del Carmen into the centrepoint of the “Riviera Maya”, with its luxury resorts and golf courses. \nAll is not lost to unashamed merriment, however – the close-clustered Mayan citadels of Chichen Itza, Tulum and Coba all provide windows on the region’s heritage, if you can pull yourself away from the beach. \nHow to do it \nScott Dunn (020 3627 4862; scottdunn.com ) offers escapes to the five-star Nizuc Resort & Spa in Cancun – a secluded property with six restaurants, a large spa and a snorkel-friendly house reef. Seven-night holidays cost from £1,926 per person (based on two sharing) – including international flights, breakfast and transfers. \nAtlantic City was built to attracto tourists south from New York (Photo: AP) Atlantic City, USA \nThis gaudy chunk of mega-hotels on the New Jersey shore has always been viewed as a solid choice if you want an unfussy week on America’s east coast – mainly because it was suggested as such in the mid-19th century. \nDeliberately set up as a holiday haven in a bid to lure Manhattanites south from New York , it crept into existence in 1853 when its first hotel, The Belloe House, opened its doors. The road arrived in 1870 – the same year that the city’s iconic Boardwalk was laid out along the sand. By 1874, half a million people a year were descending by train on what, two decades earlier, had been a bare landscape. \nAtlantic City has been through many booms and busts ever since. It garnered a reputation for being none too bothered about the ban on alcohol during the Prohibition years (1919-1933) – a period which saw the ascent of gangster Enoch “Nucky” Johnson (played on the TV screen with aplomb by Steve Buscemi in the series Boardwalk Empire ). In 1976, it embraced casino gambling as its prime attraction – and the ker-ching of slot machines rang out across the sands. It is now seen as something of a faded relic, but if you want an unpretentious week on the beach a short hop from the Big Apple (New York is 130 miles and two hours to the north), Atlantic City still delivers. \nHow to do it \nA seven-night break at the four-star Caesars Atlantic City – including breakfast, transfers and flights to Philadelphia from Heathrow on November 21 – costs from £888 per person (two sharing). Book with Expedia (020 3684 2907; expedia.co.uk ). \nLas Vegas was born as a railroad stop - but bloomed as a giant casino (Photo: AP) Las Vegas, USA \nIt seems impossible to imagine anything but a neon-lit metropolis of whirring roulette tables, stretch limousines and Britney Spears residencies, but Las Vegas was once nothing more than a scrap of desert. \nAnd quite recently, too. It scratched out a spot amid the dust of Nevada in 1905, as a tiny stop on the Union Pacific Railroad – and did little for the next three decades, until the legalisation of casino gambling in the state in 1931 saw the city grasp its future. The rest is so much tickertape and glitter – mafia crimelords; Frank Sinatra; the advent of numerous resort-hotels themed around pirates, lost empires and Italian cities. Now Las Vegas markets itself as “the Entertainment Capital of the World”, its regular population of 600,000 swelled by some 40 million visitors every year. \nHow to do it \nVirgin Holidays (0344 557 9266; virginholidays.co.uk ) offers breaks at the four-star Luxor Hotel and Casino – with a seven-night escape, flying from Gatwick on November 21, costing from £978 per person (two people sharing), on a room-only basis. \nThe Palm Jumeirah is one of Dubai's three planned artificial islands (Photo: AP) Dubai, UAE \nThe Middle East’s shiniest city was not always a grand cluster of skyscrapers and sail-shaped hotels. Were you able to time-travel back to the 18th century, you would find nothing more than a fishing village on the Persian Gulf . \nThere were plenty of false starts before it became the global landmark we know today – a fire which reduced Deira to ash in 1894; the collapse of the pearl industry, Dubai ’s then-lifeblood, during the Great Depression of the Thirties. But the modern metropolis began to take shape in 1948, with a wealth of construction under aspirational ruler Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum – and the first hotel arriving in 1959. And even if, strictly, it was the discovery of oil in Dubai’s waters in 1966 which truly sparked its growth – the population soared by 300 per cent between 1968 and 1975 – it has largely gained its fame by being a solid option for guaranteed winter sun . \nIt has certainly embraced the mantra of ‘If you build it, he will come’ since the turn of the millennium – particularly in the form of Palm Jumeirah, the artificial island confected as a sparkling curve of palatial residences and top-end accommodation between 2001 and 2007. Now home to over 30 hotels, this flight of fancy ranks as the largest man-made isle on the planet – even if this lingering status owes everything to the downing of tools on Palm Jebel Ali and Palm Deira, the sibling off-shore projects whose adjacent constructions were put on hold during the financial turbulence of 2008. Both will eclipse the Palm Jumeirah, in both size and scope, should they finally be completed. \nHow to do it \nThomas Cook Signature (01733 224 808; thomascook.com ) sells breaks at the five-star Anantara Dubai The Palm Resort (on Palm Jumeirah). A seven-night holiday, flying from Heathrow on November 21, costs from £1609 a head – including breakfast. \nAwaza has been built at vast expense on the edge of the Caspian Sea (Photo: AP) Awaza, Turkmenistan \nSome “tourist cities” are a triumph of ambition over financial sense. This colossal resort, pitched amid the vast space of central Asia, may yet prove itself to be a jewel on the Caspian Sea. But it is hard to see when it will ever justify the £884 million it took to build – at the behest of Turkmenistan’s “forceful” president Gurbanguly Berdimukhamedov. Tucked eight miles south of the unlovely city of Turkmenbashi, Awaza throws out a range of extravagant hotels, fringed by a five-mile canal. \nIt will, however, have to overcome one sizeable problem if it is to establish itself as a prime beach hotspot. Even at the height of summer, the Caspian Sea is too cold for swimming. \nHow to do it \nCox & Kings (020 7873 5000; coxandkings.co.uk ) includes Awaza – one night at the Seyrana Hotel – in its 10-day “Discover Turkmenistan” tour (available as a group or private journey, from £2295, including flights). The route offers a wider look at Turkmenistan, stopping at the capital Ashgabat, as well as the Martian landscape of the Yangykala Canyon and the staggering sight that is the Darvaza Crater – a collapsed cavern, otherwise known as “The Door To Hell”, where natural gas burns in plain sight. \nBaiae was one of Ancient Rome's favourite resorts - and still exists (Picture: Alamy) Baiae, Italy \nThe purpose-built tourist destination existed as long as two millennia ago. Go back 2,000 years, and the Bay of Naples was host to a resort area where the rich of ancient Rome came to strip off their sandals and snooze on the shore. Julius Caesar and Nero both had properties in Baiae – as did Hadrian, who liked the area so much that he died there, in his villa, in AD138. \nBaiae sprouted as a place of holiday hedonism and scandal – the first century writer Seneca the Younger described it as a “harbour of vice”. It fell from view when Roman lost its mojo in the fifth century, and plunged into anonymity. Literally. While fragments of Baiae can still be seen on land – notably the splendid Temple of Echo – most of the town is now underwater, consigned to the waves by volcanic tremors in this famously fractious area. \nThe ruins are protected as the Underwater Archaeological Park of Baiae ( parcoarcheologicosommersodibaia.it ) – a guardian angel which offers guided scuba visits to this vanished realm. Dives down to the Nymphaeum – a sub-aqua wonder where marble statues, mosaics and tributes to the Gods still litter the seabed – start at €35. \nHow to do it \nCity-break specialist Kirker Holidays (020 7593 1899; kirkerholidays.com ) offers three-night escapes to the five-star Grand Hotel Vesuvius in central Naples – from £692 per person (based on two sharing), including flights, private transfers and breakfast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:38:59.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
