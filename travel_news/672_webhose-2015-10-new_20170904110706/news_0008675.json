The newly renovated Six Senses Samui is ideal for a pampered vacation After two months of extensive renovations, Six Senses Samui recently re-opened with a much more youthful and contemporary look. Located on the northern-most headland of the island, the resort, which has been up and running since 2004, has retained its close-to-nature décor but added a brighter and polished chic to its villas, which are scattered over the lush, tropical landscape. The dark wood décor in all 66 villas has been replaced with lighter and warmer shades of rich, creamy brown that amplifies the natural light and brightens up the room. The oversized cushions are now dressed in bright green upholstery and rustic cabinets and furniture have been polished to contemporary stylishness. The thick and bushy panels that made the outdoor shower a little too dark have also gone and now it's a bright and airy area to enjoy a leisurely shower, with just enough green to prevent it from feeling too exposed. The newly fitted wall-to-ceiling glass walls in the bathroom make the room appear bigger and let in more natural light. Most importantly, it makes you feel closer to nature yet private and secluded in the lush garden. Gone too is that annoying board of light switches that guests would systematically curse as they flicked through a dozen switches one by one trying to find the one that applied to a particular light. Now the lights are clustered, with one switch controlling several lights, making it easier to adjust the lighting. The villa pools have been resurfaced with turquoise stone tiles and an additional seven have been built, giving the resort 59 villas with private pools. The public areas have also undergone renovations. The lobby is more modern but still retains Six Senses wooden flair. The library is more spacious and has been equipped with new reading material, floor-to-ceiling bookcases, games tables and suspended relaxation nets. There's also a \"jungle gym\" in the woods where you can get some fresh air while exercising. The resort serves some of the best regional and international cuisine on the island, especially at the renowned Dining on the Rock, perched on a hill and offering a panoramic view of the ocean. Expect some inspiring new menus from the newly appointed Guatemalan chef de cuisine Giancarlo Caffaro who mixes and matching ingredients from all over the world in his culinary creations. With the secluded location a mere 15 minutes drive from the airport, Six Senses Samui is an ideal choice for vacationers wishing to take in the healing power of nature. A stay here offers more than spa pampering and gazing at the ocean though: the resort offers activities for both kids and adults throughout the day, including a yoga session that doesn't start too early, non-motorised water sport activities and Thai cooking classes. The spot doesn't boast a long stretch of beach but there is a gigantic infinity pool that blends seamlessly with the ocean. And for those wanting some high-powered nightlife, Chaweng Beach and the famed Fisherman's Village are not far away. While Six Senses Samui is recommended for couples and families with older children, the plethora of steps and hilly paths make it difficult to get around for senior guests or those using wheelchairs. AT A GLANCE High points: Conveniently located just 15 minutes from the airport, the hotel offers comfortable, spacious rooms with unobstructed view of the ocean. The food and spa are excellent. Low points: Limited access to the beach. Not ideal for senior guests or wheelchair users. Pay for it: Check the website for the best deals and promotions.
