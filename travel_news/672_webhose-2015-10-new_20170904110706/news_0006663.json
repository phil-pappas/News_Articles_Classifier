An acclaimed hotel owner with her own portfolio of independently owned hotels – Hotel Tresanton in Cornwall and Hotel Endsleigh in Devon, she is renowned for her design influence and loving restoration of hotels.\nShe said: “Our business is not an easy one and I am particularly proud to win this award from the Independent Hotel Show. It is a lovely award to achieve, especially because it has been voted for by so many people in all areas of our business – hoteliers, manufacturers and suppliers. It is a real plus to know that I have been acknowledged and I am delighted.”\nOutstanding New Hotel winner Hotel Gotham was opened in April 2015, by the Bespoke Hotels group. The Grade II listed Art Deco building sits on King Street, and features 60 guestrooms, the 68-cover Honey restaurant and private members bar Club Brass.\nJeff Ward, managing director of Hotel Gotham, said: “Receiving this award is probably the biggest pat on the back for a job well done. I came into the team back in November and we opened in April. We’ve just won the best award I could have won in such a short period of time”\nThe awards were presented by Alison Dolan, deputy managing director of Sky Business and sponsors of the year’s awards, and Peter Hancock, CEO of Pride of Britain Hotels.\nPeter Hancock said: “The Independent Hotel Show is recognising the efforts of real entrepreneurs, people who have taken risks to build up a business and have excelled despite all the economic difficulties. Obviously one feels sorry for the nominees that didn’t win – equal in stature in my opinion – but what a joy to be part of this occasion and a beautifully organised show.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:44:00.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
