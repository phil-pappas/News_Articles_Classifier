I remember my first flight -- New York to London on Pan Am in the early 1970s. My sister and I were dressed up, complete with hats, purses and gloves. Our New York cousins were also dressed up when they came to JFK Airport to see us off. Below are some photos I found on my Pinterest board, The Golden Age of Travel .\nAnd please follow my travel-related magazines on Flipboard: Best of About Travel , a joint curation venture with my fellow About Travel Experts; and Travel-Go! There's Nothing Stopping You , all about the passenger experience on the ground and in the air. You can also find my travel-related boards on Pinterest and follow me on Twitter at @AvQueenBenet .\n1.

There are actual curtains on the aircraft window and the seats sport those autumn colors that were so popular in that decade. More »\nPhoto courtesy of the Daily Beast 3. Service with a smile A couple enjoys service with a smile on an Air France flight, from the 1950s. Check out that amazing spread! More »\nPhoto courtesy of the Argonauticos Tumblr 4. Take Two Seats Can you imagine being able to fold down the seat next to you for extra space to hold your food, drinks and other sundry items on your next flight? It was possible in the 1960s.

He took a Pan Am Boeing 314 flying boat from Miami to Casablanca, Morocco, via stops in Trinidad and Brazil. More »\nPhoto courtesy of rchappo2002 via Flickr 6. Jet Setter United Airlines wanted to show off its new four-engine Douglas DC-8 jet with this ad. That seat is almost loveseat-like, and the large windows gave you a great view. The jet went into service for United on September 18, 1959. More »\nPhoto courtesy of the State Library and Archives of Florida 7. Hats Off! These ladies are sitting aboard a Pan Am Boeing 307, circa between 1940 and 1947. The four-engined 307 had sleeping compartments and a pressurized cabin. The aircraft could carry 33 passengers in day flights and 25 at night, offering full course meals and dressing rooms. More »\nPhoto courtesy of North Carolina Modernist Houses 8. TWA Flight Center This is the iconic home of TWA at John F. Kennedy Airport's Terminal 5. I had the chance to explore the terminal on a TWA flight I took to Tel Aviv in 1997.

Time for Bed This woman is preparing for bed onboard a Boeing Stratocruiser. The aircraft set a new standard for luxurious air travel with its tastefully decorated extra-wide passenger cabin and gold-appointed dressing rooms. A circular staircase led to a lower deck beverage lounge, and flight attendants prepared hot meals for 50 to 100 people in a state-of-the-art galley. As a sleeper, the Stratocruiser was equipped with 28 upper-and-lower bunk units. Information courtesy of Boeing . More »\nImage courtesy of Dovima2010, via Flickr 10.

Party on the Plane The date of this flight is unknown, but if I were guessing, I'd say it was the 1950s based on the clothing. It looks like it was the cocktail hour aboard this flight.

The first of the type was delivered to Eastern Air Lines in April 1972. It could carry up to 250 passengers from coast to coast and featured glare-resistant windows, full-sized hideaway closets for coats, and a below-deck galley, which lifted filet mignon and lamb chop dinners up to the main cabin via two elevators. It also had extra-wide aisles and overhead bins. History courtesy of Lockheed Martin .
