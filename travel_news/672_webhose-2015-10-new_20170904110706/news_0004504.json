An expanded Heathrow will transform the airport experience for Scottish passengers with new world-class terminal facilities, minimum connection times falling to as little as 45 minutes and the additional capacity to improve resilience and reliability. \nHeathrow would be supported by business groups and airports across Scotland: There is huge and growing support in Scotland for Heathrow expansion, with Scottish Chambers of Commerce, SCDI, CBI Scotland and Aberdeen, Glasgow and Inverness airports backing our plans. Heathrow expansion is also supported by Trade Unions with the TUC, GMB, UNITE and BALPA all backing the plans. \nIn addition, new figures from independent research company QUOD show that Heathrow expansion would prove a boost to the Scottish manufacturing sector which would be spurred on by the creation of up to 7,000 new skilled jobs. As well as being an export industry which will benefit significantly from improved trade links, the Scottish manufacturing sector will benefit directly from Heathrow’s expansion programme as the airport sources materials and services to build the a new runway and terminal facilities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:37:54.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
