The CAPA awards for Excellence are independently researched by CAPA and Heidrick & Struggles and selected by an independent International panel of judges.\nEthiopian was selected by the judging panels for its ability to establish pan-African operations and thrive in an increasingly important emerging market; being the biggest standout strategically during the year and emerging as the leader in Africa with a pioneering strategy, which has the greatest impact on the development of the airline industry thereby establishing itself as a leader, providing a benchmark for others to follow.\nEthiopian Group CEO Tewolde GebreMariam receiving the award from CAPA Executive Chairman Peter Harbison\nMr. Tewolde GebreMariam, Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, remarked while receiving the award at a gala dinner, “I am humbled to be honored with this prestigious award of CAPA Airline of the Year which is a demonstration and recognition of our fast and continuous growth, outstanding performance and our Pan-African stance in bringing Africa together and closer to the world. I wish to thank CAPA and the panel of judges for recognizing our contribution in serving Africa and our contribution to the development of the African Aviation.The award goes, first and foremost, to the more than 9000 employees at Ethiopian who are working hard day-in and day-out and managed to make our beloved airline the leading, fast growing and the most profitable airline in Africa, despite the uniquely challenging operating environment prevailing in the continent. It is also a testimony of the remarkable success of our Vision 2025 fast, profitable and sustainable growth strategy.\nThe award is also a testimony of the success of our business model, which is the diversified aviation business and which will make Ethiopian the Leading Aviation Group in Africa by 2025.
