Ever since the draw was made in 2012 this was going to befall one of England, Wales or Australia. But the ramifications for the hosts England were always going to be the gravest, when hurled out of their own Rugby World Cup party before the fun has really started, and as the first host nation to exit at the Pool stages in eight global gatherings. • England vs Australia, Rugby World Cup: as it happened It is, without doubt, a catastrophe for English rugby and even for the RWC itself. The party will go on, but it will not be the same. Indeed it will not be as good. The arguments will now rage and rage as to what went wrong and who is to blame. For many it will be Stuart Lancaster and Stuart Lancaster alone. For some that has been the case for some considerable time. Lancaster knows he has fallen short Looking at it now through the black and white lenses mostly used in such situations, those accusations can hardly be described as unnecessarily hysterical. International sport is about results, and Lancaster will know that the results here have been unacceptable and embarrassing. Not just that, England have not actually won anything during Lancaster’s tenure, finishing second in four successive seasons in the Six Nations to add to this spectacular failure on the grandest stage. But should he be sacked? Well, firstly there is the small matter of a long-term contract until 2020, which Lancaster did not actually demand, but one which was given to him and his coaching team by Ian Ritchie, the Rugby Football Union’s chief executive. RFU chief Ian Ritchie may have to go as well When doing so, Ritchie must have considered this scenario, because with Wales and Australia also in the Pool, it was always a possibility. If Lancaster were to go, then so should Ritchie too really. However, amid the inevitable anger, let’s just examine the issues in a little more detail. Firstly that matter of the Pool opponents. Was this not the toughest Pool in RWC history? Yep, of course it was. When the tournament began, the world rankings showed Australia at second, England at fourth and Wales at fifth. Oh, and the seriously dangerous Fiji at ninth. It was quite ludicrous. Australia were too good on Saturday night So it is not as if England have lost to a bunch of mugs. And it is not as if Wales or Australia would have sacked Warren Gatland or Michael Cheika had they been knocked out early either. I am pretty sure of that. Four years ago England limped into the quarter-finals and had actually won the Six Nations beforehand, but that English rugby is in a much better place than it was then, with the off-field scandals and leaked reports that followed, is surely not in question. Lancaster has worked tirelessly to restore the culture and identity of the England rugby team, and has certainly achieved that. But the truth in my eyes is that he has done so with a group of players that in world terms can only be described as average. In Lancaster's defence, England have a lot of average players Pick a British and Irish Lions side today and there would not be one English certainty. This is undoubtedly a side that has had to rely on the collective effort, a side much greater than the sum of its parts. Lancaster has regularly changed his mind about selection, especially in midfield, but in a way that is understandable because England have a lot of players of the same standard, and they are not of the highest standard. That brings with it a natural inconsistency and the temptation to bring in a replacement who might immediately return that position to its original level. It is said in some quarters that Lancaster selected the wrong players, but it is nonsense really. Players outside the squad always become better with every absent day. But in my view not one of those omitted would have made a significant difference. Steffon Armitage is the one everyone will point to, but because of the agreement between the RFU and its clubs, Lancaster could not pick him if he wanted, and he is not a proven Test player anyway. England's head coach could not make his mind up about the midfield England have missed Manu Tuilagi and Dylan Hartley for sure, but their absences were not Lancaster’s fault, whichever way his critics might want to spin it. Under Lancaster England have lost 17 from 45 Tests played. They have certainly not lost to anyone poor, succumbing to New Zealand (five times), South Africa (four), Wales (three), Australia (two), France (two) and Ireland this year, with there only being two heavy defeats - Wales by 27 in 2013 and New Zealand by 23 in the third Test in Hamilton last year. South Africa are the only side not beaten in that time, and England did draw with them away in 2012. England have also defeated New Zealand, something Wales, for instance, have not done. Yes, the expectations for England are greater, and so they should be, given their resources and wealth. ‘Sack ‘em all’ does not have to be the only policy. And I have to say that I have not yet heard one credible name offered as an alternative to Lancaster. Rob Baxter? Jim Mallinder? Please, come on. Good blokes, good coaches, but, despite the mistakes made, why wantonly waste the knowledge and experience Lancaster has accumulated in this period? Owen Farrell (left) and George Ford are bright prospects for the future There is a strong possibility that by the next RWC, England will have some players upon whom greatness could be thrust. Billy Vunipola is only 22, his brother Mako 24. Lancaster now has two excellent Test-match fly halves, in Owen Farrell and George Ford, aged 24 and 22 respectively. Anthony Watson is only 21. Joe Launchbury is 24 and Henry Slade is 22. Maro Itoje, still only 20, will play very soon surely. There was not that abundance of talent when starting out four years ago. There should be a comprehensive review – after what will only be a horrendous week before playing Uruguay next weekend- and if Lancaster does stay, he must surely consider change within his coaching set-up. As for the captaincy, Chris Robshaw has done a commendable job, and I would suggest change there if I could think of a suitable alternative for now (it will be Itoje eventually). That shows how few leaders this team had. That was where this RWC was botched: where the game is played, out on the pitch, not in the stands.
