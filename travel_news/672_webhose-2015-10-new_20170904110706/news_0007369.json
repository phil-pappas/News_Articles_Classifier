Over 600 tourism blue chip companies from some 22 African countries are presently on the members’ roll, credited to Nigel’s tireless efforts to promote ATTA, which is based in UK, as a primary platform for doing business in Africa. \nThe Board of Directors will now start to find a successor for Nigel while he will remain in office. After his retirement from the frontline he is expected to take up a role on the Board or in an advisory capacity for ATTA. \nAs a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, Nigel made his mark in Kenya in his younger days when he was Managing Director of Signet Hotels, which later got sold to become Lonrho Hotels. He served in various top management positions like Wild Africa Safaris, Universal Travel and On Safari Ltd before being appointed CEO of ATTA in May 1994.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:46:19.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
