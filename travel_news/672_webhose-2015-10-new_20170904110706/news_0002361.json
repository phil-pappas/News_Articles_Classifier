Here are five ideas to consider:\n1. Review your bucket list. Check a trip off your wish list while spending time with a grandchild. Are you eager to make it to Machu Picchu, but don’t have any pals willing to travel with you? Do you yearn to take on the big rapids of the grandest canyon? Look no further than the ranks of your family (and their parents) for eager participants. It will make the accomplishment and the memory that much sweeter.\nContact: wildland.com ; oars.com\n2. Share your story. What stokes your fire? A backwoods adventure? A stroll down a historical lane? A visit to the home of golf? Shopping until you drop on Fifth Avenue (or the outlet malls)? Share your passion and experiences with the next generation. Involve the kids in the planning and make sure they know how and why the specific plan has been generated. They will appreciate your vintage approach to the getaway.\nNeed help with the details? Consider a travel agent.\nContact: virtuoso.com\n3. Head to the beach. The sunrise and sunset. Lazy days digging your toes into the sand while building creative castles. A leisurely stroll, searching for shells and well-worn glass. A beach vacation is a great way to blend the interests and abilities of every age group. Opt for a spacious vacation rental to keep the clan close but allow for numerous sleep, nap, snack and dining schedules.\nContact: verobeach.com ; visitflorida.com\n4. Consider a cruise. From the biggest ships to the adventure crafts, multigenerational clans find it appealing to get on board for a seafaring family adventure. Expect high-tech and age-appropriate activities for all the kids, plus plenty of music, shows, spa time, dancing and dining choices for adults. On bigger ships, each family member can choose their own brand of fun for the day and then meet for dinner to share stories at day’s end. Increasingly, cruise ships are designed to accommodate family groups.\nContact: royalcaribbean.com ; uncruise.com\n5. Saddle up on a ranch. Discuss your plan for each day over farm-fresh eggs, bacon and buttery biscuits. Will it be a half-day ride into the back country? An afternoon on the nearby fly-fishing stream? Or a hike into the hills?\nA guest ranch getaway provides a picturesque setting where the generations can learn about horsemanship, spend an afternoon painting by the fire or simply relax on the porch. Turn off the technology and settle into ranch life. More than likely, laughter and good conversations will follow.\nContact: 320ranch.com ; duderanch.org\nLynn O’Rourke Hayes is the editor of familytravel.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:09:03.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
