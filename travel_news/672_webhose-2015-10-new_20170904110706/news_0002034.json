In the current “lower for longer” environment for interest rates – with returns on cash, shares and bonds all suppressed – that sort of yield is normally offered only by highly uncertain investments such as unlisted “mini-bonds”, where your money is tied up with the fortunes of one company. That yield, however, is currently available from an in-demand investment trust – and researchers at Canaccord Genuity, the broker, last week rated it a “buy”. MedicX is one of a small number of trusts that invest solely in “primary healthcare infrastructure”, principally properties let to GP practices and other parts of the NHS. This makes them comparable with property trusts, where managers are seeking returns from rents and capital appreciation on commercial property. Concentrating on healthcare facilities, however, means MedicX behaves differently. “It holds very long-term contracts with the Government for these facilities,” said Alan Brierley of Canaccord. “There won’t be huge capital appreciation but a high proportion of GP surgeries are in need of repair, so demand should stay strong.” These rental contracts enable the dividend to remain remarkably stable, Mr Brierley said, despite it not being covered by earnings. Current dividend cover – the ratio by which net earnings exceed the dividend – is just 0.67. For other types of company, this would set alarm bells ringing about the dividend’s sustainability. Steady return: The chart shows the yield of the MedicX trust versus an property fund index and gilts. The security of contracts with the Government, however, along with lower borrowing costs than peers, makes the dividend affordable, Canaccord said. If you want to buy into the returns offered by MedicX, you will have to accept buying at a large premium – an eye-watering 25pc at current prices. That reflects the high demand for this type of trust. On the methodology used by Canaccord, which takes account of the value of debt, the MedicX premium compares with 58pc for Assura and 68pc for Primary Health Properties, its two peers in the sector. • Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas Investors also face a steep management charge, common among property-based trusts, with total expenses reaching 2.5pc last year. Patrick Connolly, a certified financial planner at Chase de Vere, said ordinary investors should tread carefully and that many might find that such specialist funds represented too much of a risk. He said: “Infrastructure investments can provide steady returns, which makes them well placed to outperform in difficult economic environments when other investments are struggling. “However, it would be wrong to assume that infrastructure investments are without risk. There can be risks related to the construction and operation of infrastructure assets and the potential for economic, regulatory or political risks, all of which could impact on returns.” He said the Henderson UK Property fund offered investors more varied exposure to commercial property. • Read more on investment trust investing in our five golden rules of investing .
