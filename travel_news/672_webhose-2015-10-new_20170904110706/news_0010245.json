Garfield Weston Foundation, will be announced Nov. 14 at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton. \nAs well, the first five Kingston Prize-winning paintings — by artists Mike Bayne, Joshua Choi, Richard Davis, Marcia Perkins and Andrew Valko — are on display at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in Kingston, Ont., until Dec. 6.
