Courtesy Greenwell Farms USA Today has named a Big Island Kona Coffee farm as one of the best to tours in the nation. Greenwell Farms, which spans four generations, was chosen as as one of the 10 Best Food Factory Tours in the United States, chosen by USA Today readers. Grenoble Farms spans four generations. Courtesy Greenwell Farms Greenwell was chosen along with tours offered at Herr’s Snack Factory, TABASCO®, Hershey’s Chocolate World, Celestial Seasonings Tea, PEZ, Jelly Belly and Boudin Bakery. Greenwell beat tours at companies including Ben & Jerry’s, Tillamook Cheese Factory and World of Coca-Cola, which were nominated but did not make a top 10. “There are a lot of really good tours that people can go on [in Kona] so we feel quite honored that ours was chosen,” CFO Steve Hicks said. “We probably have between 100 and 200 people show up each day — that number changes with the visitor count on the Big Island but it has grown for us. It’s a very relaxed kind of tour and I think that’s why it’s popular.” The farm is located along Mamalahoa Highway and is open seven days a week. Free tours are offered from 8:30 a.m. through 4:30 p.m. Greenwell has a staff of 40 to 50 full and part-time employees, and an additional 50 are hired during peak season, Hicks said, as the coffee is harvested by hand. The farm wasn’t originally planning on including an agro-tourism component, but visitor demand led to its introduction in the mid 1990s, he says. “I think many people have no idea about how much goes into processing coffee,” he said. “I think that’s one of the things people are impressed by when they see what we actually have to do from time cherry is picked and pulped and its dried as parchment, and we mill that parchment which turns into green bean, then roast it before its sold to retail.” The Greenwell family arrived in Kona in 1850 and pursued cattle farming and coffee. Grandfather Henry Greenwell was one of the first exporters of Kona coffee, and brought it to the 1873 World’s Fair in Vienna. Tom and Jennifer Greenwell and Hicks and his wife Beth (Greenwell) Hicks continue the family tradition. Hicks says the historical component to the tour is one of the things he believes visitors enjoy. Overall, retail and e-commerce are a smaller portion of business, he said. “The lion’s share of what we do is sell grated green [coffee] beans to wholesale specialty markets around the world,” he said. “We have clientele across the U.S., around the Pacific Rim, and lately a lot into Europe.” The farm exports roughly 30,000 to 35,000 pounds a container across the globe to hundreds of customers. Larger clients include Starbucks, Green Mountain Coffee, and Nescafe in Europe, as well as smaller operations and brokers.
