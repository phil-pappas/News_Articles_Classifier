For his latest title, Nopi: The Cookbook , named for his London fine-dining restaurant, he partnered with head chef Ramael Scully to create 120 recipes of “restaurant food.” Translation: recipes a bit more complex than those on offer in his previous two titles. “What Scully and I have attempted to do is to modify and simplify Nopi’s recipes without losing their essential core,” Ottolenghi writes.\nWhile some recipes—like the confit duck leg with cherry mustard and kohlrabi slaw—are more labor intensive, not all require spending serious time in the kitchen. One of the more simple dishes is actually a perennial Nopi favorite: burrata with blood orange and lavender oil. “Customers come to Nopi for this dish alone. We sell about 1,000 each month!” writes Ottolenghi. “Bittersweet blood oranges have a short season in late winter, but many alternatives have been served at Nopi: white peaches, clementines, pink grapefruit, roasted red grapes, pickled pears, and kohlrabi. Regular oranges, for those who want to keep things simple, also work very well.”\nBurrata With Blood Orange, Coriander Seeds, and Lavender Oil\nServes 4\nIngredients:\n2 T olive oil\n1 1/2 tsp. clear runny honey\n3/4 tsp. dried lavender\n1/2 small clove garlic, crushed\n1 T coriander seeds, toasted\n2 blood oranges (11 oz.) or 2 medium oranges\nInstructions:\n1. Place the oil in a small saucepan with the honey, lavender, garlic, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-low heat and remove at once. Stir well and set aside until completely cool, then add the coriander seeds.\n2. Use a sharp serrated knife to trim the tops and tails off the oranges. Cut down the sides of the oranges, following their natural curve, to remove the skin and white pith. Slice into 8 rounds, 3/4-inch thick, and remove the seeds.\n3. Divide the orange slices between the plates, slightly overlapping, and place a burrata ball alongside. Spoon the coriander seeds and lavender oil over the cheese and orange, top with basil leaves—tearing them as you go—or micro-basil, left whole, and serve.", "external_links": ["http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/nopi-the-cookbook-shop"], "published": "2015-10-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:03:53.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
