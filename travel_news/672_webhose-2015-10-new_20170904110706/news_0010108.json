Photo: WOW Air \nAfter causing a stir stateside with $99 flash sales between the U.S. and Paris and Amsterdam, Icelandic budget carrier WOW Air just announced it would be making the trip across the pond from Iceland to Toronto Pearson and Montreal beginning in May for as low as CDN $99 (about USD $75). WOW isn’t the only budget carrier offering dirt cheap transatlantic flights — Norwegian Air, WestJet and, as of March 2016, Eurowings, are lowering the bottom price of North America-to-Europe flights. Here’s a look at every route these budget carriers are flying: \nWOW Air | WOW can save fliers headed to Europe big bucks if they don’t mind flying through Iceland, but passengers pay the price in time and ancillary fees. London-bound travelers must add an extra 3 to 5 hours to their travel time, once a layover is factored in, and any baggage over 11 pounds will cost you fees between $42 and $60. Connections after the U.S. and Iceland leg are available to cities including London, Paris, Berlin, Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Dublin. For now the only direct routes are: Reykjavik (RKV) to Boston (BOS) Reykjavik (RKV) to Baltimore (BWI) \nNorwegian Air | Norwegian, the third largest budget carrier in Europe offers direct flights between six U.S. cities and four European cities (the three Scandinavian capitals and London). From its European hubs, travelers can move on to dozens of cities across Europe. The airline also recently announced routes between Cork and Boston and New York , launching in May 2016 and some time in 2017, respectively. Meal on the long transatlantic flight will cost you extra, as will bringing baggage aboard. Current direct routes are as follows: Los Angeles (LAX) – Copenhagen (CPH) Los Angeles (LAX)- London (LGW) Los Angeles (LAX) – Oslo (OSL) Los Angeles (LAX) – Stockholm (ARN) Orlando (MCO) – Copenhagen (CPH)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:36:08.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
