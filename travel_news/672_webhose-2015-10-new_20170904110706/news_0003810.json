That was better than the 78.1 per cent mark in July and 77.7 per cent the previous August.\nDelta Air Lines had the best on-time rate, 85.5 per cent, followed by Alaska Airlines at 82.9 per cent.\nSpirit Airlines rated last, with an on-time rate of 63.7 per cent. JetBlue Airways was next to last at 74 per cent. The government counts a flight as on time if it arrives within 14 minutes of schedule.\nComplaints most frequently concern delayed flights, but baggage or ticketing problems, customer service and fares are also included.\nTwo domestic flights in August were stuck on the tarmac longer than three hours, which could trigger violations of federal rules. One was a Delta flight delayed at Orlando, Florida, and the other was a PSA Airlines flight held up at Charlotte, North Carolina. PSA operates US Airways Express flights.\nConsumers filed 1,633 complaints about U.S. airlines with the government, up from 1,107 a year earlier. Spirit had the highest complaint rate by a wide margin. Consumers were nearly twice as likely to complain about Spirit as about Frontier Airlines, the carrier with the second-worst record. Both airlines advertise low fares but charge more fees than most other carriers.\nMany more travellers complain directly to the airlines, so the government report does not fully capture consumer displeasure. The CEO of Frontier Airlines estimated that his company gets 30 complaints for every one filed with the government.\n___\nThe Department of Transportation report can be found at http://1.usa.gov/1NpZ2YP\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:34:11.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
