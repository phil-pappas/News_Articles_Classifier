Of the current one million Japanese visitors to Thailand each year, 70 per cent are men while 70 per cent of Japanese visitors to neighboring Vietnam are women, lured by the spa stays and beauty products there, he pointed out. \n\nPeople walking in Harajuku Station, Tokyo, Japan.

I think we have to develop (this market segment),” he said. \n\nThis will be achieved via targeted marketing through social media and women’s magazines, riding on the momentum from TAT’s Ladies Journey campaign launched at the Japan Association of Travel Agents (JATA) Tourism Expo last month. \n\n“We have to provide more information. We have better quality products. Secondly, we have to improve our image,” said Yuthasak, arguing it was necessary for Thailand to be seen as a value destination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:02:59.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
