(TSX:CP)(NYSE:CP) today announced that it has ratified a transformational multi-year collective agreement with its 450 U.S. engineers represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET).\nThe new hourly-rate agreement brings an end to a mileage-based wage system from the steam engine era and provides CP with increased flexibility and transparency, the employee with a cycle with two consecutive days off and the best wages in the industry.\n\"This negotiated agreement is a major step forward for both parties and represents the biggest win-win that a railway, its employees and operating unions could have,\" said Keith Creel , CP's President and Chief Operating Officer. \"The benefits it will provide to all parties, including - at the center of it all - our customers, are immediate and will build month by month and year by year.\"\nThe agreement - which also gives BLET members the ability to participate in the employee share purchase plan - spans three years with an option for either side to revert to the former agreement if written notice is given prior to the beginning of the third year. If neither party reverts, the agreement is extended for two more years.\n\"Our people are the key to CP's success and they deserve to share in the success of the company,\" Creel said.\nForward Looking Statement\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws relating, but not limited, to the anticipated future benefits of the agreement.
