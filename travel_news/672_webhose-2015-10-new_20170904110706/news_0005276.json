Now, with prices plummeting – sometimes steadily, sometimes sharply – across the commodities spectrum for a fourth consecutive year, other companies are finding themselves in distress. As pressures persist, mining companies will try to renegotiate, restructure and/or reorganise. But, in more than a few instances, the usual remedies won’t be enough and companies will have to resort to drastic measures: they’ll cut costs; curtail capex; sell or spin off assets; freeze other investments; file for bankruptcy; solicit buyers; entertain suitors; reduce or withhold dividends; issue new shares; and otherwise prepare themselves for the worst. Battening down the hatches in “survival mode” no longer cuts it in these markets: decisive and comprehensive action is necessary to survive. “Mining and metals businesses simply cannot sustain themselves when prices are significantly below their costs of staying in business for such a prolonged period of time,” says Rebecca Campbell, a mining and metals partner at White & Case. China’s collapse has compounded concerns about where commodity markets are going – particularly in iron ore and coal “Having made it through the first wave the worse for wear, but more or less intact, mid-size and large companies – including those with prudent management, well-run operations, and successful cost-cutting programmes – are now struggling to survive the sustained stress brought on by the downturn.” Is the worst yet to come? John Tivey, global head of mining and metals at White & Case, warns that “while some companies have been hanging on, China’s collapse has compounded concerns about where commodity markets are going – particularly in iron ore and coal.” Some of these companies are so vulnerable that a sudden liquidity shock could force them from a stressed situation to deep distress. “In August 2015”, explains Ms Campbell, “Alpha Natural Resources lost its qualification to self-bond rehabilitation obligations, and that triggered an immediate US$400m liquidity shock, which was a key factor in its filing for US Chapter 11 bankruptcy.” Despite the general doom and gloom in the mining and metals markets, White & Case believes that some companies will be able to identify and pounce on opportunities brought on by ongoing realignment and reactions to the commodities crisis. “The distressed scenario,” Mr Tivey explains, “will continue to create opportunities to buy assets more cheaply. Discerning buyers will end up dealing with less resistant vendors or even administrators in control of companies and assets.” Only those miners with good assets, sound management, and prudent advice will survive – and maybe someday thrive Providers of new money can potentially make big returns in such situations. These participants – hybrid funds, activist investors, or established mining companies – may put themselves on a path to control the equity of a restructured group. Many have had to take relatively drastic steps just to survive. New World Resources, a company doing big business in the Czech Republic, underwent a successful and well-regarded balance sheet restructuring during the first wave, only to see the mining and metals markets continue to struggle. “Having already acted decisively and comprehensively,” says Ms Campbell, “NWR’s management has had to remain vigilant amid the sustained stress that has battered the industry since prices plummeted in 2013.” “Many miners will have to do just that for now and the foreseeable future”, adds Mr Tivey. “Miners are back on the grind: they’ll have to scrape for a living in what has again become a low-margin, high-risk business. \"Only those with good assets, sound management, and prudent advice will survive – and maybe someday thrive.” Read more of White & Case’s current thinking on mining and metals , including Mining & Metals: Weathering the Storm No More published to coincide with LME week, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:42:50.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
