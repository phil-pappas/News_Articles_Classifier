( http://pyrogenesis.com ) (TSX-V: PYR) (OTCQB: PYRNF), a TSX Venture 50® clean-tech company (the \"Company\" or \"PyroGenesis\") that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes plasma waste-to-energy systems and plasma torch products, announced today that it will be producing specialty powders for the Additive Manufacturing industry, specifically for 3D printing.\nPyroGenesis' Plasma Atomization Process (PAP) is an enabling technology for 3D Printing as well as other additive manufacturing and powder metallurgy applications. PyroGenesis' technology has the distinction of producing highly flowable and very pure spherical metallic powders, all highly sought after characteristics in additive manufacturing applications.\nAs previously announced, PyroGenesis filed a provisional patent for this PAP. This new process enables PyroGenesis to produce metallic powders at higher production rates while, at the same time, allowing for better control of powder size distribution. The need to produce powders of a specific particle size distribution at increasingly higher production rates is driven by the growing demand created by the additive manufacturing industry, particularly 3D printing.\n\"While delivering the first of ten (10) Plasma Atomization Systems to a client, an opportunity arose to test certain parameters which PyroGenesis identified as having the potential of improving both the production rate and purity of the powders,\" said P. Peter Pascali , President and CEO of PyroGenesis. \"The decision was taken, with the customer, to strategically delay delivering the first system to allow for this testing. This strategic delay not only resulted in a patent application by PyroGenesis, but paved the way for PyroGenesis to consider producing powder for 3D printing on its own.\"\nPyroGenesis has already identified customers interested in procuring PyroGenesis powders, though not in the quantity that would justify the purchase of a Plasma Atomization System. With a total investment of $1 .7MM, PyroGenesis could be producing specialty powders within nine (9) months. It is estimated that PyroGenesis could generate over $10MM profit per year per system from powder sales alone. As such, PyroGenesis has decided to enter this market and is in the process of securing the funds to finance such a build. This first system would also be used to develop next generation Plasma Atomization Systems capable of making powders from various metals being used in 3D printing, as well as from composites.\nAbout PyroGenesis Canada Inc.\nPyroGenesis Canada Inc., a TSX Venture 50® clean-tech company, is the world leader in the design, development, manufacture and commercialization of advanced plasma processes.
