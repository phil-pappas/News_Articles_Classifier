They will also feature an advanced in-flight entertainment experience powered by the next generation of large-format tablets and equipped with a telescoping tablet arm that adjusts to optimize viewing angle and comfort. \nHawaiian worked with West Coast-based brand and design consultancy PaulWylde to translate the airline´s signature design language, rooted in the natural colors and forms of the island landscape, into the cabin experience. The cabin design will incorporate flowing curves evocative of the winds and ocean, while marrying organic textures, pops of bright saturated color, and luxury materials like leather from Poltrona Frau. \nHawaiian, PaulWylde and Optimares collaborated intensively to ensure the seat and cabins are uniquely tailored to the needs of the Hawaii traveler. The seats will be installed in a 2-2-2 configuration ideally suited for couples and families traveling to the beautiful Hawaiian Islands. \nToday, Hawaiian´s wide-body, twin-aisle Airbus 330-200 aircraft seat 294 passengers, with 18 in Business/First Class, 40 in Extra Comfort and 236 in the Main Cabin. In the new configuration, the aircraft will seat 278 passengers, with 18 in Business/First Class, 68 in Extra Comfort and 192 in the Main Cabin. Seat pitch in the Main Cabin will remain a roomy 31 inches. \nNow in its 86th year of continuous service, Hawaiian is Hawai´i´s biggest and longest-serving airline, as well as the largest provider of passenger air service from its primary visitor markets on the US Mainland. It is a subsidiary of Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: HA).  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:27:00.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
