(CxGBS), the well-respected Holistic Commissioning ® consultancy group for high-performance buildings, is proud to have national politicians and international diplomats visit the new U.S. Diplomacy Center construction site.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276455\nThe U.S. Diplomacy Center (USDC) is an addition to the Harry S. Truman Building, the headquarters for the U.S. State Department. The USDC will serve as a museum and educational center, highlighting U.S. diplomacy and the vital role it has played throughout the nation's history. The Center will, with thought-provoking exhibits and dynamic programs, bring the rich story of U.S. diplomacy to life. Visitors can explore the ways global relationships impact the present and shape the future, gain insight into the responsibilities of the Department of State and learn the compelling stories of U.S. diplomats.\nA section of the infamous Berlin Wall has been incorporated into the building. The Berlin Wall became a tangible symbol of the Cold War when it was constructed in 1961, sealing off free passage between East and West Berlin for almost 30 years. When the Wall came down in late 1989, it was the visual personification of modern diplomacy at work. The installation drew an influential crowd; attendees included dignitaries from Germany , as well as several noted U.S. politicians and the Honorable John F. Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State.\nCxGBS® is providing Holistic Commissioning ® services that include building enclosure and energy consuming systems for the USDC. The company began the project in pre-design and assisted with developing the owner's project requirements, commissioning design reviews, and is currently commissioning the building systems during the project's construction phase. How does it feel to have so much attention given to one of their projects? HJ Enck, CxGBS Co-founder, explained, \" We are thrilled to be involved in something so significant. It is an honor to be a part of the amazing team that is designing and constructing the USDC – and humbling to know our group will play a role in preserving history for future generations .\"\nTo learn more about the U.S. Diplomacy Center visit diplomacy.state.gov\nAbout CxGBS\nFounded in 2002, by H.
