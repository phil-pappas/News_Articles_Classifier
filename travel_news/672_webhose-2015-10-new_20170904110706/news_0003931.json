The first fitting is the wing on Airwheel S5. Airwheel S5 is transformed into the foldable shaft-equipped scooter. USA, 20 October 2015 -- Two-wheeled intelligent scooter S5 was launched by Airwheel Technology in the sixth month of the year 2015, along with another electric self-balancing scooter A3. Airwheel S5 was regarded as a modified version of S3 and positioned it as the personal all-terrain vehicle. Although some elements of its predecessor S3 retained in S5, some considerate fittings on S5 makes it stand out from other models.The first fitting is the wing on Airwheel S5. Since Airwheel intelligent self-balancing scooter S5 is hailed as the personal all-terrain vehicle, it has to pass several tough terrains like muddy paths and craggy paths. When Airwheel S5 negotiates the muddy paths, the muddy water is pretty easy to splash over the main body of Airwheel S5. The muddy water may permeate through the shell of S5 and thereby does harm to its inner component parts, which will cause the decrease in performance and even mechanical breakdown. The side-mounted wing on Airwheel is a big help to shield S5 from muddy water. Airwheel electric unicycles like X3 and X8 boast their portability and ease to store, notably because of their conveniently small size. Unfortunately, Airwheel S3 does not retain the merit. Its long shaft needs for more store space so that the boot of the private car cannot fit it. In view of this fact, Airwheel S5 is transformed into the foldable shaft-equipped scooter. The owner could fold its shaft to scale the volume of the body so as to conveniently put electric scooter into the boot. From the perspective of safety, Airwheel intelligent self-balancing scooter S5 is outfitted with two headlights on its two sides for ride at night. On the poorly illuminative path, ride is rather potentially dangerous. In order to guarantee the safety of the rider, Airwheel installed two headlights on its two sides for intensifying the illumination. These considerate designs bring a guarantee of safety as well as the enjoyment of ride.
