Whoever it carries, its managing director Jonathan Dow is clear on one thing: “Safety is the most important aspect of our business. It is absolutely critical to our success.” Mr Dow explains his company’s approach to road safety, in order to identify best practice that can be built on by other fleet operators, even if they’re not employing professional drivers. How big is Club Class Chauffeurs' fleet? We operate 50 cars, and they are all driven by chauffeurs who we employ. That is an important part of our approach: it is the way we look after our drivers, and keep them as safe as possible on the road. Why does employing chauffeurs keep them safer? It means we can guarantee the hours they work, ensuring we meet European Driving Guidelines and are mindful of our drivers’ physical abilities. Some are able to drive longer distances than others, and it’s important to honour the differences between them. By employing our chauffeurs, we are able to invest in their training from the word go. Each new driver completes a three-month probationary period, and our buddying system helps them to learn the trade from their peers. Thereafter, we conduct annual appraisals, with a clear focus on the need to maintain safety standards. We select cars which aim to put our drivers and clients out of harm's way We also offer a suite of NVQs and other industry qualifications from organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA). This ensures we have an objective measure of our workforce’s achievements. A final benefit of employing drivers is that we can guarantee them a certain number of hours of work each week. As a result, they do not have to take on piecemeal part-time work to secure their income, and we can be confident that they will be fresh and alert when they get behind the wheel of our cars. What other strategies do you adopt to enhance fleet safety? One of the big things is our choice of fleet vehicles. We choose Volvo because of its market-leading reputation for safety. By putting our drivers and clients in cars that will actively keep them out of harm’s way, we significantly reduce the risk of them being involved in an accident. Of course, we also need to look after the drivers themselves. With this in mind, we pay for overnight accommodation when they have a long distance to cover the next day. This gives them a good opportunity to rest before their shift gets underway, and is a good strategy for any company that requires its staff to complete long journeys as part of their work. We also use Trakm8 vehicle tracking technology across our fleet, along with technology that gives a visual representation of how well a car is being driven. Green is good, amber is acceptable, and red means poor. Moreover, an alarm sounds if the speed limit is exceeded by more than 10pc. How has Club Class Chauffeurs benefited from such careful attention to driver safety? Our repair bills have reduced, because our cars are involved in fewer accidents as a result of both driver training and the safety equipment on our fleet of Volvos. That also reduces down-time, enhances productivity, and improves staff morale. What is more, our safety record makes a good impression on clients, bringing them reassurance that they’re in good hands. By encouraging more eco-friendly driving, we’ve saved £54,000 per year on our fuel bill. We split this saving 50-50 with our chauffeurs, giving them every incentive to maintain their good habits. In summary, what are the three most important aspects of driver safety in a business like yours? 1) People: you need to work with outstanding staff, who share your commitment to safety 2) Fleet: choose cars from a leading manufacturer such as Volvo, and you can be confident they are safe, reliable and comfortable 3) Training and maintenance: train your drivers and support them to stay safe. Also ensure your fleet is kept in impeccable condition. Your fleet in safe hands Whatever the size of your fleet, it pays to put driver safety at the top of your priority list. Not only does this ensure your people are kept out of harm’s way while they travel on business. It also brings cost savings and protects you from legal action if an accident does happen. Volvo Car UK is renowned as a world-leader in vehicle safety. It has teamed up with driver safety and risk management specialist Fleet21 and work-related road safety advocate Driving for Better Business to help employers enhance the safety of their fleets. The initiative is called Co-Pilot, and it provides Volvo fleet customers with all the support needed to ensure the safety of their workforce on the road. Co-Pilot members make use of Fleet 21’s expertise to ensure they comply with their legal duty of care to fleet drivers. They also have access to a variety of discounts and special offers from Co-Pilot partners such as Specsavers, Roadhawk (which is owned by Trakm8) and Romex.
