The Twitter website, Tweetdeck - its service for power users, and its mobile apps were all down at 14:14 BST on Thursday. Service was restored roughly 10 minutes later. The website Down Detector , which registers reports of outages, registered a huge spike in queries for Twitter being down. Users in the UK, Japan, the US and the Middle East were among those affected. Twitter down detector Photo: Down Detector In its earlier days, Twitter had several maintenance issues, with the dreaded \"fail whale\" being a common occurrence , although the service has become significantly more reliable in recent years. \"Something is technically wrong,\" a notice on the Twitter website said. \"Thanks for noticing - we're going to fix it up and have things back to normal soon.\" Here are searches for \"Twitter down\" in the last hour in the UK. Twitter's service page was not displaying any information about the outage. When everything was back to normal, Twitter reacted as usual.

My daughter started school! — Damien Owens (@OwensDamien) October 15, 2015 Phew. Twitter was down and I had nowhere to tweet about it. — Martin Bryant (@MartinSFP) October 15, 2015 Twitter was down briefly, and no one on Facebook noticed or complained. I felt so alone. — Lane (@heylookatlane) October 15, 2015 I think this is referring to Twitter having to share its CEO with another company. pic.twitter.com/gEBB1TB4Mg — Ivan the K™ ?
