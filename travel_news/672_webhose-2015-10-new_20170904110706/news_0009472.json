Picture: CIRCA Related articles Stanlib keeps eye on Africa after deal in Ghana Stanlib eyes new clients with offering INVESTMENT bank Stanlib is set to launch East Africa’s first Income Real Estate Investment Trust (I-Reit).\nThe Fahari I-Reit will be listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange, allowing South African investors indirectly to own a slice of Kenya’s property market. This is attractive given that SA’s economy is struggling to grow, while Kenya’s is performing well.\nProperty is heading for a boom as an asset class in Kenya, according to Stanlib. The country is benefiting from strong economic growth, with Kenya’s gross domestic product climbing 5.3% last year.\nAn I-Reit owns and manages income-generating real estate for the benefit of its investors. An I-Reit is legally obligated to distribute 80% of net income to investors.\nThe trust will invest in properties and pay clients returns at an agreed rate.\n\"The Stanlib I-Reit will be pioneering the Reit structure in Kenya by providing local and international investors with a safe and a regulated investment structure that also presents a diversification opportunity into a new asset class. This should bode well for the real estate market, with price discoveries and more listings in the region,\" Stanlib head of listed property Keillen Ndlovu said.\nStanlib head of direct property investments Amelia Beattie said the Reit was expected to have a market capitalisation of about 12.5-billion Kenyan shillings (R1.61bn). Stanlib would be asset manager for the fund, which would be unitised.\nThe unit holders were the \"ultimate owners of the Stanlib Fahari I-Reit\".\nJHI Properties Kenya, a specialist property manager, will provide property management functions in respect of the Reit’s properties.\nBut some analysts view African Reits as too risky.\n\"The Stanlib Kenyan I-Reit is not something that we are too positive about at the moment. Our house view is that we are not seeing returns in many African markets justifying the risk, and we believe that other international markets present far more attractive Reit investment opportunities,\" Alternative Real Estate Capital Management’s Garreth Elston said.\n\"The main issue we have with many African markets outside of SA is that the investments can be quite illiquid; property valuations are often based on a shallow pool of comparable assets and you can’t be sure that you are getting an accurate valuation or not; and quite often foreign investors entering these markets skew them to the point where they risk becoming the market, further obfuscating the valuations.\n\"We see much better Reit value in North America, Europe and the UK,\" Mr Elston said.\nStanlib Kenya is the third-largest Kenyan asset manager. Stanlib has assets worth more than $2.3bn under management in East Africa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:23:45.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
