Shareholders, visitors, and global travelers alike, can officially begin using the unique dual database platform, to access over 125,000 hotels around the world, in addition to those Central American-Caribbean properties signing exclusively with the region’s new OTA.\n“This is by far the biggest day in Pure’s history,” stated Melvin Pereira, President and CEO of Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc. “We have been working diligently for quite some time and are beyond excited for our OTA to undergo beta testing by the general public. We are launching right out of the gate, initiating Oveedia beta testing with an inventory of 125,000 hotels from around the world. We intend to ramp that up, while focusing on quickly integrating an exclusive database of thousands of properties throughout Central America and the Latin countries of the Caribbean, which are not listed on any other OTA in the market.”\nIn initiating Oveedia beta testing, it has not been an easy road for the Company. Along the way however, PURE managed to grab a few wins that favorably positioned the Company for today’s Oveedia beta launch.\nThe engagement of Softon ITG to accelerate product development, receiving Sabre’s prestigious Pseudo City Code (PCC) and becoming a member of Sabre’s $7 Billion Travel Network family, seeing an increase in capital commitment to ramp-up coding, and an early transitioning of Oveedia to Rackspace, all helped to set the stage for what management heralds today, as an epic event for PURE. And, with the ability to add on 400 airlines, 16 cruise lines and more than 25 car rental agencies, once the basic system has been tested during the shaping process, in addition to Oveedia’s own exclusive regional database, management expects Oveedia to become a formidable force within the $34 Billion (anticipated 2016) Latin American online travel market.\nPeople who are interested in exploring Oveedia, should visit the official website at www.Oveedia.com, any time after 2:30 PM (CT) today. In initiating Oveedia beta testing, though a vast amount of web traffic is expected, with Oveedia being hosted on Rackspace, management anticipates a very successful launch.\nPereira concluded, “It goes without saying, that we would not be where we are today, without our long-time supporters and shareholders. As we look to transition from beta to Oveedia 1.1, we ask that everyone test Oveedia, find the flaws or good points, and send their comments to us. The end-user is always our number one priority. Every comment will be reviewed and changes will be implemented accordingly.”\nSource:- Pure Hospitality", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:21:25.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
