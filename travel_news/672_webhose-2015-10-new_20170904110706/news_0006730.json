The perfect opportunity to try delectable dishes and exchange with the starred chef about the spirit of his dishes, his culinary universe and how Air France has inspired him.\nFRANÇOIS ADAMSKI, THE NEW STAR OF FRENCH GASTRONOMIC CUISINE\nStarting in October 2015, François Adamski, Meilleur Ouvrier de France (MOF) (France’s best craftsman in cuisine, 2007) and winner of the Bocuse d’Or (2001), will offer his creations on board Air France’s long and medium-haul Business cabins. The chef earned his reputation through a discreet and unrelenting application to his art. Originally from the north of France, he has become one of the most outstanding disciples of French classic cuisine, concocting a deceptively simple, intricate cuisine where every detail counts. He owes his perfect command of techniques to the culinary greats including Michel Roth and Eric Briffard, his first mentors. He has subsequently successfully demonstrated his skills throughout France. This culinary flair has undoubtedly inhabited him since his early years, especially since his mother had exerted a taste for beautiful things on her son, and a love of finely-fragranced, good food. With two Michelin stars awarded in Bourges and Bordeaux, he now runs his own establishment in the South West of France, the new hub of modern fine cuisine, where he signs the menus for prestigious restaurants. He reveals the secret of his art to Air France customers – a simple and authentic cuisine, with genuine flavor but always inventive.\nTrue to his commitments, François Adamski is also the President of Team France Bocuse d’Or, the association which supports the French candidate and of which Air France and Servair are Premium partners.\nAIR FRANCE AND THE ART OF FINE FRENCH CUISINE\nAir France is committed to promoting French haute cuisine in all its cabin classes. With a unique legacy, the Company is continuing a tradition that values excellence, pleasure and exclusivity. Since 2011, Air France has entrusted one dish from the Business Class menu to a renowned French chef. Joël Robuchon, Guy Martin, Michel Roth, Thibaut Ruggeri, Régis Marcon and Anne-Sophie Pic were the first to carry out this mission as French gastronomy ambassadors aboard Air France flights, by including one of their creations among the different hot meals on the menu. As from October 2015, François Adamski will be the new guest to work with the Servair culinary studio. Increasingly applying its expertise and know-how to satisfy the Company’s customers, every day, Servair’s chefs adapt recipes to the constraints of airline catering, while maintaining the full spirit of the original recipes. Servair chefs also provide cabin crews with their expertise and know-how in an aim to highlight the value of the dishes on offer.\nSource: Air France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:25:09.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
