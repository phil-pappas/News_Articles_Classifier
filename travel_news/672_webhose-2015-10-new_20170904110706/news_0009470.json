Landscapers will lay down granite and limestone rocks as well as Arctic plants to complete the tundra component of the gardens, which also include boreal forest and prairie grassland zones. \nLishman, whose work leading migratory birds with an aircraft was dramatized in the 1996 Oscar-nominated film “ Fly Away Home ,” lives in Blackstock, Ont., near Lake Scugog, and has travelled extensively in the Arctic and Antarctic. \n“I have every hope my work will bring a semblance of the awe felt by most who experience the vast reality of the Canadian Arctic,” he said in a statement.
