Algy Cluff, the head of Cluff Natural Resources, told the Telegraph the Scottish Government’s ban on unconventional gas extraction combined with the closure of the Longannet power station is creating a “huge energy problem” for Scotland. He refused to comment on claims that Fergus Ewing, the Energy Minster, imposed the moratorium on underground coal gasification (UCG) to paper over a split in the SNP over the procedure ahead of the Holyrood elections and a potentially divisive debate at next week’s party conference. But he said he will now invest in England and warned there was no guarantee that his shareholders would want to return to the company’s proposed scheme under the Firth of Forth at Kincardine if UCG is given the green light in future. Mr Cluff, was one of the first North Sea pioneers of the early 1970s had claimed the development of the technology could be the “North Sea mark two”. His company already has a licence to develop the UK’s first offshore UCG project at the site, a scheme that economists claim would have generated £603 million for the economy and created up to 830 jobs. Although Mr Ewing is thought to be sympathetic to the technology, he was facing a rebellion from the SNP’s rank-and-file members, including a faction called Smaug (SNP Members Against Unconventional Gas). The minster yesterday announced a ban until Prof Campbell Gemmell, the former chief executive of environmental agency Sepa, could complete an investigation into it. He also disclosed that an existing moratorium on onshore fracking would last until at least the Spring of 2017 while five separate reports are compiled, pushing a final decision on whether to allow that procedure well beyond May’s Holyrood election. Longannet power station is due to close next year Photo: PA Mr Cluff warned the UCG moratorium combined with the expected closure of the Longannet coal-fired power station in Fife next year could create a “very dangerous situation in a few years” for Scotland’s energy supply. “One has to wonder, where is the urgency? They’ve got a huge energy problem coming up with the closure of the coal-fired power station,” he said. Questioning the need for Prof Gemmell’s inquiry, he said: “The UK Government spent 10 years concluding that this was appropriate. They’ve (the Scottish Government) have kicked it into the long grass. “ We will go to England and it’s ironic because we thought that the Scottish would embrace us because they’ve got the particular imminent problem with Longannet, so it’s surprising to say the least.” Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Tory energy spokesman, said: “This is another issue where SNP are going from populist position and ignoring scientific evidence. “It is disappointing that this opportunity is being put on the back-burner as a result of the SNP’s internal difficulties. The SNP need to start listening to the scientific evidence on this and on so many other issues.” Sarah Boyack, Labour’s environmental justice spokesman, said: “For months now the SNP has faced the accusation of being two faced on fracking and unconventional gas by campaigning in elections on anti-fracking platforms whilst reassuring big business behind the scenes that Scotland would be open for business. “They can’t have it both ways but it looks like they’re going to try to until at least the 2016 elections.” Mr Ewing yesterday said the UCG moratorium would “allow time for full and careful consideration of the potential impacts of this technology for Scotland.\" He insisted he had ordered the fracking studies as part of a “precautionary, robust and evidence-based approach to this technology in stark contrast to the gung-ho approach of the UK Government.” But an expert group commissioned by the Scottish Government reported in July last year that fracking could deliver major economic benefits and there were no significant technological barriers but warned the best shale gas reserves were in the most populated areas. After Mr Ewing announced the fracking ban earlier this year over health and environmental concerns, Professor Paul Younger, an expert who sat on the group, said his justifications for it were “all made up” and “completely feigned.” telepolitics Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:37:27.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
