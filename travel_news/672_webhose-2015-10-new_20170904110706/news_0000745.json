It is currently being rolled out across the Australian carrier’s network of 27 international routes. \nSo before we get down to the actual food, what has changed? Firstly, the meals themselves are 50 percent bigger than before. While CEO Alan Joyce is quoted as saying it has cost 40 percent more to produce the meals, the airline has ditched the tray concept and the meal comes served in a single plate. A Qantas staffer pointed out that 70 percent of the production time was gone into preparing the tray, so eliminating this helped save costs and time elsewhere in the process. \nWhile most airlines offer two or three meal options, Qantas offers four, three on the menu and a fourth as an option to pre-book through its online Q-Eat option when booking your ticket. One of the four options is also a meal chosen especially for the region. \nSome other additions include offering rolls infused with butter, doing away with the small butter portions, and a Bickford’s signature welcome drink after take-off (which is a popular brand in Australia we are told). \nScientists point out that at high altitudes passengers’ taste buds stop working properly. The low humidity dries out your nasal passages and the air pressure desensitises your taste buds, so airlines often aim for salty or spicy options. \nWhile this is something which can’t be controlled, Joey Russo, project at lead inflight service design international customer experience at Qantas, claimed that the testing of the new bigger meals had resulted in positive feedback during training. According to Russo, positive feedback on test routes using the new meals were as high as the 80s, when they previously averaged in the 20s or 30s. \nThe list of options available on the Dubai leg include the following: \n- Hara bhara chicken salad with barley and wild rice \n- Pan fried dory with Sichuan sauce and fried rice \n- Braised beef shank with mash potato and green beans \nSo how was the experience? I opted for the beef shank option. It didn’t look that much like the glossy marketing image on posters around the room, but then they never really do. The beef was a bit chewy and burnt in places, but the mash and sauce was very well made and tasty. I can’t say I was satisfied, as I think no one would ever really choose to eat economy plane food, it’s just an unavoidable necessity as part of the journey. With the kangaroo airline in the midst of a $2 billion restructuring and cost-cutting, has the move actually helped push people to book more flights with it? That’s the golden question and not one the executives are yet able to answer. Would it make me opt for Qantas over another airline? I doubt it, as, at the end of the day, economy class flying is all about the cost of the ticket and this is usually the main deciding factor. \nTo make up your mind if Qantas has succeeded in revolutionizing economy food here’s the shiny marketing image of the beef meal, while below is version which appeared on my table at the press conference (which I imagine is likely to be the best presented version of what you can expect as a passenger).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:29:52.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
