PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sat, Oct 24, 2015 SAT MAG Side waterfront \nWow,” declared my four-year-old son, open-mouthed, as our taxi emerged from thick pine forest to pass a colossal Roman amphitheatre. One glance at the marble relics of an ancient city centre, with towering temple columns strewn by the roadside, and we knew this was far from a typical trip to a local fishing village. \nStruck by the open access to such well-preserved ruins, we joined the tourists roaming across an ancient bazaar and headed to the amphitheatre that once seated 20,000 bloodthirsty spectators. \nEntrance to Side’s sleepy town through an arched fountain gate is restricted, however, to protect the fragile warren of alleyways that snake down to the waterfront. \nAfter explaining as best we could to our son about jousting gladiators and circus beasts, our 15-minute stroll to the majestic port temples of Apollo and Athena was accompanied by the calming echoes of the mosque’s call to prayer. SAT MAG The temple of Apollo \nSide, located in the popular province of Antalya and pronounced “see day,” means pomegranate in the area’s ancient dialect, and the fruit appeared on Roman coins to symbolise fertility in one of the empire’s key trading posts. \nWith Side’s year-round warm climate, larger hotels were built in the 1980s east of the harbour, but in recent years new properties have sprung up in the west, taking advantage of the lush forest backdrop. \nTwo years ago, the five-star Sensatori Turkey resort opened its doors and my family reaped the benefits staying at this beachfront base, just a five-minute bus ride from the harbour. \nWe soon settled into a daily routine – my four-year-old son plunging straight from our terrace into the long pool that ran directly along the ground-floor, sea-view rooms, and it was here he proudly removed his armbands for the first time and embraced doggy paddle. \nThere was also the bonus that our six-month-old baby was easy to settle for morning and afternoon naps in the comfort of his cot, while we enjoyed the pool. SAT MAG 'Ensconced in the beauty of Side, I’d defy anyone not to feel rejuvenated' \nEvery taste was catered for at the huge buffet, but for true Turkish fare our favourite was the small Safran restaurant, which served Side’s most famous fish dish, trout casserole. Here you can also savour an expertly prepared lamb kebab and large plates of meze. \nThere is even an authentic griddle station by the beach to enjoy hand-cooked Turkish flatbread (gozleme), delicious with a sucuk filling (traditional spicy sausage). \nParents in need of total relaxation can leave their little ones in the supervised playhouse and make their way to the hotel’s marble hammam, a glamorous steam room. Here, I indulged in a detoxifying bath ritual while our eldest child was having the time of his life at a seashell and sand art session. \nI wasn’t the only sleep-deprived mum who entered the spa on day two hoping for ancient healing miracles and it didn’t disappoint. But ensconced in the beauty of Side, I’d defy anyone not to feel rejuvenated. \nWay to go \nThomson offers seven-night holidays to Turkey staying at the Sensatori Resort Turkey in Side on an all-inclusive basis from £576 per person.
