In Managing and marketing to the future of generation Y, Josh discussed the ‘dynamic social shift’ that will see millennials soon take center stage in the world of work. “Today they seem young, tomorrow they will be in charge”, Josh explained. \nDigital connectivity, social reasonability and individuality all characterize the generation which currently numbers 2.3 billion worldwide. Josh compared the different generations, encouraging businesses to understand and cater for generation Y in order to remain relevant, warning that 40% of today’s Fortune 500 companies are currently predicted to disappear by 2050. An issue echoed by Karen deKanter from BCD Meetings & Events, who attended the session: “Josh made a great point about bridge building between generations, learning how to work together across the demographics. He delivered a really informative session, highlighting that there’s a tsunami-like change on the horizon and, in order to stay relevant, we need to grab a surfboard and ride that wave!” Daniele Arreola from Nizuc Resort & Spa added: “Josh really lifted the lid on the millennial generation. Our clients are beginning to be part of that market and very soon they’ll be our core target. He made some great points about understanding the generation’s expectations of the workplace – we need to be aware of their requirements if we want to train and retain them in our organizations.” The innovative daily MPI keynote speakers are rounded off tomorrow by former Nashville songwriter and performer Patrick Henry who is set to show attendees how to build an extraordinary customer experience in Becoming 'Remember-able'. Much of the powerful education at IMEX America also takes place on the show floor, both at the Inspiration Hub and across many exhibitor booths. At the International Association for Exhibitions and Events (IAEE) booth, Vice President of Learning Experiences Marsha Flanagan revealed the Exhibition and events education trends. With the amount of money spent per employee on education increasing (according to the Association for Talent & Development), Marsha shared her thoughts on how meeting planners can provide cutting edge education, beginning with researching the target market and ‘identifying the education gaps.’ She ran through the options for session formats for education both inside and outside the event, outlining how planners can move beyond the traditional classroom setting towards informal and interactive formats. Martha’s tips included the use of technology, games, exercise, outdoor locations and set design. Greg McCormack, director of national sales at T3 Expo, who attended the session comments: “Education is increasingly about sharing information rather than being talked at. People want to be part of a community and get together to network and learn”. Desbo Mohono from the department of tourism in South Africa, North West province adds: “In our sector, it’s no longer about the classroom setting. This session has shown me ways to creatively use different spaces, both inside and outside.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:32:03.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
