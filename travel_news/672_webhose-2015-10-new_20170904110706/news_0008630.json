The production opened at Beijing’s National Theatre in September after more than two years of adapting the script for Chinese audiences and searching for puppeteers with the right skills. “The Chinese version was a great challenge for both sides,” said Lisa Burger, executive director of the National Theatre in London. “Through more than two years of work, we learnt much from each other. The long collaboration helped us to understand each other.” Zhou Yuyuan, president of China’s National Theatre, added: “With War Horse we are not simply co-producing a play, we’re learning a great deal about staging techniques, theatre management and actor training.” Adapted from Michael Morpurgo’s novel, the play tells the story of Joey, a bay thoroughbred, and his adventures before and during the First World War. On stage, the horse is represented by an intricate life-sized puppet. The show was first staged in 2007 at the Olivier Theatre before moving to the West End in 2009 where it won a raft of awards. Li Dong, a producer with China’s National Theatre, watched the play in August 2011 and was so impressed he set out to bring it to China. Two years later, he returned to London to discuss a collaboration project between the two national theatres and firmed up a proposal to create a Mandarin version of War Horse . The first performance in Beijing was on September 4 and the show will run until Oct 31, after which it will move to Shanghai, from Nov 15 to Jan 17, and then to Guangzhou, from March 8 to May 3. The show has received positive reviews, including from George Osborne, who visited the Chinese capital in September as head of a delegation of 80 British business and cultural leaders. “I’m so impressed. It was incredible,” the Chancellor said while chatting with actors backstage after a performance in Beijing on Sept 20. “The horse Joey looks so vivid.” Jude Kelly, artistic director of the Southbank Centre, who has visited China eight times to watch Chinese traditional operas and contemporary plays, said: “The Chinese version of War Horse is such a powerful and touching play. Theatre is really flourishing in China.” Producers of the Beijing production said the biggest challenge was getting to grips with the life-sized Joey created by South Africa’s Handspring Puppet Co. At 7ft 8in tall and 185lb, it takes three puppeteers to operate. “The shape of the story is the same, but we had to work on the translation, the script and the songs to make the play resonate with Chinese audiences\" Alex Sims, director Co-directors Wang Tingting and Liu Dan, puppetry director Liu Xiaoyi and a team of technicians travelled to London in January last year for training on how to stage the play. A few months later, China’s National Theatre started its search for puppeteers. Producers auditioned 1,000 applicants for 19 places. Puppet master Tommy Luther, who helped with casting the horse operators, arrived in Beijing several months before opening night to prepare them. “They need to have the ability to work well as a team, have the sensibility to listen to one another, to be able to follow each other’s suggestions, signals, ideas as well as to offer their own ideas, to lead sometimes,” he said during a break in rehearsals. “It’s an extraordinary experience. I was born in Portugal and trained in London, so I have a European mentality. For me, it’s fresh and exciting to work with the Chinese actors, including dancers, acrobats, Peking Opera performers, and they’re all from different regions of China.” He said each puppeteer was given a handbook, How to Think Like a Horse , and was made to live on a farm for two weeks to observe how horses move and breathe. “We worked out the horses walk,” added Mr Liu, who operates Joey’s head when Mr Luther is not in China. “There’s a rhythm, a certain point where a part of the horse has to pick up a step otherwise it doesn’t look right. We slowly examined every tiny movement such as when a horse is frightened or worried.” The language barrier was another hurdle for the production, according to its director Alex Sims, who said the script presented several linguistic challenges. “The shape of the story is the same, but we had to work on the translation, the script and the songs to make the play resonate with Chinese audiences,” he said. “We’re lucky to have wonderful translators who have retained the show’s funny and touching points in a way that Chinese people can understand.” • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:43:59.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
