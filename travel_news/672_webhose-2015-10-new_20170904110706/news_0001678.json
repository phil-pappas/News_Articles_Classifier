Flight attendant bullies girl \nIn the video, the unidentified woman can be heard weeping in disbelief as a flight attendant named Tim points her out to one of his colleagues, who then orders her off the flight. \n“He was so mean to me!” the passenger says through tears, “I didn’t even do anything.” \nUnfortunately, the woman’s pleas fell on deaf ears, so she got out of her seat and made her way into the aisle. \nWhile the woman apologised to the flight attendants, her fellow passengers voiced their displeasure with what had just gone down. \n“This is the worst airline,” a woman can be heard saying, while another passenger chimed in with, “You just lost a lot of customers.” \nThen the assembled crowd booed the flight attendants as they escorted the woman off the plane. \n“It was nuts, and that poor woman was so upset. She handled it well, but you could tell it was super embarrassing for her,” Byrne said. \nHe added that he did not see why the flight attendant singled out the woman; however, other passengers reported that a miscommunication between flight attendant and passenger might have sparked the confrontation. \n“I’ve seen people who deserve that, but never actually seen somebody thrown off a plane,” Byrne said. \nA spokesperson for American Airlines told The New York Post , “We are looking into the incident to get a better understanding of what occurred. The passenger was recooked on the next flight to Portland.” \nIt seems spats between passengers and flight attendants are becoming more frequent, as airlines pack ever more seats into economy class to protect profit margins from falling ticket prices. \nEarlier this month, a drunk woman exposed her breasts during a fight with cabin crew on a flight to Hawaii. \nKristin Sharp, a 34-year-old real estate agent from Hawaii, was questioned by police after she clashed with a flight attendant during her flight from Las Vegas to Honolulu. \nThe trouble started brewing when a flight attendant asked Sharp to stop smoking an e-cigarette in a manner that she claims was rude and treated her with “a lack of manners”. \nOther passengers told police that Sharp was “drunk and belligerent”, swore, exposed her breasts to the cabin and threw a soda can at the employee. Sharp said she was trying to throw the can in rubbish bin. \nAmerican Airlines has been contacted by news.com.au for further comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:44:35.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
