For the past five years we have made investments and topped up our pension fund, paid into Isas, and even put a large sum into Premium Bonds. We have invested in three buy-to-let properties and still own our former business premises, the rent for which is paid into our pension. We are debt-free and have taken advice about inheritance tax mitigation. In short we have done everything we can to invest the money wisely. But even after all this we have £1m in high-street cash accounts that pay dismal rates of interest despite my vigilance and regular switching. I don’t want to tie up every penny in shares or even more property. Can you suggest where to put this large sum of cash? I would like to know what very rich people do with their money. AC, via email You appear satisfied that you have built up a balanced portfolio of investments, have maximised your pension and Isa contributions and taken steps to minimise your tax liabilities. But you still have £1m in cash languishing in bank accounts and wonder what the very rich do to grow their wealth. If you were feeling particularly speculative, one option that you could consider would be to follow your passions and invest in collectibles, for example. Some wealthy investors use surplus cash to buy classic cars that have given them enjoyment, as well as long-term capital appreciation. This year a treasure trove of 59 classic cars found languishing in a French barn sold at auction for £20m. Its star attraction was a 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spyder with covered headlights, one of only 37 ever made, that fetched almost £12m on its own. Classic cars and wine that has a lifespan of less than 50 years are not liable for capital gains tax (CGT) if the value increases and you sell, hence the added appeal for the “very rich” who have pulled every other tax-efficient lever in their financial affairs. Jewellery, paintings, antiques, stamps and some coins, it should be noted, are liable if sold for more than £6,000. • Lego a 'better investment than shares and gold' • The war medals that have soared in value However, such items are difficult to value because they don’t normally produce an income in the same way as cash, bonds, property and shares. Dennis Hall, of Yellowtail Financial Planning, underlined that without a measurable income stream, the value is pure speculation. “You buy the asset in the hope that someone will pay you more than you paid for it,” he said. “If sentiment suddenly goes against you, then you end up sitting with an expensive white elephant. “Collectors with an eye on the future value collect only what they know and enjoy – and the same applies to art, which is a very fickle business.” Mr Hall said many of his wealthy investors want to use their money to invest in the next generation of entrepreneurs. Becoming a “business angel” can be financially rewarding and helps young people grow their businesses. Similarly, there are many small businesses looking to borrow money for expansion or specific projects. “The returns on relatively short-term business lending is often close to double digit interest rates,” Mr Hall said. “It’s not without risk, but you wouldn’t put all your eggs in the same basket.” Specialist lending platforms such as ThinCats and Relendex are good places to start looking. Often the lending is secured against assets. Have a question for our experts?
