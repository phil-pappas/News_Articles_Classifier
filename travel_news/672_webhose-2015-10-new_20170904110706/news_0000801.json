(AP) â€” The shuttered Fredericksburg Area Museum and Cultural Center hopes to have a restructuring plan by the end of the year.\nUntil then, the nonprofit is keeping mum on what it is considering, said Susan Glasser , the museum's former president and chief executive officer.\nGlasser, who was hired last year, resigned on Oct. 9, but said she is helping out on a consulting basis as the foundation figures out a solution to its financial difficulties.\nThe museum has been struggling to pay off debt it incurred after purchasing and expanding into the Georgian-style bank building at the corner of Princess Anne and William streets and the retail shop next door on William Street.\nRenovating both cost more than expected, with the tab climbing to $12 million_not including an additional $1.5 million for exhibits. Several donors kicked in about $1 million each, but the museum ceased operations April 10 because it was unable to pay what was then $3.4 million of a $5 million construction loan.\nMuseum officials had planned to abandon those buildings and consolidate in the old Town Hall building at 907 Princess Anne St. if the museum's creditors were willing to accept the deed instead of pursuing foreclosure, according to a memo from Glasser.\n\"The bank, as I understand it, has declined to accept those terms,\" said City Manager Bev Cameron .\nThe plan also hinged on City Council and other prospective donors responding favorably to Glasser's request to provide half of the $1.5 million they say is needed to resume operations in old Town Hall in January. The rest would come from private donations and grants.\nCity Council proposed lending a hand_but only if the bank would accept the deed for the buildings in lieu of foreclosure.\n\"That's not going to happen,\" Cameron said. \"The situation is back before the museum board as to how they want to proceed.\"\nHe said that one idea that had been discussed was to relocate the Fredericksburg Visitor Center to the museum, but didn't think that was a viable concept.\n\"One of the main reasons is the city is not in a position to buy a building, which would certainly be required before we put anybody in there.\"\nCameron said that it's possible that the museum could do another fundraising push to raise enough money to pay off its debt.\nIn the meantime, Glasser said that the museum is continuing to pay its insurance and maintain environmental controls in the building to protect its collection of more than 7,000 objects, some of which are on loan from the city and private individuals.\n___\nInformation from: The Free Lance -Star, http://www.fredericksburg.com/", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://www.fredericksburg.com/", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:45:12.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
