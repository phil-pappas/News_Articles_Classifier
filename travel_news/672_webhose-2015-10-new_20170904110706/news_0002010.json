Waking up to another email from a potential client asking you to write for them. Controlling where and when you work, and the words that you produce. \nYou want to be a freelance writer. \nYou've been trying to figure out how to find freelance writing gigs, but so far all you hear is crickets and you're wondering what you're doing wrong. \nMaybe you've scoured sites like Fiverr, oDesk, and Elance for clients who will pay more than $20 for a 1,000-word article but came up short. \nYou've started a blog hoping that clients will take notice and offer up writing jobs like banks offer credit cards on college campuses. \nBut it seems as if the only jobs out there are meant for people who are willing to work for $2.50 an hour and sacrifice on quality to get the job done. \nDo those successful freelancers have some sort of special tool they use? You begin to wonder if they're just lucky. Maybe there's some merit behind this whole \"starving artist\" thing. \nI have good news for you: there's a way to start booking high-paying clients so you can write on topics that you love. \nHere are six steps you can take to land your first freelance writing client, charge a premium for your work and never have to pitch again. I used this method to start my freelancing career, and just to make sure, I replicated it again and booked three clients with the framework again. It works for people other than me, too. \nIt's not rocket science. It's not luck or special tools and it has nothing to do with glittery unicorns. And the truth is, with a bit of hard work and strategic \"marketing\", chances are this will work for you as well. And at the very least, you'll have built up a great writing portfolio which is necessary to land clients. \nSo try it out. \n6 Steps to Landing More Freelance Writing Gigs Than You'll Know What to Do With \n1. Create a Writer Website \nIn the rest of this post, I'll be teaching you how to find freelance clients in a series of steps. \nBut to effectively land your first freelance client (and all subsequent clients), you need a website. Trying to find clients without a website is like applying for photography jobs without a portfolio. You can do it, but it won't be very effective. \nHaving a writer website not only gives your potential client all the information they need in one spot, but it also communicates that you are professional. Potential clients need that reassurance. After all, they never know if you're going to plagiarize their article instead of write an original and with a website, they know where to find you if anything goes wrong. \nAnd this isn't even mentioning competition. You're not alone in the fight for freelancing jobs, and you don't want to lose them to writers who seem more legitimate because they have websites. \nI created a writer's website for the sake of testing the methods in this article again (they worked for me once, so I started from scratch and replicated the process to make sure they would work for me again. Good news: they did!) and my website sealed the deal on 4 of the 5 freelance jobs that I took to test this article. \nI even had a client tell me they were relieved I had a website to showcase my work. So.. \nIf You Already Have a Blog or Website You can (generally) use your hosting that you already have to register an \"addon\" domain to your account to host another website. If you use Bluehost, go to your dashboard in Bluehost and press \"addon domains\". Then, type in the domain for your writer's site (usually your name - here's how to choose a domain) and choose \"use an existing directory\". \nIf You Don't Have a Website You need to choose your domain name . This is the fun part! For writer's websites, usually people will register their first and last name, or use something like writingbysarah.com or sarahwrites.com. \nSecond, you need a simple, self-hosted WordPress website. You can set these up inexpensively. \nI've also created a step-by-step tutorial to walk you through how to set your website up in 5 minutes. \nThird, you need a simple, clean WordPress theme. You can find these for free through your WordPress dashboard under Appearance>Themes, or you can buy a cheap 1-3 page theme on a site like Themeforest. CreativeMarket releases free goods every week and they also have some great simple themes in their freebies every once in awhile. \nMy writer website uses TA Portfolio, which is a free theme and is super simple and easy to use. \nFourth, you need to populate your website. Here's what you need to include: A \"Hire Me\" page: A page with your contact information. Include your email address, Skype username, and any social media profiles that make sense (ie LinkedIn). A Portfolio page: My website above includes a \"writing\" tab, with links to the articles I've written so far and RESULTS. That's in caps for a reason. You'll find out why below. You likely don't have much of a portfolio right now, but we'll fix that as you continue down the article. An About page: For potential clients that want to know a bit more about you - and especially your story about how you came to want to write about the topic. \nThis is pretty simple, and it should only take an hour or two to complete. After you do that... \n2. Start Building Your Portfolio \nNow that you have a website, you might be wondering what you're supposed to put in the portfolio section. After all, you're new to this. You don't have any work to show off yet. \nThat's where guest posting comes in. One of the best ways to boost your profile, get exposure, and put your writing in front of thousands of eyes is to write a guest article for a popular publication. \n3. Promote Your Article Like It's Your Job \nWhen your guest post goes live, it's important that you promote the post like it went live on your own website. Here's what I do for every guest post: Schedule a few Tweets using Buffer on Twitter Post it to Facebook (your personal page and, if you have a website, your website's page too) Pin it to Pinterest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:52:14.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
