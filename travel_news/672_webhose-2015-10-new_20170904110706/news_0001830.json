The deal allowed passengers of both airlines to earn and redeem frequent flyer points or miles.\nToday, Qatar Airways announced it will resume the operation of both daily services between Hong Kong and Doha from February 16, meaning the Gulf carrier will effectively monopolise the route.\nQR said in a statement: \"The operating carrier change will have minimum impact on passengers who are booked on Cathay Pacific-operated flights from Hong Kong to Doha after February 15. Affected passengers will be re-accommodated on the Qatar Airways-operated flight due to operate on the same schedule.\"\nWhile Cathay's CX code will remain on Qatar Airways flights between Doha and Hong Kong, it will be removed from QR services from Doha to other destinations from Feburary 15.\nQatar Airways will keep its QR code on \"selected Cathay Pacific flights from Hong Kong to Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Japan\".\nCathay said it \"remains committed to serving the Middle East market and we will continue to identify opportunities to strengthen its services to and from the region\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:36:33.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
