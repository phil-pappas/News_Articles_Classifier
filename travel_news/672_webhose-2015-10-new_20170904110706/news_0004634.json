Hotels may also be weak in training and general safety awareness among staff. Hardware maintenance may also be lacking.” \n\nThe Global Hotel Security Standard is recognised by ICCA and Kanold is working on getting it recognised on the buyer side, such as travel managers, tour operators and travel agents. \n\nGeoffrey Fordham, senior vice president, engineering, Safety & Security, Onyx Hospitality Group, believed that a global certification can “give confidence in our own internal systems”. \n\nFordham added: “We also get very detailed requests for proposals on safety and security to the extent that we have to name the person responsible for (those aspects).” \n\nUnderscoring the importance of safety, Geetha Arekal, Asia Pacific travel lead at Unilever Industries, said: “In our RFP we want to know how a hotel measures safety and does it match with our requirements. One bad feedback will wipe a hotel from our RFP.\" \n\nRead more reports from the ground in our IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific 2015 Show Dailies .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:45:29.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
