Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul, Minister of Tourism and Sports said, “The Ride to Khong’s Legendary biking competition will mark a new era of tourism for Thailand’s Northeastern region, which is poised to become an important hub for sports tourism in the Mekong area. This region is complete with picturesque natural landscapes, rich historical and cultural legacies, international standard sporting facilities, and convenient transportation access to the neighbouring Mekong countries; hence, it is the ideal destination for those who seek to enjoy sports challenges and cultural tourism at the same time.” \nThe ‘Ride to Khong’s Legendary’ biking competition is a long bike ride, covering a 248-kilometre route in four provinces – Nong Khai, Bueng Kan, Nakhon Phanom and Mukdahan. The route features beautiful natural scenery, including the scenic routes along the Mekong River, allowing bikers to experience the charming Thai way of life along the ride. \nThe three-day competition will be divided into three different stages, smooth, steep and challenging rides. Each day will feature different stages of difficulty. The winners of the event will be awarded with the Royal Trophy of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn. \nThe event is set to attract biking enthusiasts from Australia, Korea, Malaysia, the UK and other European countries as well as from ASEAN countries. \nH.E. Kobkarn added, “Following the recent tremendous success of the Bike for Mom activity presided over by His Royal Highness Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, we have seen a growing demand and increasing trend for such biking activity. We anticipate this Ride to the Khong’s Legendary will be another successful biking event that draws both local and international enthusiasts to enjoy the challenge and the scenic and culturally-rich region of Thailand.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:39:45.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
