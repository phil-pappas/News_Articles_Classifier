VOK DAMS recruited a total of 10 designers from various design disciplines ranging from graphic design, architecture, motion design, interactive design, sculptures, furniture design, photography and fashion. Furthermore, a series of workshops with a strong focus on exchange and mutual inspiration between the Audi Industrial Designers from the Conceptual Design Studio Munich and local designers from Beijing was organised.
