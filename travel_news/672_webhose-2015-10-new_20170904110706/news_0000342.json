Following a record year in 2015, the California -based manufacturer promises to inspire an even broader range of riders with two new models, an innovative new motor design, faster charging and advanced lithium-ion cell chemistry powering the highest battery capacity and efficiency to date. Zero delivers even greater value by lowering the price on two base models while adding more features and performance throughout.\n\" 2016 marks our tenth year of pioneering electric motorcycles,\" said Zero Motorcycles CEO Richard Walker . \"In an industry where sales are pretty flat and breakthrough innovations hard to find, we continue to experience rapid growth by investing in technology that delivers excitement and a ride experience unmatched by anything.\"\nThe 2016 announcement began with the introduction of two new motorcycles, bringing Zero's offering to six distinct models. The supermoto-inspired Zero FXS promises to turn mundane city streets into an urban playground. It features 70 ft-lb of torque, weighs less than 300 pounds and boasts components specifically tailored to provide exceptional control and responsiveness on the street. Adventure riders demanding maximum performance will enjoy the new Zero DSR. With 106 ft-lb of torque, the versatile dual sport is quick on the pavement and demonstrates greater prowess on dirt roads and trails.\n\"The 2016 line is the culmination of a decade of experience and leverages what we do best: create electric powertrains that deliver a thrilling ride,\" said Abe Askenazi , Zero Motorcycles Chief Technology Officer. \"The technology is sophisticated, but the way the power is delivered is simple and pure. Ride one, and you'll understand why we are focused exclusively on electric motorcycles.\"\nZero continues to advance state-of-the-art electric motorcycle technology with their signature Z-Force® powertrain. The new Z-Force® IPM (interior permanent magnet) motor produces power more efficiently, cools more rapidly and has higher thermal capability, which translates into significantly improved performance during hard riding and allows higher sustained top speeds. Power is delivered by Z-Force® power packs with optimized lithium-ion cell technology. The system boasts the highest energy density in the electric vehicle industry. Gains in capacity and efficiency have pushed the range up to 197 miles in the city and 98 miles on the highway (at 70 mph) with the optional Power Tank accessory.\nZero Motorcycles delivers the speed and convenience of Level 2 charging. With the new Charge Tank accessory, riders will be able to take advantage of the rapidly expanding network of public charging stations and charge three times faster. The Charge Tank works on the popular J1772 standard and effectively recharges a Zero in two to three hours.\nZero continues to set the benchmarks in performance, selection and range. As innovation enables the motorcycles to go farther and faster, they are also becoming easier to own.\n\"We set out to transform the two-wheeled experience for transportation and recreation, and a key part of that strategy is to make our motorcycles available to more people,\" said Scot Harden , Zero Motorcycles VP of Global Marketing. \"Investments in technology, our experience and continued growth allow us to lower the price of two of popular models, the Zero S ZF9.8 streetfighter and Zero DS ZF9.8 dual sport. The thrill of electric is more accessible than ever.\"\nDetailed specifications and prices are available at www.zeromotorcycles.com . New models arrive at authorized Zero Motorcycles dealers in November 2015 . Motorcycle prices range from $8,495 to $15,995 , depending upon model. The Charge Tank accessory is scheduled for delivery in February 2016 and will have a suggested retail price of $1,988 .
