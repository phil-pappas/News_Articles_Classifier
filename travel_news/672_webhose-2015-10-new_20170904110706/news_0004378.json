Eventual returns from putting money aside in tax-free, Junior Isas are likely to disappoint because too much of the money remains in cash deposits, despite overwhelming evidence that investing in stock and shares over long periods brings far greater rewards. Research indicates that parents’ own caution about investing in the stock market should not extend to investments made in the name of their children. That’s because a child will typically have far longer to remain invested, leaving time for short-term falls in share prices to even out. Despite that, 70pc of money flowing into Junior Isas went into cash, and not shares, last year, according to HM Revenue & Customs figures. • Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas “For the majority of Junior ISA investors, cash is simply the wrong choice and parents and grandparents should be looking to a stocks and shares Junior ISA to improve the potential returns,” said Danny Cox, a chartered financial planner for Hargreaves Lansdown, the broker. “Investing for new born children or grandchildren is the most popular time with nearly 30pc of our Junior ISAs being set up before the child reaches their first birthday. “Sensibly these parents and grandparents are recognising that over the longer term a stocks and shares Junior ISA is likely to provide a much better return than a cash Junior ISA.” A wealth of data has shown over generations that shares outperform other asset classes. One of the most authoritative studies is the Barclays Equity Gilt Study which tracks asset returns for more than a century. The table belows shows annualised returns, after inflation, for different asset classes if they are held for different time periods. Last year (2014) 10 years 20 years 50 years 115 years Equities -0.4% 4.1% 4.6% 5.7% 5% Corporate bonds 10.7% 2.5% n/a n/a n/a Cash -0.2% -0.7% 1.1% 1.5% 0.8% Gilts 16.4% 3.7% 5.1% 2.9% 1.3% Source: Barclays Equity Gilt Study For the current tax year, £4,080 can be set aside inside a Junior Isa and no tax will be due on any returns that are made. It is now six months since the government handed the parents of children with Child Trust Funds (CTFs), the forerunner to Junior Isas, an escape from the older products. CTFs offered only restricted investment choices, typically simplified “stakeholder” products, while Junior Isas allow the same fund choices as adult investors enjoy. Hargreaves said that the best-selling Junior Isa funds among parents transferring CTFs since the rules changed mirrored closely the most popular funds in general.(See list) Equity income funds were popular, including Woodford Equity Income, managed by Neil Woodford.

He said that a “dual approach”, with a core, safer holding plus something more volatile, but potentially higher growth, would suit many parents. He said that a low-cost tracker fund or equity income fund could do the job as a core holding. UK trackers from Fidelity and L&G charge 0.06pc when purchased through, respectively, the Fidelity and Hargreaves Lansdown fund platforms. Vanguard's UK FTSE All-Share charges just 0.07pc if you do not invest through those platforms. • The cheapest index tracker funds An emerging markets fund would suit those looking for a high-growth option.
