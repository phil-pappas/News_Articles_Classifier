The French were abject but the manner in which they were dispatched was of the highest order. Ma’a Nonu, Julian Savea and Dan Carter were all outstanding, with the No10 playing probably his finest game for a couple of years. In the pack Brodie Retallick and Kieran Read were not only ball players, they made the hard yards when needed and pulled their weight in the tight. Duane Vermeulen and Fourie du Preez combined to manufacture the decisive South Africa try that beat Wales and both will contend for the best player in their respective positions at this World Cup. Vermeulen was a titanic figure at No8 and, though not named man of the match against Wales, he made the key contribution. Heroic in defeat is not a refrain any Scottish supporter wants to hear because it has been the case too many times in recent years for their team. Sheer determination: Duane Vermeulen has been a star performer at the World Cup Nonetheless there were truly heroic performances from No8 Dave Denton and Greig Laidlaw, with the rest of the team not far behind. Denton was magnificent in his tireless efforts about the field, while Laidlaw did as much as any scrum-half and captain could do get his side over the line. However, in the end it was Argentina’s win over Ireland that was the most impressive achievement of the round. They not only beat arguably the best northern hemisphere side in the tournament, but they did so by playing with ball in hand and with width. Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe was an inspirational leader and full-back Joaquín Tuculet showed great class. However, the stand-out was Juan Imhoff. The winger’s two tries stunned Ireland and the second was something to behold. For that brilliant solo effort and more he is my Liontrust hero of the week.
