Since efforts to push RMB offshore activities began in 2011, London has become one of Europe’s leading players thanks to government support and interest from the private sector. “Renminbi businesses are very important to London,” said Mark Boleat, policy chairman of the City of London Corp. The total trade finance in RMB through London more than doubled last year “In volume terms they are still small in relation to overall financial activities but it helps to keep London as a leading financial centre so that businesses know they have the choice to raise money in RMB in London.” The total trade finance in RMB through London more than doubled last year, with the daily trading worth $61.5 billion (£6.3 billion), statistics from the City showed. The daily spot transaction of renminbi hit 18.4 billion yuan, more than three times the amount recorded over the same period in 2013. Milestone developments such as the establishment of a yuan-sterling swap agreement in 2013 and the appointment of a yuan-clearing bank in London last year received the lion’s share of attention. China started to drive its currency internationalisation policy after the financial crisis with a view to helping the RMB become an alternative global reserve currency to the United States dollar. Evan Goldstein, Deutsche Bank’s head of global RMB solutions, said the progress in recent years was characterised by both the increasing use of the RMB in cross-border trade and the various efforts to liberalise capital accounts. Renminbi internationalisation is also strongly linked to China’s national strategy These efforts are accompanied by the building of infrastructure necessary to facilitate cross-border trade and investment such as the creation of RMB swap arrangements with other central banks and the approval of yuan-clearing banks in international jurisdictions by the People’s Bank of China, Mr Goldstein said. Renminbi internationalisation is also strongly linked to China’s national strategy and increasing integration with the global economy as well as key issues such as climate change mitigation and infrastructure investment. Some of London’s financial institutions are playing a big role in helping the Chinese government achieve these goals. For example, HSBC has been working closely with Chinese policymakers to grow the RMB green finance market by sharing its understanding of international practices. Green finance, which includes asset classes such as green bonds and green initial public offerings, uses financial mechanisms to channel funds into socially responsible activities. Spencer Lake, global head of capital financing for HSBC, previously said in a keynote speech that the growth of an onshore capital market for green bonds in China and its interaction with the international capital market is one effective solution to some of China’s ongoing funding needs and in particular infrastructure requirements. “Developing an efficient green bond market could help to provide a much-needed source to finance the country’s sustainable economic growth... as well as having overall positive effects. This development could also address other needs around innovative energy, business efficiency, water, land and waste management,” he said. China has played a key role in the formation of new multinational institutions Closely linked to China’s sustainable financing agenda is China’s leadership in the financing of infrastructure projects in Asia and among other countries it closely trades with and again RMB financing can greatly help to achieve these goals, said Huo Rongrong, global head of China and RMB business for capital financing at HSBC, responsible for all primary market RMB products globally. China has played a key role in the formation of new multinational institutions such as the Silk Road Fund, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the BRICS Development Bank, so new opportunities abound for China to provide foreign currency and yuan-denominated funding for infrastructure projects of other emerging economies. Just as cross-border trade activities between China and its partner countries are increasingly denominated in the RMB to reduce the costs of financing this could be true for infrastructure financing too. “For example, the Silk Road Infrastructure Fund is likely to co-invest in projects alongside Chinese corporations and some of these projects could connect with Chinese technology and services, so there is lots of value around the whole project cycle that could be created,” Ms Huo said. Commentators are optimistic about the inclusion of the yuan in the IMF's reserve currency basket Meanwhile, the progress of RMB internationalisation is so fast that commentators are speaking optimistically about the inclusion of the yuan in the International Monetary Fund’s basket of reserve currencies in its review in November, a process that happens once every five years. Known as the Special Drawing Rights, this basket of reserve currencies is held by many IMF member countries’ central banks as a part of their national reserves. Currently it is comprised of the US dollar, euro, sterling and yen. Andrew Carmichael, a partner at the law firm Linklaters, said that the potential inclusion of the RMB in the basket will mean central banks will need to take RMB into account for reserves purposes and will need access to it for purchases and sales of and hedging of transactions in SDRs, leading to an increased and institutionalised demand for the RMB. “For China it’s much more convenient if its own currency can be tendered as a component of SDR transactions with IMF and other central banks,” Mr Carmichael said. It it is easy to finance deficits by printing more money once it becomes a reserve currency... Jinny Yan, a senior economist at Standard Chartered, said China also needed to understand and fulfil the responsibilities associated with being a reserve currency. One is to keep a good domestic economy growth rate, because the RMB is likely to attract many international investors after it becomes more widely used, she said. The other important responsibility is to keep the deficit low because it is easy to finance deficits by printing more money once a country’s currency becomes a reserve currency but doing so will depreciate the currency and hurt the country’s citizens. Another important hint of the yuan’s likely inclusion is the criteria that IMF has set out for China’s capital market reform alongside its announcement, which means the IMF is seriously considering the RMB inclusion and has set out methods for it to fulfil the guidelines, Ms Yan said. “This shows that the RMB is not yet satisfying IMF criteria but it can continue with capital account liberalisation and quite easily satisfy the criteria,” she added. “Even if this may not be achieved for this year when the IMF review is done, it could be possible that the IMF decides to include the RMB subject to certain criteria being met before a deadline.” • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:32:41.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
