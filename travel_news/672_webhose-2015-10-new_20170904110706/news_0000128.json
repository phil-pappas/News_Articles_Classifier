Many of the company’s clients have been successful in business and have cash available to invest. However, they want to pick the businesses to back for themselves rather than handing control of their money to a fund and losing sight of where it is ultimately going. Instead, Rockpool offers them the chance to become part of a community of like-minded investors that meet regularly at investor events and have access to a range of carefully selected private company investment opportunities which qualify for the Enterprise Investment Scheme. What Network members say “I like the fact that Rockpool is so open. I can meet the management and I know where my money is going. Other companies I have invested through the Enterprise Investment Scheme hide the costs and give me no information” “The presentations were very impressive” “The quality of people and questions are exceptionally high” I can meet the management and I know where my money is going. Other companies I have invested through the Enterprise Investment Scheme hide the costs and give me no information “It's great to listen to what other people are asking as you may not have thought about that aspect of the business yourself” “An event like this is what the Network is all about. Meeting with other investors and sharing ideas and thoughts” How the Rockpool Network works Becoming part of the Rockpool Network gives members access to the range of investment opportunities that the company brings together. These can range from growing private businesses that require capital to expand to asset-rich companies that have lower potential returns. As Network members, Rockpool investors receive detailed information on each investment opportunity and can then meet the management at one of Rockpool’s regular investor events. Here they can question the management teams directly as well as benefit from the knowledge and insight of others in the Rockpool Network. This process allows each member to decide for themselves which opportunities match their risk appetite and return expectations, and invest accordingly. And even if none of the opportunities on the day are right for them, their membership of the Network means they can meet their fellow members in a relaxed setting and benefit from the opportunity to network with others who have enjoyed successful careers in business and as entrepreneurs. • To find out more about private investment opportunities, visit Rockpool.uk.com Please note: your capital is at risk and there is no guarantee of return. Tax benefits depend on your personal circumstances and compliance with relevant rules. You may not be able to sell your investment when you want .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:27:11.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
