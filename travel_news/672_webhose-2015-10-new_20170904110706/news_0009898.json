Coombe Abbey hotel, near Coventry, invested in a permanent marquee in 2012 to boost its ability to host a range of events and the move has proved successful as the venue has just hosted it 350th event which has helped propel the hotel to its best ever month. The marquee has hosted events ranging from Asian and Greek weddings, wedding anniversaries to car launches and corporate conferences. \nIt has also helped charities including Zoe’s Place, Mollie Olly’s Wishes, Acorns, Circles Network and The Lions raise money at celebration events. The success of the marquee will make September the most successful month – outside Decembers – in the hotel’s 21-year-old history. Coombe Abbey General Manager Ron Terry said: “The marquee has given us a very flexible space and has allowed us to bring events and trade to Coombe which may well have gone out of the area. “Being a Cistercian Abbey dating back to the 12th century is a very big draw for many of our guests and gives us a unique identity. But the layout of the property does not always lend itself to large gatherings, so the marquee has opened up new markets for us. “Many of the charities and good causes have an existing relationship with us but have not been able to host major gala dinners here before and, as they are regionally based, they may well have gone out of the Coventry and Warwickshire area. “The same is true of some corporate clients, but the marquee has allowed us to accommodate their needs and to attract new custom. “That, combined with a very healthy occupancy rate, means that this is set to be the most successful month outside December, in our history.” Warwick based Vicky Jackson, an internationally renowned P!nk and Lady Gaga tribute act, was the 350th event, playing for a crowd of 225. Ron added: “It was fitting that the 350th event was a perfect case in point – we simply could not have hosted that without the marquee.” Related articles Hilton London Bankside - now open Hilton London Bankside has announced that it is now officially open.
