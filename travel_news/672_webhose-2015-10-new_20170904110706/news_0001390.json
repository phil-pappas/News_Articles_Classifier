Decreasing revenue from movie rentals in hotels has driven the trend, with movie rental revenue per available hotel room dropping from $339 a year to $107 a year between 2000 and 2014, according to a report from PKF Hospitality Research. Hotel guests are renting fewer in-room movies because they can watch them on smartphones or laptops instead.\nMarriott hotels ended the practice of offering adult video on demand several years ago. The company’s chairman, Bill Marriott, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told The Associated Press in 2012 that not only was the church “very, very opposed to pornography,” but that demand for the movies had “gone way down” because “if they want that stuff, they can get on the computer.”\nMost Read Stories Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman arrested for investigation of hit-and-run Mayor wants developer off project, cites violation of city values Police: Woman linked to 1973 disappearance is actually alive Outraged Seattle Public Schools parents, pace yourselves Seattle Seahawks release WR B.J.
