Cindi and Bill Ekberg of Pacifica in Santorini, Greece. Photo: Courtesy Cindi Ekberg Small cruise ship great for Greek islands 1  /  1 Back to Gallery Where I went: Several places in Greece: Mykonos, Santorini, Crete, Kythira, Hydra and Athens.\nWhy I went: We wanted to cruise the islands in a much smaller ship than those of the bigger cruise lines.\nDon’t miss: Don’t miss the climb to the Acropolis and the Parthenon. Also the tomb of Agamemnon, and the gondola ride up to Santorini — beautiful view.\nDon’t bother: September has beautiful weather, but the occasional rain shower. Never wore a jacket, but wished I had packed a rain poncho.\nCoolest souvenir: Meeting people from all over the United States and taking memorable photos was our souvenir. Eating and drinking at the local cafes was wonderful.\nWorth a splurge: Staying at the five-star Royal Olympic Hotel for three nights after the cruise was fabulous. The panoramic view from our balcony included the Acropolis and Parthenon.\nWish I’d packed: Nothing else for myself, but a long pair of slacks for my husband for several dinners.\nOther comments: Greece has so many islands and so many archaeological ruins to explore. An absolutely wonderful vacation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:23:11.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
