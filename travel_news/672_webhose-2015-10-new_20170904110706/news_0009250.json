It is targeting 6.7 million visits in its first year of operation, in line with the Dubai government’s target of attracting 20 million visitors by 2020. \nThe project comprises three theme parks with branded rides and attractions — the Hollywood-themed motiongate Dubai, Bollywood Parks Dubai, and Legoland Dubai, as well as Riverpark — a grand entrance plaza with cafes, restaurants and shops — and Lapita, a Polynesian-themed family hotel operated by Marriott International. \nThe bridges will give access to the various resorts at a number of points along Sheikh Zayed Road, according to Mattar Al Al Tayer, Director-General of the RTA. \n“The bridges project, in which construction works have recently started, aims primarily at constructing entry and exit points linking the Dubai Parks project with the Sheikh Zayed Road,” Al Tayer said. \n“It comprises the construction of a 3-lane bridge stretching 1,500 metres as a main entry on the Sheikh Zayed Road for vehicles coming from Dubai and heading to Dubai Parks, and the construction of a 2-lane bridge stretching 1,000 metres as a main exit on the Sheikh Zayed Road from Dubai Parks in the direction of Abu Dhabi.” \nThe project will also provide roads within Dubai Parks to link with the Sheikh Zayed Road and Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Road, he said. \n“Works also cover roads extending 16 km comprising a dual carriageway of 2 lanes in each direction in addition to other works within the project zone extending 9km. The project works also include lighting, traffic signs, rainwater drainage, utility lines, besides shifting and protecting utility lines intercepting the project works such as electricity, water, communication and others,” Al Tayer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:15:35.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
