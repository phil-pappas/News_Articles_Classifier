Randt, Jr. and Patricia Mulroy to Board of Directors\nWynn Resorts, Limited (“Wynn Resorts,” “Wynn” or “the Company”) today announced the appointment of Clark T. “Sandy” Randt, Jr. and Patricia Mulroy to its Board of Directors, effectiveOctober 15, 2015. Ambassador Randt and Ms. Mulroy have been appointed as Class III (with a term expiring at the 2017 Annual Meeting) and Class I (with a term expiring at the 2018 Annual Meeting) Directors, respectively. Ms. Mulroy will also serve on the Board’s Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. With the appointment of Ambassador Randt and Ms. Mulroy, the Wynn Board of Directors now consists of nine Directors, seven of whom are independent.\nPatricia Mulroy brings more than 30 years of regional government experience to the Board, performing in numerous leadership roles focusing on Nevada’s public infrastructure. Most recently, she served as a Commissioner of the Nevada Gaming Commission and a member of the Global Agenda Council on Water of the World Economic Forum. Prior to that, she served as General Manager of theSouthern Nevada Water Authority from 1993 to 2014 and was the General Manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District from 1989 to 2014.\n“In the 45 years that I have been in business in Las Vegas, Pat Mulroy has been one of the most impressive public servants, running a large organization and dealing with complex issues. Her career managing both the Las Vegas and Southern Nevada Water Authorities was marked by a singular professional sensitivity to the sometimes competing needs of the community and the environment. My opinion is obviously shared at all levels of this state and its government, as evidenced by her appointment to the Nevada Gaming Commission by Governor Sandoval in 2014. Pat Mulroy’s willingness to join our board and apply her independent judgment on all matters is a marvelous and positive development at Wynn Resorts,” commented Stephen A. Wynn, Chairman and CEO.\nClark T. Randt, Jr. is currently President of Randt & Co. LLC, which advises firms with interests in China. Additionally, he serves as a Director of Qualcomm Inc., UPS and Valmont. He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Ambassador Randt was the longest serving United States Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China, stationed in Beijing from 2001 to 2009. Prior to that, Ambassador Randt was a partner at the international law firm of Shearman & Sterling, heading the firm’s substantial China practice out of Hong Kong. Ambassador Randt’s extensive experience in Asian business operations and U.S. investment in China will be invaluable to Wynn’s Board of Directors.\nWith respect to Ambassador Randt’s appointment, Mr. Wynn noted, “Considering our overwhelming commitment to the People’sRepublic of China and the Special Administrative Region of Macau, we are very fortunate to have Ambassador Randt joining our board. Ambassador Randt’s relationship with the central government of Beijing gives him a unique perspective on that government’s most fundamental issues and concerns. His appointment to manage our embassy in Beijing capped a stunning career that began as one of the leading attorneys of an American law firm in Hong Kong. Ambassador Randt speaks the language and understands the people; this sensitivity will inure to the benefit of Wynn Resorts and all of its shareholders.”\nSource:- Wynn Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:26:22.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
