From mixology sessions, to the Single Malt Seduction seminar – Cornucopia is placing liquor in the lime-light, revealing the ever-evolving beast that is: the spirits industry.\nPoured: The Full Spectrum of Taste is Cornucopia’s most all-encompassing drink event. Experience the full spectrum of flavour as you sip a 50 year old whisky from Europe, an expertly crafted B.C. beer, a Canadian cider or a fine wine from the world’s topmost regions. Anchoring the second Saturday of Cornucopia, Poured is a spirited night of music and revelry, with accompanying delicious bites from a variety of vendors. Tickets include a souvenir glass and five tasting tokens, with additional tokens available.\nCornucopia pays tribute to gin, not only as an instrumental piece of the ever-evolving mixology puzzle, but as a quality, standalone spirit. Being such a versatile liquor, gin has found its place at the well of every bar. Be it Hendricks or Tanqueray, gin and juice or gin and tonic, the old-world spirit has established itself as a globally-recognized staple drink order. Join Shaun Layton and Chris Funnell at the Gin Unplugged seminar, where their pure and simple mission is to break the stigma around gin; leading a guided tasting and discussion on a wide-range of gins with various flavour profiles.\nPemberton – Whistler’s neighboring community to the north – is home to some of British Columbia’s most committed producers and growers, including the Pemberton Distillery. The Pemberton Distillery is a boutique family owned and operated craft distillery producing the only certified-organic spirits in British Columbia, as well as being one of very few throughout North America. Lorien Schramm, Director of Product Development at Pemberton Distillery proudly states, “we can drive about 15km down the road to pick up 95 per cent of our ingredients! We also love to be able to offer our customers a distinctive product with truly local terroir, one that is absolutely unique to our region”. Sip on the Pemberton Distillery’s organic spirits at House Party, With a Twist, Pembytopia and more.\nBourbon or whisky? At Cornucopia, we say BOTH! Chris Funnell, a familiar face on the whisky (or whiskey) circuit, leads the Bourbon Country and Whisky Evolution seminars.\nIn the battle to bourbon supremacy there are two majority contenders: Kentucky and New Orleans. Explore the controversial history of bourbon, and why so many are eager to lay claim to the spirit’s origins, while sampling six to eight exceptional bourbons.\nThe evolution of whisky is one dependent on its area of origin – differing from country to country. However, what remains consistent is the often sizzling mix of rebellion, taxes, perseverance, and entrepreneurial spirit. Explore the flavours and characters that define whisky in places such as Ireland, Scotland, the USA, Japan, India, and Canada, tasting six to eight high-quality, small-batch whiskies from around the globe.\nPrefer your drink neat, on the rocks or with a twist? Have a soft spot for gin, vodka or whisky? Cornucopia, November 5 – 15, pays homage to the liquor industry, and celebrates the immense talent and growth blossoming within British Columbia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:27:18.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
