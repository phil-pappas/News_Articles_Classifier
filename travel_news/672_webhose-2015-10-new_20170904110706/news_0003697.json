I thought it was a joke.” \nA handful of people waited at a bus station before service ended at midday, while others bought water and loaded vehicles with jerrycans of fuel. \nWhile Patricia lashed the southern coast of Jalisco, it had yet to cause mayhem in Puerto Vallarta, where some 20 people were seen drinking at a beach bar earlier in the afternoon. \nThe US Hurricane Center has warned that Patricia was a “potentially catastrophic” hurricane and President Barack Obama said US disaster aid experts were on the ground and primed to help. \nTens of thousands of US tourists are among those in the hurricane’s path, US officials said.

Hundreds of shelters were made available. \nFishing communities were evacuated along Jalisco’s coast. \nIn Colima state, villages around the Volcano of Fire were emptied over concerns that ash that accumulated during recent volcanic activity could combine with water to produce landslides. \nAuthorities deployed 400 federal police to assist populations in the area. Patricia is expected to dump up to 51cm of rain over five western Mexican states, which could produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides. \nThe National Water Commission said Patricia was “so big and intense” that it could cross the entire country, dip into the Gulf of Mexico, and make landfall in the United States. \nJalisco, Michoacan, Colima and Nayarit states are expected to get the equivalent of 40 per cent of their annual rainfall in the next 48 hours, the water commission said. \nPatricia compared to Haiyan \nWith maximum sustained winds near 325km/h Patricia is the strongest storm ever recorded in the eastern Pacific or in the Atlantic, said Dave Roberts, a hurricane specialist at the US National Hurricane Centre. \nPatricia’s power was comparable to that of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7300 dead or missing in the Philippines two years ago, according to the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation. \nMore than four million people were displaced and more than one million houses were destroyed or damaged in 44 provinces in the central Visayas region, a large cluster of islands that includes some of the country’s poorest provinces.

Exact numbers of those evacuated were not immediately available. \nRoberto Ramirez, the director of Mexico’s National Water Commission, which includes the nation’s meteorological service, said that Hurricane Patricia will be powerful enough to lift up cars, destroy homes that are not sturdily built with cement and steel and will be able to drag along people caught outside when the storm strikes.

More than 900 guests had rooms at the hotel the previous evening, but many wanted to get out of town before the storm arrived. \nSandra Rojas and her husband, a veterinarian from San Jose, Costa Rica, were among those trying to leave. After loading their cars, they were going to drive to the Jalisco state capital of Guadalajara to plan their next move. \nThe hotel is saying that nothing is going to happen,” said Ms Rojas. “But it’s nature.

Source: AP \nIn Puerto Vallarta on Thursday, restaurants and stores taped or boarded-up windows, and residents raced to stores for last-minute purchases ahead of the storm. \nThe Hurricane Centre in Miami warned that preparations should be rushed to completion, saying the storm could cause coastal flooding, destructive waves and flash floods. \n“This is an extremely dangerous, potentially catastrophic hurricane,” centre meteorologist Dennis Feltgen said. \nMr Feltgen said Patricia also poses problems for Texas. Forecast models indicate that after the storm breaks up over land, remnants of its tropical moisture will likely combine with and contribute to heavy rainfall that is already soaking Texas independently of the hurricane, he said. \n“It’s only going to make a bad situation worse,” he said.

Source: Reuters \nWhy did Patricia become a monster so quickly? \nHurricane Patricia zoomed from tropical storm to record-beater in 30 hours flat like a jet-fuelled sports car. \nWhy? The Pacific storm had just the right ingredients. \nPlenty of warm water provided the energy what meteorologists call explosive intensification. The air was much moister than usual, adding yet more fuel. And at the same time, upper-level crosswinds — called shear — that restrain a hurricane from strengthening were missing for much of Thursday, meteorologists said. — Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) October 23, 2015 \n“I was really astounded,” said MIT meteorology professor Kerry Emanuel. \n“It was over the juiciest part of the eastern Pacific.” \nEl Nino’s fingerprints are all over this, meteorologists agreed. And while it fits perfectly into climate scientists’ theories of what a warming world will be like, they say global warming can’t quite be blamed — yet. \nAt 10pm EDT Wednesday (1pm Thursday AEDT), Patricia was a tropical storm off Mexico with 105km/h winds that forecasters expected to intensify rapidly. In fact, one forecast gave it a 97 per cent chance of getting stronger fast. \nBut it strengthened so quickly that many were surprised, said Robert Rogers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hurricane Research Division. \nBy 4am EDT Friday (7pm Friday AEDT) Patricia’s winds were a record for hurricanes: 321km/h. \n“Incredible. You don’t see many like this,” said former hurricane hunter meteorologist Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private Weather Underground. \n“In fact in the Western Hemisphere, we’ve never seen anything like this. ” Travelers scramble as #HurricanePatricia hurtles toward Mexico, images from the scene https://t.co/lTCue0tLsq pic.twitter.com/vyRXJES2jn — CNN (@CNN) October 23, 2015 \nWorldwide, this is the ninth Category 5 storm this year, which is tied for the second most on record, Masters said. Normal years are around five to six. A Category 5 storm has winds of 253km/h or higher. \nThe eastern and northern Pacific regions have had more tropical storms than usual this season; the Atlantic has had less. \nThat’s a classic signature of the weather pattern called El Nino — with warmer waters to feed storms and favourable winds in the Pacific and unfavourable winds in the Atlantic, Masters and others said. \nPatricia is being fuelled by near-record warm 87-degree Pacific waters at the surface that ran warm unusually deep. \nClimate science theory says that as the world warms, the most extreme storms will get even stronger and wetter. Patricia’s record strength is “consistent with what we say” but there are too few examples to make a scientifically accurate connection, Emanuel said. \nPatricia and Haiyan from 2013 may be “warning signs that, hey this could be the future,” Masters said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:51:17.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
