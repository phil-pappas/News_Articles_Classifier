A year after starting the company, founder René Lalique chose a location just down the street to build a stately home, which reopened on September 18 as the hotel and restaurant Villa René Lalique . Under construction since 2013, the project naturally embodies Lalique’s characteristic attention to detail. A new fine-dining restaurant features collaborations with Damien Hirst, Christofle, and Peugeot, and the design team behind Lalique’s 2011 collection of maison art deco furnishings and accessories executed the hotel rooms’ interiors. \nWhat to Expect: With just six suites, the villa focuses on quality over quantity. Lacquered bed frames and nightstands, as well as desks with crystal inlays, were individually designed for the art deco–inspired rooms, which start at about $400. Guests can sip cocktails in Lalique Maison Femme Ailée armchairs in the first-floor lounge or walk across the lawn to the modern Mario Botta–designed restaurant in the villa’s front yard. Chef Jean-Georges Klein, who earned three Michelin stars at the restaurant L’Arnsbourg, creates an unmatched fine-dining experience surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows. The restaurant’s basement level houses an extensive wine cellar, and sommelier Romain Iltis is available to recommend selections from the 20,000 bottles. Off property, area attractions include the 4-year-old Lalique museum, the historic Wingen-sur-Moder village, and Alsace’s picturesque capital city Strasbourg. \nHow to Get There: Fly into Strasbourg and reach the villa within an hour’s drive, or helicopter directly to the villa gardens. From Paris, it is about a 4-hour drive. ( villarenelalique.com )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:10:57.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
