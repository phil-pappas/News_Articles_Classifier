Recently opened by professional motivational speaker and life coach Godfrey Madanhire, you’re guaranteed to leave spiritually enlightened. While in the area, don’t forget to see the Eye of Kuruman, the largest natural spring in the southern hemisphere. Where the province meets the ocean Port Nolloth is the perfect year-round destination. Thanks to the cooling sea breeze, the immense temperatures experienced further inland don’t affect this sea side town. \nA beautiful spot to call home while exploring the exquisite west coast is the Bedrock Lodge , which is also an amazing piece of local history - having been built in 1855. Situated on the beachfront, you can enjoy uninterrupted ocean views. \nDue to its position, it also makes the perfect location to explore more of the north-western part of the province. In the surrounding areas you can go and discover the Ritcherveld National Park, experience the Namaqualand flower show, and drive to the Gariep River Mouth - the end of the Orange River. \nGet a taste of the eccentric under the stars Calvinia is situated in the Hantam Karoo in the bottom south-western district. Boasting an 80 percent starlit sky at night, with Sutherland just an hour’s drive away, stargazing is encouraged while in the area. \nGet the full experience of the area’s history by resting your head at Aletta’s Lodge . Exploring the town on foot will open a world of quirky side-street stores and oddities, like the 6.17metre high postbox. For those in search of a true winter wonderland adventure, take a trip to the neighbouring towns where you can play in the snow during the colder months. Hit the Diamond Fields Barkly West is a small town close to the capital of the province, Kimberley. Steeped in history, the town really came into its own during the diamond rush. \nTo this day you can still go on guided tours to pan for diamonds in the Vaal River. \nWhile in town stay at the unique Rooftop B&B , which is made from actual logs. A short trip from the main hub of the Northern Cape, visitors can engage with all the activities of the city centre and quickly escape back to the tranquil town in an easy day trip. Wine on the Orange To many reading this it might be surprising to learn that Upington has a booming wine industry, with the micro climate of the areas surrounding the river making it perfect to grow grapes. \nThe town is also within driving distance of the Augrabies Falls National Park and, within walking distance to river activities, this is the town to enjoy the finer things of the Northern Cape. There is no better place to escape the midday heat than at the Sunriver Kalahari Lodge , with two swimming pools on the premises, which are needed when temperatures can reach 40 degrees.
