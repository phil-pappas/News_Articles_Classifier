But the surroundings are very intimate not to mention opulent.\" Hide Caption 2 of 12 12 photos: And the airline offering the best inflight service is...

First class passengers can also use a dedicated shower.\" Hide Caption 3 of 12 12 photos: And the airline offering the best inflight service is...
