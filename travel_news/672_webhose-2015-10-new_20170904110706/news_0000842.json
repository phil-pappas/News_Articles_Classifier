All of them wave and shout “hello” as they walk past not only parents but also neighbors passing by.\n“When you build healthy relationships with students, with parents, with partners in the community, that's how transformation really takes place,” said Broughton.\nTrending on Facebook\nBride's father stops wedding so stepdad can walk her down the aisle, too Miracle baby' missing part of brain, skull celebrates first birthday New mom touched by plane passenger's heartwarming act of kindness 5 Facebook hoaxes and scams to watch out for Warning: An old Facebook scam is making the rounds again!
