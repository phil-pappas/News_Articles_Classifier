At the age of 65 this was his first train journey: after retiring he had decided to treat himself to a week in Bangkok followed by an overnight journey home to Malaysia. Fishing a tiny Pentax from his breast pocket, he slid over to the window and put one hand to the glass, his eyes following each rusted rooftop and billboard as it sailed past. His tangible delight reaffirmed my own love for train travel. No matter how many trains I boarded, windows I peered through, or doorways I sat in, each new journey was like a present waiting to be unwrapped. \n• The best hotels in Bangkok \nTrains leave for Butterworth from Hua Lamphong Train Station in Bangkok Photo: Hzh/Wikipedia \nWithin an hour the dust and concrete of the city had given way to waterlogged paddy fields lined with palms so bent they grew in diagonals, criss-crossing at the waist. Passengers slipped into comfy pyjamas and spread rugs across their knees. They peered into the baskets of vendors hawking chicken and bags of sticky rice, and slurped on carrier bags full of rambutan. \n• The world's best rail journeys \nAs afternoon blurred into evening, unread books lay face down on snoozing chests. Outside, the sun twinkled off the paddy, turning it to sheets of gold. Shivering in the air conditioning, I wandered into the vestibule and stood on the hinge of two carriages as they slid around, crashing against each other. Muggy air seeped in through the cracks and once I had thawed out I swayed down the corridor following the deep aroma of fried fish and lemon grass to the dining car. Here was the hub of activity: French tourists in baggy T-shirts smoked through the open windows of the wood-panelled car, and waiters in waistcoats arranged red trays on white table cloths. For 170 baht (£3), four set menus offered a main of fried pork in oyster sauce or stir-fried sea bass with celery, with a side dish of duck red curry or chicken green curry with jasmine rice and three firm pieces of pineapple for pudding. Stuffed, with my lips tingling from the dregs of chilli pork broth, I lingered until the sun had gone and the sky had darkened before winding my way back to my berth. \nFor a few baht buy a Thai green curry dish on board (AP) Photo: AP \nBedtime approached, and the guard arrived to push down the seats into one large berth, wide enough for two. This should have lent itself to a wonderful sleep had an attendant not called through the curtain at 6am to hand me a tray of steaming chicken congee sprinkled with diced spring onion and crisp shallots. But it was so delicious that all was forgiven and it was hard not to be drawn in and shaken awake by the scene outside the window of farms and lakes and villages setting up for the day. \nA second-class air-conditioned sleeper on the International Express from Bangkok to Butterworth costs about £25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:02:13.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
