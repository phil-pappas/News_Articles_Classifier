The service was developed in partnership with online car hire comparison site carrentals.co.uk providing simple online access to a choice of car hire companies at the airport, including a selection of premium and supercars.\nTo access the service customers simply log on to heathrow.com and enter their travel details to bring up the full range of prices, brands and vehicle options available. Customers will also be able to book for non-Heathrow car hire with other UK, European and global locations giving passengers the ability to plan a seamless journey from departure through to arrival at their destination.\nChris Annetts, Heathrow’s Commercial Passenger Services Director said:\n‘Heathrow’s goal is to provide the world’s best airport service and we believe offering customers a transparent way of comparing car hire options is a key step towards delivering this ambition. The carrentals.co.uk platform is based on a proven technology and has been seamless to implement and operate across the Heathrow estate.’\nGareth Robinson, CEO of ASAP Ventures Ltd, owners of the carrentals.co.uk brand, added:\n‘The technology and commercial platform for the service is well proven in the market place with over one million rentals to date, so it was a case of our developers customising the service to Heathrow’s specific needs. We are delighted that Heathrow has chosen our solution and look forward to a long and successful partnership.’\nIn addition to being able to get the best available deal on car hire, Heathrow’s car hire operators also provide a free, secure transit service between terminals and the car rental offices. Passengers travelling from Terminal 5 are also able to opt for delivery of vehicles direct to the terminal, with certain car rental operators. Future plans include the introduction of at-terminal car delivery across the Heathrow estate and the integration of the car hire comparison platform into the Heathrow app to give passengers even greater convenience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:04:00.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
