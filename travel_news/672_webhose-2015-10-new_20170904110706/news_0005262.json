I glanced up from my Kindle and then, without further ado, returned to my reading, nibbling on a piece of watermelon that had been brought to me on a tray.\nHad we been in Britain, health-and-safety hysteria would have seen me swimming out to save her but here, in the confines of the Daios Cove Luxury Resort & Villas in Crete, I felt as though nothing bad could happen.\nThis all-inclusive compound, built into a cliffside ten minutes from the ancient town of Agios Nikolaos, bills itself as a paradise for children, and with good reason.\nColourful: The busy inner harbour of Aghios Nikolaos in Crete, Greece, is located 10 minutes from the resort\nThere is a saltwater infinity pool, 39 villas and 261 suites — 165 with private pools — a kids’ club and three restaurants.\nBut the beating heart of the place is its beach and the calm, clear sea that laps at it. This protected bay is an aquatic playground for young ones.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next Here's why it's called the British ISLES: The little known...

Share this article Share 27 shares Wary at first, and, as Londoners, more accustomed to soulless swimming pools than open seas, my children came to revel in these warm, unthreatening waters.\nWithin a day of our arrival, my daughter Emilia was feeling emboldened enough to march over to the water sports area and sign out a pedalo. It was on this that I saw her pedalling my friend’s seven-year-old off towards the horizon.\nWe also frolicked on paddleboards (the stillness of the cove making this an ideal place to learn to SUP, or Stand Up Paddleboard), had waterskiing lessons with the endlessly patient Stefanos, who looped back time and again to scoop the children up as they collapsed into the sea, and were pulled along shrieking on an inflatable sofa.\nAt Daios Cove, allowing children some freedom and treating them not so differently to adults is encouraged. Whether this be putting calamari on the children’s menu or teaching them to scuba-dive, it is an attitude that makes for happy campers.\nChilds play: Milo, eight, and Emilia, nine, tucked into their ice cream while in the Crete seaside town\nWe did not take up the scuba-diving lessons, using our snorkels instead to observe the weever fish, razorfish and damselfish. Even my eight-year-old, Milo, less of a water-baby than his sister, was beguiled by the sea life.\nOn dry land, Milo also found plenty to do. There was the games room where he wiled away hours playing table tennis and air hockey with other boys. Even better were the tennis courts.\nBecause Daios is designed to blend into the cliff, it is set on many different levels, with the beach at the bottom, moving up to the pool, then spa, then kids’ club, with reception and the sleek new Crystal Box Bar (which makes a mean mojito) at the top. There is a glass funicular to ferry guests between the different levels.\nThe suites and villas, all with sea views, are spread along the cliffs and can be reached by golf buggy, an army of drivers on hand to shuttle guests.\nBy mid-week, the children were hailing the buggies themselves to rescue forgotten items.\nThe kids’ club was all-singing and all-dancing. Evening activities included talent shows, pyjama parties and a mini disco on the beach. Once, when we paid a visit, they were making chocolate truffles. In truth, however, we barely used it; there was so much they could do independently.\nOne day, we ventured to Agios Nikolaos. At its centre is a lake with a Byzantine church at one end and at the other a row of cafes (where the children had ice creams and my friend and I had cocktails).\nDespite Greece’s financial chaos, it appeared to be business as usual along the narrow streets, where shops peddled everything from designer sunglasses to Cretan artisan food.\nFrom Agios, we took a short boat ride to Spinalonga, a rocky islet with a 16th-century fortress — built by the Venetians, conquered by the Turks and a leper colony until 1957 (the last one in Europe). More recently, it was the setting for Victoria Hislop’s bestselling novel The Island.\nThere is no denying Daios Cove is an expensive holiday. The room rates are not for the faint-hearted. They say you can’t put a price on freedom, however, and seeing the children so elated with their (reassuringly sheltered) independence made it worth every penny.\nTRAVEL FACTS ITC Luxury Travel (01244 355 527, itcluxurytravel.co.uk ) offers seven nights half-board from £5,919 per family based on two adults and two children in a One Bedroom Suite with Sea View, including easyJet return flights from Gatwick, private transfers.\nRead more: Luxury Holidays| Luxury Travel| Luxury Hotels| ITC Luxury Travel", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LcfWnM", "http://itcluxurytravel.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:12:11.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
