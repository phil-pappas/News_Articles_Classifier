The conference is an ideal opportunity for them to network and do business with each other, as well as discuss the industry’s strategic challenges. It is just one of ERA’s many annual events that allow members to identify and address common industry opportunities and threats.\n“ERA members provide a vital economic and social service and contribute in the region of €47bn to Europe’s GDP. As an established and respected aviation association we are committed to ensuring that this contribution is recognised and supported through our lobbying and communication campaigns,” adds McNamara.\nThe ERA annual airline and airport awards will be announced at the prestigious gala dinner on 14 October and the event closes on 15 October with the annual general meeting where a number of new board member elections will be announced.\nAccredited media are invited to attend the conference, news conferences and media-specific receptions, and organise one-on-one interviews with the expert market commentators attending the event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:39:05.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
