The tale has been embellished by more than a century of history, hyperbole, lies and, more recently, Internet conjecture. Enough already. Search-and-rescue teams have covered enough ground in the Supes to know that the only things lost out there are people looking for the mine.\nIt's easy to explore the Superstitions without becoming a rescue mission. They are a great place to hike, drive, camp and learn history, and they're right in our backyard. Here are places to get started.\nFind out more\nGuidebooks: Local authors Jack Carlson and Elizabeth Stewart have written the definitive guides to hiking and horseback riding in the Supes. \"Superstition Wilderness Trails West\" and \"Superstition Wilderness Trails East\" are a wealth of information on the trails, legends and history of the region. Find them in bookstores, online sellers or at clearcreekpublishing.com.\nOnline: The Tonto National Forest website has loads of information for hikers and equestrians.

Keep an eye out for wildlife if you hike in the morning or late in the afternoon. Be aware that the trails connect to longer trails, such as Jacobs Crosscut and Siphon Draw, that can lead you out of the park and into the wilderness. The park is a reliable place to see spring wildflowers.\nFacilities include a visitor center and gift shop, picnic ramadas with grills, 134 campsites for tents and RVs, restrooms and showers. Campsites with electric hookups cost $25-$30 per night; campsites without cost $15-$17. Reservations can be made online.\nThe park hosts many activities in fall, winter and spring. Among the popular offerings are guided hikes and stargazing events. See a schedule online.\nDetails: 6109 N. Apache Trail, Apache Junction. $7 per vehicle; $3 for bikes. 480-982-4485, azstateparks.com/parks/LODU .\nApache Trail\nThis historical road covers 46 miles from Apache Junction to Roosevelt Dam. It was built to supply crews working on the dam, one of the country's first reclamation projects. Once the dam was built, the road was billed as a tourist attraction because of its stunning views of the Superstitions. It is still a popular getaway, with parks, trails and lakes along the way. The upper portion of the road is gravel but fine for cars. The road is listed as a Historic Road by the Arizona Department of Transportation.\nTo drive the Apache Trail from west to east, take U.S. 60 to exit 196, State Route 88/Idaho Road and turn north (left). Drive about 2.3 miles and take the right fork to get on SR 88 (Apache Trail). Turn east and follow the road to the dam, at the junction of SR 88 and 188. To drive it from east to west, take U.S. 60 east to Globe, then SR 188 northwest to SR 88. Turn west and take the Apache Trail back to Apache Junction.\nTortilla Flat\nThis tourist watering hole on the Apache Trail got its start as a freight camp during construction of Roosevelt Dam. It's a fun, kitschy place to have a meal, beverage or ice cream. If you're coming from the west, you should know that the pavement ends not long after Tortilla Flat, but some of the area's best scenery awaits.\nDetails: 18 miles east of Apache Junction on the Apache Trail. 480-984-1776, tortillaflataz.com .\nTonto National Monument\nThe monument preserves remnants of the Salado culture, which shared cultural aspects of ancient Pueblo and Hohokam villages to the west. The Salado people grew corn, beans, squash and cotton along the Salt River and produced a polychrome style of pottery that set them apart from other native cultures.\nThe lower cliff dwelling is open for self-guided tours all year. The upper dwelling is open from November through April and can be seen only by guided tour. The tour covers 3 miles and lasts three to four hours. There is no extra charge, but reservations are required. Wildflower and photo tours are frequently offered in the spring.\nDetails: 8 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. Closed on Christmas. The monument is about 110 miles from central Phoenix. Take U.S. 60 east to Globe/Miami. Turn left on SR 188 and go 25 miles northwest to the signed entrance. $3; free for age 15 or younger. 928-467-2241, www.nps.gov/tont .\nSuperstition Mountain Museum\nThe museum displays the artifacts, history and folklore of the Superstition Mountains, Apache Junction and vicinity. There are exhibits on ranching, mining, geology, Native American history, the Lost Dutchman Mine, Roosevelt Dam and more.\nThe museum sprawls across 12 acres and includes a self-guided nature trail, a mill and lots of memorabilia, including the Elvis Presley Memorial Chapel, an artifact from when \"the King\" filmed the movie \"Charro\" in the area in 1968. An exhibit showcasing the work of artist Ted DeGrazia will be on display until April 9.\nDetails: 9 a.m.-4 p.m. daily. 4087 N. Apache Trail, Apache Junction. $5; $4 for age 55 or older; free for age 17 or younger. 480-983-4888, superstitionmountainmuseum.org .\nGoldfield Ghost Town\nGoldfield once was quite the bustling burg, complete with a general store, blacksmith shop, schoolhouse and three saloons. During its heyday in the 1890s, it even looked as if the upstart mining town, nestled between the Superstition Mountains and the Goldfield Mountains, might grow bigger than Mesa, its neighbor to the west.\nBut when the ore quality dropped, the boomtown went bust and its population plummeted.\nToday Goldfield (actually a re-creation) lives, featuring all manner of Western-themed activities, shops and restaurants. Visitors can tour the Mammoth Gold Mine, pan for gold, take a ride on a narrow-gauge railroad and witness an Old West gunfight.\nDetails: 10 a.m.-5 p.m. daily. 4650 N. Mammoth Mine Road, Goldfield. Free to visit; fees for activities. 480-983-0333, goldfieldghosttown.com .\nHikers on the Peralta Trail in the Superstition Wilderness east of Phoenix. (Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic )\nPeralta Trailhead\nThis is one of the most popular and easily accessible trailhead areas. It's at the end of Peralta Road, about 8 miles east of Apache Junction on U.S. 60. Part of the road is graded dirt and fine for cars. The trailhead has a parking area with a pit toilet. No water is available.\nFrom the trailhead, the Peralta, Bluff Spring and Dutchman's trails connect with other routes and will take you as deep as you like. Those who want to see the wilderness should have a map. Those who do not want to see the wilderness should definitely have a map — the crisscrossing routes can be confusing.\nThe Peralta Trail is easy to follow and leads to a fantastic view of Weavers Needle. It's short and sweet — a little more than a mile one way, uphill but not too steep — and is often crowded. The Dutchman's Trail works its way east after climbing away from the parking lot. It then eases into a series of rolling hills and connects to other trails, such as Whiskey Spring and Coffee Flat. The Bluff Spring Trail is steep and rocky and not recommended for horses.\nFirst Water Trailhead\nThis popular trailhead is a short distance east of Lost Dutchman State Park along the Apache Trail. It has a pit toilet but no water.\nYou can do anything from a short stroll to a multiday backpack. Popular day-hike destinations are Hackberry Spring and Boulder Canyon. You get great views of Weavers Needle from the Black Mesa Trail.\nEastern Supes\nNumerous less-known, less-used trails await those willing to drive past Superior. Some are well-defined; others have fallen into disrepair and navigation can be tricky. The area is best suited for experienced, well-equipped hikers. Use caution, read a map and pay attention to landmarks. Those who do so will be rewarded with beautiful views and more solitude.\nRoger Naylor contributed to this article.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/Phoenix/2014/10/13/pni1014superstitions3.jpg", "http://www.nps.gov/tont", "http://azstateparks.com/parks/LODU", "http://www.fs.usda.gov/tonto", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4865f1f075ae407bd381059588e680dcd5efef28/c=0-0-2128-1600&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/Phoenix/2014/10/13/pni1014superstitions3.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/Phoenix/2014/10/13/pni1014superstitions3.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cd882c5b275f5d7bfe5f1894443069a7529e990c/c=0-248-4610-2853&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Phoenix/None/2014/10/20/635494168344470006-phxdc5-6hj78ygnrvm1maeusnl7-original.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:35:28.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
