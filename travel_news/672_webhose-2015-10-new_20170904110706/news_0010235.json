In a year when we have transported record numbers of passengers, we have also managed to significantly reduce our environmental impact.”\nHe added: “Whether you are a manufacturer based in Rochdale, a start-up company in the London-to-Cambridge corridor or employed in the transport industry in the Midlands, our airports help you tap into the global marketplace and unlock your company’s potential.\n“Not only does a nationwide network of competing airports provide the best solution for customers, but it also provides an important catalyst for re-balancing UK PLC.”\nEarlier this week, Heathrow published images of what its third runway will look if its selected by the government for expansion.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:31:35.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
