Comment By Bill Van SiclenJournal Arts Writer Posted Oct. 1, 2015 @ 12:01 am It’s no secret that Block Island is a great place to visit in the summer. But the fall is also a great time to spend a day or a weekend on Rhode Island’s very own Key West (although you may want to check the weather this weekend, depending on the fate of Hurricane Joaquin). Last week, I had a chance to spend a few hours on the island — long enough to revisit old haunts like the Southeast Light and Mohegan Bluffs while discovering new favorites such as Persephone's Kitchen & Cafe, a place that deserves serious consideration on anyone's list of best coffeehouses in Rhode Island. 1. Persephone's Kitchen & Cafe For years, the best way to start a day on Block Island was to stop by Juice 'n Java, a tiny hole-in-the-wall place that served up freshly made coffee, smoothies and pastries to a mostly local clientele. So when the cafe's owners announced they were closing earlier this year, coffee lovers across the island (and beyond) were understandably worried. Fortunately, help arrived in the form of Persephone Brown, a Block Island baker and businesswoman who opened her own cafe and coffeehouse in the same space vacated by Juice 'n Java. Like its illustrious predecessor, Persephone's Kitchen & Cafe makes a great cup of coffee, along with assorted teas, chais and specialty coffee drinks. (I can personally vouch for the cafe's cappuccino, which arrived with just the right mix of freshly brewed espresso and frothy steamed milk.) Visitors can also fortify themselves with a large selection of house-made pastries and baked goods, including health-conscious options such as gluten-free brownies and banana bread. For lunch, there's always a fresh soup of the day and an excellent kale salad made with strawberries, almonds and honey-infused balsamic vinegar. The only drawback: Persephone's has such a cozy, laid-back vibe that it's easy to spend a couple of hours here, leaving less time to explore the rest of the island. So beware! 235 Dodge Street, (401) 595-7032, persephoneskitchenbi.com . Hours: Mon.-Fri. 7-noon, Sat.-Sun. noon-2, through Columbus Day. 2. Southeast Light/Mohegan Bluffs Built in 1874, Block Island's historic Southeast Light is noteworthy both for its spectacular location high atop the Mohegan Bluffs and for its picturesque Gothic Revival design. (Of special note: the striking octagonal lighthouse tower, which rises more than 50 feet above the bluffs and houses a traditional fresnel lens salvaged from another historic lighthouse — North Carolina's Cape Lookout Lighthouse.) In 1993, Southeast Light was involved in one of the most ambitious preservation efforts in the state's history, when the entire structure was moved 300 feet inland to protect it from ongoing coastal erosion. Designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1997, it's also a great place to start a tour of the island, since both the lighthouse and the nearby bluffs are within easy biking (and relatively easy walking) distance of the harbor. One caveat: while the grounds are open year-round, the lighthouse itself is open weekends from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. through Columbus Day. 122 Mohegan Trail. 3. Block Island Historical Society Did you know that Block Island is named for Adrian Block, a Dutch explorer who visited the island in 1614? Or that the island was once part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony? Or that the earliest Native American settlement on the island dates back more than 3,000 years? If your knowledge of Block Island history could use some brushing up, the Block Island Historical Society is happy to oblige. In the same sense that the Smithsonian Institution is \"America's Attic,\" the historical society functions as the island's sea chest — the place to go for information on the area's early history (it was originally claimed by the Niantics, who called it \"Manisses\" or \"little island of Manitou\"), its role in military conflicts from the Revolutionary War to World War II and its emergence as a fashionable Victorian-era resort and summer colony in the 19th century. Located in (where else?) a historic house near the corner of Ocean Avenue and Old Town Road, the society has exhibits devoted to local farming practices, resort architecture, 19th-century resort fashions and the building of the Block Island breakwater, among other topics. There's also a gift shop that sells prints, posters and books relating to Block Island history. 18 Old Town Rd., (401) 864-4357. Hours: Sat.-Sun. noon-4 through Nov. 1 (weekdays by appointment). 4. Mohegan Cafe & Brewery From humble clam shacks to fancy hotel dining rooms, Block Island has no shortage of places to eat. The challenge is finding one that suits your mood, schedule and budget. After mulling my options, I chose Mohegan Cafe & Brewery for two reasons. First, it's conveniently located on what amounts to the island's main drag, Water Street, with views of both the harbor area and Block Island Sound. Second, after a busy morning of biking around the southern end of the island, the prospect of sampling one of the cafe's house-made beers and ales definitely sounded appealing. Not surprisingly, the lunch menu featured plenty of seafood entries, including a lobster bisque soup of the day, fried calamari and smoked salmon appetizers and a blackened mahi mahi sandwich. Other options included basic pub fare such as nachos, burgers and sandwich wraps. As for liquid refreshment, the cafe serves a variety of reasonably priced beers, wines and soft drinks, along with a house-made pilsner, wheat beer and a non-alcoholic ginger beer. In the end, I opted for one of the seafood specials — batter-fried fish 'n chips — and ordered one of the cafe's homebrews, an India Pale Ale, to go with it. Both were delicious. Since I was headed out to the north end of the island after lunch, I decided to skip dessert, although the cafe's freshly made cheesecake and ganache-infused chocolate cake did look tempting. And besides, I could always have a late-afternoon snack after I got back. 213 Water Street, (401) 466-5911. Open daily 11:30 a.m.-9 p.m., through Oct. 18. 5. Block Island National Wildlife Refuge For a place that only measures about 10 square miles, Block Island features a surprising number of nature preserves and wildlife refuges. On the south side of the island, the 230-acre Rodman's Hollow preserve is home to a number of rare and endangered species, including the Northern Harrier, a member of the hawk family, and the only known colony of American burying beetles east of the Mississippi. The area, which is close to popular tourist spots such as the Southeast Light and Mohegan Bluffs, also features a number of nature trails and hiking paths — notably the Block Island Greenway, a 15-mile network of trails that winds through Rodman's Hollow and several other small parks and nature preserves. On the north side of the island, both the 127-acre Block Island National Wildlife Refuge and the 25-acre Hodge Family Wildlife Preserve are popular bird-watching spots. In fact, fall is prime bird-watching time on Block Island, when dozens of species, including many different kinds of songbirds, use the island as a pit stop on their way south for the winter. For casual bird-watchers, a sturdy rental bike and a pair of good binoculars is all that's needed. For more serious \"birders,\" there's the annual Audubon Birding Weekend, a three-day bird-watching binge hosted by the Audubon Society of Rhode Island. (Unfortunately, registration is closed for this year's event.) Corn Neck Road, (401) 364-9124. Open year-round. 6. Aldo's Bakery Part of an empire that also includes a restaurant/pizzeria and a bike and moped rental business, Aldo's Bakery is known for both its mouth-watering cakes and pastries and its luscious ice creams and Italian-style gelatos. Considering its proximity to the New Shoreham ferry terminal and most of the big hotels, it's also a great place to grab a mid-afternoon bite after a long day of biking, hiking or just lounging around on the beach. Certainly, the two scoops of gelato I ordered — one Pistachio, one Toasted Coconut Almond — hit the spot after a long day of sightseeing. Even better: the next time I visit Block Island, I can choose from 25 more gelato flavors, including intriguing-sounding options such as Salted Caramel Pretzel and Flaming Italian Coffee. 130 Weldons Way, (401) 466-2198, aldosbakery.com .
