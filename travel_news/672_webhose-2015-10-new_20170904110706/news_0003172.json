Clearly, the impact of pressure from across the north has made the government act. Yet this 'temporary' pause has led to a very real, permanent delay. With work originally due to be completed by 2019, the delay to 2022 gives passengers three more years of a slow and overcrowded service. We know that 13% of people have to stand on the Transpennine Express each morning, meaning workers and residents in Leeds are having to pay a first-class price for a second-class service.\nClearly passengers won’t want to accept any further delays to this project. People in the north deserve a fairer share of the transport funds available nationally and we will continue to make the case for more investment and more freedom to secure a better deal for our region. We need to see more happening, and at a far greater pace, for the Northern Powerhouse vision to become a reality.\n– Leader of Leeds City Council Councillor Judith Blake Last updated Wed 30 Sep 2015 Read more 4 updates TransPennine electrification works to resume Travel Hull Sheffield York North Yorkshire Lincolnshire Leeds South Yorkshire East Yorkshire West Yorkshire North Lincolnshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T12:36:47.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
