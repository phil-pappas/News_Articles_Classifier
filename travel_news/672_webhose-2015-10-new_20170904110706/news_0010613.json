Talpazan was eight years old when, by his own account, a “beautiful blue light of energy” descended from the sky upon his home village of Maineasca. After enveloping him briefly, it disappeared, leaving him convinced of its extraterrestrial origins. Four years later, he began to draw what he had witnessed. It was the start of a collection would eventually comprise more than 1,000 artworks. Some were meticulous diagrams of the ships’ inner workings, each individual segment filled in with a different colour. Others were positively psychedelic, patterned with swirling dots and eye-like nebulae. Talpazan would often inscribe his own notes and theories around the edges of an image or right across the surface, using an almost indecipherable hybrid of Romanian and English. In 1987, at the height of Nicolae Ceaușescu’s regime, he fled Romania by swimming across the Danube. After being granted asylum as a political refugee he settled in New York and continued drawing. At times he lived and worked on the street; as his fortunes improved, his one-room flat in Harlem filled up with artwork. In later life Talpazan would incorporate images of his experience as an outsider in America, overlaying his saucers with the stars and stripes or the Statue of Liberty. His repertoire expanded to include smooth plaster sculptures, mounted on blue pedestals to represent the blue light of his childhood. Their purpose, however, was always meant to be instructive as well as creative. Talpazan maintained that he had caught a glimpse of a method for harnessing cosmic forces to the benefit of mankind. “My dream is to collaborate with researchers at Nasa,” he explained. “My work is a combination of art and science.” Though Nasa never took an interest, local art dealers were more forthcoming. A dozen of his paintings covered a wall at a 1996 show in Manhattan’s American Primitive Gallery. His work featured in the Museum of Everything in Paris, and in the Hayward Gallery’s Alternative Guide to the Universe exhibition on London’s Southbank. “The artist is like an astronaut”, Talpazan told a BBC interviewer in 2013. “With the mind, you can travel the entire universe.” Ionel Talpazan was born on August 16 1955 in the Romanian commune of Petrachioaia. His parents sold him to another couple when he was a baby, and his upbringing thereafter remained unhappy. His foster mother drank heavily, and there were regular beatings. The “blue light of energy” that would transform his life visited him while he was hiding outside the house to escape one such punishment. He began selling his drawings at the Outsider Art Fair in Lower Manhattan’s SoHo, choosing to stand in the street rather than occupy a booth in the fair itself. Consequently, the pieces often sold for a fraction of what some dealers in outsider art considered their market value. Even with his growing success into the new millennium, Talpazan refused to produce work on commission. He owned no telephone or computer, leaving people to track him down at his apartment. On receiving American citizenship towards the end of his life, Ionel Talpazan changed his name to Adrian da Vinci. He is survived by four siblings.
