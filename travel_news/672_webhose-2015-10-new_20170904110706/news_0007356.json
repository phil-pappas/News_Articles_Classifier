USA, 16 October 2015 -- From the rapidly rising number of the people riding an Airwheel electric scooter on the road, it could be apparently seen what great popularity it has enjoyed. Why the Airwheel intelligent scooter is a cutting-edged means of transportation and how it would change one’s view of the world will be clearly demonstrated in this article.The word “cutting-edged” indicates, in some way, that the Airwheel self-balancing scooter , as a form of commuting, is distinct from other vehicles on the street. To begin with, it is a kind of vehicles which could take one from one place to another with its one wheel. Differing from a car or a bus, which move on wheels as well, it is not directed by the moving of the steering wheel, but by the slight tilting of one’s body instead. It is cool and fashionable, which could give one a chance to be the centre of the public’s attention. More importantly, riding an intelligent scooter out is comparatively more environmentally friendly than driving a car or taking a taxi. While the cars and buses are powered by fuel, which would consequently emit different kinds of hazardous gases polluting the air we hale in every day, the scooter, however, is powered by the rechargeable battery and directed by the leaning of its user’s body. No populations will be caused in riding one. And it makes a scooter a state-out-of-art means of transportation in essence. Last but not least, there is no exaggeration to say that an Airwheel electric scooter might change one’s view of the world to some extent. When one is driving a car, he is restricted within a enclosed space and all his attention will be paid to whatever might happen on the road. Yet on a scooter, one could get closer to the nature that has nurtured him since his birth and know better of the world he is living in. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:14:11.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
