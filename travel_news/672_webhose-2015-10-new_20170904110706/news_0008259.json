Tomas, our guide and ostensibly our protector, sends a toot up my other nostril and the maloka — an aboriginal cabin in Colombia — begins to spin gently.\nThe shaman’s friend sits in the shadows, sporting a face-cracking grin. My anxiety revs into the red because somewhere behind me there’s a venomous crab spider, a nightmare-inducing creature that resembles a daddy longlegs with greater body mass and possibly knives attached to its front two appendages.\n“Don’t stand up,” Tomas says.\n“Don’t worry,” I tell him.\nThis is how four days in the Amazon jungle of southern Colombia begins.\n\n\nGabriel García Márquez , the brilliant Colombian novelist, wrote, “What matters in life is not what happens to you, but what you remember and how you remember it.”\nLike its flag — three bars featuring three primary colors — Colombia lends itself to brightly colored memories that hardly need embellishment to come across as brilliant. But then, García Márquez had a particular gift for embellishment. My family’s sojourn through the country was sufficiently wondrous and miserable on its own, two weeks of guided travel that included a muddy four days in the jungle, a grueling four days hiking through mountains and the remainder of the time in two very different cities.\nDuring the first portion of our trip, in the jungle along the Amazon River, Tomas does more than perform shamanic rituals. He ferrets out tarantulas, poison frogs and hunter snakes, points out falcons and toucans, and says the grumbling we heard one night was a pair of jaguars approaching our camp. Presumably the mosquito nets that covered our hammocks served as a wrapper that made us not worth the cats’ trouble.\nTomas adds that he sleeps with a knife, which is only partially reassuring.\nThe next day takes us down the Amazon past Brazil and into Peru, where Tomas drops a baited hook into a tributary of the mighty river and splashes the tip of his makeshift rod in the water.\n“In the year of the cat,” he sings, having earlier revealed an affinity for ’70s soft rock.\nBefore he gets to “She doesn’t give you time for questions,” a red piranha thrashes from the end of the line. After sunset the fish will be dinner. Then early the next morning, we’ll take a slow trip back up the river to Leticia, off to another part of the country.\n\n\nBogota contrasts with the jungle in every way.\nIn the jungle, humidity is such that wet clothes can’t be dried. The capital city, meanwhile, possesses a lovely mild climate, thanks to its elevation, and as Colombian locales go, it also contains fewer venomous and poisonous entities.\nBogota is a stimulating joy to discover on foot. It’s a city in transition, where vertical surfaces once tagged by tangles of graffiti are increasingly covered in bold and imaginative street art.\nThe city has a number of interesting museums, not the least of which is the Museo Historico de la Policia, which documents the history of the country’s police force with a particularly proud emphasis on the crackdown against the violent drug cartels and kidnappers who for so long gave the country an undesirable international reputation. A graph in the museum shows kidnappings having fallen from thousands to a few dozen, a crucial development in Colombia’s perception as a travel destination.\nLa Candelaria, the historic old-town section of Bogota, exudes youthful energy, thanks to more than 20 universities in the area. Restaurants, bars and museums all are located in this central part of the city, which is near both the Casa Museo Quinta de Bolivar, Simón Bolivar’s former home turned museum, and the funicular (cable car) that takes crowds up Cerro de Monserrate , one of the mountains that frames the city.\nThere are other ways up Cerro de Monserrate, which peaks about 10,000 feet above sea level, but I can’t recommend them. Pilgrims travel up the mountain to see “El Señor Caído,” the Fallen Christ, a statue of Jesus being removed from the cross. The penitent have been known to make the trek on their knees or with rocks placed deliberately in their shoes. Their mission has less to do with experiencing the arresting view from the chapel that sits atop the peak.\nThe Chorro de Quevedo, a fountain in the old town, is widely regarded as the site where Bogota was founded, just steps from a narrow alley where a few chicherías serve the beloved fermented corn beverage chicha .\nNavigating Bogota with a plan is advisable, but only if room is left for improvisation and discovery. One main street in the old part of town on a Saturday night was closed to traffic. Musicians and magicians performed, street food abounded, and peddlers peddled everything from paintings to crafts to fútbol jerseys. In Colombia a jersey bearing the name “James” has nothing to do with the surname of a peripatetic Ohioan who plays basketball. Unlike the divisive standing of LeBron James in the States, James Rodriguez , if judged by the jerseys, enjoys unanimous reverence among Colombians.\nOne strip of street hosted games of chance involving guinea pigs. Passersby could bet on which of a dozen numbered boxes a pig would run into. Odds seemed to favor the house.\n\n\nIf the Amazon offered nature and Bogota offered an urban experience, a trip to Ciudad Perdida was supposed to be the anthropological leg of our visit.\nNestled in the northern reaches of Colombia in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range (rather than the Andes, the biggest range in Colombia), the Lost City was known to local tribes like the Wiwas and Koguis, though it wasn’t “discovered” until 1972. The site predates Machu Picchu by more than half a millennium, and while only a small portion of it has been uncovered, its elevation of about 4,000 feet makes it a gorgeous destination.\nGetting there is the trouble.\nReaching Ciudad Perdida is the sort of endurance test that separates adventure trekkers from general travelers interested in ancient civilizations. The unforgiving path winds up and down mountains with only a few hundred yards of flat space over four days. My party wasn’t particularly well prepared, admittedly, with one of us a year out from ACL surgery and another who was, well, 9. Still, the discrepancy between the distance as advertised and my pedometer’s reading was startling.\nThe hike was billed as 28 miles from the beginning of the trail (about an hour’s drive from Santa Marta) and back, though my device tallied it as 28 miles each way. (That’s 119,000 steps, Fitbit folks.) Not insurmountable, but with steep grades, muddy hills and loose rocks, compressed into four days, the trek proved devastating on body and psyche alike. With the exception of a coral snake another tour guide killed, wildlife was minimal, as was information about the culture that built such a remarkable city.\nOur mumbling, muttering guide failed to explain the role of the mamo — a spiritual guide — in the tribal culture, so for a short time I thought he’d said, “The mammals sat inside the temple, but the people were not permitted to enter, so they sat outside.”\nAnd why shouldn’t mammals have their own little spiritual place?\nIt wasn’t until we met a 94-year-old Wiwa “mammal” on the trail who had an infant daughter with a twentysomething wife that it all clicked in my exhausted, faintly amused mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:53:06.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
