There is a real concern within the industry that a further cut in this Spending Round – to an already modest budget – will have a serious impact on vital services.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:56:56.045+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
