Passionate about supporting and protecting the environment, Six Senses Con Dao’s demonstrated commitment to sustainability has been recognized as one of the world’s top eco lodges by National Geographic Traveler. \nSix Senses Resort is delighted to announce the opening of Six Senses Con Dao Resort , the first 5 star resort in the archipelago islands. True to Six Senses philosophy of selecting remote (but accessible) destinations in areas of outstanding natural beauty, Con Dao is an untouched and breathtakingly beautiful area, protected for decades as a national and marine park. Six Senses Con Dao is reached by daily flights, of just 45 minutes, from Ho Chi Minh City. With a passionate commitment to supporting and protecting the environment, Con Dao has been built with the very lightest ecological footprint. Six Senses Con Dao's 50 villas sit up along a mile of sandy beach, sheltered by the green forested hills behind and with stunning vistas of the deep blue sea and the curve of the bay. All building materials are from natural, sustainable sources and local where possible. The teak is reclaimed from the Vietnamese interior and includes more than a thousand beautifully carved antique panels. \nAt present, the Saigon-Con Dao is the best of the few hotels on Con Son island. Its 26 rooms are in several old French villas built in 1921, refurbished in 1997 and now showing their age. However, its Vietnamese holding company is commencing a major upgrade to a 100 rooms with modern facilities. \nSaigon Condao Resort also offers many facilities to enrich your stay in Con Dao Islands (Vung Tau). The hotel offers access to a vast array of services, including car park, coffee shop, salon, elevator, business center. Saigon Condao Resort is home to 108 bedrooms, all tastefully furnished to provide comforts such as in room safe, separate shower and tub, bathrobes, balcony/terrace, television. The complete list of recreational facilities is available at the hotel, including jacuzzi, pool (kids), garden, sauna, tennis courts. With an ideal location and facilities to match, Saigon Condao Resort hits the spot in many ways. \nAt present, the standard rooms are very basic, with large tiled bathrooms, blankets rather than sheets, and poor quality furnishings and fittings. Deluxe rooms are better, with cotton upper sheets and a separate toilet and bathroom. However, the room is long and thin, requiring the television to be hung on a high bracket on the wall opposite the bed. Suite rooms have a large sitting area with a smaller bedroom, a basic bathroom and a large-screen television.
