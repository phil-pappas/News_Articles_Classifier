This is the third year that the event will take place at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Eugene (UUCE), located at 1685 West 13th Avenue Eugene, Oregon, from 5:00-9:00 p.m. The affair features live music and endless Coconut Bliss sundaes, and is open to the public with a suggested donation of $10-$25 per person or $25-$50 per family. All proceeds go to support the work of two local non-profit organizations: Beyond Toxics and Glorybee’s Save the Bee . Last year the event raised over $8900 for two selected beneficiaries.\nHighlights of the evening include a raffle and silent auction with goods and services provided by many local artisans and businesses. Small bites and other vegan appetizers prepared by a local chef will also be offered. Activities for children include face painting with all-natural dyes, an activity room sponsored by Rainbow Garden School, and more. All are welcome to come enjoy this blissful community event of giving.", "external_links": ["http://coconutbliss.com/", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5iZXlvbmR0b3hpY3Mub3JnLw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2NvY29udXRibGlzcy5jb20v", "http://www.glorybee.com/savethebee", "http://www.beyondtoxics.org/", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5nbG9yeWJlZS5jb20vc2F2ZXRoZWJlZQ==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2NvY29udXRibGlzcy5jb20vZXZlbnQvYS1uaWdodC1vZi1ibGlzcy8=", "http://coconutbliss.com/event/a-night-of-bliss/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:48:37.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
