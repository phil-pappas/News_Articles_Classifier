It was also noted that the design demonstrated originality and flair, distinctiveness, relevance, and practicality of use.\nBased in Edinburgh, Maria is originally from Huesca in North-Eastern Spain and works as a volunteer designer with Decagram – a co-operative of bands, solo musicians, film makers and artists. Maria has also worked for CQTC Branding Talent which works to promote creativity in all its forms and focuses its energy on projects that have a positive impact on communities and residents.\nTourism Minister, Fergus Ewing said:\n“Congratulations to Maria for winning a competition that had so many fantastic designs. The 2016 Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design is a wonderful opportunity for the tourism and events industry to come together to welcome visitors in a celebration of Scotland’s ground-breaking scientists, philosophers, engineers, architects and many more throughout the country.\n“It also a chance for us all to work together in shining a spotlight on emerging contemporary talent under the three themes and I’m therefore delighted that this competition gave a new opportunity to young designers to create a logo which will used by VisitScotland and partner organisations throughout 2016.”\nCharlie Smith, Director of Marketing at VisitScotland and competition judge said :\n“We had a number of really exciting entries for this competition but Maria’s logo really stood out from the rest in terms of originality, relevance and inventiveness. This marque has given a strong identity to the 2016 Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design and we look forward to using it across our campaigns for this inspirational year.”\nGraphic Designer and 2016 Logo Winner Maria said:\n“I wanted my design to reflect both the contemporary nature of what the 2016 Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design stands for, but I was also keen to take inspiration from other wider aspects of art and design which I’m interested in, and of course from Scotland itself which is an amazing mixture of busy vibrant cities and wonderful panoramic green space.\n“Having lived in Scotland for over a year, I’m constantly influenced by the landscapes, the people, the changing colours and the personality of the people and it’s exciting to think my design might help capture the interest of visitors from across the world to come and visit this wonderful country during 2016. It is a huge honour to see my design used to promote Scotland throughout 2016 and it’s exciting to have a new addition for my portfolio.”\n“The £3,000 prize fund is a great way for me to expand my own professional development and it has also been a fantastic experience getting the chance to work with the VisitScotland team on finalised brand guidelines.”\nThe logo competition launched in June 2015, invited young design talent from across Scotland to create a design that reflected the objectives of the Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design. From textiles to technology, architecture to fashion and design, the year-long programme of events, festivals, business conferences and exhibitions will shine the spotlight on Scotland’s greatest assets and icons, as well as unique hidden gems.\nMaria will see her design used by VisitScotland across all marketing and PR campaigns promoting 2016. The design will also be carried across a programme of major and special events due to take place throughout 2016 including the Festival of Architecture 2016.\nThe official media launch of the Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design will be in November 2015.\nSource:- Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:20:50.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
