This impressive site is scheduled to be completed and scheduled to open in the 2nd quarter of 2016. It will be a first-class state of the art international conference center that will house meeting rooms, exhibition halls, restaurants, retail space, parking facilities and an amphitheater that will accommodate over 6,000 delegates. \nThe total capacity of the CIC is approximately 10,000 people and the configuration of the space allows the CIC to host multiple events at the same time. Already the CIC is sure to put Algiers on the map as a premier conference destination in North Africa and the Middle East.
