So you need to act fast. If you have supplied goods and materials to the customer that have not yet been paid for, check your contract to see if it includes a retention of contract clause. If it does, you are entitled to reclaim them. Don’t wait for the legal process to sort it out – get round there immediately with a van, and collect the goods and materials that are yours. If the customer has gone under owing you money, you need to deal with the bad debt. If you have trade insurance in place, you can put in a claim for the money you are owed. If you don’t, contact the administrator acting on behalf of your customer to find out exactly what the situation is – whether the company will be restructured and how much money you can expect to get back. If there are significant sums involved, you should consider hiring an insolvency practitioner who can deal with the process for you and attend creditors’ meetings on your behalf. You then need to assess the impact of losing the customer on your turnover and profitability – and how easy it will be to replace that lost business elsewhere. Your priority must be your short-term cash position – without this being under control, you cannot make long-term plans. If you need an injection of cash to help your cashflow in the short term, consider invoice factoring or discounting. Banks are unlikely to lend to you unless you offer personal guarantees – which means that if your business does not survive, you could lose your home too. Beware. If it is not going to be easy to find new business, you will need to make some hard decisions about how many staff you can keep on, and for how long. If you need to make staff reductions, do them all in one go, as a long-drawn-out process will be terrible for morale. Dave Costley-Wood, Enterprise Consulting partner at KPMG, says: “If one of your largest customers goes bust, the mantra is, ‘Keep calm and act swiftly.’ \"Replacing the lost sales will be a challenge, but the first priority is to try to get paid for the work you have done. Here, the first 48 hours are critical. \"Are you insured? If so, notify your insurer, follow its instructions and you should get repaid. If not, and you have delivered goods to [the customer], get on site as soon as you can and identify your goods – an administrator has to let you do that, so don’t take no for an answer. If you have them, assert your retention of title rights immediately.” He adds: “Do you hold anything belonging to your customer – for instance, if you are a haulier, do you hold any of [your customer’s] goods? If so, these can often lawfully be held until your debt is paid. Speak to your contact at the company – there may be a sale of the business pending, in which case, negotiate new terms that allow for some repayment. \"Of course, information is key – even 24 hours’ notice can make all the difference. When a high-street fashion chain went bust recently, lorries turned up in advance to remove stock from a rented warehouse. The warehouseman immediately ‘smelt a rat’, shut the facility to protect his unpaid rent, and then was able to negotiate a deal with the administrators.” • Another way to protect your business financially is with the right company car financed in the best way.
