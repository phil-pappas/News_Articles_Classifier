The company announced that the ANZAC frigate systems upgrade project has successfully completed the combat system critical design review on schedule and to New Zealand's satisfaction.\nThe government-mandated review proves a contractor's progress and planning for all elements of a program. It covered in detail all of Lockheed Martin Canada's plans for shipboard systems and designs. With the successful review, Lockheed Martin Canada can begin implementing detailed designs and plans for the system's key components, which will in turn lead to ship installation. The milestone is the latest achievement for Lockheed Martin Canada's ANZAC team in the 16 months since contract award.\nIn April 2014 , following an extensive worldwide competitive tender, Lockheed Martin Canada was selected as the Prime Systems Integrator by the New Zealand Ministry of Defence to upgrade the combat systems on their ANZAC class ships. Lockheed Martin Canada's Combat Management System 330 is the backbone of the technical solution for this project and many of the sub-systems to be supplied by Lockheed Martin Canada are common to the Royal Canadian Navy's Halifax Class Modernization Project.\n\"Our success on this program is a direct result of our collaborative approach to building relationships and demonstrated ability to manage multiple stakeholders through complex projects,\" said Rosemary Chapdelaine , vice president for Lockheed Martin Canada Mission Systems and Training.\nEchoing this sentiment of collaboration, New Zealand Ministry of Defence project director Gary Collier added, \"I continue to be impressed with Lockheed Martin Canada's flexibility, responsiveness and pragmatic approach to achieving a successful outcome for both parties. We are pleased to have Lockheed Martin Canada as the prime contractor and partner for this critical project for New Zealand's Ministry of Defence and the Royal New Zealand Navy.\"\nLockheed Martin Canada's combat management system was also down-selected as one of two solutions qualified to compete for the Royal New Zealand Navy's Maritime Sustainment Capability – the future replenishment tanker - which will maintain afloat replenishment capability for the New Zealand Defence Force.\nRosemary Chapdelaine continued, \"This project has truly placed our products and capability in a global spotlight and positioned us for future international growth, demonstrating our ability to create jobs and economic growth for Canada . ANZAC leverages the expertise and record of success established through Canada's Halifax Class Modernization Project – and now other customers can take full advantage of the modern combat system integration methodology and lessons learned from both of these sophisticated programs.\"\nFor additional information, visit our website: www.lockheedmartin.ca\nAbout Lockheed Martin Canada:\nLockheed Martin Canada, headquartered in Ottawa , is the Canadian-based arm of Lockheed Martin Corporation, a global security and aerospace company.
