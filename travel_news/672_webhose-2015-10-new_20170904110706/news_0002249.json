Then the family's 85-foot Arabian dhow, My Ibra, was restored in 2013 for top-end overnight charters. \nA six-vessel fleet also offers tourists fishing, diving, snorkelling, island-hopping and viewings of historical forts and palaces.

As a woman, she has had to adjust her customs to suit but says this has not hampered her success. \nIt's customary for business to be conducted at late-night dinners - but Ms Zawawi is not invited. Women also typically don't get a handshake. \n\"Maybe initially some people have not taken me seriously but that hasn't lasted,\" Ms Zawawi said. \n\"You get used to not immediately holding out your hand for a handshake - you wait for a male colleague to do that first, just in case he's very traditional and would feel uncomfortable touching you as a woman. \n\"I haven't found that it gets in the way, really, or stops anything. It's not expected for me to bond in that way with male colleagues and that's fine.\" \nMs Zawawi was Oman's 2013 Travelex Tourism Ambassador of the year and also won the Sustainable Tourism Ambassador Award in 2014. \nAnd she has employed illiterate Arabic women living in the village to provide visitors with an authentic tourism experience centred around Omani cuisine and the culture of village life. \nOf her two sons, Cameron, now 30, and 24-year-old Qais, it was the youngest who had to adjust most to Omani life, straight from Lindisfarne Anglican College in the Tweed. \n\"It has been great for him to see how the Arab side of our family lives,\" his mother said. \"All the cousins, and the celebrations of the Islamic holidays...\" Ex Tweed Coast and Fingal Heads resident Clara Zawawi on board her luxary 90 foot Dhow, The \"My Ibra\" enjoying a cruise along the coast of Oman in the Gulf of Oman.Photo: Scott Powick Daily NewsTWE041015business SCOTT POWICK \nQais went to an international school and is now studying at university in The Netherlands. \n\"That wouldn't have happened if we were still in Australia,\" Ms Zawawi said. \n\"So (the move) has internationalised him, which I think is invaluable in this modern world.\" \nSail and Snorkel starts at $140, private charters at $1200, overnight charters $7000 daily. \nSuper-yacht Amara costs $40,000 a day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:10:40.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
