Conceived and seeded by Lufthansa India, the #Diwalisurprise campaign has been rolled-out simultaneously across 80 countries and expects a participation of 1 million Indians worldwide.\nCelebrating the spirit of love and togetherness, the #Diwalisurprise campaign gives participants a chance to unite with their loved ones by registering their “wish” and getting a chance to win tickets for Lufthansa flights.\nThe campaign offers three interesting avenues for users to participate in – Light up a heart where participants can register their wish to win a ticket for themselves and their loved ones; Illuminate a plane where a user’s wish will add light to help create a digital marvel of a Lufthansa 747-8 illuminated in Diwali lights. Once registered, users will be able to see their wishes progressively illuminating the Lufthansa 747-8 on the microsite home page. In addition to illuminating the plane, with the use of interactive and live technology, users will also be able to view the ‘Wish Network,’ a live map where their wishes will light up the countries of the sender and recipient. Finally, the campaign includes a Light up a life dimension in the spirit of Diwali where the users wishes help brighten a child’s life. Every registered wish will help children in need through help alliance projects across India.\nSpeaking on the campaign, Mr. Wolfgang Will, Director, South Asia, Lufthansa Passenger Airlines, said, “The #Diwalisurprise campaign is yet another affirmation of the fact that India is very close to our heart and that as a brand we are ‘More Indian than you think’. Lufthansa has constantly strived to establish a deeper connection with its Indian customers and this time we have gone a step beyond India and reached out to Indians across the globe. We are truly excited to unveil this campaign globally and hope it will be a resounding success.”\nMr. Prasoon Joshi, Chairman McCann Worldgroup, Asia Pacific and CEO &CCO McCann Worldgroup, India, added, “Building on ‘More Indian Than You Think’, the Lufthansa Diwali campaign taps into intrinsic Indian emotion of togetherness. We believe no festival is complete without our loved ones besides us. This is the first of its kind, global digital-only campaign for Lufthansa to be conceived and executed by MRM//McCann India.”\nCommenting on the digital strategy behind the campaign, Sangeeta Sharma, Senior Manager, Marketing and Communications, Lufthansa Passenger Airlines, said, “#Diwalisurprise is a tribute to the spirit of the people of India and to the Festival of Lights. Diwali is India’s biggest festival and perhaps the most unifying one too. Keeping this in mind, we have anchored the entire campaign on digital and mobile platforms to reach out to as many Indians as possible. For the first time, we have extensively used interactive and live technology to make the user experience friendly and exciting.”\nLufthansa has partnered with Help Alliance to support children in need through this campaign. Wishes submitted during the campaign will help children in need through help alliance projects in India, including Sunshine Project in Delhi, BREADS in Bengaluru, Child Sponsoring Circle in Khandwa and Prana Project in Pondicherry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:37:18.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
