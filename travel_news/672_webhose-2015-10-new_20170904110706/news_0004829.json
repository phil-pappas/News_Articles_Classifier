Credit: PA There could soon be more female pilots working for Luton -based airline easyJet.\nThat's because the company's launched an initiative to double the proportion of women who fly for them to around 12%.\nThey say they'll go into schools to attract pilots of the future as well as offering more places to women on their training programme.\n“At easyJet we value diversity and we believe that having a workforce which better reflects our customers will help support our future success.\nWe have made sustained progress in our senior management and M&A (management and administration) communities in recent years but we recognise that the proportion of our pilots who are female is too low, as it is across the industry as a whole.\nA career as a pilot is interesting and rewarding and we want more women to bring their skills to the role.\nOur initial focus will be to increase the pipeline of female pilots, including by talking to young women who may not have considered it as a career.\nThis is a long term strategy, which we hope will eventually lead to easyJet recruiting, retaining and developing many more female pilots.”\n– Brian Tyrrell, head of flight operations at easyJet To find out more about the scheme, click here\nLast updated Thu 15 Oct 2015 Travel Luton Bedfordshire", "external_links": ["http://mediacentre.easyjet.com/stories/9507"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:22:02.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
