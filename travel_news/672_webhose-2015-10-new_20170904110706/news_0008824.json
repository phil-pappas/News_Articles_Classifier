However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy .\nSingapore (CNN) With up and coming hipster hoods popping up around the city, Singapore's veteran creative hub Arab Street continues to thrive, morphing into a calmer and cooler version of its once young and overly energetic self.\nIn addition to new trendy hangouts, Arab Street celebrates its colorful heritage.\nRather than just one road, Arab Street actually refers to the area including Bussorah Street, Haji and Bali Lanes and Muscat Street.\nPart of the culturally rich Kampong Glam heritage trial, Arab Street -- surrounded by brightly colored fabrics and textiles, hand-knotted Persian rugs and aromatic Arab teas -- is Singapore's Muslim quarter.\nIts heart is the Masjid Sultan Mosque, with a history that reaches back 200 years.\nRead More But this is also an area of indie boutiques, restored shop-houses and street arts (not a common sight in Singapore) -- that attract anyone from buskers to tourists to families.\nThis is our pick of what not to miss.\nKampong Glam Cafe\nA place to show off your knowledge of local hot spots. Serving local Kampung food since 2004, this place should be on everyone's hit list.\nSpecializing in Singaporean, Indonesian and Malay food, anything diners choose from this old-school establishment's extensive and eclectic menu will leave them wanting more -- and perhaps a few extra glasses of water depending on how spicy they go.\nDinner and drinks for two costs less than $20 Singapore dollars (about U.S. $14).\nHighly recommended is the Mee Siam (thin rice noodles in a mix of spicy, sweet and sour gravy) or Mee Bandung (delicious noodle soup with eggs and an array of chilies, onions, spice and shrimp paste).\nKampong Glam Cafe , 22 Baghdad Street, Singapore Singapore; Open 8 a.m.-2 a.m. daily\nMasjid Sultan Mosque\nSingapore's \"national mosque,\" not just for the Muslim community. Masjid Sultan Mosque is a special place for not only the Muslim community, but for Singapore itself.\nIt began life in the early 1800s , when Sultan Hussain Shah, Ruler of Temasek (the former name of Singapore) proposed to build a mosque.\nThese days it's considered the \"national mosque\" of Singapore.\nThe original Masjid Sultan Mosque was demolished after about a century to make way for the current building, which was completed in 1932.\nThis however doesn't take anything away from the attention it commands.\nWith its golden dome a majestic icon of the area, this place of worship is definitely worth a visit, no matter what one's religious beliefs.\nConservative dress is recommended but they have shawls for visitors who require them.\nSultan Mosque , 3 Muscat St, Singapore 198833 Singapore;\nThe Projector\nThe Projector aims at showcasing works from non-mainsteam talents. More than 40 years old, The Projector describes itself as \"not your average cinema.\"\nIndependently run by a dedicated team of volunteers, The Projector is that alternative movie experience that's admittedly hard to find in Singapore.\nFeaturing both local and international films and events, the diversity of what's on offer here is far from conventional.\nThis is very definitely a snapshot of your \"rough around the edges\" Singapore.\nVisit for information of their latest events and screening times.\nThe Projector , 6001 Beach Rd, Singapore 199589 Singapore; Mon-Fri, 6:30-11:30 p.m., Sat-Sun, 1-11:30 p.m.\nCraft Assembly\nIndie boutiques and vintage stores like Craft Assembly dot throughout this area. Very shiok!\nThat Malay/Singaporean term for experiencing sheer pleasure is the first description that comes to mind when walking over the threshold of this very-cool-without-trying vintage store.\nFilled with tote bags, dresses and one off jewelry pieces, this concept store commissions designers to display their work.\nThis means that they can focus on crafting one-off pieces and the store can concentrate on marketing their products.\nEverything is hand-made and customers should be prepared to spend some time and money in this store.\nCraft Assembly , 61 Haji Lane, Singapore;\nSoon Lee\nThe shop stocks one-off item from local and international designers. Unashamedly feminine, Soon Lee is not a typical fashion store.\nIt's filled with pieces of clothing, books, and bags from both local and international designers.\nAnd the jewelry? As dainty as the store itself.\nSingaporean owned and inspired, the mix of styles including corporate, casual and fun means shoppers will always find something their wardrobe is lacking.\nCustomers do have to physically visit the store -- its owners are going against the grain and not having online sales -- just a presence on Instagram and Facebook.\nSoon Lee , 73 Haji Lane, Singapore;\nTrippies / Children Little Museum\nTrippies is Singapore of decades ago. A definite blast from the past, the shop Trippies (formerly known as Grandfather's Collections) and the Children Little Museum on Bussorah Street, offer a nostalgic look back at life as a young person in Singapore in the 1960s and 70s.\nPatrick Neo, now a retired professional photographer, personally amassed everything on display at the museum -- or for sale in his shop -- starting in his childhood.\nThere are no iPhones and iPads here.\nVisitors are more likely to stumble upon something like Chapteh, or hacky sack with a shuttlecock, played by uncles and aunties (Singaporeans affectionate name for their older generation) in their youth.\nThe shop's tin-man robot stands tall and proud at the front door, waiting for sightseers to step in, and back in time.\nChildren Little Museum , 42 Bussorah St, Singapore 199460 Singapore; +65 6298 2713; Open daily 10:30 a.m.-10 p.m.\nTrippies' opening hours from 11:30 a.m.-9 p.m.\nWorking Title\nIce-cream cookies are a must-try. Sitting beneath a travelers lodge, this cafe 's name might be random but it's worth making a special effort to get to this place.\nIt's known for its pastas and craft beers, and is made up of a diverse collection of indoor and outdoor area furniture.\nWorking Title is the perfect place for a first date or a lazy afternoon with friends.\nTried and trusted offerings include the oversized ice-cream cookies, and the English Earl -- a light refreshing tea flavored ice cream that's full of flavor.\nBonus: happy Hour is every hour, which means cheap drinks all the time.\nWorking Title , 48 Arab Street, Singapore 199745 Singapore; Mon-Thu, 11 a.m.-10 p.m., Fri, 11 a.m.-11 p.m., Sat-Sun., 10 a.m.-11 p.m.\nBluJaz Cafe\nThree floors with three different vibes -- which you pick depends on the occasion and your mood. As the name suggests, BluJaz Cafe hosts soulful live jazz music three times a week, wafting through its three-story shop house and courtyard.\nBands play every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights. The atmosphere is casual and the hours go by within the blink of an eye.\nInsider tip -- be sure to select your seat carefully as each area has a different feel.\nThe courtyard outside has a buzzy vibe with patrons sitting around massive wooden tables eating, drinking and letting the music drift around them.\nInside on the first floor is for front row seats to the band, with the upper level the bar and dance floor.\nIt's the highlight of any trip to the area during the evening -- and one of the very few places that still has shisha on offer, to compliment its simple and tasteful Mediterranean menu.\nBlu Jaz , 11 Bali Lane, Singapore 189848 Singapore; +65 6292 3800; Mon-Thu, noon-midnight, Fri, noon-2 a.m., Sat, 4 p.m.-2 a.m.", "external_links":
