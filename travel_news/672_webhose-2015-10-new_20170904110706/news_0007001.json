However, after noticing the reduction in the number of tourists from the US, Prime Minister Stephen Harper allocated a budget of CAD29.2 million (US$30 million) in order to boost tourism promotion in the US. Moreover, the weak Canadian currency has impacted the outbound tourism of the country.\nKey Findings\n• Canada’s tourism sector flourished during the historic period (2009-2014). Domestic tourist volumes expanded at a CAGR of 4.02%. International arrivals increased at an average annual growth of 1.62% to 2014, while total inbound tourist expenditure recorded a growth of 3.88%. The reason for slow growth in the arrivals was mainly because of a cut in the tourism budget, which has resulted in a decline of almost 4 million American tourists since 2001. In order to attract tourists back from the US, Canada launched a three year program called “Connecting America” in 2015. On the other side, the US, Canada’s key source market has been promoting tourism aggressively in Canada. Outbound trips to the US are projected to reach 25.5 million by 2019 while the overall outbound trips are expected to reach 37.2 million in the same year. Moreover, with the falling Canadian dollar, the international arrivals are projected to reach 18.7 million by 2019\n• In 2015, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced a budget of CAD29.2 million (US$30 million) for three years in order to boost tourism promotion in the US. Moreover, as per the federal budget, under the three year program called “Connecting America”, Tourism Industry Association of Canada (TIAC) will be focusing on attracting the U.S. citizens to Canada in order to bring back those 4 million American tourists that the country has lost since 2001. Under this budget, the plan is to enhance the tourist’s experience by investing in public transit, cultural centers and historic sites on Canada's 150th birthday celebrations in 2017\n• The number of tourists from China to Canada has increased by more than 30% during the first two months of 2015. The weakening of the Canadian dollar against the Chinese yuan was one of the major reasons that supported this growth. Moreover, by the end of this year, following the increase in the numbers of the tourists, the Chinese flight carrier, Air China is set to launch its direct nonstop flights between Beijing and Montreal\nAVAIL SAMPLE REPORT @ Recent Published News on Travel and Tourism in Canada 2019\nSynopsis\nCanadean’s report — Travel and Tourism in Canada to 2019 — provides detailed information on the country’s tourism sector, analyzing market data and providing insights.
