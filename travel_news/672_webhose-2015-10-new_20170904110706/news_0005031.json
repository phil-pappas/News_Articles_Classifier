The last few weeks — the recess and conference season — have given them enough good, strong political material to work on. First, tax credits . The revolt is on within the Tory Party. Whether on the thinking wing (David Willetts) or the self-interested one (Boris), there's a drumbeat of concern. So far the responses from Cameron and Osborne have been resolute. They have no plans to back down . It's the right thing. And besides, average families will be better off. Note that those are two quite separate arguments. On the one hand the government are saying that the tax credit cuts are right. In effect, they are being done on principle — and, logically, it should not matter whether they hurt real families or not. That shouldn't be the point. They are either right or wrong, and if the latter should be down whatever the cost. \"The Tories think the Labour Party are in la-la-land. Time to show them just how wrong they are\" On the other hand there is the argument that losses from tax credits are more than compensated by other government actions. That is a concession that winners and losers matter, and that precise amounts count. It is a pragmatic argument. This gives some obvious openings to Labour. The hardest question in politics is \"Why?\" Many politicians have the talking points that explain exactly how brilliant a particular reform is — but those take for granted that a reform is good. Fewer by far can argue a case for change from first principles. Labour should keep asking \"Why?\" That should generate two answers. One, that the changes are \"right\", opens up the accusation of heartlessness. The other, that the money is needed, opens up the question of values and priorities; why hit these particular people? From this — forcing the government to explain why they are making the cuts — all other things flow. Labour should mock the idea of delaying until after Christmas the letters setting out the cuts for individual households. Injustice delayed is not injustice denied. Then, the Tory figures on why households are better off should be forensically scrutinised. In them are assumptions that workers facing cuts in income will work more hours. A figure has been calculated for the cash benefit of free child care; not all can or will take that up. And so on. The figures are dodgy because a rise in the Living Wage cannot arithmetically buy out a tax credit cut. As all thinking politicians since Sir Keith Joseph have known, wages don't tackle poverty; governments do with benefits. \"At the same time, Labour should shut up about 'privatisation' of the NHS. It's not actually happening\" And Labour should focus group to death the language they use. This is an argument to be won with the public. It doesn't matter what language pleases a Labour audience — they are people who oppose the cuts already. The centre ground have to be won over and it is far less likely that an outraged comparison of a cut in tax credits with a cut in inheritance tax will do the business. The strongest argument is the simplest: why punish people who are doing the right thing and going out to work for their family? Second, health. The government delayed the first quarter figures on how hospital trusts are doing financially until the third quarter was underway. Of course there will be suspicion that concealing a £930m deficit until after the Tory conference was the result of political interference. That doesn't matter; it's pure processology. The issue is the deficits themselves. The focus has to be on them and their causes. So far the government have got away with sacking chief executives and hoping that the bureaucrats can be blamed. That has a limit, which has almost be reached. Time for Labour to go back to the election and Quote: the words of Cameron back to him. He promised extra cash to the NHS: time to accelerate it. There's an Autumn Statement coming: demand that it's used. And have a kick at the Seven Day NHS on the way through . When a service is racking up deficits of nearly a billion pounds in the first three months of the financial year, why on earth add new demands for at least £1.5bn spend? But at the same time, Labour should shut up about \"privatisation\" of the NHS. It's not actually happening, which is why the health service scare campaign in the General Election failed. Focus on the facts as they are — they're bad enough. And if the argument is to be widened, make it about competence. That's the prize — a government who are seen as just not up to it. This is what Labour should get down to now that Parliament is back. The model of necessary opposition is that it should be forensic, focused and focus grouped. The Tories won't be expecting it. They think the Labour Party are in la-la-land. Time to show them just how wrong they are. telepolitics Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:18:12.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
