(CNN) They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but its size and makeup varies enormously around the world. Over in Norway, you may be tucking into a slice of Norvegia cheese on toasted bread , while in Lebanon you might opt for creamy fatteh -- a dip made with chickpeas, yogurt and pine nuts. And that doesn't even cover lunch or dinner. With those, you've got a whole other host of opportunities. Culinary Journeys wants to see what a typical breakfast, lunch and dinner consists of where you are in the world.
