WVO has five timeshare resorts, a corporate office and more than 1,700 associates with positions across consumer finance, sales and marketing, and hospitality operations in Las Vegas.\n“It’s an honor to once again be recognized among the best places to work in Southern Nevada,” said Sarah King, executive vice president of human resources for WVO. “We aspire to be an employer of choice in the markets we serve, and we’re committed to providing our associates with a rewarding work environment. In addition, our associates are extremely passionate about giving back to their local communities, and I am very proud of our Las Vegas associates for continuing to make a positive difference in the lives of others each and every year.”\nIn addition to offering a robust variety of development programs, associates are encouraged to lead a healthy and balanced lifestyle, supported by the company’s Be Well program. In 2014, the Las Vegas campus added a one-mile walking path, and associates once again participated in the City of Las Vegas Corporate Challenge, which provides a healthy way for local companies and their employees to stay active in the community.\nLast year, Las Vegas associates contributed more than $130,000 in monetary and in-kind donations benefiting several charities, including the Goodie Two Shoes Foundation and Cure 4 the Kids, as well as The Painted Turtle summer camp, a part of WVO’s signature charity, SeriousFun Children’s Network. During the holiday season, the company partnered with the Goodie Two Shoes Foundation to provide new shoes to more than 400 children with financial hardship at a local elementary. Associates also delivered gifts to nearly 1,000 children at the same elementary school.\nAs the world’s largest vacation ownership company, WVO provides a wide-range of benefits including medical/dental/vision coverage, travel discounts, matching 401k, as well as work-life balance options, and educational assistance, including tuition reimbursement for higher education degree credit courses and certificate programs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:48:44.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
