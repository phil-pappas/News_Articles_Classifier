The scent of baking apples wafting from the kitchen, particularly when the apples are fresh-picked from the orchard on a crisp blue-skied afternoon. Even without a neighborhood orchard at your disposal, local markets are brimming with every variety come October: the Empire (firm and great for cooking), McIntosh (softer and ideal for apple sauce), Fuji (large and crisp, perfect for eating raw). The only difficulty is figuring out the most delicious way to eat them. And these three recipes, from three of our favorite chefs, are not only tasty, but healthy to boot.\nBritish sister duo and authors Melissa Hemsley and Jasmine Hemsley are sharing a tart that is free from gluten, grain, and refined sugar but still delivers serious autumnal flavor. Ella Woodward—who focuses on a strict plant-based diet—offers a baked apple recipe that’s good for the stomach and the soul. And Sarah Britton, a holistic nutritionist and certified nutritional practitioner, shares an unconventional take on the fruit: sorbet.\nFrench Apple Tart By Melissa Hemsley and Jasmine Hemsley\nIngredients:\n3 T coconut flour\n175 grams ground almonds\n1 pinch of sea salt\n55 grams butter, room temperature\n1 T maple syrup\n2 egg whites, beaten\n4-5 apples, cored and thinly sliced\nSome melted butter, raw honey, and cinnamon to top\nInstructions:\n1. Sieve the coconut flour into a mixing bowl. Add the ground almonds and salt and mix. Cut the butter into small cubes and add to the bowl. Using a knife, cut the butter into the dry mix. Go on doing this until it looks fairly even, and then begin to rub the butter into the dry mix using only your fingertips with a light touch. Once all the butter is mixed in, there should be no lumps in the dry mix. Add the maple syrup to the beaten egg whites and fold in with a wooden spoon.\n2. Knead the mixture together to form dough, mopping up any remaining dry mix as you go. You can now roll out the dough straightaway, or you can allow it to cool in the fridge, making it easier to work with.\n3. Take the tart dish and cut out the baking parchment slightly larger than the size of the dish. Place your pastry in the center of the baking paper and roll out very gently until it covers the area required for the dish—around 4-5 millimeters thick. Note: It may crack, and if it does, push the pastry back together. Gently lift the baking parchment with the rolled-out pastry onto the tart dish.\n4. Arrange the apple slices in a concentric circle. Brush all around with melted butter and sprinkle cinnamon over to taste.\n5. Place into the oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 35-40 minutes, or until lightly browned. Allow to cool from the oven, and then brush with a mixture of honey or maple syrup and lemon juice to glaze.\nServe with organic crème fraîche or homemade custard.\nBaked Apples With Coconut Cream By Ella Woodward\nIngredients:\nApples\n4 red apples (Braeburn apples work well)\n2/3 cup raisins\n2 tsp. ground cinnamon\n2 handfuls of pecans\n5 T coconut palm sugar\nInstructions:\n1. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius (fan 180 degrees Celsius)\n2. Use an apple corer to take the core out of the apples so that there is a hole from top to bottom. If you don’t have an apple corer, then cut around the core with a knife and scoop out the core with a spoon. Mix the raisins, cinnamon, pecans, and coconut sugar together. Place the apples on a baking tray and stuff the core with the raisin mix. Then sprinkle all of the leftover mix around the apples. Drizzle 6 tablespoons of water over the leftovers around the apples.\n3. Place the apples into the oven and allow them to bake for 30 minutes, until they’re totally soft. Put each apple in a bowl to serve with a scoop of the raisin mix from the tray, and then pour the coconut cream over everything.\nCoconut cream\n100 grams coconut cream\n3 T date or maple syrup\n2 T coconut palm sugar\n2 T almond butter\nJust before the apples finish cooking, make the coconut cream. Put the coconut cream in a blender with 10 tablespoons boiling water and all the other ingredients and blend until smooth.\nApple Spice Sorbet By Sarah Britton\nIngredients:\n4-5 cups chopped apples\nknob of coconut oil or ghee\n1 T ground cinnamon\n1/2 tsp. ground cardamom\n1 tsp. ground ginger\n1/2 tsp. ground star anise\n1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg\n1/4 cup maple syrup, divided\n1/4 tsp. sea salt\n1 whole vanilla bean, seeds scraped\n2 cans full-fat coconut milk\n1/2 cup hazelnuts, roasted and chopped (optional)\nMaple syrup to drizzle, if desired\nBlender\nIce cream maker\nInstructions:\n1. Chop apples into bite-sized chunks.\n2. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt a knob of coconut oil or ghee. Add chopped apples, all spices, and the vanilla bean, including the empty pod. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the maple syrup. Stir to coat and cook for 10 minutes or so, until the apples are soft. Let cool slightly.\n3. In a blender, place the cooked apples (remove vanilla pod first), remaining 2 tablespoons maple syrup, and coconut milk. Blend on high until smooth. Taste for sweetness, add more maple syrup if desired.\n4. Pour contents of blender into an ice cream maker and process according to the manufacturer’s instructions. When complete, fold in roasted hazelnuts. Cover sorbet with plastic wrap and place in the freezer to harden completely.\n5. Remove sorbet at least 15 minutes before serving to soften. Serve with extra maple syrup, if desired.\nFrench Apple Tart courtesy of Melissa Hemsley and Jasmine Hemsley, Hemsley + Hemsley ( hemsleyandhemsley.com ); Baked Apples with Coconut Cream courtesy of Ella Woodward, excerpted from Deliciously Ella: 100+ Easy, Healthy, and Delicious Plant-Based, Gluten-Free Recipes ; Apple Spice Sorbet courtesy of Sarah Britton, My New Roots ( mynewroots.org ) and cookbook My New Roots: Inspired Plant-Based Recipes for Every Season", "external_links": ["http://www.hemsleyandhemsley.com/recipe/french-apple-tart/", "http://www.mynewroots.org/site/2013/10/apple-spice-sorbet/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/147679328X"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:17:21.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
