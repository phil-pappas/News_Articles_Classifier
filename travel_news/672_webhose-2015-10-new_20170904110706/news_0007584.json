Leveraging the performance and cost advantages of the automotive-qualified technology, automakers can easily deploy advanced infotainment and driver assistance features, such as surround-view parking, lane-departure warning and collision avoidance systems, across a broader range of vehicles. Visit www.opensig.org for more information.\nA growing number of the world's leading car makers have adopted one-pair automotive Ethernet technology as their connectivity solution of choice in a vast range of vehicles, including the BMW X3, X4, X5, X6, i3, i8, 6 Series and 7 Series vehicles; the Jaguar XJ and XF; and the Volkswagen Passat.\n\"There is no doubt that consumer demand for advanced driver assistance and infotainment features are on the rise,\" said Dr. Kirsten Matheus , Ethernet Project Manager at BMW. \"One pair automotive Ethernet technology provides a single, centralized network backbone that simplifies the deployment of advanced features.\"\n\"In the past, automakers relied on a variety of connectivity solutions in each of the isolated domains inside the vehicle,\" said Dr. Ali Abaye , Senior Director of Automotive at Broadcom. \"BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet technology enables automakers to introduce luxury-model safety and infotainment features throughout the fleet, including mid-range and economy class vehicles.\"\n\"Since the formation of the OPEN Alliance, interest in one pair automotive Ethernet technology has risen at a dramatic pace. Today, membership in the SIG stands at nearly 300 auto and tech companies, representing a 36X increase in just four years,\" said Natalie A. Wienckowski , Strategy Lead, Core Hardware Team at General Motors and Chair for the OPEN Alliance SIG . \"As the automotive industry accelerates adoption of Ethernet based networks, the implementation support provided by OPEN is invaluable to its members.\"\n\"Standards-based solutions such as BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet not only reduce time-to-market, they also ensure availability, lifecycle, upgradability and interoperability,\" said Ian Riches , Director, Global Automotive Practice, Strategy Analytics. \"Now that a secure system backbone is in place, connected car development is kicking into high gear. We're predicting up to one-half billion Ethernet ports to be deployed in cars by 2020.\"\nAvailability\nIn addition to Broadcom Corporation , several major semiconductor suppliers have licensed or incorporated the technology into their portfolio of automotive chips and modules, including Freescale and NXP . Broadcom , NXP and Realtek will present a joint demonstration at the IEEE Ethernet & IP @ Automotive Tech Day, October 27 – 28, 2015 in Yokohama, Japan .\nAbout the Technology\nThe Open Alliance automotive Ethernet standard delivers high-performance bandwidth of 100 megabits per second (Mbps) per port while dramatically reducing connectivity costs and cabling weight. The fully automotive-qualified technology integrates specialized, separate systems into a centralized, secure platform, allowing multiple end points to simultaneously access and communicate information with a single protocol for data transfer.\nThe OPEN Alliance has worked closely with IEEE in order to drive further innovation and standardization. The specification of a BroadR-Reach compliant IEEE standard is about to be finalized as IEEE 100BASE-T1 . The release of a next generation IEEE 1000BASE-T1 technology is expected in early 2016.\nAbout the OPEN Alliance SIG\nThe OPEN Alliance (One-Pair Ether-Net) Special Interest Group (SIG) is a non-profit, open industry alliance of mainly automotive industry and technology providers collaborating to encourage wide scale adoption of Ethernet-based networks as the standard in automotive networking applications. Since its inception, the OPEN Alliance SIG has surged to nearly 300 members strong.
