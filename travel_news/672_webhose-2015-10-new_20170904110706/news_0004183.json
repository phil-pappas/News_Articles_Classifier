Sure, why not?\nAnd for those buying a Local Epic Pass this season to hit Breckenridge, Keystone, Vail and others, well, Vail Resorts is bigger than ever — which might warrant a trip to Utah this winter.\nGranted, Vail — whose home mountain has long been the largest ski resort in the United States at 5,289 skiable acres — is no longer the biggest. Parent company Vail Resorts has connected (and then rebranded) its two Utah resorts, Park City and The Canyons , which it combined into one mega-resort with 7,300 acres of skiable terrain. The new name for the combined resorts is simply Park City, and it's included in the Local Epic Pass . Advertisement\nPark City is best known for the wide groomers on its front mountains. With the addition of The Canyons, the resort gains legendary expert-onlyg terrain. The two resorts are linked by the 8,015-foot-long Quicksilver Gondola to form the mega resort.\nThe new Park City will span 6.5 miles, with 38 lifts servicing 34,400 feet of vertical on 17 mountains and 14 bowls.\nBefore you book those plane tickets to Salt Lake City (just sayin': You can easily fly into Salt Lake in the morning and ski Park City, which is just 30 minutes from the airport, in the afternoon), check out the blackout dates on your Epic Passes. Those dates usually cover all of the winter holidays, depending on which pass you chose.\nVail Resorts is going big in other ways this winter. The company will spend up to $115 million in improvements at its nine mountains and two urban resorts this season . The $50 million project at Park City (which will link the two resorts) is one of the most ambitious capital programs in U.S. ski industry history.\n\"We're not operating under the idea that bigger is better,\" said Kirsten Lynch of Vail Resorts. \"We're continually looking for ways to make things better so that we can provide the experience of a lifetime for the people who come to our resorts. And we're spending a significant amount of money to do so.\"\nColorado has always been competitive with Utah, mostly about the amount of snow we get. Utah does get some fine powder. In fact there have been years when the storms coming from the west dump there first. But over the span of the season, snow totals tend to even out: for example, Vail averages 245 inches, while Canyons typically gets 255.\nAnd then, travelers, there are the resorts even farther afield. Epic Pass holders also have unrestricted access to Mt. Brighton in Michigan and Afton Alps in Minnesota, plus Vail's California resorts, Heavenly, Northstar and Kirkwood.\nOr maybe think even bigger, if you're already planning to hop on a plane to ski or ride. The Epic Pass includes access to Verbier, in Switzerland, via an international partnership. And for holders of the Rocky Mountain Super Pass, hey, you can even head to Japan to ski at Nekoma, Tomamu or Alts Bandai. Or to New Zealand to ski Cardrona Alpine Resort.\nSo, pass holders, this season consider going to check out other resorts — and then come home to enjoy your home mountains all the more.", "external_links": ["http://www.snow.com/epic-pass/passes/epic-local-pass.aspx", "http://www.skicolorado.com/MultiMountain_SeasonPasses.html", "http://www.snow.com/epic-pass/passes/epic-pass.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:06:43.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
