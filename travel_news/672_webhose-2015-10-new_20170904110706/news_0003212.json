Referring to the rape of a two-and-half-year-old infant, she said, \"In last seven days, this is third such case. I don't get this, what is going on in Delhi, what sort of ghastly people are these? I have met the victim she has been bitten all over her body, and she was left porously bleeding in the park.\" \"There are huge shortcomings in the law and order situation of the capital. All the agencies of the Centre and the Delhi Government as well should find a solution to it,\" she added. When asked about Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal blaming the Delhi Police and the Centre for these crimes, Maliwal said she wouldn't like to engage in verbal volleys. \"I am into a coordination agency (DCW), I know what is happening is not right and needs to be corrected, I will reach out wherever I can against such crimes. We do not want another Nirbhaya in Delhi,\" she added. A week after the horrific rape and torture of a four-year-old girl in Delhi, two more cases of minor girls being gang-raped have been reported from the capital. Both the girls have suffered severe injuries and are recovering in hospital. No arrests have been made in the case so far.
