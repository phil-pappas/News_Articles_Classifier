Mahathir Mohamad, his one-time mentor and the country’s former leader, joined other leading figures to call for an investigation into a debt-ridden state investment fund and condemn a crackdown on critical voices . Mr Mahathir, who is Mr Najib’s strongest critic, said the country he led for 22 years has “become a pariah state, where anyone can be hauled up and questioned by the police, detained and charged through abusing laws”. He has repeatedly called on Mr Najib to resign but he was joined at a news conference on Monday by other leading figures in the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), including sacked deputy prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin. Mr Yassin was ousted in July in a Cabinet reshuffle by Mr Najib as he tried to silence his critics. But the controversy engulfing the prime minister has only deepened amid persistent questions about a payment of nearly $700 million (£457 million) into his personal bank account . The country’s royal sultans, who have a largely ceremonial role, last week called for a rapid and transparent investigation into 1MDB, the state fund that has wracked up debts of $11 million. Mr Najib established then fund and chairs its advisory board.

Mr Najib has also been dogged by questions about his own finances after financial investigators found that nearly $700 million had been paid into his personal bank account. The prime minister’s aides have insisted that the payments were contributions made by an unnamed Middle East donor for political purposes. Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing or receiving any personal financial benefit. As his party foes went public with their criticisms, a whistle-blowing former senior member of UMNO, Khairuddin Hassan, and his lawyer, Matthias Chang, were formally charged on Monday with attempts to sabotage Malaysia's banking and financial systems. Mr Khairuddin had called for international law-enforcement authorities to probe the 1MDB scandal. Mr Mahathir and the other UMNO leaders called for the two to be released. \"We see a climate of fear among the people,\" he said. \"The government is now defining the law according to their own needs. We are here to show that we are against the abuse of the law on our country.\" In a further sign of the confusion swirling through the country’s ruling circles, the attorney-general declined to follow recommendation by the central bank to begin criminal proceedings against 1MDB for allegedly breaking foreign exchange rules. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:24:23.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
