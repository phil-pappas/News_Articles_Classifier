These finalists undergo head-to-head comparison testing and evaluation by KBB.com's expert editorial team, and ultimately the winners in each category and an overall winner will be announced in November.\nThe Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Awards is a premier awards program designed to provide a significant service to American new-car buyers by identifying the cream of the crop of all available 2016 model-year vehicles. The finalist models are chosen on a set of criteria that identify overall vehicle quality and value, based both on proprietary Kelley Blue Book metrics and the expert evaluations of the KBB.com editorial staff. The awards are the culmination of a year-long regimen of expert vehicle evaluation and testing of nearly every new vehicle available in America, along with analysis of a broad swath of vehicle-related data, including vehicle pricing/transaction prices, 5-Year Cost-to-Own data (which includes depreciation, insurance, maintenance, financing, fuel, fees and taxes for new cars), consumer reviews and ratings, and vehicle sales/retail sales information.\n\"At Kelley Blue Book, everything we do is designed to help car shoppers make smart decisions, and the Best Buy Awards program is the culmination of a wide variety of data and expert vehicle evaluation efforts throughout the company,\" said Jack R. Nerad , executive editorial director and executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com. \"While at the conclusion of the testing and evaluation period only 12 prestigious models will be deemed 2016 winners, it is a very high honor for a vehicle to be chosen as a finalist for these prominent awards. The automakers represented among this year's finalists offer car buyers with top-notch vehicle choices.\"\nOf more than 300 new-car models available for 2016, Kelley Blue Book's expert editors have narrowed the field to a total of 49 Best Buy Award Finalists that include 18 vehicle makes across 12 major vehicle categories. At the conclusion of the test-evaluation regimen, winners will be named a Kelley Blue Book Best Buy in each of the 12 categories, along with an overall Best Buy of 2016 winner.\n2016 Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award Finalists\nSmall Car\n2016 Honda Civic\n2016 Hyundai Elantra\n2016 Scion iM\n2016 Subaru Impreza\n2016 Toyota Corolla\nMidsize Car\n2016 Chevrolet Malibu\n2016 Honda Accord\n2016 Hyundai Sonata\n2016 Kia Optima\n2016 Mazda MAZDA6\n2016 Toyota Camry\nFull-Size Car\n2016 Chevrolet Impala\n2016 Chrysler 300\n2016 Hyundai Genesis\n2016 Nissan Maxima\n2016 Toyota Avalon\nSmall SUV\n2016 Honda CR-V\n2016 Honda HR-V\n2016 Hyundai Tucson\n2016 Mazda CX-3\nMidsize SUV\n2016 Ford Explorer\n2016 Honda Pilot\n2016 Mitsubishi Outlander\n2016 Toyota Highlander\nFull-Size SUV\n2016 Chevrolet Tahoe\n2016 Ford Expedition\n2016 Toyota Sequoia\nMinivan\n2016 Honda Odyssey\n2016 Kia Sedona\n2016 Toyota Sienna\nPickup Truck\n2016 Chevrolet Colorado\n2016 Ford F-150\n2016 Nissan Titan\n2016 Toyota Tacoma\nPerformance Car\n2016 Chevrolet Camaro\n2016 Chevrolet Corvette\n2016 Ford GT350\n2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata\n2016 Scion FR-S\nElectric/Hybrid Car\n2016 Chevrolet Volt\n2016 Toyota Mirai\n2016 Volkswagen e-Golf\nLuxury Car\n2016 Acura ILX\n2016 Lexus GS\n2016 Mercedes-Benz C-Class\nLuxury SUV\n2016 Acura MDX\n2016 Lexus RX\n2016 Lincoln MKX\n2016 Volvo XC90\n about the 2016 Kelley Blue Book Best Buy Award Finalists, please visit http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/2016-best-buy-awards-nominees/2000012520/ .\nTo discuss this topic, or any other automotive-related information, with a Kelley Blue Book analyst on-camera via the company's on-site studio, please contact a member of the Public Relations team to book an interview.\n and news from Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com, visit www.kbb.com/media/ , follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/kelleybluebook (or @kelleybluebook), like our page on Facebook at www.facebook.com/kbb , and get updates on Google+ at https://plus.google.com/+kbb .\nAbout Kelley Blue Book ( www.kbb.com )\nFounded in 1926, Kelley Blue Book, The Trusted Resource® , is the only vehicle valuation and information source trusted and relied upon by both consumers and the automotive industry.
