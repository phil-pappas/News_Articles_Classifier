It will enable the more than 3,000 retailers and wholesalers who form part of the 19 business associations making up the Confederation to learn first-hand about the potential that the African continent offers the tourism market and thus evaluate their business and investment possibilities.\nEver since it was founded, INVESTOUR has consolidated its position as an indispensable meeting point at which to showcase the opportunities for tourism cooperation and investment in Africa, in a quest to transform tourism into a dynamising force behind its economy and to favour the region’s sustainable development. The forum is increasingly attracting the endorsement of the country’s most representative business institutions, which are now joined by the CEAV after the agreement signed today.and 10 international (non-African) organisations and companies and 150 African projects .\nFavoured by these positive participation figures, the seventh INVESTOUR Africa – which is due to be staged on 21 January as part of FITUR – will repeat its format of round tables for exchanging knowledge and experiences, plus B2B meetings with personal, pre-scheduled appointments between businesspeople from the African tourism industry and Spanish and international operators and potential partners who are interested in investing in that continent.\nSource:- FITUR", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:39:12.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
