Therefore it is high time that we recognized the contribution of our customers and rewarded them for their loyalty to us. According to industry sources currently there are no loyalty programs that are in operation in the custom car audio and accessories industry and therefore Txrcustomcaraudio.com stands a good chance of winning the trust and vote of its customers. The founder and owner of Txrcustomcaraudio.com further said \"Our loyalty program will be very simple. It will be based on the principle that whoever makes regular purchases will be considered loyal and will be rewarded. The program will run as follows: - With every purchase a user will earn certain reward points based on the value of purchase made - With every subsequent purchase, the user will again earn reward points based on the value of the purchases made. In addition the user will also earn reward points that will be for the loyalty shown by making the subsequent purchase. - In this way for any further purchases the user will keep earning reward points for value of purchases and for the loyalty. - In this way users will keep accumulating reward points and users who have accumulated the most points at the end of a month will be declared as top performers of the month and earn more reward points. This cycle will continue and users will keep collecting points. At end of a quarter users will have the option to redeem their points against any custom car audio or accessory sold by Txrcustomcaraudio.com - Each user will have to register with Txrcustomcaraudio.com in order to avail the benefits of the loyalty program. Txrcustomcaraudio.com is very upbeat with the idea of a loyalty program as it is expected to generate huge interest with their customers and is expected to encourage them to make more purchases from Txrcustomcaraudio.com About TXR Custom Car Audio and Accessories: http://www.txrcustomcaraudio.com Set up in 1975 in Austin TX, TXR Custom Car Audio and Accessories was formerly known as Texas Radio & Wireless.
