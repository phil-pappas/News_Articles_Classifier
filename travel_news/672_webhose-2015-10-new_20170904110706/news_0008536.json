Doug Rogers offers a guide to the best hotels for a ringside seat. The Plaza, Central Park South This glorious 20-storey 1907 French Château-style building was originally a residence for wealthy New Yorkers. Decked out in the gold, marble and crystal opulence of a palace, it soon transitioned into New York’s premier hotel, featured in the Great Gatsby (Fitzgerald was a regular), a dozen movies (most famously Hitchcock’s North by Northwest), and site of Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball in 1966. Its status has diminished somewhat in the last decade, but it’s still impressive. Read the full review: The Plaza, New York • The best hotels in New York Trump International, Upper West Side This 52-storey, 172-room luxury tower on the south-west corner of Central Park opposite the Time Warner Center has the impeccable star-studded Jean Georges restaurant at its base. The imperious chandelier-hung marble lobby is a perfect melding of Manhattan glitz and European grandeur, and the modern, minimalist guest rooms with spectacular Central Park views, are sleek yet surprisingly understated. Read the full review: Trump International, New York The Mark, Upper East Side French designer Jacques Grange brings his bold geometric shapes and splashy colors to proceedings, from the marble-floored lobby with its long, narrow black and white floor stripes, to the curvy pink-lit bar counter. The 100 guest rooms and 40 suites combine elegance with hi-tech gadgetry, while Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s French-American Mark Restaurant & Bar is a happening scene, drawing tycoons, Park Avenue heiresses and staff from nearby galleries and auction houses. Read the full review: The Mark, New York JW Marriot Essex House, Central Park South At the JW Marriot Essex House you have soothing green acres of the Park right in front of you and carriage horses trotting by. This Art Deco icon, its name sentinel on the rooftop, dominates Central Park South. Dating back to 1931, its architectural stylings – ornate gilded doors, rich wood panelling, that vintage rooftop sign – recall the glorious Art Deco era, while all the modern interiors and cutting-edge technology associated with Marriott bring it up to date. Read the full review: JW Marriott Essex House, New York NoMo Soho, Soho A sort of Alice in Manhattan Wonderland aesthetic that we hope never goes away. The conservatory restaurant has a dramatic centrepiece table covered in surreal shaped glass vases; there are lots of hanging plants throughout. The hotel's spacious lower lobby hasn’t lost its influence; the Library Bar is typically buzzing with a visiting DJ spinning nightly. The atrium bar-restaurant draws locals. Read the full review: NoMo Soho, New York The Refinery, Midtown Two years in and this Midtown stunner shows no sign of slowing down. The live music at Winnie’s Jazz Bar in the lobby greets guests most nights. The tools displayed behind the front desk are the first of several nods to the building’s past as a hub for the Garment District’s millinery trade. The restaurant and rooftop bar are well worth a visit. Close to Times Square, and the Empire State Building, as well as fashion-world favourites Bryant Park, Macy's and New York Public Library. Read the full review: The Refinery, New York • The best hotels in New York Mandarin Oriental, Hell's Kitchen Set on floors 35 to 54 of the north tower of the Time Warner Center, with spectacular views of Central Park below, this is the ultimate in modern New York luxury. Décor-wise Asian accents – fresh orchids, exotic purple and gold tones – merge with retro elements such as Art Deco chairs and tiled walls. Sleek restaurant Asiate, with its cityscape views and glittering tree-branch ceiling sculpture, has a sumptuous seasonal menu that usually features lobster and Wagyu beef. Read the full review: Mandarin Oriental, New York View of the Thanksgiving parade from the Mandarin Oriental Herald Square Hotel, Koreatown A block or two from Macy’s and Madison Square Garden this charming 19th-century gem in Midtown is the former headquarters of Life Magazine, and has been a beloved family-run hotel since 1965. From the gilt cherubs carved above the arched entryway, to the framed photos of Life covers in the lobby, you will feel like you’re part of history. In keeping with the period feel, some rooms have metal poster beds, and a recent renovation installed marble tiles in the Queen bedrooms. Read the full review: Herald Square, New York Hotel Standford, Koreatown The décor of this Koreatown standard is no-frills, with a brightly-lit granite lobby and chintzy furniture, but there’s a warmth to the place. Staff are bi-lingual Koreans who treat you like old friends, and the second-floor lounge bar with its wood panelling and couches has a gentleman’s club feel that’s perfect for a home coming cocktail. Korean broth house Gam Mee Ok, off the lobby is a must. You are in the shadow of the Empire State Building, a short walk from Broadway.

The 168 sumptuous rooms, two swanky bars, a vintage fireplace and a three-Michelin-star restaurant overseen by Chef Humm and restaurateur Will Guidara. There are multiple locations in the hotel to sample the food and beverage programme or sample the dark and decadent cocktail emporium Elephant Bar, with its 24ft-long mahogany counter.
