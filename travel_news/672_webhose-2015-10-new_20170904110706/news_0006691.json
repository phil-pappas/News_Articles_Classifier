How about catching a train at “magic station”? Or maybe you went shopping along the capital’s “tall, rich and handsome street”? For those not familiar with their Chinese names, that would be The Shard, King’s Cross St Pancras and Savile Row. VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, this year had a 10-week campaign that invited Chinese to give Mandarin names to 101 British destinations and landmarks and to vote on their favourites. Chinese tourists are among the biggest spenders in Britain, shelling out £2,688 each, four times the average VisitBritain The website for the Great Names for Great Britain campaign attracted two million views and 13,000 suggestions. “We want the Chinese public to feel that the destinations are welcoming,” said Robin Johnson, head of overseas operations at VisitBritain. Attractions were being encouraged to include the names in their marketing material for Chinese travellers, he said, adding: “This will help destinations to raise awareness in China and in turn legitimise some of the Chinese names in the long run.” The £1.6 million campaign, which reached an estimated 300 million people, was part of a series of initiatives launched this year to attract more Chinese tourists to Britain. Chinese tourists are among the biggest spenders in Britain, shelling out £2,688 each, four times the average, according to VisitBritain. They also stay longer, 10 nights compared with six across all inbound visits. Statistics from Global Blue, which collects data on tax-free shopping, showed Chinese spending between January and July increased by four per cent year-on-year, while the number of Chinese tourists over the same period rose two per cent. Companies involved in the country’s retail, culture and entertainment sectors would like to see this increase further and in October the UK-China Visa Alliance called on the government to make 10-year visas available to Chinese visitors and to drop the application fee from £737 to £135. The alliance, which is made up of businesses such as the McArthurGlen Group, New West End Co, Walpole, London First and Worldpay, estimated the move would annually bring 265,000 additional Chinese to Britain. The visa process has already seen progress this year. In June, Britain and Belgium set up a pilot scheme to streamline the application process for visitors to the two countries and those in the Schengen area. “Britain needs to present a one-stop shop for Chinese visitors who want both a Schengen and British visa,” said Andrew Murphy, chairman of the UK-China Visa Alliance. Last month, during a visit to China, George Osborne also launched a new phase of the Culture is Great campaign, which aims to promote the kind of memories visitors can make in Britain and encourages tourists to share pictures and stories. What's in a name? Mandarin names given to celebrities, events, places and food tend to be literal descriptions of how they are viewed. The suggestions so far for Scotland’s Highland Games are “Warrior Games” and “Special Skirt Party”.Long Welsh village names such as Llanfairpwllgwyngyll have been called “Martian Village” or “Word Puzzle Town” while Dorset’s Cerne Abbas Giant, a chalk hill figure famously depicting a large naked man, was called “Fertility Giant”. And Hadrian’s Wall in the north of England was named “The Stone Wall”, “Freedom Road”, or “Mountain Earthworm”. Already established names in China include Jian Qiao – Sword Bridge – for Cambridge. Shakespeare is Sha Weng, meaning Mr Sha, Rowan Atkinson’s Mr Bean character is Han Dou, meaning “funny beans” and Benedict Cumberbatch is known as Curly Fu because of his floppy hair, with fu being short for Holmes in Mandarin. In London, names with an Oriental flavour are needed for The Shard, the Tower of London’s Beefeaters, The Mall, Kensington Palace and Hampton Court Palace. • Find more fascinating articles at China Daily • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:49:08.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
