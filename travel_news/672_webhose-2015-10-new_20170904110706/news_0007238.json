As well as more passengers on Norwegian to Malaga; SAS services particularly to Stockholm; and Etihad saw more passengers travelling to Abu Dhabi.\nGordon Dewar, Chief Executive of Edinburgh Airport said:\n“It’s fantastic to see our new routes are working well for our passengers – with over one million passengers through the doors at Edinburgh Airport last month and in every one of the last five months.\n“This success is thanks particularly to the increased services from Flybe to London City and the recently launched Etihad service to Abu Dhabi. We’ve listened to our passengers for domestic connectivity and start an Edinburgh to Liverpool service with Flybe at the end of the month. We’re also launching Stuttgart with EasyJet in early November. It’s great that we can continue to announce new routes and services throughout the winter months.”\nIn 2014, Edinburgh Airport saw 10.2 million passengers use their airport. Edinburgh Airport has been experiencing its busiest year ever, after having five consecutive million passenger months, with a moving annual total of 10.89 million passengers.\nSource:-Edinburgh Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:58:06.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
