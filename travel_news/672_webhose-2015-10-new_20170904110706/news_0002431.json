The product, which is designed to alert a driver to situations where driver fatigue and other dangers are likely to occur, has already been embraced in the hundreds by various oil companies for their fleet of vehicles to be used in applications within the oil, mining and gas industry in Indonesia.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275144\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275145LOGO\nThe RVS-MR688 Driver Fatigue Monitoring System is designed to not only accurately predict and identify situations where drowsiness and fatigue may be setting into a driver, but also to alert those drivers so that they can pull over to the side of the road and take other necessary steps to insure their general safety and the safety of other drivers.\nWhen the RVS-MR688 Driver Fatigue Monitoring System is installed, a single camera is placed on the dashboard of the vehicle in question with the lens facing the driver's face at all times. From the moment the ignition in the car fires, the camera is always on and is always monitoring the driver's face for signs of fatigue. Because of this, it can recognize how a person's face changes when fatigue begins to set in and will play an audible alert, helping to keep them attentive and focused on the road in front of them at all times.\nWhen you're driving in an official capacity for a business in the oil, gas and other mining industries, fatigue is a constant danger. These drivers need to work long hours in order to get important products and other materials to factories, job sites and other locations and are constantly working to beat very strict deadlines. As a result, fatigue here is much more likely to occur than it is in a casual driver.\nThe most pressing danger comes from the fact that the driver may not be immediately aware of just how likely they are to fall asleep at the wheel. Thanks to Rear View Safety and the RVS-MR688 Driver Fatigue Monitoring System, however, they will never have to question themselves again - they will know beyond the shadow of a doubt.\nTo find out more information about the RVS-MR688 Driver Fatigue Monitoring System , or to learn more about the high quality road safety products that Rear View Safety produces on a regular basis, please visit the company's official website at www.rearviewsafety.com .\nRear View Safety is not a stranger to the world of safety enhancing products for drivers and vehicles of all types. Recently they introduced GoVue, the first backup camera smartphone app for the popular iOS and Android operating systems. Once the smartphone and camera system are connected via a short-range Wi-Fi network, video information from the rear of the vehicle is transmitted to the smartphone in real time. This eliminates the need for a primary monitor to be installed into the dashboard of the vehicle in question. The GoVue backup camera application for iOS and Android devices is currently available for free download in the Google Play Store , the iTunes App Store .\nThe commercial backup camera provider is also available on Facebook , on Twitter , and maintains a Road Safety Resource site.\nMedia Contact:\nJames Grossbaum\n800-764-1028\n releases/driver-fatigue-monitoring-system-by-rear-view-safety-enhances-road-safety--vehicle-safeguards-300156474.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH23092&Transmission_Id=201510080845PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH23092&DateId=20151008", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=luzheng.cam.govue&hl=en", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://twitter.com/rearviewsafety?lang=en", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/driver-fatigue-monitoring-system-by-rear-view-safety-enhances-road-safety--vehicle-safeguards-300156474.html", "https://www.facebook.com/RearViewSafety", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275145LOGO", "http://www.rearviewsafety.com/safety/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/govue/id940452236?mt=8", "http://www.rearviewsafety.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/275144", "http://www.rearviewsafety.com/driver-fatigue-monitoring-system.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:51:48.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
