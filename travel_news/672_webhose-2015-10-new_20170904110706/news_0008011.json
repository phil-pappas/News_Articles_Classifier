These introductions to Airwheel A3 gained the appreciation from all walks of life.The built-in electronic brake system of Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter A3 is worth noting. The previous models have no similar electronic brake system and one needs to stand still on the scooter to release brake. Therefore, it brings about a brake lag. Sometimes, there is barely time for the rider to stop his electric self-balancing scooter by standing still. The mode of brake is obviously applicable to the emergencies. The application of the electronic brake system to Airwheel A3 reverses the situation completely. Merely pressing the button near the LED screen to activate the brake system, the rider can stop his Airwheel A3 at once. Safety is what matters in the process of riding scooters, and others are of secondary importance.

Without the timely brake, they are likely bump into other vehicles or obstacles. The clash may cause hurt and blur their passion for ride at the same time. Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter A3 can brake not only by standing still but also by pressing the button of electronic brake system, which offers a considerate guarantee for the beginners. The electronic brake system is just one of example for Airwheelâ€™s progresses in technology. It is reasonable to assume that more advanced technologies will be introduced to Airwheel electric scooters in the near future. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:00:57.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
