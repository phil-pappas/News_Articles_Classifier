Not so much, for some local skiers.\nWhile Colorado's biggest ski resorts keep adding new terrain, some smaller resorts pride themselves on staying small. They're places where you can park close, bring a sack lunch and get to know your liftie.\nColorado's \"Gems\" are eight smaller resorts that participate in the Gems Card program , which offers two-for-one lift tickets at each resort through the season with the purchase of a $20 Gems Card.\nThe Gems are a good way to save money. But they also provide a more nostalgic ski experience, without the flair of high-profile amenities, said Jennifer Rudolph of Colorado Ski Country USA, the organization that represents all the state's ski areas that aren't a part of Vail Resorts .\nBut the Gems have the same powder as the big resorts, she added.\n\"Gems resorts help guests remember what skiing and the mountains are really about,\" Rudolph said.\nBut what Colorado's small resorts are most known for doesn't show up on the map or a sheet of mountain stats.\n\"These resorts often stand out because of their friendly employees and the personal interactions guests have,\" Rudolph said. \"It's that warm, individual attention that keeps Gem skiers coming back.\"\nIf you're not already familiar with Colorado's diamonds in the rough, here's a brief overview:\nMonarch Ski and Snowboard Resort\nwww.skimonarch.com\nAdvertisement Monarch is just remote enough, just off-the-radar enough to hold onto powder long after a storm. And after 25 years of adventurous cat skiing, it knows how to get you to the powder — cat-skiing guests at Monarch can lap up six hours of skiing per day and get 8,000 to 10,000 total vertical feet.\n\"Monarch is definitely one of those true hidden gems. ... It's so worth the extra little drive to check it out,\" Rudolph said. \"And that's part of what makes it special — it's not necessarily a day-ski area from the Front Range.\"\nThe mountain also has amenities for the kids — ski school, magic carpet, etc. — plus expert terrain for mom and dad.\nPowderhorn Resort\nwww.powderhorn.com\nOn the edge of the Grand Mesa, 35 minutes from Grand Junction, Powderhorn sits at 4,000 feet above the valley floor and is a gem for its different views — desert beyond the snow. The large day-lodge deck and its views make it a favorite for après ski.\nNew this season, Powderhorn will unveil the Flat Top Flyer, a Poma high-speed quad chairlift that will carry skiers and riders 1,600 vertical feet in about 6 minutes. \"I think the new chairlift is going to impress folks who haven't been in a while,\" Rudolph said.\nAnother reason to check out Powderhorn: \"There's excellent tree skiing you'd have to visit to know about.\"\nCooper\nwww.skicooper.com\nCooper (formerly known as Ski Cooper — it rebranded this year) prides itself on being different from its larger neighbors by offering skiing the way it used to be: affordable and family-friendly.\nFor history buffs, Cooper offers nods to Colorado's rich snowsports history, like the 10th Mountain Division's on-snow reunion here every year.\nBut they're not ignoring modern ways to get around the mountain. Chicago Ridge Backcountry Ski Tours take riders and skiers at Cooper to 2,600 acres of open-powder bowls, glades and timber in the San Isabel and White River National Forests.\nSki Granby Ranch\nwww.granbyranch.com\nSki Granby Ranch bills itself as one of Colorado's most family-friendly ski mountains. Granby Ranch is a favorite for experienced skiers who want their kids to learn in a safe, friendly environment. There's parking near the base, there are easy-access lifts, and the terrain was created specifically to be family-friendly — all trails begin at one point and end at the base, so parents and children can ski at their own level without getting lost.\n\"You can have the glass of wine at après while your kids lap the chairlift, and you can practically see them the whole time,\" Rudolph said.\nSunlight Mountain Resort\nwww.sunlightmountain.com\nNear Glenwood Springs, Sunlight Mountain Resort likes to keep it simple. All 67 trails lead right back to the lodge, where brown-bag lunches are welcome.\nAnother boon for families: Sunlight's Ski, Swim, Stay deal includes hot springs access in Glenwood Springs, and kids 12 and under ski free.\nSunlight also claims to have the steepest run in Colorado — for four turns, said Rudolph. The Heathen clocks in at 52 degrees.\nSo there are some challenges on the mountain, Rudolph said. \"It's good for families but also for people who want to ski more aggressively.\"\nLoveland Ski Area\nwww.skiloveland.com\nAt 53 miles west of Denver, Loveland is the go-to resort for many locals. It has 1,800 acres of terrain that includes long bump runs, high alpine bowls and free snowcat skiing along the Continental Divide.\nLoveland is a resort that some skiers drive right by on Interstate 70 without realizing how big it is, Rudolph said. \"There's more than what you see at the base area next to the tunnel.\"\nFor Denver residents with out-of-town guests who want to try skiing, Loveland is an affordable option. Ticket prices here tend to be lower than at Loveland's bigger neighbors, and because it's so close, you won't have to spring for lodging in the high country.\nArapahoe Basin Resort\nwww.arapahoebasin.com\nArapahoe Basin is famous for having the state's longest ski season. Its high elevation (base elevation, 10,780 feet; summit elevation, 13,050 feet) allows it to be open mid-October to mid-June. After skiing the steeps on the East Wall and off of Pallavicini Lift, locals like to hang out at \"The Beach,\" front-row parking that backs up to the three lower-mountain chairlifts.\nA-Basin's new Guest Services center includes a stage on the ticket office steps. \"They have a lot of spring festivals and events and live music, and with this stage, it'll be more concert-like, they'll be able to put on a bigger show,\" Rudolph said.\nAlso, if your kiddos missed the new children's center that opened at the end of last season, check it out this year.\nEldora Mountain Resort\nwww.eldora.com\nThe \"backyard\" ski area, Eldora is 21 miles from Boulder and 45 miles from Denver. Eldora is a great place to teach the little ones to ski. Parents can enroll their children in the \"Eldorables\" program, which offers weekly lessons for five-week sessions or teach the kids themselves on four easy, user-friendly lifts and one surface tow bordering the resort's parking lot.\nChryss Cada is a freelance writer and an adjunct professor in Colorado State University's School of Journalism.
