This is the fourth award in two years that the NEC has received for its work to minimise the negative impact its operations have on the environment. \nThe latest award adds to an already impressive list, which includes; the Exhibition News Eco Award, the Birmingham City Council Sustainability and Recycling Award and the Birmingham Post Environmental Award. The industry leading BIFM Awards recognise and showcase best in class facilities management and evidence its impact on business, the economy and society. Commenting on the NEC’s success in the Impact on Sustainability category, Judges said: “The NEC’s entry provides a compelling example of best practise in waste management. Whilst operating a unique, extremely challenging and constantly changing environment, they set themselves targets, regularly beat them and then go back and set themselves even more ambitious objectives.” With over two million visitors attending around 500 events each year, the NEC regularly monitors the environmental impact of all its operations and undertakes key projects to make the venue as environmentally responsible as possible. Brian Pell, Group Operations Director, said: “The NEC has been operating at zero waste to landfill since 2012 which was thanks, in part, to the launch of an on-site waste pre-treatment centre. We have also recently installed smart meters across our site to reduce our C02 emissions which to date has reduced emissions by 742 tonnes – enough to make 1,045,070 cups of tea. We are thrilled that the work we do has once again been recognised. We were nominated alongside some of the biggest companies in the UK so to have been successful in this category is true testament to the hard work of our venue team.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:38:15.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
