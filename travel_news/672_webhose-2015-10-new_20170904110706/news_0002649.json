Deliveries are to start before the end of the year.\n \nLike its predecessor, the new H145 Mercedes-Benz Style is tailored for high-end private and corporate operations. It offers a versatile and stylish cabin that has been upgraded to fulfil the highest expectations in terms of refinement, comfort and quality.\n \n“Inspired by the top-of-the-range vehicles of the brand with the star, the H145 Mercedes-Benz Style offers a redesigned cabin interior that includes in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity, an improved infotainment system and new seat design for increased ergonomic comfort” said Frederic Lemos, Airbus Helicopters’ Head of Private & Business Aviation Europe. “Customers wishing to further personalise their aircraft will be able to work directly with Airbus Helicopters and the creative design teams at Mercedes-Benz Style to define their unique cabin environment”.\n \n \nThe aircraft is proposed in three different harmonies that customers can combine with a real wooden floor or a choice of sophisticated carpets. The interior liners and the new light concept also contribute to the elegant and welcoming interior atmosphere. Multi-purpose storage is made possible by numerous attachment points on the floor and walls and a new and perfectly integrated cabinet, offering increased storage volume.\n \n \nWith its unrivalled modular interior, the H145 Mercedes-Benz Style offers extreme cabin arrangement flexibility for a broad range of travels: executive transportation, exploration tourism, family voyages, as well as leisure and sport trips. All seats, galley and walls are mounted on rails and can be easily reconfigured from four to eight passengers – or removed to transport more luggage or large items. The aircraft is extremely compact making it also the ideal choice for super yacht owners.\n \n \nOffering the widest range of helicopters for private and business operations, Airbus Helicopters is the market leader with more than 400 helicopters sold in the last five years in this segment.\n \nSource:- Airbus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:12:14.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
