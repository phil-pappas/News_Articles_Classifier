Photo courtesy of Denver Travelers are spending more time in airports thanks to things like longer security lines and airline flight delays. With that, airports around the world realize that they have a captive audience that’s willing to spend money in their terminals. So they have stepped up their efforts to go after those dollars by offering new and unusual food/beverage, retail and service offerings. Six airports have gone above and beyond by offering unique and unusual concessions and services for travelers.\nLos Angeles has a 7-Eleven , the Dallas-based company’s first in an airport, located in the pre-security area in the Tom Bradley International Terminal. The store offers items similar to the ones in its local stores, including fresh and hot foods, beverages and snacks, along with travel-size personal care products and nonfood items. And yes -- you can also get Slurpees, along with coffee, tea and cappuccino. The store is open from 6:00 a.m. to midnight.\nAre you into golf? Then you will love the Professional Golf Association’s PGA MSP at Minneapolis-St. Paul . Located on the second level of the Airport Mall in Terminal 1-Lindbergh , the 12,000-square-foot PGA MSP offers access to golf simulators, putting greens, a pro shop, swing analyzer and professional golf lessons. Fees range from $10 to use the putting green and lounge up to $120 for a 60-minute PGA professional lesson, including simulator time.\nYou know this has happened to you. You’re running late and you’ve driven to the airport, hoping that you’ll be able to find a parking space quickly.\nBaltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport has eliminated that problem in its hourly, daily and express parking lots. The hourly and daily lots have red, green and blue lights above each parking space to show if it’s occupied, available or reserved for the disabled. These lots also show how many parking spaces are available on each level. The express lot only shows how many spaces are available, but has guides to lead you to parking spaces. And once you’ve parked, a shuttle bus will come to your car and load your luggage.\nThe worst has happened - you’ve gotten sick while traveling. If you happen to be at Nashville , you’re in luck, because it’s home to Care Here, a walk-in clinic and pharmacy . It offers medical services including treating colds and common illnesses, performing annual physicals, dispensing basic medications, filling prescriptions, selling over-the-counter health products and administering flu shots.\nMost airport cell phone parking lots offer a parking space and, if you’re lucky, a nice view of the runway. But the lot at Denver is a major upgrade , with parking spaces and a building while you wait. The Final Approach facility features free Wi-Fi in the building and parking lot, a children’s seating area with iPads built into tabletops with access to games, lounge seating, indoor restrooms, eight flight information display boards and access to a gas station. And if you’re hungry, the lot offers Baja Fresh Mexican Grill a Dunkin’ Donuts with a 24-hour drive through, Subway, Wendy's and zpizza.\nFinally, let’s say you have a long layover or delay at Philadelphia and you crave some peace a quiet. The answer is Minute Suites , which offers 13 private suites and two workstation cubicles located in the airport’s A/B Link. Inside each suite is a daybed sofa with fresh pillows and blankets, a sound-masking system that neutralizes noise, and an audio program that helps deliver the equivalent of three hours of sleep in only 26 minutes. Suites also feature a high-definition television with access to DirecTV, the Internet and flight-tracking information.", "external_links": ["http://www.phl.org/", "http://corp.7-eleven.com/news/06-02-2015-final-approach-7-eleven-opens-first-airport-terminal-store-in-us", "https://www.flynashville.com/", "http://www.carehere.com/airport.html", "http://parking.bwiairport.com/", "http://minutesuites.com/locations/philadelphia-international/", "http://www.pgamsp.com/", "http://www.flydenver.com/parking_transit/parking/cell-phone-waiting-lot", "http://mspairport.com/images/accessibility/MSP_quickmap_access_9-12-11.aspx", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/n/Q/SN1_7028-S.jpg", "http://www.lawa.org/welcomeLAX.aspx", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/airports/fl/You-Wonrsquot-Believe-the-Services-Available-in-these-Six-Airports.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/n/Q/SN1_7028-S.jpg&description=Six", "http://www.bwiairport.com/en"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:10:08.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
