Investing directly is cheaper than going through intermediaries as customer is not required to pay fee to the distributors.\nWhile, fund houses also allow sale of their products online through their own websites.\nA number of fund houses are already focusing on ‘direct plan’ mode to sell their schemes, a move that may maximise the returns for the investors as against regular plans involving distributors.\nSince no fees need to be paid to distributors, expense ratio gets lower in direct plans, which eventually leads to higher returns for the investors.\nBesides, Sebi discussed measures for simplifying the on-boarding process of retail investors. It noted several ideas to remove in-person verifications (IPVs), speeding up the KYC (Know Your Customer) processes via KRAs’ (KYC Registration Agencies).\nTo streamline the distribution model for increasing the retail investors’ base, Sebi is looking into measures to enhance investor trust, lower cost of customer acquisition and provide for an online only distribution model.\nFurthermore, the markets regulator is in talks with fund houses to allow investors to invest in mutual fund products by using the Aadhaar number.\n 25, 2015 12:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:22:19.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
