Thousands say No to terrorism. \nMasses of people including tourists on Saturday marched down Istanbul's main centralavenue to protest the twin suspected suicide bombings in the Turkish capital Ankara that killed at least 86 people. \nNot long after the attack social media in Turkey was on fire in indignation, and calls for people to take to the streets in protest were answered in both Istanbul and Diyabakir, with civic groups, organisations, unions and concerned citizens joining HDP supporters and officials. \nThe estimated crowd of 10,000 filled Istiklal Street in central Istanbul, with police maintaining a heavy presence but not intervening, an AFP photographer said. \nSome carried placards reading \"the state is a killer\" and \"we know the murderers\", echoing allegations of state responsibility made in the aftermath of the attack but denied by the government. \nProtests were also taking place in several other Turkish cities including Izmir on the Aegean and southeastern cities such as Batman and Diyarbakir, the Dogan news agency reported. \nA protest earlier in Diyarbakir had ended with police using tear gas to disperse protesters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:52:35.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
