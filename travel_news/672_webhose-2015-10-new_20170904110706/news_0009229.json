Witnesses described how the 51-year-old victim staggered from his car, which had been stationery at the junction of St John Street and Wycliff Street, close to City University, clutching his chest and screaming for help. The victim survived the attack, but spent more than a month in hospital recovering from his injuries. Police said they believed Mr and Mrs Adams had left the country shortly after the shooting and efforts to trace them proved fruitless, although they were rumoured to be in Spain or the Netherlands. Mr Adams was one of 11 children brought up in a working class Irish Catholic family in the Barnsbury area of Islington, close to where Tony Blair and his wife Cherie made their home before moving into Downing Street. In 2007 Terry was jailed for seven years after admitting a single specimen charge of money laundering . Terry Adams was jailed in 2007 He was released from prison three years later, but was subsequently recalled to jail for breaching the terms of his licence. Last year a judge ordered him to hand over £650,000 proceeds of crime, after Mr Adams failed to convince the court he had spent all his money. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “ A husband and wife have been charged following their extradition from the Netherlands in relation to a shooting that took place in St John Street, EC1 in December 2013. “Patrick Adams, 59, and Constance Adams, 55, were charged on Thursday, 22 October, with attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.” The couple will appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:54:38.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
