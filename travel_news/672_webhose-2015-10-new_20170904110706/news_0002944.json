The trams will have low floors and 12 side doors, enabling access for all, including those with reduced mobility.\nThe design, intended to be sympathetic to the city’s architecture, will be similar to that of the 74 Citadis trams already supplied by Alstom for the 31km tramway Line 1. Since opening in December 2012 ridership on Line 1 has increased by more than 30%, necessitating a second line.\nThe 22.5km Line 2 will link Ain Sebaa in the east with the city’s main hospital in the central district of Hermitage, running via El Badr, Laayoune, and Mers Sultan and interchanging with Line 1 at Abdelmoumen and Ibn Tachfine stations. Preparatory construction of Line 2, including utilities diversion works, began in May this year and major construction is scheduled to start next May. The new line is set to open in late 2018.\nAssembly of the trams will take place at Alstom’s La Rochelle plant in France and deliveries will start in July 2017. The order will be 65%-financed by the French Government and 35% by the Moroccan Government.\nYoussef Draiss, Managing Director of Casa Transports, will be attending International Railway Summit 2016. Mr Draiss will take part in one-to-one consultation meetings with participating solution providers throughout the summit.\n \nSource:- Alstom", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:40:06.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
