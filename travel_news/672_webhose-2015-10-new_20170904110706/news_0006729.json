I think he had a bad day and was taking it out on me with a bad attitude,” Sharp said of the flight attendant in an interview with Hawaii News Now . Witnesses said Sharp threw a drink can at a flight attendant on Allegiant Air. Supplied.

Fellow passengers claim Sharp became belligerently drunk during her flight out of Las Vegas. Facebook. Source: Facebook \nOther passengers told police that Sharp was “drunk and belligerent”, swore, exposed her breasts to the cabin and threw a soda can at the employee. Sharp said she was trying to throw the can in rubbish bin. \n“It was an unfortunate incident to have with the flight attendant,” Sharp said. \n“However, I do feel that he was very rude to me and there was definitely a lack of manners and etiquette.” \nSharp’s boyfriend, Bryant Clark, was on the flight, too. \n“She’s not a criminal by any means,” Clark said. \n“She’s a sweetheart, she’s a good person. She was tired. She was a little bit grumpy. I think that the flight attendant wasn’t doing things to de-escalate the situation.” \nWitnesses said Sharp fell asleep after the incident. She has not been charged, but the investigation is ongoing. \nAllegiant Air said in a statement it could not comment on the incident because it is part of an ongoing investigation. But it did release a statement that said the US Federal Aviation Administration regulations prohibit the use of e-cigarettes while on board an aircraft, and also require that all passengers comply with crew member instructions to ensure the safety of all on board. \nIn Australia, e-cigarettes including e-cigars and other personal vaporisers containing batteries must be in carry-on baggage only and the use on board and the recharging of these devices is strictly prohibited. \nAllegiant Air has been contacted by news.com.au for further comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:03:28.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
