From Branwen ferch Llŷr to Gwenllian, and Llywelyn the Great to Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, the audio guides each link to a specific theme on the Wales History Map, and can be downloaded and listened to while exploring sites.\nAnd to help visitors get in the mood for historic adventures, the Welsh Government has collaborated with Trac Cymru to create the Ultimate Welsh Road Trip Soundtrack.\nFeaturing songs from the likes of Welsh songstress Duffy and award-winning folk group 9Bach, the soundtrack, available on the Cadw website, includes a playlist of songs by Welsh artists to complement the historic themes.\nThe Wales History Map is the latest product of the Welsh Government’s Pan-Wales Interpretation Plan, which aims to bring Wales’s heritage to life for locals and visitors to explore and enjoy, while maximising the economic value of heritage tourism.\nAround 42 million* British tourism visits were made to destinations in Wales during the first six months of 2015, and it is hoped that the new online resource will inspire more to visit heritage sites across Wales during 2015 and 2016.\nKen Skates AM, Deputy Minister for Culture, Sport and Tourism, said: “We’re always looking for new and innovative ways of making Wales’s heritage more accessible and engaging for visitors, and the Wales History Map succeeds in doing that.\n“By working closely with heritage partners, sites from across Wales have been linked together based on common themes. This encourages visitors to learn about the fascinating stories which make up Wales’s history, and visit sites associated with the stories – regardless of who owns or cares for them.\n“Working with partners on a pan-Wales approach significantly improves the visitor experience, with tourists and locals given the opportunity to learn and engage with characters and stories from Wales’s past in a coherent and consistent way. The additional resources such as audio guides and soundtrack will also add to the overall experience, and will hopefully attract more visitors to Welsh heritage sites during the autumn.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:12:54.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
