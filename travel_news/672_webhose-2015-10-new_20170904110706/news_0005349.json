According to USA Today, the suit \"alleges that TOTE Maritime and Davidson were negligent in choosing to sail a 41-year-old cargo ship into dangerous weather.\" The cargo ship, El Faro, which was heading for Puerto Rico , was caught in the seas during Hurricane Joaquin. A few days after they departed, they were out at sea during the hurricane, and reported that they had lost power and were \"taking on water.\" At that point, according to the article, the hurricane \"was a Category 4, with winds in excess of 120 mph churning 50-foot waves.\"\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140714/126845\nThe lawsuit is regarding one man out of 33 crew members, however Legal-Bay expects others to file suit, as is typically the case in ship wreck cases. Items were found during searches, including a survival suit with \"unidentifiable remains inside\" and \"a heavily damaged lifeboat and other debris.\" No survivors or other remains were found, and the Coast Guard recently ended the search. The man's mother released a statement, questioning why her son and his coworkers were sent into the storm.\nPatty Kirby , COO and Head of Client Relations, commented on the wrongful death Jones Act lawsuit, \"We are a leading company when it comes to personal injury accidents or wrongful death cases that occur at sea. However, what seems to be most tragic about this is that had the Captain just followed the obvious weather reports, it could have been avoided. The real life tragic circumstances are eerily similar to that of the Hollywood movie, 'The Perfect Storm.'\"\nLegal-Bay is committed to assisting victims involved in all personal injury, maritime law on the ocean or Mississippi River, wrongful death suits, or Jones Act cases, including boats, yachts, cruise ships, fishing boats, or other water vessel accidents, as well as other water accident cases such as hotel or residential swimming pools or water or amusement park accidents.
