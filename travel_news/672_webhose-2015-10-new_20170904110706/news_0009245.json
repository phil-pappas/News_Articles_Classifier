Contributed Cars For Sale \nGOODBYES are never easy, particularly when we are forced to farewell Australia's premier party island. \nBut before XXXX Island calls last drinks, Lion will offer six Aussies the chance to enjoy the tropical paradise one last time. The prized spots are being offered through a charity auction on eBay , with bidding open until 2pm AEST on Monday. Since welcoming the first visitors ashore in 2012, XXXX Island has given more than 3,000 Aussies the chance to kick back; catching the fish of the day, enjoying a BBQ, or reconnecting with mates over a beer or two on the idyllic southern Great Barrier Reef. Could you imagine yourself relaxing on XXXX Island? \nAlong with the final six trips to the island, XXXX is also offered up 29 items of memorabilia that XXXX owners Lion say will help the memory of the island live on in our \"hearts and homes\". \nThe island's \"loo with a view\", 19th hole tinnie and even a signed 2009 Wallabies jersey. All funds raised will go to water protection group Reef Check Australia. Even with plenty of prized memorabilia up for the grabs, XXXX marketing manager Jack Mesley said the trips to the island will be the most sought after.\"It's the final six trips ever to XXXX Island, where the winning bidder can also take three mates, which will no doubt be the hottest items in the auction,\" he said.\"If it's your dream to get to XXXX Island, now is the time to rally your mates, raid your coin jars, look under your couch cushions for loose change and pool together a winning bid.\" Catching cobia offshore from XXXX Island: They may not be the prettiest fish in the sea, but the cobia will put up a hell of a fight.
