The flight represented the first opportunity for Oman Air to showcase its iconic new aircraft. \nThe flight was hosted by Oman Air 's Chief Executive Officer, Paul Gregorowitsch, and members of his senior management team, accompanied by VIPs, high-ranking government officials, dignitaries from public and private sector organisations, and media representatives. They also offered warm welcome to the guest of honour, His Excellency Dr Mohammed bin Nasser Al Zaabi, Chief Executive Officer of Oman's Public Authority for Civil Aviation (PACA). The inaugural Dreamliner flight departed Muscat at 0845 and arrived in Salalah one and a half hours later. Each guest was amongst the first to enjoy Oman Air 's outstanding Dreamliner passenger experience, prior to the aircraft entering scheduled service on routes to destinations in the Middle East and Europe. \nPaul Gregorowitsch comments: \"I am delighted to welcome our esteemed guests aboard Oman Air 's first Dreamliner flight to Salalah. And I would like to offer special thanks to His Excellency Dr Mohammed Al-Zaabi for taking the time to be with us today.\n\"This is the first chance we have had to demonstrate the exceptional passenger experience that Oman Air 's Dreamliner offers. It is also a wonderful opportunity to for us to thank the people of Salalah for their invaluable support by enabling them to become some of the first in the world to see our Dreamliner in action. \n\"The Dreamliner features Oman Air 's newly-designed, spacious and comfortable Business Class and Economy Class cabins, which ensure a relaxing and enjoyable flight. In addition, it offers the latest inflight entertainment technology, delicious inflight dining and, of course, our world-renowned Omani hospitality. \n\"The aircraft is set to become the centerpiece of Oman Air 's long haul fleet and it is thrilling to see the Dreamliner in its glorious Oman Air livery.\" \nHis Excellency Dr Mohammed Bin Nasser Al-Zaabi adds: \n\"I would like to congratulate Oman Air on the introduction to its fleet of this outstanding new aircraft. This is a very special day in the history of Oman's aviation sector. It will be a pleasure to join Paul Gregorowitsch, his team and my fellow guests aboard this inaugural flight.

A 17-inch personal monitor enables access to the aircraft's state-of-the-art inflight entertainment (IFE) technology, with its huge range of the latest movies, music, games and information.

It also offers 40 percent more range, produces 20 percent fewer emissions and generates a 60 percent smaller noise footprint than other aircraft in its class.
