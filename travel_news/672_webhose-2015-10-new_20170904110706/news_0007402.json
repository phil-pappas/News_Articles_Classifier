Located pre-security on the departures level, the 24,000-square-foot container garden is planted with blue potatoes, herbs and vegetables including beets and arugula. The airline plans to provide the food for some of the terminalâ€™s restaurants, donate some of the harvest to local pantries and eventually supply the potatoes to the Terra company, which makes its signature in-flight blue potato chips. Passengers can visit the curbside farm, and JetBlue plans to offer it as an agricultural model for local schools.\nOFFSETTING EMISSIONS IN SAN DIEGO\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
