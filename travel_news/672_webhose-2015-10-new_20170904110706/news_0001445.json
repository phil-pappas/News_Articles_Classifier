Perfect for a family holiday or couples getaway, there really is something festive to suit every taste and budget. \nCelebrations kick off in late November with the Watson’s Mill Christmas market and fine art sale. Taking place every Saturday and Sunday from 21 November to 6 December, visitors can experience the historic Mill in all its Christmas glory, with vendors offering baked goods and food gifts, clothing and accessories, hand-made bath and spa products, and all forms of art. Also not to be missed is the festive edition of the Ottawa Farmers’ Market, held each weekend between the 28 November and 20 December at the Aberdeen Pavilion at Lansdowne Park. The market is the biggest of its kind in North America and is a mecca for delicious seasonal local fresh produce. \nThe Help Santa Toy Parade gives kids the chance to see Father Christmas up close on 21 November. Now in 46th year the parade is organised by Ottawa’s firefighters and draws tens-of-thousands of revellers who line the route from Wellington Street to Bank Street to Laurier Avenue to Elgin Street. The chartable event, which includes floats, bands and clowns, encourages people to donate toys and other gifts to help disadvantaged local children. \nThe city’s spectacular Christmas Lights Across Canada programme takes place from 2 December until 7 January in the vicinity around Parliament Hill and Confederation Boulevard. The area will be transformed into a remarkable lightshow, guaranteed to put visitors in a festive mood, and there will also be a massive Christmas tree festooned with decorations inside the Great Hall of the National Gallery of Canada. More atmospheric light shows can be enjoyed in nearby Upper Canada Village with Alight at Night. Almost a million lights will light up the historic settlement on selected dates between 4 December and 2 January. \nFor those in search of a festive night out with a difference, be sure to visit the Canadian Museum of Nature for its Nature Nocturne Winter Wonderland event on 27 November. Discover four floors of world-class exhibitions while meeting artists throughout the galleries. What’s more, expect top notch DJs to fill the dance floor with awesome sounds until midnight. \nIf you want to catch a seasonal show, try the National Arts Center.
