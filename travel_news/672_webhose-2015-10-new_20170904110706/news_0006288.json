The 2012 Dutchtown High School graduate was scheduled to return later this month from a six-month deployment, her father said after her death.\n“I didn’t say goodbye, I didn’t want to say goodbye,” Michael Ruiz said. “I just told her I would see her later and I never got that chance.”\nRuiz’s body will arrive in Georgia on Tuesday afternoon at Atlanta South Regional Airport and will leave Tara Field at 1 p.m. From there, numerous law enforcement agencies, including Henry County police and sheriff’s deputies and the Butts County Sheriff’s Office, will escort her to Ruiz’s family’s hometown of Jackson.\nThe route for the escort will be from Highway 19/41 southbound, to Highway 16 East to Jackson. From there, the route will be from Covington Street to Lewis Sims Funeral Home. Those wishing to participate in the “Hero’s Welcome” for Ruiz are asked to line the streets with flags around 1:30 p.m.\nThe funeral for Ruiz will be held at 10 a.m. Friday at Zion Baptist Church in Jackson. Interment will follow at Georgia National Cemetery in Canton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:37:48.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
