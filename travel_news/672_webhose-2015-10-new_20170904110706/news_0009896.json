Industry experts predict that by 2020 a new personal transport age will have dawned on our roads and highways. Technologies being developed that will drive the revolution as much as cylinders under the bonnet include inter-vehicle communications systems and augmented reality dashboards. Car manufacturers including Ford, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Chevrolet and Hyundai are all developing and testing technologies heading for a driverless nirvana. Imagine automatically braking round a blind bend because an unseen car has signalled that it is coming in the other direction Cars talking to each other by using vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems (V2V) will play a big part in that future. Human error is one of the biggest causes of accidents, and V2V is designed to eliminate overconfident or just plain bad driving. Cars telling each other how far from junctions they are, and how fast they are approaching, all in less time than it takes to blink, will enable vehicles to brake, accelerate or even stop outright. Taking evasive action because of another car’s position or speed should reduce impact crashes considerably. Massachusetts Institute of Technology is developing one such V2V system, collecting information from around cars via a system of sensors, radar and cellular telephone signals. In addition to V2V, the development of vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, or V2I, is also advancing. So in the near future, everything from road signs, traffic lights and yes, even speed cameras, will be able to signal information to the vehicle on safety issues. Imagine automatically braking round a blind bend because an unseen car has signalled that it is coming in the other direction. With the technology already here to stop a car if a driver fails to put on the brakes, and cars which can park themselves, this would take it to the next level. Most industry commentators note that, by 2020, driver override systems, such as cars which brake even if the driver pumps the accelerator, will be available. The GPS generated route ahead could highlight the actual lane you need to be in A study by America’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2010 suggests that coupling V2V and V2I in vehicles would reduce all target vehicle crashes by a whopping 81 per cent. Sending a child off to university in a new car with such a tech spec would render the call back home when they get there safely redundant for most anxious parents. Augmented reality dashboards are coming too. AR displays will be projected onto windscreen glass, pushing overlay information on top of the real road ahead. Red boxes might appear if you get too close to the car in front at the speed you’re driving, or the GPS generated route ahead could highlight the actual lane you need to be in and show you where you need to turn without you ever having to take your eyes off the road.
