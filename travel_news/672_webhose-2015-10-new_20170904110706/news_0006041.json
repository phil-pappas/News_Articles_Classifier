This year’s ibtm knowledge programme is going to be full of inspiring and engaging content, which we hope everyone will make the most of and enjoy. \n“We’re particularly excited about Christine Renaud’s session; Brain Dating: The Next Frontier For Events. In this session, based on the case study of a partnership between C2 Montréal & E-180, social entrepreneur and CEO of E-180 will share her best practices to boost the peer-learning component of events. Following the presentation, attendees will be invited to test this unique approach by using the mobile app Braindater which will create spontaneous brain dates.” \nNegative Brainstorming: Using The Power Of The “Pre-Mortem” To Reveal Problems Before They Happen is also set to draw in the crowds. Presented by Brandt Krueger, Owner of Event Technology Consulting, the session invites participants to think creatively and critically about their events and meetings. \nKrueger comments, “In pre-mortems, stakeholders are encouraged to imagine the worst possible outcomes of their projects - and then try to make sure they never happen. Using this business strategy promoted by the likes of authors, economists, and critical thinkers, I will challenge participants to change the way that they think about meetings. “ \nFinally, in partnership with ISES and presented by Héctor A. Venegas, Chief Executive Officer and Partner of SwarmWorks Ltd. and Heiner Koppermann, Co-founder and CEO of SwarmWorks Ltd. (Germany) and SwarmWorks, Inc.
