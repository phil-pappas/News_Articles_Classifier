Get a taste of local craft spirits and one of the world’s largest displays of art by Bay Area artists on a different itinerary. You can always have wine with dinner. \nGet there: From San Francisco, take BART to El Cerrito del Norte Station. From there, catch the Vine bus (29 Express). Total round-trip fare for both: about $19.60. \nDoze: The Andaz Napa is smack in downtown Napa. 1450 First St.; (707) 687-1234; www.napa.andaz.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html. Rates start at $269. \nDine: Wind up your hard day with southern Italian cuisine at Oenotri, conveniently close to your hotel. 1425 First St.; (707) 252-1022; www.oenotri.com. \nDo: Take a tour of the buildings and gardens at di Rosa , a gigantic collection of modern and contemporary artworks by Bay Area artists. \nGood to know: If you’d rather have a cocktail than a glass of wine, swing by the Napa Valley Distillery, where you can taste through a flight of limited release and seasonal craft spirits. \nONE-TANK WONDER \nMonterey: California history \nMonterey is the town where California was born. From the capital of Spanish and Mexican California to the site of California’s first constitutional convention, the significance of the city in state history is often overlooked when the beach beckons in summer. Take advantage of fall to brush up. \nGet there: 118 miles from downtown San Francisco on Highway 101 to Highway 156, and finally to Highway 1. \nDoze: Hacienda- \ninspired Casa Munras in the heart of old-town Monterey includes a spa and Spanish restaurant. 700 Munras Ave.; (831) 375-2411; www.hotelcasamunras.com. Rates start at $165. \nDine: Pay tribute to old Monterey’s Mexican roots by dining at modern Turtle Bay Taqueria. 431 Tyler St.; (831) 333-1500; www.turtlebay.tv. \nDo: Visit Colton Hall, where California’s first Constitution was drafted in October 1849, after Monterey had been the capital of Alta California. \nGood to know: The original adobes and colorful gardens from the Spanish and Mexican eras are scattered amid more modern buildings in Monterey’s historic district. Catch them on the 2-mile “Path of History” walk, marked by yellow tiles set into the sidewalk. \nFARTHER AFIELD \nBear Valley: skiing without lift lines \nAs the days grow shorter, the minds of winter sports fans turn to skiing. While huge Sierra resorts have the acreage and more trails, they also have more lines. Skip them for the intimate feeling of Bear Valley, and you’ll have time to enjoy your après. \nGet there: Drive 178 miles east on Interstate 580 to Highway 4. \nDoze: The rustic Bear Valley Lodge is right in the village, where you can chill out between ski outings. 3 Bear Valley Road; (209) 753-2327; www.bearvalley.com/lodge. Rates start at $139. \nDine: Drop by Creekside Bistro in the lodge for hearty mountain-style cuisine before or after your ski outing. \nDo: Downhill isn’t the only direction. Bear Valley Cross Country & Adventure Company has more than 3,000 acres with 38 cross-country ski trails groomed for both track and skate skiing. \nGood to know: With a total of nine lifts and 75 trails across 1,680 skiable acres and a 1,900-foot vertical drop, Bear Valley Mountain Resort (scheduled to open for the season in late November) is ideal for a relaxed ski weekend with or without the kids.
