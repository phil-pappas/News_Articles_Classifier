Ditto. Unlike a lot of other tourists, surfing (the obvious beach activity) doesn’t appeal to me. I love to watch those who are good at the sport glide effortlessly across the surf break, but when I try to achieve the same grace on the board, it eludes me. I am too scared that the board is going to fly up and knock me unconscious, break my nose, or drag me to my death. A little dramatic? Maybe. But that’s how it goes in my head. \nSo what’s a girl to do? Paddle board! Considerably easier than surfing but still great exercise, this activity is perfect for a full-body workout and a water adventure. \nThe sport has picked up popularity in beach towns around the world, with professional competitions and sponsorships held regularly. But the best thing about it? It’s easy to learn! \nEssentially, you’re standing up on a long board with a paddle in hand. Once you get yourself past the waves (an instructor can help with this), you’re free to paddle out to sea, building arm, core and leg strength along the way. Here in Sayulita, Mexico, people have even reported seeing whales once they paddled far enough from the beach. A little scary? Sure. But also magnificent! \nAdditional tips : \n1. It’s always a good idea to consult a professional when trying out a new sport. Get a little lesson on the beach before charging into the water to avoid injury. \n2. Make sure to stretch ! It’s easy to pull a muscle if you’re not used to using it. \n3. Start slow . If you’re out of shape, stay close to the beach rather than paddling out to sea on the first go. Remember, you’ll have to turn around at some point and paddle back in, so proceed with caution. \n4. Wear a secure bikini . You might fall the first few tries, and you want to make sure you’re covered up when you climb back on the board. Avoid string bikinis if you own one, since these fall off most easily. \n5. If you’re concerned about the security of your top, wear a rash guard . You should be able to rent one with the board. \n6. Double up on sunscreen . Sun reflecting off the ocean’s surface is stronger than the rays you soak up on the beach. \n7. Most importantly, observe weather conditions before you paddle out – if it’s windy or if the waves are huge, it’s probably not the best day for your first paddle board experience. \n8. Have fun ! Have you ever tried paddle boarding? Would you?
