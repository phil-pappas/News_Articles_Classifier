Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Others say the landmark focuses too much on the battle that eventually gave way to Texas independence and not enough on its role as a cultural and commercial gateway. \n“We’ve overly focused on March 6, 1836,” said Jesus F. de la Teja, director of the Center for the Study of the Southwest at Texas State University. \nSome critics say the Alamo could learn from nearby attractions and offer catchier exhibits and displays. \n“History in and of itself will not sell,” said Davis Phillips, president and CEO of Phillips Entertainment. “History, presented in the right way, can sell.” \nPhillips owns three Alamo Plaza attractions including Ripley’s and Guinness World Records Museum. The Texas General Land Office is moving to acquire the buildings housing those businesses across from the Alamo and possibly incorporate them into the mission’s original footprint. \nState lawmakers have approved spending $31 million for repurposing the site. San Antonio officials have approved spending $17 million. But both state and city officials say private donations could raise the tally by hundreds of millions of dollars. \nPhillips said neighboring family entertainment attractions that complement the Alamo experience should be included in the vision behind the changes. He said most visitors only spend a short time at the mission before heading to nearby businesses. \n“There’s been 170 years of development in the area,” he said. \nThe Daughters of the Republic of Texas managed the Alamo grounds for more than a century before the state took over the operations earlier this year. The Daughters of the Republic still maintains a research center there that includes a 38,000-item archival collection considered one of the most important in the state. \nDaughters of the Republic president general Betty Edwards said any Alamo-related changes must be done with “reverence and respect” given its history as a burial site for Native Americans and the place where the bodies of the defenders of 1836 were piled and burned by Santa Anna’s troops. \nDe la Teja said the Alamo has been turned into a “living ruin” that doesn’t capture the dynamic rise of the area in which many cultures built an important commercial hub over time. \n“San Antonio grew up around it, so let’s tell that story,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:51:47.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
