There have only been three days when the vessel has not sailed due to engine issues.\n– Houlder Ltd The company did find the ship experienced occassional 'roll motions', caused by large waves, which can affect customer comfort.\nCondor has said it welcomes the findings and is determined to making the recommended improvements.\nWhilst these don’t affect the ship’s safety, we know they are disconcerting to customers, and so we’ll be doing all we can to minimise the likelihood of them occurring as well as improving communications on board when they do occur.\n– Captain Fran Collins, Condor Ferries Travel Guernsey Jersey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:24:05.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
