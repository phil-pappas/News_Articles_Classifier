The Romanian airline Blue Air is launching a new service between Hamburg and Bucharest on 29 March, 2016. There will then be two flights per week, on Tuesday and Friday, from Hamburg to the Romanian capital.\nThe service represents two premieres at once for Hamburg Airport. First, Blue Air is a brand new airline for Hamburg. Second, this is another new eastern European destination for the airport’s route network.\n“We very much welcome Blue Air’s commitment to Hamburg Airport,” says Michael Eggenschwiler, CEO of Hamburg Airport. “The new route offers enormous potential. Bucharest was number 1 on our wishlist of European destinations for a reason. I am very pleased that we can now close this gap and increase the variety of our route network.”\nBlue Air will be flying modern Boeing 737 aircraft on the route, bringing passengers from Hamburg to the Romanian capital in less than three hours. Fares start at €32.90* one way (including taxes, limited availability).\nSource:- Hamburg Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:32:52.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
