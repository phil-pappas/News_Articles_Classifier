This will be Inntopia’s debut at two of the industry’s premier attractions and outdoor entertainment trade shows and conferences. \n\"Everything we have developed over 15 years to make Inntopia the leading online booking and call-center application for the winter resort business is applicable to theme parks and water parks. Bundling products such as tickets, lodging, and third-party activities is a great way to increase business and offer one-stop shopping to their busy consumers. This is a natural move for Inntopia,\" says Marc Bujold, VP Sales at Inntopia. \nIn October of 2013, Inntopia signed its first water park partner, Splash Lagoon, an indoor water park and family vacation resort with three connected hotels. More recently, Colonial Williamsburg, one of the nation’s most dynamic hospitality enterprises also partnered up with Inntopia. “This partnership will enable Colonial Williamsburg to provide a single platform for our online guests,” said Joe Cawley, Colonial Williamsburg’s vice president of Information Technology. “We wanted a reservation system that offered the capacity to combine our varied accommodation choices with the wide array of activities, events, recreation, dining, and shopping opportunities. Inntopia has provided an intuitive yet robust system that will allow our guests to go online and book their complete Colonial Williamsburg experience.” \nAccording to data collected in 2011, nearly 30,000 attractions (theme and amusement parks, attractions, water parks, family entertainment centers, zoos, aquariums, science centers, museums and resorts) produced a total nationwide economic impact of $219 billion in 2011. The attractions parks in the United States are visited by some 375 million guests annually, and 27% of American families reported staying overnight. \nPartnering with attraction resorts is a catalyst for movement into new vertical markets for Inntopia. Multiple areas of development, such as the possibility to interface with OmniTicket, one of the most widely used POS systems in the attractions industry world-wide will revolutionize the market as we know it. “We are very excited about this new opportunity,” stated Trevor Crist, Founder and CEO of Inntopia. “We can definitely help future partners deliver their guests a complete vacation experience.” \nInntopia provides the leading suite of advanced reservation solutions in the destination industry, with a continuously evolving platform, using over 15 years of measurable results and feedback from industry leading partners.
