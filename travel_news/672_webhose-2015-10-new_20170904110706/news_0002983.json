The Evana solution will improve part reliability and cycle time, while increasing operator efficiency and ergonomics.\nThe dual press assembly cell is a semi-automatic solution that presses a printed circuit board (PCB) onto a header pin at one station and presses the printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) onto a coil and switch pad at the other station. At press station number one, the operator manually loads the header pin into the part nest. Next, the operator places the PCBA into the part nest and activates the system via a finger switch. Upon activation, the vision camera verifies that the correct parts are in place (via bar codes). If everything is correct, the parts are pressed together and force data is collected. From there, another vision camera verifies header pin height. If all is correct, the PCBA subassembly is released to the operator.\nAt press station number two, the operator manually loads the PCBA subassembly into a dead part nest. Next, the operator places a coil into a live part nest and then places a switch pad over the coil before activating the system via a finger switch. Upon activation, the vision camera verifies that the correct parts are in place (via bar codes). If everything is correct, the system alerts the operator to remove the PCBA subassembly from the dead nest and place it into the live part nest with the coil and switch pad. The operator activates the system once again, via finger switch, to verify that all the parts are correctly in place. If everything is correct, the parts are pressed together and force data is collected. From there, another vision camera verifies correct part orientation. If everything is correct, the operator removes completed PCBA and puts it aside.\nThe cycle time for each pressing operation is 12.5 seconds, which includes manual loading and unloading.\n\"The Evana dual press assembly cell adds production capacity and saves floor space,\" said Randy Wire , general manager of Evana Automation Specialists. \"Most importantly, it improves operator efficiency and part reliability.\"\nEvana, a subsidiary of Phillips Service Industries (PSI) , utilizes diverse technologies to specialize in motion control, robotics integration, welding integration and system architecture by linking production equipment, material handling systems, data collection, networking, as well as computer software and hardware into flexible, unified technology.
