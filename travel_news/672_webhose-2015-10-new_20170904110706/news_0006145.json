On Saturday, Stuart Lancaster’s team face the nightmarish scenario of dealing with the “Pooper” combination of Michael Hooper and David Pocock. In England’s most recent defeats to the New Zealand, South Africa and Australia, the man of the match award went to the player with a No 7 on his back in the form of Richie McCaw, Schalk Burger and Hooper. Now the latter has a partner in crime, a Ronnie to his Reggie. Together they are fast proving an irresistible combination specialising in grand larceny. David Pocock and Michael Hooper are both natural No 7s It was Pocock and Hooper who were largely responsible for inflicting the All Blacks’ only defeat this year in Australia’s 27-19 victory in Sydney that also secured the Rugby Championship title. For once it was Richie McCaw was left chasing shadows at the breakdown. Hooper got the man of the match award in their maiden outing as a starting pair. Next time out, the sponsors’ champagne went to Pocock who won five turnovers singlehandedly in the 28-13 victory against Fiji . The England pack, by contrast, have collectively won six turnovers in two matches. Still, it took a considerable leap of faith for Michael Cheika, the Australia head coach, to start them together. Conventional wisdom suggests there is only room for a single fetcher in a side. With Pocock moving to No 8, Australia lose a lineout jumper and a degree of ballast at the base of the scrum. “There was a great deal of nervousness amongst many people, including the selectors, around picking them together, particularly with the lineout opportunities,” Rod Kafer, the former Australia centre and television analyst. “Their selection was almost demanded by their force of will.” Cheika confirmed their form in Super Rugby – Pocock for the Brumbies and Hooper for the Waratahs who he coached last season – left him little choice. “I’d probably be a bit more traditionalist in the way I set up the back row with a different type of blindside flanker but the two lads have played too well so far for me not to select them together,” Cheika said. “Just because I might have certain ideas, I should be open to change on that front. They should complement each other both in character and play and I feel that’s the case with these two guys and it makes me feel comfortable to select them.” England vs Australia Pool A game kicks off in: What makes them so effective is how they dovetail on the field. Both are outstanding over the ball and in defence, yet there are important differences too. Hooper is very much a linking seven, often acting as an auxiliary centre, while Pocock has no peer in his strength over the ball. Kafer’s analysis of their performances in Super Rugby last season bears this out. “Over 90 per cent of David Pocock’s activity occurred within one pass of the scrum-half,” Kafer said. “He would be making 50-60 runs and 55 would be off the scrum-half. Conversely with Hooper only 20 per cent of his runs were within one pass of the scrum-half and 40 per cent of his runs were within two passes of the scrum-half. That shows how they operate in completely different channels. “Defensively, they feed off each other. By the nature of the way they play, they are in close proximity to each other but you haven’t seen them treading on each other’s toes. They hunt as a pair. One will make the tackle and the other will compete over the ball. It is the dynamic duo.” Who is Batman and Robin in that partnership is open to question. Neither seems too fussed to take the starring role. “Mike’s a world-class player and I really enjoy playing alongside him; it’s been a new challenge but something I’ve enjoyed,” Pocock said. It would seem they are a complimentary as well as complementary pair. “I have loved watching Dave do some of his work, he was outstanding against Fiji,” Hooper said. “I have had a little laugh when we have ended up in the same ruck going for the same ball, but we are doing our job when we are doing that and it has been pretty effective. It’s very natural how we’re dovetailing in there. It is a work in progress and that is really cool.” Together, Hooper and Pocock concede 21kgs in weight to opposite numbers Chris Robshaw and Ben Morgan. If it was purely based on an arm wrestle then England would win. The jackals, though, will be hunting for any weakness at the breakdown that can lead to a penalty or turnover with which to feed the ravenous Wallaby back division. Low centres of gravity are a distinct advantage in that regard, a trait that has been valued by Australia going back to the 2003 World Cup. “I think my generation and generations to come of players in Australia have a lot to owe to Phil Waugh and George Smith, I think they really broke the mould in that regard,” Pocock said. “I think they really proved just how successful a short back-rower can be. Compared to most of the forwards I would say I’m small, yeah. “The coach is not going to put me at No 8 and expect me to carry over some of the big guys we’re going to come up against at the tournament. So he wants you to use your skills, and he’s been empowering us with that ever since he’s been in the job.” So how do you stop Pocock and Hooper, a task that proved beyond the All Blacks? Advice comes from an unlikely source in Joe Marler antagonist Bob Dwyer, the coach of 1991 World Cup Wallabies. “If I was England, I would be saying if we support our ball carrier accurately then there will not be any chance of them pilfering the ball.” That strategy is confirmed by John Connolly, another former Wallaby coach. “You cannot go too wide too quickly because they will be exposed at the breakdown,” Connolly said. “It is like when you play New Zealand with McCaw in the team, you have to adapt. You have got to be very accurate with how you play the game. The support cannot arrive a second late.” What is for sure is that England’s already significant trouble at the breakdown is set to double on Saturday.
