The system allowed the hotel to track energy, carbon and water usage, and simultaneously measure the performance of waste management. With the implementation of the system, the hotel has been able to choose from over 200 activities designed to reduce energy and water usage, leading to an improved carbon footprint. \nAs a green-design hotel, other green aspects include a spacious landscaped rooftop which houses a 24-hour fitness room and swimming pool as well as floor-to-ceiling windows in all guestrooms for natural light. The hotel’s interior design also allows for natural air ventilation into the building, thus encouraging lower energy consumption. \nAs an IHG Green Engage participating hotel, guests will not only be able to enjoy the green initiatives at the hotel, but also play a part in worldwide efforts to protect the environment.
