The Caravan, Camping and Touring Supershow, which attracts around 70,000 people and 300 exhibitors, will return for its 38th year while Australia’s most popular German festival, Oktoberfest, will celebrate their ninth and tenth years at the showgrounds after re-signing until 2017.. \nThe festival, which continues this coming weekend, welcomes 40,000 lederhosen and dirndl clad guests to the showgrounds over two fun filled weekends. St Jerome’s Laneway Festival, the Illumi Fun Run, the Model Train Expo, Red Boot Hoot and Your Local Wedding Guide Bridal Expo are among a long list of events returning to the Royal International Convention Centre (Royal ICC) and Brisbane Showgrounds in 2016. RNA Chief Executive Brendan Christou said it was a testament to the Royal ICC and Brisbane Showgrounds staff that the venues were attracting so much repeat business. “Our first priority is to deliver excellence in customer service and we consistently receive great feedback from clients,’’ he said. “We have a state-of-the-art convention centre along with Queensland’s largest indoor/ outdoor events venue and a new Rydges hotel opening onsite in 2016. “It’s no surprise we are filling our 2016 and 2017 calendars with returning clients.” The 22 hectare Brisbane Showgrounds precinct is home to the Royal ICC and located just 1.5km from Brisbane’s CBD. In 2016 the precinct will welcome the new four star Rydges hotel which will provide accommodation for Royal ICC guests.
