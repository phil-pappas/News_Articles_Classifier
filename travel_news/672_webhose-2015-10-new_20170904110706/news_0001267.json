It’s exactly these stories that Design Hotels holds near and dear, especially when they are layered with innovative and thoughtful design.\nThe Old Clare Hotel, Sydney, Australia\nWhen the founder and owner of Unlisted Collection Loh Lik Peng came upon the Carlton United Brewery and the former iconic Clare pub at the top of Chippendale’s Kensington Street in 2011, it was both love at first site and the beginning of a puzzling project. Opened in September 2015 after four years of redevelopment, The Old Clare Hotel’s two heritage-listed buildings have been adjoined by a glass atrium under the engineered expertise of Tonkin Zulaikha Greer Architects. The result: a distinctive property with obsessive attention to detail and a focus on retaining as many original features as possible. Traces of the past remain in all 62 rooms and suites, with high ceilings, large windows, timber paneling and exposed walls.\nFactory Hotel, Münster, Germany\nHoused in the old Bermania Brewery, the Factory Hotel reveals a surprising and sucessful combination of old and new. The landmarked building sits overlooking Lake Aasee, surrounded by a lively mix of shops, restaurants, and clubs. The modern wing, created by Andreas Deilmann, houses the hotel’s 144 rooms, marrying the old bones of concrete, wood, and felt with the contemporary cues of sleek furniture and statement lighting. Guests looking to work off the excesses of the hotel’s signature brew can enjoy personal training tips, or simply relax at the amazing and expansive 3,500-square-meter fitness center with its swimming pool, spa, and roof terrace.\nQT Sydney, Sydney, Australia\nSet within two of the city’s most iconic buildings – Gowings department store and the State Theatre – QT Sydney revives the rich and colorful history of theatre and retail. In the heart of Sydney’s central business district, this 200-room hotel is surrounded by theatre, fashion, cuisine, and design. Stone cladding, gargoyles, and façade details have been carefully restored, while interior elements such as the restored costume cabinets reference the building’s past. The lobby, linked to the bustling Market Street, invites guests in with a lively buzz, while the luxurious day spa, as well as the restaurant, lounge, and bar, attract stylish locals.\nThe House Hotel Galatasaray, Istanbul, Turkey\nLocated in the bohemian neighborhood of Çukurcuma, where typical Ottoman houses and antique shops abound, The House Hotel Galatasaray is steeped in history, art, and culture. The abandoned 5-story building was carefully renovated by Turkish design studio, Autoban, creating an award-winning combination that fuses yesterday’s Istanbul with the zeitgeist of the modern day capital. The ochre façade and the lobby’s marble staircase remain while wooden parquet, hexagonal ceiling treatments, and ornate wall details thoughtfully blend past and present. Guests looking for an inside track on the latest food, design, and art can follow an expert from the exclusive guiding service, Locally Istanbul.\nSir Albert Hotel, Amsterdam, Netherlands\nNestled in Amsterdam’s bustling De Pijp district, the 90-room Sir Albert Hotel has seen a 19th century diamond factory recut as a modern cultural sanctuary. Keeping this past in mind, Alon Baranowitz and Irene Kronenberg of BK Architecture designed the rooms and suites to capture the northern daylight that was essential to precision diamond cutting. Industrial elements of brick and wood-framed warehouse windows give nostalgic nods to the gemstone past, while an atmosphere and service concept straddles the best of both worlds. A masterful conversion has transformed the property, imparting the sense of a private mansion. Here, guests become ensconced in Sir Albert’s worldly ways: design pieces by Italian manufacturers Maxalto, Moroso, and Ceccotti sit alongside works of standout Dutch designers such as Piet Hein Eek and Joy van Erven.\nCa’ Pisani, Venice, Italy\nThe merchant’s townhouse home to Venice’s Ca’ Pisani hotel is more than 500 years, but a three-year restoration by architects Roberto Luigi Canovaro and Gianluigi Pescolderung breathed new life into the property. As fourth generation Venetian hoteliers, the Serandrei family understands the importance of a continued legacy, and thus ample trademarks of the past remain at Ca’Pisani. Wooden beams and gothic trifora windows reflect the building’s 14th century roots, while the geometric forms gracing the interiors celebrate the Venetian art deco movement of the 20’s and 30’s. Throughout the hotel’s public spaces paintings by Futurist artist Fortunato Depero, unify and amplify the overall melding of eras.\nLa Réserve Paris – Apartments, France\nLocated directly across from the Eiffel Tower, La Réserve Paris’ Haussmannian structure exemplifies 19th century Parisian classicism. Set on Trocadero Place, the name takes its origin from a battle conducted by Napoleon in 1823; the building is defined by a lofty grandeur befitting its royal beginnings. A crisp, monochrome color scheme dominated by white is offset by the natural nobility of rosewood, ebony, stone, and slate. Architect and interior designer Rémi Tessier’s treatment of the ten private apartments embody subdued luxury for guests seeking a pied-à-terre in the French capital.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:43:30.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
