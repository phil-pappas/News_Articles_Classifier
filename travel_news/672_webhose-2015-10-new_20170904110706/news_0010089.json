Rome's central historical area is quite compact, and easily walkable if you're in good shape. Don't try to drive it. Walking along the Tiber river is my \"express lane\" through the city. You can't go wrong and it's a flat walk. \nThe map of Rome below will show you the major tourist destinations. Zoom in or out and move the map around by using the buttons. Map of Rome Showing Tourist Destinations Interactive Map of Rome © 2014 by James Martin, licensed to About \nThis is a very simplified map of Rome that shows only the major tourist attractions and neighborhoods. For a map showing all the rione or central neighborhoods, see: Rome Neighborhood Guide . Rome: Getting Around \nMetro . The map shows the two metro lines. The red line is Metro A (linea A) and the blue is Metro B (linea B). They cross at Rome's central station, Termini. They run from 5:30am to 11:30pm. A ticket costs €1.50 and is good for a single metro ride or 75 minutes on the buses. Tickets for both the bus system and Metro can be purchased from a tabacchi (tobacco shop), or vending machines at metro stations and major bus stops. \nA daily ticket (B.I.G.) is available for €4, (three days for €11) and a weekly ticket (C.I.S.) costs €16 Things to Do in Rome \nRome is known for its Roman Archaeological sites and its museums, especially the Vatican Museums . A short ride out of Rome on a single metro ticket gets you to Ostia Antica , a bargain for a huge Roman site next to an interesting village with a castle. \nWhile there are many free things to do in Rome , the list is dwindling with the tanking of the world economy. You can save some money by purchasing Combination Tickets to many attractions before you go to Italy. Select Italy specializes in event and museum tickets, and is a convenient way to save time over standing in a ticket line while you're trying to enjoy the sites. See: Museum Tickets in Rome (Buy Direct). \nRome is a great walking city. Wandering around the the center city is in itself a major wonder. When you get tired (or hot in the summer), you can see the buried city under Rome . \nIf it's summer and Rome is sweltering, do what the Romans do and head for the Castelli Romani in the Alban hills. A short train ride out of Rome gets you to an area of volcanic lakes with cool summer breezes and nice nighttime temperatures. Even the Pope summers here. Getting to Rome \nThe best way is to get to Rome from other nearby destinations is to take the train to Termini Station. For instructions, see our Airport to Central Rome Transportation article.
