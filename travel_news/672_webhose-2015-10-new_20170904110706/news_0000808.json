(Photo: Getty Images)\n2 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Q: I have flown on a Boeing 757 numerous times, and it always feels like a rocket taking off (not that I have actually been on a rocket). I've heard that the 757 is \"overpowered.\" Have you flown this aircraft? What is your opinion of the 757?\n— Scott, Jacksonville\nA: The 757 is one of my favorite airplanes. The lines are beautiful, and the performance is unmatched by other airliners. It has a higher thrust-to-weight ratio, resulting in spectacular climb performance. I have not had the chance to fly a 757 but have flown the simulator. I was impressed. Sadly, when I retired from the airline, I had not had the chance to fly it, but it would have been next on my list.\nQ: Hey, Captain, I've flown on most commercial types and wanted to know which has the highest power-to-weight ratio? My best guess is the 757-200 with the Pratt and Whitney engines.\n— Alex Amir, Aruba\nA: Your guess is good. A 757-200 with the more powerful engines stands out among its competitors.\nQ: What is the cruising speed of a 757 in miles per hour?\n— Alan, no location given\nA: In still air on a standard day, a 757 will cruise at 80% of the speed of sound (660 mph), or 530 mph.\nQ: It looks like airlines are replacing their 757s with 737-800s and MAXs with comparable seating capacity. Do you know why? From a pilot's perspective, what's the difference? From this passenger's perspective, the 757 feels roomier, quieter and more comfortable, regardless of what seating plan the airlines use.\n— Gerald Shenk, Seaside, Calif.\nA: The 737 burns significantly less fuel than the 757. Additionally, with the variation in the sizes of the 737, the scheduling flexibility for flight crews lowers the costs of operation. The maintenance cost of the 737 is lower because of the commonality of parts between the models. The 757 actually has the same size fuselage as a 737 in circumference.\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\nLoading...\n2 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1S4z1Nq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/30d078477e2619bda9371aa3fe6088d8945c3335/r=500x339/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811921894579918-ThinkstockPhotos-510226511.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1S4z1Nq", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S4z1Nq&text=Ask%20the%20Captain%3A%20Questions%20about%20Boeing%20757&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S4z1Nq&mini=true", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGk3WUFiTTl3VUNWX2d2bXRqVFZoUUE6MQ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/96fb927e0578b7d9a6a9df5d4337ab9dc1390d55/c=185-0-3646-2602&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811921894579918-ThinkstockPhotos-510226511.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811921894579918-ThinkstockPhotos-510226511.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:31:52.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
