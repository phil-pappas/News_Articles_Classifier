Enter if you dare...\n1. 13th Floor, Denver, Colorado Brandy Rae Photography\nThere’s a reason so many buildings avoid adding a 13th floor. Whether haunted or not, the unlucky number tends to scare off even the most practical of people. At Denver’s largest haunted house, a trip through the fabled 13th floor will not only lead to encounters with spirits from the netherworld, but you’ll run into creatures from this world ­­ such as rats, snakes, and spiders. The creepiest creature on the floor is Mr. Heykids, a retired professional clown who, after years of neglect, developed a taste for blood. His laughter can be heard echoing through the halls, mixed with screams of terror.\nPrice: $25.99, group and children’s discount available.\nOpen weekdays through Nov. 1 and weekends through Nov. 14.\nTickets: http://www.13thfloorhauntedhouse.com/\n2.
