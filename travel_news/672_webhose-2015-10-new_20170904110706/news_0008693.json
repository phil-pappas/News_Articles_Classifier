America’s Cup boats have changed to smaller, super-light and hydrofoil-equipped craft in the constant quest to eke out more speed and greater agility. Laminated, heat-moulded sails result from the application of the latest aerodynamic discoveries, and the latest exotic materials are applied towards the ancient sailing tenet that the less that a sail distorts under force, the more power it applies to the boat. Sailing has always mixed the old with the new, and its sponsors reflect that blend of heritage and technology. The classic glamour of international yacht clubs still attracts luxury brands such as Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton and Prada, of course – drawn in by the literally huge branding opportunities afforded by globe-trotting ships with vast sails. Timepieces have a historic association, although they are no longer crucial to navigation. Leading watch brands such as TAG Heuer and Rolex still sponsor high-profile events. Today’s technology is perhaps less beautiful but equally crucial to success. The business consultancy Accenture, for instance, lent its expertise to the Great Britain sailing team 10 years ago, as part of a sponsorship deal with the sport’s governing body, the Royal Yachting Association. Its insights helped identify areas to apply a new performance-management project aimed at maintaining Britain’s position as the world’s No 1 sailing nation. New drones allow teams to cover the sport without the expense of helicopter crews Now technology is also playing an important role in the effort to boost sailing’s reach and increase its worth within the fiercely competitive global sports sponsorship market. New formats such as the Extreme Sailing Series, with its “stadium-type” racing in inshore locations, have transformed viewing figures and engagement. Online, Extreme Sailing passed one million page views four years ago and in 2013 its media value increased by 26pc to €35.1m (£25.9m). Live tracking sites and apps such as Trac Trac also allow sailing fans to track who is chasing whom, and at what speed, giving greater insight into a race that can appear chaotic from the shore. Miriam Torres, a former America’s Cup press officer, recently told Sailing magazine Scuttlebutt that this use of internet technology is one of the biggest “game changers” in her 15 years in the sport. Alongside the new formats, innovation in broadcasting has showcased a host of new approaches, such as the on-board reporter for the Volvo Ocean Race. This crew member is given the task of delivering fly-on-the-wall documentation, bringing fans professional footage, images, Quote: s and stories in real-time. Race organisers said this transformed engagement levels and other sailing competitions, including the Vendée Globe, Extreme 40 and America’s Cup, have followed suit, streaming live broadcasts. Sponsors should take note of the efforts to make sailing reach a wider audience The 2013 America’s Cup went further, by accompanying live footage with its LiveLine graphics, using an Emmy Award-winning technical innovation that plots the position of boats in the race to within centimetres. This technology was first developed for the Nascar motor racing series in the United States, and sailing has proved a successful testbed for a potentially lucrative rolling out of similar technology across other sports. Perhaps most exciting of all, live digital coverage is now readily available thanks to new types of drones allowing organisers and teams to cover the sport without the expense of traditional helicopter crews. Pigeon Vision, for instance, is the brainchild of Justice Bentz, a former crew member of The Maltese Falcon, the largest sailboat in the world. The system uses drones to picture and track races and regattas, and the Florida-based company has achieved nearly 2.5 million views in less than two years. Sponsors should take note of the efforts to make sailing reach a wider audience. In July, the America’s Cup World Series in Portsmouth attracted nearly 250,000 spectators, with more people watching the first race of the latest series than all the previous America’s Cups combined. Technology is a game changer Watching live sport can be highly emotional, and the challenge for those marketing it is to deliver that ultimate fan experience to a global fan base. Technical innovation is helping to deliver that, be it a football club using a second screen on match days, an augmented-reality app for F1 coverage or data-driven gamification of NFL matches. Big ideas delivered through new technology keep the fans happy and open new revenue streams for merchandise, hospitality and associated spend. Sports fans now have many local and global entertainment options available via a variety of media outlets, hence they are empowered, extremely mobile and demanding. Therefore, sports organisations must understand the technical landscape and use the latest innovations to develop interactive, experiences that engage fans and drive better business results. – Paul Diamond Business director, Realise Read more: • Win 2016 Ryder Cup tickets • The ones to watch at The 2016 Ryder Cup • The five best-funded Olympic sports • Can American football crack the UK market? • England’s Ashes win is a dream for sponsors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:18:37.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
