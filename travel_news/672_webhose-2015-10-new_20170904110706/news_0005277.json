And too much rugby , says Wales’ record try-scorer, with 58, is the biggest factor that leads to fatigue and diminishes performances. “You have to separate yourself from rugby as much as you possibly can,” says Williams, 38, who retired from international rugby in 2011. “Try and forget about the game for five minutes because when people are talking about it the whole time it can drive you nuts. The short turnarounds can be a killer. But the best coaches listen to their players. There is no point training a team who are fatigued “Go sightseeing, dive into the local culture, just do something different which takes your mind off the tournament, and get out of your room, which can seem prison-like and give you cabin fever – that is key.” Williams says that rest is also vitally important. “As it is a tournament over a short period of time your body does get tired,” he says. “The short turnarounds can be a killer. But the best coaches listen to their players. There is no point training a team who are fatigued.” And to ease the mental tiredness? “Don’t read the papers, watch the news or worry about what people are saying,” Williams says. “Go and enjoy yourself, because if you are worried about what’s happening off the field too it will harm your rugby.” How to stay motivated Personal trainer Luke Sumner-Wilson ( lswhealth.com ) shares his advice: 1. Set yourself goals “This gives you a sense of purpose, a timescale and deadline so if you do fall off the wagon, you’ll be more motivated to get back on.” 2. Document your progress “Keep a record and use it as a reference when you need reminding about what you can achieve. Take progress pictures if goals are based on aesthetics.” 3. Don’t overcommit “Be realistic about your time. Too demanding a schedule can lead to missing sessions, feeling guilty and demotivated.” • For more information on health and lifestyle, visit vitality.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:36:28.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
