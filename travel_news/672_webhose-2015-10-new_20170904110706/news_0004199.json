Why not consider at trip abroad?\nWhile it’s a peak time for travel within the U.S., it can be a slow period for travel overseas. There are some great fares for international travel. Thanksgiving is not a holiday that is celebrated abroad, so there aren’t as many people traveling as there are for Christmas and New Year’s.\nFor example, if you want to head to Europe during the Christmas break, you’ll have both Americans and Europeans traveling. That means more competition for airline seats, and that results in higher fares.\nWe looked at weeklong trips over the Thanksgiving holiday, departing Nov. 25 and returning Dec. 2. Round-trip fares from Dallas to Europe were as low as $736 to Dublin, $802 to Istanbul, $870 to Brussels, $906 to Barcelona or Lisbon and $926 to Rome. If you want a sun-and-fun trip, destinations in Central America and the Caribbean were less than $400 round trip.\nSample round-trip fares for travel Nov. 25 to Dec. 2 from Dallas started at $317 to Belize City, $349 to San Juan, $367 to San Jose, Costa Rica, and $349 to Panama City.\nEven though it’s part of the U.S., we also looked at fares to Hawaii on the same dates and found the prices were $734 to Honolulu or Kauai, $750 to Kona and $753 to Maui.\nWe also looked at these destinations for Christmas travel, from Dec. 23 to Dec. 30, and fares were much higher. Round-trip fares from Dallas started at $1,209 to Dublin, $1,119 to Istanbul, $1,289 to Brussels, $1,207 to Lisbon, $1,263 to Barcelona and $1,504 to Rome. The Central America and Caribbean fares were $624 to San Juan, $755 to Belize City, $857 to San Jose and $726 to Panama City, and Hawaii fares were $973 to Honolulu, $1,025 to Maui, $1,045 to Kauai and $1,093 to Kona.\nFor Asia or the South Pacific, sample prices from Dallas for travel departing Nov. 25 and returning Dec. 2 were $619 to Taipei, $836 to Ho Chi Minh City, $943 to Bangkok, $1,029 to Hong Kong, $1,055 to Tokyo, $1,419 to Sydney, $1,356 to Auckland and $1,538 to Melbourne. By comparison, fares for travel from Dallas Dec. 23-30 were $1,438 to Taipei, $1,407 to Ho Chi Minh City, $1,694 to Bangkok, $1,650 to Hong Kong, $1,798 to Tokyo, $2,261 to Sydney, $2,284 to Auckland and $2,438 to Melbourne. The Christmas fare to Taipei was more than double the price, and the South Pacific fares were $770 to $928 more expensive than the Thanksgiving fares.\nWe looked at flights to South America and sample prices from Dallas for travel departing Nov. 25 and returning Dec. 2 were $739 to Quito, $655 to Lima, $761 to São Paulo, $838 to Santiago and $1,290 to Buenos Aires. Prices for travel Dec. 23-30 started at $864 to Quito, $940 to Lima, $1,059 to São Paulo, $1,381 to Santiago and $1,538 to Buenos Aires.\nMany of the Thanksgiving fares were similar to the fares we looked at for fall off-peak dates. Travel during Thanksgiving can be much cheaper than travel during Christmas. And if you’re buying tickets for several people, that savings can really add up.\nThis year, save on an international vacation by bucking tradition and skipping the turkey. The fares listed above were valid at press time, but are subject to change. Remember, when you find a good fare, book it, because it may not last.\nTom Parsons is the editor of bestfares.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:31:58.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
