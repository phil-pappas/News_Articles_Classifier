And the low fares may continue until the end of the year. \nThe average domestic airfare for September was 18% lower than during the same time last year, and 9% lower than in August, according to a study by the travel site Hopper.com. \nFor the next three months, average fare prices are projected to be 17% cheaper than in the same period in 2014, the study projects. The most likely reason for the price drop is that fuel prices have sunk 47% since last year, enabling airlines to cut fares and still make a comfortable profit margin, the study said. \n\"Historically, oil prices have contributed relatively few changes in airfare, but over the past year its influence has grown,\" the study said. \nSome critics have demanded that airlines drop fares by the same rate that fuel costs had declined. \nBut Vaughn Jennings, a spokesman for the trade group Airlines for America, said the savings on lower fuel costs are going toward other areas of the industry that have been neglected over the last few years. \n\"Airlines continue to invest in new products and planes, pay down debt, reward employees and investors,\" he said. New way to pack in passengers \nThe airline trend of packing as many passengers per plane as possible may reach a new height. \nThe European aircraft manufacturer Airbus Group has applied for a patent on a seat configuration that adds a row of passengers on top of passengers in seats on the floor of the cabin, similar to bunk beds. \nThe patent proposes \"an elevated deck structure on a main deck floor in the passenger cabin of a widebody aircraft for providing a mezzanine seating area in a substantially under-used upper lobe of the aircraft fuselage,\" according to a filing with the European Patent Office late last month. \nThe \"under-used upper lobe\" area is also known as the space above your head in an airplane cabin. Passengers would climb to the upper seats with steps installed between the ground-floor seats. \nDon't panic, says Airbus. Just because the company applied for a patent doesn't mean it will build the idea. \n\"Airbus Group and its divisions apply for hundreds of patents every year in order to protect intellectual property,\" the company said. \"The vast majority of items and processes patented never become fully realized technology or products.\" \nâ€” Los Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:03:10.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
