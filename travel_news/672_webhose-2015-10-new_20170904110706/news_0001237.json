Turnover at large fleets is at its lowest point since the second quarter of 2011 and below the 2014 average of 95%.\nLast week, ATA released a report pegging the driver shortage at 48,000 by the end of this year .\n\"America's trucking industry moves nearly 70% of the country's freight and we need drivers to do it,\" Costello said. \"While turnover is not at historic highs, it is still high enough to merit concern. Fleets need to hire 89,000 a drivers a year to keep pace with retirements and projected growth, so ensuring an adequate pool of qualified drivers is critical.\"\nAmerican Trucking Associations is the largest national trade association for the trucking industry. Through a federation of 50 affiliated state trucking associations and industry-related conferences and councils, ATA is the voice of the industry America depends on most to move our nation's freight.
