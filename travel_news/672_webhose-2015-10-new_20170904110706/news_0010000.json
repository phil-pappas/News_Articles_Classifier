Our resource is the sea and the future of Rapa Nui is the sea,” he said.\nChile hosted “Our Ocean” in the picturesque Pacific port city of Valparaíso, a second annual day-long get-together for states and foundations to pledge support for the marine ecosystem.\nU.S. President Barack Obama addressed the meeting in a video message to announce two new U.S. National Marine Sanctuaries:\nAn 875-square-mile (2,300-square-kilometer) area of Lake Michigan in Wisconsin that holds dozens of historic wrecks will be protected, U.S. officials said.\nMallows Bay on the Potomac River in Maryland, a tidal wetland and a graveyard for scuttled warships since the Revolutionary War, will also become a reserve.\n“And, in the coming months, I will look for even more opportunities to protect our waters,” Obama said.\n“We will leave our children a planet as full of possibilities as the one we inherited.”\nSeveral more countries and foundations pledged funds and proposed initiatives to fight pollution, overfishing and the acidification of the ocean by carbon emissions.\nLast year’s conference in Washington saw $800 million pledged to support various environmental initiatives and this year’s host Chile hoped for similar success.\nBut perhaps the initiative with the most long-term potential is a U.S. plan to regulate the world fish trade. According to a 2014 study by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, 29 percent of the world’s fish stocks which have been adequately studied are overexploited.\nRegulation and quota systems vary wildly around the world and some countries -– particularly in Southeast Asia -– have been accused of allowing large-scale unregulated fishing.\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, and English businessman Richard Branson at the “Our Ocean” meeting in Viña del Mar, Chile, on Oct. 5, 2015. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet opened the conference by announcing a pledge to create huge new marine reserves around Easter Island in the Pacific.\nMartin Bernetti/AFP\nSea Scout and targeting ‘hot spots’ Part of the U.S. plan, dubbed Sea Scout , will seek to unite governments around the world in the fight to identify illegal fishing vessels and fleets and bar them from landing catches. Under the plan, experts will identify regional fishing “hot spots” and target them for enforcement by member states’ fisheries protection teams, the White House said.\nThe U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration will track suspicious fishing boats by satellite and alert authorities in Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries.\nMeanwhile, Washington will make its own fishing industry and importers serving its huge market –- U.S. consumers eat 4.6 billion pounds of seafood per year -– track products from their origin.\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in Chile to present the U.S. plan, and took the time to talk to a group of students about the challenge of allying technology and law enforcement.\n“The problem is there are people fishing illegally, unregulated, vast areas of the ocean where people use fishing methods that have been prohibited,” he said.\nKerry said governments need “the technology, the armed forces of countries, the navies, coast guard; we need police and major commitment by countries to come together to focus on enforcement.”\nThe conference will also take on the problem of pollution from the land — such as agricultural pesticide and fertilizer run-off and waste plastics — hurting the sea.", "external_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/obama-announces-new-marine-sanctuaries-a-first-in-15-years/", "http://theconversation.com/why-isolated-easter-island-is-the-perfect-spot-for-a-marine-reserve-48424", "http://municipalidaddeisladepascua.cl/?q=node/14", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/05/us-chile-environment-oceans-idUSKCN0RZ1H820151005", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/6UDXsv_BLpI?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:41:55.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
