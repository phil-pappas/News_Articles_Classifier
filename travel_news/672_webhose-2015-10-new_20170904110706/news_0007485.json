Firelands Winery Fullscreen Like this topic? You may also like these photo galleries: Replay Autoplay Show Thumbnails Show Captions Last Slide Next Slide In the past few years, the Ohio wine industry has boomed. According to Christy Eckstein, executive director of the Ohio Grape Industries Committee, the number of licensed wine manufacturers in the state has increased from around 95 in 2007 to more than 230 today.\nOhio has seen growth in wine and grape production across the entire state, even with its diverse climate from north to south and east to west. The state is home to six geographical regions with proximity to lakes and elevation changes splitting some of these areas into smaller micro-regions.\n\"The Ohio climate is really diverse,\" Eckstein explains. \"Reds tend to have more success in Southern Ohio due to the warmer weather allowing the grapes to hang longer and ripen more. Pinot grigio and chardonnay thrive up north in the cool climate. French-American hybrids grow well in the Appalachian and central Ohio wine regions.\"\n\"Drinking wine in Ohio is great for people who are ready to explore different wines,\" adds Donniella Winchell, executive director of the Ohio Wine Producers Association. \"When you enter the state, every winery causes visitors to go, 'Wow this is new'. It's a journey for an exploration for an adventurous palate.\"\nIf you find yourself anywhere in Ohio, these wineries are a great place to start.\nNORTH\nKlingshirn Winery\nThis third-generation winery was established by accident in 1935. First generation owner Albert Klingshirn had an unusually large grape crop that year, and he used it to produce wine in 50-gallon barrels in his basement. Within five years, Albert built a two-story winery. Today, Lee Kingshirn is the third-generation operator of the winery. Located about a mile and a half from the shores of Lake Erie, Kingshirn’s vineyards provide chardonnay, pinot grigio, Vidal blanc, reisling, Concord, Delaware, cabernet sauvignon and chambourcin. Sample wines in the retail room and pick up a few bottles to take with you.\nFirelands Winery\nThis storied winery is steeped in Ohio history. Wine has been made at the Firelands Winery since 1880. It produces wines from the Isle of St. George, which boasts a 200-day frost-free growing season thanks to the warm lake water that heats the surrounding air after cooler temperatures set in. Ownership of the winery has changed hands a few times since then, but elements of the past remain, including the original wine cellar. Claudio Salvador is the current winemaker at Firelands, which boasts nationally-acclaimed wines. Try the award-winning, medium-bodied Firelands Gewurztrminer or the locally-grown cabernet sauvignon.\nPaper Moon\nSituated just two miles from the shores of Lake Erie, Paper Moon Vineyards benefits from growing conditions created by the lake. In May 2008, more than 4,000 vines were planted on a portion of the 50-acre property. Within the next few years, the vines will fully mature for use in hybrids like Vidal blanc, Traminette, Noiret, Marquette and Chambourcin. Paper Moon offers a beautiful tasting room and property for visitors to enjoy while sipping on signature wines like the dry Sailor’s Red, sweet Harvest Blend red and the Silver Lining Dry Reisling.\nCENTRAL\nHidden Lakes Winery\nWith gorgeous views and award-winning wines, this is the perfect place to enjoy an afternoon. Hidden Lakes Winery is located on a serene six-acre property. A two-story deck offers outdoor seating when the weather is right or you can cozy up next to a fire inside when the weather turns colder. Try the Harvest Gold to sample Ohio Niagara grapes, or the sweet Early Frost blend featuring the regional Catawba variety.\nSOUTH\nTerra Cotta Vineyards\nTerra Cotta Vineyards is one of the best — if not the best — Ohio wineries for sampling Chambourcin. Winchell echoes that the winemaker “makes the nicest Chambourcin in the Midwest, possibly in the country.” Food and wine events take place at Terra Cotta Vineyards year-round. Check the schedule to find a chef’s dinner in the vineyard or a cookout with steak, pork tenderloin or salmon with wine pairings. Events at the vineyard tend to sell out fast, so book your spot before your trip.\nMeranda-Nixon Winery\nSince 2007, Meranda-Nixon Winery has been operating in the area of Ohio that was one of the largest growing regions in the country in the 1800s. Eleven acres of vines on the property produce Traminette, cabernet Franc, cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, Norton and Catawba.
