Professor Pearcy said the Congress is expected to provide a lasting legacy of new and enhanced collaborations for a truly international biomechanics community.\nProfessor Pearcy said they anticipate strong student involvement in the Congress, particularly from the Asia Pacific region, along with other delegates travelling from the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, South Africa and Brazil.\nThe scientific program will cover all aspects of biomechanics ranging from cell and tissue biomechanics and modelling of how the tissues respond to loading to motor control, electrophysiology and wearable technologies for human and animal movement.\nThe BCEC Team prepared and led the bid which was presented to the International Executive Council in Boston. Brisbane won the right to host the meeting against strong competition from six competing international cities including San Diego, Calgary and Copenhagen.\nBCEC General Manager, Bob O’Keeffe, said the recent spate of bid wins provided a great opportunity to showcase both the Centre and the City’s ability to host world class scientific events and build on the success and reputation of the G20 Leaders Summit.\n“These latest major wins reinforce the importance of a strong united approach by the city’s stakeholders in attracting meetings involving key sector strengths.”\nBrisbane Marketing General Manager, Conventions and Business Events, Rob Nelson said these bid wins once again reinforced the city’s reputation as a health and life sciences innovation and research hub.\n“The Brisbane Convention Bureau is delighted to work together with BCEC, TEQ, our city partners and our institutions to help pull together bid proposals that ensure hosts and delegates have unparalleled conference experiences here in Brisbane,” he said.\nBrisbane’s bid to host the XXVI Congress of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) 2017 combining with the Asian-Pacific Association for Biomechanics Conference (APAB) is supported by the Queensland Government, through Tourism and Events Queensland as part of its commitment to grow overnight visitor expenditure and showcase Brisbane as a leading business, study and leisure destination.\nSource:- Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:24:32.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
