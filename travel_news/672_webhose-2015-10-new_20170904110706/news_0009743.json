The Company defines economic fuel expense as raw fuel expense plus (gains)/losses realized through actual cash payments to/(receipts from) hedge counterparties for fuel hedge derivatives settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis investor update contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views with respect to certain current and future events and financial performance including but not limited to statements regarding the Company's operating revenue per available seat mile, cost per available seat mile excluding fuel, available seat miles, gallons of jet fuel consumed and economic fuel cost per gallon, each for the quarter ending September 30 , 2015.
