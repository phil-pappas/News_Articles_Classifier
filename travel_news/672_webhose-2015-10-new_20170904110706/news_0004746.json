Huge skies draw your eyes across the Loughor estuary to Burryport and eastwards towards the village of Crofty, a distant pinprick on the horizon. But the coast and saltmarsh as we see them today have changed dramatically since the 1960s, when dredging in the Loughor estuary was halted. “The saltmarsh was always here,” says Sian Musgrave, the National Trust’s head warden at Gower. “But the dredging affected the currents going around the silt in the water. But when the dredging was scaled down the saltmarsh began to accrue.\" • UK coastal walks: along the Gower peninsula Today, a medieval sea wall is the bulwark that keeps the saltmarsh at bay, separating fresh water from sea, with a sluice allowing fresh water to flow out. Behind the sea wall the freshwater pasture is grazed by native breeds, such as Welsh Black sheep, and Hereford and Galloway cattle. Cwm Ivy tor would once have been a high sea cliff but now, thanks to the wall, it is surrounded by drained land. “You can often hear birds but not see them [on the salt marsh.] The tide can creep in and all of sudden it's lapping over the top. It is a magical place to come at dawn or dusk.” Sian Musgrave, the National Trust’s head warden at Gower As you walk along you can’t help noticing that the sea is in the process of shifting the rhino-horn snout of Whiteford sands, changing its shape amid a stirring mobile dune system that has seen a new dune slack established in just 15 years and has, in turn, quickly attracted orchids and nesting lapwings. It’s a place where there seems to be no dividing between land and sea. In the future – perhaps just 1,000-2,000 years - it’s possible that a freshwater lagoon may form and that the saltmarsh shifts its position once again. The western side of the Whiteford burrows are worth exploring, where you come across dinner-plate sized blocks of silt and peat. They look like giant Jaffa cakes and are the residue of a 17th century tsunami that surged up the River Severn, churning up the peaty land on its way. Whiteford is a National Nature Reserve Photo: Alamy Despite such violent episodes of nature, today, this is one of the most tranquil places in the country, where you can walk for hours without seeing anyone. In autumn this walk will give you views across the estuary of over-wintering flocks of knot, oystercatchers, pintail and other ducks, and geese and egrets. In spring and summer it’s the colours that really strike you - blood red of cranesbills, harebells and Lady’s Bedstraw – a blaze of red, blue and yellow. There are lots of gullies and a network of deep ditches that make the area treacherous. The tide comes in very fast, and for many visitors walking along the coast here, one of the curiosities is the spectacle of Welsh mountain ponies standing neck-deep in water. The sheep, who also graze here, make a run for it ahead of the tides, but the ponies do sometimes come to grief, particularly the foals who find themselves treading water when they step inadvertently into the gullies. “The saltmarsh can be quite an eerie place,” said Sian. “You can often hear birds but not see them. The tide can creep in and all of sudden it's lapping over the top. It is a magical place to come at dawn or dusk.” Grade: Moderate Distance: Two and a half miles (4 km) Time: One hour and 30 minutes OS Map: Landranger 159; Explore 164 Terrain: The walk starts with a steep descent on a track and includes two moderately steep climbs along the route. The conditions underfoot range from sand and gravel to road surface and grass. Dogs allowed but be aware of stock grazing. Getting there By foot: Gower Explorer Nos 115, 116 and 119. For information, see Traveline Cymru. By train: The nearest train station is Swansea or Gowerton. Whiteford is 15 miles (24km) - 45 mins - by road from Swansea. By car: B4295 to Llanrhidian, then C road to Llanmadoc. Continue through the village till you get to Cwm Ivy. A private car park with an honesty box is on the right hand side of the road. Route Start: Cwm Ivy Woods, Gower, grid ref: SS441933 1. Starting from the car park in Cwm Ivy, turn left onto the road and head down into the village (don't forget to put money in the honesty box first). Walk through the village until you reach the National Trust gate signed 'Cwm Ivy Wood'. Go through the gate and follow the track down the hill. The track bears to the right and on your left is Cwm Ivy Tor. 2. Follow the track as it bears right through a gate and alongside a plantation. On your left you will pass Burrows Cottage. Continue along the track until you reach a gate on the far side of the plantation. The twisted and bent conifers on your left are Monterey pines. Look out for holes made by woodpeckers in the dead trees. 3 . Pass through the gate and continue for a short while on the track until you see the Medieval sea wall on your left, crossing the marsh. You may see Galloway and Hereford cattle on the way (AP) 4. Follow the footpath across the wall. On your left is a tidal saltmarsh. the vegetation is grazed by graziers with commons rights. Some of the lamb reared here is sold as 'salt marsh lamb'. The unique taste of this highly flavoured meat is thanks to the area's marsh vegetation. 5. Once over the wall, continue on the footpath as it passes by cottages and through a series of gates. There are fantastic views here over Landimore Marsh, which is owned by us, to your left. The rocky outcrops on your left beyond the marsh, are at Bovehill (also National Trust). If you're able to spare the time, the top of the outcrops provide a fantastic spot for a picnic overlooking the whole of the marsh and have great views of Weobley Castle to the north. 6. Follow the path past a stone built shed alongside the track and up a hill into Llanmadoc. The Britannia Inn is on your left if you need a well earned break at this point. 7. From the footpath turn right and walk up the hill through the village of Llanmadoc. You will pass a sign at the top of the hill for the 'Siop y Bobl' or 'the People's Shop'. You can get light refreshments and snacks from here. You will have earnt a well-deserved rest by the time you get back to the Britannia Inn Facilities Private car park in Cwm Ivy, half a mile from the walk start. No National Trust facilities on site, although there is a shop in Cwm Ivy village, which you pass en-route. Meals and refreshments can be purchased from the Brittania Inn in Llanmadoc, on the walk route.
