A prospectus soliciting contract proposals was issued in December 2014. A panel of technical experts reviewed each proposal package, and new five-year concession contracts were ultimately awarded to four businesses: Alaska Dream Cruises , American Cruise Lines, Inc ., Un-Cruise Adventures , and Lindblad Expeditions, Inc . Contracts will be effective January 1, 2016. \n\"It is exciting to see such a strong group of experienced tour operators partnering with the NPS to provide exceptional experiences in Glacier Bay,\" said park superintendent Philip Hooge. \nEach summer over 20,000 visitors experience the wonders of Glacier Bay from the decks of tour vessels, often as part of a longer Inside Passage itinerary. A typical day in Glacier Bay provides a spectacular journey through some of Alaska's finest scenery, and offers excellent wildlife viewing as well as a visit to multiple tidewater glaciers. \nThe new contracts will implement a variety of changes to reduce wilderness impacts for off-vessel activities, and through a cost-recovery program, provide National Park Service interpretive rangers on board each vessel to enhance the passenger experience. \nFor more information about concessions contracts in the National Park Service visit http://www.concessions.nps.gov/index.htm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:32:46.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
