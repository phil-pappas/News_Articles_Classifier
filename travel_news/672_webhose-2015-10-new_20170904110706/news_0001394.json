It comes months after the airline said it would axe loss-making routes, trim capacity and accelerate cost-cutting measures after it posted losses of €79 million, compared to a €14 million deficit a year earlier.\n\"We are turning round Air France-KLM,\" said de Juniac. \"We were facing huge losses but in two years we will be among the top guys for financial performance. Discussions with unions are always bumpy and that's not just for us, other airlines such as Lufthansa have had similar problems and they will always be like that when you are trying to put in difficult reforms.\"\nIn a 45-minute interview, which covered topics from Air France's financial performance to technological innovations, he spoke about the need to keep innovating the airline’s business class model, which he said is at \"the heart of Air France\".\nDe Juniac said the airline was looking to add wifi to its aircraft, but the financial costs must also be taken into consideration when rolling this out.\n\"The investment of wifi on planes is huge for us as it will cost around $500,000 per aircraft... and it makes it more costly because to make money on this is impossible as travellers are so used to getting it free everywhere they go.\"\nDe Juniac added that innovation in the way airlines market their products would become the big trend in aviation over the next few years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:16:26.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
