The Calgary-based airline recently announced they will be flying to London’s Gatwick Airport from five Canadian cities (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto and St. John’s) starting May 2016. The airline already flies to Dublin from St. John’s. \nAir Canada rouge , which bills itself as a leisure carrier and does not have the same comfort level or service offerings as Air Canada , will start flying from Toronto to London Gatwick on May 19, with flights up to seven times a week. A new Air Canada non-stop from Montreal to Lyon, France starts the month after that. \nOn top of all that, word came down last week that Iceland-based WOW Air will start flying from Toronto and Montreal to Reykjavik, Iceland in May 2016, with fares starting at $99 CAD one-way including tax. For another $149 one-way, also including tax, folks will be able to fly from Iceland to several cities in Europe, including Paris, London, Berlin, Rome, Barcelona and Copenhagen. \nPorter Airlines announced it will start its service between Toronto and Myrtle Beach on Feb. 11, 2016.

Other deals include Vancouver-Barcelona for $922 return, Calgary-Cancun for $323 one-way and Montreal-Paris for $702 return The sale is on until Oct. 13, 2016. \nDESTINATION OF THE WEEK \nKauai might be the most Hawaiian island of them. It’s almost certainly the most beautiful, with the rugged Na Pali cliffs and deep folds and valleys and stunning views of Waimea Canyon, sometimes called the Grand Canyon of the Pacific. The north coast around Hanalei looks like Tahiti with its wide bays and spiky mountain views and the broad Hanalei River valley laced with taro fields. On the west side, broad Poipu Beach offers fabulous resorts and great body surfing. The nearby town of Hanapape is a sleepy, artsy village with what’s billed as the southernmost book store in the United States. Check out Kukui O’Lono golf course for the best deal on the islands: $12 CAD to play all day on a funky course with average conditions, but killer views. Now is a good time to go to Hawaii as prices usually start to rise as we edge closer to winter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:22:49.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
