Last week, in one of those highly fashionable list-y articles (“10 ceremonial uses for beetroot”, “Five US crooners you didn’t know were evil”) I read that, during a French dinner , one must keep one’s hands on the table at all times. Not in your lap. On the table. This is true. “Traditionally, it’s to demonstrate that you aren’t armed,” explained a French friend, who gets more exciting dinner invitations than I do. • Travel etiquette: how to avoid offending the locals “But keeping your hands on the table doesn’t mean you haven’t left a bazooka in the cloakroom,” I said. “It’s never far.” He had no reply. No one ever has when you tackle the wherefores of table manners. They exist only to allow the established to make fools of newcomers. Noble French people, for instance, consider the cutting of lettuce ill-bred. You must instead fold it with your knife and fork into little, mouth-sized bundles. (No wonder the proles cut off the aristos’ powdered bloody heads; they’d been driven beyond endurance by the folding of lettuce. Since 1789, the lower orders have eaten salad any damned way they wanted to.) • The offal truth about French cuisine Photo: AP/FOTOLIA • Misusing a knife and fork is the eighth and deadliest sin Talking of knives and forks brings us directly to spaghetti. Italians insist that this should not be cut either . It should be twirled round one’s fork until there’s an accumulation the size of a ping-pong ball, then slurped up – there are always straggly bits – in a manner which, in non-Italians, invariably provides a poor spectacle. And for no purpose, except to give Italians another reason to feel superior, which they really don’t need. Spaghetti is soft. It begs to be cut up with a knife and fork, a process which in no way alters the taste. (No Italian can argue with that, for no Italian has ever eaten spaghetti thus.) \"Only a nation with no respect for human rights would insist its people eat rice with sticks\" And don’t get me started on chopsticks. Only a nation with no respect for human rights would insist its people eat rice with sticks. Should a hostess ever press chopsticks upon you, suggest she eats her soup with a rock. Ah. Yes. Soup. As the consommé comes to an end, the bowl is tipped away from you in polite England, towards you in France. It’s a dilemma I resolve by picking up the bowl and pouring the last drops straight into my mouth. That’s maybe why I don’t get that many dinner invitations. Or it could be because I tend to steal morsels from the plates of slow-eating neighbours. Photo: AP/FOTOLIA In truth, the only things I object to are a) people who start in on the smoked trout before their hostess is seated; b) open, noisy mouths and c) conversation concerning astrology, Buddhism or cricket. Otherwise, you’re welcome any time. Bon appétit. • How we forgot our table manners Telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:35:15.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
