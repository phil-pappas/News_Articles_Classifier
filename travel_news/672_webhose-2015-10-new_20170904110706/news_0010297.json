The deal is for eight years with an option on a further six aircraft.\nSAS said its \"strategy is to offer frequent travellers a broad network with frequent flights to, from and within Scandinavia\".\nRickard Gustafson, SAS president and CEO, said: \"We are looking forward to working with Cityjet to further expand our regional route network and thereby strengthen SAS' offering to frequent travellers.\n\"The eight brand new CRJ900s from Cityjet will provide us with efficient and flexible production of regional flights that will complement SAS' production on the larger traffic flows.\"\nCityjet has acquired 100 per cent of the shares in SAS subsidiary Blue 1. Blue1's B717 fleet has been reduced to five and will cease operating by the end of the year.\nPatrick Byrne, Cityjet's chairman of the board, said: \"This is a fantastic opportunity for Cityjet to work with a leading airline such as SAS.\n\"We are looking forward to a long-term cooperation, where we will deliver a high level of quality in terms of efficiency and customer service for SAS passengers.\n\"We are also keen to benefit from the experience and knowledge of the Nordic airline industry that the acquisition of Blue 1 will give us.\"\nCityjet launched an 18-times weekly service between Cork and London City this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:03:41.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
