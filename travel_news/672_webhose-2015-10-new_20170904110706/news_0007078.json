Travel, which was earlier associated with fun and family time, has now spread its branches to wellness and health sectors.In the past couple of years, Wellness Tourism has become an international trend. Health conscious travelers seek to enhance their travel experience by combining it with healthy activities and options. Dubai, one of the most ultra-modern destinations of the world, has embarked on projects with an objective to promote wellness tourism. It is expected that tourism of this kind will grow by more than 9 per cent per year through 2017. This figure is nearly 50 per cent faster than overall global tourism. Dubai’s vibrant travel industry is set to utilize all opportunities to transform it into a thriving destination for wellness needs. As leisure and business travelers to Dubai continues to grow, the numbers will only increase further and Dubai will become an internationally recognized place for excellent wellness services combined with amazingly interesting tourist spots. According to Anni Hood, director of wellness tourism at the Global Wellness Institute, “The region has added many hotels and resorts in recent years. Catering to key tourism markets of European, wealthy Asian, Gulf visitors and business travelers, extensive spa and fitness facilities are now standard and expected amenities in high-end hotel/resort and real estate developments.\" Whilst any normal trip is about a visit to the tourist attractions of a place, a wellness trip is about classic yoga, spa experiences, hot springs and thermal baths, cycling vacations, Pilates, aromatherapy treatments and even providing fitness classes on hotel rooftops or lawns. These are some unique experiences which add more exuberance to a vacation. Travel, which was earlier, associated with fun and adventure, has in recent times, expanded considerably owing to the stress associated in everyday lives. People take breaks to explore a destination along with a complete relaxation of oneself, which is otherwise not possible in busy schedules. Consequently, the needs as well as the demands of travelers have changed. They want customized wellness programmes to boost their energy levels. Amidst beautiful surroundings, they want to experience a state of relaxation. Dubai has shown consistent progress in travel and tourism. Apart from tourists, it aims to draw leading medical practitioners from across the world to continue accelerating this growth. With its robust and transparent marketing strategies, the country has a lot to offer in health care and wellness. There is a difference between medical tourism and wellness tourism. Medical tourists may visit Dubai for seeking treatment for a disease or illness whereas wellness tourists may seek only rejuvenation. They may be perfectly healthy, only looking for an improved lifestyle, combined with an ideal travel experience. The market for wellness tourists is greater at present. Wellness tourism is indeed an important division within the industry. In order to offer the ultimate customer experience, hotels, resorts and recreational centers in Dubai are coming up with complete wellness tourism packages for guests.
