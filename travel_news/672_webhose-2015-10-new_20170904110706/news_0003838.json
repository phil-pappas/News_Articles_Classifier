Exporting to new markets across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) is central to the strategy of the family-owned business, which is based in Liverpool. The maker of well-known brands Perfect Finish and Essentials wants a sizeable 85pc of its future revenues to come from exporting, and already sells its products in 90 different countries. Its European business began in the Fifties, with the UK-based company being established in 1966 Recognising that it needed a cash injection to support its growth plans, Turtle Wax turned to Bibby Financial Services, which agreed to provide the business with a £6m funding facility. “We have ambitious plans to grow throughout the EMEA region and required a finance partner that not only understood the history and seasonality of our business, but could also support our expansion plans for the future,” explains Mark Brickhill, EMEA president for Turtle Wax. “Bibby Financial Services was able to demonstrate both experience and acumen in structuring a finance package that was competitive and flexible.” Once Turtle Wax and Bibby Financial Services had negotiated the multi-million-pound facility, Bibby’s corporate team structured the agreement. The team, which was formed in October 2012, specialises in developing larger transactions, and over the past two years has structured more than 300 deals, providing available funds of over £275m. Working with Turtle Wax was a great opportunity, according to Paul Fraser, Bibby Financial Services’ head of sales. “Turtle Wax is a fantastic business with an impressive heritage,” he says. “This was a complex deal, and to make sure it worked for the business, we first needed to understand its plans for the future. Turtle Wax has set itself a target to double its turnover to more than £30m within five years “We were able to do this effectively, and this deal is a testament to our corporate finance capabilities, demonstrating our support for businesses in any stage of their lifecycle – from rapid growth to expansion.” Turtle Wax has a long history, dating back to 1946, when it was first incorporated in Chicago. Its European business began in the Fifties, with the UK-based company being established in 1966. Mr Brickhill is confident that securing the funding facility has now put the business on course to strengthen its international brand even further. He says: “With funding and support from Bibby in place, we’re in a fantastic position to grow our business in the UK and abroad.” • Read more about funding business growth at www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:20:21.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
