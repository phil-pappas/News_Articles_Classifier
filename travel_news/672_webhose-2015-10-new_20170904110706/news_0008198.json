Escorted by BYD's Founder and Chairman Wang Chuanfu and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge , President Xi boarded the bus designed and built by BYD and will be in revenue service soon on London streets. The new bus emits no pollution or emissions and was developed after the Mayor of London challenged Mr. Wang and BYD to develop a vehicle which many experts said was not technically feasible – an electric double-decker bus. Two years later BYD delivered on the challenge!\nAlso present at today's ceremony at London's Lancaster House was Colin Robertson , CEO of Alexander Dennis Ltd (ADL). BYD and ADL announced a partnership to build buses together which has the potential to generate £2 billion sales for the two companies in the next 10 years. Isbrand Ho , Managing Director of BYD Europe said, \"This event underscores that the era of electric buses has arrived. We have proven battery electric technology as demonstrated in this new double-decker, transit bus. In ADL, we have an outstanding and experienced bus building partner. Together we can supply bus operators with the products they need.\" The new double-decker bus can carry 81 passengers and is fully air conditioned. It will be able to complete up to 190 miles in city traffic conditions on a single charge, allowing recharging (which takes just four hours) using lower-cost, off-peak electricity.\nLondon has a 9,000-strong bus fleet carrying 6.5 million passengers a day, more demanding than Paris and New York combined. Two BYD single-decker, electric Transit buses have been in successful trials with Go-Ahead on two TFL routes for almost two years and recently BYD secured an order for a further 51 electric buses for operation by Go-Ahead. The order marks the first stage of a partnership between BYD and Alexander Dennis Ltd (ADL) –BYD providing its battery and electric chassis and power-train technology and ADL, its strong experience in bus bodybuilding – with final assembly of the complete buses being carried out at its Falkirk, Scotland plant. The partnership was signed during today's event bringing the two companies closer together.\nAbout BYD\nBYD Company Ltd. is the world's largest maker of pure electric buses. Its vehicles have been tested by 147 cities worldwide and proved to have significant operational cost benefits, as well as being totally environment friendly. Two of its single decks have been in service with Go-Ahead in London for 18 months and the successful in-service experience of these vehicles – which are able to complete a day's route service on a single battery charge – has been instrumental in securing this latest contract. The world's first pure electric double deck is also being developed by BYD and TFL recently announced that five will enter trial service with Metroline in London later this year.\nBYD is one of China's largest companies to have successfully expanded globally. Specializing in battery technologies, their green mission to \"solve the whole problem\" has made them industry pioneers and leaders in several High-tech sectors including High-efficiency Automobiles, Electrified Public Transportation, Environmentally-Friendly Energy Storage, Affordable Solar Power and Information Technology and Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) services.\nAs the world's largest manufacturer of rechargeable batteries, their mission to create safer and more environmentally friendly battery technologies has lead to the development of the BYD Iron Phosphate (or \"Fe\") Battery. This fire-safe, completely recyclable and incredibly long-cycle technology has become the core of their clean energy platform that has expanded into automobiles, buses, trucks, utility vehicles and energy storage facilities. BYD and all of their shareholders, including the great American Investor Warren Buffett, see these environmentally and economically forward products as the way of the future.\nBYD has made a strong entrance to the North, Central and South American markets with their battery electric buses, and lineup of automobiles. Their mission lies not just in sales growth, but also in sociological integration and local job creation as they have poured incredible investments into developing offices, dealerships and manufacturing facilities in the local communities they now call home, truly a first for Chinese companies.
