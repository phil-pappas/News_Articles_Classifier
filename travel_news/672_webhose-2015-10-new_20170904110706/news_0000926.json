Da Nang’s sandy, sun-baked lick unfurls some 20 miles along the East Sea and is hitched between the forested, monkey-inhabited, US-radar-cluttered Son Tra peninsula in the north, and the smaller knobbles of the holy Marble Mountains to the south. Set back from the beach, Da Nang is criss-crossed with bridges over the Han river, and its suburbs nudge up to the edge of the Truong Son Mountains where sunsets streak a magenta haze over this city backdrop. \nI was watching the sun blush from the rooftop terrace of Fusion Suites, part of a new cluster of sleek high-rise hotels on China Beach that are close to town. Sipping on their signature cocktail – a pho (beef noodle soup) tipple of gin, Cointreau, cardamom and coriander that was ignited at my table, I reflected on how far things had come. \nI first visited the area, nicknamed China Beach (My Khe in Vietnamese) by the GIs, in 2004. Back then there was one international resort on the sands; guidebooks wrote off the area in a few unappealing words. \nVietnam offered the American soldier in-country Rest and Relaxation \nToday, there are golf courses, private villas and some 150 resorts and counting, unwrapped along the coast. Most offer luxurious spa therapies, yoga and reiki. Other resorts, which also provide pampering therapies, could get away with just the stimulus of their whimsical design flair: the gorgeous oriental InterContinental Da NangSun Peninsula fashioned by Bill Bensley, the design king of Asian luxury resorts, and the new striking Naman Retreat, a chic homage to bamboo, with its cathedral-like dining room crowned by a chandelier of huge dangling rice-shaped lanterns, designed by the darling of Vietnam’s new architecture, Vo Trong Nghia. \nBut it’s not just the beach makeover that has stirred Da Nang from its long snooze: new architecture and design have been making headlines, too. The swivelled skyscraper of the city’s hi-tech admin HQ pulsates in neon at night; a Da Nang couple commissioned the Termitary, an airy aerated brick cube that pays homage to the ruddy red brick monuments of the Cham, early rulers of central Vietnam; and a number of kooky bridges arc the Han river – the red Love Bridge clamped with love locks, and the intriguingly hypnotic fire-breathing, water-spurting golden dragon who shoots his armoury over his own bridge every weekend. \nDa Nang, it seems, is on the ascendant, reinventing itself for the 21st century. For years it seemed unsure how to lure Western tourists away from two World Heritage Sites that are pegged either side – the imperial city of Hue, and the delightful riverine ochre-splashed ancient port of Hoi An. But there was one man who had a vision for Da Nang as a modern metropolis: Nguyen Ba Thanh. Thanh was dubbed the King of Da Nang. One local told me: “He could have been a future leader of Vietnam; it’s very sad. \n“Thanh gave jobs and homes to the poor, built bridges, upgraded the airport, attracted industry and built the big beach road.” When he died early this year, thousands flocked to his home to mourn. \nToday the city’s self-esteem glows amid the fairy lights and communist flags: the Brilliant Hotel, Happy Hotel, Luxury Hotel and Five Star Hotel have opened; the only person in the world who professes to chop locks with samurai swords works out of the city, a taxi firm takes drunk drivers home for free; a young woman from the English Power community dancing cha-cha on the riverfront told me the group aimed to make Da Nang a bilingual hub; the Asian Beach Games arrive next year; and the food is celebrated. \nIn looking forward, Da Nang is also celebrating its past. The Cham, a powerful Hinduised kingdom with Sanskrit culture, emerged in the second century and lived in 10 important sites within Da Nang, a new exhibition reveals. \nThe jungle ruins of My Son are the spiritual capital of the Cham \nDa Nang’s Cham Museum also showcases the breadth of sandstone sculptures of gods and celestial beings, but it’s at the jungle ruins of My Son, south west of Da Nang, the spiritual capital of the Cham, that their exquisite craftsmanship, revealed in a set of 72 petite temples, can be truly appreciated. We headed to My Son in a 1960 US army jeep with Active Adventures Vietnam passing markets, conical-hatted cyclists, temples and rice paper makers. The sunlight flushed the beautiful plant-draped platforms, and carved Hindu deities glinted at us at dawn. \nIn another jungle setting, roaming high above Da Nang in the world’s longest single-wire cable car (at 5,771m), we spied a white ship lolling off Red Beach. Red Beach, just north of China Beach, is a perfectly punched crescent of sand where the US troops came ashore in 1965. It was an American presence of a different kind – a hospital ship, USNS Mercy, staffed with thousands of medics. \nThe past was a different country and later that day as we stretched out on the sand watching swimmers, sunbathers, surfers and meditators, I wondered if those American troops could have predicted how their own treasured R&R spot would turn out.
