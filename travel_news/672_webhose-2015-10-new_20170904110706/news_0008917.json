A crowd filled George Street for the long-awaited dedication of the Charleston Gaillard Center on Friday. Wade Spees/Staff October 9, 2015 × The Gaillard Center, a multipurpose building that houses new concert and exhibition halls, and consolidates city offices, is open for business. It’s been a long time in the making. Three years of construction, preceded by about four years of planning — all of which followed a period of increasing dissatisfaction with the acoustically deficient and aesthetically displeasing Gaillard Municipal Auditorium — has resulted in this $142 million facility. Friday’s dedication ceremony and open house revealed the space to the public for the first time. Mayor Joe Riley paid tribute to one of his predecessors, J. Palmer Gaillard, for whom the original building, built in 1968, was named. “Without that building, this wouldn’t have been possible,” Riley said. He said the city benefits most when it looks to the future. “It’s easy to become … so admiring of the past that we spend our time looking backwards,” he said. But great cities “use the past to inspire us.” The exterior of the Gaillard Center is a neo-Classical design meant to echo the College of Charleston’s Randolph Hall just up George Street, and to lend some cultural gravitas to the cityscape. The interior includes a gracious lobby; 15,000-square feet “ballroom” with pre-function space and a set of “salons,” or conference breakout rooms; a horseshoe-shaped 1,800-seat opera-theater, and an array of city offices. “Every civic building should be built with an extraordinary commitment to beauty and excellence, because every citizen owns it,” Riley said, calling the center “this generation’s gift to the future.” Aesthetic quality ultimately heightens the impact of what happens inside the building, he said. When the space is beautiful, “then the music is more wonderful, the artistry is more profound and memories are more permanent.” Martha Rivers Ingram, whose initial gift and civic leadership helped to get the project going, praised the designers, David M. Schwarz Architects, Earl Swensson Associates and Evans & Schmidt Architects, for creating a center “even more beautiful that we asked for.” Ingram said the facility was devoted not only to performances and exhibitions but to education, “hopefully for 300 years or longer.” The dedication ceremony drew hundreds of city officials, civic leaders and residents, all of whom got a chance to explore the interior of the building after the speeches were done. Among those in attendance was Byron Stahl, son of the late David Stahl who led the Charleston Symphony Orchestra for 25 years before succumbing in 2010 to cancer. The young Stahl was impressed, saying the Gaillard Center was “the future of Charleston” and recalled the old Gaillard Municipal Auditorium, which served its purpose but was a bane of his father’s existence. David Stahl spoke often, if quietly and respectfully, of the need for a proper concert hall, and now the city has one. “This was his lifelong dream,” Byron Stahl said.
