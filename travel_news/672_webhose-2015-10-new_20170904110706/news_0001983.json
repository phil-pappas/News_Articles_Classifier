Upstairs, a ghoulish waxwork of Catherine Eddowes – the Ripper’s fourth victim, murdered in 1888 – sits in an otherwise empty room. There are just a few pieces of A4 paper dedicated to talking about the women, in the entire six-storey museum. So it’s little wonder that the Ripper Museum is now seeking to repair some of the reputational damage that’s dogged it since opening in July . This, after all, was supposed to be a ‘women’s museum’ – hailed as the only space dedicated to the history of women in the East End and promising to tell stories ‘through their eyes’. Part of the exhibition inside the museum Photo: Rex Instead, and to the surprise of almost everyone, it emerged as an attraction dedicated to the unidentified Victorian prostitute killer . Campaign groups, feminist protestors and academics alike have joined forces to call for its closure ever since, claiming it glamorises sexual violence against women and that this hoped-for ‘feminist museum’ is misogynistic through and through. The London Post, November 9th 1888 Photo: ALAMY Owner Mark Palmer-Edgecumbe now hopes to deflect such criticism. He has appointed a seven-strong female advisory board in an attempt to reduce the outcry the museum's opening provoked. I found myself somewhat surprised at this news. Surely a museum dedicated to telling us the history of the Ripper murders 'from the perspectives of the women who were his victims' – as Palmer-Edgecumbe claims - would already have had a number of female advisors in place? \"Instead of a museum dedicated to the women as they lived and seen ‘through their eyes’, we have a museum filled with anachronism and waxwork corpses\" After all, this is a tourist destination that deals with the subjects of sexual violence and prostitution. The owner is the ex-head of diversity at Google. So it’s reasonable to assume there must have been discussions on how to present these topics correctly, especially as they are still central to the modern women's movement. Right? Palmer-Edgecumbe recently appeared to liken criticism of his museum to the persecution and torture suffered during the Nazi regime . In an interview, he said: \"some of the stuff they have written about me online is hurtful and hideous – there’s a thuggish aspect – going around and smashing people’s windows and daubing them with paint is exactly what the Nazis did to the Jews in Germany and I think we disapprove of that…whether that’s in 1939 or 2015. \"I’m not Jewish but I am gay and the Nazis targeted hundreds of thousands of gay people – so that’s why in my mind I see this very startling comparison between then and now. I am not going to allow a few bullies to shut down my museum.\" Meanwhile, the Ripper Museum's PR man claimed there was no evidence of sexual violence in the murders - comments which have since been retracted.

They do get this right, at least, in the only two areas in the vast building dedicated to the women themselves: Mary Ann Nichols, Catherine Eddowes, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride and Mary Jane Kelly. There is also a passing mention of the 'Whitechapel Murders' - a case file kept by the police on a number of unsolved violent attacks on women in the East End over a two year period, of which the Ripper murders were considered a part. But, as I discovered to my horror, there is only scant information given about the women themselves - their names and some brief biographical detail. Nothing is presented 'through their eyes' or those of their female contemporaries, as the museum originally promised. Here’s some information about just one of the women killed at the hands of the Ripper . Mary Ann Nichols was 43 when she died. She was 5'2, with brown eyes and greying hair. Originally from a Soho family of locksmiths, Mary Ann had married William Nichols while she was in her twenties, quickly becoming a mother to five children, Edward, Percy, Alice, Eliza and Henry. The marriage had broken down in 1881, and the newspapers picked over the possible reasons after her death. Was it due to William's affair with the nurse who attended the birth of Henry? Had Mary Ann suffered from alcoholism? Whatever reason led to their separation, without the support and protection of her husband Mary Ann's life became increasingly difficult. Left with few options in a society that didn't have a welfare state, she turned to prostitution, crippled by a severe dependency on alcohol. When William discovered she was earning money from 'illicit means' he was able to stop the five shilling allowance he had previously been required to give her. Sinking even further into poverty, by 1888, the year of the Ripper murders, Mary Ann was found sleeping rough in Trafalgar Square and sent to the workhouse. She left, hopeful of finding work, but soon ended up back on the streets in the East End, supporting herself through prostitution until her murder. Each victim – whether one of the canonical five or the eleven women held in the 'Whitechapel Murders' case file - have their own story, families, friends and lives before their horrifying death. Some even have living descendants. And yet, instead of a museum dedicated to the women as they lived and seen ‘through their eyes’, we have a museum filled with anachronism and waxwork corpses. A woodcut of one of Jack the Ripper's victims Photo: REX FEATURES The Jack the Ripper Museum is a badly done attraction, with little regard for the lives of the women it supposedly portrays. Other than a few sides of paper and a glass case of bonnets, there is nothing to tell you about who these women were, and how they lived. Their violent murders aren’t set in context and come over as nameless violence inflicted on nameless women. This so-called museum is profiting solely from the victimisation of women, and contains no new or up-to-date research. I’d have hoped that, more than a century after the events, we might now be in a place to take a more nuanced look at such crimes and not fall back on shock tactics. Frankly, it left me feeling sick to my stomach. A spokesperson for the museum said: “We are a museum about Jack the Ripper that tells the story of a turbulent time in East End history from a new, unique and exciting angle. We look at the horrific crimes of Jack the Ripper through the eyes of the women who were his victims. A look at the woman's bedroom inside the Jack the Ripper museum Photo: Rex \"Visitors are welcome to come and see, hear, touch, smell and feel what it was like to be one of the Ripper’s victims in a restored Victorian building. \"As such, it was important to us that women were intricately part of the museum’s set up. Our curator was a female historian and our interior designer was also a woman. Four out of seven employees are also women – local, working mothers – many of whom were long term unemployed before the museum hired them. \"Our new Board of women advisors is a continuation of that support and guidance – especially concerning our planned charity work”. It might just be too little, too late. telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:23:53.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
