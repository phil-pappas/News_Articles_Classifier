Simon, a college student, was one of those whose life has been closely associated with a scooter. USA, 15 October 2015 -- The Airwheel electric scooter, as a state-of-the-art means of commuting, now has been widely accepted among the people both in urban and rural areas. It is quite common to see someone passing by one the street every now and then riding an electric scooter and it has been closely associated almost with every part of people’s life. Simon, an extroverted boy who was pursing his study in a university in New York, was one of those who had taken the scooter as an indispensible part of their life. First of all, an Airwheel self-balancing scooters is a kind of vehicle which could take one from one place to another. Thus Simon would ride it to the teaching building and library every day to get him backed up with the latest knowledge and then ride it back to his dormitory every night afterwards. Apart from this, when he got a message telling him to sign for his parcel, he usually scooted all the way to the entrance of the university or the specific parcel-receiving centre set up in the university. While the college was, as a matter of fact, quite large, a great amount of Simon’s time and energy was saved as a result. What a relief!And the time and energy saved was then spent in doing something what Simon was truly interested. Simon felt an intimate relationship with the nature and he couldn’t resist the temptation to take every possible record of the things he considered as beautiful with his camera. He used to walked around the campus to capture the beauty that touched him, yet his way of moving was therefore changed since he got an Airwheel intelligent scooter . Every time he desired to take pictures of the world, the electric scooter was the thing that he would definitely take with him and his perspective of the nature was thus changed as well. Good for him! # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:33:01.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
