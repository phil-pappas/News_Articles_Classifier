The company was presented the award at the 26th Annual TTG Travel Awards 2015 Ceremony in Bangkok, Thailand this evening.\nRoyal Caribbean has been voted unanimously by readers of TTG Asia, TTG China, TTG India, TTGmice, TTG-BTmice China, TTGassociations and TTG Asia Luxury for the award. The TTG Travel Awards are given out annually to honour organizations in Asia Pacific’s travel industry for their strong commitment towards service excellence.\nRoyal Caribbean won the award for offering the best product, services and facilities. This is exemplified by the introduction of Quantum of the Seas to Asia this year and its many revolutionary first-at-sea amenities such as the North Star elevated glass capsule, skydiving simulator, the Bionic Bar with robotic bartenders, and Seaplex, the largest indoor active space at sea with bumper cars and a circus school. This award is also recognition for Royal Caribbean for being the most professional sales and marketing team in terms of innovative ideas and servicing.\nSean Treacy, Managing Director, Singapore & Southeast Asia of Royal Caribbean Cruises (Asia) Pte Ltd. who received the award said, “It’s a great achievement for us to win this prestigious award for eight years running, which shows how much Royal Caribbean International has grown to be the cruise brand of choice in Asia. For this, we deeply thank our trade partners and customers for their continued strong support. We aim to keep delivering exceptional holidays to more and more of them with our revolutionary ships, innovative style of cruising and high service standards and value as our business grows in Asia.”\nRoyal Caribbean will kick-start its longest-ever Singapore season this month on Mariner of the Seas from October 2015 to March 2016, which comes with signature features such as the Royal Promenade, ice skating rink, full-sized sports court and DreamWorks Entertainment. What its trade partners and guests can also look forward to is the upcoming new Quantum Class ship, Ovation of the Seas, which is arriving in Asia next June with two special sailings from Singapore. She will bring more of the Quantum Class experience to Asia, which is expected to create another wave of excitement for cruising in the region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:14:41.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
