Not so for British former lawyer Helen Pattinson. On a 1990s trip to South America, Pattinson stumbled upon a place that would change her life forever: an entire town dedicated to chocolate. San Carlos de Bariloche is a beautiful lakeside town on the slopes of the Andes, where gorgeous alpine scenery has long attracted German and Swiss settlers. Pattinson and her future husband Simon arrived in the Argentine town more than a decade ago while touring South America during a career break.

Their trip took them through Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. Eureka moment 10 photos: Burning bridges – Tired of their lives as lawyers in 1990s London, Helen and Simon Pattinson headed for South America to find a way out of the rat race. \"We sold our house,\" says Helen. \"We gave up our jobs and put everything into storage except a rucksack full of stuff and a tent.\" Hide Caption 1 of 10 10 photos: Culture and climate – The couple traveled across South America, from the southern tip of Argentina to the most northerly point of Venezuela. \"The breadth of culture and climate there is like a planet itself,\" says Helen Pattinson. \"It's unbelievable.\" Hide Caption 2 of 10 10 photos: Bariloche, Argentina – Eventually their travels took them to Bariloloche in Argentina, a beautiful town settled by European migrants drawn over the centuries by the alpine-style scenery. Hide Caption 3 of 10 10 photos: Andean foothills – Bariloche has long been a significant tourism center in Argentina and has developed extensive skiing, trekking and mountaineering networks. Hide Caption 4 of 10 10 photos: Chocolate City – Bariloche is also famous for chocolate shops. \"Simon was actually laid up with an upset stomach for about three days, so we booked ourselves into a hotel,\" Helen Pattinson recalls. \"While he was in there I didn't want to drift too far, so I spent three days walking around this little town, only to discover it had 10 chocolate shops.\" Hide Caption 5 of 10 10 photos: 'Eureka moment' – \"I was in heaven. I've always loved chocolate,\" says Helen Pattinson of Bariloche. She says the city provided the couple with their \"eureka moment.\" Hide Caption 6 of 10 10 photos: Travels in chocolate – As they continued their travels, the couple learned more about the chocolate industry, even camping in a cocoa plantation in Venezuela when the road was blocked by farmers using the asphalt to dry cocoa beans. Hide Caption 7 of 10 10 photos: Back in Britain – Returning to the UK, they founded Montezuma's Chocolates in Chichester, a seaside town south of London. Their business is named after the Aztec emperor who first gifted chocolate to European explorers whom he mistook for gods. Hide Caption 8 of 10 10 photos: Montezuma – Montezuma now produces 250,000 metric tons of chocolate annually -- roughly equivalent to 25 million bars.

I've created a business out of a product that I am passionate about. I get to eat chocolate for breakfast every day.\" Hide Caption 10 of 10 The mission appeared to falter when Simon was struck with food poisoning as they arrived in Bariloche. But Pattinson says this soon turned out to be their \"eureka moment.\" \"Simon was actually laid up with an upset stomach for about three days, so we booked ourselves into a hotel,\" she recalls. \"While he was in there I didn't want to drift too far, so I spent three days walking around this little town, only to discover it had 10 chocolate shops. \"I was in heaven. I've always loved chocolate.\" A spark ignited in Bariloche -- known as the City of Chocolate -- was kindled by other events on their journey. \"We ended up in Venezuela and at one point our whole journey was thwarted by cocoa farmers,\" Pattinson says. \"They were drying cocoa beans completely across the road, because the road is the hottest thing that they can access.\" Stranded, they decided to pitch camp in a nearby cocoa plantation for a few days. 'World domination' In honor of its origins, the Pattinson's chocolate is named after Aztec emperor Montezuma. \"By this time we were completely enthralled by the whole subject of chocolate,\" says Pattinson. \"Fortunately, South America had so much to offer in terms of its history and the geography and botany of it and we sure weren't short of information about chocolate. \"So we started talking about how we could set up a business around chocolate -- it dominated our thoughts.\" Those thoughts didn't fade when the couple eventually returned to the UK. In August 2000 they founded Montezuma's Chocolates in Chichester, a seaside town south of London. From a small operation equipped with a \"kitchen sink-sized machine\" the luxury chocolate company has grown into a serious operation with an annual revenue of more than $11 million. Having been inspired by their journey to create chocolate, the Pattinsons are now sending their chocolate on its own journey. With production at 250,000 metric tons of chocolate annually -- roughly equivalent to 25 million bars -- Montezuma is expanding into markets in the United States, China, the Middle East and continental Europe. \"We can't stop creating, we can't stop growing ... so really world domination with chocolate is the key,\" Pattinson says. \"I am really lucky. I've created a business out of a product that I am passionate about. \"I get to eat chocolate for breakfast every day.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> The Trip That Changed My Life", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:29:02.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
