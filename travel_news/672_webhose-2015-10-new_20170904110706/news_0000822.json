(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n656 CONNECT 121 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Disneyland, water parks, national parks: All great places to bring the kids. This list of places? Not so much. From destinations where they might get to see Spiderman being arrested for punching a police officer in the face to the world's most expensive restaurants, there are all sorts of reasons to avoid these family-unfriendly spots. Would you ever bring your young ones to any of these destinations? Debate in the comments!\nSpring break in Cancun or Acapulco, Mexico\nUnless your kids like swimming in pools full of spilled swim-up bar alcohol (and who knows what else), steer clear of most major resorts in Cancun and Acapulco during college spring break season. You'll be kept up late by thumping music and noisy parties, and your kids will get a little education in what college life can be like.\nInstead: Riviera Maya, Riviera Nayarit, La Paz and Todos los Santos all attract fewer spring breakers and more families, and are likely to be more low-key in February and March.\nTimes Square\nTimes Square may have cleaned up since the days of \"adult stores\" and peep shows, but it's still not the best environment for kids. Oh you think they'll like the costumed characters that take photos for tips? Unless you want to traumatize them by seeing Spider Man arrested for punching a police officer in the face , Elmo dragged away in handcuffs , or the Cookie Monster groping someone , you should maybe take them to a real theme park instead. C'mon, do you really want to subject them to the \" creepy baby \" character that hangs out there? It gives even grown adults nightmares.\nInstead: Take the kids to Greenwood Park in Brooklyn, a family-friendly beer garden that allows kids in before 7 p.m. The kids can run wild in the 13,000-square-foot space while the parents enjoy a cold beverage.\nLas Vegas\nLas Vegas is a playground all right, but in much of it, admission is restricted to those over 18 (or 21). Kids can't hang out on the casino floors, and anyone under 21 won't be allowed into the famous clubs and bars. Plus, any time you venture out on to the Strip, you're likely to be accosted with flyers featuring scantily clad \"performers\" and \"escorts,\" which your kids don't really need to see.\nInstead: The Grand Canyon and other nearby parks. If you're set on Nevada, the Grand Canyon offers much more wholesome sightseeing and family bonding than Las Vegas.\nThe world's most expensive restaurants\nSuper expensive restaurants with multi-course meals that last three or more hours have become a big trend lately. If your kids are more satisfied with chicken fingers and apple slices, do you really think they'll enjoy sitting still for an extended period past their bed times and dining on \"gastro-sensory\" delights like flavored foam? Save your $2,000 (yes, that's really how much a dinner costs at Sublimotion in Ibiza) and take them somewhere that caters to younger diners.\nInstead: Treat your kids to a night out at a fun themed restaurant (like the ones in this list ... well, most of them. Probably not Dans le Dark) where they'll get more of a kick out of the decor and the food than at a fancier place.\nFirst class\nFlying with kids in first class is a very controversial subject. (In fact, Malaysia Airlines banned infants from some of their first-class cabins a few years ago.) Let's face it, anyone who's invested thousands of dollars for a ticket in order to get some sleep on a lie-flat bed is not going to enjoy the screaming in the seat behind them. Don't believe this issue is a touchy subject? Just check out the comments in this article , this one or this one . (We admire investor Kevin O'Leary's approach , who apparently flies first class and puts his son in economy, telling him that he can travel in the premium cabin when he can pay for his ticket himself.)\nInstead: Splurge on economy plus seats that offer priority boarding and more leg room. You'll have more room for the kids to spread out (and it makes it harder to kick the seat in front of them), plus you'll have more time to get on board and get settled. Just make sure to not select an exit row seat, as those have age requirements.\nBourbon Street, New Orleans\nIt kind of always feels like Mardi Gras on New Orleans' Bourbon Street, which is full of bars and inebriated adults sloshing Hand Grenades everywhere. Unless you want your kids trying to pick shiny beads off the street, skip this section of New Orleans.\nInstead: Royal Street (also in the French Quarter) has more sober types of entertainment, like roving street performers, toy stores and costume shops.\nMurano glass factory, Italy\nDo you really trust your kids to keep their hands to themselves when they're surrounded by shiny, openly-displayed, delicate glass at a place like the Vecchia Murano Glass Factory a short ferry ride from Venice? That could be a very expensive gamble if sticky fingers accidentally knock over something.\nInstead: Just visit one of the free glass blowing demonstrations on the island of Murano instead -- the kids will probably love the fire and show. Save your shopping for when the kids aren't around.\nREAD THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE: Seven places you don't want to bring the family\n656 CONNECT 121 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read
