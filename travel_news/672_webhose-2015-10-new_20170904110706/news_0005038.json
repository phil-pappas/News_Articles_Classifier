Award judge Bob Heile explains: “just having the right equipment is not enough – how to configure and organise it is the secret to success.” Bob is founding member of the ZigBee Alliance, having effectively written the rule book for wireless standards he is the perfect judge for the Award.\nHe is also involved in more than six different conferences on WIFI and digital communications annually where he tests at first hand the quality of digital communications in venues across the globe. Bob together with an international panel of judges will review the nominations and the winners will be announced at IMEX Frankfurt in April 2016.\nRoslyn McLeod, INCON Co Chair has said: “now in its third year, INCON looks forward to receive entries for this year’s award and encourages all venues to review the best practice case studies from previous winners.\nSource:- INCON", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:32:47.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
