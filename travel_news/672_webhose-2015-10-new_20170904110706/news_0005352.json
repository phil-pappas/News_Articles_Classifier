Will you be writing about it if you are going?\nOn a side note, it is rediculous that the aircraft is left sitting overnight in HKG! I should imagine HKG/DFW operating as an overnight flight, touching down at DFW around 5am, in time for connecting flights. At the moment AA138 leaves too late to allow for decent connections.\n0 report reply 1 1 hour, 10 minutes ago by David Of course we're going :)\n0 report reply 2 1 minute ago by ausdt I trust AA knows what does or doesn't work for its own network. Some points that I consider relevant:\n> Adjusting the current service times (HKG departure at 1330 and DFW arrival at 1515) to allow for a 0500 DFW arrival, the aircraft would have to leave HKG at 0315 which is downright nasty.\n> You can make afternoon / evening connections in DFW to lots of places including IAD, BOS, EWR, ORD and MIA (I'm not going to list every possible combination however).\n> Codeshare partner CX offers so many other services including directs into many of the big cities and you can get onwards connections from there if required (the whole point of oneworld!)\n1 report reply 3 1 hour, 13 minutes ago by bsbtraveller Would fly that over those awful A380 Marc Newsom biz seats. Just came up last night on QF93 and was thinking how nice it was flying on the new 330 product back from BKK recently. QF will need to up their game or we'll all be on AA metal\n-1 report reply 4 1 hour, 12 minutes ago by smit0847 Its interesting that AA are continuing with intl F class. When you have a fantastic J hard product (as AA do) the only thing you can really offer above that in F is a better soft product and with AA's soft product in all classes being dreadful there's very little differentiation between J and F. I had to double check that the F photo above was F and not J - they are so similar. DL and UA have already realised this - I wonder why AA havent. SQ has a similar problem - their J product is so good that its hard to differentiate F. The difference between SQ and AA is that the soft product in both classes is excellent.\n3 report reply 5 1 hour, 1 minute ago by TIMOS It's very interesting that AA now have a much better product business class than Qantas to LA.\nThe A380/747 seat is 8 years old now. This AA one just 2 years old.\nOf course Qantas wins hands down on lounges, food and service. But AA has the much better hard product.\nDoes the Qantas 747 or A380 have mood lighting?", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://twitter.com/#!/djsflynn", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:08:55.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
