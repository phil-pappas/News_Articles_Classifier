Well, after innocent missionary Jermaine Luther Walker from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was senselessly shot and killed in Kingston, writer Ripliancum declared on FreeRepublic.com “Jamaica is a toilet.” Is Jamaica really that notorious? This week, the Jamaica Gleaner reported seven out of 10 eligible voters in their country believe crime and violence in Jamaica is so out of control not even their own government can rectify it. Between January and September 5 this year, 826 people were murdered in the small island nation, an increase of 20 percent over last year. \nInternations.org criticizes Jamaica unequivocally: \nOne of the largest problems modern day Jamaica has to face on a daily basis is the widespread criminal activity on the island. The term ‘criminal activity’ is not only limited to what is classically associated with it. True, drug trafficking, especially the cocaine trade and the gang violence that often comes with it, robberies, theft, and all sorts of violent crimes are common and serious issues in Jamaica. However, large scale corruption on almost all levels of the administration is also cause for concern. \nJamaican Cave warned LGTB tourists of a sweeping, precarious threat: \nIf you are gay, don't even consider stepping foot on the island. Not only is it illegal to be homosexual in Jamaica, some Jamaicans believe that gays should be killed. The primary musical genre, Dancehall, is replete with songs that encourage this. This belief is often acted upon, such as with the murder of Steve Harvey. \nSteve Harvey was an AIDS activist who worked to slow the spread of HIV in Jamaica, rates which double every few years. The police did nothing after his murder. It took the coercion of the United Nations to force Jamaica to search for Harvey’s killers. He had taken over the work of gay activist Brian Williamson, who was found murdered at his home with multiple stab wounds to his neck and face with his throat cut, just a year earlier. In 2006, Time magazine called Jamaica “the most homophobic place on Earth.” \nHuman Rights Watch reported last year: \nLGBT Jamaicans are vulnerable to both physical and sexual violence and many live in constant fear, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. They are taunted, threatened, fired from their jobs, thrown out of their homes, or worse: beaten, stoned, raped, or killed. The 86-page report, “Not Safe at Home: Violence and Discrimination Against LGBT People in Jamaica,” documents 56 cases of violence in which victims reported they were targeted because of their actual or perceived sexual identity. Human Rights Watch found that police investigations are often inadequate or lacking altogether, in some cases due to homophobia within the police force. \nIs the evil restricted to gay victims? According to CNN’s special segment with Anderson Cooper last week, Jamaica is home to a pandemic cottage industry called The Jamaican Lottery scam, which targets nearly 300,000 Americans a year, most of them elderly. The tiny island’s crooks are believed to be stealing at least $300 million yearly from innocent people using this scheme. The CNN news segment revealed “In Jamaica, more than 200 deaths a year have been tied to the scams. And in the United States, the scams have cost people their lives -- and their life savings.” Anderson Cooper interviewed the family of 81 year-old Albert Poland, who committed suicide after falling victim to the Jamaican fraud. The Jamaican was calling the Polands’ telephone up to 50 times a day to harass the senior into wiring more and more money. Virginia Poland, Albert's widow, said one time she answered the phone and in a moment of despair revealed to her husband's tormentor that Albert had killed himself. She said the man laughed in response. \n“I don’t trust Jamaicans,” said a travel agent at a seminar, this week, “I sent customers there and they were always ripped off. I recall one family purchased bags of supposed Jamaican coffee only to get home to discover the bags were filled with rocks!” Ripping off innocent people is rampant. The Jamaica Gleaner reported last year “A senior official in the banking sector has labelled fraud one of the few growth industries in Jamaica.” Peter E T Edwards, PhD is a Jamaican marine scientist, environmental economist and policy analyst; in one of his articles from the Jamaica Observer he called his country “Scandal Paradise,” referring to lack of transparency and little to no consequences for destroying an innocent person’s life. \nSo are the fraudsters low life thugs? Not necessarily. A few weeks ago, the Jamaica Observer reported physician Shaun Wynter of Kingston was caught registering a woman’s newborn baby as the offspring of another couple. Can you imagine your obstetrician taking your baby and giving it to someone else? What kind of scum of the earth does that? \nI have been in American airports several times when they brought out canine units to investigate all the luggage. It was unsettling, because I assumed it had something to do with explosives. I asked airport porters, information volunteers and similar airport employees why the canine search was happening, and each time I was told it was because of an inbound flight originating in Jamaica. Apparently they are notorious for smuggling illegal drugs and liquor. \nCitizens of the US can fly to the UK and enjoy a holiday for up to six months by simply presenting their passports. Britain got fed up with Jamaicans and their illegal immigration stunts, to the point it decided to bar all of them from entry unless they obtained visitor visas in advance. This is somewhat shocking considering Jamaica is a Commonwealth realm, with Queen Elizabeth II as its monarch and head of state. A documentary on National Geographic network showed how Jamaicans print fake visas then try to illegally enter the US. Apparently some of these people have no conscience whatsoever. \nI can’t see myself vacationing in Jamaica. I can’t understand why any American would go there when we have Hawaii. But to keep informed, I always pay attention to what tourists are saying about the island. Phenixburn wrote about his visit to Jamaica on VirtualTourist.com: \n…The problem with the authorities is they lie through their teeth to cover up anything involving tourists. …anyone who takes a cab ride from the airport to whatever hotel you are going to can tell you that there is a dark vibe about that place, a sense of \"anything can happen\" that is unsettling. In the first hour I was there I saw dead animals on the road, beggars, hookers, accidents and a general poverty everywhere. If you think that this culture is all loving and stress free, you are dead wrong. This is not to say that the people aren't nice, because I met so many friendly Jamaicans that it more than made up for the bad ones...but there are bad ones, I assure you. Two days ago I was at the YS Falls at about 3:30 PM, the place was busy, and the roads were quiet. Our tour bus was turning a corner when a white vehicle pulled out in front of us and hit the breaks to stop us at the bottom of the hill. Two men got out of the vehicle with guns, while the driver waved his gun out his window to reinforce that we had to cooperate. One man stepped on to the bus while the other stood outside it nervously. The man on the bus showed us his gun and asked for everything we had (thankfully I had nothing, not a cent). The tour guide peed herself, and for good reason, because she knew what the Jamaican people hide from us tourists; the dangers of this situation. She knew that this has happened before, that a driver was once beheaded while the other passengers were driven to a field robbed and executed. I just thought that this was a chill robbery to be honest, as the guy took a moment to shake all of our hands and say \"this is just business, just survival, one love\". After they left we drove to the police station where they insisted that this \"never\" happens, and you know that if you try to find any mention of it, they are right, it apparently never does. The reason why is simple, they don't print it. They hide it to protect tourism.” \nCan Jamaica Tourism officials be trusted? Well, a federal grand jury in New Haven, Conn. indicted Eric Anthony Abrahams, Jamaica's minister of tourism, over a $900,000 bribery scheme. After the scandal, Jamaicans continued to hail him as a pillar of the community. That doesn’t sound encouraging; neither does the outlook for interacting with everyday islanders. The United States Department of State issued its Jamaica 2015 Crime and Safety report; it warns Americans about some rather common threats in that country: Surveillance; Stolen items; Drug Trafficking; Murder; Theft; Burglary; Rape/Sexual Violence; Assault; Kidnapping; Financial Security; Fraud; Carjacking; Riots/Civil Unrest. \nCharmaine Rattray and her 19-year-old daughter Joyette Lynch were beheaded in Kingston, after a Jamaican gang decided it was time to send a message to its rival gang. There is a history of gangs murdering innocent people who merely live in the territory of their rivals, like wild animals having turf wars. Corey Robinson reported in the Jamaica Observer there was a week when four beheadings occurred within five days. He said a group of men kicked in the door of 37-year-old Gary Emanuel Smith and his two small children, dragged Smith 400 yards out of their house, and cut off his head after shooting him in the right leg. \nStudents at St. Jago school have been victim to several shootings when they were told to run for their lives. One day ten armed thugs came on to the property and shot up the place up for three hours. A news report of the incident was posted on YouTube, where Tat2edSinner wrote “D*mn Jamaica is a sh*t hole.” [edited for publication] \nIt’s not only the gangs who behave this way. In March this year, an angry mob stoned a young, allegedly gay man to death in Jamaica and filmed themselves hurling rocks at his head. The video went viral, but allegedly, the police just laughed about it and did nothing. In 2013, a teenager named Dwayne Jones was chopped and stabbed to death by a Jamaican mob for being gay, but no one was charged. In The Daily Kos earlier this year, Horace Boothroyd III urged world citizens and tourists to boycott Jamaica; he was disgusted by these lower than fecal matter mobs. Many travel agents and tourists are taking Boothroyd’s plea seriously, and boycotting the island to show this behavior must not be tolerated any longer. \nJamaica dumped its slogan “Jamaica – Once you go, you know” and replaced it with “Jamaica Get All Right.” The UK Guardian raised its eyebrows to the dodgy slogan (grammatically speaking), suggesting the country should at least try to sound educated. AnniePaul.com, in its Active Voice commentary on current events in Jamaica, wrote: \n“As an exhortation to the country itself it might work…for the Lord knows Jamaica does need to ‘get all right’. It [Jamaica] seems to be suffering from a malingering degenerative disease that we would all like it to snap out of. But as a slogan for tourists?” \nThe Pollyanna in me wants to believe this is just all one big cultural misunderstanding; perhaps the beheadings were some sort of societal struggle and we should embrace Jamaica on its own terms. I wanted so hard to believe I was wrong about all the bad things I heard about Jamaica, and give it a 24th chance (as Charlie Sheen would say). \nThe Jamaica Tourist Board announced they were holding a seminar in Detroit, and since it was close to home, I decided to go. There were a couple of screwy things I noticed at the seminar – one being that there were noticeable no-shows from certain tour operators. Were their reps boycotting Jamaica? At no time did the Jamaica Tourist Board address the giant elephant in the room: never-ending violence and vomit-inducing crime rates in the tiny nation. Ignoring the elephant was as imprudent as asking “Other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln?” \nAt the seminar, travel agents discussed among themselves hush-hush feuds going on in the travel world. For example, one of the major luxury wedding/honeymoon resort chains prominent in Jamaica had a falling out with a couple of large tour operators, and severed its relationships with them. The agents suggested we will never know the real reason why this happened, because so many business dealings play out in sneaky, underhanded maneuvers. Then there was Delta and Alaska Airlines feuding over the Seattle gateway, which led to Delta removing Alaska’s customer guest privileges from its Sky Lounge effective January 1st 2016. “You’re not welcome and we don’t want you in the room!” the airline seems to be saying. \nNow, have you ever walked into a room and felt the tension without even knowing what caused it? You can feel that uneasiness in the air, you can sense discord, but no one is talking? It’s such an awkward moment. I felt this vibe the minute I walked into the seminar. The tall, dark and well-dressed rep from the Jamaica Tourist Board was manning a table with name tags to give each agent, and he seemed angry about something. Was there some sort of nasty fight going on? Maybe not. He took our colorful business cards and placed them into the clear fish bowl; it would serve as the source for prize lotteries at the end of the evening. \nDinner was exceptional. The Detroit Yacht Club’s catering department never fails to impress. It is a gorgeous, restored 1920s Mediterranean-style villa situated on its own island. Friends arrived at the show before I did, so they chose my seat for me. I faced the name tag table and fish bowl all evening. \nDuring the dinner, the Delta Vacations rep sauntered up to the name tag table and it appeared she was pilfering business cards out of the lottery bowl. Surely my eyes were deceiving me. Would Delta Vacations remove travel agents’ business cards from of the bowl in the same way Delta is removing Alaska customers from its Sky Club? Except, in this case, unscrupulously? \nThe tour wholesalers in attendance gave out many prizes during the seminar. They promoted their company and drew a card from the lottery bowl so agents could win a box of spices or couple of nights hotel stay. As each company spoke, they shook the bowl to keep the cards mixed. I was only a few feet away from the speakers at that point, and noticed I only saw white cards in the bowl. Our agency’s cards were orange or green, but for 20 minutes of circumrotation I couldn’t see them. I smelled fraud. \nAfter the last prize was given out, the Jamaica rep set the bowl on a round table and walked away. I went to the bowl and turned it over. Sure enough, business cards from my travel agency had been removed. I saw the Jamaica rep place them in the bowl, I saw the Delta Vacations rep with her hands at the bowl, and now I saw the cards had been stolen. \nThe first thing I did was call travel agents to the bowl and show them our cards had been stolen. One agent remarked, “There were about 100 agents here tonight, but it appears a significant number of cards were pilfered from the bowl.” I wanted to make sure there were plenty of witnesses to the pilfering in case Delta or the Jamaica rep called me a liar. I told the agents I saw the Delta Vacations rep with her hands at the bowl before the drawings. \n“She may have not had any idea what she was doing,” said one agent, “because you know how much she loves her refreshments.” She could have been totally innocent. \nI believe a conscientious employee of Delta would have avoided all appearances of fraud and kept away from the lottery bowl. \nI went to the Jamaica rep and objected to our cards being removed from the bowl, since he was the one who had placed them there. He grabbed the bowl from my hand and took it to his storage area and placed it behind a table cloth. \nI followed him and picked it up again and told him this pilfering was appalling. Well, if he wasn’t angry when I first came in the room, he certainly was angry now. \nAgents watching the Jamaican remarked, “You know, if he wanted to appear above-board, he would have said there must be some sort of mistake, and poured out the cards and tried to find your business cards in the bowl. The fact that he tried to suppress the issue gives the appearance he knew all along that the contest was rigged.” \nIs fixing a contest unlawful? In the 1950s there were many quiz show scandals. Organizers of The $64,000 Question, Twenty One and Dotto rigged their contests, which led Congress to enact 47 U.S. Code section 509 - Prohibited practices in contests of knowledge, skill, or chance. The law made contest rigging a felony. \nWould an official from the Jamaica Tourist Board knowingly commit fraud? Well, it happened before, perpetrated by Jamaica's minister of tourism. \nWould the Michigan Delta Vacations rep intentionally try to hurt me by eliminating me from the drawing? After I wrote about her nasty behavior in my October 8 article, she did have a motive to neglect professional protocol and retaliate. She has been a bully toward me for the last year or so; it began after I broke a scandal about her friend, Stacey Martin Alford, who once was the Director of Travel Industry Sales at Oahu Visitors Bureau. \nI would love to believe that Delta remains the same, honorable and gracious company it was before its merger. The Delta Vacations rep is not an original Delta employee, she came with the merger. “Like inheriting a mother in law when you get married,” said a travel agent at the seminar. \n“You participated in a Jamaican lottery but didn’t expect it to be a scam?” asked one the travel agents who witnessed the incident. “If I counted correctly, a lot of travel agents have been defrauded by having cards removed from the bowl,” said another observer. “This crosses the line,” said another. \nJamaican resident Carlton Reynolds summed it up in just a few words in his letter to the Jamaica Observer last year, “What a horrible place, what a horrible and vile people we have become!” By Dr. Anton Anderssen, special to eTN | Oct 24, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:51:39.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
