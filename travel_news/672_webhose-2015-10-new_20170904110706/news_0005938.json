The trend is similar to what previous reports from the authority on the used commercial truck market noted in the first half of 2015.\nWhen asked about commercial truck retail figures, Chris Visser , senior analyst at NADA Official Commercial Truck Guide®, said, \"Sleeper tractors retailed through August of 2015 are averaging 4.7 percent less mileage than in the same period of 2014.\"\nVisser went on to say, \"Average age is nearly identical, so buyers are cherry-picking the lowest-mileage units.\"\nThe monthly analysis report from NADA Used Car Guide also includes a special section, which addresses the question, \"How might the Environmental Protection Agency's Phase 2 emission and economy standards affect the new and used commercial truck market, given current concept trucks don't meet the proposed standards?\"\nDownload the Free Report\nThe full 2015 October Guidelines report can be downloaded for free on the NADA Used Car Guide® website at www.nada.com/b2b .\nAbout NADA Used Car Guide\nSince 1933, NADA Used Car Guide ® has earned its reputation as the leading provider of vehicle valuation products, services and information to businesses throughout the United States and worldwide.
