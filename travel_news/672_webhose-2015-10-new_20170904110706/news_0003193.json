In Germany there are three Wadden Sea national parks, in Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and Hamburg, whose richly varied natural landscapes are just waiting to be discovered. The mudflats of the North Sea islands and the Hallig islands are a must-see, and at low tide you can even reach them on foot.\nThe Wadden Sea (Wattenmeer) on the North Sea coast is a unique habitat for many rare species of flora and fauna. Now with the addition of a state-of-the-art visitor centre on Sahlenburg beach in Cuxhaven, you can learn all about this special ecosystem through a variety of installations and exhibitions.The most memorable way to discover the Wadden Sea is undoubtedly on a guided walking tour of the mudflats, which can be booked at the visitor centre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:46:09.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
