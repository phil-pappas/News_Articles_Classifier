According to data from Bibby Financial Services, one-third of UK companies consider themselves “adventurous”. Is this a healthy ratio for a growing economy? Of course, adventurousness is relative: it depends on what else you know. However, James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, notes two “hard data points”, the first being that entrepreneurial activity has doubled in Britain. It now involves 15pc of the working population, up from 7pc in 2002. Risk-takers should be sufficiently widespread not to cause alarm, but not so widespread that nothing gets done However, while Britain leads the EU in entrepreneurialism, the EU is the world’s “least entrepreneurial” economy. Britain historically lags the US “by a factor of one third”. The second data point is about the distribution of adventurousness in society. There is an “explorer gene” that identifies those predisposed to taking risks. This gene occurs in 15 to 20pc of the population. The theory is that this range is key to economic success: if more than 20 pc of a population are explorers all you get are blue sky and hot air; less and the explorer may be ostracised. For risk-taking to be effective, “risk-takers should be sufficiently widespread not to cause alarm, but not so widespread that nothing gets done.” Mr Sproule says simply taking risks is only half the challenge of running a successful business. “It’s not all about start-ups. You find entrepreneurs in large companies. They add value by challenging the status quo. What matters is how responsive those hierarchies are.” Perhaps the real challenge for British business is not just to think about taking a more adventurous approach, but to act But 15 to 20pc may not be the golden ratio. The explorer gene is uniformly distributed but economic vitality isn’t. “Some countries are far more entrepreneurial than Britain or the US. But that’s because in places like sub-Saharan Africa there are no other options: you’re either an entrepreneur or unemployed,” says Mr Sproule. We don’t know what would happen to a society long or short on the explorer gene, since no such society exists. What we do know is that there is a disparity between the alleged 15 to 20pc of explorer-gene carriers, and the one-third of respondents who think they are adventurous. Perhaps the real challenge for British business is not just to think about taking a more adventurous approach, but to act. • To find out how Bibby supports 7,000 UK businesses, visit www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:45:12.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
