SUPPLIED \nHuman Postcards creators Arie Van Der Poel and Nora Jaccaud. \nThey started their tour of New Zealand in February from Whataroa and their first stops were Wanaka, Queenstown, Milford Sounds and Stewart Island. \n\"We had this idea to travel with a meaningful project that would allow us to go and talk with strangers and pay homage to them by interviewing them and filming them in their daily lives or work and capture something special about them,\" Jaccaud said. \nThe series features Stewart Islanders including South Sea Hotel quiz mistress Vicki Coats, whose uncompromising style received international attention when Prince Harry visited the island in May. HUMAN POSTCARDS/YouTube \nOnce a technical drawer who designed navy submarines, Boris now works in the world's southernmost fish and chip shop. \nAnother clip tells the story of a fry cook named Boris, who traded a career designing navy submarines for a job in the world's southernmost fish and chip shop. \nThe idea was born when Jaccaud saw a sandwich man standing at the corner of Regent and Oxford streets in London. HUMAN POSTCARDS/YouTube \nJohn worked in the forest industry for 42 years. Since retiring, John has been seeking new challenges and recently competed in the annual woodchopping competition at the South Westland A&P show alongside world champion axeman Adam Lowe and others half his age. \nShe noticed the man standing in the middle of a crowd and not being noticed by anyone, almost invisible, which inspired her to find out what his story was. Ad Feedback \nJaccaud was an experienced filmmaker who had produced a number of shorts and had worked on projects in the United States and Europe and Van Der Poel was a sound engineer and producer. \nVan Der Poel was born in Greymouth and raised between Whataroa, on the West Coast, and Christchurch. HUMAN POSTCARDS/YouTube \nJust like his creations, Blair from the Catlins reminds us to listen to the child within us. \nHe moved to Europe five years ago and found work, ending up in London where he met Jaccaud . \nApproaching people with an open mind and genuine curiosity as to what they are up to was really important, Jaccaud said. \n\"We live in a world where we don't have many opportunities to speak in a deep way about our existence and what we think of the world and things that have happened in our lives, especially with strangers where there is no judgement.\" \nWhen they approached people with a genuine interest most were happy to share their stories, Van Der Poel said. \nThey had almost no refusals, Jaccaud said. \nOne postcard Van Der Poel remembered was a man named John in Whataroa, who they interviewed right after he won his heat in a woodchopping competition at the South Westland A&P show. \n\"We pulled him away and threw him in his ute and we just had a really quick interview.\" \nHe was puffing and panting while the couple quizzed him about life, they said \n\"We asked him questions people would not dare to ask him as how is it to be the oldest man in this competition are you afraid of death,\" Jaccaud said. \nHe had so much adrenaline in his blood he answered the questions with complete honesty, they said. \nThe time that wasn't devoured by the videos was spent keeping up their social media presence trying to get people to watch the films, Van Der Poel said. \nThe couple were in France at the moment where they were in talks to possibly cover the refugee camps there and produce stories, Van Der Poel said. \n\"We're definitely planning in the future to come back to New Zealand and do another tour but kind of get people involved before hand . \nThe pair had just learnt that they have been nominated as a finalist for the Best Web Show at the NZ Web Fest awards to be held on November 7 in Auckland. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:52:13.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
