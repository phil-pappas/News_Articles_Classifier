Legend has it this city got its name from the workers who toiled to build Henry Flagler's railroad through the Keys.\nThe work, they said, was a real marathon.\nThe name stuck and today the 26-kilometer series of islands is one of the most family friendly strips in south Florida.\nAt The Turtle Hospital, kids (and adults) can go behind the scenes at the world's first licensed veterinary hospital for sea turtles and feed snacks to Bubble Butt, Rebel and Chance, a few of the hospital's permanent residents.\nSixteen kilometers up the road at the Dolphin Research Center in Grassy Key, visitors can kiss and shake hands with one of the center's 27 dolphins, some of which are direct descendants of the aquatic actors in the first \"Flipper\" movie.\nKids can also hug a sea lion, assist with research studies and learn how the center's trainers use hand signals to communicate with the dolphins.\n\"Most of our dolphins have grown up here,\" says Mary Stella, director of media and marketing at the Dolphin Research Center. \"They're used to people being part of their tribe.\"\nDolphin Research Center; entry $28 for adults, $23 for children. Additional programs cost extra.\nTurtle Hospital; entry $18 for adults, $9 for children.

This string of islands scattered between Florida Bay and the Atlantic Ocean has earned the nickname \"the sport fishing capital of the world.\"\nAs it travels north, the Gulf Stream brings a steady flow of sailfish, tuna and kingfish past the waiting hooks of Islamorada's anglers.\nThe waters of the back country -- located practically across the street -- teem with mullet, tarpon and trout.\n\"On a scale of one to 10, the fishing here is 9.5 year round,\" says Captain Skip Bradeen, who's led fishing charters off the coast of Islamorada for more than 50 years.\n\"There's diversification throughout the area, whether it's in the back country or just offshore. On one side of the road you're catching big game, on the other side you're catching little game.\"\nIslamorada is also coming into its own as a foodie destination.\nLocal chefs, and transplants from nearby Miami and far-off Napa Valley, work their magic on the day's catch.\nAn island-inspired SunSessional IPA or Hogfish Amber from Islamorada's new Florida Keys Brewing Co. are an excellent way to round out a meal.\nBlue Chip Too Charters , Whale Harbor Marina, Mile Marker 84, Oceanside, Islamorada, FL;\nFlorida Keys Brewing Company , 200 Morada Way, Islamorada, FL 33036;\nKey Largo\nSpiegel Grove, a retired Navy landing ship dock that's sunk off Key Largo, is open to divers. While there are plenty of things to do on land in the northernmost Florida Key, the best sites are found just below the waterline.\nKey Largo is one of the world's top spots for divers.\nA few kilometers offshore the sandy bottom is dotted with natural and man-made reefs and the skeletons of historic shipwrecks.\nDivers can explore the sunken hulls of British freighters, steam engines and rescue ships, and give a high-five to the upturned arms of the Christ of the Abyss statue.\nJules' Undersea Lodge is the self-proclaimed world's first underwater hotel.\nAfter checking in, guests dive 8.5 meters to their rooms.\nThe former research lab features two bedrooms each with a meter-wide portal where you can watch grouper, snapper and the occasional manatee pass through the lagoon.\nThe highlight of the stay is having a pizza -- or a lobster dinner -- delivered to the room by scuba diver.\nJules Undersea Lodge Dive and Snorkeling , 51 Shoreland Drive Mile Marker 103.2, Key Largo, FL 33037;", "external_links": ["http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34346-d3673427-Reviews-m14631-Blue_Chip_Too_Charters-Islamorada_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151005124651-florida-keys-11-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918121358-04-florida-keys-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151005124651-florida-keys-11-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918121358-04-florida-keys-small-169.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/videos/2015/09/24/Florida1.webm", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34346-d7729089-Reviews-m14631-Florida_Keys_Brewing_Company-Islamorada_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34344-d5535108-Reviews-m14631-Jules_Undersea_Lodge_Dive_and_Snorkeling-Key_Largo_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g34085-d514067-Reviews-m14631-No_Name_Pub-Big_Pine_Key_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34347-d552879-Reviews-m14631-Dolphin_Research_Center-Marathon_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918133137-10-florida-keys-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918121358-04-florida-keys-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918121358-04-florida-keys-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918121358-04-florida-keys-super-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g34347-d543369-Reviews-m14631-The_Turtle_Hospital-Marathon_Florida_Keys_Florida.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918133137-10-florida-keys-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918121358-04-florida-keys-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/videos/2015/09/24/Florida1.mp4", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918133137-10-florida-keys-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918133137-10-florida-keys-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151005124651-florida-keys-11-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918133137-10-florida-keys-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151005124651-florida-keys-11-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151005124651-florida-keys-11-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/23/florida-map-large.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918133137-10-florida-keys-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918133137-10-florida-keys-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151005124651-florida-keys-11-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151005124651-florida-keys-11-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150918121358-04-florida-keys-large-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:52:25.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
