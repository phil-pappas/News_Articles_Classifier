Share your favorite El Salvador food! \nBreakfast in El Salvador: \nEl Salvador breakfasts typically include an assortment of El Salvador food, such as eggs scrambled with vegetables (huevos picados), cheese, fried plantains (platanos fritos), mashed beans and tortillas. Fresh tropical fruits like mango, pineapple and banana are a welcome accompaniment. \nEl Salvador Meals: \nBecause El Salvador boasts an extensive coastline, seafood is a common ingredient in El Salvador cuisine. Soups (sopas) and stews (caldos) are extremely popular in El Salvador, especially sopa de pata, a mix of... well, see below. \nOther El Salvador meals: \nPupusas : thick corn tortillas stuffed with cheese, meat, squash, and/or other fillings. \nEmpanadas : flour pastries filled with meat, potatoes and/or cheese. In El Salvador, \"empanadas\" can also refer to a dessert: fried plantains stuffed with sweet cream. \nTamales : boiled pockets of corn dough, stuffed with meat or sweet corn and served in banana leaves. \nSopa de Pata : a popular soup made from corn, plantains, tripe and cow's feet. \nSnacks & Sides in El Salvador: \nYuca frita : fried yucca, often served with chicharon (deep-friend pork cracklings). \nPacalla : palm flowers breaded in cornmeal, fried and served with tomato sauce. \nCurtido : a spicy, vinegar-based condiment made from cabbage, carrots and other veggies. Much like sauerkraut. \nEl Salvador Desserts: \nTres Leches Cake (Pastel de Tres Leches ): A cake soaked in three kinds of milk, including evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk and cream. \nPastelitos: pasty turnovers, stuffed with sweets like custard, jam or caramelized fruit. \nSemita: coffee cake with guava or pineapple jam. \nBeverages in El Salvador: \nThe most popular El Salvador beer is Pilsener. Characteristic non-alcoholic beverages in El Salvador include Kolachampan, a sugarcane-flavored soda; tamarind juice; horchata, a sweet herb and spice-based El Salvador drink; and ensalada (\"salad\"), a drinkable blend of finely chopped tropical fruits. \nWhere to Eat & What You'll Pay: \nWhen it comes to authentic El Salvador food, El Salvador makes it easy. The best place to get a quality El Salvador pupusa ? A pupuseria , of course! What about a Pastelito? A pasteleria! Other great (and extremely inexpensive) places to try El Salvador food are street carts and open air markets. If you're not on a budget, there are plenty of mid-range to upmarket restaurants in big cities like San Salvador, and in El Salvador's touristy coastal regions. \nEl Salvador food is varied, delicious, and fast in its own right. However, U.S. citizens hungry for American fast food can find it in restaurant franchises like Pizza Hut, Burger King, Wendy's and Subway populating El Salvador's largest cities. In turn, pupuserias and other El Salvador restaurants are cropping up in the U.S. I enjoyed a fantastic lunch of sweet corn tamales, squash blossom pupusas, and fried yucca at a tiny restaurant in San Francisco. Better than a Big Mac, that's for sure! \nTry El Salvador Food in El Salvador: \nCompare rates on flights to San Salvador, El Salvador Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:34:57.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
