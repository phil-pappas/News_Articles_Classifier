Dora, Florida. © Dawn Henthorn, licensed to About.com \nA corn maze just might be the last thing you would expect to crop up in Florida, but each fall that's exactly what happens about 30 miles northwest of Orlando. Each fall the ancient art form is reborn by Long & Scott Farms in Mount Dora. A different adventure is carefully crafted with the cornstalks as a backdrop for a themed experience that is different every year. It's fun to get lost in the acres of corn stalks as you follow the pathways of the maze, find pictures, clues and games to make learning fun. \nThe seven-acre corn field isn't just a walk in the stalks... it is a real adventure where you or a group work together or compete as teams to find your way. Finding the clues in the corn is made interesting with multiple choices on every pathway. There is something new to find and a decision to make around every corner. It's great fun! \nIn addition, Scott's have added new additions this year, including a jumping pillow.
