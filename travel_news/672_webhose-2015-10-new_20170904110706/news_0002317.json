This is for all the Farmers in Zimbabwe & South Africa that have been murdered! and the world did nothing. \nHistory and the treatment of citizens immaterial of colour, ethnic origin, religious beliefs or political affiliation is something Ministers of Tourism need to remain aware will haunt them as they try to promote their countries across the world. Today it is sustainable tourism that has become the buzz word, but sustainable tourism is too often limited to protection of the environment but now more and often the call for protection of people is being included as a key element for a complete sustainable tourism approach. \nA post this week of Facebook highlights this concept. Ghosts of farmers from Zimbabwe and South Africa who were murdered are speaking up. The attention of Cecil the Lion from Zimbabwe killed by a licensed hunter is reference to the long list of white farmers murdered by State apparatus in war was called land matters. \nSustainable tourism cannot be discussed until closure of such traumatic years are discussed and it is Tourism Ministers who need to come out to speak up about any abuses that have taken place in their countries. Zimbabwe still has the same President and its same Minister of Tourism whereas in South Africa both the President and the Minister of Tourism have changed in a democratic elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:58:40.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
