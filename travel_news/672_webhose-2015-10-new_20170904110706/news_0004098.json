Today, as part of an ongoing series organised by Canon and the Telegraph, which partners business gurus with SME owners for a mentoring session, Mr King sits down with Alex Bodini of Fixation London to offer him an invaluable lesson on business growth. Fixation London is still in its infancy. It has been trading in fashionable bikes for urbanites since January, and set up a shop in Covent Garden in May. The brand puts style at the forefront of the market and has been well received by city workers investing in alternative travel. “A bicycle is no longer simply a mode of transport; it is an extension of one’s style,” says Mr Bodini, “so our aim is to make stylish fixed-gear bikes accessible to fashionable professionals.” The brand has harvested more than 22,000 followers on Instagram since its conception and has experimented with a YouTube channel. Mr Bodini, who comes from a marketing background, knows how to use the internet as a means to gaining a reputable reputation. The biggest obstacle Mr Bodini is facing, however, is that the profit margin on his bikes is small. Bikes are also awkward to ship and consumers rarely buy one if they haven’t given it a test drive first. “To survive solely on bikes is limiting. But there’s an open goal in the gifting space for a cool bike brand to come in and sell gift products,” Mr Bodini says of their growth strategy. You want to get to a brand stamp. You want to get to a logo that acts like the Nike swoosh Mr King advises that before Fixation offers new products to the market, it must find singularity in its identity. “Focus with an unerring style attack on the word ‘purity’,” says Mr King. “You can start to build out Fixation’s raison d'être from focusing on this one word. “We live in a world of impurities. The type of bike you’re selling has purity in form and function. The next word on from purity is high-quality. Pure gold is high-quality. Pure water is high-quality.” Mr Bodini agrees this would suit the brand; the shop isn’t cluttered with stock and the stripped-back interior is raw to the point of being pure. Now Fixation must mirror this in its badge of identity. The business’s logo was crowdsourced, but Mr King doesn’t feel it works hard enough to identify the brand. “Your logo should have something that links back to the Fixation heritage,” he says. “You want to get to a brand stamp. You want to get to a logo that acts like the Nike swoosh, then build your gift products around it.” He reassures Mr Bodini that it took him five years to finalise the King of Shaves logo. Mr King advises that this kind of singularity can be transferrable to managing staff. Fixation London only has two members of staff: Mr Bodini as founder, innovator and strategy manager, and a part-time worker, Ralph, who straddles both sales and operations. Embrace change. When it comes to your website, printers and computers, you’ve got to keep moving on up or you’ll get left behind “It’s important that Ralph does what he’s best at and you do what you’re best at,” recommends Mr King. “Ask him what he loves doing and let him do it. If you push people into doing what they don’t want to do they won’t do it well. “Imagine it as if you are the axis, then you need someone straddling sales and marketing, another person straddling innovation and production, and one person just looking after finance.” However, there isn’t a budget to take on another person until next February. As for the current part-time employee, Mr Bodini explains: “The idea is very much to offer him equity after a review period, and he knows that’s the plan.” Mr King agrees this is the best approach: “People like the feeling of being a shareholder, and being a quasiboss. When Andy Hill joined King of Shaves in the early Nineties, he was on £7,000 a year, then within four years it went up to £60,000. But he also had shares in the company, which quickly became worth about a million. That’s why after 20 years he’s still rolling with me and is now CEO of the company.” In that time, Mr King set the vanguard of innovation in men’s grooming. Mr Bodini asks him if he feels innovation is key to building a valuable business. “You’ve got to keep on the cutting edge of everything as much as you can,” says Mr King. “Embrace change. When it comes to your website, printers and computers, you’ve got to keep moving on up or you’ll get left behind and wonder why no one is talking to you.” • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:44:21.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
