Beginning November 26 and running through April 17, skiers will be donning lift tickets designed with dizzying prints by the fashion-favorite artist Takashi Murakami . Revealed exclusively on Vogue.com, the psychedelic tickets, available to all visitors for entry onto the mountains, feature Murakami’s signature Japanese graphic art: Pop-inspired cartoon characters like a dog on a hilltop, mouse-eared faces, and his familiar collage of colorful smiling flowers.\nMurakami was commissioned to create the tickets this season in honor of the 10th anniversary of Aspen’s Art in Unexpected Places , a partnership between the Aspen Skiing Company and the Aspen Art Museum that brings contemporary art to the public in unusual contexts. In addition to the artist-designed lift tickets (past seasons’ tickets have included work by Jim Hodges and Karen Kilimnik ), the program has also produced outdoor performances and installations on and around the mountains.\nMurakami’s personal relationship with the Aspen Art Museum began back in February, when his film Jellyfish Eyes screened there, though he had been aware of the local art scene for the past several years. “I first learned of the name Aspen when I learned of the solo exhibition Mark Grotjahn held at the museum,” Murakami says. “I like the way it sounds when spoken aloud and thought it was a fine name for a town.”\nSo will the artist actually be hitting the slopes anytime soon? “In the future, I’d like to go to Aspen with my sketchbook and sketch the snow-covered mountains there.” We’d venture a guess that his version of fresh powder would have a crazy tint to it.", "external_links": ["https://www.aspensnowmass.com/we-are-different/art-in-unexpected-places"], "published": "2015-10-07T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:04:24.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
