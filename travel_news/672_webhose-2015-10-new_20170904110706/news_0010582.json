Popular Stories   \nAUSSIES are being invited to bid for the final six trips through an eBay auction where all proceeds will be donated to Reef Check Australia and their launch of a new network on the Capricorn Coast. \nThe XXXX Island charity auction will go live on www.ebay.com.au at 2pm AEST today (on Friday, October 2) and bids on the 29 items up for grabs will open until 1pm AEST on Monday, October 12. \nOther items up for grabs include the iconic loo-with-a-view, 19th hole tinnie and the famous beer delivery pulley system. \nSince welcoming the first visitors ashore in 2012, XXXX Island has given more than 3,000 Aussies the chance to kick back; catching the fish of the day, enjoying a BBQ, or reconnecting with mates over a beer or two on the idyllic southern Great Barrier Reef. \nJack Mesley, XXXX Marketing Manager at Lion, said that the charity auction will allow the memory of XXXX Island to live on in the hearts and homes of people all around Australia, as well as support a worthy cause. \n\"Every item has been carefully selected because of the role it has played in helping people enjoy the simple pleasures in life such as the much loved Aussie lifestyle, the outdoors, the sun, some beers and great mates. \n\"We've got a bit of everything from signed sports memorabilia to the popular Beer Delivery Pull System and even our beloved Quintrex 420 Open Dory tinnie. It's hard to put a price on the XXXX Island loo-with-a-view but the winning bidder will join the more than 3,000 people who have been able to soak up the stunning vista from inside its lovingly crafted structure. Future bidders might be pleased to know that we've retired the old toilet and are throwing in a new one! \n\"But it's the final six trips ever to XXXX Island, where the winning bidder can also take three mates, which will no doubt be the hottest items in the auction. If it's your dream to get to XXXX Island, now is the time to rally your mates, raid your coin jars, look under your couch cushions for loose change and pool together a winning bid,\" said Mesley. \nMesley said that Reef Check Australia have been chosen as the charity partner because of XXXX's commitment to supporting marine conservation efforts around Australia. \n\"Holding this auction and donating every dollar raised supports our core promise to leave XXXX Island and the surrounding region in a better place. Through our partnership with Reef Check Australia, we can now extend this commitment to coastlines around Australia. \n\"We're lucky in Australian to have unfettered access to nature's landscape and being able to enjoy spending time with friends and family in the great Aussie outdoors. But it's important that we do everything we can to ensure its protection so it can be enjoyed by future generations and we truly believe that Reef Check Australia is doing great things to help achieve this through the protection of our marine environment,\" said Mesley. \nJennifer Loder, General Manager of Reef Check Australia, said they are thrilled to be chosen as the charity partner because it will help them to continue their work in building community capacity to support healthy coasts and oceans for everyone to enjoy. \n\"Funds raised will help us to join forces with local partners to build a new Reef Check network on the beautiful Capricorn Coast and strengthen programs for hands-on citizen science, education and local action across Australia,\" said Loder. \nBidders on all items must be aged 18+.
