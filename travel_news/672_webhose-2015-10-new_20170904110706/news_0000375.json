He took a seat on the bench, and was visibly shaken by the injury, holding his head in his hands as teammates tried to console him.\nHe was taken back to the locker room shortly after and at halftime was ruled out to return.\nThe Broncos already are without starting outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, who was ruled out Friday with a back injury.\nShaquil Barrett started in place of Ware, but the latest injury leaves Lerentee McCray as the lone backup for Barrett and Von Miller.\nStay tuned for updates on Ray's injury.\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:05:32.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
