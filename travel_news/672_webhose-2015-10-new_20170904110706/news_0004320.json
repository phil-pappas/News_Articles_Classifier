Lauderdale \nAt Louie Bossi’s Ristorante, Bar and Pizzeria everything is made from scratch using fresh and local ingredients and authentic Italian flair. By Brenda Benoit \nWe started our meal at Louie Bossi’s Ristorante, Bar and Pizzeria with the Salumi Assortito – A medley of homemade salumi (cured meats that are sliced and served as an appetizer), cheeses, fresh and dried fruits, olive bread complemented with almonds and honey. All on the platter was truly fantastic and plentiful, a generous serving indeed. \nThe Pizza Margherita D.O.P. was made with ?mozzarella di bufala, basil, extra virgin olive oil and sea salt. The flavors were really distinct and blended together in perfect harmony. \nNext, the Linguine with clams was just a gorgeous plate of pasta with clams and white wine, gently drizzled with parsley. This dish really embodied the true spirit of comfort food. \nAnybody who knows me is aware that I am an authentic meat lover. The New York Strip (Bistecca) was dry aged in house and was stupendous! Served with roasted garlic and rosemary it was juicy and bloody delicious: just the way I like it. A veritable indulgence. \nChef Louie Bossi hails from New York and was raised by a single mother. He taught himself to cook at the age of eight. He moved to Florida in 2000 and fell in love with the area. \nLouie has a special love for pizza and became a Master Pizza Maker from the Scoula Italiana Pizzaoili. His love for food does not stop with pizza – he sources local pork for his house-made charcuterie and creates different styles of cured and smoked meats. \nThe outdoor courtyard at Louie Bossi’s is really lovely and welcoming; the indoor décor is simply elegant but not stuffy. The food on the menu is made from scratch and includes 14 different pastas, house made salumi, dry-aged steaks, gelato, breads, Neopolitan pizzas and lemoncello (an Italian lemon liqueur). They serve lunch and dinner daily, as well as brunch on weekends. \nLouie Bossi’s Ristorante, Bar & Pizzeria 1032 East Las Olas Boulevard Downtown Fort Lauderdale", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:53:27.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
