THIS 18-year-old photographer is braving dizzying heights - and arrest - to capture vertigo-inducing snaps from NYC skyscrapers PUBLISHED: 11:05, Fri, Oct 16, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:12, Fri, Oct 16, 2015 CATERS One brave man scaled the ever-famous NYC skyline to take some spectacular pictures \nThis 18 year old photographer is braving dizzying heights - and arrest - to capture vertigo-inducing snaps from NYC skyscrapers. \nThe world-famous NYC skyline provides the backdrop for thousands of Hollywood films - but what about the dizzying views from atop those much-loved skyscrapers? Related articles London's tourism industry is booming according to new figures \nDaredevil German tourist Andrej Ciesielski captured just that with these vertigo-inducing snaps. \nTaken on a 'roofing' expedition, Andrej scaled giddying heights to capture the NYC cityscape in both day and night. CATERS Daredevil German tourist Andrej Ciesielski took himself to the top of the tallest buildings in NYC CATERS This view of the skyline by day is simply spectacular \n\"New York is just amazing for roofing,\" said 18 year old Andrej. \"Since I started roofing I always wanted to visit New York City - I'm a big fan of the architecture.\" \nThe expedition, which took Andrej around 20 minutes, isn't for your average amateur photographer, though - and not only because of the dizzying heights. It's also an arrestable offence. \n\"Before you enter a building you always think about the police and what the consequences might be,\" said Andrej. CATERS Andrej claims he takes everything into consideration before climbing to the highest heights \n\"We knew that many people had been caught on this rooftop. When you climb you are always afraid that cars can see you, but everything went well.\" \nAsked if he'd return for more Manhattan roofing from high up on the top of the concrete jungle's landmarks, Andrej said \"I enjoyed New York but I wouldn't go there again for roofing - only for visiting like a normal tourist.\" \nLooks like if you want more of these stunning scenes from across the Big Apple you'll have some work to do.
