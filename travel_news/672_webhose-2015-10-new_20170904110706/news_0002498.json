Iran an ally of the Syrian government says it has advisory missions in the country but no military forces. \nDaesh is now within 2 km of government-held territory on Aleppo's northern edge the closest they have been to the city. \nDaesh said its fighters had captured five villages in its offensive and killed \"more than 10 apostates\" a term it uses to describe Syrian soldiers. \nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was the biggest advance by Daesh since it launched an offensive against rebels in the northern Aleppo countryside near the Turkish border in late August. \nRussian jets and warships have been bombarding targets across Syria for 10 days in a campaign which Moscow says is targeting Daesh. \nBut the campaign appears to have mainly struck other rebel groups some of which had been battling to stop Daesh advance across Aleppo province. One of those groups Liwa Suqour Al-Jabal said the Russian strikes destroyed their main weapons depot. \nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps said one of its generals Hossein Hamedani had been killed near Aleppo late on Thursday. Hamedani was a veteran of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and was made deputy chief commander of the elite forces in 2005. \nIranian lawmaker Esmail Kosari said Hamedani had played an important role preventing rebel fighters seizing the capital Damascus earlier in Syria's conflict and had returned for a few days because of his deep knowledge of the country. \nMeanwhile the US has indications that four Russian cruise missiles crashed in Iran rather than Syria suggesting there were malfunctions Defense Secretary Ash Carter confirmed Friday. \nCarter spoke at a press conference in London with British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon. It was the first public comment by a US official on the cruise missile failures. \nRussia fired a total of 26 of the long-range missiles at Syrian targets. The officials said it's unclear whether the errant missiles launched from Russian ships in the Caspian Sea caused any significant damage in Iran. Both the Russian government and state-run Iranian media accused the United States of inaccurate or deliberately deceptive statements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:38:17.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
