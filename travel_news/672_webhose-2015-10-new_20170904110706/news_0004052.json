The award honors Convention & Visitors Bureaus (CVBs) that have excelled in professionalism and dedication in service to meeting planner professionals. This is the 22nd time that Visit Anchorage has won the award. The first year Visit Anchorage won was in 1993, and then every year consecutively since 1995. \n“The success of this story really comes from decades of relationship building with meeting planners, our members, and the city,” says Julie Dodds, Director of Convention Sales. “During my tenure I have watched sales double. In 2015 we will likely reach $100 million in estimated economic impact in meetings and conventions held in Anchorage.” \n“Part of this legacy comes from the addition of the Dena’ina Civic and Convention Center,” Dodds says. “Since the building opened in September 2008, more than 1 million people have passed through its doors. It is the one asset, outside of our staff, that has allowed our city to flourish.” \nThrough unaided recall, meeting planners voted for the top convention and visitors bureaus throughout the world and selected Visit Anchorage as one of the best. The publication boasts more than 50,000 subscribers. \nSubscribers awarded 81 domestic and 16 international CVBs and tourism boards with the Gold Service Award this year. Selection was based on the organizations’ extensive industry experience in both corporate and association markets. Key criteria included: professionalism of staff; support during hotels and site inspections; assistance with ground transportation planning; guidance on local attractions; and liaison with local venders and services. \n“All our Gold Service winning CVBs know the value of creating a lasting impression can never be understated,” said David Blansfield, Executive Vice President/Group Publisher, Northstar Meeting Group. \nWinners will be featured in Meetings & Conventions’ Gold Awards issue published this November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:16:01.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
