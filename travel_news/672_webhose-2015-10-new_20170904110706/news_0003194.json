FACEBOOK \nMatt Keith says locals forced him to write an apology letter. \nKeith said he had studied in a school in southern India some years ago. \"I love India, which is why we came back to visit,\" he said. \n\"We have heard about the growing Hindu nationalism, but nothing justifies the way we were treated. I love Hinduism,\" he said. \nIndia has seen a rise in incidents of religious intolerance over the past year, with Hindu nationalists trying to create a more Hindu-centric country. \nKeith said he also had a tattoo of the elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesha on his back. \nKeith, who studied law at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, said he did not think he had done anything wrong. \n\"I should not have to apologise for what is on my skin and be put in a traumatising situation where it is apparently acceptable to be harassed, threatened and mobbed,\" he said. \nBangalore's deputy commissioner of police, Sandeep Patil, that an inquiry had been ordered into the incident and its handling by local police. \"If police forced the couple to give an apology, it is a serious matter,\" Patil said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:33:07.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
