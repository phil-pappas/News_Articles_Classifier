The mayor, Anne Hidalgo , confirmed this week that a long section of the Georges Pompidou expressway on the Right Bank of the Seine will be permanently closed to traffic from next summer. The move has rekindled controversy over the city’s “anti-car” policies, with the Medef employer’s federation complaining that it will harm the capital’s economy. Residents of suburbs and towns surrounding Paris accused “well-heeled” Parisians of trying to create a comfortable “bubble” for themselves without heeding the needs of the region as a whole. “This is a particularly selfish decision,” said Valérie Pécresse, a centre-Right MP whose Yvelines constituency includes the prosperous commuter town of Versailles, just outside Paris.

Ms Hidalgo, a Socialist, said her aim was to “dissuade” people from using cars in Paris. Fewer than half of the capital’s residents own cars, but pollution often reaches alarming levels in the densely built-up inner city, which she argues is well served by the Métro, buses and taxis. However, public transport between suburbs and the city are less dependable and massively overcrowded at peak times. Other measures to limit pollution in Paris include a ban on lorries made before 2001 , which was introduced in July, a 30 kilometre-per-hour (18 mph) speed limit to come into effect in a third of the city by the end of the year, and steep increases in parking fines.

The capital’s first car-free day last month achieved a 40 per-cent fall in air pollution and a 50 per-cent drop in noise pollution in parts of the city. Earlier this year a spike in smog levels briefly made Paris the world’s most polluted city, worse even than Shanghai. The authorities reacted by imposing a partial driving ban and making public transport free for a day. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:30:17.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
