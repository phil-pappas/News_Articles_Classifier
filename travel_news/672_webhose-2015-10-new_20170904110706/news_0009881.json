It doesn’t make sense.”\nMental health issues often seem illogical.\n“We’ve got to normalise the conversation around mental health and look at training organisations in anxiety and triggers and how we can manage triggers,” Mr Redmond said.\n“This is a good opportunity to work with employees and unlock their potential.”\nRead more about workplace health in CareerOne in your News Corp Australia newspaper today\n Single on 90K+: Might have an issue", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/world-mental-health-day-lifeline-stress-poll-reveals-work-main-cause/story-fnkgbb6w-1227563812315", "http://1010.org.au/", "https://twitter.com/ingioz"], "published": "2015-10-10T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:35:12.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
