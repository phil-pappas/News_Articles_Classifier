The Newseum Free Expression Award winners will be honored at a special event at the Newseum on March 16, 2016 .\nThe award recognizes those who exhibit passion for and dedication to free expression, including those who have taken personal or professional risks in sharing information with the public, are censored or punished by authorities or groups for their work, or show courage by pushing boundaries in artistic and media expression. The award categories are free speech, free press, religious freedom and freedom of expression in arts and entertainment.\nNominations for the Newseum Free Expression Awards will be open to the public at newseum.org/freeexpressionaward , and the selection committee for each category will be chaired by an individual who has made a significant impact in that area. The chairs are minister, attorney and author Oliver \"Buzz\" Thomas for the religious freedom category; Martin Baron , executive editor of The Washington Post , for free press; Freedom House President Mark P. Lagon for free speech; and actress Glenn Close for freedom of expression in arts and entertainment.\n\"Freedom of expression is a basic human right, and it is under attack in many parts of the world,\" said Jeffrey Herbst , president and CEO of the Newseum. \"We hope this award will draw attention to the courage of people around the world - from journalists to authors to artists - who are courageous enough to freely express themselves in places where it is often difficult or even dangerous to do so. The award is intended to honor those who are standing up for freedom and calling attention to the courage of their convictions.\"\nThe Newseum, which welcomes more than 800,000 visitors each year, works to champion the five freedoms of the First Amendment through interactive exhibits, engaging public programs and robust educational initiatives. The museum has become an important nonpartisan forum for spirited dialogue about the important issues of the day and a neutral location to discuss and debate the important principles upon which America was built.\nAbout the Newseum\nThe mission of the Newseum is to champion the five freedoms of the First Amendment through exhibits, public programs and education. One of the top attractions in Washington, D.C. , the dynamic, engaging and interactive museum allows visitors to experience the stories of yesterday and today through the eyes of the media while celebrating the freedoms guaranteed to all Americans by the First Amendment.
