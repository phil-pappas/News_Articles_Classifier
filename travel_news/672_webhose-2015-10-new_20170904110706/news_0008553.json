Tourism officials are hoping the new bridge will help promote hiking trails in the area and draw around 180,000 visitors every year, boosting the local economy by €2.5 million (£1.8million), the local news website Swr.de reports.

The walkway’s 24mm-thick glass panes are 25 times stronger than other forms of glass, allowing it to “stand firm even if tourists are jumping on it”, a worker who built the bridge told the China News Service .

Spanning 430 metres long and 300 metres high, it is set to be the world’s highest glass bridge once completed.

Last summer, Russia unveiled the 439-metre-long SkyBridge , which was described as “the world’s longest walkway” at the time. Standing 207 metres above the Krasnaya Polyana valley near Sochi, the footbridge includes two observation platforms, each offering panoramic views of the surrounding mountains and the Black Sea coast.

The 3ft-wide and 2.5 in-thick glass skywalk was said to have been designed to “shatter but not break” should a stone fall onto it from the mountain, according to a spokesperson for the local tourism board at the time. Closer to home, London opened its own glass walkway atop Tower Bridge last November, though the numbers don’t quite stack up against its Chinese rivals.

The five-sided cube juts out above the Chamonix Valley a kilometre below, offering a rather unsettling place to stand and enjoy views of the Mont Blanc Massif mountain range.
