The Bermuda Bash 2016 is unlike any other cruise in that it’s the first ever lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and ­straight ally (LGBTQIA) INCLUSIVE cruising experience. The five-day, 1900-person Bermuda Bash 2016 cruise will depart the Baltimore Harbor on Saturday, August 27, 2016, for Kings Warf, Bermuda and return on Thursday, September 1, 2016. Entertainment for Bermuda Bash 2016 include performances by 6-time Emmy Award winning comedian BRUCE VILANCH, Grammy-Nominated artist FRENCHIE DAVIS, award winning comedian/author SAMPSON, dance/vogue sensation LEIOMY MALDONADO and a cast of celebrity impersonators for a production of A DRAG SALUTE TO THE DIVAS, just to name a few.\nAs if the entertainment wasn’t epic enough, EDGE MEDIA NETWORK, the largest network of local LGBT news and entertainment publications in the world, has signed on to become a media partner for Bermuda Bash 2016. Edge serves 5+ million dedicated readers from a variety of metropolitan areas around the United States and beyond on the web, mobile web and native apps. They are the online destination for 7,500,000 people in 36+ cities throughout the U.S. “When researching possible media partners, we found that Edge perfectly embodied our culture of inclusion and diversity and aligned perfectly with Pride on the Sea’s Core Values, as evident in their philosophy statement. It’s a perfect match.” said Pride on the Sea’s Director of Operations & Special Events, Jessica L. Pierce.\nWith the historic June 26th, 2015, Supreme Court ruling recognizing marriage equality as a fundamental right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, we are at a pivotal point for LGBTQIA inclusion, alliance and understanding not only in the LGBTQI community, but also in the U.S. as a whole.\nPride on the Sea cruises are intended to build trust and community while improving the working and social relationships among all ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations & identifications, and the communities they represent through our program tracks and special events. Pride on the Sea cruises are centered on the LGBTQIA community and a core set of values of Personal Responsibility, Community Responsibility, Respect and Trust & Consent. These are values that every staff person, cruise participant, company and organization involved supports and are carried all the way from planning through implementation and evaluation of Pride on the Sea events and productions.\nAnother thing that makes Pride on the Sea unique is that not only do their cruises offer the standard all-inclusive benefits and fun (accommodations, dinning, ship-provided entertainment, etc), Pride on the Sea offers its guests a bit more; fun in a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere and six tracks of programming that are unique to their cruises. These program tracks include: Mind, Body & Soul, Political Empowerment & Community Engagement, Professional & Networking Events, Entertainment & Culture, Parties & Themed Events and Sass & Flirt.\n “Whether attending our cruise as a party vacation, a professional development resource or a romantic get-a-way, there will truly be something for everyone, and that’s exactly our point. At Pride on the Sea we aim to create unique experiences that embrace all identities and passions of every person that comes aboard our cruises…” said Howard Nelson Cromwell, Pride on the Sea’s President & Founder.\nTo learn more about Pride on the Sea, Bermuda Bash 2016, book a reservation or to become a partner, please visit www.prideonthesea.com.\n ####\nMedia Contact: Jessica L.
