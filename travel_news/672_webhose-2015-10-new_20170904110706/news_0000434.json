La Monica POSTED: 06:59 AM PDT Oct 19, 2015 UPDATED: 10:47 AM PDT Oct 19, 2015 \nIs United Continental Airlines preparing to name an interim CEO? Related Content United Airlines' new CEO hospitalized \nThe company's CEO Oscar Munoz was admitted to the hospital last week. \nUnited non-executive chairman Henry L. Meyer III said in a statement Monday morning that the airline \"anticipates it will today conclude the corporate governance process necessitated by the hospitalization\" of Munoz. \nUnited announced Friday that Munoz, who just joined the company in September, was admitted to the hospital on Thursday. \nThe company has not said why he was admitted. But several other news organizations have reported that Munoz had a heart attack. \nMonday's statement left many questions unanswered. \nIs Munoz still in the hospital? Who was making decisions for the company since Thursday? Vice chairman Jim Compton? COO Greg Hart? \nAll United said on Friday was that the airline was \"continuing to operate normally.\" \nBut what does that mean? It's not normal to have your CEO in the hospital. \nUnited obviously needs to do what it can to protect the privacy of Munoz and his family. The company also can only share what it knows and it's possible that Munoz' family is being tight-lipped. \nIt also goes without saying that the most important thing right now is for Munoz to get better. \nBut shareholders also want to know what's going on. \nMunoz, 56, was brought on to help repair United's image. He was previously president of railroad CSX and also was an executive at Coke, Pepsi and AT&T. \nHe took over as CEO last month following the ouster of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who was involved in a scandal tied to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. \nThe Port Authority is being probed for corruption. \nIts former chairman David Samson had a vacation home in Charleston, South Carolina. And United began a twice-weekly flight from Newark, N.J. to Charleston that it stopped shortly after Samson resigned. \nIn addition to the Port Authority ties, the airline suffered a major computer glitch this summer that shut down flights. \nUnited also ranks at the bottom for customer satisfaction among major airlines according to several surveys. \nMany analysts (and travelers) feel that United Airlines is still suffering from integration issues as a result of its merger with Continental five years ago. \nUnited's stock has lagged Delta, Southwest and its other big rivals in the past five years. \nEric Marshall, a portfolio manager with Hodges Capital and holder of United stock, said it is important for United to have good leadership in place. \nHe conceded that it would be a blow to United if Munoz is unable to return anytime soon. \nMarshall said one reason why investors were excited about Munoz is because of his experience at CSX. \nRailroads have already gone through some of the same challenges that United has now -- such as dealing with consolidation and poor customer service. \nBut Marshall added that he's confident United will be able to get back on track even if the company needs to find a new CEO. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:30:33.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
