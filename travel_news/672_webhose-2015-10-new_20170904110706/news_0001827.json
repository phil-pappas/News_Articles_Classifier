Central Hall Westminster will be the only English landmark joining the global initiative. Central Hall Westminster was the chosen venue for the very first General Assembly of the newly formed United Nations - a time that saw the appointment of the first Secretary General, along with the creation of the Security Council and the International Court of Justice. 51 member countries sent delegations and Prime Minister Clement Attlee welcomed the UN to ‘this ancient home of liberty and order’. Paul Southern, Managing Director at Central Hall Westminster, comments: “We are extremely proud of the great heritage of our venue. The inaugural meeting of the United Nations is certainly a stand-out event in our history, so we look forward to representing the UK’s celebrations of the anniversary by turning the venue blue – something that will certainly be a first for Central Hall!” To add to the celebrations, Central Hall is also hosting the “UNEARTH” exhibition, created by the UN Department of Public Information and the Gabarron Foundation, featuring some of the most powerful photographs in the organisation’s vast iconic archives. The free exhibition will be open to the public daily from 13th October to 11th December 2015.
