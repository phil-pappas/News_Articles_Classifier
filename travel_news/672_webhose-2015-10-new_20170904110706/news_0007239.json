It also highlights competitive factors and key approaches in the market. The base year of the study is 2014, with forecasts up to 2020.\nThe rail system of today faces multiple challenges surrounding enhanced quality of services, optimized solutions, passenger satisfaction, and fleet availability. However, with diagnostic systems gaining more traction across industries, rail manufacturers and operators will gradually start leveraging such tools to unbundle the complexities witnessed in the industry. Incorporating fundamental changes in the rail transportation sector involves a high degree of complexity because (a) the industry is very conservative to adopt newer processes and methods; and (b) inability of fleet operators to maximize fleet availability while sustaining passenger satisfaction and safety. The integration of real-time diagnostics will create a whole set of benefits never witnessed before in this industry.\nGiven that the core focus will be to deliver optimized maintenance of assets related to train and infrastructure, remote diagnostics will help integrate interactions between locomotives, service depot, strategic assets, and IT support based services. Such a structured digitized workflow will facilitate a high degree of optimization and end-to-end decision making that will deliver tremendous value to end users.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1.
