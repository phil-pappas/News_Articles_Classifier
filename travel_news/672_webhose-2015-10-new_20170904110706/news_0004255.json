Murakami is internationally recognised for his distinctive style of pop and animé designs; and now he’s brought his work to the ski world. The lift pass art is part of Aspen’s Art in Unexpected Places programme, which started in 2005. The resort was recognised as a National Arts Award recipient for “Best Businesses Partnering with the Arts in America” by Americans for the Arts in 2013. Each year an artist is invited to create lift pass designs – previous artists involved have been Anne Collier, Mark Bradford, Mark Grotjahn and Mamma Anderson, to name a few. All the designs have had completely different inspirations and styles. Each year Aspen has different lift pass designs Photo: Aspen Snowmass But this isn’t the first time the art world and the ski industry have crossed paths… British sculptures in Austrian Alps British sculptor Anthony Gormley created 100 life-size human figures and placed them high in the Austrian Alps in 2010. Gormley scattered his creations over 150km 2 in Lech and the surrounding area as part of a project called Horizon Field. The sculptures stood for two years in the mountain elements and received great media attention. Anthony Gormley's eerie Horizon Field project in Lech Photo: Markus Tretter Ski resort poster exhibition In 2013 the Austrian resort of St Anton put on an exhibition of Swiss and Austrian original ski posters. The Arlberg Hospiz hotel held the event, with posters from the 1976 Innsbruck Winter Games, plus various other resorts, on display. Freestyler styles his own range of skis Eric Pollard designs and rides for Line skis . He began designing for Line in 2003 but has been sponsored by them since 1997. The Eric Pollard 2015 collection includes four models of ski, poles and a T-shirt. Moving art on the slopes The North Face rider Sage Cattabriga Alosa had a vision of creating a ski film infused with art. He collaborated with photographer Adam Clark and The North Face to make his drawings come to life. His patterns and drawings were projected on to the snow while Sage performed tricks in front of the camera. The project was called Experience Sage Project. Bauhaus designer creates ski resort The Bauhaus architect Marcel Breuer designed the French resort of Flaine . In the 1960s the Hungarian master of Modernism was brought on board to help create a resort that would blend with the environment around it, as well as optimising the ski slope links to the village. Breuer was also famous for being involved in making the Palais de l’Unesco in Paris and the Whitney Museum in New York. Artistic hotel The Elizabeth Arthotel in Ischgl , Austria, is renowned for combining luxury accommodation with art displays. Owner Gunther Aloy has acquired paintings from the Venice Biennale and Art Basel – more than 120 works by young, contemporary artists from Austria and its neighbouring countries adorn the corridors and walls. Pieces can be purchased directly on site or bid for at auction at the end of the season. Elizabeth Arthotel combines modern art and luxury lodgings University ski lift art competition Montana’s State University collaborated with Bridger Bowl ski resort on a student competition to find the best art made from parts of a ski lift.
