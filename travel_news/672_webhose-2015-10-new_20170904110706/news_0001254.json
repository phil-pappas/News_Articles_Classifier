The beaches are filled with vacationers enjoying tranquil turquoise waters, powdery white sand and all of the fun and relaxation for which the islands are known. This is a far cry from the effects of Hurricane Joaquin last week, a Category 4 Hurricane that damaged some of the Islands in the Central and Southern Bahamas. \nIt’s important to remember that The Bahamas is an archipelago with more than 700 islands and keys spread over 100,000 square miles. Therefore, while some of the islands are experiencing hurricane conditions, many others are not being affected. In essence, hurricanes rarely affect the entire country. \nThe Abacos, Andros, Bimini, Eleuthera, Cat Island and the Exumas are also fine. The airports are open and the cruise ports are receiving ships; hotel properties are welcoming guests. \nThe islands in the Central and Southern Bahamas including Acklins, Crooked Island, Long Island, Mayaguana, Inagua, San Salvador and Rum Cay sustained damages from flooding and high winds. Power remains out on several of these islands and they require assistance in the weeks and perhaps months ahead. \n“It is essential that our travel trade partners understand that while Mother Nature dealt us a hard blow with Hurricane Joaquin, much of the destination remains pristine, beautiful and open for business,” says Greg Rolle, senior director, Sales and Marketing, The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. “We ask that you continue to send your clients to the Northern islands in The Bahamas with the assurance that they will find it unchanged, unspoiled, and the ideal vacation paradise it has always been. We appreciate your continued support and business.” \nAbout The Islands Of The Bahamas \nThe Islands Of The Bahamas have a place in the sun for everyone from Nassau and Paradise Island to Grand Bahama to The Abaco Islands, The Exuma Islands, Harbour Island, Long Island and others. Each island has its own personality and attractions for a variety of vacation styles with some of the world’s best scuba diving, fishing, sailing, boating, as well as, shopping and dining. The destination offers an easily accessible tropical getaway and provides convenience for travelers with preclearance through U.S. customs and immigration, and the Bahamian dollar is on par with the U.S. dollar. Do everything or do nothing, just remember It’s Better in The Bahamas.
