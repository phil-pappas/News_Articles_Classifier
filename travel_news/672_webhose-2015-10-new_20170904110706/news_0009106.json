Postcards confirmed this with views of glorious colour. We drove north from Cape Town to Citrusdal and Clanwilliam to walk in the national parks of Groot Winterberg and Cederberg. Excellent trails wound through dramatically weathered Table Mountain sandstone, but there were few flowers. The colours we enjoyed were from red rock, yellow grass and fynbos, and deep blue sky. The strange but wonderful thing was that we were all alone to enjoy this magnificent scenery. Local holidays were over and European walkers elsewhere, so, as well as winter, we were also escaping crowds. Our holiday ended in Tulbach, an unspoilt gem of Dutch colonial splendour, ideal for unhurried wine-tasting.

But what stays in my mind the longest were the battlefield sites near Ladysmith. Isandlwana was such a haunting, evocative place. A wide-open site with the rock that gives the site its name towering over the cairns of so many young men. Spion Kop was quite different, a rocky mountain giving the soldiers no chance of digging in against the Boers. And then Rorke’s Drift. The hospital is there together with the tiny cattle enclosure that was banked up with biscuit tins and mealie bags – all the men had to protect themselves against the Zulus. Eleven men were awarded the Victoria Cross. Only one thing was missing – Michael Caine. Lucilla Lang, Solihull The Cape of Good Hope Photo: Fotolia/AP Capturing Cape Town We only had a week in late September, but we made the most if it. Cape Town Camps Bay Retreat Hotel, just perfect in lovely gardens, short walk to the beach, plus Louis’s cocktails in Camps Bay Hotel. A few minutes’ taxi into Cape Town for afternoon tea at Mount Nelson, then Kirstenbosch Gardens to see 250 types of their national flower, the protea. A half-day visit to Robben Island, then back to the view from top of Table Mountain. Hire car to Stellenbosch wine region to chose from six of world’s top restaurants. Try the Vergelegen Vineyard and Lady Phillips restaurant for matchless wines, food and service. Drive down for two nights at Hermanus to watch the southern right whales and new calves breach near the shore. Ian Elliott, Belfast Camps Bay Photo: Fotolia/AP Safari sights From the minute we entered Addo National park in Port Elizabeth we embarked on a magical journey into the animal kingdom. Driving to our lodge, we had to sit patiently until a large ostrich decided to vacate its spot in the sun so that we could continue our journey. On arrival we saw our first lions, a family group of brother and two sisters nonchalantly drinking from the waterhole and basking in the sun. Later, during the evening safari, we came face to face with a giant bull elephant that was so close we could see its beautiful, long eyelashes. The highlight was sighting the elusive white rhino, which, despite their reputation, are incredibly shy animals. Witnessing the lion family killing a kudo on our last morning was high drama, indeed, and a reminder that this is nature in the raw. The hospitality of the people who are genuinely welcoming makes this a special place with so much to offer. Sharon Smith, Aberdeen Elephants in Addo National Park Photo: Fotolia/AP Wild Coast walk Blazing sunshine, thundering surf, gliding pelicans and schools of dolphins are constant companions to the five-day walk along the beaches of the Wild Coast in South Africa’s Eastern Cape. The Strandloper trail is an easy, spectacular route from the remote Kob Inn to East London. Most of the rivers that cut through to the sea can be forded at low tide. Occasionally there is a ramshackle dinghy lying on the banks to use. At the fast-flowing, muddy Kei River, there is a ferry of sorts – upturned beer crates on a flat-bottomed dory and an outboard that has seen better days. The sand is golden, the headlands gentle ascents, the view ever changing. A bizarre but common experience is dodging the local Xhosa tribe’s cows on the beach. The occasional wreck is a picturesque but sobering sight. Walk slowly. We did. We wanted it to last forever. Andrew McLeod, Dorset Photo: Fotolia/AP Breathtaking ride Many people know about the delightful Garden Route along the Cape Coast, but there is also breathtaking scenery in the mountain ranges farther inland. On a misty morning we decided to take the route from Groenfontein to the picturesque town of Prince Albert through the vertiginous pass of the majestic Swartberg range. An ominous sign saying “Gevaar/Danger – Do Not Pass” and a drawing of falling rocks greeted us at the start. Holding our breath, trying not to look down the sheerest of drops on the one side of this narrow, bumpy road, but trying to appreciate the sheer grandeur of it all, we finally limped into Prince Albert. As this pretty town is also known for its eccentric characteristics, we were on the lookout and, sure enough, on the high street next to the old colonial hotel was a house embellished with cast-iron “lace” on the veranda and a magnificent frangipani tree in the garden. Hanging from the branches were transparent plastic bags filled with water with a goldfish in each. Thinking this cruel, we inspected them more closely and discovered they were all fake. No one was at home to solve this piscatorial mystery and, by then, we needed something soothing in the hotel pub, so we are still in the dark. Jackie Pilkington, Wiltshire Photo: Fotolia/AP Artists’ paradise Leave the lights and crowds of Cape Town and drive out to the isolated Groot Karoo and Little Karoo. Many places are little changed from a century ago. Nieu Bethesda has no street lights and can be reached only by dirt roads, but it is an artists’ paradise due to the concrete and glass sculptures of Helen Martin. Graaff Reinet, the fourth-oldest town in South Africa, has many Cape Dutch buildings constructed in the early 1800s. One is the impressive Drostdy hotel, incorporating restored Karoo cottages. The beautiful Dutch Reformed church has both a kitchen and a chimney, and the nearby striking Valley of Desolation needs no further description. Matjiesfontein, founded by a Scottish railwayman in the 1880s as a Victorian health spa, is now a collection of historical buildings, with the Boer War military hospital now the grand Lord Milner hotel. Complete the trip with ostrich-rich Oudtshoorn and the Garden Route by the Indian Ocean for a memorable holiday.
