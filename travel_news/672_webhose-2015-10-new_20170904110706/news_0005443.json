Throw in ice rinks, winter wonderland amusement rides and must-see shop windows; the anticipation of a possible White Christmas grows exponentially. \nBut department store windows should be at the top of the list. \nCatch the London Underground to Oxford Circus and make your way west along Oxford Street. \nJohn Lewis's \"the gifts they've been dreaming of\" theme with penguins last year was a treat. Photos View Photo Gallery \nCheck out the House of Frazer lights, enjoy the pop-up carollers and bands, the odd Santa Claus and the street decorations as you make your way to the department store everyone raves about. \nSelfridges&Co - made more famous when its history became a TV show - is renowned for its legendary window displays. \nThe 23 windows in the 2014 extravaganza were not your average bedtime stories, rather traditional fairy tales like Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltskin or the goose that laid the golden egg, with a modern twist. \nApparently there were 197,000 baubles, 10,000 laser-cut leaves, 1005 Christmas trees and 600 cans of gold spray paint used store-wide. \nImagine what magic 2015 might hold. \nIf you have time, do Harrods too, near Knightsbridge station, but everyone in London seemed underwhelmed at recent offerings. \nWant some mulled wine, gingerbread and quality trimmings (TIP: go for the truffle brie) for a Christmas get-together? Borough Market - open Wednesday to Saturday - is enchanting. \nJust Google London Christmas markets and ice skating rinks for many more options. \nA train ride under the English Channel on the Eurostar will have you checking out all charming Paris has to offer in just more than two hours. \nStart with a Nutella crepe near the Eiffel Tower, wander through Trocadero Christmas markets and take a skate around the ice rink and then settle in for a hop-on hop-off boat ride on the Siene River. \nWhen you're ready, jump on the metro to Chaussée d'Antin - La Fayette station. \nGaleries La Fayette made its theme Noel Monstre come alive with monsters scaring, or alternatively endearing, children at each window in 2014. Similarly, nearby Printemps, just a block further down Boulevard Haussmann, is worth combatting the fierce crowds for. Last year's \"Noel, Voyage Magique au Printemps, by Burberry\" was engaging, charming and a clever use of all the brand had to offer. \nChristmas, a magical journey had teddies in miniature Burberry trench coats with scarves and umbrellas. Handbags were made into houses and railway arches. \nDuck to the top floor Brasserie under the magnificent art nouveau stained glass dome for lunch. \nAfter giving your legs a break, jump back on the boat to the Louvre. \nWander through Jardin des Tuileries to Avenue des Champs-Elysees which is lined with wooden chalets offering myriad delights to tantalise the tongue. \nAs you near the Arc de Triomphe, you'll find the famous brand name shops remain open for late-night shopping fun including macaroon specialist Laduree. \nWe might be used to beach-time or chilling with the aircon on full blast, but the crisp December days our European counterparts enjoy are worth the chance at a Christmas-card perfect scene. christmas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:47:41.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
