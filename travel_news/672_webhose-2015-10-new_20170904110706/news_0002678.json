With increased tuition fees and rising costs of living, it can cost in excess of £21,000 per year for students to study in the UK. But British students could save thousands by studying abroad, according to new research, which analyses every country with an institution in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings . The increasing price of studying in the UK may drive students elsewhere for university The cheapest countries to study aboard in are Kenya, Bangladesh, Argentina, Norway and Poland. Studying in countries such as India and Russia could be five times less expensive than in the UK, according to currency services provider Fairfx . In 2015, average tuition fees combined with living costs was £3,629.62 in India and £4,449.90 in Russia. The 10 least expensive countries to study in Country Cost Kenya 1,041.20 Bangladesh 1,276.48 Argentina 2,151.61 Norway 2,188.50 Poland 2,309.36 Slovenia 3,302.37 Belarus 3,450.11 Ukraine 3,512.05 India 3,629.62 Slovakia 3,741.23 Colombia 4,026.88 This is in contrast to an annual cost of £21,000 in the UK - the fifth most expensive country in the rankings. This is partially because of increased tuition fees of up to £9,000 per year, while studying abroad can offer cheaper fees, alongside lower living costs, quality of education and favourable exchange rates. The countries that were found to be more expensive for British students were the US, Singapore, South Korea and Australia. In Australia - the most expensive country - British students would pay an average of £27,277.16 per year - up three per cent in two years due to exchange rates. The 10 most expensive countries to study in Country Cost Japan 14,896.33 Switzerland 15,199.61 UAE 18,956.70 Canada 19,322.72 Hong Kong 20,720.91 UK 21,000.00 US 23,591.74 Singapore 25,308.66 South Korea 25,565.97 Australia 27,277.16 Studying for a year in China or France would cost three times less than the UK – in the region of £7,000 – while Brazil would cost £8,000 and New Zealand £13,000. \"There is a definite financial incentive with the opportunity to experience a new country and culture\" Darren Kilner A total of 13 new European countries have entered the world rankings this year , including Belarus, Cyprus, Iceland and Luxembourg. According to the analysis, three of these new countries would take the lead as the cheapest study destinations in the world. Darren Kilner, currency expert and Fairfx, said: \"Higher tuition fees are making students consider their options when it comes to choosing a university. With the investment costs so high, it’s no surprise that students are looking at cheaper ways of securing their university education and studying abroad is becoming a much more attractive option. \"Not only can UK students take advantage of lower tuition fees but the cost of living can also be much lower so there is a definite financial incentive along with the opportunity to experience a new country and culture. It could become a real alternative to taking a gap year.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:19:20.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
