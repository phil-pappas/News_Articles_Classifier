Together, the group boasts a combined portfolio of over 6,000 hotels with more than 640,000 guest rooms in 55 countries across all regions. \n\nOver the past two years, Plateno had acquired 17 brands with over 400 mid and upscale hotels either in operation or under construction. Its diverse portfolio includes Lavande, H12, Portofino, 7 Days Inn and Xana Hotello, among others. \n\nJin Jiang’s established brands include J.Hotel, Rock Garden (Yan Hua Yuan) and Jin Jiang Inn. Earlier this year, the company also acquired France’s Louvre Hotels Group (LHG) from Starwood Holdings, incorporating the Golden Tulip, Premiere Classe and Campanile brands. \n\nA join statement says this cooperation “will help facilitate integration of the three group’s (Plateno, Jin Jiang and LHG) back-end systems, improve their operational efficiency, share information of domestic and foreign suppliers, and effectively utilise the supply chain resources at home and abroad so that an industry platform with much better efficiency can be built”. \n\nThe ultimate goal of the strategic cooperation is “to create a leading and competitive international group with global brand influence in the world”, the statement added. \n\nPlateno and Jin Jiang will continue to operate independently with plans to develop a central booking and CRM system to optimise channel and revenue management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:01:14.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
