To our loyal Toobs fans out there, sincere thanks for your support.”\nToobs are the latest in a long line of old-school snacks to fall victim to Australia’s changing tastes, and manufacturers seem to be clueing on that public nostalgia does not equal sales.\nRelaunched in 2007 by popular demand after a six-year hiatus, the jig is now up for the cheesy tubes.\nAnd they’re not the only casualties of our shifting habits.\n“When I was a little girl, we had these wonderful lollies called Spearmint Leaves.” Source: News Corp Australia\nAllens has refused to back down on its decision to axe its Spearmint Leaves and Green Frogs despite a public outcry, saying they simply weren’t selling.\nIt seems the popularity of Spearmint Leaves as a topping for elaborate cakes and milkshakes is not enough to make them profitable.\nA social media campaign to save the retro sweets in time for Christmas has so far been unsuccessful.\nA spokeswoman for Allen’s parent company Nestle told the Herald Sun that said she was surprised by the public response, since the classic sweets had only been available in specialty lolly shops.\nTimes have changed since 2010, when Tasty Toobs led a retro snack resurgence alongside Samboy potato chips and Barney Banana ice-creams.\nIt seems that our emotional attachment to the treats we enjoyed in childhood does not mean we will actually buy them.\n Tasty Toobs, we have failed you", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/tasty-toobs-we-should-have-paid-you-more-attention-while-we-could/story-fnkgdftz-1227563862381", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/09/1227563/861861-fbebdcaa-6e45-11e5-99e3-ad32ef3bcdab.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/allens-call-to-drop-beloved-spearmint-leaves-green-frogs-leaves-sour-taste/story-fni0fit3-1227420916313"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:34:21.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
