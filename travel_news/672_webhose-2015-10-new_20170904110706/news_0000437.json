The Corporate Culture Awards celebrate 50 companies in Greater Philadelphia that have successfully championed a positive, productive and performance-driven culture, and have worked with their employees to develop successful cultural practices. “It is an honor to be recognized for the hard work we put into our company’s culture and to be named one of SmartCEO’s Corporate Culture Award winners,” said Bill Vergantino, ExpenseWatch president and CEO. “Maintaining a culture that creates a foundation for our employees to view ExpenseWatch as their best employment experience is one of the five success factors we believe drives our ability to succeed.”\n“The leaders of the companies named to the inaugural Corporate Culture Awards have realized that running a company is more than head count and the bottom line. It’s about creating a place where creativity, energy and ideas are cultivated.
