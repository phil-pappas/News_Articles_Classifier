Eventually, the terrain became too steep and it got dark.\nRescuers descended cliffs off-trail in the darkness to reach the 18-year-old hikers, identified as Haley Whitehouse of Somersworth, New Hampshire; Baily Ryan of Middlebury, Vermont, and Allison White of Weybridge, Vermont.\nThe hikers were helped down the mountain, reaching the trailhead at 8:30 p.m.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:32:41.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
