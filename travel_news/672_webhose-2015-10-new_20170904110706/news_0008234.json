On an eventful and drama-fuelled day at Quinta do Lago, List's moment to cherish was realised when the Wellington College student holed from 180 yards for an eagle two at the 12th. List was two over par through eight, but picked up birdies in the next two holes before he spotted Ince, who has had a property at Quinta do Lago for nearly 20 years, gave the 47-year-old a wave and struck his memorable back nine iron. After throwing his arms into the air and falling flat on his back, he ran over to Ince, who shook his hand and told the rising junior that “I’d better follow you now”. List, who hails from Perth, Australia, admitted: “It would be huge to win. I’d love to play in the BMW Pro-Am at Wentworth next year [the boys’ winner will tee up alongside the professionals] as it is my home course. “It’s my first time out here and I know Jamie Li (below) has played here a few times, but I feel that I can give him a good game tomorrow.” Li, the overnight leader and two-time Telegraph finalist, and the methodical John Gough both posted 69s, with the former going into the final round holding a two-shot lead at -4. List, Callum Farr and Joe Bryce, the only Scot in the field, all shot 71s to finish five shots off the lead. Earlier, Thomas Plumb held out from 111 yards for an eagle three at the 5th, this after losing his ball on the first. Conversely, Olivia Mehaffey, the brilliant Northern Irish junior, shot an adventurous two under par 70 and holds an eight-shot shot lead in the girls' event, one of the biggest gaps in our Junior Championship history. The greens again posed a tough assignment for the 21 finalists, but not for Mehaffey, the world No 16 amateur. Olivia Mehaffey has been brilliant round the greens The Royal County Down member posted six birdies and four bogeys, a round which also consisted of putts ranging from a 20ft birdie and a 40ft par save. “I just want to go as low as I can and I really hope I can do a bogey-free round tomorrow,” the Banbridge-based junior said. “Once I think about what club I want, I just go and hit it.” Overnight co-leader Eloise Healey had to be content with a 78, while Chloe Howard will make up the final group after posting a 76 for the second successive round.
