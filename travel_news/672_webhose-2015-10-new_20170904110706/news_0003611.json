Alexandra Ma Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/05/2015 05:17 PM EDT | Edited: 20 minutes ago \nLooking for a vacation getaway this week? Don't go to China if you don't like crowds. \nOct. 1-7 marks China's \"Golden Week,\" a seven-day public holiday celebrating China's national day, which was on Oct. 1. Typically during this week, offices and factories shut down, the skies are relatively clear of pollution and people travel. \nThis year, over 750 million Chinese people are expected to make trips across the country, per Chinese transport authorities. After a stampede on the Bund, a historical tourist hotspot in Shanghai, killed 36 people on New Year's Day this year, China mandated that all tourist landmarks had to stop selling tickets and alert local authorities as soon as visitor numbers reached maximum capacity. \nBut armed with smartphones, umbrellas and selfie sticks, people still braved the crowds to visit iconic Chinese landmarks, such as the Forbidden City in Beijing and West Lake in Hangzhou.
