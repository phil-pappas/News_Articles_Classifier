Unlike any other program, there is no minimum spend requirement and no maximum point limit. The lack of restrictions means the earning potential is vast, leading to faster, easier routes to the tangible and meaningful rewards planners deserve, like free nights.\nThe new go meet aligns with the simplicity and generosity of the new Wyndham Rewards, launched by Wyndham Hotel Group in May 2015 , which, dollar for dollar, lets members earn more and redeem faster than any other program in the industry today. It's the first major rewards program of its kind to offer a flat 15,000-point free night redemption rate and the only program in the industry to offer a minimum of 1,000 points with every qualified stay.\n\"The rising demand for group and meetings travel, coupled with an industry full of complicated rewards programs, gives us a unique opportunity to deliver more value and gain planners' trust, business and loyalty,\" said Geoff Ballotti , president and CEO, Wyndham Hotel Group. \"With go meet, we're recognizing planners around the world for their partnership, hard work and the business they bring to our hotels.\"\nBallotti continued, \"Planners told us about the challenges they face, like minimum spend thresholds, maximum point limits and a lack of value. We're addressing these pain points head on with the world's most generous rewards program for meeting planners. Not only are we giving them a simple program and faster, more meaningful rewards, but with 230 hotels with 10 or more meeting rooms and 145 hotels with at least 10,000 square feet of function space, we can meet all of their event needs.\"\nAdditionally, go meet is the first formal rewards program of its kind to cater to both professional and casual planners across every hotel segment. Every planner is eligible to earn, from the corporate meeting planner booking a large-scale convention at a full-service property to a team coach coordinating accommodations at an economy hotel for a basketball tournament.\nThe new program also allows event guests who are members of Wyndham Rewards and who are paying for their rooms directly to earn a minimum of 1,000 Wyndham Rewards points on a qualified stay. As such, both planners and individually paying guests can earn valuable rewards.\nPlanners earn points through go meet on qualifying revenue – which includes the rates of ten or more sleeping rooms on at least one night, meeting room rentals or qualified food and beverage charges – for any contracted meeting or event booked and completed at participating Wyndham Rewards hotels globally. The contract must state that go meet applies to the event.\nWyndham Hotel Group's diverse portfolio of approximately 7,700 hotels in 71 countries offers more than 10 million square feet of meeting and event space worldwide along with quality accommodations for every travel need and price point.\nFor more information on go meet and full terms and conditions, visit www.wyndhamrewards.com/gomeet .\nAbout Wyndham Hotel Group\nWyndham Hotel Group is the world's largest hotel company based on number of hotels and is one of three hospitality business units of Wyndham Worldwide ( NYSE: WYN ).
