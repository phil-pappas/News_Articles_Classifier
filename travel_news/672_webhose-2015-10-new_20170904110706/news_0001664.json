He has dark hair and wears a white shirt with red and blue stripes.\nMexican drug cartels are known to recruit minors to work as “halcones” (hawks), or lookouts, to warn them about the movements of security forces or suspicious people.\nBut there have been some cases of children committing violent crimes.\nIn March, a 13-year-old boy was arrested in the northern industrial hub of Monterrey in possession of an AK-47 assault rifle, a handgun, bullets and drugs.\nIn December 2010, authorities arrested a U.S.-born 14-year-old who was later convicted of working as a hitman for a drug gang. He admitted to killing four people, in a case that shocked Mexico.\nThe boy, known as “El Ponchis,” was released in 2013 at age 17 and flew to Texas to be reunited with his mother.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:53:40.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
