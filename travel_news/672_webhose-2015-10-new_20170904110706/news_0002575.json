Can I challenge the will? A Yes B No C Only if you are very poor ANSWERS Q1 Answer: A, B and C All three, depending on when you die, whether you are married and whether you have children. The rules governing how much you can pass on tax-free at death are changing. Currently, everyone is entitled to pass on £325,000 of wealth tax-free. But from April 2017 the Government is phasing in the “family home allowance”, which lets property owners pass on an extra £175,000 tax-free, bringing the total to £500,000 per person or £1m for couples. To qualify, the property must have been the family home and be left to direct descendants. Q2 Answer: B The new increased allowance is for property owners only. If you do not leave a property in your will, your beneficiaries will have to pay IHT if your total estate is worth more than the £325,000 threshold, not the higher £500,000 allowance. As well as property, your estate includes all your assets – cash, savings, investments, any business you own, cars and payouts from life insurance policies. IHT is payable at 40pc on everything above the threshold. So if your estate is worth £400,000, IHT is currently payable on £75,000, which at 40pc equates to £30,000. Q3 Answer: B If you are unmarried and child-free, you may want to leave your estate to siblings or nieces and nephews. However, the new family home allowance will not apply to you. The extra £175,000 chunk of tax-free inheritance only applies when your home is passed to your children (or step/ adopted/foster children) or grandchildren. If you leave your estate to a niece or nephew the tax-free threshold of £325,000 will apply. Q4 Answer: A and C “A deed of variation is commonly used if the beneficiary doesn’t need the inheritance and so they decide to redirect it to their own children, grandchildren or another person,” says Patrick Connolly, head of communications at Chase de Vere. “This can reduce the original beneficiary’s future inheritance tax bill, because the inheritance is deemed to have never been in their estate.” The deed of variation must be completed within two years of the deceased’s death. Some say it can be used as a tax dodge – but it is legal. Alistair Cunningham, financial planning director at Wingate Financial Planning, says IHT reduction is just one reason for a deed of variation. “Other common reasons might be to provide for those omitted from any provisions made, to change the nature of gifts (for example, from a right to live in a property only, to the full ownership of the property), or to resolve any uncertainty or other defect in the will.” Q5 Answer: A In theory, yes, but there is no guarantee of success. In a recent court case, a daughter successfully challenged her late mother’s will, in which she received nothing. Heather Ilott’s mother left all her money to charities, but after a long court battle Ilott, who was surviving on benefits, managed to get the will overturned and was awarded £164,000. The case does not set a precedent though – other disinherited children could end up disappointed. If you have any doubt about the facts on IHT, consult a financial adviser.
