How do you overcome them and keep business innovation on cruise control? Here are five ways to change the way you approach new thinking. Lose your fear of risk-taking When Steve Jobs entered the tablet market, did he know that Apple would become the top tablet vendor in the world? Perhaps not, yet he took a big risk, and that’s what counts. Businesses that are afraid of risk can miss valuable opportunities for innovation and growth. Foster a culture of calculated risk-taking. Encourage staff to think through each risk scenario carefully, gather as much data as possible, evaluate the odds of success – and failure – and then determine if a risk is worth taking. Have a flexible operating structure Innovation often stalls in organisations with hierarchical models that promote micromanagement and a “command and control” style of leadership. Most start-ups are flat and agile, so the key is to retain that structure as the business scales. One of the best ways to do that is to keep communication lines open, says Shellye Archambeau, chief executive officer of tech firm MetricStream . “Listen to people. When someone suggests a new idea, discuss how it could work,” she says. “Try saying ‘yes’ more often and provide opportunities for feedback and improvement, both top-down and bottom-up.” Don’t let the past kill the future Times change and what worked well in past may not be in demand tomorrow, and that can be a hard thing for successful businesses to accept. As a result, the legacy business creates a barrier, innovation fails to flourish and new ideas are killed because they could threaten existing revenue streams. Michael Karg, chief executive officer of digital agency Razorfish International , says: “For innovation to take off, especially when it has the potential to eat into the existing revenue streams, it should be structurally separate and protected from the legacy business.” Rethink capital spend Curbing non-essential capital expenditure will substantially help growth, but that doesn’t have to mean putting a stop to spending. It just means redeploying finances in a more efficient way, for example, on a monthly subscription basis. Business essentials, such as IT equipment and services, can be accessed “as a service” on a subscription basis with no upfront cost, says Nick East, chief executive officer of Zynstra . “This effectively turns what might have been a significant capital expense to an operating expense, potentially freeing up funds for other strategic investments,” he says. Engage your people Some of the best business innovations emerge as solutions to customers’ problems. You can give incentives to staff at the coalface who are most aware of those problems by offering bonuses for innovating. Brian Millar, head of strategy at innovation firm Sense Worldwide , says: “If there are people inside your organisation who resist change, involve them upfront in any innovation initiative. Listen to their objections, get them in front of your customers, and help them to come to their own epiphanies.” You may also be interested in: • Business success stories reveal moment of truth » • How to make a good first impression during a pitch » • How to network, influence people and win new business »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T23:33:06.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
