On this additional capacity, system wide traffic for September increased 10.1 per cent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity and Air Canada rouge Â® .\n\"I am pleased to report continued strong traffic growth of 10.1 per cent and a load factor of 83.6 per cent for the month of September,\" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Air Canada generated greater traffic in all markets served led by the U.S. transborder, Pacific and Atlantic markets. In particular, the Atlantic market grew 12.7 per cent in September despite the higher than normal volumes in traffic the previous year resulting from labour disruptions that affected certain European carriers. Load factor of 86.9 per cent for the third quarter is in line with last year's record for the same period. These strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of our commercial strategy focusing on international growth. This year's Ipsos Reid Business Traveller Survey released in September confirms Air Canada is the preferred airline for frequent business travellers by a continuingly growing margin. I would like to thank our customers for choosing Air Canada and our employees for taking care of them while transporting them safely to their destination.\"\nSeptember\nQ3\nYear-To-Date\n2015\n2014\nChange\n2015\n2014\nChange\n2015\n2014\nChange\nTraffic (RPMs mln)\n6,104\n5,545\n+10.1%\n20,462\n18,565\n+10.2%\n52,244\n47,526\n+9.9%\nCapacity (ASMs mln)\n7,301\n6,546\n+11.5%\n23,535\n21,299\n+10.5%\n62,002\n56,486\n+9.8%\nLoad Factor\n83.6%\n84.7%\n-1.1 pts\n86.9%\n87.2%\n-0.3 pts\n84.3%\n84.1%\n+0.2 pts\nCanada\nRPMs\n1,630\n1,587\n+2.7%\n5,606\n5,417\n+3.5%\n13,936\n13,472\n+3.4%\nASMs\n2,028\n1,937\n+4.7%\n6,649\n6,344\n+4.8%\n16,739\n16,201\n+3.3%\nLF\n80.4%\n81.9%\n-1.5 pts\n84.3%\n85.4%\n-1.1 pts\n83.3%\n83.2%\n+0.1 pts\nUS Transborder\nRPMs\n858\n739\n+16.1%\n2,992\n2,588\n+15.6%\n8,987\n7,782\n+15.5%\nASMs\n1,090\n930\n+17.2%\n3,539\n3,074\n+15.2%\n10,806\n9,396\n+15.0%\nLF\n78.7%\n79.5%\n-0.8 pts\n84.5%\n84.2%\n+0.3 pts\n83.2%\n82.8%\n+0.4 pts\nAtlantic\nRPMs\n2,092\n1,857\n+12.7%\n6,792\n6,028\n+12.7%\n14,593\n12,916\n+13.0%\nASMs\n2,389\n2,074\n+15.2%\n7,640\n6,781\n+12.7%\n17,338\n15,514\n+11.8%\nLF\n87.6%\n89.6%\n-1.9 pts\n88.9%\n88.9%\n0.0 pts\n84.2%\n83.3%\n+0.9 pts\nPacific\nRPMs\n1,230\n1,086\n+13.3%\n3,877\n3,460\n+12.1%\n10,335\n9,409\n+9.8%\nASMs\n1,413\n1,265\n+11.7%\n4,318\n3,861\n+11.8%\n11,939\n10,748\n+11.1%\nLF\n87.1%\n85.8%\n+1.3 pts\n89.8%\n89.6%\n+0.2 pts\n86.6%\n87.5%\n-0.9 pts\nLatin America & Caribbean\nRPMs\n294\n276\n+6.5%\n1,195\n1,072\n+11.5%\n4,393\n3,947\n+11.3%\nASMs\n381\n340\n+12.1%\n1,389\n1,239\n+12.1%\n5,180\n4,627\n+12.0%\nLF\n77.1%\n81.1%\n-4.1 pts\n86.0%\n86.5%\n-0.5 pts\n84.8%\n85.3%\n-0.5 pts\nAir Canada is Canada's largest domestic and international airline serving more than 190 destinations on five continents.
