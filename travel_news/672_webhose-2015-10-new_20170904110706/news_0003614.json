Check out this Locals Only Mini-Documentary that gets to know the ' Gateway to the West' through a local lens. And be sure to check out Aaron's local guide below. \n\nName: Aaron Phillips \nPlace you live: St. Louis, Missouri \nCan you sum up St. Louis? St. Louis is a smaller city, but huge on culture and community. There are so many interesting and fun things to do in St. Louis. There is always some type of festival happening all the time. St. Louis has some great history and anyone who lives here would love to tell you about it, we're proud of our city. \nTell us about the video you created: The video I made is a showcase of St. Louis and all the great things it has to offer. A lot of people overlook St. Louis, but it is a great city and a great place to live and work. I wanted to show some of the lesser known places around the city, and all the cool neighborhoods that you can explore. \nOccupation? Full-time college student/aspiring filmmaker and coffee connoisseur. \nPreoccupation? Short films, storytelling, and any documentary I can find. \nWhat is your perfect day in St Louis? My perfect day would consist of grabbing some coffee from Rise and taking a walk around Forest Park . Then a nice walk around the zoo or checking out some exhibits at the history museum would fill up the afternoon before meeting up with some friends for a coffee tasting and a movie. \nWhat is the best thing about St Louis? One of the best things about St. Louis is that most of the big things to do around the city are free. You can experience the zoo, the art, science, and history museum all for free, including Forest Park and a lot of other things around the city, all without spending any money. \nWhat is the worst? The amount of construction happening at any point in time is obscene. Stay off the highways and take the side streets, and you'll be fine, and it will make your trip a lot more interesting. \nWhat would be surprising about St. Louis to an outsider? I think most people would be surprised by the amount of things to do outside of downtown. Unlike many cities, St. Louis offers more in the neighborhoods. \nIf St. Louis was a person or character who would it be? St. Louis would be Stan Musial , a Cardinals baseball player during the 40's, 50's, and 60's. He was a great baseball player, and an even better person, willing to help any body he met, and really loved St. Louis and the community. Just like Stan, St. Louis is a smaller city with a lot of focus on community and loving your neighbor. (Not to mention our city's love for baseball.) \nWho are your favorite filmmakers right now? As always, Wes Anderson. Also, Casey Neistat, and a couple of filmmakers under the name Gnarly Bay. \nBe sure to check out GlobalYodel.com for more travel tips and local secrets. \nFollow Global Yodel on Twitter: www.twitter.com/globalyodel More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:35:25.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
