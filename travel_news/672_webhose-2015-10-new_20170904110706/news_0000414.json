The turbocharger comprises two primary components: turbines and compressors. An automotive turbocharger uses air from the exhaust. When this air strikes the blades of the turbine in a turbocharger, it causes the turbine to rotate, boosting the intake of air. A compressor connected to the turbine through a shaft sucks in this air and compresses the air using centrifuge. The compressed air then passes through a charge-air cooler and enters the intake manifold of the engine. The compressed air enables the engine to burn more fuel in an efficient manner, which enhancing fuel efficiency and produces extra power.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global automotive turbocharger market to grow at a CAGR of 10.06% over the period 2014-2019.\nCovered in this report\nThis report covers the present scenario and growth prospects of the global automotive turbocharger market for the period 2015-2019.
