Seychelles, one of the most exotic travel destinations in the African continent is a cluster of 115 islands, and is in close proximity with Madagascar. The independent African state with the lowest population, the country is famous for its colourful culture, diverse activities, world’s best beaches, island hopping, exotic flora and fauna, heart-touching music and lip-smacking cuisine. The account was awarded to TSBI following a multi-agency pitch.\nSeychelles Tourist Office, India’s mandates require TSBI to be responsible for creating brand awareness and leveraging the overarching positioning of ‘Another World’ across digital platforms by creating engaging content and building interactive campaigns, involving bloggers, influencers and travellers.\nThe social media campaign has been launched to enable Seychelles Tourist Office, India to reach the affluent online Indian. With the world looking towards India as the major tourist source market, Seychelles believes in making the most of the same especially because the internet medium is one of the tourist office’s larger customer-reach-out initiative. The tourist office’s aim is to make Seychelles synonymous to the best and most beautiful holidaying destination for the Indian tourist.\nSpeaking about the same Ms. Lubaina Sheerazi, COO Blue Square Consultants, Seychelles Tourist, India said, “With the growing online community in India that proves to the game changer in the global tourism industry, we hope to cash in the trend and create an effective image of Seychelles amongst the Indian Traveller. Seychelles’ positioning, ‘Another World’ will be at the core of all the campaigns and the content that will be made for the target audience. We’re excited to work with TSBI as they bring both the aptitude and attitude that Seychelles requires at the moment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:09:24.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
