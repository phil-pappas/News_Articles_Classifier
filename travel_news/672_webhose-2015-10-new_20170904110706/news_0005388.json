(NASDAQ: HA) (\"Holdings\" or the \"Company\"), parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (\"Hawaiian\"), today reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2015.\nGAAP net income of $70.0 million or $1.15 per diluted share. Adjusted net income of $78.4 million or $1.29 per diluted share, an increase of $28.9 million or $0.50 cents per diluted share year-over-year. Adjusted pre-tax margin of 20.0% compared to 12.6% in the prior year period. Unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $611 million . Achieved leverage target at 3.1x. \"We're pleased with our third quarter results and with the outlook for the remainder of the year,\" said Mark Dunkerley , Hawaiian Airlines president and chief executive officer. \"Lower fuel prices and strong demand in each of our geographies is more than making up for the growth in industry capacity between the US west coast and Hawai'i and the strength of the US dollar. Meanwhile, by our high standards we've had a disappointing summer operationally. The combined effects of a gate shortage at Honolulu resulting in part from airport construction and an abrupt change in air traffic control procedures lengthening our flights led to delays for our guests. I would like to thank all of the great employees at Hawaiian since, throughout it all, they've worked incredibly hard to mitigate the impact of these external challenges.\"\nStatistical data, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2015 the Company had:\nUnrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $611 million . Outstanding debt and capital lease obligations of approximately $914 million consisting of the following: $665 million under secured loan agreements to finance a portion of the purchase price for 11 Airbus A330-200 aircraft. $123 million under secured loan agreements to finance a portion of the purchase price for 15 Boeing 717-200 aircraft. $97 million in capital lease obligations to finance the acquisition of an Airbus A330-200, two Boeing 717-200 aircraft and aircraft-related equipment. $26 million under floating rate notes to finance the acquisition of two Boeing 767-300 ER aircraft. $3 million of convertible senior notes. In the third quarter, the Company repurchased $1 million (principal balance) of its convertible senior notes outstanding. Repurchases to date have totaled $83 million (principal balance) or 96% of the originally issued principal amount, thereby eliminating the need for the Company to issue 10.5 million shares of its common stock when the notes may have otherwise converted to common stock.\nIn addition, during the third quarter the Company repurchased 0.9 million shares of its common stock for approximately $20 million for a year-to-date total of 1.6 million shares and $38 million under its previously announced $100 million stock repurchase program.\nThird Quarter 2015 Highlights\nOperational\nRanked #1 nationally for on-time performance for the months of June and July 2015 . Product and loyalty\nThe comprehensive interior retrofit of the Company's neighbor island fleet remains on schedule for completion by the end of 2015 with 14 of 18 Boeing 717 aircraft completed at the end of the third quarter.

This line item includes the unrealized amounts of fuel and interest rate derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts. Excluding the impact of these derivative adjustments allows investors to better analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented below.
