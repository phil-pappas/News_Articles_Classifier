Fleetwood, the then-England under-18 captain, was beaten in a play-off at the 2008 finals in Abu Dhabi behind Stiggy Hodgson. Seven years on, and ahead of his appearance at the Portugal Masters, he attended the welcome dinner for the 12 boys and nine girls on the eve of this year’s Championship at Quinta do Lago. “I still speak to the people I played against,” Fleetwood said. “It may be a small field but this makes it so competitive. It’s a prestigious event and I wish I could say that I had won it.” The 2015 finals, which this year celebrates its 30th anniversary, couldn’t have been timed better given that Matthew Fitzpatrick, the 2012 Telegraph champion , lifted the British Masters at the weekend. Fleetwood said that although Fitzpatrick had perhaps “exceeded expectations” in his rising professional career, the success of past Telegraph competitors – 2011 runner-up Jimmy Mullen, for example, was a standout at the Walker Cup, while 2013 girls' champion Alice Hewson has won twice on the collegiate circuit in the last month – was in part down to a transition in English junior golf. “You don’t have players who stay amateur forever now,” he said. “England Golf has tended to players earlier and we are now perhaps the best example of this [in the world].” The 54-hole strokeplay finals get under way on Wednesday morning on Quinta do Lago’s redesigned North Course. Bath’s Jamie Li, below, will be competing in his third straight Finals, while Mark Flynn will be aiming to follow in Fleetwood’s footsteps as a fellow Formby Hall member. Meanwhile, Louisa Brunt returns after finishing fifth last year in the girls’ event. The 21 finalists enjoyed a practice round on Monday before taking part in Tuesday's Am-Am competition. Rain had been forecast but sun and a light win enveloped the course making for fine conditions.
