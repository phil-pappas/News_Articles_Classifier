To see the beauty of the Mediterranean sea, the Bitas tour (Sardinian International Active Tourism Exchange) dived at dawn in the wonders of the sea. Sociable races played with the visitors in a sensory tub; a gentle sea turtle wounded by seagulls and beached in Sardinia (and now hospitalized in the aquarium) showed its viewers all its beauty. A sensory journey suitable for all types of visitors: children, adults and also blind people, that can enjoy the trail by smelling the scents of the sea, and listening to the guide. Touch by hand fishes and shapes resembling some species and with your ears you can listen to the sound of the seaside. A structure studied to be part of the landscape, made by local material only (as granite or marble) that seems to stretch over the seaside: from each window you can see the blue of the Mediterranean. An entire section, organized in collaboration with the Archaeological Museum, offers historical artifacts on the seabed that enrich the 300 species of fishes held in the aquarium, 90 percent of which are from the Mediterranean and a small part coming from tropical climates. Octopuses, shellfishes, a sea bass and sharks but also sea horses and tropical fishes.\nMeanwhile at the Palmasera Village Resort the buyers inaugurated the Workshops. At the theater of Cala Gonone, Sandro Mezzolani (cartographer and hiker) and Alessio Saba (Forestry Agency) invited the audience to leave their cars aside and to enjoy the nature that surrounds them by living it fully on foot. “The best maps are drawn by walking around the island,” recalled Mezzolani quoting the topographer Giovanni de Agostini. Keeping alive the vast number of rural paths is simple for Mezzolani, visitors should just walk the trails. This, added with a small amount of resources for indications and services, like in Corsica. Leaving your luggage at the start of your adventure and retrieving it at the ending point. This particular type of experience should be taught at school to educate the children on the primary aspect of nature, the respect of the silence. “Trails are an occasion for enlarging the touristic season and connecting with the local farmhouses, archeological sites and more”, said Saba after giving the audience a bit of advice “Tradizional GPS and a map should always accompany a responsible trekker”.\nIn the afternoon another conference took place and concerned the “Biodiversity and tourism in the Mediterranean and the case of the monk seal”. The monk seal is one of the most important species of Sardinian fauna. As the researcher, the engineer Emanuele Coppola, has travelled for 30 years in search of the monk seal in the Mediterranean sea and told several episodes regarding the mammal: from the first evidence of the specimen in Turkey and Knossos, to the famous baby seal that was caught and brought in the Trevi Fountain, died a few days later in the ’50. The monk seal inhabited in Cala Gonone and in all Sardinian sea. Nowadays the monks still lives in the Mediterranean but is no more resident in the Island.\nBut there is not only wildlife. The biodiversity of the island is linked above all to the diversity of landscapes: 75 percent of the Sardinian coast is untouched and only in Supramonte among the fauna and flora there are 56 unique species. But most of all the territory of Dorgali is the exclusive synthesis of a great heritage that includes culture, wild landscapes, wonderful crafts and culinary excellence: it is perhaps the only area of the island that offers everything in the same spot. Enhancing the tourism becomes an opportunity not to be missed. The next step is simple, promote the marine area of Orosei and incorporate it into a touristic strategy to attract the attention that a place like Dorgali truly deserves.\nThe top of the event came with the focus dedicated on the solo sailor Gaetano Mura and the record man free diver (and world champion) David Carrera.\nMura introduced a video that shows him struggling with a transoceanic sailing where strangely was not lonely and had to face a breakdown of the boat tree in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, tree that was restored by the crew, making them able to travel to their final destination. Another difficulty was filmed with the failure of a sail due to a misunderstanding with a cargo ship crossing in the Atlantic. “Here I was alone and I had to jump out of the boat, leaving it in the ocean at those temperatures and going under the hull to refloat the sail. That has been one of the most difficult challenges of my seafaring career”. But the difficulty of navigation, in addition to the little sleep (micro-sleeps up to 5 hours during the day) and the shortage of food, are paid off by the arrival at the destination and the tears of happiness demonstrating the love of this athlete for his life goal. Gaetano Mura, born in Dorgali, grew up in a country that doesn’t have the sea and the sea was chosen for passion.\nAlways a passion is what distinguishes David Carrera for which was filmed a video for RAI 2 “In one breath” directed by Luca Rosini. Just in Cala Gonone, last Tuesday the athlete has signed a new world record of 85 meters in depth in 2.23 minutes touching a sunken wreck not far from the coastline the Ugo Bassi. A passion that turns into a philosophy of life: discipline, determination, concentration and meditation.\nTomorrow the day of the award ceremony of the Adventure Race and the conclusion of the works.\nIn the next days we will prepare special thematic deepening accompanied by videos and photos to find out more sporty side of Sardinia, as well as interviews with international athletes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:40:16.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
