In addition to watching the rise of numerous new skyscrapers and encouraging a buoyant economy, the area’s administrative committee has been actively working on the development of culture. Home to more than 3,000 international and domestic financial institutions and companies, Lujiazui has about 470,000 white-collar workers concentrated in an area of 0.6 square miles. How to create a rich cultural atmosphere and provide a varied cultural life for these workers, a well-educated group with decent incomes and refined tastes, has long weighed on the minds of officials. In recent years, the Lujiazui administrative committee has strengthened its efforts to improve the cultural environment, including introducing key projects to promote the development of the cultural industry and organising a series of cultural activities and events. White-collar workers in Lujiazui can even enjoy concerts or art lectures during their lunch breaks This year, the first singing contest for white-collar employees, Voice of Lujiazui, was held and attracted a large audience. Administrators also worked with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and Shanghai Light Music Orchestra to stage performances in office buildings. White-collar workers in Lujiazui can even enjoy concerts or art lectures by professional arts groups during their lunch breaks. According to the administrative committee, more cultural spaces will be created. For example, a multifunctional hall with 1,000 seats will be built on the second floor of the 2,073ft Shanghai Tower, the tallest skyscraper in China . A 360-degree interactive video experience area will also be created in the Oriental Pearl Tower. “Some small theatres, libraries and book corners will be established in parks and office buildings in Lujiazui. \"In addition, we also talked with surrounding commercial buildings and exhibition venues such as the Super Brand Mall and Shanghai International Convention Center to rent space to hold future cultural events that will enrich the lives of white collars in this area,” said Tan Shu, an official responsible for large public events with the Shanghai Administration of Culture, Radio, Film and Television. Another highlight this year was the Lujiazui Financial Centre Cultural Festival The Lujiazui administrative committee said it would enhance support to arts groups and cultural projects in office buildings, including a reading club and Ernst and Young choir, with the aim of cultivating a collection of highquality artists. Another highlight of the second half of the year was the Lujiazui Financial Centre Cultural Festival, while a series of themed activities will be held, including a Lujiazui choral festival, outdoor arts festival and financial centre whitecollar poetry party. Lujiazui is the showcase of China’s financial industry with the highest concentration of financial institutions. It is also a charming metropolis hub with prosperous culture that suits the Lujiazui financial centre, according to local officials. • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:29:24.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
