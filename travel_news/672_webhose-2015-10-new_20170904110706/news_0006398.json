They want to be able to watch TV, surf the Internet and cook their own meals. Fleets who provide inverters should find it easier to retain drivers.\nThere are many inverters to choose from, so it's important to look for one that is programmable, durable, easy to install, and that will protect the batteries.\nAccording to Purkeys Sales and Service Engineer Larry Rambeaux , inverters should be installed in a location that is safe and convenient for the driver. Good locations include the driver's compartment or the wall of the bunk divider. When installing an inverter, make sure the proper cables are used and mounted correctly--avoid running cables too close to a heat source and secure them properly as to not have them hanging loosely.\nLarry says, \"Drivers should always be aware of what the inverter can support. They have a limited amount of AC power, unlike what you're used to at home.\" When plugging things into the inverter, keep the power limitations in mind. Microwave ovens are sold on cooking wattage, not how much power they pull. So it is important to know how many watts a microwave pulls and the limits of an inverter. A microwave may pull 1,700 watts of electricity from the batteries to produce 1,000 watts of cooking power and the inverter can only support 1,500 watts.\nIf you want to learn more about how to choose and install the best inverter for you, then visit our website .
