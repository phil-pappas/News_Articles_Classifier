Curbelo and Rep. Brown for recognizing these outstanding professionals,” said Cindy D’Aoust, acting CEO, Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). “We greatly value cruise travel specialists who create memorable vacations for the more than 22 million cruisers each year, and are thrilled to see Congress acknowledge their professionalism.”\nH. Res. 455 expresses support “for designation of the inaugural ‘Cruise Travel Professional Month’ in October,” which coincides with National Plan a Cruise Month. The resolution honors the value that cruise travel professionals offer consumers, “by providing advice on choosing the best cruise based on customers’ budget and interest, and taking the worry out of vacation planning by arranging all the details.” In the U.S., 70 percent of cruises are booked through a cruise travel professional.\nCLIA announced October as National Plan a Cruise Month. Through the multi-dimensional campaign, the cruise industry has come together to help everyone fall in love with cruising by featuring unprecedented cruise vacation offers – from chances to win dream cruise vacations each day of the month and discovering new cruises and destinations to receiving the best cruise deals and promotions.\n“National Plan a Cruise Month puts cruise vacations in the spotlight, helping travelers discover all the incredible experiences that a cruise vacation offers,” said D’Aoust. “The month also highlights CLIA’s 10,000 travel agencies and 19,000 individual travel agent members in North America who specialize in cruise travel and ensure that consumers find the best cruise option for their travel style.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:10:26.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
