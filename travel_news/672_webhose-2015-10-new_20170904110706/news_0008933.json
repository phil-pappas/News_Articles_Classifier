The global commercial aircraft market is in its second golden age marked by burgeoning order backlogs across leading industry OEMs as well as development of radical technological innovations. The market is being propelled by rapid air traffic growth being witnessed across markets & regions, especially, with the global air traffic projected to double itself by 2030, led by the APAC region, in addition, to a technological generational leap in the global aviation propulsion sector with decades of research on technological evolution by key industry players transpiring into next generation of aerospace propulsion systems with the LEAP & Geared Turbofan engine based PurePower programs from CFM & Pratt & Whitney respectively being the most prominent examples.\nThe report provides an overall SFAS score on each of the 10 companies in the Commercial Aerospace sector based on an analysis of each company’s strategic positioning & the degree of responsiveness to its internal & external environment respectively, thereby, making it especially useful for competitive & comparative analysis. The framework generates an insightful snapshot of the prevailing, overall strategic equation for each company by identifying, weighing, prioritizing & ranking strategic factors present in the internal & external environment through an Internal Factor Analysis Summary (IFAS) matrix followed by an External Factor Analysis Summary (EFAS) matrix based on their strategic significance & potential degree of impact along-with each respective company’s corresponding degree of responsiveness to those factors.\nThe framework, thus, assesses the strategic positioning & the degree of responsiveness of each company towards the present as well as emerging market & industry dynamics to be able to harness potential growth opportunities effectively by leveraging its structural & core strengths while negating threats simultaneously.\nSFAS, as a framework, thus, scores over the traditional SWOT analysis framework, in terms, of its ability to quantify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities & threats respectively based on the potential degree of effect of each strategic factor being analyzed and the company’s commensurate degree of responsiveness to that, thereby, making it much more effective for competitive assessment & analysis and from a strategic planning standpoint with the creation of a quantitative strategic snapshot on each of the companies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:49:00.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
