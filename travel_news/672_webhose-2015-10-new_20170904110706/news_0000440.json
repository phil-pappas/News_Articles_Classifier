She further stated that most destination marketing events had previously been done in Dublin, however, this time the Seychelles penetrated into the heart of Ireland to cities that are not supported on most marketing maps - and the enthusiasm and support from these areas by the travel agents was amazing. \nShe also stated that many agents supported sales to the destination in view of the excellent air access to the Seychelles from Dublin, Ireland, as Etihad and Emirates fly twice daily from this sector (4 flights per day) via their hubs in the Middle East. \nGiven that there is much turmoil in other popular destinations that the Irish generally travel to, many Irish tourists are now looking to holiday in safe and new destinations, and the Seychelles has certainly caught their eye accordingly. \n“We look forward to doing a lot more work on the Irish market, and together with the support of the agents as well as the local partners, this is very achievable,” she said. \nAt each event, there were a select number of agents that attended, and they were treated to an amazing image display of the Seychelles islands and its various products. \nIt was also reiterated that the Seychelles is an affordable destination and suited all budgets, as well as it is a safe and an ideal destination to travel to year round. \nAs more effort and more marketing is done on this market, there are signs already of a definite increase in the number of tourists from Ireland visiting the Seychelles. Year-to-date there has been an increase of 5% from Ireland. \nPHOTO (L-R): Ash Behari, Coco De Mer; Tinaz Wadia, Seychelles Tourism Board; Justin Purves, Banyan Tree Seychelles; Wendy Tan, Berjaya Hotels; Eloise Vidot, Seychelles Tourism Board & David Rakotopare, Enchanted Island; location: LIMERICK \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
