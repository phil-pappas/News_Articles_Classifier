The partnership will see the roll-out of a range of world-class cloud solutions across Etihad Airways businesses and Etihad Airways Partners.\nThe partnership is a key enabler of the aviation group’s strategic vision to offer a superior digital service by deploying cloud-first initiatives for its businesses and its guests.\nWith Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud, the airline group and its partners are empowered to create a secure, cost effective and remarkable digital guest experience. Additionally, the technology will enhance the airlines’ digital marketing capabilities to provide tailored and personalised services across the globe.\nAdobe’s solutions will enable a superior digital experience for guests including full self-service capabilities using digital devices. It provides a truly tailored offering of products and services, and greater convenience for guests as they interact with Etihad Airways and its businesses on their chosen device. Companies across the group including Etihad Airways, Alitalia and Air Berlin are already using Adobe technology, and will benefit from the group wide approach.\nEtihad Airways and its partners will use Adobe’s capabilities across Guest Experience, Global Loyalty, Cargo, Direct Sales, Marketing, Social Media and other areas of their businesses.\nRobert Webb, Chief Information and Technology Officer at Etihad Airways, said: “This technology will entirely revolutionise the digital experience for our guests as well as the business as a whole. This investment in Adobe will allow us to enable a truly superior and seamless guest experience.\n“The delivery of a cloud-based integrated solution that supports our wider vision was a critical element in our decision to select Adobe. Cloud-based systems give us cost-effective, secure and future-proofed solutions that provide cutting edge customer-focused technology.\n“As we continue to partner with world-class technology leaders, we’re working to ensure a remarkable experience for our guests, right from initial contact, through their journey and beyond.”\nPeter Baumgartner, Chief Commercial Officer for Etihad Airways, said: “The aviation group’s digital presence not only plays a vital role in establishing our brand leadership, but is also critical to the business vision. Our digital transformation plans will also be deployed in the new Midfield Terminal at the airline’s hub at Abu Dhabi Airport. This will include improvements to digital signage and mobile tracking capabilities to enhance services for guests.”\nAdobe is globally recognised as empowering businesses to deliver the right communication at the right time to the right person, across all channels. The partnership will enhance the airline’s capabilities to create tailored offerings for its guests, through a deeper understanding of their travel preferences and how they like to engage with the airline.\nPaul Robson, President of Adobe Asia Pacific, said: “We see this as a highly strategic partnership with a group that is not only renowned for its delivery of outstanding service, but is also a digital innovator. The biggest factor driving the decision for Etihad Airways was the seamless integration between the eight powerful solutions that comprise the Marketing Cloud that will enable scalability across the group’s global operations. This is typical of how customers are seeking to implement more complex, holistic solutions across the whole of the business rather than deploy just point products.”\nThe partnership also delivers enablement training for hundreds of Etihad Airways employees and those of its partners who will be involved in the digital transformation of their businesses. The training will provide an opportunity to boost the wider digital skillset of staff in areas such as analytics, cross-channel campaign management and social media measurement from the headquarters in Abu Dhabi.\nRobert Webb added, “A key element of Etihad Airways’ equity investment strategy is to share best practice across the partner airlines, while seeking business and cost efficiencies. This strategic agreement with Adobe is a great example of that strategy in action.”\nSource:- Etihad Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:33:45.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
