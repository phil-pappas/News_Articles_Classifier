Since then, Travelport has supported the distribution of SNCF rail products and services and enabled travel agents and tour operators to sell the full range of SNCF’s content, in France and over Europe.\nEmmanuel Bourgeat, Country Manager for Travelport in France, commented: “To meet the constantly changing needs of the traveler, travel agents must be able to access a comprehensive range of content within a fully integrated, advanced and user-friendly platform. SNCF’s content is key for our customers in Europe and our travel commerce platform will provide them with even more choice of content and empowered selling. We are also very proud to renew our partnership with SNCF, a leading rail operator in Europe.”\nLaurent Bijaoui, Directeur National des ventes agences de voyages SNCF, said: “Travel agencies represent a strategic channel for SNCF and an important part of our growth plans. In that framework, partnering with Travelport is instrumental to offer modern and efficient tools, supporting travel agencies growth, both in France and internationally. We are confident that, in future, Travelport’s travel agencies will be booking SNCF products even faster and more easily than ever before thanks to Travelport distribution solutions. And the future starts now.”\nTravelport and SNCF will jointly present the new distribution agreement during the International French Travel Market Top Resa in Paris, from 29 September to 2 October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:22:23.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
