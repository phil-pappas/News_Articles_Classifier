We are confident that our first development launched with Dream will pave (the way) for a strong growth story for both parties, as well as rewarding returns for our buy-to-lease investors,” said Chris Comer, CEO of Castlewood Group. \n\nThe group also plans to develop up to 20 more new hotels in Asia over the next 10 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:55:01.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
