Supplied \nBishop, left, and Whitten donating clothing to Fijian school principal, Marth, in Vitogo. \n\"We wanted to see the other side of Fiji - all the bad stuff as well. \n\"We chose to visit a local village and we just fell in love with the children there,\" she said. \nThey took over five bags of clothing which their own children had grown out of. \nThe two Palmerston North mothers said they were shocked by the little amount of clothing and toys the Fijian children had. \nWhitten hopes to create a scheme to regularly send clothing, toys and school necessities over to Vitogo. \n\"The plan is to collect as much as we can and take it all over there.\" \n\"We want children's books, shoes, pencils, hats, glasses - just school things which every child needs. Ad Feedback \n\"Even the basics like nappies and bras are needed. All the small things in life that we take for granted,\" she said. \nWhitten hopes to donate the goods to the school and eventually head over to Fiji herself, to teach English and sport. \n\"I want to get people to donate the things they simply throw out so we can help enhance the learning of others.\" \nWhitten, who was a founder of Smiling Straight Dental Trust in the Manawatu region, said the tooth decay some of the Fijian children had was \"truly shocking\". \nMoving to Fiji to assist volunteer dental work could be something to work towards in the future, she said. \nShe hopes to head back to Fiji before March next year and take over as much clothing and school tools for the children as possible. \nBartender Shelley Bishop said her experience in Fiji was a \"real eye opener\". \nVitogo's school had about 200 children which ran from kindergarten to year eight. \nThere was a big sports field in front of the school, but the children had no toys or balls to kick around, Bishop said. \n\"I was a little bit heartbroken to see the kids running around with no shoes on.\" \nBishop said members of the Ashhurst community had already donated four boxes of toys to send to Fiji. \nTo donate items please contact: Mara Whitten at msmaramoo@icloud.com or 06 326 8308 - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:20:38.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
