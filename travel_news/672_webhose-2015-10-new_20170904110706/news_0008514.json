Alaska is the launch customer of Space Bins. \n\"Alaska is relentlessly focused on making the travel experience better,\" said Sangita Woerner, Alaska Airlines vice president of marketing. \"We've been on a mission to improve our cabin experience for several years and Space Bins are part of a $150 million investment we've made to make flying more comfortable and enjoyable. By the end of 2017, nearly half of our fleet will have larger bins to accommodate a carry-on bag for virtually every customer.\" \nAlaska will take delivery of 34 Next-Generation 737s and one 737 MAX in the next two years and will also begin retrofitting 34 aircraft with the Boeing Sky Interior, primarily 737-900ERs (Extended Range), in 2016. \nEach Space Bin stows six bags, two more than the current pivot bins installed on Next-Generation 737s with the Boeing Sky Interior. That's based on a standard size carry-on bag measuring 9 in x 14 in x 22 in (23 cm x 36 cm x 56 cm). \n\"We work closely with our customers to continuously enhance their airplanes so they can offer great passenger experiences,\" said Brent Walton, manager of 737 Interiors New Features for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \"We have a strong record of delivering value with innovative interior features like bigger bins that help reduce passenger anxiety about overhead storage and provide a better travel experience.\" \nWhen open, the bottom edge of a Space Bin hangs about 2 inches (5 centimeters) lower, so travelers can lift their carry-on bags more easily. The deeper bins allow more bags to be stowed and increase visibility into the back of the bins. Alaska Airlines also reports that the Space Bins, designed without a flight attendant bin assist mechanism, are easier to close. \nAlaska Airlines is installing Space Bins on all its 737-900ERs and 737 MAX aircraft currently on order and by 2017 will have 69 airplanes, or 46 percent of its passenger fleet, outfitted with Space Bins. \nBoeing's Space Bins are available as an optional feature on in-production Next-Generation 737s and 737 MAXs. Space Bins are also available for retrofit on in-service Next-Generation 737s. \nMaximum Bag Capacity Based on the 737-900ER and 737 MAX 9 \nBin Type (Introduction date) Boeing Bag Count Alaska Airlines Bag Count \nPivot Bins (2010) 132 117 Space Bins (2015) 198 174", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:41:53.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
