Russian Railways has spent more than $1 billion upgrading this crucial transportation route. The Rossiya train makes the journey in one go at various price points: private compartments for some, 40-bed carriages for others and steaming samovars of endless tea for everyone across tundra and forest. See trans-siberian.com \nThrough the outback: The Ghan from Adelaide to Darwin. Image: Supplied \nTHE GHAN, AUSTRALIA The Ghan leaves from Adelaide and pauses at iconic outback destinations such as Alice Springs and Katherine, before arriving in Darwin, taking in an epic slice of outback along the way. In 2015, a new four-day itinerary adds an extra day to the journey for an excursion to opal-mining Coober Pedy. A new Platinum Club luxury lounge and dining carriage will be exclusive to Platinum travellers. See greatsouthernrail.com.au \nVENICE SIMPLON-ORIENT EXPRESS, EUROPE In its early 20th-century heyday, royalty, diplomats and the odd spy mingled on this legendary train, immortalised in movies and murder mysteries. Elegance, old-world charm and impeccable service still provide railway romance as you're whisked to cities such as Paris, Venice, Vienna and Budapest. New for 2015 is a Nordic Adventure journey across Europe from Venice to those other canal cities, Copenhagen and Stockholm.

Image: Supplied \nGLACIER EXPRESS, SWITZERLAND Mountain railways are wondrous for both scenery and engineering. Switzerland's Glacier Express clanks at a snail's pace on a seven-hour journey between the two chic alpine resorts of St Moritz and Zermatt through more than 90 tunnels and across 291 bridges. Plunging valleys, deep gorges and soaring peaks pass by. It's hard to choose between the views of flower-filled summer meadows or icicle-draped winter forests. It's worth doing twice. See glacierexpress.ch \nEASTERN & ORIENTAL EXPRESS, SOUTH-EAST ASIA Gleaming green carriages, five-star cuisine, cabins panelled in cherrywood and 24-hour butler service: this is a considerably stylish way to travel past the jungles, rice paddies and sluggish brown rivers of Malaysia and Thailand. The signature four-day journey links Singapore and Bangkok. A new seven-day itinerary stops in the Cameron Highlands and Huay Yang. A new two-night trip now runs between Bangkok and Chiang Mai. See belmond.com \nPALACE ON WHEELS, INDIA India offers a dozen luxury trains, but the Palace on Wheels started the trend. The journey is made in the carriages of former maharajas, the restaurant serves sumptuous calorie-laden cuisine, and staff wear turbans and immaculate white tunics. The round trip from Delhi takes in top Indian sights, such as the desert cities of Jaipur and Jodhpur, the Taj Mahal and tiger-haunted Ranthambore National Park. See palaceonwheels.net \nBULLET TRAINS, JAPAN China's trains are the world's fastest, but Japan's shinkansen, meaning \"trunk line\", claim the gold standard for safety and efficiency. There's still something futuristic about this 50-year-old train experience, best enjoyed on the Tokyo-Kyoto run past Mount Fuji. A new line through the Hokuriku region opens its second section this year. Japan's next-generation magnetic levitation floating trains underwent track tests in 2013, but travellers will have to wait until 2027 to ride one at 500km/h.
