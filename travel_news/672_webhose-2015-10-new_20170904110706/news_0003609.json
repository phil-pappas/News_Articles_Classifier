Photographer's Note \nThe highlight of the Municipal Market decoration are the various stained glass in Gothic style, made with colored glasses from Germany and depicting scenes of the field. The pieces are by Conrado Sorgenicht Son, the great name of art in stained glass of São Paulo. Conrado is from a family of German stainglass maker masters of refined technique, which came to São Paulo in 1888 and founded (Conrado's father) the Conrado Stained glass and crystals. The company was responsible for the stained glass windows of Sorocabana Station, Municipal Theatre, Law School of Largo de São Francisco, the Sé Cathedral and over 300 other Brazilian churches. The making of stained glass windows from the Municipal Market demanded the Conrado five years of hard work. And in the late 80s, Conrado Sorgenicht Neto (Conrado's son) took charge of the restoration of stained glass that his father had created sixty years before. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:24:13.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
