Before peaking near $271 on Sept. 21, Tesla had surged over 38% from its Aug. 24 low. The stock's sharp retreat from last month's high has wiped out over two-thirds of this powerful recovery. Multiple support levels have been taken out along the way, but this week, Tesla finally appears to be stabilizing. The stock is attempting to bottom near a key zone. For patient Tesla investors, this positive action should increase their confidence. \nYesterday, Tesla fell for the sixth straight day as it began to test a key support zone between $220 and $215. This area includes the multi-week lows from May at the upper band. Tesla exploded to the upside after holding this level during a retest on May 7 . The lower band of support is marked by the Aug. 27 low. Once the panic selloff during the prior week settled down, the $215.50 level marked a significant low. Tesla's huge rally off the August low found solid footing here. \nTuesday morning, Tesla fell below this important zone before quickly rebounding. The stock is stabilizing just above the $220 area. For Tesla bulls, this is a positive development. The stock is now up more than 2.5% and may be in the early stages of bottom. Investors should consider purchases near $216 as relatively low-risk. A close back below this morning's early low near $211 would be a clear warning sign that a deeper pullback is ahead. If Tesla can hold above this level in the near term, a significant rebound could be on the way. \nDisclosure: This article is commentary by an independent contributor.
