This CSR program was aimed at providing these special children with an experience of seeing a plane and how the aircraft looks from within.\nThe day started with these mentally challenged children visiting the simulator for some time followed by a visit to the mock up area to see the plane from inside at the old airport. The children were welcomed by the cabin crew who showed them how to open their table, sit comfortably, fasten their seat belt etc. They were extremely delighted to eat their snacks inside a plane and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Ms. Harpreet A De Singh, Executive Director, Chief of Flight Safety, and Head Corporate Environment Management Systems, Air India, along with Ms. Suchitra Patki, President, Lions Club of Mahim, were present at the venue along with Air India officials and Members of the Lions Club to interact with the kids. Air India has always been committed towards making a meaningful contribution to the society, at large. The Lions Club of Mahim also took an active part, as they are celebrating their” Service Week” from 2nd to 8th October, 2015.\nThe Teachers and Special Attendants of Mann’s Wellness Center accompanied the children, who really squealed with delight, when they saw the aircraft simulator and were seen exchanging notes about how they flew to their dream destinations. The teachers from Mann, which provides students with basic need-based functional and vocational training were thankful to Air India for giving these children an opportunity, to fulfill a dream of seeing a plane as more than 70% of them are from a low socio economic background and have never been to an airport nor seen a plane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:29:17.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
