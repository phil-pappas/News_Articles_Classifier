Instead there are now two passes with blackout dates, with the pricier one allowing people to visit more days. The gold and silver passes cost $549 and $389, respectively, for Florida residents.\nA platinum plus pass, which has no blackout dates, is now $729 for Florida state residents, and includes admission to four Walt Disney World theme parks, two water parks and other attractions. Current passes remain valid through their expiration dates.\nIn Anaheim, California, the cost of an anytime pass to Disneyland and California Adventure parks has increased from $779 to $1,049. That pass comes with free parking and unlimited downloads of park photos, Brown confirmed. A restricted version of the pass sells for $849 but has two weeks of blackout days, including the Christmas and New Year's holiday seasons, the park's most popular dates. The blackout dates are intended to help the park manage demand during crowded peak holiday periods.\nAn anytime-anywhere pass, good any day at parks in Anaheim, California, and Florida, rose 31 per cent to $1,439.\nPrices for daily admission tickets to the parks did not change.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:39:43.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
