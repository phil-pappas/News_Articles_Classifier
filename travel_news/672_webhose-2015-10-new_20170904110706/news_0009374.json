DeMille and John Huston , it also claims the state’s biggest Day of the Dead celebration. It also can make a case for being the most authentic, since Mexico traditionally celebrates with departed loved ones at local cemeteries. The grounds host art exhibitions, dancing, music, a local artists’ display of altars, children’s arts and crafts, and a skeleton costume contest. This year’s theme is “Shamanic Visions of the Huichol,” drawn from mythology of the native Mexican culture populating the Sierra Madre Occidental Range.\nVitals: Oct. 24, noon-midnight. $20; seniors/children under 8 free until 4 p.m. 6000 Santa Monica Blvd, Los Angeles. (323) 469-1181. www.hollywoodforever.com. \nTaking back the streets: A 2.2-mile stretch of the “American Riviera” will be closed to autos and open to everyone else, including people pushing strollers, riding bicycles, skating or just ambling along the shoreline, for Santa Barbara’s third Open Streets festival. Eight free activity zones will augment the sheer exhilaration of standing, walking or rolling in streets free of fumes or traffic, and an army of zombies will arise to dance to Michael Jackson ’s “Thriller.” Oct. 24, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Free. (805) 216-1223, www.sbopenstreets.org. \nNew Borrego season: With summer gone and fall on the wane, desert season is nigh, as Borrego Springs (San Diego County) prepares its 50th annual welcome for returning snowbirds.
