Departing London Victoria on Saturday 5th December, the festive journey, in the nostalgic 1920s carriages of this luxury train, is set to be filled with music, magic and family entertainment as the train travels through the Kent countryside.\nThe Big Local Community Choir, from Bermondsey, London will send this journey off in style with performances of favourite carols and festive tunes at Belmond’s private check-in lounge at London Victoria.\nAboard the elegant carriages, bedecked with baubles and wreaths, families are treated to a festive lunch served by livered stewards whilst musicians and magicians keep all ages entertained. For this magical new event, Belmond has partnered with children’s party experts Sharky and George, purveyors of good honest fun, who will entertain children with an unending series of traditional games and crafts along with some seasonal surprises.\nThe Festive Express journey is part of a varied Christmas programme aboard both Belmond British Pullman and Belmond Northern Belle, sister trains of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express. Each December, both UK day trains operate a full programme of Christmas lunch, dinner and day trips to cities such as Bath and Canterbury for carol singing and Christmas shopping. These festive trips are available between the 1st – 19th December departing from London Victoria (Belmond British Pullman) and regional cities (Belmond Northern Belle), such as Bath, Bristol, Chester, Cardiff, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester and Newcastle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:37:03.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
