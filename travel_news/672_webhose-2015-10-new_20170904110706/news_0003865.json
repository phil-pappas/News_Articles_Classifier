According to the company that helps holidaymakers save money on their airport car parking needs, more people need to claim compensation.\nEach year tens of thousands of people turn to Trip Advisor and other travel sites to complain about holidays from hell. However, not many of them understand that they can claim compensation for distress that has been caused.\nChris Fryer from UK Airport Car Parks said: “When a person pays for a holiday they should expect the best possible holiday ever. If that holiday were not what they expected, then they should seek compensation.”\nThere are many things a person can claim for if the holiday does not live up to their expectations. These are listed at http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/blog/holiday-compensation-claims\nTravel agents and travel companies are trained to avoid compensation claims. When a person complains about a problem with their holiday, they will receive a nice letter and maybe receive a small discount coupon for their next holiday. According to UK Airport Car Parks ( http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk ) that is not enough.\nThe travel experts would like to see travel companies take complaints more seriously instead of trying to reduce the compensation they pay out. If a person is not happy with the compensation they receive from a travel company after a complaint is made, they should seek legal advice.\nTo learn more about saving money on Airport car parking at Manchester Airport, Gatwick Airport, and other airports, please visit http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/car-parking/manchester or to learn the secrets in finding cheap easyJet flights, please visit http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/blog/how-to-find-cheap-easyjet-flights-for-your-holiday\nAbout Ukairportcarparks.co.uk\nUkairportcarparks.co.uk provides holidaymakers with a trusted and affordable airport parking, airport hotel and airport lounge solution.\nMedia Contact:\nUK Airport Car Parks\nYork, YO1 9RA\n0774 059 4552\nEmail: This\nWeb: http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk", "external_links": ["http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/blog/how-to-find-cheap-easyjet-flights-for-your-holiday", "http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/blog/holiday-compensation-claims", "http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/car-parking/manchester"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:09:04.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
