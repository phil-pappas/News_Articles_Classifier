Hilton Head Island was recognized with the prestigious award for its more than 30 championship golf courses, 24 of which are open to the public, making Hilton Head Island a golfer’s paradise.\nSculpted by some of golf’s most preeminent architects, including Robert Trent Jones Sr., Pete Dye and Jack Nicklaus, each Hilton Head Island golf course delivers its own unique set of challenges and scenic fairways. The Island’s sub-tropical climate and lush fairways attract golfers from around the world resulting in 700,000 rounds of golf played annually.\nHilton Head Island’s golf courses attract both amateur and professional golfers with certified lessons and renowned tournaments.

Each operator is asked to nominate the best performing golf destinations enjoyed by their clients, resulting in five Golf Destination of the Year winners from each of the five regional categories – North America, Latin America & Caribbean, Europe, Africa & Gulf States & Indian Ocean, Asia and Australasia. Criteria under consideration include customer satisfaction, quality of courses and accommodation, value for money, professional conduct of suppliers, support from local tourism industry and accessibility to tee times.\nFor golf aficionados and leisure travelers alike, Hilton Head Island is conveniently located off the Atlantic Coast of South Carolina, approximately 45 miles north of Savannah, Ga., 90 miles south of Charleston, S.C., and 30 miles south of historic Beaufort, S.C.
