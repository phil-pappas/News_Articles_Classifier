Picture: Transportation Security Administration\nLeah McLennan news.com.au I’VE taken some pretty stupid things on to a plane — giant lamp shades, a portable baby cot and bags of groceries.\nBut that pales in comparison to what America’s Transport Security Administration regularly finds in people’s belongings.\nLast week they collected a record 67 firearms from carry-on bags across the US — and 56 of those guns were loaded.\nThey also found a bunch of throwing stars, 19 stun guns and Tasers, and a canister of gun powder.\nIt may come as a surprise to Australians, but the TSA says “you can travel with your firearms in checked baggage”, but they must first be declared to the airline.\nThe TSA also allows passengers to transport ammunition, but only in checked baggage.\nIt also frequently reminds passengers that any items that look like a real bomb, grenade or mine are prohibited.\nThis may sound like common sense, but a 15-year-old boy caused chaos recently when he entered a Canadian airport with a bomb-shaped alarm clock in his carry-on bag.\nThe teenager, who was travelling from Toronto to Vancouver, was pulled aside after a screening officer noticed the object in his luggage.\nWould you pack this in you carry on luggage? Teenager thought it was a good idea yesterday at Pearson airport. pic.twitter.com/zQDIsbYHpX\n— Peel Regional Police (@PeelPoliceMedia) September 6, 2015 The explosive disposal unit was dispatched to Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, the screening area was shut down, and the surrounding area was evacuated for about three hours.\nThe device tweeted earlier was an alarm clock, but officials at the airport have to take all precautions. Charges laid. Lesson learnt\n— Peel Regional Police (@PeelPoliceMedia) September 6, 2015 But the case of the Canadian teenager and his “funny” alarm clock is far from being an isolated incident.\nHere are some ridiculous items people have tried to take on planes:\n1. An avalanche starter\nDon’t forget your avalanche starter. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied\nA homemade avalanche control charge was discovered in a carry-on bag in 2014 at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, a major airport in the US state of Alaska. The FBI responded and arrested the passenger.\n2. Grenades\nTravellers try to take all sorts of ‘amusing’ grenades on their holiday. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied\nMore than 140 inert or novelty handgrenades were discovered last year by the TSA in both checked and carry-on bags.\n3. Axes and mallets\nDon’t leave home without your mallet. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied\nDouble check your bag for axes or mallets. The TSA found this homemade wooden mallet in a passenger’s carry-on last year.\n4. A meat slicer\nIf you like you meat thinly sliced then take your own slicer with you. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied\nA meat slicer was discovered in a carry-on bag at the Southwest Florida International Airport last year. Blades on slicers, blenders, and food processors are razor sharp and are prohibited from being packed in carry-on bags, says the TSA.\n5. Bear mace\nProtect yourself from bears while on holiday with a few cans of spray. Picture: Transportation Security Administration Source: Supplied\nBeware of the bears — and the repellent. It may come as no surprise, but bear repellent is just one of the many items that are not allowed on commercial flights in the US.\nJump back to top", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0ee4db66def40a8ad3d989d36bc74006", "https://twitter.com/PeelPoliceMedia/status/640576430078726144", "http://t.co/zQDIsbYHpX", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f19b01194c21bd16f7ba8a5cc20bbc42", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9037f2c1e1a7d6f3ed5c06e293dade84", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "https://twitter.com/PeelPoliceMedia/status/640575184487903232", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/deca77b125307ac44cbd2dfd3a36b105", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/aaa8739fe9953c8e1b49485935a61fbc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a092881d9b271f45f9b7d4a78519cbdf", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-22T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:19:56.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
