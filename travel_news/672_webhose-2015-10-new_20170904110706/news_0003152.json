Their DC power units drive quick rise times, and battery-powered mobile column lifts provide heavy-duty technicians with complete portability. All battery-powered lifts work during power outages, so there is never any risk that a vehicle will be left stranded in the air.\nInfo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/274939-INFO\nThere is one other important advantage that battery-operated lifts offer over traditional wired lifts: the ability to adapt the lift to a specific application using the right battery type. Advances in battery technology have made it possible for facilities to tailor their battery-operated lifts to meet specific needs. For instance, some battery types are more suited for quick service applications than others.\nWhat options are available for lift buyers today? Rotary Lift, the vehicle lift manufacturer that offers more battery-operated models than any other lift maker, provides expert guidance.\n\"Rotary Lift revolutionized the market in 2011 with the introduction of patent-pending Shockwave technology that makes its battery-powered two-post surface and inground lifts the fastest in the world. Shockwave technology is now also available on our light-duty four-post and alignment lifts,\" says Doug Spiller , heavy-duty product manager for Rotary Lift. \"On the heavy-duty side, our battery-powered Mach ™ Series mobile column lifts have long been preferred by heavy-duty customers for their speed and ease of use, and last year we introduced fast heavy-duty four-post lifts with DC power units. We know what it takes to build an efficient battery-powered lift, and recognize the significant impact choosing the right battery type and style can make for the customer.\"\nRotary Lift engineers thoroughly cycle test lifts with a variety of battery types at Rotary Lift's North American headquarters in Madison, Indiana , and also monitor the performance of lifts in use in vehicle service facilities. Based on extensive research, they recommend two types of batteries for vehicle lifts:\nAbsorbent Glass Mat (AGM): While AGM battery technology is not new, its cost has only recently come down enough to make these batteries feasible for installation in vehicle lifts. AGM batteries are maintenance-free and offer longer battery life at faster cycle rates; however, they should be connected to an AGM-compatible charger to maximize their potential. For frequent-use, quick service settings where a vehicle is fully raised and lowered at least once every 15 minutes, AGM batteries may be worth the higher initial investment.\nFlooded Lead-Acid: These standard batteries have wet cells that require monitoring and maintenance, but they offer an economical option for customers.\nOnce a customer has determined the type of battery, he or she can then choose the style of battery that fits the particular service.\nDeep Cycle Style: Deep cycle marine batteries are the most commonly used batteries for mobile column lifts. That's because they can operate for days or weeks between charges, meaning the mobile column does not have to be plugged in continually. This enables technicians to move the lift to a location that is convenient for the vehicle being lifted and then leave the lift in place for an extended period of time. Constant charging applications will typically shorten the lifespan of deep cycle batteries.\nStarting Style: Standard car and light truck batteries are economical and powerful, providing the best bang for the buck for light-duty lifts under normal operation. They are ideal for facilities that can benefit from fast rise times, but that do not typically cycle the lift every 15 minutes. Automotive batteries should be continuously charged. Continuous cycling without a charger can damage these batteries.\nEach of Rotary Lift's battery-operated lifts comes with a smart digital charger that works with any of these styles and types of batteries. The charger not only senses the battery type, discharge rate and how close the battery is to fully charged, but also the ambient temperature, which can affect charge settings.\n\"Some lift manufacturers ship all lifts with a basic charger and pre-determined battery installed, which limits the customer's ability to choose the right type for his or her application,\" says Spiller. \"At Rotary Lift, we have learned that it is best to give the customer flexibility. That's why our standard charger works with all of the popular lift battery options. All of our lifts can be shipped without batteries, enabling the customer to determine which style and type should be installed. Customers should consult their owners manuals for size and amp requirements.\"\nTo learn more about Rotary Lift battery-operated, heavy-duty lifts, visit www.rotarylift.com/original .
