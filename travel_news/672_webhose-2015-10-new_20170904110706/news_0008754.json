The aim of this week’s fact-finding visit is to familiarise the travel agents with the island of Ireland and our superb tourism offering, so that when they return home they will be even better informed to advise their clients when planning and booking their holidays.\nThe group’s itinerary – designed by Fáilte Ireland – included Newgrange and Dublin, with tours of St Patrick’s Cathedral, the Old Jameson Distillery and the Little Museum of Dublin. They also visited Glendalough and Powerscourt House and Gardens.\nIn 2014, we welcomed 291,000 Spanish visitors to the island of Ireland, up +11% on the previous year. Barbara Wood, Tourism Ireland’s manager in Spain, said: “Spain is an important market for tourism to the island of Ireland and 2015 looks set to be another strong year for Spanish visitors, with the most recent CSO figures showing an increase of +14% for the June-August period . We are determined to ensure that growth continues. We have a really extensive autumn campaign in full swing right now – aimed at boosting late-season travel to Ireland from Spain. Working with travel agents and tour operators, and inviting them to come and experience what’s on offer here, is a key element of that programme. Our aim is that when they return home, the travel agents will be even more enthusiastic about the destination, helping to secure a greater share of their business for Ireland.”\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:13:48.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
