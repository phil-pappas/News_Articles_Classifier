Today's interview is with Jason Montague, president and chief operating officer of Prestige Cruise Holdings, the parent company of Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Oceania Cruises. What is the biggest challenge for the cruise industry and your brands going forward? Within the upscale and luxury cruise markets we place a premium on marketing and education, so both travel agents and consumers can recognize the value proposition both Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises offer. Regent is the most inclusive luxury experience on the market and at Oceania we recently added more inclusive elements like shore excursions, as part of our OLife Advantage early booking program, so it’s important that agents and guests are aware and understand the inherent value we offer. \nWhat are your plans regarding product and distribution for 2016? Next year is an exciting one for both brands as each welcomes a new ship to its respective fleet. In April, Oceania Cruises debuts Sirena , a 684-guest ship that we are investing $40 million to completely refurbish. As part of that investment, Sirena will feature new dining experiences and completely re-designed Owner’s and Vista Suites. On the Regent side we will launch Seven Seas Explorer in July. We are sparing no expense to make Explorer the most luxurious ship ever built. \nWhat do you wish travel agents better understood about working with you and or your brand? Due to the inclusive nature of our product, not only do we provide guests with an incredible vacation value, but we create tremendous earning potential for travel agents. We have a full sales team that is dedicated to helping our travel partners succeed, and we’re open to any ideas our partners may have to help increase sales. We believe that for Oceania and Regent to succeed our travel partners need to succeed, so our approach with agents is very collaborative. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:07:32.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
