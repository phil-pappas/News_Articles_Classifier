This is the third time that Dominican Republic has been recognized by IAGTO as an exceptional destination for the sport, with its magnificent golf courses bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean where golfers can enjoy both facilities of the highest caliber and a warm climate that allows for a unique and challenging play experience.\n \nDominican Republic is honored to be recognized for the third time by the prestigious International Association of Golf Tour Operators as Latin America and the Caribbean’s top golf destination.\n \n“Dominican Republic is delighted to receive this award once again from such a prestigious organization,” said Isabel Vasquez, director of the Dominican Republic Ministry of Tourism (MITUR) for the Iberian Peninsula. “This award speaks to our unrelenting commitment to provide both the infrastructure and first class services in our hotels and golf courses in order to maintain the loyalty and happiness of those who choose to visit us, allowing us to reinforce our position as the Golf Capital of the Caribbean with 28 courses; the largest offerings in all Latin America and the Caribbean.”\n \nGolf tourism’s contribution to the Dominican economy is estimated at over US$200 million annually – a figure that is projected to increase over the next year, according to a study by IAGTO North America. In 2014, this same study revealed the growth of this niche market was 10 percent – an arrival of more than 140,000 golfers who visited the Dominican Republic only to play golf.\n \nDominican Republic is home to some of the most dramatic and spectacular golf courses in the world designed by legends such as Pete Dye, PB Dye, Jack Nicklaus, Robert Trent Jones, Gary Player and Tom Fazio. It boasts 28 courses, with 68 ocean-view holes, of the highest standards of design, and friendly services of five-star quality. Among these are Punta Espada Golf Club in Cap Cana, La Cana at Puntacana Resort & Club, Teeth of the Dog and Dye Fore at Casa de Campo, each featuring stunning views and unique challenges carefully crafted by the best designers in the golf world.\n \nIAGTO’s tour operators generate more than 85 percent of the world’s golf vacations. Its 592 members hailing from 61 different countries selected the 2016 winners. Judges nominated the best golf destinations based on the different experiences of their customers and criteria such as customer satisfaction, quality of golf courses and accommodations, price, professional conduct of suppliers, support of the local tourism industry and accessibility to playtime.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:19:16.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
