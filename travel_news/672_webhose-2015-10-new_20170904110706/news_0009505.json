Sure, there have always been isolated haunts like Harry’s Bar for a Bloody Mary and the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz for a great martini. But in the last few years, cocktails — shaken and stirred, curated and crafted, frozen and slushed, one more outrageous and sophisticated than the other — have invaded and conquered. To celebrate the victory, Doni Belau, who writes a Paris travel guide , visited 55 bars in six weeks — and culled her sips and findings into the recently released book “ Paris Cocktails ” ($18, Cider Mill Press). Belau starts with some of the rules of French cocktail culture: “Do clink glasses with everyone in the group, wishing each other ‘Santé’ (to health);” “Do not open the champagne before your guest of honor enters.” (O.K., champagne has not completely lost its place in the City of Light.) What follows is a delicate balance of chic and kitsch references — cosmos and at least one “Midnight in Paris” mention make an appearance — and no shortage of drinks inspired by French artists (Picasso), writers (Flaubert) and revolutions (1789), shared by some of the city’s finest mixologists. Below, and in honor of Paris Fashion Week , Belau shares a recipe from her book. De la Bretagne “De la Bretagne was created at Copper Bay, a beautiful Parisian bar, and makes for the perfect fall craft cocktail using products from Brittany. This darling spot with a maritime feel is owned by two gals and a guy — Elfi, Aurélie and Julien — who are all friends and fellow bartenders.” Photo At Copper Bay in Paris, the De la Bretagne.
