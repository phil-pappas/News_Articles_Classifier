To get in on the fun, the B Resort & Spa in Orlando has a romantic getaway package for couples crazy about football.\nThe Gridiron Countdown package includes a king guest room, a bottle of Champagne and chocolate truffles, a romantic three-course meal at American Q, breakfast in bed and late check-out. And, while they aren’t romancing, couples can always watch their favorite football team on their in-room, flat-screen TVs.\nB Resort’s American Q has an industrial, farmhouse-chic vibe and the showpiece of the restaurant is a 1950s cherry-red, Ford F1 pickup. The truck’s flatbed houses an all-you-can-eat appetizer and salad buffet. Contributed Rates start at $169 a night (two-night minimum required) and the offer is good through Nov. 30.\nFor reservations or more details, visit www.bhotelsandresorts.com .\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/01/2e/ba/B-Resort-Spa-American-Q-Truck.jpg", "http://www.bhotelsandresorts.com/b-walt-disney-world/"], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:14:23.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
