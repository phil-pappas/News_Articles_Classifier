Kathleen Lavine / Denver Business Journal Frontier Airlines is showing progress in flying on time — a major goal of the Denver-based carrier, which has grappled with grumpy customers — but the latest federal numbers still show the airline performing poorly on passenger complaints. September numbers from FlightView, a private provider of airline and airport data, show Frontier arriving on time 85.4 percent of the time last month, better than all but four out of 26 U.S. carriers tracked by the company. The Frontier Airlines ticketing counters at Denver International Airport. Kathleen Lavine / Denver Business Journal That compares to the 77.1 percent on-time rate for Frontier in August, as reported in today's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report from the U.S. Department of Transportation ( download here ). (The DOT has not reported September on-time rates yet.) According to federal data, Frontier — the third-largest carrier at Denver International Airport — was on time 71.9 percent for the 12 months ending in August, 71.4 percent in July and 67.6 percent in June. FlightView regards arrivals within 14 minutes of schedule as on-time; DOT's standard is 15 minutes. The latest on-time numbers were good enough for Frontier's president, Barry Biffle , to crow about the airline in an emailed letter to customers and full-page newspaper ads. Biffle boasted that in September, the airline delivered \"our best on-time performance in 10 years.\" Meanwhile, today's DOT report show Frontier continues to struggle with customer complaints. The airline's complaint rate for August was 8.69 per 100,000 \"enplanements,\" or aircraft boardings — nearly four times the 2.27-per-100,000 average rate of 13 major airlines. Only Spirit Airlines — which, like Frontier, is an \"ultra low cost carrier\" with low fares and a-la-carte fees for services — posted worse customer service in August, at a rate of 15.42 complaints per 100,000 enplanements. Frontier's complaint rate for August was up from a rate of 7.5 complaints per 100,000 in July, 6.52 in June and 4.87 in August 2014. In August, Southwest Airlines — DIA's No. 1 carrier — had the third-best complaint rate of 13 major carriers, 0.58 per 100,000. United Airlines — No. 1 at DIA — was No. 10 with a complaint rate of 3.18 per 100,000. Out of 99 total customer complaints about Frontier in August, 26 were for \"flight problems,\" defined by the DOT as \"cancellations, delays or any other deviations from schedule.\" Another 21 complaints were for baggage issues, and 15 were classified as \"reservations-ticketing-boarding\" complaints, which the DOT defines as \"airline or travel agent mistakes made in reservations and ticketing; problems in making reservations and obtaining tickets due to busy telephone lines or waiting in line, or delays in mailing tickets; problems boarding the aircraft (except oversales).\" The DOT report does not cover safety or security complaints, which are filed with other agencies.
