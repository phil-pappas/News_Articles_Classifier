The tours operate daily at the Grand Canyon National Park. They are a lot of fun, so don't miss the chance to take one. Rafting Tours Fill Up Fast There's only time to run one river tour every day, so that means they're in high demand. There are even some fun options you can add onto the tour to make your day more exciting. A basic rafting tour starts out with a bus ride to the Glen Canyon Dam were your raft awaits, however, you can upgrade the tour and fly to the Dam instead and use the extra time to take a Jeep tour through the park. This tour takes you through stunning landmarks like the Horseshoe Bend. There are so many interesting things to see, you'll want to take lots of photos. The River Tour Your trip takes place on the Colorado River, and you'll float along it for 15 miles through the Grand Canyon. It goes through Horseshoe Bend and some other beautiful landing nooks along the way. The tour package includes lunch and a stop at mysterious Petroglyph Beach. This beach connects you with the ancient settler area of the Grand Canyon, so you can ground your energy before continuing along the tour. The rafts used on the tours carry 19 people, so these outings are great for groups. The trip follows some relatively smooth sections of the Colorado River, and there are no dangerous white waters to navigate. These float tours are suitable for small kids too since there are no rough waters, so don't hesitate to bring your kids for a trip they'll never forget. All the seats on the raft makes these tours ideal for big families and company outings since everyone can travel together. However, you want to book your tour in advance to make sure you reserve all the seats your group needs. Remember, you'll be outside all day, so you'll want to bring along all the essentials you'll need. Pack an extra set of clothing and some snacks in a waterproof bag so they stay dry. Make sure you bring some extra bottled water too. Don't forget about sun protection too, you'll want some sunscreen, a hat, and light clothes with long sleeves. The sun shines bright and gets hot inside the Grand Canyon, so be prepared. Wrapping Up Your tour also includes an expert guide who will make your trip even more enjoyable. Your guide will point out interesting landmarks and other sights you don't want to miss. So don't forget to book your tour early, and do it online. Don't forget that there are two options available, so if you are on a tight budget, opt for the bus ride down to the Canyon. However, if you can make the stretch for the airplane and 4x4 tour, then you won't regret it. The Grand Canyon is a vacation destination like no other. So if you're looking for adventure, look no further than the Grand Canyon and a float tour on the Colorado River. \nGrand Canyon rafting expert Lea Fallon recommends these South Rim 1-day whitewater trips and these 1-day float tours: http://www.grandcanyondaytrips.com/float-trips/   08   121  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:27:37.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
