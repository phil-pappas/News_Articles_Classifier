Taking a leisurely stroll through the streets of the South Asian coastal city imbued with exotic charms is truly a rewarding experience - flowers are in bloom, coconut trees sway gently in the breeze , fishermen are on stilts, sandy beaches extend , Buddhist pagodas and temples are dotted around, kind and friendly locals make you feel welcome, and aromas of spices waft into the nostrils.
