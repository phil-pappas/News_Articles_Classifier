It now stands at No. 38.\nDesigned by PGA Tour star and Ryder Cup captain Davis Love III, with assistance from brother Mark Love and architect Paul Cowley, the captivating Dunes Course is unlike any other venue in Los Cabos. Located six miles north of downtown Cabo San Lucas on the Baja Peninsula’s west coast, the Dunes Course, centerpiece of a 1,500-acre private resort community, is a windswept, lay-of-the-land links that rambles through colossal 50-foot-high dunes and around giant blowout bunkers as it journeys to and from the sea.\nFairways, tees and greens are carved into huge Sahara-like dunes above the Pacific Ocean, where breaching whales are a common sight during the winter months. Five sets of tees, three of them rated for women, provide admirable versatility on the Dunes Course, which is surfaced from tee to green in sustainable, salt-tolerant paspalum grass.\nNot content to rest on its laurels, Diamante brought back Love and his design team to replace the inland 12th and 13th holes with a new pair of holes (a downhill par 5 and a short par 4), each sculpted from vast white sand dunes within earshot of the thundering surf. These holes, opened last year, greatly enhance the golf experience and likely were a strong factor in the rise of the Dunes Course on the Top 100 list.\n“It’s quite an honor,” said Diamante developer Ken Jowdy of his facility’s improved ranking. “The changes at 12 and 13 certainly had quite a bit to do with it (the promotion), as we took out two inland holes and replaced them with links-style holes that fit in better with the overall theme of the course. To be ranked so prominently on GOLF Magazine’s list is a validation of everything we do. We’re thrilled.”\nJack Nicklaus, golf’s greatest champion, built the Ocean Course at Cabo del Sol on a parcel of land he described as “the best piece of golf property I’ve ever seen.” With seven holes touching a coastline marked by golden beaches washed by the turquoise-blue sea, this stellar resort layout, stretched across a rugged desert landscape and backdropped by tall stony mountains, is the course that put Los Cabos on the international golf map when it opened in 1994. Clinging to the No. 100 spot on the list, Cabo del Sol’s Ocean Course, featuring an ebb-and-flow routing that delivers players to the sea on both nines, is the most celebrated international course on Nicklaus’ extensive design resume.\n“It is an honor to once again be voted among the ‘Top 100 Courses in the World’ by the esteemed panel at GOLF Magazine,” said Greg Tallman, Cabo del Sol’s director of golf. “We take great pride in having been named to the list for the last 20+ years and, as a facility accessible to the public, we are excited to share such a great course with visitors seeking out a truly special golf experience in Los Cabos. The Ocean Course has endured the test of time and remains one of the very best golf courses in the world.”\nIt is said that great land produces great courses. Diamante (Dunes) and Cabo del Sol (Ocean) are the only courses in Mexico on GOLF Magazine’s Top 100 list, a tribute to the topographical uniqueness of the ocean-mountain-desert environment in Los Cabos.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:23:47.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
