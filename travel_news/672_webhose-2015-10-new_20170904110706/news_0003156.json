Mini-bonds were King’s response to banks’ reluctance to lend to smaller businesses. King of Shaves raised £1bn from customer bonds (minibonds) in six years. “The first priority has to be on selling. People don’t like to sell, so it’s very important to have a great product. We live in a rate-or-slate world now; a customer service and product review world. Tolerance for bad products has shrunk hugely.” The most successful businesses start with a partnership – find a partner who counter-balances your strengths The founder ought to be the salesperson, he explains, because they can transfer their enthusiasm about why they’re making this product and use it to enthuse consumers. But if you want to sell more units per week, you need more sales people. “What’s important is to have a great team around you to ‘delegreat’ – that is, to delegate to great people. The problem with SMEs is they don’t scale-up as soon as they need to.” Will King Though Mr King admits: “Finding great people is the hardest thing to do. You can find money one way or another but finding great people is like finding love.” The most successful businesses start with a partnership – find a partner who counter-balances your strengths, says Mr King. When it comes to selling your product, stay human, he insists. “In the word ‘brand’ you have the letters ‘DNA’, and in any brand there is something human; a robot hasn’t come up with the idea. The brand should always show what you – the business owner – are about.” Printers providing flexibility can streamline admin so that business owners are free to keep creative momentum He warns of sinking money into dead things such as an office. “If you’re smart you can run a business from your iPhone: register your website with godaddy.com, get it up on WordPress, set up social share accounts, download Xero for your accountancy, Keynote for your decks, sell from Shopify, use Pipeliner or SalesWise to manage your CRM and once you get a bigger team use Slack for instant messaging.” The printers in Canon’s MAXIFY range support the run-your-business- from-your-phone mentality because you can print and scan with mobile devices and because it also connects to cloud apps that owners can use to run their operations.
