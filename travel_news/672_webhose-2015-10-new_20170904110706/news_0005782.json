Timber is a £1.9 billion-a-year industry to Britain, with woodland and trees providing income for other sectors including tourism, shelter for farmers’ fields and habitats for farmers’ animals. The Woodland Trust fears that losses from ash dieback could reach the proportions of Dutch elm disease – ash is our third most common tree and supports a wide variety of other species. The Trust maintains that concerted action is needed to tackle pests and diseases Ash dieback’s impact is likely to be severely felt in the UK due to the dominance of ash in our woodlands. The ash makes up about 5.5 per cent of British woodlands compared with two per cent in continental Europe. The UK has only a small number of native trees and shrubs – about 40. Continental Europe has a much higher number but after plants returned following the most recent ice age, many did not make it back to across the newly formed English Channel. If the UK follows patterns from continental Europe, up to 48 million of the country’s 80 million ash trees could die. This, in turn, will threaten the entire future of the 44 species which only occurred on living or naturally-decaying ash trees, significantly impacting on a variety of bats, moths, butterflies, beetles, mammals, plants, fungi, invertebrates and lichen. Kent, Sussex and Norfolk are currently affected by ash dieback The Woodland Trust’s head of conservation Christine Reid says: “There are many potential impacts that aren’t necessarily obvious but so important. “Trees alongside our waterways are a good example of this. Many fish species need quite specific water temperatures to survive and the shade from trees is an important way of regulating this.” Ash trees allow more light through, which allows a variety of plants to grow beneath them The Environment Agency recently ran a pilot scheme called Keeping Rivers Cool in which they planted trees along waterways to assess the impact on species in rivers and streams. Trees also play an important role in flood prevention and preventing soil erosion. The Trust maintains that concerted action is needed by the Government, its agencies and the forestry, horticultural and conservation sectors to tackle pests and diseases, and to build resilience in our woods. Ash dieback in the Peak District Ash dieback was first found in Britain in 2012 and was confirmed in the Peak District in July 2015. It is expected to spread quickly throughout most of the national park, particularly the White Peak, over the next two years. The long-term consequence in the Peak District (above) is likely to be a loss of between 60 and 90 per cent of ash trees, with significant long-term impact on the landscapes of the White Peak plateau and dales. Such a huge loss would damage the region’s timber crop, result in a loss of biodiversity and replacement of ash woodland by non-native scrub and sycamore. Ash dieback in the Lake District Four sites in the Lake District National Park have been identified as having been infected with ash dieback . The fungus has been confirmed near the popular tourist towns of Ambleside and Keswick. About five per cent of woodland in the Lake District (above) is ash but there are also approximately 500,00 individual ash trees around the landscape – a landscape which could be severely damaged if the disease reaches mature trees in areas such as Ullswater, Borrowdale and Langdale. Ash dieback’s impact on biodiversity There are 1,058 species associated with the ash tree or ash woodland. These include 12 birds, 55 mammals, 78 vascular plants, 58 bryophytes, 68 fungi, 239 invertebrates, and 548 lichens. There are 44 species which only occur on living or naturally-decaying ash trees (obligate species). These include four species of lichen, 11 fungi and 29 species of invertebrate. There are another 62 species that are more likely to be found on ash than on other trees. Vulnerable species amongst the 44 “obligate species” include the centre-barred sallow moth. Caterpillars feed on ash, burrowing into buds when newly hatched, and feeding on flowers and leaves. This moth population has declined by 70 per cent since 1968. During the British winter, bullfinch will eat the seeds of ash trees There are another eight species of moth for which ash is classed as an important food plant. Most interesting of these is the barred tooth-striped – a UK Priority Species of Conservation Concern under Section 41 of the Natural Environment and Communities Act. Current strongholds in the UK include Kent, Sussex and Norfolk – areas which are currently most affected by ash dieback. Ash provides roosting sites in the form of tree holes, crevices and loose bark for some colonies of the tree-roosting bats. Ash trees also represent a source of food in the form of insects. Ash is an important food plant for many moth species Photo: © Butterfly Conservation Although no birds are totally dependent on ash, the seeds are a key food source for bullfinch in winter in southern England and spotted flycatchers, chiffchaffs, blackcaps and wrens are more abundant within woodland dominated by ash. Other birds such as nuthatch and lesser-spotted woodpeckers nest in the hollows of mature trees. Ash trees allow more light through than many other native trees, which allows a rich variety of plants to grow beneath them.
