Two? Three, if you’re hungry, ambitious and endowed with a steel-plated stomach?\nWhatever the answer, it should probably be fewer than 13.\nI was somewhere around No. 4 when I sat down for a “bunny chow” in Durban , on South Africa’s east coast. It’s a funny-sounding name for a funny-looking concoction: a loaf of white bread hollowed out to form an edible vessel for a generous helping of curry, typically mutton or bean.\nWhile these days such a zero-waste dish could be hailed as carbon-footprint-friendly and visionary, its genesis was strictly utilitarian. Enterprising merchants from the Gujarati bania caste within South Africa’s Indian community created takeaway counters to serve makeshift lunches to laborers. Bania food became bunny chow, the quintessential Durban Indian fast food. Or at least that’s how one origin story goes.\n“Bunny followers are as fanatical as football-club supporters,” said Erica Platter, co-author of “Durban Curry: So Much of Flavour.” “Once a Manchester supporter, never a Liverpool supporter. It’s the same with bunny dens — people almost come to blows about which is the best bunny.”\nPhoto Selling pastries by the Victory Lounge, established in the 1940s. Credit Joao Silva/The New York Times If lifelong loyalties must be sworn to your very first team, mine are now pledged to Victory Lounge. This is where the Moodley family has been purveying bunnies since 1946. Not sure how to approach this sloppy undertaking, I dug into my bean bunny with a knife and fork.\n“No! Absolute shock, horror, that’s how people would react,” Ms. Platter said with a laugh when I recounted my faux pas to her later. “It’s quite architectural in a way. You go from the top, tear off and dip in, going round and round, gradually getting down to the bottom.”\nPardon my lack of bunny etiquette. It was a muggy 85-degree afternoon, and I must have forgotten my manners somewhere between my masala-omelet breakfast and the masala-steak sandwich I’d snacked on en route to Victory Lounge. And the bunny was just an amuse-bouche to the curry buffet that lay ahead for dinner. The perspiration pooling around the back of my neck was surely pungent with salt, coriander and a dash of red chile, and yet, I persevered.\nMy quest began, as these kinds of culinary follies do, with a craving. Ever since I moved from New York to South Africa, I’ve been amazed by the quality and diversity of food, the mouthwatering result of centuries of intermingling — albeit not always voluntary — of Dutch, English, Indians and Malaysians with indigenous populations. And yet something was always amiss in Cape Town’s Indian restaurants, something that I, as a first-generation Indian-American who is just as at home in Hyderabad as Boston, was particularly conscious of.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Indian food is my comfort food, my panacea for all manner of life’s daily indignities. Some might seek solace after a bad day in their mother’s chicken potpie; I request her khatti dal (lentils). There’s no cold day a steaming plate of kheema (minced beef) and rice can’t warm up, and no “Empire” marathon a takeout carton of butter chicken and garlic naan can’t enhance. I even named my pint-size red car Mirchi — chile. In New York, I made regular pilgrimages four blocks from my apartment to Curry Hill, a spice devotee’s Promised Land; but for all of Cape Town’s culinary merits, I’ve struggled to find a go-to joint. It was time to look eastward: to Durban, home to one of the world’s largest Indian communities.\nVictory Lounge is on Dr. Yusuf Dadoo Street, the heart of Durban’s Central Business District, once known as the Casbah. Today, the area simultaneously inhabits two worlds: It could be any city in Africa, or it could be any city in Gujarat. A colossal gilded dome presides over the Juma Masjid mosque, one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, and the sidewalks are crowded with vendors hawking fruits, phone covers and hair-braiding services. Justin Bieber tracks blaring from roadside boomboxes mingle with the adhan, or call to prayer.\nFrom Victory Lounge I walked to Victoria Street Market, where numerous spice shops supply the city’s curry houses with their red-hot flavor profiles. A cursory glance at the powdery pyramids made me wonder what havoc mothers-in-law must have wreaked in Durban to earn them such a noxious reputation — I spied “Mother-in-Law Hellfire” and “Mother-in-Law Exterminator” among the mounds of crimson and marigold.\nMy own (perfectly pleasant) in-laws served as my entree into this far-flung outpost of the Indian diaspora. Most Indian-American families I know began immigrating to the United States in the 1970s; my husband’s family sailed to Durban from Gujarat nearly a century before that. (Mahatma Gandhi arrived in 1893, and the seeds of his Satyagraha movement were planted in Durban.) Yet despite being so many generations removed, South African Indians have retained much more of the culture than I would have expected — case in point, the food.\n“We have apartheid to thank for that,” said Devi Sankaree Govender, an investigative television journalist who collaborated with Ms. Platter on “Durban Curry.” Ms. Govender is a fifth-generation South African Indian, whose ancestors came as indentured laborers on the first ship from India in 1860. “We only had each other. You didn’t interact with other people.”\nPhoto Bunny chow at the Britannia Hotel.

It remains predominantly Indian today, and every Saturday people from across Durban converge for the weekly Bangladesh Market. Colorful tents mushroom all over a parking lot, the air is thick with the scent of peppers and incense, and Hindu devotional bhajans lilt through the air as people bargain for eggplant, okra, soap, Bollywood DVDs and vats of achaar (a piquant condiment made of pickled fruits or vegetables). All the essentials for an Indian household.\nThe anti-apartheid activist Zuleikha Mayat is the doyenne of South African Indian cookery. As the head of Durban’s Women’s Cultural Group, she edited the “Indian Delights” cookbook that has taught generations of housewives how to make patta curry and prawn biryani (I received two copies as wedding gifts, including one she signed for me). “It’s very much like Indian food, but with a South African flavor,” she said. “It’s a fusion of Indian food with local products.”\nAs you might expect, after a hundred-year sabbatical from the subcontinent, Durban’s Indian food has developed its own distinct patois in the broader Indian culinary vernacular. A Delhiite’s dining experience in Durban might be akin to that of a traveler from Beijing trying General Tso’s chicken, or of someone from Guadalajara dabbling in Tex-Mex — it’s vaguely familiar to the palate, but something’s definitely changed. Even the pronunciations and spellings have evolved subtly over the decades: biryani became breyani; dal turned into dhall; samosas are now samoosas. Cooks have incorporated local ingredients like samp (pounded corn kernels) and amadumbe (taro), and been daring — sometimes too daring — with the heat. The same Indian spices are wielded here, but why does it sometimes feel as if they’re simply upturned without compunction into simmering pots?\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Compared with Indian curries, “it’s hotter and it’s oilier,” Ms. Platter confirmed. “If it doesn’t come with its own oil slick, it’s not a Durban curry.”\nIn the Workshop mall, Oriental Restaurant serves a vermilion chicken curry that tastes about as red as it looks. “If you’re not going to cook a genuine curry, why cook a curry at all?” asked Nelson Nundoo, the manager, with a smile when I ordered an extra water bottle.\nI sat under colorful signs reminiscent of India’s famous truck art while eating chaat and other street-food fare at the kitschy cafe attached to the Spice Emporium, a one-stop shop for everything from cookbooks to spices to tiffins (lunch containers) to home temples. Capsicum Restaurant at the Britannia Hotel is a past-its-heyday icon often lauded for the best bunny in town; I personally found their chicken kebab bunny a touch too fiery to make me trade in my Victory Lounge colors. The oceanfront Seabelle has a distinctly trapped-in-the-1970s air about it, with grungy tiled floors, Christmas lights, a soundtrack that veers from Sonny and Cher’s “I Got You Babe” to Silk’s “Freak Me” without notice, and, for some inexplicable reason, a larger-than-life pirate presiding over the dance floor. But what it lacks in ambience, it makes up for in flavor with its legendary prawn curry.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story And no Durban family worth its cumin would dare host a wedding that isn’t catered by Solly Manjra . If an invitation isn’t in the cards, you’re still in luck. Every week after Friday prayers, in a spotless dining hall above the catering operation, hundreds of patrons line up for a generous buffet Mr. Manjra prepares in deghs, massive caldrons balanced over open fires. “We come here once a month for the buffet,” said a diner, Tony Ferreira. “We come because it’s one of the best curry houses in town.”\nAt Mali’s Indian Restaurant, I tried a luminous, messy crab curry so intense my fingers burned for hours afterward. “Crab curry is a Durban institution,” my cousin-in-law Imraan Tayob said as I struggled to stanch my running nose. “We’ve developed our own niche of Indian food here; it’s definitely a hybrid type of cuisine,” he added. “Indian food in the U.S. is more authentic, as most of the families who own the restaurants are first generation. But here it’s adapted — it’s more bordering on fusion.”\nI encountered examples of this fusion everywhere I went. Durban’s pastel-tinted Art Deco beachfront has something of a low-budget Miami quality to it — except for the vendors selling fresh pineapple daubed in red chile. On the open-air patio of House of Curries on trendy Florida Road, I tried a chip chow, what I can only describe as Durban’s answer to poutine: French fries doused with beef curry and crowned with melted cheese. And at the hipster-heavy Morning Trade market, I debated between Scotch eggs swaddled in halal chicken tikka and goulash served in hollowed-out brioche buns, a riff on bunny chow. But this isn’t considered cultural appropriation in Durban, where the city’s culinary ethos is laced with Indian masala.\nPhoto Curry dish at the Oriental Restaurant in the Workshop mall. Credit Joao Silva/The New York Times Even during apartheid, Durban curries held the power to transcend race lines: “I think it’s a triumphant dish, a national treasure,” Ms. Platter said. “It belonged to all of us. I can’t ever remember not knowing about curry.” She also notes that there’s plenty of crossover with Zulu recipes, like chicken and amadumbe curry.\nAt the grande dame of Durban hotels, the refined colonial-style Oyster Box, a major draw is the popular curry buffet. I was duly warned that some consider it “wit ous’ curry,” or white guys’ curry, catering predominantly to the fragile palates of tourists. Perhaps I should check my own lineage for traces of European ancestry, because I found it delicious. A few days of tongue-torching fare must have rendered me desperate for the more subtle flavors showcased on the genteel patio overlooking the ocean. Afterward, we stopped by Sunrise Chip N Ranch to pick up its famous cheese rotis, wraps stuffed with cheese, fries and gravy. If you think that sounds like classic drunk food, you’re not alone: The only other patrons were a crew of surfer types in the midst of a night out, and I was assured that the lot is perennially packed after midnight.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story “No one could resist a curry,” Ms. Govender said. “I think that’s the reason it became so much a part and parcel of South African cuisine. It’s bold and in your face, and you’re happy and you’re going to come back for more.”\nI certainly came back for more — then more, and more, and still some more after that. Durban awakened my taste buds to how a familiar bouquet of spices can still invoke new tastes. But even a die-hard masala fanatic like myself has her limits: On my final night in the city, after 13 curry stops in five days, I treated myself to a nice, bland pasta.\nIF YOU GO Where to Eat Victory Lounge, 187 Dr. Yusuf Dadoo Street.\nVictoria Street Market, 151/155 Victoria Street (corner of Queen and Victoria Streets); indianmarket.co.za/jhi.\nBangladesh Market, Business Square, Chatsworth.\nPhoto Spices at the Victoria Street Market.
