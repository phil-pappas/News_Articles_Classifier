The city becomes a character in itself and you can’t help falling in love with it. There’s also something great about seeing your country represented like that. It makes you proud to be British. \nParts of the film were such fun to make, particularly the night scenes where whole parts of London were closed off… although I don’t think it was such fun for people living nearby. Filming by Big Ben, we got loads of complaints as there were helicopters coming and going, lights flashing and waking people up. \nBut when you see the film it’s incredible; it paints London in such a great light. The Mayor said that the Bond producers should re-light London permanently because they did such a great job. \n• Around the world with every James Bond film \nWe filmed at Tower Bridge, on the River Thames, by Big Ben, on the South Bank – and, for the Bond Sony commercial I did, on the Millennium Bridge. Probably the best part of it for me was meeting a real spy at MI6 and asking him questions about his job, because you would never normally get an opportunity to do that. I had to keep pinching myself. “You are at MI6, talking to a spy!” I kept telling myself. \nI’d find it hard to leave London. I’ve lived in the city all my life, and still stay in Finsbury Park, where I grew up. What’s magical about London is that it’s so multicultural, and like a collection of little villages. And it’s so cultured, too. It’s incredibly rich; you can get whatever you want. You go to Wimbledon and it’s like a country village. You go to Knightsbridge, and it’s completely different. You go to Finsbury Park and it’s so urban. \n• James Bond on skis: 007's greatest moments on the slopes \nIt’s also beautiful in different ways, depending on the seasons. I particularly love winter, when it snows. I know most people hate it as the whole city grinds to a standstill, and it messes everything up. But when this blanket of silence descends on London, it’s so magical. \nOf all the different areas of London, I suppose I know my home territory the best: the shops on Fonthill Road, where my mum would drag me every weekend; Stroud Green Road, with all the Jamaican shops, selling yams and jerk seasoning, which I love; and Pak Cosmetic Centre, the biggest black hairdresser in London, which people from all over the country visit just to buy their products. \n'The best part of it for me was meeting a real spy at MI6' \nThere are other pockets which feel like home, too: Hampstead Heath, where I go a lot. I live in a flat, and need an environment without noise and stress and too many people, where I can reconnect with nature, take my shoes off and feel the earth. Or there’s the Natural History Museum, where I went a lot as a child with my younger brother and sister (I wish I could do one of those sleepovers they do now). \n• James Bond film locations around Britain \nFor a day away from the city, the thing I enjoy most is going to a stately home in the countryside. There’s no nicer way of spending time than wandering around the grounds and having a picnic. \nThen again, it’s good to get home, too. The other actors in SPECTRE had to go to Morocco and Mexico and Austria to film while I got to stay at home. I was glad. To me, living in London is such a privilege. \n'I'd find it hard to leave London' Restaurants \nLa Poule au Pot ( pouleaupot.co.uk ), in Ebury Street, makes you feel as if you’re in France. It’s really small and quirky, the owners always look after you beautifully, and the food is extraordinary. Beach Blanket Babylon ( beachblanket.co.uk ) in Notting Hill has fab food, a lively atmosphere and great quirky décor. Orrery ( orrery-restaurant.co.uk ) on Marylebone High Street has impeccable service, superb food and a gorgeous sun terrace. It’s also got a hidden entrance so not many people even know it’s there. Food shop \nI’m a real foodie and so have to go into Planet Organic ( planetorganic.com ) to see what its latest obscure “must have” health ingredient of the moment is. Market \nThe Sunday market at Alexandra Palace ( alexandrapalace.com ) has a great variety of locally grown organic food, and it’s fun shopping in the middle of the glorious grounds. I should also mention Alfies Antiques Market ( alfiesantiques.com ) in NW8, given that I’ve kitted out my entire home from stalls there. Flowers \nWhenever I buy anyone a bunch of flowers from The Floral Design House ( floraldesignhouse.co.uk ) in N10, they always say how stunning the arrangement is and how long the flowers last. The florists are always accommodating and friendly, too. Parks \nI particularly enjoy Hampstead Heath.
