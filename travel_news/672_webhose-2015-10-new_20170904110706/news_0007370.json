We are looking forward to welcoming visitors to our static display and introducing them to another level of world-class hospitality.” \nThe airline will reveal the Gulfstream G650ER on the first day of the airshow (8 November). The G650ER, which is the first of 30 latest generation Gulfstream aircraft to be ordered by the private jet division of Qatar Airways, will fly further, faster than any business jet in the world, with the capability of flying non-stop from Doha, Qatar, to the USA. The aircraft has a two-cabin configuration, which seats up to 13 passengers – the seats convert into fully flat beds, so that seven guests can easily sleep on board. \nThe airline will also display its 25th Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which will fly to the airshow from the delivery ceremony in Seattle on 4 November. Qatar Airways’ Boeing 787 Dreamliner has a two-cabin configuration, comprised of 22 seats in Business Class and 232 Economy Class seats with a high standard of comfort on board, including individual 10.6 inch television screens for all Economy Class seats and a full complimentary food and beverage service. \nQatar Airways will showcase both the Airbus A350 XWB, for which it was the global launch customer, and an A380, two of the 166 in the fleet of highly-sophisticated, most technologically-advanced aircraft in the sky.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:01:17.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
