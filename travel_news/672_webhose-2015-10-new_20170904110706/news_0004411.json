The Coeur d'Alene Casino Resort Hotel is prohibited from serving alcohol for 10 days after holding \"HUNKS The Show,\" a traveling performance that includes stripping and dancing. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe, which operates the resort, also must pay a $25,000 fine. \"Dancers with the show 'Hunks' created the problem, not with nudity but apparently with dance moves the Idaho liquor control board considers excessive,\" casino spokesman Bob Bostwick told The Spokesman-Review. Bostwick said the dance group broke a state law that bans performers from simulating sex acts. The tribe in September agreed with the Idaho State Police Alcohol Beverage Control Division to the license suspension and fine. \"The dance group violated their contract, which stipulated that they would keep the show within the bounds under Idaho liquor laws,\" Bostwick said. \"Still, it is the seller who is penalized.\"Carl Disonell, booking agent and owner of the eight-man show, said the group does 250 performances a year around the country. He was surprised the January event in northern Idaho resulted in the casino's liquor license being suspended. \"It's a normal show,\" he said. \"What people don't understand is it's really up for interpretation. If a guy pops his hips one time — 'Oh, that's a sex act.'\"He said Idaho was the only place the show caused problems for a venue. \"It's like we're in the 1940s,\" he said. \"It sounds to me like (inspectors) went there looking to fine the casino.\"Idaho State Police spokeswoman Teresa Baker said there was no full nudity, but performers pushed the boundary too far and violated state law by showing too much buttocks. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:04:39.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
