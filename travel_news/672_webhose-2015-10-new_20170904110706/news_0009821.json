The venue safaris hosted over four nights were launched to showcase venue collections and Christmas offerings at a selection of their City and West End venues. \nAttendees were chauffeured between venues in a Late Night London red party bus. Event agency bookers from Awesome Events, Chew Events, Chilli Sauce were in attendance, with Barclays, KPMG, John Lewis, corporate bookers. The safaris were in collaboration with ABSOLUT, Malibu and the newly appointed Late Night London champagne partner Mumm. Guests visited a combination of Sway, Amber, Core, Mabel’s and the recently refurbished Tiger Tiger Haymarket where they enjoyed a range of champagne, cocktails, canapes, buffet style and bowl food from Late Night London’s new Christmas menu. Tiger Tiger served up Rockin’ Robin cocktails, a client favourite during the festive period. Invitees also enjoyed smoked salmon crostinis, brie and cranberry roulade, mini Yorkshire puddings with rare beef and sticky beef jus and slow roasted pork belly. Georgina Coleman, Head of Corporate Sales at Late Night London commented; \"The meeting and events team at Late Night London are really proactive with engaging our clients with our seasonal menu offerings, new sites and refurbished venues. It’s a priority to us to gain clients feedback so we can continue to improve and exceed expectations. Incorporating the party bus experience meant we were able to engage brand partners and remind everyone what Late Night London does, we create great experiences and events at some of the most diverse venues in London\". 2015 has seen Late Night London launch Mabel’s and Scarlet’s in the West End and refurbishes Minster Court and Bury Court in the City, whilst also having an extensive refurbishment on Tiger Tiger Haymarket.
