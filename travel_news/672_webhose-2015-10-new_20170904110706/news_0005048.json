This site, which identifies houses, villas, hostels, bed-and-breakfasts and hotels that offer stairs-free access to bedrooms, roll-in showers, grab rails and more, is a welcome addition to the travel space.\nWhat’s not: At first glance it looks as if it has only one small picture of a property’s exterior. Visual details of the showers, tubs and hallways, which travelers might want to look at before booking, were buried deep in a property’s “View” page. The site is still in beta testing, so give it a little time. I’m hoping navigation with subcategories (besides searching by country) will be next, as well as filters for certain types of properties, such as those best for travelers with hearing impairments. Note: You can filter “wheelchair access” on Airbnb, but it lacks Accomable’s other features.\n— Jen Leo, \nLos Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:53:06.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
