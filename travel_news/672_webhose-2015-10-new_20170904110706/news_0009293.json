Buy an autonomous underwater vehicle that surfaces to recharge its batteries with sunshine and sometimes wave power. See ships and planes circumnavigating the world electrically on sunshine alone. Buy an electric plane with a propeller that goes backwards when it rides thermals to charge the battery. Buy a boat that has a thrust propeller that does the same when under sail or moored in a tidestream.\nElectric energy independent vehicles (EIVs) are going to be of immense importance even in remote communities and the third world as they become much more capable. Energy independent airships, fixed wing planes and underwater vessels are being designed for surveillance and inspection.\nA multi-billion dollar industry is awaiting those involved in boats, ships, aircraft, land vehicles and energy harvesting. The electric vehicle business is forecasted by IDTechEx to be around $500 billion in 2026, rising strongly thereafter.\nIn this 164 page report, with 119 figures and tables, the electric vehicle market addressable by energy independence technology is forecasted in 45 categories. And EIVs, often the end game, will be an increasingly significant part of it. 33 energy independent vehicle projects by land, on-water, underwater and in the air are analysed after a thorough grounding in the technologies. How those technologies will progress is given particular attention - from multi-mode harvesting to structural electronics where the structure doubles as supercapacitor, battery and so on. Achievements and potential are presented in easily understood form. The basis is almost entirely research in 2015 from intensive global travel, interviews and analysis by PhD level experts. Latest conference material and presentations from across the world are shown.\nLand and water vehicles are pushing for higher speeds but the aircraft have got there and are now seeking other things, sometimes at slower speed. The other things include carrying more people and cargo and going further. The arrows show the trend in speed of next generation vs today's EIVs.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03273455-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
