Unfortunately, by this time other work to upgrade the signalling at the level crossing site had already taken place, meaning that the original level crossing cannot be reopened immediately for safety reasons.\nSteve Knight, area director for Network Rail, said: “We sincerely apologise to local residents for the disruption caused by the current closure of Plumpton level crossing. No level crossing is entirely safe or risk free, but we know we have to find a safer long term solution for the level crossing at Plumpton. We cannot stand idly by and allow an outdated, high-risk crossing to remain in use when we know we can make it much safer.”\n“We were wrong to assume that planning permission would be granted on 30 September and should not have started work on site until this consent had been given. The resignalling work we have done at the site of the level crossing means the road cannot be reopened immediately.”\n“We are currently conducting a risk assessment to identify what measures need to be put in place to safely reopen the crossing and the road as soon as possible, whilst we continue to work with the community and the district council to find a safe long term solution.”\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:29:18.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
