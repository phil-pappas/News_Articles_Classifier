I'd heard big things were happening Downtown.\nOnce the twinkly centre of the city, the district had earned unfair descriptions, its urban sprawl unpopular with those hunting out glitz and glamour. But as with any area down on its luck, what goes down, must come up.\nColourful spices and nuts at the Grand Central Market, which boasts a mix of hip eateries and traditional, reasonably-priced food stalls\nStriking: The magnificent Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall on Grand Street, where culture fans are spoiled for choice\nAnd if there is one symbol of LA's capacity for regeneration, it is Grand Central Market, where I begin my whirlwind visit. Downtown's throbbing heart whose own image changes chameleon-style with every rise and fall of the city's economic stature.\nBack in Downtown's golden age, when theatre neons lit up Broadway, the market was a grand place bursting with rare delicacies such as specialty eggs, and Sauerkraut: its clientèle rich, its stalls a reflection of the Zeitgeist.\n Fans flock to real life 'haunted' hotel which inspired new... White beaches, designer bed linen and daily massages: The... Child monks, stunning mountains and fearless tribesmen: The... Then, in the 1950s a mass exodus brought on by new infrastructure led to the middle classes leaving for leafier climes, and immigrants moved in, paying cheap rent and laying claim to its fertile commerce space. Stalls diversified, and began selling delicious Asian and Latin American foods.\nBut by the 1970s, the expansion east saw area's occupancy decrease to just 60 per cent and the market left was empty. Until it was bought in 1984, by Downtown visionary Ira Yellin, along with the Million Dollar Theatre and the landmark Bradbury building.\nThe Broad, a $140m new art museum, home of the largest private art collection in the world, recently opened on central Grand Avenue\nIn Downtown's golden era, bright neons lit up Broadway. Now many theatres remain, some converted into trendy shops or hotels\nIra and his wife Adele, who has run the joint since he died in 2003, brought the kind of life and vision to the market that can only come from dust and gloom and desperation.\nWhile the original stalls such as China Cafe and the legendary tacos at Ana Maria have remained stalwarts of the market's budget food scene, now adopting modern ethics and using organic produce, young urban marketeers are banging the doors down to get a pitch, with names such as Eggslut, where coddled eggs come in jam jars, and Sticky Rice, who pioneered new wave street food here gleaning more fans by the day.\nAdjacent to the market, the disused Angel's Flight railway, the world's shortest funicular railway points upwards to Grand Avenue, the next stop on my itinerary.\nBetween the city skyscrapers and Downtown mainstay Grand Central Market, you'll find the world's shortest funicular railway\nThe throbbing heart of Downtown: Grand Central Market, home to decently priced fruit and vegetable stalls as well as hip foodie haunts\nWith the opening of The Broad on September 20, a $140m museum featuring the world's largest privately-owned art collection, Grand Avenue looks to be an art and architecture lovers dream, with the incredible Frank Gehry designed Walt Disney Music hall – a triumph of ocean-inspired silver, subtle functionality and high whimsy and the museum of contemporary art Moca all within paces of each other.\nEli Broad is an 82-year-old former property mogul, who has spent a large part of his life devoting his time and money on reinvigorating Downtown.\nHis 2,000-strong art collection is free for all to enter. Everything from the honey-comb like outer shell of the building, designed by architectural firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro to provide filtered natural daylight to preserve the art inside, to the windowed vault, giving visitors a peek at the art work not currently on display, helps to cement LA's place as the contemporary art capital of the world.\nAt Eggslut, in Grand Central Market, the speciality is a coddled egg on top of a potato purée, poached in a jar and served with a baguette\nI stay at the Ace, a hotel so hip they go further than exposing the brickwork. In the lobby, insulation hangs off one of the walls, and believe it or not, it looks stylish. The walls are strewn with pencil doodles by two of LA's hippest twins, the Haas brothers, a pair of razor sharp designers, who have worked with Lady Gaga and famously scandalised Art Basel with sexualised furniture, and whose love for LA stems from its open-mindedness, a catalyst for creative minds.\nConstructed inside the historic United Artists building, one of Downtown's icons itself inspired by actress Mary Pickford's love of Gaudi's Segrada Familia, the hotel was built in 1927 as a film studio and there are nostalgic references abound. Dotted about the place are dusty records, a retro passport booth and vintage record players.\nRooms resemble the New York apartment you dream of living in - but never will - with hardboard paneling, industrial lights and even sheet music note paper for budding rock stars. I was more interested in the contents of the minibar, and accidentally spend $11 (around £8) on a 'Bearded Bros raw, vegan, gluten and soy free energy bar. Rock and roll.\nThe rooftop pool at the Ace Hotel, where rooms resemble the edgy New York apartment you dream of living in - but never will\nConstructed inside the historic United Artists building itself inspired by actress Mary Pickford's love of Gaudi's Segrada Familia\nOver in Hollywood, Silverlake has long been lauded as the 'Brooklyn of Los Angeles' its kooky vibe and boutiques piled high with vintage gear making it popular with those looking to escape Rodeo Drive and Beverly Hills.\nBut a new hip spot is emerging, somewhere cooler, more relaxed and without the the constraints of gentrification... yet.\nLos Feliz has a Portland-esque coolness to it. People have sleeve tattoos and flesh tunnels, shops sell vintage kook and cafes really care about their produce. But Los Feliz seem real, friendly and relaxed, too. And there are some really good bars.\nAlong Vermont avenue, the main drag: The Rockwell Table and Stage features VIP performances from none other than actor Jeff Goldblum when he's in town; and performances include Unauthorised parody musicals of Romi and Michelle's High School Reunion. While the Dresden, featured in the movie Swingers, also plays host to stars of the film Marty and Elayne, in its house band.\nSHOP LOS FELIZ: THE BEST SPOTS FOR FASHION, VINTAGE AND COLLECTIBLES\nLa La Ling - For the coolest tots, check out La La Ling, a contemporary boutique for babies, kids and their fashionable parents. There's even a chalkboard wall to keep the kids busy while you shop.\nUna Mae’s - Hand-crafted goods, organic products, great design, and items that encourage and foster creativity.

Starting at the Angel City Brewery, I walk along Traction Avenue, staring up and around at street art from graphic style to the whimsical work of Kim West.\nThis is food truck heaven, another emblem of hipster LA. At weekends, the car park of the brewery is rammed full of them and punters play board games, most probably sporting ironic handlebar mustaches. Like downtown, this area has changed over time, with artists piling up in cheap warehouses, eventually granted permission to make them home, colouring the streets with art wherever you look.\nHere, art welds with social media all over the streets and pavements. It's a great time for art in LA, it's easier to get noticed when exposure is unlimited. Adding to the strong cultural movement in LA, fuelled by the regeneration of Downtown, this is a world so far from the brash celebrity-focused image the city projects in films and popular culture.\nStreet art in Arts District includes everything from graphic-style pieces to the whimsical work of Kim West, pictured here\nIn little Tokyo, Cafe Dulce serves up unexpectedly delicious treats such as green tea donuts (but they won't do your waistline any favours)\nHIDDEN EATS: THE BEST PLACE TO GET AN INTERNATIONAL FLAVOUR IN LOS ANGELES KOREATOWN - Zion Market for hodo gwaja walnut cakes and goldfish sweet buns\nLITTLE ARMENIA - Sasoun Bakery for the cheese borek and Falafel Arax (falafel balls with hummus)\nTHAI TOWN - Silom Market for taro root dumplings\nLITTLE TOYKO - Cafe Dulce for green tea donuts\nLA is home to some of the world's most creative artists and the regeneration of Downtown steadily strengthening its cultural identity\nTRAVEL FACTS For more information about Los Angeles visit DiscoverLosangeles.com\nReturn flights from London to LA are from £454 per person.
