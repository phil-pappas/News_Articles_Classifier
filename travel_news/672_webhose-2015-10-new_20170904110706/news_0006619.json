But sometimes you aren’t aware of the impression you’re making, and you can turn clingy. Here are four ways to ensure you never overstay your welcome during a networking conversation.\n1. Watch the other person’s body language. Be on the alert for cues they want to wrap things up, such as glancing at their watch or checking the time on their smartphone; a dramatic shortening of their responses; a tightening of their body, like they’re ready to get on the move; and especially the positioning of their feet. If their feet are pointed away from you, it’s a strong sign they want to leave.\n2. Learn to time yourself. When you’re speaking, your sense of time can become distorted. Just as you’d practice for media interviews, work with a trusted friend and start timing yourself in mock networking conversations. Learn what it feels like to speak for 30 or 60 seconds at a time. In the early stages of a conversation, don’t go too far beyond this. Once you’re certain the conversation is going well, feel free to dive into deeper monologues.\n3. Give them more airtime. It’s harder for someone to become bored talking with you when they’re talking about themselves. Practice asking open-ended questions that draw out your conversational partner, as well as follow-ups that allow you to go deeper. \"How long have you lived in New York?\" is a decent question, but \"Why did you move to New York?\" is likely to yield a much more interesting answer, and new conversational directions.\n4. Make yourself interesting. There are a limited number of initial \"small talk\" questions in the world. Practice answers that encourage people to ask more questions. If someone asks you \"What’s new?\" a response like \"I’m just back from a trip to Costa Rica\" leads to a fun discussion of travel or vacation plans.\n(Adapted from \"How to Tell If Someone Wants to Stop Talking to You\" at HBR.org .)\nHarvard Business Review", "external_links": ["https://hbr.org/"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:00:37.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
