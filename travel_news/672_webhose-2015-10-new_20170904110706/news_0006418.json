Here's a quick checklist to help you easily find one that best suits your needs. \nFamily travel insurance is an absolute must if you're planning to go away on holiday with your spouse and children. A few pounds spent on a good policy could save you many thousands of pounds should the unthinkable happen – especially since they tend to happen when you least expect them to. \nThe task, however, is finding the right kind of travel insurance that will best work for you. With all the insurers out there offering so many different plans, you need to be better informed when comparing them and deciding which one is best. Here are a few key pointers to remember when comparing family travel insurance plans. \nStart by Creating an Itinerary \nTravelling on an impulse is well and good, but planning beforehand gives you the advantage of identifying what you are going to do on your trip. Casually relaxing on a beach in Menorca won’t require the same rigorous insurance coverage as, say, skiing in the more remote corners of the Alps. \nGet Quotes from Multiple Sources \nThe next thing you need to do is shop around for quotes from a number of insurers. Your itinerary will allow you to identify what, exactly, you need coverage for and this in turn will afford you the ability to pick out the most cost effective plan you can find—without compromising on the security you need the most. \nTake Note of the Excess \nIt is very important that you understand the excess limits of plan you get. A £5 plan might sound incredibly cheap until you realize that you have to pull £500 out of your own pocket before the insurer will step in to cover the rest. Some insurers allow you to waive the excess—for a fee, of course. \nCheck the Limits on Possession Coverage \nAnother important factor to note when comparing family travel insurance plans is how much coverage you’ll get for your personal baggage. You can opt for low-coverage plans if you're willing to leave your gadgets and designer clothes at home, but you will definitely want to get higher coverage if you take these pricy items with you. \nCheck for Sporting and Hazardous Activity Coverage \nTake the time to carefully go over the terms covering sporting and hazardous activities. Such coverage is necessary if you plan to undertake these risky activities, but the coverage can vary depending on the circumstances of injuries obtained. For example, one insurer may provide cheaper cover for skiing accidents, but not when skiing off-piste. It’s the little things like this that you need to watch out for as you review the contract. \nBuy as Early as Possible \nOne last thing to remember while shopping around for insurance is to start looking around as soon as you can. Not only will you then have the time to thoroughly compare the different plans, but securing a plan early could save you money compared to last-minute travel policies. The latter effect is magnified for family travel insurance, which tends to be more expensive since you’re covering both adults and children in a group. On another point, making sure you purchase your policy early will cover you against unforeseen cancellations of any aspect of your holiday.   \nPatrick Chong is the Managing Director of Insuremore.
