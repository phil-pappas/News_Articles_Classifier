Here are five ideas to consider. \n• Review your bucket list. Check a trip off your wish list while spending time with a grandchild. Are you eager to make it to Machu Picchu, but don’t have any pals willing to travel? Do you yearn to take on the rapids of the grandest canyon? You need not look beyond the ranks of your family (and their parents). It will make the accomplishment and the memory that much sweeter. \nContact: wildland.com ; oars.com \n• Share your story. What stokes your fire? A backwoods adventure? A stroll down a historical lane? A visit to the home of golf? Shopping until you drop? Share your passion and experiences with the next generation. Involve the kids in the planning and make sure they know how and why the plan has been generated. \nNeed help with details? Consider a travel agent. \nContact: virtuoso.com \n• Head to the beach. The sunrise and sunset. Lazy days digging your toes into the sand while building creative castles. A leisurely stroll, searching for shells. A beach vacation is a great way to blend the interests and abilities of every age group. Opt for a spacious vacation rental to keep the clan close but allow for varied schedules. \nContact: verobeach.com ; visitflorida.com \n• Consider a cruise. From the biggest ships to the adventure crafts, multigenerational clans find it appealing to get on board for a seafaring family adventure. Expect high-tech and age-appropriate activities for all the children, plus music, shows, spa time, dancing and dining choices for adults. On bigger ships, each family member can choose his or her own brand of fun for the day. \nContact: royalcaribbean.com ; uncruise.com \n• Saddle up on a ranch. Discuss your plan for each day over farm-fresh eggs, bacon and biscuits. Will it be a half-day ride into the backcountry or an afternoon of fly-fishing on a stream? A guest ranch getaway provides a picturesque setting where the generations can learn about horsemanship, paint by the fire or relax on the porch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:34:25.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
