The story of Antonio, Portia and Shylock also produced the most popular Chinese-language dramatisations in the early 20th century, when the curtain was raised on 20 or so plays. However, these were Shakespearean stories based on Charles Lamb’s children’s books. Often the actors were only given the plot, no dialogue. They were supposed to improvise. The emphasis on narrative had an unintended benefit, however, as it often brought out the contemporary relevance of the stories. The Usurper, a 1916 production based on Macbeth, was a not-so-subtle swipe at the president-turned-emperor Yuan Shikai. The lead actor was arrested on the grounds of inciting unrest and rebellion and was sentenced to death. Fortunately for him, Yuan died suddenly and his regime fell before he could be executed. The first professional Chinese production based on William Shakespeare’s own text, albeit in translation, took place in 1930. Again it was The Merchant of Venice. Painted backdrops depicted Italian scenes and the actors wore Western costumes. Radical reinterpretation: Chinese ballet dancers perform Romeo and Juliet in Nantong, Jiangsu province, in August 2013 Photo: HUANG ZHE / XINHUA According to the scholars Ruru Li and David Jiang, as of 1994 about 95 per cent of Shakespearean productions in China adhered to this style, which was considered authentic. The spoken play, as we know it, was an import from the West. Shakespeare’s appearance on the Chinese stage coincided with the introduction of this new art form. As this modern, Western form of theatre searched for maturity in urban China, traditional Chinese theatre, made up of hundreds of dialect-based operas, took to Shakespearean material almost without a glitch. The larger-than-life characters, the long monologues and the dramatic twists all found a perfect home in China’s existing theatrical traditions. As a matter of fact, Hamlet was turned into a Sichuan Opera piece long before the curtain was raised on the first “authentic” translated play. The Chinese reincarnations are often cited as testimony of the Bard’s penetration into a different culture. But the reality may be different. Very often, adapting Shakespeare (and other Western sources) is a means of attracting a younger audience. Taiwan actor Hsing-kuo Wu was blunt when he transformed Macbeth into The Kingdom of Desire, a Peking Opera. “By using a foreign play the company would have a somewhat neutral text on which it could write its own prescription for the future,” he said. \"I learnt to channel my own questions and interpretations into the play and find release and communication in the world of Shakespeare.” Pu Cunxin, Chinese stage actor In the past two decades an experimental approach has been used, a hybrid of the “authentic” style and total localisation. It is interesting to note that all such efforts have been in the realm of theatre, not opera. Tian Qinxin’s new Romeo and Juliet retained key passages from the original text but all the transitional scenes were rewritten in the Beijing dialect. This juxtaposition may have puzzled some members of the audience but if you treat the original text as lyrics to a song it begins to make sense. The setting seems to be a dreamscape that incorporates both Beijing and Verona. Of all the Chinese stage directors, Lin Zhaohua may be the most brilliantly subversive in staging Shakespeare. He does not change the text but he never stops searching for ways to bring out what he perceives to be new discoveries from the hoary classics. His production of Richard III, for example, toned down the royal atmosphere and played the intrigue and conspiracy like a game. His message: back-stabbing happens everywhere. Mr Lin’s Hamlet, periodically revived since its 1990 debut, is a psychological drama in which the protagonist must face his own weaknesses as well as the fickleness of fate. As Pu Cunxin, who has played most of the leading roles in Mr Lin’s productions of Shakespeare, realised: “There is no Danish prince and I don’t have to imitate movements foreign to me. It’s just me, the feeble, hopeless, self-torturing intellectual. I learnt to channel my own questions and interpretations into the play and find release and communication in the world of Shakespeare.” Last year, Mr Lin’s acclaimed Coriolanus — premiered in 2007 and with a short stint in Edinburgh — was revived as part of a strong line-up that the Chinese National Centre for the Performing Arts designed to celebrate the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth. This could be the busiest Shakespeare year, at least for a single venue, since the first Shakespeare Festival was held in April 1986 when 25 plays were staged in Beijing and Shanghai. But then, Shakespeare has never been out of vogue in China. In 1949 alone, the year the People’s Republic of China was founded, as many as 13 of the Bard’s plays were presented nationwide. • Find more fascinating articles at China Daily • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:45:17.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
