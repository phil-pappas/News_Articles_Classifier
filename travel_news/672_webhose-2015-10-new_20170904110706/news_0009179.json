Hurricane Patricia is ‘strongest ever’ storm as it heads for Mexico October 24, 2015 6:51am \nFast-moving Patricia has grown into an 'extremely dangerous' major hurricane off Mexico's Pacific coast. October 23rd 2015 Evacuation ... Tourists watch as waves hit the shore in Acapulco, Mexico. Picture: Claudio Vargas Network Writers and agencies AP Email a friend \nAUSTRALIANS have been warned to exercise a high degree of caution in Mexico as one of the strongest hurricanes recorded slams into popular tourist areas. \nHurricane Patricia, a Category 5 hurricane with sustained 322 km/h winds capable of lifting cars and destroying homes and creating 12 metre waves, is expected to maintain its intensity when it makes landfall in southwestern Mexico on Friday afternoon (10am Saturday AEDT). \nIt has the potential to cause death and destruction over a large swath of the nation, including favourite tourist spots for Australian travellers including Puerto Vallarta, Manzanillo and Acapulco. Taking no chances ... Tourists, who were evacuated from their hotel, arrive at the University of Puerto Vallarta used as a shelter. Source: Reuters \nAustralia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warned on its Smart Traveller website on Friday “excessive rainfall, violent winds, and storm surges may cause flash flooding and landslides, which may lead to transportation and communications problems”. \n“You should monitor local news and weather reports, follow the advice of local authorities, and contact your travel agent or tour operator to determine whether the situation will disrupt travel arrangements,” DFAT warned. \n“The level of the advice has not changed. \n“We continue to advise Australians to exercise a high degree of caution in Mexico.” \nEmergency and medical care, as well as water and food supplies, could be affected.

Source: Reuters \nPatricia headed toward southwestern Mexico overnight as a monster Category 5 storm, the strongest ever in the Western Hemisphere that forecasters said could make a “potentially catastrophic landfall” later in the day. \nResidents of a stretch of Mexico’s Pacific Coast dotted with resorts and fishing villages on Thursday had already boarded up homes and bought supplies ahead of Patricia’s arrival. Some evacuations were reported in Puerto Vallarta. \nWith maximum sustained winds near 325km/h Patricia is the strongest storm ever recorded in the eastern Pacific or in the Atlantic, said Dave Roberts, a hurricane specialist at the US National Hurricane Centre. \nPatricia’s power was comparable to that of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7300 dead or missing in the Philippines two years ago, according to the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation.

There were more than 650,000 in Colima state, and more than 161,000 in Manzanillo. \nEvacuations were under way in Puerto Vallarta overnight, with officials taking people to 14 shelters, mostly in schools, according to the Jalisco government’s web page. Exact numbers of those evacuated were not immediately available. \nRoberto Ramirez, the director of Mexico’s National Water Commission, which includes the nation’s meteorological service, said that Hurricane Patricia will be powerful enough to lift up cars, destroy homes that are not sturdily built with cement and steel and will be able to drag along people caught outside when the storm strikes.

Source: AP \nMr Ramirez said that the people in the most danger from the hurricane will be those on the coast, especially in the state of Jalisco. \nThe lobby of the Shearaton Hotel in Puerto Vallarta was bustling overnight, with a long line of people forming to check out. More than 900 guests had rooms at the hotel the previous evening, but many wanted to get out of town before the storm arrived. \nSandra Rojas and her husband, a veterinarian from San Jose, Costa Rica, were among those trying to leave. After loading their cars, they were going to drive to the Jalisco state capital of Guadalajara to plan their next move. \nThe hotel is saying that nothing is going to happen,” said Ms Rojas. “But it’s nature. Anything can happen. Bunkering down ... people wait in line after arriving at a makeshift shelter in the Pacific resort city of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Source: AP \nIn Puerto Vallarta on Thursday, restaurants and stores taped or boarded-up windows, and residents raced to stores for last-minute purchases ahead of the storm. \nThe Hurricane Centre in Miami warned that preparations should be rushed to completion, saying the storm could cause coastal flooding, destructive waves and flash floods. \n“This is an extremely dangerous, potentially catastrophic hurricane,” centre meteorologist Dennis Feltgen said. \nMr Feltgen said Patricia also poses problems for Texas. Forecast models indicate that after the storm breaks up over land, remnants of its tropical moisture will likely combine with and contribute to heavy rainfall that is already soaking Texas independently of the hurricane, he said. \n“It’s only going to make a bad situation worse,” he said.

Residents evacuate ... a shelter at the University of Puerto Vallarta. Source: Reuters \nA hurricane warning was in effect for the Mexican coast from San Blas to Punta San Telmo, a stretch that includes Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta. A broader area was under hurricane watch, tropical storm warning or tropical storm watch. \nThe Hurricane Centre said Patricia was expected to bring rainfall of 6 to 12 inches (15-30cms), with isolated amounts of up to 20 inches (50 cms) in some locations. \n“We are calm,” said Gabriel Lopez, a worker at Las Hadas Hotel in Manzanillo. “We don’t know what direction (the storm) will take, but apparently it’s headed this way. ... If there is an emergency we will take care of the people. There are rooms that are not exposed to wind or glass.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:53:53.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
