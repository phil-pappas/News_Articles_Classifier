In conjunction with the highly anticipated hotel opening, renowned American photographer Gray Malin has unveiled his newest series, “Bhutan, Land of Happiness,” which will contribute to Le Méridien brand’s Follow Me partnership – a multi-faceted global art collaboration with that brings compelling video art installations and still photography into Le Meìridien hotels around the world.\n“As a country that measures its success by the Gross Domestic Happiness of its people, Bhutan truly is a one-of-a-kind destination waiting to be discovered, and with two stunning Le Méridien hotels in Paro and Thimphu, we are delighted to help adventure seekers unlock the country’s mythical allure,” said Brian Povinelli, Global Brand Leader, Le Méridien Hotel & Resorts. “Our latest collaboration with Gray Malin offers a unique lens to the destination and invites our creative and curious-minded guests into his world with a modern twist on Bhutan.”\nLe Méridien Paro, Riverfront is situated on the edge of the Paro River, offering panoramic views of the Eastern Himalayas. The intimate hotel features 59 contemporary guestrooms and suites, all designed with a classic Bhutanese point of view. With an idyllic swimming pool, state-of-the-art fitness center and signature Explore Spa, the hotel is poised to become the creative hub in the destination. Located ten minutes from Paro International Airport, the only airport in Bhutan, Paro is home to several sacred fortresses and hidden monasteries, including Bhutan’s iconic Paro Taktsang (Tiger’s Nest) as well as Ta Dzong, the National Museum and the hotel’s Unlock Art™ partner, allowing guests of Le Méridien Paro complimentary access.\nLocated in Bhutan’s capital city, Le Méridien Thimphu is a thirty minute drive from the breathtaking sights of Paro. With 78 thoughtfully-designed guestrooms and suites, the hotel is the largest in the country. For rich culinary experiences, the hotel provides three distinctive dining options, including an all-day dining restaurant that creates an evocative mix of local and international cuisine; a Pan-Asian restaurant that highlights authentic flavors from South-East Asia; and a casual café by day that transforms into a vibrant bar in the evening. Through Le Méridien brand’s Unlock Art™ programme, guests also receive complimentary and exclusive access to The Voluntary Arts Studio to explore and discover local art.\nBoth hotels are captured creatively in Malin’s latest photo series, “Bhutan, Land of Happiness”, which juxtaposes the iconic landscape and traditional architecture of Bhutan with his modern interpretation of joy and happiness. For instance, vibrant, bright-colored balloons pour from the doors of Le Méridien Paro while colorful tassels, reminiscent of prayer flags that line the countryside, frame exterior of Le Méridien Thimphu.\n“From the rice paddy fields to the riverside, shooting the series, which will be included in the second installation of the Follow Me partnership with Le Méridien, was truly a moving experience,” said Malin. “Bhutanese people and their breathtaking landscape both evoke an overwhelming sense of happiness that served as my inspiration for the collection.”\nThe Le Meìridien brand’s Follow Me partnership launched earlier this year, bringing video and still photography shot by Gray Malin on all seven continents into signature Le Meìridien Hubs,™ the brand’s re-interpreted traditional lobby spaces. Malin hopes his vast breadth of work will inspire guests and encourage them to see with new eyes during their travels. The collection will also be featured on the brand’s collectible hotel key cards.\nThis collaboration celebrates Le Méridien as the first global hotel brand to bring its guests an immersive experience of this scale, capturing the excitement of world travel through photography.
