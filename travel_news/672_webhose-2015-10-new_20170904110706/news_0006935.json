The Audi A3 and Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen are the only TDI models seeing increases in activity, at 1.6 and 3 percent respectively, which is consistent with segment-level traffic on KBB.com. Audi A3 shoppers are increasingly cross-shopping competing luxury models following the announcement. The most highly cross-shopped vehicles are the Lexus NX, BMW 2-Series and Mercedes-Benz CLA. ** * Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com Site Traffic, Comparing September Pre- (Weeks of August 31-September 13 ) and Post- (Weeks of September 14-October 18 ) Announcement Data. Please note: Data is compiled weekly (Monday-Sunday).\n** Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com Cross-Shopping Data for Week of October 12-18, 2015\n\"During the past four weeks following the emissions announcement, traffic to KBB.com has generally decreased after an initial surge in interest for Volkswagen diesel models, likely because of the stop-sell and negative press,\" said Arthur Henry , senior manager of Strategic Insights for Kelley Blue Book. \"Interestingly, with regard to cross-shopping data, consumers are not looking at fuel-efficient or hybrid vehicles. For example, shoppers interested in the Jetta TDI are looking to the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and Ford Fusion as alternatives, according to cross-shopping data from KBB.com.\"\nTo discuss this topic, or any other automotive-related information, with a Kelley Blue Book analyst on-camera via the company's on-site studio, please contact a member of the Public Relations team to book an interview.\nFor more information and news from Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com, visit www.kbb.com/media/ , follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/kelleybluebook (or @kelleybluebook), like our page on Facebook at www.facebook.com/kbb , and get updates on Google+ at https://plus.google.com/+kbb .\nAbout Kelley Blue Book ( www.kbb.com )\nFounded in 1926, Kelley Blue Book, The Trusted Resource® , is the only vehicle valuation and information source trusted and relied upon by both consumers and the automotive industry.
