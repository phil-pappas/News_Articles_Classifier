The AVL-equipped test site will be focused on measuring emissions from the cleanest light- and medium-duty vehicles that comply with the new Tier 3 regulation.\nAVL was awarded the contract based on its ability to meet the EPA's requirement for equipment capable of testing not only conventional vehicles but also hybrid and pure electric vehicles. The EPA plans to use the newly equipped test site to measure a vehicle's emissions' \"cleanliness\" against all fuel types. \"As recent events have shown, accurate emissions testing is becoming an increasingly critical component in the pact that automakers make with their customers,\" said Don Manvel , AVL North America Chairman and CEO, \"and we are honored that the EPA has entrusted us with helping them in this important initiative.\"\nAVL will have total system responsibility for all phases of the project, including design, installation, and commissioning of the emissions test equipment as well as training of EPA staff. AVL will be supplying its iGENERATION Series II emission measurement hardware and software, including the analytical bench, AMAi60, constant volume sampler, CVSi60, and particulate measurement system PSSi60. For test sequencing and reporting AVL will be supplying its iGEM Vehicle software operation on the AVL PUMA Open data acquisition and control system. The system will allow the EPA to measure super ultra-low concentrations of Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide, Total Hydrocarbons, Methane, Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) and particulate matter (PM).\nCompletion of the test site is expected by February, 2017.\nAbout AVL\nFounded in 1948, AVL is the world's largest independent company for development, simulation and testing technology of powertrains (hybrid, combustion engines, transmission, electric drive, batteries and software) for passenger cars, trucks and large engines. AVL's North American Headquarters are located in the Detroit suburb of Plymouth, Michigan .
