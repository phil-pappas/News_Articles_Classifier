Photo credit, Timberland \nThis stylish pair of lightweight glasses came as a surprise to me. I had no idea that Timberland also did sunglasses well, and they certainly do (they’ve actually been making eyewear since the 1970s, who knew?). I love the variety of colors and patterns that the polarized Wayfarer sunglasses come in (mine is a tortoise color). Another bonus is that they are made from plastic rather than entirely of metal so they are extremely lightweight and do not feel heavy on your face or when you wear them on your head or collar. \nThe lenses are neither entirely round nor rectangular instead having a hybrid look that works well on a variety of face types. I didn’t like that the Timberland logo is emblazoned on the lens itself, but it is so far to the top corner that it is hardly noticeable by someone and invisible to the person wearing the glasses. The logo is also placed on the ends of each of the arms, but they are typically hidden behind your ears. \nThe glasses come with polarized lenses, which can be matched in their own colors. I didn’t feel like the glasses dimmed the view too much, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to sunglasses. In fact, I often opt to forego sunglasses occasionally on hot days because they make me sweat and make things seem too dark. \nThe rims of the glasses essentially flat and do not wrap around the forehead much so some light can seep in, but it is hardly enough to be bothersome. These stylish Timberland glasses are perfect for recreational or professional wear (I have been using them to business meetings in a suit as well as on weekends). They retail for around $100 on the Timberland website or Amazon .
