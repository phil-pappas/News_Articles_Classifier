Given the long weekend, this was not unexpected. Nandi Hills is a favourite destination for many Bengalureans who want a quick holiday, but it lacks the needed infrastructure.\nNow comes a ray of hope, with the tourism department stepping forward to give a facelift to the popular destination. The department is planning to acquire 2 acres of land from the revenue department for parking of buses from the parking points to the top of the hill. The department is also making the DPR for the cable car that was announced in the budget.\nSpeaking on the plans in the pipeline, the tourism minister R V Despande said, “Although Bengaluru sees a lot of tourists every year, the city is not yet considered a major tourism hub. We are striving for that. And considering Nandi Hills is one of the prime tourist destinations of the city, we are planning a lot of activities there. Our team is currently working on the Detailed Project Report to have the cable car proposed in the last budget. The idea is to give people a better and more interesting experience.”\nHe adds, “We are in talks with the Revenue Department to get 2 acres of land for parking. Then we are planning to bring in special buses from the tourism department to take people from the parking point to the hill. However, all this will take some time to materialize.”\nAlthough many have welcomed the initiatives, a lot of visitors say before doing all this, the department should develop the road, which is in an appalling condition. Hundreds of people visit Nandi Hills every day to watch the mesmerizing sunrise, but the authorities have not been serious about its maintenance.\nPrestin Abraham, a visitor, points out, “They charge for entry. For my vehicle they took Rs 100. If they get Rs 100 from each vehicle, they must accumulate a lot of money. Then where is the money going? Why is the place not being maintained properly?” Yes, there are a lot of unanswered questions…\nStates: Karnataka South travel Nandi hills karnataka Karnataka Tourism Department Also Read Civic body for corporate aid to run Amma canteens Kozhikode pet stores beckon with exotic piranhas Manipal University discovers four exotic atomic nuclei Karnataka: B1, M1, K1, let’s have PeopleOne too Mr CM", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150930/lifestyle-travel/article/nandi-hills-lacking-basic-infrastructure-needs-revamp", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/NANDIHILLS%20%282%29_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/NANDIHILLS%20%282%29_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:19:14.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
