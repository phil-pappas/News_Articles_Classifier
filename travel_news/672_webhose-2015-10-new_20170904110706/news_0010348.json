Handout photo / Royalton Riviera Cancún Resort and Spa You can wander for hours in the ruins at Chichen Itza, west of the Mexican resort town of Cancún. Exploring caves - and swimming in them - should be on the to-do list of any exploring types visiting Cancún, Mexico. The caves at RioSecreto are great for all ages, with glacial-like water - but warmer. The hydrotherapy circuit at the Royalton Riviera Cancú \nRock-star luxury isn’t as expensive as you might think. Whether you book a family celebration, wedding, quality time with the kids, or vow to shake up your love life, here is the ultimate A-to-Z guide for your tropical reconnect at the newly opened Royalton Riviera Cancún Resort and Spa on Mexico’s Mayan Riviera . \nA waken your senses with tropical air that’s dense with floral scents, the sound of the relentlessly rhythmic surf, and the ultimate tease – that azure ocean. \nB each: Renowned for more than 23 kilometres of beaches with sand as fine as icing sugar, Cancún beach life is the antidote to every single stress in your life. \nC aves: Swimming in an underground river is otherworldly sublime. You snake your way through the calcified structures in glacial-like green water. At RioSecreto, the tour takes a few hours by the time you get to the site, suit up and explore – which seems too short by the time you finish. \nD iamond Club: This upgrade at the Royalton Riviera Cancún means personalized butler service, preferential dining reservations, an exclusive beach area, and some suites with rooftop Jacuzzis. You’ll get in touch with your inner celebrity. \nE quinox: If you time your visit during the spring equinox at Chichen Itza, you can watch at the Castillo de Kukulcan pyramid as sunlight reveals seven isosceles triangles that form. Then, observe the resulting shadow that looks like a giant snake creeping toward the huge serpent’s head at the base of the stairway. \nF amily: A burgeoning trend is to block several rooms and bring the extended family for celebrations and bonding, tropical style. Something about the sun and surf makes everyone get along: You’ll be cruising this resort with your happy entourage. \nG ourmet Marche: Like everything at the Royalton Riviera Cancún, the cuisine is top notch. It’s a buffet with local and international fare, and a special kids’ section. Marche is a culinary playground you’ll want to visit every day – if only to have dessert for breakfast. \nH ideaway is the intimate adults-only section within Royalton Riviera Cancún. It’s like a boutique hotel within a resort with its own pool, restaurant and exclusive bar. Guests also have the option for full access to all resort services, restaurants, a spa and bars. \nI sla Mujeres: Word is this is a lovely day trip to an island that retains old-world Caribbean charm. Or book a few days for diving or fishing. There are ferries that run from Puerto Juarez, just north of Cancún. The name translates to Island of Women. Gotta love that. \nJ ump in: There are eight pools at the Royalton Riviera. Depending on your package – such as Diamond Club or Hideaway – there’s always a pool to jump into. Good luck with getting bored. \nK ids Club: The younger set receives special attention with their own activities from games and a splash pad, to video games, billiards and table tennis in a dedicated Teens Club. \nL ocation: Just 15 minutes from the Cancún airport, the Royalton Riviera is on a secluded stretch of beach, about 45 minutes from Playa del Carmen, and about 30 minutes from Cancún. \nM ystery: Before Europeans learned to calculate cycles of the moon over thousands of years, the Mayans already had it mastered. Invariably, talk turns to what wiped out this civilization. The common assumption is it must have been a combination of drought, civil war, invasion and even an epidemic. \nN uptials: Peak season for destination weddings is April though June, when the Royalton Riviera Cancún averages two weddings per day. Whether on the beach, at a gazebo or with a bird’s-eye view atop the resort, nothing beats a golden tan paired with a white wedding dress. \nO pa Restaurant: This restaurant oozes opulence in its Mediterranean setting with Greek-inspired cuisine. Consider yourself warned: Save room for dessert. For our group, the chef created a large chocolate egg that, once broken, contained more chocolate pieces inside, and was displayed on a marble slab with cheesecakes, tarts, fruit, bitesized cakes, and streaked with sauces. \nP rice: A week’s stay at the Royalton Riviera Cancún Resort and Spa starts at $1,295 – plus $392 in taxes – per person based on two people sharing a luxury junior suite, for February’s peak season. Go to sunwing.ca for full details. \nQ uintana Roo: This is the Mexican state where Cancún is located. You will save yourself the cultural embarrassment if you pronounce the second word as Ro, not R . \nR echarge: You won’t want to leave the Royalton’s spa, especially the hydrotherapy circuit. There are powerful shower heads that blast the tension from your neck and shoulders and submerged lounge chairs that use pulsing water to massage. \nS unwing: This sun specialist flies to Cancún from 20 different Canadian and U.S. gateways with its signature Champagne service. A morning flight typically gets you onto the beach before cocktail hour. Full info and schedules are online. \nT ulum: The only Mayan settlement constructed on the shores of the Caribbean, this site is exquisite. One of the later Mayan discoveries – it remains a work in progress – Tulum’s walled village was the quintessential blueprint for community. \nU nderwater: If you want adventure, check out Nexus Tours in the hotel lobby and they’ll set you up in activities to keep you wet – from cave exploration to snorkelling and diving. Other options include deepsea fishing, wildlife tours and ATVing. \nV erigated: The sunsets are flaming orange close to the horizon, and gradually fade to paler hues the higher you look. Same with the ocean – from deep cobalt at the horizon to just a hint of blue once you look closer to shore. It’s colour that will inspire you to paint, take numerous photos, or just sit and stare for hours. \nW hale sharks at Contoy Island: Those lucky enough to swim with these docile behemoths rave about the adventure. Although scheduled to swim with these fishes, our group had to cancel due to stormy weather. \nX caret: Just south of Playa del Carmen, this eco-park is built around a lagoon. There’s an aviary and a zoo, turtle and dolphin pools, and an underground snorkelling river. \nY es: Say yes to the decadence of fine dining at the Royalton’s nine restaurants. If you’ve ever been to a mediocre all-inclusive resort, you can never go back after a stay at the Royalton. \nZ en Restaurant: Japanese simplicity is on display with fresh sushi and typical Teppanyaki meal preparation. Brings the kids for a lesson in how to prepare fresh food, and then gently work in an observation how perseverance pays off: One chef explained it took him about a year to master his knife-wielding skills for these entertaining displays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:04:08.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
