Some of our favorites include $49 flights from Southern California to San Francisco , $99 flights from New York to Florida and a $186 flight from Boston to Denver . \nWe can't help but think this may be JetBlue's effort to keep up with Southwest Airlines' epic fare sale from last week. The JetBlue sale, however, covers a longer travel period: Flights are from Nov. 4 through Feb. 10, with blackout dates including Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's. You must book by midnight tomorrow, Oct. 21. \nThe sale excludes Friday and Sunday travel , but no matter.
