I have. And there’s something off-putting about mixing eggs with artillery.\nI’m on the edge of the serene Lake Elmenteita, and at this present moment the area is home to about five lions. Hence the guard. Leo is less in the mood for sunny-side up and a lot keener on the bacon sizzling in the pan. Or, you know, us.\nThe area is currently home to about five lions. Source: Supplied\nThe lake sits on the Soysambu Conservancy and I’ve set up stumps at Lake Elmenteita Serena Lodge. It smacks of Brit imperialism, thanks to the original owner Lord Delamere — one of Kenya’s early settlers — and boasts luxe waterfront canvas ‘tents’, complete with four-poster beds and mid-century writing desks.\nI set down my bags and fall onto the day bed. It faces double-doors that open onto a veranda. Before I know it, I’m pulled from my daze by what sounds like a herd of elephants playing hopscotch on my roof. Heading outside, I spot, instead of elephants, a family of vervet monkeys playing tag. They see me, freeze and stare me down as I creep back into my room. Next thing I know, they’re at my door. Watching me watching them.\nVervet monkeys can be cheeky. Very cheeky. Source: Supplied\nLater, I ask our Southern Cross Safaris guide, Kevin, about the monkeys. “They’re bad news,” he says. Awesome. Turns out they habitually terrorise female guests. And I thought man-eaters were the ones to fear.\nPerhaps it’s time to flee the monkeys for something a little tamer — a jaunt around Lake Nakuru Park, perchance?\nThe 210sq km park is home to a lake that a flamboyance of flamingoes call home. Cruising around, Kevin alerts us to seven white rhinos — there are only 100 of the endangered species left in this area. As if they hear us, two become quite amorous and start mating. In front of us!\nLake Elmenteita is home to approximately 100 endangered white rhinos. Source: News Corp Australia\nTwo black rhinos meander alongside our vehicle. If you thought spotting a white rhino was celebratory, a black one is better — there are only 37 left. No lions were spotted, but rhinos getting lucky? That’s what Daft Punk was up all night for.\nPackages from $3525 per person, based on twin share, including accommodation, meals, transport, driver/guide and park fees.
