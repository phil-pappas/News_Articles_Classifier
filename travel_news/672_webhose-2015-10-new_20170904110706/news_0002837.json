The Sky Airline flight from Santiago, the Chilean capital, to Copiapo, was forced to make an emergency landing after panels from the left engine were torn loose as it sped along the runway, moments before it took to the sky. Passengers were put on an alternative flight to allow the plane to undergo repairs. View from inside the plane (Facebook / teletrece) The footage will no doubt scare nervous fliers witless, and Patrick Smith, a pilot and author of Cockpit Confidential, a mythbusting book on air travel, outlined the risks involved. “A portion of the engine cowling became unlatched - because perhaps it was not latched properly to begin with, got caught in the windstream and was torn off,” he told the Mail. “The cowling section itself is nothing immediately critical; it's just a cover. You can compare it, maybe, to the bonnet that covers the engine in your car. Damage to the engine wasn't the problem. The danger was in the piece striking some other portion of the airframe as it sheared away - namely the wings, the tail, or the aft stabilizers. An impact with the stabilizers, for example, could have been extremely hazardous. However, the slipstream lifted the piece well clear of these areas. From that point there was little or no danger.” Sky Airline was founded in 2001 and is now Chile’s second-largest carrier, operating under a semi-low cost model to 20 destinations in South America. It isn’t the first time an air passenger has captured terrifying footage on their mobile phone. One of those on board a Transaero flight from Barcelona in September last year filmed flames shooting out of one of the aircraft’s engines. A month later an American Airlines flight to Dallas made an emergency landing after cracks appeared in the cabin panels. • The 27 worst things about flying • Scary in-lfight announcements you don't want to hear • Pilots reveal their scariest near-misses • How to conquer a fear of flying Telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:10:27.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
