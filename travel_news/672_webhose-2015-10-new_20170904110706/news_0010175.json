Grubb, \"remember that they won't be here forever.\" Grubb knows: Her father, a pilot, died unexpectedly in 2005, which served as a painful reminder of all the trips they had planned but did not take together as a family. Since then she and her mother have taken many trips. Traveling together as adults is a far different experience from family vacations of one's childhood, Grubb maintains. Granted, going on a trip with an aging parent can be complicated. Your parents' needs and physical condition will determine where you go and what you do. But, says Grubb, the rewards far outweigh the challenges.\nGrubb and her mother have been traveling together for more than 20 years now. Some things have changed over time, she admits. \"I've found that as she's aged, she's become less tolerant of cultural differences.\" Physical issues also can play a role so that sometimes the child must become the caregiver and problem solver. It's a tricky balancing act, Grubb confesses. She's learned to compromise (\"Her input matters.\")\nGrubb offers helpful advice and plenty of anecdotes. She discusses medical considerations and choosing destinations that work for everyone. She reminds travelers to check your \"emotional baggage\" while on the road (\"try to shift the focus from the negative to the positive\"), plan some activities that you can each do separately, and perhaps, most importantly, pause before you speak (\"This simple technique does wonders to silence the nasty comments before they escape from your mouth.\").\nShe also addresses specific issues such as traveling with a wheelchair-bound parent or a parent with a portable oxygen device. Staying safe before, during and after the trip is a major concern too, which can range from choosing the right tour operator to researching for the best travel insurance to managing your cash. She includes a chapter on traveling with children and aging parents. A 2011 study found that 40 percent, or more than 20 million individuals or households in the U.S., had gone on a trip that included three or more generations â€” increasingly baby boomers take trips with their parents, children and even their grandchildren. \"During our multigenerational trips,\" writes Grubb, \"my family builds in a lot of rest time between activities so we can catch our breath.\"\nThe book concludes with a useful resource section, some sample packing lists and a few sample itineraries, from long trips overseas to short car trips. It's a terrific resource for any child and parent planning to take a trip together.\n\"The Big Trip: Your Ultimate Guide to Gap Years and Overseas Adventures\"\nLonely Planet, $21.99\nThere are many ways to describe it: a gap year, an overseas experience (OE), an exchange program, a working holiday, a sabbatical. But whatever you call it, more and more people are taking a few months or even a year off to see the world.\nThe gap year Lonely Planet \"The Big Trip: Your Ultimate Guide to Gap Years and Overseas Adventures.\" \"The Big Trip: Your Ultimate Guide to Gap Years and Overseas Adventures.\" (Lonely Planet) The book is divided into various parts, such as travel smarts, how to tailor your trip and how to decide where to go. There are useful tips on budgeting, staying safe on the road, staying in touch, respecting local cultures and, ironically, the culture shock of returning home. The chapter on jobs covers such essentials as sorting out visas, taxes and other bureaucratic red tape. Types of work also are discussed, from internships to temping to finding work on a cruise ship. That perennial favorite, teaching English, is here too. Why teach English? The editors provide 10 great reasons. You can, for example, go almost anyplace where they don't speak English.\nThe where-to-go section offers sample itineraries: from Europe to Africa and all points in between. The book concludes with individual traveler tales. Each traveler provides name, age, favorite country and then describes his or her big trip followed by a \"top tip.\"\nJune Sawyers is a freelance reporter.\n Travel", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5600bac1/turbine/ct-cth-books2395-jpg-20150921", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5600bac0/turbine/sc-books-travel-0929-20150921"], "published": "2015-09-22T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:04:02.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
