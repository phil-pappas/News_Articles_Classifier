But Lauren Singer, the blogger behind Trash Is for Tossers , has taken eco one giant step further. She lives zero waste, meaning she recycles and composts but does not produce any garbage that gets sent to a landfill. “At first no one noticed,” says Singer of her initial transition to a cleaner lifestyle. “Friends would come over and realize I had no product packaging in my house, and that’s when the questions started.” And now she shares helpful tips in the form of product recommendations, videos, and recipes on her site. Singer, who lives in New York City, is adamant that anyone can live a life less cluttered by trash, even if he or she isn’t ready to go fully zero-waste. “A lot of people care about the environment, and everyone can reduce their waste impact in a way that’s convenient to them.”\nIn that spirit, we’ve rounded up 16 household items that are delightful and earth friendly. Sure, brightly embroidered reusable linen napkins might not save the world, but they will help you take those first baby steps toward contributing to a healthier planet. Bonus: Everything will fit right in among your prettiest plates and handsomest homewares. Except the Tesla—keep that one in your garage!\nVogue may earn compensation on these sales through affiliate programs.", "external_links": ["http://www.trashisfortossers.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:16:19.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
