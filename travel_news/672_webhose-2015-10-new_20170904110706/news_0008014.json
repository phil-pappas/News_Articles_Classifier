Adding the company's technologies for indoor, outdoor, metro- and geo-area maps to its portfolio better positions Simpleview to help DMOs deliver relevant, unique solutions for meetings, group tour and their tourism partners. \nAt the core of the acquisition is software that allows Simpleview and destination marketing organizations (DMOs) to collaborate on custom maps for any need, from rich-media convention center info to wide-area tours of historic sites. Examples include: \n• Washington DC points of interest \n• Surfing map, Barbados \n• Puerto Rico convention center map \nFocus on Customer Experience \nHaving acquired close to 30 clients in the transaction, many of which already work with Simpleview, the company is exploring the automation of CRM feeds to maps wherever possible. Additionally, Simpleview is giving all CMS customers with MicroMaps or its own Map Publisher access to both platforms at no additional cost. Ultimately, the best features of each platform will be merged into one solution for all customers. \n\"As we considered this opportunity, we looked at not just what was good for our company, but also what was best for our customers,\" said Jorgen Clausen, previous director of MicroMaps. \"We wanted a good home for MicroMaps' DMO customers. I'm confident this will be a smooth transition and that customers will enjoy working with a company that not only wants the best for them, but can also deliver it, too.\" \nIn fact, the MicroMaps team has been retained to help in the transition process, continuing to support customers and participate in the product evolution. \nEmpowering DMOs for Service as Sales \nSimpleview's map products now offer features for any need, including: \n• Interactive diagram, photo or illustration mapping \n• Direct CRM data feed \n• Seamless delivery across desktop and mobile \n• Web-based, print-ready maps \n• Total customization for brand fidelity \n• Embedded 3D virtual tours, video, images and text \nThis acquisition advances one of the company's dominant new priorities: Helping DMOs win more meetings and events by offering planners a compelling set of tools, products and services. \n\"We know from our own research that more than half of meeting planners say the level of service a local DMO can offer is a factor in where they place their event, and more than 40% confirm the number and range of DMO services available to them is part of their decision-making,\" explained Ryan George Simpleview CEO. \nTo that end, the company has been steadily investing resources into exploring how it can arm DMOs with solutions for attendance building, event planning, data capture and great attendee experiences - further positioning DMOs as the leading resource for both meeting planners and event organizers. \n\"We're serious about giving DMOs this competitive advantage,\" George said. \"Our customers can expect more partnerships, more acquisitions and more R&D, all aimed at helping them service meetings and groups in ways they've never been able to before.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:18:54.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
