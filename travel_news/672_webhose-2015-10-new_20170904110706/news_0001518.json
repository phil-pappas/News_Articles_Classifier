Lei greetings for arrival at Honolulu International Airport may be purchased directly on hawaiidiscount.com. Although the purchase must be made during October, the arrival date may be any day in the future.\n“We are a small company and hope our contribution will help in the fight against breast cancer,” said Eagle Strayhorn, Digital Marketing Director at Hawaii Discount.\nWelcoming visitors to the Hawaiian Islands with a flower garland is a Hawaiian tradition that is still very popular today. In the early 1900s when boats were the only way to reach Hawaii, flower lei vendors lined the pier at Aloha Tower to welcome visitors to the Islands and local residents as they returned home. Things are a little faster paced with today's air travel, but flower lei greetings are still special and a celebration of a journey in life, just like breast cancer research represents a celebration of life by achieving a cure for this disease.\nMore information about how to order a Hawaiian flower lei for Honolulu airport arrivals may be found at hawaiidiscount.com.\nAbout Hawaii Discount:\nHawaii Discount was founded in 2001 with the purpose of offering visitors to Hawaii the best selection of activities and tours at reasonable prices. Since its beginning, Hawaii Discount has become the state’s largest and most respected Hawaii activity provider.\nAbout the Breast Cancer Research Foundation:\nThe Breast Cancer Research Foundation is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to achieve prevention and a cure for breast cancer by providing critical funding for cancer research worldwide.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYXdhaWlkaXNjb3VudC5jb20vbGVpLWdyZWV0aW5ncy5odG0=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5oYXdhaWlkaXNjb3VudC5jb20="], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:18:01.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
