(Fifty years ago, the entire area was cow pastures.) After everything was cleared (besides a couple of mango trees), things naturally appeared: papaya plants, culantro, chiles. Mr. Alba and his staff have since added various herbs, rows of squash and even a cacao tree. Some items are already on the menu, and Mr. Alba expects that within two or three years the garden will be able to fill most of their produce needs.\nLike the neighborhood that replaced those pastures, the interior of the 20-seat restaurant is a mix of styles: worn original gray-and-white checkered floors; a lacquered concrete bar with retrofitted bar stools and light fixtures; cookbooks and cocktail books lining the bar shelves, and just three small tables .\nAs I sipped a Birds of Paradise Fizz cocktail, their version of a 1940s classic, with house-made grenadine and herbs from the garden, I decided on the tasting menu over the à la carte options. Soon, a series of small plates came out, including shredded duck on a basil leaf paired with spherified passion fruit, and squash purée with con-colon, the crunchy rice from the bottom of the pan.\nThere are nods to traditional Panamanian products and dishes throughout the 11 courses, though Mr. Alba rearranges them to create flavors that are completely new. Black beans were topped with crumbled queso del país and lacto-fermented watermelon; Azuero Peninsula oysters were served with a coconut water sorbet. With the col-canelon, a sort of cabbage cannelloni that Mr. Alba eats at home, he said he wanted to avoid the heaviness of the soy it usually features, so he created his own umami with smoked pork and honey vinaigrette.\nThe drink pairings from Mr. Alba’s business partner and bar manager, Robert Martin, bounced around from natural wines to beer to a final digestif served in tea glasses and smoked in a glass box with nance wood, which left a scent that lingered on my fingertips long after I left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:53:45.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
