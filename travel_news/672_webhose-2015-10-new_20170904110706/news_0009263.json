Photo by Aero Icarus/Wikipedia We recently did a post on the top 10 safest aircraft, so it was only natural to take a look at the list of safest airlines. Every year, Germany’s Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC) releases its annual list based on an airline’s cumulative performance in the past 30 years. The organization has released its list for 2015.\nNumber one on the list is Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific . JADEC says the carrier has had no fatalities and no hull loss events in the past three decades. Next on the list is Abu Dhabi-based Emirates , the largest airline in the Middle East. JADEC lauded the carrier for this achievement despite a period of immense growth from the 1990s until now.\nOn the list at number three is Taiwan-based Eva Air , which JADEC says it has always been among the best in terms of operational safety.\nBut because of its smaller size, the airline lacks substantial numbers of revenue traffic and only began operating in 1991.\nThe Netherlands’ KLM came in fifth place, making it Europe’s safest airline. Rounding out the top 10 are: Air New Zealand , Qantas , China’s Hainan Airlines , JetBlue (the only U.S. carrier in the top 10) and Etihad Airways .\nThe JADEC report noted that Malaysia Airlines falling from number 34 to number 57 on the list, driven by the disappearance of Flight 370 and the shooting down of Flight 17.\nThe safest regions in the world, according to JADEC, were North America and Eurasia, which includes Russia and the countries east of Ukraine, with the region not posting a single flight accident death. The Latin America region posted 10 deaths, mostly on flights with vintage machines on non-scheduled operations.\nAfrica experienced 18 aircraft losses and 134 fatalities in 2014, JADEC reported. The most deaths occurred in the Asia-Pacific region, where the half of all fatalities occured in 2014, it added.\nJADEC is not the only organization to rate airline safety. In its latest list, AirlineRatings.com rated Qantas number one, based on the Australian flag carrier’s fatality-free record in the jet era. It was followed on the list in alphabetical order by Air New Zealand, British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Eva Air, Finnair, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. The rankings, according to the website, are based a range of factors related to audits from aviation’s governing bodies such as the FAA and ICAO as well as government audits and the airline’s fatality record.", "external_links": ["http://www.airnewzealand.com/", "http://www.evaair.com/en-us/index.html", "http://www.hainanairlines.com/", "http://www.qantas.com.au/", "http://www.emirates.com/us/English/index.aspx?Standard&#61;yes&gclid&#61;CLiomZ2ZssMCFRQQ7Aod914AQg", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://airtravel.about.com/od/airlines/fl/Top-10-Safest-Airlines.htm?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=shareurlbuttons_nip&media=http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/S/H/L/1024px-Cathay_Pacific_Boeing_777-300ER;_B-KPF@HKG;31.07.2011_614oq_-6053398096.jpg&description=JADEC", "http://www.cathaypacific.com/cx/en_US.html", "http://www.etihad.com/", "http://www.airlineratings.com/news/425/worlds-safest-airlines-for-2015#sthash.dljTFmbU.dpuf", "http://f.tqn.com/y/airtravel/1/W/H/L/1024px-Cathay_Pacific_Boeing_777-300ER;_B-KPF@HKG;31.07.2011_614oq_-6053398096.jpg", "http://www.malaysiaairlines.com/", "http://www.jacdec.de/", "https://www.klm.com/home/us/en"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:17:23.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
