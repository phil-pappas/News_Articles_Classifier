With its adjoining Richard C. Holbrooke Conference Center, the Hope Hotel has expanded into business, leisure travel and events, putting a heavy demand on their technology infrastructure. In particular, the guest WiFi was stressed and customers were demanding better Internet. General Manager George Bleichert needed a smart solution to improve the guest WiFi experience. His 266 rooms were running nearly maximum occupancy, with guests bringing several devices per room. \"With a full hotel and busy conference center, we were seeing thousands of simultaneous devices trying to connect on the WiFi network,\" said George \"and, even with recent increases in bandwidth, the Internet circuit couldn't handle the demand.\" Active WiFi users were flooding the network during peak hours, when they needed it most. He needed a fast, effective and economical solution. He reached out to Travis Tangeman , the CTO of HarborLink Network, ( www.harborlink.net ), a technology solutions provider that specializes in public-facing WiFi networks. \"We have seen an explosion in data throughput resulting from cloud-based applications, streaming video and people traveling with multiple devices. We worked with the Hope Hotel to quadruple bandwidth over the past four years, and it still wasn't enough to handle peak load periods on the circuit.\" Travis noted that \"the trend is only getting worse, particularly in public venues where people expect fast, reliable connections, but often encounter slow, congested Internet resulting from unmanaged bandwidth.\"To manage the busy, congested WiFi network at Hope Hotel, HarborLink deployed an innovative new technology called \"The Governor™\" ( www.cirrusworks.net ). Through some very fast, and intelligent software, The Governor™ solves Internet congestion problems in microseconds, as they arise, by allocating bandwidth among active users on the network. This active decision-engine is far more efficient than simply adding more bandwidth or using traditional traffic shaping tools. Users (guests, staff and visitors) and their applications are too diverse, and devices are too numerous to effectively manage with static rule sets or policies. More significantly, today's data traffic is mostly encrypted, thwarting efforts to inspect packets and prioritize applications. What was needed was a totally new approach to bandwidth congestion. HarborLink brought The Governor™ solution to the Hope Hotel, and the results have been remarkable. \"The guest WiFi experience improved immediately,\" said George. \"Customers are happier and hotel staff relieved of managing service tickets.\" What is more, the solution paid for itself in a few months when balanced against support costs and additional bandwidth expense. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:03:14.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
