Dewayne Bevil Contact Reporter Theme Park Ranger It's fall, so nearly fa-la-la-la-la-la time at Disney \nThe temps and the humidity dip a bit, the kids are settled into school, your Halloween plans are solidifying and — boom — suddenly it's mid-October and we're just days away from celebrating the Christmas season. \nSeriously, on Nov. 8, just about two weeks from now, Disney World will kick off its yuletide festivities with the first day of Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party at Magic Kingdom and the debut of the finale for the Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights at Disney's Hollywood Studios. \nTwo weeks. And I've barely started my shopping. \nActually, Osbornaholics who are annual passholders can see the lights in action in preview evenings from Nov. 1 to Nov. 5. \nIt's a bittersweet occasion as Disney is turning off the 5 million lights after this season. The company said last month that preparation for new lands themed to \"Star Wars\" and \"Toy Story\" would prohibit it from running the Spectacle in the future. The Magic Kingdom puts on this special event each season. \nThis will be the 20th year for the Osborne Family presentation, an event I think I'll miss. It's a show that I don't mind a big crowd during — so much of the action happens way above the heads of the masses, and it's just so darn festive. \nI may be just melancholy enough to try the new — for three nights only — Merry & Bright Dinner Reception. The event menu includes holiday fare such as shrimp, beef and turkey alongside wine, beer specialty drinks and nonalcoholic beverages. Participants also get a reserved spot to watch the lights do their thing plus a \"custom shadow box keepsake featuring their own Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights,\" according to Disney World's official website. The price is $99 ($54 for ages 3 to 9), and the event runs nightly from Jan. 1 to Jan. 3. Admission to Hollywood Studios also is required. Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World transforms each year for the holiday season. New for 2014 are arches holding wreaths high above the sidewalks of Main Street U.S.A. instead of garland stretching across the streets as it has in the past. \nOr if the exit of the lights is leaving you with bitter taste in your mouth, there's the Merry & Bright Dessert Party, running nightly between Nov. 6 and Dec. 30. It's $69 ($39 for ages 3-9) and they throw in a stadium blanket. \nReservations can be made at disneyworld.com or by calling 407-939-3463. \nBy Candlelight \nIn other holiday notes, Disney has finalized its list of narrators for the 2015 edition of Candlelight Processional, the annual retelling of the Christmas story at Epcot. New participants include Chandra Wilson, Daniel Dae Kim, America Ferrera and the previously announced Meredith Vieira. \nI like to watch the newbies for their very first readings. They have no rehearsal with the mass choir and orchestra, so there's a some sensory overload and often emotional outpouring. \nSix narrators had been announced during the summer. The complete lineup, subject to change, includes Gary Sinise (Nov. 27-29), Neil Patrick Harris (Nov. 30-Dec. 3), Whoopi Goldberg (Dec. 4-5), Joe Morton (Dec. 6-8), Ana Gasteyer (Dec. 9-11), Vieira (Dec. 12-14), Ferrera (Dec. 15-17), Wilson (Dec. 18-20), Kim (Dec. 21-23), Edward James Olmos (Dec. 24-26), Blair Underwood (Dec. 27-28) and Amy Grant (Dec. 29-30). \nThe program runs three times nightly at the park's America Gardens Theatre, beginning at 5 p.m., 6:45 p.m. and 8:15 p.m. The event is included in regular Epcot admission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:25:36.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
