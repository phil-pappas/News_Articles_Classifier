Credit: ITV News Anglia Roads across Cambridgeshire are to get a £6.3 million upgrade.\nImprovements on the A14 and M11 will start this winter. The work will involve resurfacing, safety barrier renewal, bridge repairs, replacing and installing new signs, repairing damaged kerbs and replacing road markings.\nThe idea is to reduce congestion and it should be finished by next summer.\nBalfour Beatty will be carrying out the works on behalf of Highways England.\n\"The appointment of the contractors is a vital part of the delivery of improvements to some of our major roads in Cambridgeshire. This scheme will make journeys better for local people by improving safety for the thousands of drivers that use these roads each day. We will work with the contractors on how the works will affect people, but I’d like to assure drivers, where possible, disruption will be kept to a minimum and to bear with us while we continue to carry out this vital work to improve the existing road network.”\n– Aran Nugent, Service Delivery Team Leader at Highways England, All of the work will be carried out overnight to keep disruption to a minimum.\nMore details will be released in the coming weeks.\nLast updated Tue 20 Oct 2015 Travel Cambridgeshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:23:30.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
