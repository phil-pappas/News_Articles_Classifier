They are ideally suited to operations in the challenging geographical and climatic conditions found in remote parts of mountainous regions, northern latitudes, tropical regions with hot and wet climates, and over water.\nToday more than 60 Ka-32 helicopters operate in South Korea, where they have racked up more than 100,000 hours of flying time. Forest Aviation Headquarters uses the helicopters for firefighting, while the Armed Forces deploy them on search-and-rescue operations. The country’s coastguard operates Ka-32s to patrol Korea’s inshore waters. In addition they are used by commercial operators for cargo transportation, construction work, logging and other tasks.\nSouth Korea’s police force deploys the Mi-171A2, one of the aircraft of the Mi-8/17 series, for routine patrols and special operations. It is the only helicopter in the Korean police force’s fleet able to fly over the sea for distances of up to 250 km.\nThere are currently two service centres in South Korea for servicing Russian-built helicopters: one at LG International and the second at Forest Aviation Headquarters.\nRussian Helicopters , (part of State Corporation Rostec), is one of the global leaders in helicopter production and the only helicopter design and production powerhouse in Russia. Russian Helicopters was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Moscow. The company comprises five helicopter production facilities, two design bureaus, a spare parts production and repair facility, as well as an aftersale service branch responsible for maintenance and repair in Russia and all over the world. Its helicopters are popular among Russian ministries and state authorities (Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Emergency Control Ministry), operators (Gazpromavia, UTair), major Russian corporations. In 2014 its IFRS revenues increased 22,8% to RUB 169,8 billion. Deliveries reached 271 helicopters.\nState Corporation Rostec is a Russian corporation founded in 2007 for the purpose of promoting the development, production and export of hi-tech civilian and military industry products.
