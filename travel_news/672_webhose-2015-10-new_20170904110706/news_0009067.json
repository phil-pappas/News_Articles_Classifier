Though affected by the economic crisis and government tax policies that affected the small firms, as a whole, the regional market continues to dominate the global market, with the growing automobile industry in the country. Over 95% of the aluminum die-casting produced in the U.S is made from post-consumer recycled aluminum, subsequently leading to aluminum content of municipal solid waste decline to less than 1% in 2014.\nEmpire Die Casting, an Ohio -based aluminum and zinc die caster, and other plants have installed advanced electric aluminum melting, distribution and holding systems that will cut the amount of energy needed to melt aluminum by 80%. Die casters have successfully implemented a closed loop system to recycle and reuse as much material as possible within their processes. They recycle everything from office paper to hydraulic fluid to machining chips. This results in very little waste being transported to the landfill. These steps taken by the Die casting firms within the U.S and across the North America , acted as major driving factors for a sustained growth of the market in the country. Increased automation in the die casting industry spiked the productivity and a parallel demand for the former from the automotive industry is dragging the attention of automotive manufacturers towards highly durable aluminum die casting parts.\nThe market is segmented based on the production process type, and by application type. In a nutshell, automobile makers are now focusing on collaborating with the part die casting manufacturers in order to produce fuel-efficient and lightweight automobiles.\nReport offers the following:\nThis report on U.S automotive aluminum parts die casting market, analyzes the current market trends within U.S. in detail.\nThis report offers the technical aspects and economic data of the market and its forecast to the next 5 years (2015-2020).\nIt also discusses the latest technologies in the U.S. automotive aluminum die casting materials and parts that are under development and in research pipeline.\nThis report provides the list of major players in the market and gives an in depth analyst perspective of what makes the products and strategies of these players stand out.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3320489/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/us-automotive-parts-aluminum-die-casting-market---growth-trends-forecast-2015-2020-300158310.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3320489/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR25979&Transmission_Id=201510121913PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR25979&DateId=20151012", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-automotive-parts-aluminum-die-casting-market---growth-trends-forecast-2015-2020-300158310.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:02:51.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
