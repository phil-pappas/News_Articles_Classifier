The crew of United 232 that landed the DC-10 with no hydraulics would be contenders, as would the crew of the DHL A300 that took a missile strike after taking off from Baghdad, sustained major damage and still landed safely.\nQ: I am 15 years old and love reading your column. I have a question about Flight 232 (my grandpa was a firefighter on the ground when it crashed). What did the pilot do to save that plane from even more casualties?\n— Chris G, West Des Moines\nA: In the Sioux City, Iowa, crash of 1989, the entire crew worked together to control the crippled DC-10. They only had engine thrust to maintain very limited control. They navigated to an airport, had emergency crews standing by and made as gentle a touchdown as they could. It was remarkable airmanship.\nQ: Was the landing on the Hudson River as astounding as it seemed? Could others do what Capt. Sullenberger did?\n— Daniel Highland, Oregon House, Calif.\nA: Captain Sullenberger and the crew of US Airways 1549 did a great job dealing with a very intense emergency. I would expect other crews would have done a similar job. Airline crews are very well-trained, and there are some very talented aviators flying. I hope none ever has to face similar circumstances.\nQ: Haynes vs. Sullenberger?\n— C T Bevan, Ellensburg, Wash.\nA: Al Haynes, the captain of United 232, landed his DC-10 with no hydraulic power and with one engine inoperative. The airplane was considered to be unflyable, yet the crew managed to get it to touch down in Sioux City, Iowa.\nSully Sullenburger (a longtime friend) lost both engines because of bird strikes and landed his A320 in the Hudson. He and Jeff Skiles, the first officer, applied their training, skill and airmanship to land the crippled airliner successfully.\nThere is not a comparison between the two. Rather they are both examples of the professionals who fly our airplanes. Neither Captain Haynes nor Captain Sullenburger expected to face such catastrophic emergencies, but both were able to deal with them when they occurred. The training of professional pilots gave them the tools, their skill and poise gave them the good results.\nJohn Cox is a retired airline captain with US Airways and runs his own aviation safety consulting company, Safety Operating Systems.\nLoading...\n8 CONNECT 12 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1LpAddk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1LpAddk", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LpAddk&text=Ask%20the%20Captain%3A%20Examples%20of%20amazing%20airmanship&via=usatoday", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dGk3WUFiTTl3VUNWX2d2bXRqVFZoUUE6MQ", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/958203890d77c451a87b225a2f89007fe0ffea31/c=130-0-2791-2001&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799441387298213-83892SW002-CAPT-SULLENBE.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LpAddk&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:00:20.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
