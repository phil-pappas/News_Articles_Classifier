Adding to this startling statistic, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports phone use when behind the wheel causes one in every five teen distracted driving fatalities. Digital distractions along with failure to learn safe driving techniques have both contributed to motor vehicle crashes becoming the leading cause of death among teens in the United States .\nTo help keep teens safe on the road, The UPS Foundation teamed up with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to create UPS Road Code , a national program educating teens on safe driving techniques. Celebrating its sixth anniversary in 2015, the highly successful UPS Road Code program enables teens to drive change for themselves and their peers through a combination of classroom sessions and the use of a driving simulator. In addition to the hands on support of the volunteer UPS instructors, the program now offers online resources for parents and teen drivers to prepare for the realities of the road. To date the program has reached 20,000 participants since its launch in 2009 and is available in 52 Boys & Girls Clubs throughout 40 U.S. cities.\nNational Teen Driver Safety Week\nThrough the UPS Road Code program, The UPS Foundation and Boys & Girls Clubs of America are lending their support to National Teen Driver Safety Week (NTDSW). Held this year from October 18-24 , NTDSW is a week annually designated by Congress to raise awareness of teen driver safety topics and to encourage safe teen driver and passenger behavior. With an average of nearly eight teens dying each day in car crashes (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety), the focus of NTDSW and UPS Road Code is to inspire parents, teens and educators to take a firm stance on teen driver safety within their local communities in an effort to ensure bright futures for America's youth.\nSafety First\nReaching 20,000 teens since its inception in 2009, UPS Road Code provides participants with unparalleled training from UPS employees committed to safety within their communities. The program is largely based on the same methods used by UPS drivers, who are known for their safe driving techniques. In fact, UPS's 102,000 drivers worldwide are among the safest on the roads, logging more than three billion miles per year and delivering more than four billion packages safely. UPS also has more than 7,875 members in its \"Circle of Honor\" program, recognizing drivers who can boast 25 years or more of safe driving. Taught by approximately 125 UPS employees trained as volunteer instructors, the program provides teens with a combination of classroom-based instruction, as well as time \"behind the wheel\" of a virtual driving simulator.\nThe program focuses on different safety principles, from basic instruction to the consequences of risky behaviors such as talking on cell phones, texting or drinking while driving. Teens practice what they've learned on the driving simulators, which feature a computer screen that serves as a windshield to the program's interactive animation, a steering wheel and life-like gas and brake pedals.\nDriving Change\nIn 2015, Boys & Girls Clubs of America and The UPS Foundation continue to drive awareness of UPS Road Code and educate teens by hosting free community events at local Boys & Girls Clubs in various cities throughout the country. Events include fun activities and challenges, as well as the chance for attendees to interact with the program's driving simulators. Participants also have the opportunity to sign a petition , pledging to make the roads safer by not driving distracted.\nIn addition, teens nationwide have the opportunity to make a difference and drive change for themselves and their peers. Using social media, such as the UPS Road Code Facebook page , teens can share online tools and resources developed to spread the word about road safety. From tips and statistics to an online quiz and info on safe driving techniques , the program aims to help teens to be aware of the potential dangers they may face on the road and enable them to share those insights with friends and family.\n\"The UPS Road Code program is more than just a safe-driving program; it's about encouraging teens to act as a catalyst for driving change,\" said Myron Gray , president, UPS U.S. operations. \"UPS Road Coad is dedicated to finding the best tools for teens by providing them with encouraging role models that will assist them in becoming ambassadors of safety. We look forward to continuing to help them drive positive change in their communities.\"\nThe UPS Road Code program is available to teens at Boys & Girls Clubs in the following cities:\n1.
