(NYSE: CNW), announced today that Lawrenceville -based Driver Sales Representative Dennis Day has surpassed 3 million consecutive, accident-free miles. He becomes the ninth driver in the company's 33-year history to achieve this remarkable safe-driving milestone.\nDay, who was honored at a special ceremony today at the company's Norcross Service Center, previously earned recognition for surpassing 1 and 2 million safe-driving miles. He is a former Georgia Truck Driver of the Year and a Captain of the American Trucking Associations' Road Team.\n\"Dennis is an incredible ambassador for Con-way Freight and truckers as a whole,\" said Tom Clark , senior vice president of operations for Con-way Freight. \"Our top priority is safety, and he exemplifies that in every aspect of his job. Whether a driver is new or has been on the road for 20 years, Dennis is someone he or she can look to as an inspiration of excellence and commitment to safety.\"\nTo put this 3 million mile safe-driving accomplishment into perspective, consider that it equates to circumnavigating the Earth at the equator 120.5 times, traversing the length of 52.8 million football fields, traveling the distance of the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine 1,360 times or driving round-trip from Atlanta to Los Angeles 690 times.\n\"There's nothing more important than safety,\" said Day. \"When you're driving a truck of this size, it takes precision, focus and constant attentiveness to ensure your safety, as well as the safety of the other motorists and pedestrians. It's an honor to be recognized for this achievement, and I hope this motivates other drivers to be as safe as possible on the road.\"\n\" Dennis Day is one of the best professional drivers I have ever known,\" said Guy Young , vice president of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association. \"He has successfully combined a 3 million mile highway safety record with exceptional company and customer service. Dennis is detail oriented and takes pride in doing things right while always remembering to do what is right by his high ethical and moral standards. He has dedicated his life to his family, to his friends and to giving his very best to his employer and to the trucking industry. I have known Dennis and his family for more than 20 years and no one is more deserving of this special honor. Dennis, congratulations. GMTA is proud of you and your outstanding record of achievements.\"\nDay joined Con-way Freight in 1987 and has been a professional truck driver for more than 34 years. He is a nine-time Georgia State Trucking Class Champion and was the Champion of the Twin Truck Class at the 2007 National Truck Driving Championships. He has received Con-way's Quarterly Leadership Award four times and has served as a mentor for Con-way Freight drivers, while also being a member of Operation Lifesaver, Highway Watch and Trucker Buddy International. He resides in Lawrenceville with his wife, Maryann.\nFollow Con-way Freight on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/CNWFreight .\nCon-way Freight Equipment Images are available at: https://www.con-way.com/brand_standards/pictures_logos_and_icons/con-way-freight-equipment .\nAbout Con-way Freight\nCon-way Freight is the industry's leading less-than-truckload (LTL) freight transportation company, providing guaranteed, day-definite regional and transcontinental service with exception-free delivery, on-time service performance and faster transit times through a single, unified network of more than 425 service locations serving the United States , Canada , Mexico and Puerto Rico .
