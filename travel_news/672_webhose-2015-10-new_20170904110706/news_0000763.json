At the annual ceremony the brand picked up three awards; two silvers and one gold, making it the joint best performer on the night.\nThe awards recognised Lime Venue Portfolio for its performance in the Best Use of Social Media (Silver), Best Direct Mail (Gold) and Best Use of Budget (Silver) categories; underlining the breadth of marketing expertise the brand has delivered for its venue clients over the last 12 months.\nLime Venue Portfolio received the Gold award for its “GIANT” campaign, which saw a targeted number of key customers sent oversized advent calendars and huge chocolate Easter eggs. The campaign communicated the message that the portfolio offers the largest collection of unusual venues and then further engaged the audience with a concurrent social media campaign.\nSpeaking after the awards, Richard Kadri-Langford, Head of Marketing at Lime Venue Portfolio, commented, ”This is an outstanding accolade for the brand and one we couldn’t have gained without the support of our venue clients across the country. To be recognised as delivering excellence in both social and direct marketing means we’re performing in new and more established mediums, whilst Best Use of Budget shows our campaigns are cutting through the “noise” and delivering more bang for our buck..“\n“Our primary role is to support our venues with high quality sales and marketing; the awards are given based on strong creative strategies, implementation, but most of all on return on investment, so this is a real pat on the back for us all,” concluded Richard.\nLime Venue Portfolio is the UK’s largest collection of unusual, sporting and cultural venues. The brand delivers sales and marketing support as a division of Levy Restaurants UK the sport, leisure and hospitality division of Compass Group UK & Ireland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:33:18.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
