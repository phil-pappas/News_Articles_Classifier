Net income for the third quarter was $188.0 million compared to $190.5 million recorded for the same period in the previous year. Earnings per share on a diluted basis were $1.24 , equal to the earnings per share for the third quarter last year. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 4% and earnings per share by $0.05 in the third quarter.\nThe Company's 2% third quarter sales decline included underlying sales growth of 1% and a 1% contribution from acquisitions, offset by a currency headwind of approximately 4%. Sales for the Automotive Group were down 2% reflecting core automotive growth of 4% offset by a 6% impact of currency. Sales at Motion Industries, our Industrial Group, were down by approximately 4%, which basically represents the underlying decrease for this business, as a 1% contribution from acquisitions was offset by an equal currency headwind. Sales at EIS, our Electrical/Electronic Group, increased by 2% and included approximately 5% growth from acquisitions, offset by a 1.5% decrease in core sales and a 1.5% negative impact of copper pricing. Sales for S. P. Richards , our Office Products Group, were up 3%, which essentially reflects the underlying growth for this business in the quarter.\nTom Gallagher , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"The strength in our underlying Automotive distribution business, as well as positive sales growth in the Office and Electrical distribution businesses, was offset by significant foreign currency headwinds and ongoing challenging global economic conditions, particularly in our Industrial distribution business. These factors pressured our overall sales and earnings growth as we moved through the third quarter, although our focus on streamlining operations and controlling expenses drove positive margin expansion.\"\nSales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $11.60 billion , up 1% compared to 2014. Net income for the nine months was $544.4 million , basically unchanged from 2014, and earnings per share on a diluted basis were $3.56 , up 1% compared to $3.53 in 2014. Currency negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 3% and earnings per share by $0.11 for the nine months.\nMr. Gallagher added, \"We enter the fourth quarter facing market conditions that have softened, most prominently in our Industrial and Electrical businesses. Based on these uncertain conditions, which are likely to persist through the balance of the year, we expect sales and earnings to be further challenged as we work our way through the final quarter of 2015.\"\nMr. Gallagher concluded, \"We have initiatives in place in each of our businesses which are designed to stimulate sales and earnings growth in the coming quarters. While these initiatives will take time to fully materialize in our quarterly results, our teams are committed to generating growth both organically and through selective accretive acquisitions that should enhance the long-term growth profile of our four businesses in the coming years. Our strong cash flow generation, driven by significant working capital improvement and our strong balance sheet provide us with the ability to support these initiatives. Additionally, we expect to continue to maximize shareholder value with our dividend and ongoing share repurchase program.\"\nConference Call\nGenuine Parts Company will hold a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the results of the quarter and the future outlook.
