Booking.com will be the first TPG brand to be made available. \n\nWith instant booking, travellers will be able to see Booking.com -branded hotel listings and can simply click on the “book now” button to book stays on TripAdvisor. The site will let consumers know that their hotel bookings are being settled by Booking.com and that its representatives will handle all of the customer care. \n\nIn time, priceline.com and Agoda.com will also likely list their inventories on TripAdvisor. Development work has already begun to support the integration of TPG hotel properties, and is expected to launch soon. \n\nStephen Kaufer, president and CEO of TripAdvisor, said: “TripAdvisor users coming to the site to plan, compare prices and book their trip will be able to instantly book options from TPG’s global hotel inventory in addition to the 235,000 properties that are already instantly bookable on TripAdvisor.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:03:11.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
