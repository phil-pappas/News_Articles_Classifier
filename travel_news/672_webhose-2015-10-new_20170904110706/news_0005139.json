Spending 12 days flying to every continent (except Antarctica) on 16 flights, only ever leaving a plane for a quick layover at the airport.\nBut for Sydney businessman Matthias Fuchs, 47, it’s a crazy challenge with a special message.\nOn 2 November, Fuchs will begin a flying marathon to raise money and awareness for cystic fibrosis, Fuchs’ 13-year-old daughter Kristen has cystic fibrosis.\nSpending almost 200 hours in the air, travelling 167,000km, the trip will include six Pacific Ocean crossings and four Indian Ocean crossings. He will take just carry-on luggage and for 12 consecutive days will eat, sleep, live and breathe on planes.\nFor Fuchs, flying is a lifelong obsession. He has recorded every single flight he has been on since he was born — an incredible 1232 flights, which equates to around one flight every 10 days.\n“As a pilot friend of mine said, I’ve got more flying time than a first officer in a 747,” says Fuchs, who has previously completed this challenge in 2011 and 2013, but never for this length of time.\nMatthias Fuchs and his daughter, Kristen, 13, who has cystic fibrosis.

Tokyo and LA are not so bad,” he says.\nSo what are the biggest challenges of flying solidly for 12 days straight?\n“The one thing I find the most challenging is the habit of airlines to immediately close the blinds on a day flight, it means I’m permanently in darkness,” says Fuchs.\nHe also has to inject himself daily with Clexane to avoid Deep Vein Thrombosis, drink lots of fluid and he limits alcohol to around one or two wines a day.\n“To not take precautions would be silly,” he says.\nMatthias’ massive flight routes are mapped out. Source: Supplied\nSurprisingly, Fuchs says the biggest benefit is that there is no jet lag.\n“Your body doesn’t stop in different time zones long enough so it naturally reverts back to Sydney time, no matter where you are,” says Fuchs, who manages an average of only four hours sleep a day on the challenge.\nThis daunting fact has attracted the attention of one of the world’s leading sleep professors, Professor Ron Grunstein, who will use Fuchs as a type of “guinea pig”. He will wear a fitbit and have swabs of his cheeks taken everyday to assess the impact of sleep and how the body changes.\nFuchs says he has a military routine when it comes to flying. He has his earplugs ready to go and makes sure he boards early to snag a spot for his cabin luggage.\nWhen possible he tries to book the bulk head seat in the front row so he can put his feet up on the wall, he likes a window during day flights and an aisle for overnight.\nAs for his family, “they think I’m mad of course”, he says, whose wife meets him during the challenge at Sydney airport with fresh shirts and underwear.\nFuchs has so far raised $130,000 with all funds going directly to the Cystic Fibrosis Unit at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead. His target is $150-$200K which would fund a part-time researcher for two years to continue to improve treatment efficiency. His two previous challenges raised a combined total of $270,000. The public can donate to his cause on his dedicated page .\nCystic Fibrosis is the most common life threatening recessive gene condition. It attacks the lungs and digestive system with repeated infections leading to lung damage and eventually respiratory failure.\nMatthias meets many pilots on his journey.
