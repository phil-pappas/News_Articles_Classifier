Speaking about the importance of developments in the field of smart technology, Major General Ahmad Mohammad Al Merri, Director General of the GDRFA, said officers at the directorate are continuously trained to stay up to date with the developments and give the best service they can to GDRFA customers. \nHe also said that the GDRFA is planning on introducing an Innovation and Creativity Lab. \n“The lab will act as a mediator to those who are trying to secure copyrights to their intellectual property,” Al Merri said, “The plan is still in its developmental phase but we are trying to establish a system which will help innovators in the country easily get their copyrights, ensuring that they are not wronged from what is theirs.” Amer Robot, was developed by a Korean technology company in cooperation with the GDRFA Oct 21, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:12:42.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
