There are also not many breaks to be had at the hotels in the middle of autumn, high season in Napa. \nSome of the valley’s approximately 5,000 commercial hotel rooms can set you back quite a bit. \nBut even in splashy, high-rolling Napa, there are a few deals available, especially now, as the busy fall gives way to the sleepier winter. “You can still find something well located and comfortable at a moderate price point in Napa,” says Crystal-Rose Britto , whose Concierge of the Valley company has put together trips to Napa since 2005. More Napa Valley Venture beyond the valley floor in Napa \n“You just have to be a little savvy, to know what’s important to you and what you can live without.” \nHerewith some strategies, online and off, for finding a nice place to stay in Napa on a fair-to-middling budget, plus a short list of some inns that tend to offer both charm and value. \n1. Choose winter and weekday: In general, the most expensive nights are Friday and Saturday nights in high season, roughly May to November. Visitors can expect some discount (between 10 and 25 percent, usually) if they’re willing to book on what local hoteliers call weeknights (Sunday to Thursday) or during the winter. “It’s not all bad, coming then. It’s better for restaurant reservations; better access to the wine makers; often slower, more careful tastings,” says another Napa fixer, Michael Noel of MG Concierge. \n2. Book early: Those committed to coming during the big box office harvest, though, can score savings by booking a long time in advance. “Our pricing works in part by supply and demand,” says Mercedes Camacho , an executive at the Villagio and the neighboring Vintage, both inns in popular Yountville. “You can get a big discount if you book in, say, January for October, when demand for rooms hasn’t yet become brisk.” \n3. Book late: There are deals to be had at the other extreme, too, for the impulse traveler. On the analog side: The Napa Welcome Center offers a clearinghouse of often deeply discounted, unfilled rooms on the day of (at (855) 333-6272). On the digital side: The app Hotel Tonight covers Napa. (The Welcome Center gets immediate updates on room availability via cloud-based Jackrabbit software, and tends to hold its own: It recently had a room at Napa’s Bel Abri for $149, compared with $286 on the app, as well as live advice on why to stay where.) \n4. Use tech aids: The app and website Trivago also covers Napa, and shops around for the best rates offered by assorted accommodation sites — like the meta-travel site Kayak. For the real bargain hound, Hotwire has unidentified hotels bid against one another, in a game of How Low Can You Go — Seth Kugel , the New York Times ’ budget-travel specialist, recently used it to find a clean, plain motel room in Napa for just under $80 — almost unheard of in Napa. \n5. Rent a home: Home-sharing sites Airbnb and VRBO are both controversial in Napa — executives at two local tourist agencies told me zoning made it illegal for owners to rent out their homes in this way in large swaths of the county. Maybe for this reason, the offerings aren’t copious, most in the $100 to $300 range, with some couch-surfs for even less. \n6. Mention Triple-A: That trusty American Automobile Association membership can still reduce rates at many inns by a quarter — a Napa Marriott recently cut its overnight from $200 to $150 for cardholders. \n7. Go city or country: Call it the Thomas Keller premium — Yountville is currently Napa’s “it” town. There are still some deals to be had there, but they’re more likely to be found at properties in the city of Napa, or, farther up the valley, in St. Helena or Calistoga. \nAlec Scott is a freelance writer. E-mail: travel@sfchronicle.com . \nCharm on a budget \nCalistoga Inn and Brewery: This 17-room, family-run hotel in a recently restored Victorian offers handsome, high-ceilinged rooms, with shared (but privacy-protective) bathrooms. 1250 Lincoln Ave., Calistoga, (707) 942-4101, www.calistogainn.com. Rooms from $129-$169. \nChurchill Manor Bed & Breakfast: Engineer Brian Jensen and tax attorney Joanna Guidotti were still courting when, in 1987, they decided to take this porticoed, veranda-ed mansion (circa 1889) and make an inn of it. 485 Brown St., Napa, (707) 253-7733, www.churchillmanor.com. Rooms from $199-$379. \nEl Bonita: This old motor lodge is both cheap (by valley standards) and cheerful (with its neon signage and folk-art-style murals of vineyards) and so tends to book up months in advance. 195 Main St., St. Helena, (707) 963-3216, www.elbonita.com. Rooms from $89-$189. \nIndian Springs: A recent renovation has somehow both retained and freshened up this old spa hotel’s sleepy charm — it’s now like a retro-chic fantasia dreamed up by film director Wes Anderson . The old hot-spring-fed pool still stays open late, while a new addition, Sam’s Social Club , now offers chef Kory Stewart ’s riffs on American culinary classics. 1712 Lincoln Ave., Calistoga, (707) 942-4913, www.indianspringscalistoga.com. Rooms from $189-$489 \nVintage Inn: Happening Yountville has inns that are more swanky, but none as charming as this, with its tranquil courtyards and poolside ruled over by three hotel cats. You pay a premium for its location, across the street from Bouchon, but thrown-in extras (full breakfast, wine, parking) are many. 6541 Washington St., Yountville, (707) 944-1112, www.vintageinn.com. Rooms from $275-$550. Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:18:19.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
