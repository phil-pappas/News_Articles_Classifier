(\"Scientific Games\"), has signed a five-year contract with InComm , an Atlanta -based leading provider of prepaid and payment solutions, to provide lottery gift cards in North America . The agreement will enable Scientific Games' lottery customers to reach new consumers through a retail shopping experience in lottery jurisdictions across the continent.\nPat McHugh , Senior Vice President, North American Lottery Systems for Scientific Games, said, \"Imagine being able to give the fun and entertainment of lottery games with the convenience of a gift card. InComm is on the leading edge of commerce technology with strong retail partnerships. Their payment network and retail footprint, combined with Scientific Games' lottery solutions, offers lotteries a way to reach new consumers who may like to purchase lottery games and help drive incremental revenue for lottery beneficiaries such as local retailers, education, senior citizens, infrastructure and the environment.\"\nThe $73.8 billion (U.S.) North American lottery industry currently includes 55 state and provincial lotteries and nearly 270,000 lottery retailers.\nScott Meyerhoff , Chief Operating Officer of InComm, said, \"The ways consumers purchase and use gift cards is rapidly changing. In addition to being bought on special occasions for family and friends, gift cards are also bought year-round for self-use. Our agreement with Scientific Games is visionary for the North American lottery industry in many ways, particularly resonating with consumers who prefer cashless transactions at retail.\"\nWhile lottery retail networks are managed by individual lotteries, McHugh said that lottery retail locations generally do not overlap with InComm's 250,000 retail gift card distribution locations throughout North America , which could offer new retail channel opportunities and provide more consumer exposure to lottery games.\nConsumers can purchase InComm's single-load prepaid gift cards to fit their needs, whether for a gift or personal use. The gift cards can be used at any participating lottery retailer that has been authorized by a state lottery offering the gift card.\nAbout Scientific Games\nScientific Games Corporation (NASDAQ: SGMS) is a leading developer of technology-based products and services and associated content for worldwide gaming, lottery and interactive markets.
