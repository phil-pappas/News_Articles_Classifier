A ferry carrying 108 people from Rhodes reached the harbor of Datça on Oct. 17. Ferry services officially began around 15 years ago; however, the financial crisis in Greece and prohibitive harbor fees slowed down touristic activities. Tour agency representatives now say that Greek tourists mostly come to Turkey to shop, as new taxes have reduced the Greeks' purchasing power at home. On average, a tourist visiting from Rhodes spends 300 euros per trip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:09:20.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
