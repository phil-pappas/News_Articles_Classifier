Unique experiences and the human factor will become more important to people. The new value creation is about combining digital solutions with real experiences.\n“With my experience from high level political strategy and advising business leaders I am going to draw the map of what’s happening in the world and how this affects people and business. The explosion of information and knowledge, globalization and the real blockbuster in our time – the city – changes the world and creates new opportunities for people and businesses. I´m going to present tools for how to become a winner when the Urban Express alters our way of living.”\nThe event will also provide an opportunity for guests to network with fellow CEOs, Presidents, Vice Presidents, Senior Directors, Senior Decision Makers and Entrepreneurs and enjoy a themed dinner presented in the form of a traditional market.\nSource:- ibtm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:09:42.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
