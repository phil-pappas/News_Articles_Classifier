She died in April, barely two months after hosting what her invitations facetiously listed as a museum Seduction Party on Valentine's Day.\nNew Yorker Ivan Wilzig, 59, eldest of the three Wilzig sibling heirs, said Berlin's Humboldt University has expressed an interest in acquiring his mother's erotic art, and he's had discussions with university officials.\nHave you taken in all the local museums' exhibits? Looking for new ground to tackle? Well, TripAdvisor.com's latest list will have you salivating.

But Germany today is not the 1930s Germany he knew. Its Jewish population is increasing. And, frankly, I feel safer in Berlin than in Jerusalem, where terrorism is a constant fear.\"\nSiggi Wilzig, his father, was president and CEO of the Trust Co. of New Jersey, president and CEO of the Wilshire Oil Co. and a director of the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington.\nNaomi Wilzig seemed like the last person you'd expect to find in an erotic art museum, let alone operating one.\n\"Please emphasize that we're promoting education, not pornography,\" she urged me last year.\nDisplayed are nude paintings, cartoons and sculptures with many items explicitly depicting various aspects of sex play, some dating to biblical times. There are authenticated signed erotic sketches by Rembrandt, Picasso, Salvador Dali and Toulouse-Lautrec.\nWilzig wrote five books, picturing items from her erotica collection, and for her philanthropic and cultural contributions, she received numerous honors, including honorary doctor degrees from the Rabbinical College of America, headquartered in Morristown, N.J., and San Francisco's Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality.\nAdmission is $14, and children under 18 are not admitted.
