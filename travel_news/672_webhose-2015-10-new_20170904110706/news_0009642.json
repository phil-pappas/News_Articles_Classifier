It was a friend's 40th birthday party and I'd been to weddings that had involved less preparation. We couldn't be late. We'd barely made it a few miles down the road when the fuel gauge bleeped irritatingly. Pulling into the next petrol station, my partner, Ollie, began filling up and I went inside to pay. As I glanced through the kiosk window, Ollie's face contorted into a weird expression, as if he’d trodden on a bee or spilt diesel down his shirt. His hands flew to the air followed by an almighty face-plant. \"Petrol,\" he mouthed. \"I put petrol in.\" \"You idiot!\" I gasped. Our trusty Ford Galaxy ran on diesel. We'd had the car for two years. I couldn't believe that, after thousands of miles, Ollie had just filled it up with the wrong fuel. It was like giving candy floss to a diabetic, whisky to a reformed alcoholic It was like giving candy floss to a diabetic, whisky to a reformed alcoholic. You just didn't do it - unless you wanted to inflict some serious damage. I had no option but to pay for the fuel - seventy quid down the drain - literally. Two things were certain: one – the car was going nowhere. And two – we would be late for the party. Fortunately, we had breakdown insurance. But when I phoned the company I was informed that it didn't cover wrong fuel. Brilliant. We'd have been better off actually running out on the motorway. By now, there was a queue of cars waiting for the pump. But if we started the engine, it may never work again. \"Get in, I’ll push,\" said Ollie glumly. I sat fuming behind the steering wheel, while he manoeuvred the car to a layby. The cheapest \"fuel doctor\" we could find was £150 – and that was on top of the money we'd wasted on petrol. What's more he wasn’t available until the evening. We had no choice but to abandon the car until then, take a cab back home, collect Ollie's van that he used for work, and drive to the party in that instead. The taxi fare came to another £25 and it was all I could do not to throttle my other half. We arrived at the party almost two hours late. Ollie offered to drive home so that I could drink – given the circumstances, it was the least he could have done. After a couple of glasses of wine I forgave him, though I don’t think either of us will make that mistake again. Spend more time laughing and less time worrying behind the wheel.
