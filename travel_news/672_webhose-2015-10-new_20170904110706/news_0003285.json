At this time, no source has been identified and the investigation is ongoing. \nThe risk to Canadians is low. Salmonella bacteria are found naturally in the intestines of animals, reptiles and birds. The bacteria are most-often transmitted to people when they eat contaminated foods. Contaminated foods often come from animal sources, like poultry, beef, milk or eggs, but can also include fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Illness can be avoided if safe food handling, preparation, and cooking practices are closely followed. \nInvestigation Summary \nCurrently, there are 34 cases of Salmonella Infantis illness in eight provinces: British Columbia (3), Alberta (6), Saskatchewan (2), Manitoba (2), Ontario (16), Quebec (3) Nova Scotia (1), and New Brunswick (1). Individuals became sick between June 12 and September 20, 2015. The majority of cases (62%) are female, with an average age of 41 years. Eight people have been hospitalized, and all have recovered or are recovering. No deaths have been reported. To date, the source of this investigation has not been identified, but the investigation is ongoing, and Canadians will continue to be updated as new information becomes available. \nWho is most at risk \nAnyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection, but infants, children, seniors and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness, and can get sick more easily than others. \nMost people who become ill from a Salmonella infection will recover fully after a few days. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and not get sick or show any symptoms, but still be able to spread the infection to others. \nWhat you should do to protect your health \nSalmonella can be passed on from various sources including contaminated food, pets, and other environmental sources. Foods contaminated with Salmonella look, smell and taste normal. Salmonella illness can be avoided if precautions are taken. Follow the safety tips below to protect yourself and your family. \n• Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before and after handling all types of food products. \n• Cook food to a safe internal temperature that has been checked using a digital thermometer. \n• Keep raw food away from other food while shopping, storing, preparing and serving foods. \n• Wash fresh fruits and vegetables before eating them, clean counters and cutting boards and wash your hands regularly. \n• Always read and follow package cooking instructions, including products labelled Uncooked, Cook and Serve, Ready to Cook, and Oven Ready. \n• Use warm soapy water to clean knives, cutting boards, utensils, your hands and any surfaces that have come in contact with food, especially meat, poultry and fish. \n• Refrigerate or freeze perishable food within two hours of cooking. \n• Consume refrigerated leftovers within four days of cooking. Always reheat leftovers until steaming hot before eating. \n• Wash your hands after contact with animal feces (for example, after changing kitty litter or scooping up after your dog). \n• Keep pets away from food storage and preparation areas. Wash your hands well with soap and water after handling pet treats, pet food and pet toys, or after playing with or cleaning up after your pet. \n• If you have been diagnosed with a Salmonella infection or any other gastrointestinal illness, do not prepare food or pour water for other people. \nSymptoms \nSymptoms of a Salmonella infection, called salmonellosis, typically start 6 to 72 hours after ingesting the bacteria. \nSymptoms include:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:57:36.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
