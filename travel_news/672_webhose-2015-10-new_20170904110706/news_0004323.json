Germany has had what some describe as an extraordinary partnership with China since late 1970s. Companies such as Siemens, which has been in the country for more than 140 years, provided the engineering capability that China needed in its first stage of growth. Yet the next stage of development may see other countries take a front seat, such as Britain with its specialisation in financial services, health care, clean technology and life sciences. Law firm King & Wood Mallesons has predicted Britain’s foreign direct investment (FDI) asset stock in China would rise almost fourfold from £6.6 billion in 2014 to £25.6 billion by 2020 as China opens up its service sector to foreign investors. Germany would remain strong, it said, with the growth of its investment rising just over three times from £11.6 billion to £35.2 billion. Rob Day, a managing partner at King & Wood Mallesons, said the next stage of China’s development would likely benefiting Britain . \"“The cake is getting bigger and so everyone stands to benefit, but you would expect to see Britain’s share grow faster” Henry Bell, British Embassy, Beijing “This is a fundamental opportunity,” he said. “If you look in terms of asset stock, Germany is the biggest individual European investor in China. I think the gap may narrow. What is implicit is a faster degree of growth from Britain than from Germany.” There is certainly a lot to play for. Analysts have predicted FDI in China could almost double from a cumulative £667 billion last year to £1.3 trillion in 2020. “The cake is getting bigger and so everyone stands to benefit but you would expect to see Britain’s share grow faster,” said Henry Bell, first secretary at the British Embassy in Beijing. He said Prime Minister David Cameron talked of a new “growth partnership” between Britain and the world’s second-largest economy during a visit to the country in December 2013. “It’s based on the premise that Britain and China have very complementary strengths,” Mr Bell said. “Britain is benefiting from a rise in China’s middle class and the associated consumer demand. For example, our biggest exporter to China is Jaguar Land Rover, which is seeing fantastic year-on-year growth in sales.” However, Thomas Luedi, managing partner for Greater China with AT Kearney, said the Sino-German link was more than just a strong trade partnership and that it would take more than a transitioning economy to break it. “There is something that is very culturally close between the Germans and the Chinese,” he said. “If you look at China’s state-owned enterprises they are essentially run by engineers. Much of the government itself is made up of engineers. They appreciate the sharp engineering capability the Germans bring, the structure, quality and detail of their analytical approach. \"I don’t think it’s any coincidence that some of the first multinationals to come to China were German.” There is a lot of road left in the relationship, he said, because China would still need German engineering to complete its urbanisation. “China is still only just over 50 per cent urbanised so the urbanisation journey hasn’t ended. German companies will still have a lot of opportunities.” Joerg Wuttke, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, said the existing European Union trade relationship with China was not as German-dominated as many would assume. “You might not see many British cars here, apart from Minis and Jaguars, or the big physical presence that companies such as Siemens and others have, but you have huge investment coming out of Britain into China,” he said. “A lot of this is portfolio investment that comes via Hong Kong. It is often invested in Chinese companies or joint ventures.” Some of the British investment from Hong Kong might actually be reflected in the FDI figures. About 68 per cent of China’s FDI came from Hong Kong last year, according to King & Wood Mallesons. This compares with just one per cent directly from Britain, 1.75 per cent from Germany and 0.65 per cent from France. The top four investors were all from Asia. Russell Brown, managing partner at accountants Lehman Brown, said the attitude towards China among British companies had changed dramatically. “The attitude even a couple of years ago was that China was one of many markets. (Companies) sometimes were influenced by all the supposed horror stories rather than the good news stories,” he said. Mr Brown, who is also honorary chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China and vice-chairman of the China-Britain Business Council, said there has been an influx of British service businesses, particularly in architectural and interior design as well as product and brand design. “The thing with services is that they can be performed anywhere in the world. The design companies that have come into the marketplace may be working for Chinese companies but the work they are doing is often done in Britain.” “We can see China’s transition will create huge markets...and will be one of the most important aspects of Sino-European trade co-operation over the next five to 10 years\" Chi Fulin, China Institute of Reform and Development One of the opportunities for service sector businesses, particularly in financial services, is the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, which was opened in September 2013. Authorities have said more like it would follow in other cities. Many European companies have already set up operations in Shanghai. Although some have argued about a lack of clarity on the rules, the zones offer the potential for service businesses, particularly in the financial and health care sector, to operate with fewer restrictions. Mr Day with King & Wood Mallesons also said the zones could be testing grounds for more liberal rules nationwide, adding that they “represent an economic experiment for companies”. Chi Fulin, president of the China Institute of Reform and Development, a think tank based in south China’s Hainan province, said the opening up of China’s services sector and the transitioning of its economy would be a boon for Europe. “We can see China’s transition will create huge markets… and will be one of the most important aspects of Sino-European trade co-operation over the next five to 10 years,” he said. However, economics professor Xu Bin argued that the transition was not a dramatic change, as it had been happening gradually and was natural, and therefore would not have major effect on China trading partners. “It’s misleading to separate industry and services as if they are competing,” said the academic with the China Europe International Business School. “I don’t think they can be regarded as substitutes. Many manufacturing companies such as IBM actually moved from manufacturing to services and many other companies have this mix. So there is unlikely to be this big change.” Yet Mr Day added there was a feeling in Britain that the country wanted to grasp any new opportunity and catch up in its relationship with China. “There is a sense that we could have done more to build and promote a trade relationship and that is what’s happening at the moment. There is a much greater push,” he said.
