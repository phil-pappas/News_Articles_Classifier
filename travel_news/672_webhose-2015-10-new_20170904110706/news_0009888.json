Since 1990, the country has sent more than 30,000 peacekeepers to serve overseas, including 10 who lost their lives, according to the Ministry of National Defence. “When you see that engagement from China, it means China is really concerned by the plight and the problems affecting people,” Edmond Mulet, assistant secretary-general for Peacekeeping Operations at the UN, said earlier this year. “For the UN, China’s contribution is more than important; it’s extraordinary,” he added. President Xi Jinping pledged that China would stick to multilateralism and advance the UN’s role in safeguarding peace and achieving development Emilio J Cárdenas, Argentina’s former ambassador to the UN, also wrote on China’s peacekeeping efforts in La Nació n newspaper, saying: “China’s presence on the international stage is increasingly evident. Its leading role and influence are clearly on the rise in the most diverse corners of the globe.” China has actively participated in UN peacekeeping tasks since 1990, when the country sent five military observers to the UN Truce Supervision Organisation. Since then, personnel from several divisions under the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), including soldiers and riot police, have been involved in multinational missions, such as the anti-piracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden. On 8 September 2015, China sent its 18th peacekeeping team to Liberia, this time 257 soldiers. Another team was scheduled to leave nine days later. Shortly before the deployment, President Xi Jinping pledged to the visiting UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon that China would stick to multilateralism and strengthen the role of the UN, advancing the organisation’s role in safeguarding peace and achieving development, especially in implementing the post-2015 development agenda. China is the country that has sent the most peacekeepers among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council According to UN data, 16 peacekeeping operations are ongoing on four continents. As of 30 June, the peacekeeping workforce in the field consisted of 92,299 troops and military observers, 13,095 police officers, 5,315 foreign civilian personnel, 11,476 local civilian personnel and 1,760 volunteers. Lt Col Dai Qilin, a planning officer with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, said peacekeeping has always been a key task for the UN, and for the past 25 years China has played an increasingly important role. “As we can see, China is the country that has sent the most peacekeepers among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council,” he said. He added that Chinese peacekeepers have brought strict discipline to the UN, pointing out there had been no scandals or negative feedback about their work. China sent its first guard unit to the UN mission in Mali in 2013. Previously, the country had sent mainly supportive peacekeeping forces, such as engineers, logistics specialists and medics. In a practical way, China is trying to better integrate with the world and become a guard of the international system Zhang Junshe, a senior researcher at the PLA Naval Military Studies Research Institute, said Chinese peacekeeping forces “have made a historical leap forward” by diversifying their troops and participation in various actions. The peacekeepers have “displayed China’s speed and quality in fulfilling their duties”, and have “helped to display China’s image as a major country that loves peace and is proactive in participating in UN affairs,” he said. “In a practical way, China is trying to better integrate with the world and become a guard of the international system.” China is not fighting alone, of course, as it has joined hands with peacekeepers from many other countries, while the country also puts focus on helping to improve the security situation in the mission areas. Yang Yujun, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defence, said in June that the PLA would embark on more co-operation with the US in fields such as peacekeeping, and humanitarian rescue and relief.
