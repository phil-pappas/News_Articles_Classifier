The decline was primarily due to a decrease in seat capacity by Frontier Airlines.\nMeanwhile, United Airlines’ passenger traffic increased nearly 4 percent with a nearly 3-percent capacity increase, and Southwest Airlines’ passenger traffic increased more than 13 percent with an 8-percent capacity increase. Additionally, Delta Air Lines, Spirit Airlines and American Airlines all reported passenger traffic increases during August.\nYear-to-date passenger traffic is down 0.7 percent with 35,689,101 passengers compared to 35,939,588 passengers during the same timeframe in 2014.\nDenver’s international passenger traffic decreased by 3 percent in August 2015 compared to August 2014.\nWhile international passengers using Denver’s customs facilities increased 16 percent in August, preclearance passengers from Canada decreased nearly 24 percent. Southwest Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa, Icelandair and Volaris all saw strong international passenger increases in August. Total international passenger traffic was down 2.5 percent the first eight months of 2015 compared to the same timeframe the prior year.\n“Denver International Airport is exiting the busy summer travel season on nearly the same pace with last year’s record-setting passenger traffic,” airport CEO Kim Day said. “Most of our airline partners are experiencing continued growth in capacity and passenger traffic as we near the holiday travel season. Among United’s hubs in August, Denver saw the second-largest capacity growth, while Southwest Airlines saw its sixth consecutive\nmonth of double-digit passenger traffic increases.”\nAdditionally, mail, freight and express cargo operations handled 44,310,261pounds of cargo, a 0.9-percent increase in August compared to the same month last year.
