THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE NEEDED A LITTLE BRIBERY TO GET STARTED. © Provided by Mental Floss In its initial conception, the Brooklyn Bridge had an honorable goal: Providing safe passage across the rough and frigid East River for Brooklyn residents who worked in Manhattan. In the 1850s, Prussian-born engineer John Augustus Roebling dreamed of a suspension bridge that would make the commute easier for these working class New Yorkers.\nHowever, the methods employed to get the project rolling weren’t quite as honorable. After Roebling was hired by the New York Bridge Company to help span the river, infamous political kingpin William “Boss” Tweed funneled $65,000 in bribes to city aldermen to secure funding for the bridge.\n2. THE BRIDGE HAS GONE BY SEVERAL NAMES “Brooklyn Bridge” seems like a natural handle for the hybrid suspension and cable-stayed bridge connecting lower Manhattan to its neighbor across the East River, but the name evolved over time. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle first referred to the project as the “Brooklyn Bridge” in 1867, but in its early days it was still referred to as the “ Great East River Bridge ” as well as the “ Great East River Suspension Bridge .\" At its 1883 dedication, it took on the clunky official name the “ New York and Brooklyn Bridge .” (Brooklyn wouldn’t become a part of New York City until 1898.) Brooklyn civic pride led to the name officially changing to the “Brooklyn Bridge” in 1915 .\n3. ROEBLING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR THE BRIDGE. © Provided by Mental Floss The Brooklyn Bridge was Roebling’s brainchild, but he wouldn’t live to see its completion. While making measurements for the future bridge in 1869, a ferry crushed Roebling’s foot. The engineer developed tetanus as a result of these wounds and passed away in July 1869.\n4. ROEBLING’S SON TOOK HIS PLACE AND HAD EQUALLY BAD LUCK. © Provided by Mental Floss After Roebling’s death, his son Washington Augustus Roebling stepped in as the bridge project’s chief engineer. The younger Roebling soon developed a problem of his own. To build the structure’s massive foundation, workers labored in caissons , sealed chambers that kept the riverbed dry and allowed for digging. Breathing and working deep in the caissons required compressed air , which meant workers who came up from the depths were vulnerable to “caisson disease,” better known today as the bends. In 1872, Roebling came down with this decompression sickness and was confined to bed.\n5. THE PROJECT BECAME AN EARLY FEMINIST VICTORY. © Provided by Mental Floss After Washington Roebling fell ill, a third Roebling stepped in as the de facto chief engineer of the bridge, his wife, Emily Warren Roebling . Although Emily began her tenure running orders between her husband, who was laid up in a Brooklyn Heights apartment with a view of construction, and his workers, she soon took bona fide command of the project, overseeing the design, construction, and business management of the tremendous undertaking. Emily Warren Roebling is now widely recognized as a pioneering female engineer and a driving force behind the bridge. Following her work on the bridge, Emily went on to earn a degree in law from New York University and published essays in favor of gender equality.\n6. A ROOSTER MADE THE FIRST TRIP ACROSS THE BRIDGE. © Provided by Mental Floss Technically, the rooster was tied for first. Emily Warren Roebling earned the honor of being the first human to make the trip across the historic bridge, riding proudly in a carriage a week before its official opening in front of an audience that included President Chester A. Arthur. Sitting in Emily’s lap all the while was a rooster , a symbol of good luck.\n7. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE WAS THE WORLD’S FIRST STEEL-WIRE SUSPENSION BRIDGE. © Provided by Mental Floss John Augustus Roebling himself is credited with introducing the steel-wire innovation into bridge design. The engineer proudly referred to steel as “the metal of the future.”\n8. A SNEAKY CONTRACTOR INTRODUCED LOW-QUALITY WIRE INTO THE MIX. © Provided by Mental Floss Construction materials were accumulated under the watch of John Augustus Roebling, who failed to notice that he had been swindled on his cable wire. Contractor J. Lloyd Haigh snuck a substantial amount of inferior, even faulty, wire into the mix. The flaw went unrecognized until after the wires were incorporated into the standing bridge, at which point replacing them was impossible. Instead, the construction team doubled down on its security measures, introducing far more wire than calculations deemed necessary while working desperately to keep the discovery from reaching the public. For his part, Haigh escaped prosecution for this crime, but was arrested and convicted for forgery in an unrelated case.\n9. THE BRIDGE WAS THE SITE OF A STAMPEDE SOON AFTER OPENING. © Provided by Mental Floss The Brooklyn Bridge opened to the public on May 24, 1883 and enjoyed a fairly harmonious first five days in operation. On May 30, however, disaster struck when either a woman tripping or a rumor of a pending collapse sparked a panic among the massive crowd of pedestrians crossing the bridge. The mob’s frantic race to escape the bridge resulted in the deaths of 12 people and serious injuries to 36 more.\n10. TWENTY-ONE ELEPHANTS WALKED ACROSS THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE IN 1884. © Provided by Mental Floss How do you convince one of America’s busiest cities that its newest bridge can offer safe transport to its many commuters? Elephants. Since the most common haven for trained elephants in the 1880s was a circus tent, the city called upon entrepreneurial showman P.T. Barnum to march 21 elephants across the Brooklyn Bridge in May of 1884 to show just how sturdy the span was.\n11. COMPARTMENTS IN THE BRIDGE WERE USED FOR STORING WINE. © Provided by Mental Floss If you think a nice glass of wine would be the perfect companion for a moonlit stroll across a river, this is the bridge for you. Engineers built sizeable vaults that were up to 50 feet tall into the bridge beneath its anchorages. Thanks to their cool temperatures, these granite-walled storage spaces made the perfect wine cellars, and they were rented out to the public until World War I. The company A. Smith & Co. Productions forked over $500 a month as rent for the Brooklyn-side vaults, while the liquor distributor Luyties Brothers paid a pretty $5,000 for the prime real estate beneath the Manhattan anchorage.\n12. ANOTHER COMPARTMENT WAS TURNED INTO A FALLOUT SHELTER. © Provided by Mental Floss At some point during the Cold War, one of the bridge’s compartments transformed into a survival shelter stocked with food and water rations and medical supplies. After fading into obscurity after the close of the Cold War, this fallout shelter was rediscovered in 2006 during a routine structural inspection of the bridge.\n13. NOBODY CAN FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT COLOR THE BRIDGE WAS. © Provided by Mental Floss Upon the announcement of a plan to repaint the Brooklyn Bridge in 2010, controversy erupted over the landmark’s original color. Some historians insisted that the young suspension bridge wore a proud buff color, renamed “Brooklyn Bridge Tan” for the modern makeover. (The option of “Queensborough Tan” drew groans .) On the other side of the battle, old documents and hand-colored lithographs supported the argument that the icon’s original color was “Rawlins Red,” a hue derived from the iron-oxide from the eponymous mountain town of southern Wyoming. In the end, Brooklyn Bridge Tan won out .\n14. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE STANDS WHERE GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT. © Provided by Mental Floss The Manhattan anchorage of the Brooklyn Bridge features a bronze plaque commemorating the land below as the former location of the country’s first presidential mansion. Known alternatively as the Samuel Osgood House and the Walter Franklin House, the Lower Manhattan mansion served as the home of George Washington during his first ten months as America’s Commander-in-Chief. The residence stood at the intersection of Cherry Street and Pearl Street for 85 years before its demolition in 1856 .\n15. THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE WAS THE LONGEST IN THE WORLD FOR 20 YEARS. © Provided by Mental Floss Just two years before starting work on his New York project, John Augustus Roebling made a bit of suspension bridge history with the humbly named John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge , which spanned 1,057 feet over the Ohio River between Covington, Ky. and Cincinnati. Roebling put that endeavor to shame with the Brooklyn Bridge, which bested its predecessor’s principal span by about 50 percent. Boasting a main span of 1,595 feet and a total measurement of 5,989 feet, the Brooklyn Bridge held the superlative of longest suspension bridge in the world for two decades. When it finally lost the title in 1903, its successor was none other than its fellow East River crossing the Williamsburg Bridge . The latter’s main span bested the Brooklyn Bridge’s by only four and a half feet, though its total length reached 7,308 feet.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Augustus-Roebling", "http://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/brooklynbridge.html", "http://mentalfloss.com/", "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/emily-warren-roebling-helped-save-complete-brooklyn-bridge-article-1.1083976", "http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/33/19/all_brooklynbridgepaint_2010_05_07_bk.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/10/nyregion/fyi-780359.html", "https://books.google.com/books?id=J8FwZ3PXVngC&pg=PA91&dq=may+30+1883+brooklyn+bridge+stampede+rumor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMItZuXo7LvxwIVglY-Ch1esQwE#v=onepage&q=may%2030%201883%20brooklyn%20bridge%20stampede%20rumor&f=false", "http://www.newyork.com/articles/attractions/secrets-of-the-brooklyn-bridge-43459/", "https://books.google.com/books?id=Pj6JBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT43&dq=samuel+osgood+house+1856&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCmoVChMI6bf8p97vxwIVAooNCh0v0AVN#v=onepage&q=samuel%20osgood%20house%201856&f=false", "http://www.nyc.gov/html/bkncb2/html/committees/bridge_recons.shtml", "http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/24/may-24-1883-brooklyn-bridge-opens/?_r=0", "https://books.google.com/books?id=xdCL5VWmM4MC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=brooklyn+bridge+1915+name&source=bl&ots=BQTJSlB-Og&sig=I0L7Ej-7cyaMjwjja3ZFXWCH3F4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEYQ6AEwCGoVChMI5PuEoaXvxwIVyRY-Ch1GWALy#v=onepage&q=brooklyn%20bridge%201915%20name&f=false", "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/21/nyregion/21capsule.html", "http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/infrastructure/williamsburg-bridge.shtml", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-gypsynesters/10-things-you-dont-know-a_b_5904312.html", "http://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-brooklyn-bridge", "http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jun12.html", "https://archive.org/details/completehistoryo00gree", "http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2014/05/the_story_of_roeblings_innovation_in_designing_the_brooklyn_bridge_comes_alive_at_nj_state_museum.html", "https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/exhibitions/987/The_Great_East_River_Bridge_1883-1983/set/", "http://roeblingmuseum.org/about-us/emily-warren-roebling/", "http://roeblingmuseum.org/portfolio/cincinnati-covington-bridge/", "http://www.history.com/topics/brooklyn-bridge", "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/brooklyn-bridge-brings-gullible-article-1.330399", "https://books.google.com/books?id=YkJGCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=%22the+metal+of+the+future%22+roebling&source=bl&ots=PYG8ZbhPrX&sig=tMOL5i7YQWa58466VFifp8Juklw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI3vWmnaTuxwIVSJ2ACh3zDQnq#v=onepage&q=%22the%20metal%20of%20the%20future%22%20roebling&f=false", "http://www.jamesmaherphotography.com/images/0000/0973/caissons_brooklyn_bridge_2.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:43:51.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
