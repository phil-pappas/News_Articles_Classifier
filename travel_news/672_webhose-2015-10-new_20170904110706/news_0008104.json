Victims are colorless, ageless, from every walk of life and every corner of every community. \nOctober is breast cancer awareness month. We wanted to use it as a chance to raise awareness of all cancers. Because each fight is important. Each patient is precious. \nWe asked Star-Telegram readers to share photos of their “cancer heroes” — loved ones who are battling or have battled the disease — via Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and to tag their posts with #STCancerHeroes. The responses were enthusiastic and generous, and they continued to be shared even days past our deadline. \nThe faces of those heroes create the image on the cover of Sunday’s Life & Arts — a lavender ribbon, the color that signifies awareness of cancer. On these pages, you see the individuals who earned the distinction of “hero” by their family and friends. You’ll read more about them online. \nWe encourage readers to log on, to search for these #STCancerHeroes and to continue sharing stories of their own heroes with the social-media community.  ; \nPlease note: Photos courtesy of readers. Not all of the entries included a last name, age or city of residence.
