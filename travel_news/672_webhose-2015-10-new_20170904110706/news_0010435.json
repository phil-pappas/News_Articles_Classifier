Through this initiative, Norwegian and UNICEF will help the more than two million children affected by the brutal civil war in Syria. Norwegian’s CEO, Bjørn Kjos, will also be onboard the flight to assist.\n \n“We were eager to make an effort to help the displaced children of Syria, and through our signature partnership with UNICEF it is now possible. We will provide aircraft and crew so that we can carry emergency aid and school supplies to the refugee children,” said Bjørn Kjos, CEO of Norwegian Air. “Norwegian’s employees will make contributions, and we also encourage our customers and partners to pledge their support online at www.unicef.no/fly to help prevent a lost generation of Syrian children.”\n \nRepresented in more than 190 countries, UNICEF is the world’s leading humanitarian and development agency working for the rights of children everywhere. The organization has a responsibility to give children – both in Syria and neighboring countries – temporary educational facilities and create safe areas where they can play and receive treatment for possible trauma. Our combined goal is to provide Syria’s children with what they need so that they do not become a lost generation and can one day support themselves and rebuild their communities as pillars of a new Syria. To support this effort, the Norwegian government is funding education for children – especially girls – in crisis and conflict.\n \n“The refugee children of Syria have lost everything. Therefore, with the help of our long-term partner, Norwegian Air, we can mobilize the population to fill a plane with aid that goes directly to children in need,” said UNICEF Norway’s Secretary General, Bernt G. Apeland. “Together we can make sure these children get the future they deserve and that we prevent a lost generation.”\nNorwegian and UNICEF have had a signature partnership since 2007. Norwegian supports UNICEF with campaigns and travel assistance. Norwegian’s employees support UNICEF by donating their annual Christmas present to the organization. Last year, Norwegian and UNICEF cooperated on a relief flight to Bangui in the Central African Republic, and in 2013, Norwegian donated 10 percent of its onboard water sales to UNICEF’s important work.\n \nSource:- UNICEF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:10:44.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
