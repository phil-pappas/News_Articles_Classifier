Travel scams to look out for Article By: Megan Ellis Fri, 02 Oct 2015 11:37 AM Share Your Email Credit: shutterstock.com/gpointstudio \nWhile travelling is supposed to be a relaxing affair, there are people who will try to take advantage of you. We have some scams you should look out for on your travels. \nThese scams have been detailed by Scam Detector , a website that lists over 800 of the world's most fraudulent activities. \nHere are some travel scams you should be weary ofâ€¦ \nBird poop cleaning \nThis one is quite creative. It often happens in New York or Buenos Aires. \nThe scammer squirts you with either mustard or something brown which looks like bird droppings. \nPosing as a friendly stranger, they then point out the stain to you and start wiping it for you without asking. \nMeanwhile, they are using your distraction and embarrassment to either pickpocket you themselves or have an accomplice steal whatever you've put down while trying to clean up. \nHow could you avoid this? Always be aware of physical contact and hold your bag tight in busy places, Scam Detector says. \nBird feed scam \nThis scam is particularly sneaky. It happens in places such as Bangkok's Grande Palace where there are lots of birds. \nA stranger offers you a bag of bird feed and encourages you to feed the birds. \nMany tourists accept these bags thinking they're part of the attraction. However, once the bird feed is finished, tourists are then asked for an exorbitant fee for the feed. \nA good way to avoid this is to always check before accepting an item whether it is free or whether it has a price attached. \nKey tossing \nThis scam takes advantage of politeness and occurs mostly in Europe, at sidewalk cafes and coffee shops. \nSitting at your table, you notice a passerby squeezing past your seat - and they drop their keys right by your seat. \nDoing the naturally polite thing, you bend down to get their keys. However, this is when the scammers strike. \nAn accomplice will grab your bag or belongings while you're distracted and within seconds, they're gone. \nTo avoid this, Scam Detector suggests holding your bag between your legs and putting your leg through the shoulder strap if possible. \nYou touch, you buy \nMost of us are used to the idea of \"You break, you buy\". \nHowever, some Egyptian vendors will hold you to the idea that if you touch the item, you will have to buy it. \nThey'll even cause a scene and threaten to call police if you don't pay up. \nThe best way to avoid this would be to not touch any items before you decide to buy. \nWelcoming bracelet \nThis scam occurs in many countries around the world, often at airports or popular tourist attractions. \nA child will greet you, offering you a bracelet to welcome you to the country. Most people obviously think this is a lovely gesture. \nHowever the bracelet, which is colourful and complicated-looking, is actually a double bracelet looped together. \nThis ties your hands together for a few seconds. The scammers then run away with your bags while you try to free your hands.
