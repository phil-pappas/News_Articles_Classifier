The feedback was terrific; people found value in the day. \nAdrienne Tooley, Meeting & Event Manager, Koncept Events, said, “When you’ve been in the industry a few years, you want something new and more advanced. Smart Monday and IMEX offer very high caliber, high-level speakers that are in strong touch with what’s happening in the industry.” \n“To have a whole day before the show to come in early and get education here at Smart Monday is great,” said Lanie Collins, Marketing Association & Event Manager at Nicola Wealth Management. “Since I‘m the only one in my company who does meetings, it is terrific to be surrounded by and talk to other people who just ‘get it’, and I also get credit for what I am learning towards my CMP.” \nThe first MPI morning keynote session of the week, which was sponsored by New Orleans CVB/New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, was presented by Lee Papa on “How to Live and Lead Mindfully.” \nThe second PCMA Business School at IMEX America, sponsored by Synchronicities, was presented and led by Bob Kulhan, a professor at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. It revealed how to leverage improv techniques in the office. \nGabriela Marquez, BCD Travel M&I, Mexico, “This session has really encouraged me to break from my comfort zone and prompted fresh thinking. It was also a fun way to network and the interactive nature of it helped to break the ice with fellow participants. I’ve learned to really listen, not to judge, and to take risks.” \nAssociation Focus, the exclusive event presented by ASAE and ICCA and attended by around 180 association executives, provided a broad range of valuable tailored education and peer networking opportunities. This will be followed by Association Evening, sponsored by SLS Las Vegas, at the stunning Foxtail Nightclub where invited exhibitors will join the delegates. \nThelma da Sousa of the Pacific Coast Oto Ophthalmological Society said, “This is the third year I’ve been here because there is so much you can learn. The content and range of the sessions is superb. There are so many that I want to go to that I wish there was more time.” \n1,200 buyers and suppliers are going to Site Nite North America at the new Omnia nightclub, Caesars Palace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:32:50.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
