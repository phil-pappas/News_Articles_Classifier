Most of the 108 corporate travel agency brands polled have clients deploying apps now, with a further 18 per cent intending to follow. \n\nSome features of the app include access to flight itineraries, hotel bookings and car reservations; notifications sent to a phone, table or smart watch if there are any changes to itinerary; share their itinerary with other who need to stay updated and access seat maps, alternate flight schedules, weather and other tools to guide them through their trip. \n\nThe four TripCase launches in Asia follow Sabre’s acquisition of its regional technology partner, Abacus, earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:43:24.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
