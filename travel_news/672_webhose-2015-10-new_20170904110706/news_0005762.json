This increase was primarily the result of a quadrupling of visits as both Princess Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line expanded operations in Texas.\" \nCruise Passenger and Crew Spending in Texas \nAccording to CLIA's study, cruising at Texas ports generated 1.07 million passenger and crew visits, representing 4.6 percent of all passenger and crew visits in the U.S. and marking a 19 percent increase over 2013. These visits produced $85.1 million in passenger and crew onshore spending, or nearly $80 per visit. Total passenger and crew spending in Texas increased 24 percent from 2013. \n2014 CLIA Economic Impact Analysis \nTEXAS Totals Share of the U.S. (percent) \nPassenger Embarkations 750,000 6.8 Resident Cruise Passengers 1,233,000 11.0 Total Passenger & Crew Visits 1,069,000 4.6 Direct Expenditures ($ Millions) $1,331 6.3 Total Employment Impact 22,689 6.1 Total Wage Impact ($ Millions) $1,417 7.3 \nAdditional findings from CLIA's study: \n• Cruisers embarking from Texas' two cruise ports (Galveston and Houston) totaled 750,000, accounting for 6.8 percent of embarkations at all U.S. ports \n• Tourism-related industries received approximately $569 million, or 43 percent of the cruise industry's $1.33 billion in direct spending in Texas. \n• Another $481 million, or 36 percent of the total direct spending in Texas, was spent with businesses in six additional business segments: food processors, machinery manufacturers and petroleum refiners in the manufacturing sector; and advertising agencies, insurance carriers, and management and technical consulting companies in the nonmanufacturing sector.
