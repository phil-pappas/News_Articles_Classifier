When you went up it was gorgeous and so smooth and calm and coming down was terrific. I'd do it again. I could have gone back up\" Mrs Dunham said. \nThe grandmother of 15 is a keen adventurer, jet skiing at Kinchant Dam with family, climbing the Eiffel tower in Paris, hang gliding in Tasmania and riding camels in Egypt. \nWhen she received a sky diving voucher for her 80th birthday from her daughter Debbie Rees and son-in-law she was excited to cross sky diving off her bucket list. \n\"I've never jumped in my life at all, only over high jumps,\" she said. \nShowing no fear in the plane Mrs Dunham simply relaxed during the jump, with tandem master Mark Dawes, and took in the view over Mackay Harbour and Hay Point. \n\"I wasn't scared. You are never too old to do anything. I loved it\" she said. adventure", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:32:55.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
