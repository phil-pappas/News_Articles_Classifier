Charlie Ryan , Pillow's Head of Sales explains, \"Requests for service in the greater L.A. area have surged. As we already service a portion of the area, this expansion was natural and inevitable.\" In addition to the rise of Airbnb's popularity (Airbnb guests visiting Los Angeles more than doubled between 2012 and 2013 totaling over 135,000 last year), Pillow as a brand is also gaining traction.\nCurrently, Pillow operates in the San Francisco Bay Area , Los Angeles , Seattle , and San Diego and is planning major U.S. market expansion, expecting to open in 10 U.S. cities within the next year.\nThe market expansion is accompanied by increased growth within the company and the availability of new services. Pillow recently introduced a free appraisal service – the first of its kind in the industry, which allows any homeowner to see an estimate of how much rental income they can expect from their vacation home. Pillow's proprietary algorithm, which factors in 85 different criteria including location, number of bedrooms, and amenities, is able to accurately predict both occupancy and monthly rental income. This technology means Pillow's homeowners can rest assured knowing their rental income is secured each month.\n\"We're bringing the predictability and consistency of the hotel world to the unique and heart-felt individuality of home-rentals,\" said Pillow CEO Sean Conway . \"We're here to make vacation home rental hassle-free and profitable for every homeowner.\"\nIn Hermosa Beach , for example, Pillow projects the average 2 bedroom home to make an average of $6,530 monthly. Similar homes in Beverly Hills , West Hollywood and Downtown LA draw monthly incomes averaging $5,684 , $5,307 and $4,265 , respectively.\nPillow's management team includes CEO and Co-Founder Sean Conway and COO and Co-Founder Justin Miller , who together previously founded Notehall which was sold to Chegg in June 2011.\nAbout Pillow – Pillow, the U.S.'s largest urban vacation rental manager, is a tech-driven hospitality company that offers comprehensive vacation property management from beach villas to urban penthouse apartments, and complete guest services. The company's proprietary algorithm generates maximum rental income for homeowners while removing the hassle of listing properties and hosting guests.
