South, which opened in May, is no exception. Fit servers in jeans and black T-shirts would look equally at home fly-fishing as ferrying gin cocktails; many of the patrons are clad in fleece vests and hiking boots. Three women in heels dining near us would have seemed out of place if they hadn’t been discussing whose family cabin was most remote.\nThis is exactly the crowd the restaurant hoped to attract. “We want South to be available for everybody — from families to fishermen,” said Shane Moore, the executive chef, who has been cooking in Anchorage for almost two decades.\nThe menu reflects Mr. Moore’s desire for accessibility. Dishes range from plump burgers and vodka-battered fish and chips to sopa de mar and filet mignon. During a recent visit, highlights included two Mexican-inflected small plates: cotija-smothered grilled maiz and gambas with the perfect guajillo chile kick.\nSouth doesn’t take reservations, and for us the wait was 45 minutes at 5:45 p.m. Instead of being haunted by the tourists who descend on the coastal downtown, though, the restaurant seems a decidedly local joint. (South is in South Anchorage, eight miles from downtown, far enough to keep away cruise passengers.)\n“You’re the first tourists I’ve had,” said our suspender-clad bartender, pouring tonic into my British Raj cocktail, where it combined fizzily with Tanqueray gin, curry leaves, lemon peel and star anise.\nAlso local: the ingredients. The salmon is from the Copper River. Our mussels were just as fresh as they tasted, reaching the restaurant from Homer, within 24 hours of harvest. Each week nearby farmers send lists of their inventory, and Mr. Moore sees what he can incorporate. South’s own garden features Swiss chard, kale, collards and other leafy greens.\nThe sleek, modern décor acknowledges the industrial past of the neighborhood: battered wooden pallets cradle wine bottles; exposed ducts snake along the ceiling. And if its down-to-earth aesthetic and emphasis on local ingredients aren’t enough, the mounted moose head skeleton holding court over diners like an Alaskan ambassador will remind them exactly where they are.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:05:14.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
