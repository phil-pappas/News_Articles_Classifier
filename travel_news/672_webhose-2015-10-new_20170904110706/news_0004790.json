According to the recent Global Age Watch Index, we come 27th out of 96 countries on the measure of health and well-being – despite having a nationalised health service – because our scores have been dragged down by loneliness levels. The elderly are more vulnerable to the plague of loneliness than other age groups. Around one in 10 British people over 65 say they are often or always lonely, which has severe implications on mental and physical health, as well as general wellbeing. But a new scheme, launched by a lone small business , is hoping to tackle the issue in an unusual way. Gibsons is the UK’s oldest puzzle and games company. Founded in 1919 by Henry Percy Gibson, the family business now employs the fourth generation of Gibson. Gibsons has partnered with four libraries on the initiative, supplying its puzzles and games for a nominal fee in an attempt to create a social hub “We sell a lot of our products, especially jigsaw puzzles, to elderly people,” says chairman Michael Gibson. “Most of them do the puzzles at home alone, so we decided to invest in a project to encourage people to come out and socialise.” Gibsons has partnered with four libraries on the initiative, supplying its puzzles and games for a nominal fee in an attempt to create a social hub. Heston Library in Hounslow, Bradmore Green Library in Croydon, Gayton Library in Harrow, and Ealing Central, which is due to come on board presently, are trialling the scheme. If successful, Gibsons hopes to roll out the concept across the UK. “We have very loyal customers and we feel we owe them something,” Mr Gibson explains. “We want to put something back into the community.” The scheme aims to tackle loneliness but could also benefit the libraries themselves, he adds. Many are struggling to attract new members in a digital age, where the Kindle has become hugely popular. Speaking from Heston Library, Mr Gibson admits, “It’s very quiet at the moment.” Around one in 10 British people over 65 say they are often or always lonely The scheme is particularly aimed at older women: 65pc of Gibson’s customers are female, aged over 65, and do puzzles at home. “We talk a lot about dementia and so forth and people living on their own not having social interaction being more vulnerable,” says Gibson. “We want to contribute to the solution, and see people who spend too much time alone mixing with other people.” Businesses don’t have to be huge to effect social change. Even the smallest companies can make a difference – and it doesn’t have to come at a high cost. At Timpson, the key cutter and cobbler, there is a policy of employing ex-offenders to help them start a new life after prison. The re-offending rate is practically nil across more than 20 years, compared to the UK average of 60pc. And you don’t have to run a social enterprise to champion a social cause: there are many to solve, from engaging Britain’s disenfranchised youth to tackling loneliness in the elderly. You don’t have to aim big – in fact, aiming small usually has a better likelihood of success. Is there a social issue that you could solve, in some small way?
