The resort has its own private beach where guests can enjoy water sports or go diving and marvel at glorious coral reefs, teeming with spectacular marine life.

And visitors can explore shops and venues offering the best of Jordanian traditional arts and crafts including Taybeh Village with its Nabataean pottery and the Wadi Mousa Silver Production Centre.\nGreen Globe congratulates Mövenpick Resort & Spa Tala Bay Aqaba on its recent re-certification for the fourth year running in acknowledgement of its dedication to sustainable practices.\nBeat Peter, General Manager at Mövenpick Resort & Spa Tala Bay Aqaba said, “Our successful re-certification by Green Globe is an honor that underlines our full commitment to sustainability. We have consistently aimed to improve our operations over the years. This year’s projects, for instance, included the installation of an additional 150 solar panels to increase our capacity in heating water through using natural energy, setting-up additional softener tanks to ensure durability of our equipment, completion of Phases 3 and 4 of the LED Light Project where ordinary light bulbs were replaced with LED lights, and the Pool Maintenance Programme where water leaks were repaired thereby reducing water wastage.”\nThe property uses the Hotel Optimizer management system designed by Green Globe’s preferred Middle East Partner FARNEK to record and monitor all energy and water consumption. In total there are now 400 solar panels installed that are used to partially heat water in the pools and spa. In addition, other energy saving initiatives include motion sensors which are utilized for outdoor lighting and at parking lots. Also, air conditioning units in guest rooms automatically switch off when balcony doors are open.\n“Moreover, Mövenpick Resort & Spa Tala Bay Aqaba continuously seeks ways to better protect the environment, and included in our future plans is the installation of a Variable Frequency Device to our water pumps in order to regulate fuel and energy consumption, and the RO system to save on water consumption,” added Mr. Peter.\nSource:-Movenpick Resort", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:30:55.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
