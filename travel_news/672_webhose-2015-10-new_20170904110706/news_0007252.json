Wilson \nIf you're like me, you've turned into a device addict. On any given trip, I may have an iPhone, an iPad and a MacBook Pro, depending on where I'm going. And all of those items are power hungry. \nWe’ve all been there — our laptop/smartphone/tablet is running on fumes after a flight or a long delay and we’re desperate to find that power outlet. Many a time I’ve seen people wandering an airport like the lost tribes of Israel, looking for that plug. I’ve even seen people almost come to blows over outlets. \nAirports understand this all-consuming need, so they've become much better at providing more plugs. Dallas/Fort Worth International has free Travel Lounges , where travelers can use workstations and have access to power outlets at every seat. Airports including Orlando International , JFK , and Boston Logan , to name a few, have power outlet poles throughout their terminals. Minneapolis-St. Paul , Chicago O’Hare and Chicago Midway have seated work stations with counter space and power outlets. And Boston Logan and Toronto-Pearson are among airports that have contracted with seating company Arconas to install gate seats that offer power outlets and mat charging. \nAnd the airlines are also getting into the power game. Southwest Airlines has power bars with stools and comfy club seats at most of its gates in its larger cities. Delta Air Lines has power stations that include six six 110-volt outlets and two USB ports (I've used them). Alaska Airlines has installed power outlets in more than half the seats in the gate area In Terminal 6 at Los Angeles International Airport . Virgin America’s Terminal 2 at San Francisco International Airport offers elevated worktables with power outlets. \nAnd United Airlines is the latest to join the party, announcing in March 2014 that it would install 500 power outlets, similar what Delta currently offers, at its hub and larger destination airports. \nI used to be a big user -- and contributor -- to the Air Power Wiki , which was a crowdsourced site that showed the locations of airport power outlets across the globe. It's still available, but it looks like it hasn't been updated in awhile. AirportPlugs.com appears to be trying to fill that gap. It allows users to choose an airport, location, area and details. But it's in beta testing and currently only lists six airports. \nBut if you're still on the hunt for an outlet, look in the obvious places: near vending machines, gate check-in desks, trash cans, and anywhere you think a vacuum cleaner might be used.
