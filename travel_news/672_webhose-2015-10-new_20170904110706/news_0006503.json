The hotel is like Tokyo itself - western in appearance but Japanese through and through. And this hotel is the most recent addition to eTN’s THE LIST. \neTN Publisher Juergen Steinmetz recently stayed in one of the 746 well-appointed guest rooms and when using the gym noticed the paper drinking-water cups were not falling out in bundles as they do in most gyms. Instead, you had to push a button allowing only one to be taken at a time. What a simple and excellent invention. One push at a time when taking a paper water cup A blood pressure machine as part of the gym equipment \nLooking further, the gym had a blood pressure machine, a logical and healthy addition to a gym. \nJuergen Steinmetz said, “I have stayed in a lot of hotels, many of them Hyatt hotels, and this is the first one with a blood pressure machine as part of the gym experience. \nWhat a superb idea, and I hope other hotels with busy executives working out will follow the lead of the Hyatt Regency Tokyo. \nMr. Asami Takasawa, GM of the hotel, told eTN: “Our swimming pool and fitness center are located on the 28th floor where guests can enjoy running with a breathtaking panoramic view of Shinjuku’s skyscrapers both in the daytime and nighttime. It is an ideal space for leisure and business travelers to work out and opens daily from 5:00 am to shape up, and 6:00 am for swimmers, until 9:00 pm. \n“You can find an automatic blood pressure measure machine at the entrance of our fitness area, and it is very easy to check your health conditions before and after a workout. This service, along with the complimentary mineral water, is designed to prevent health risks and enhance the joy to exercise in preferred conditions.” \nWhen eTN decided to add the Hyatt Regency Tokyo to THE LIST, Mr. Asami Takasawa said: \n\"We are very honored to be nominated to THE LIST. In the heart of Shinjuku, one of the most exciting cities in Tokyo, our hotel is an ideal location for business and leisure travelers. Hyatt Regency Tokyo promises to deliver energizing and refreshing experiences to our guests with our 746 guestrooms, 7 restaurants and bar, meeting and banquet rooms, and spa and wellness facilities, along with our distinctive service.” \nSo how does one make it on THE LIST? Anyone can nominate a hotel, destination, attraction, airline, person, cruise, or restaurant based on a best moment or experience. THE LIST is not about rating how “luxurious” something is. It is more about how much something is appreciated or different.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:47:51.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
