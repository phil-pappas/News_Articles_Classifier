The lack of qualified drivers remains a tremendous threat to continued industry growth.\"\nEven without capacity expanding, Costello said sales of Class 8 trucks should remain strong as fleets replace older trucks with newer ones.\nCostello spoke at the MCE General Session, sponsored by Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems LLC with Nariman Behravesh , chief economist at IHS Inc.\nAmerican Trucking Associations is the largest national trade association for the trucking industry. Through a federation of 50 affiliated state trucking associations and industry-related conferences and councils, ATA is the voice of the industry America depends on most to move our nation's freight.
