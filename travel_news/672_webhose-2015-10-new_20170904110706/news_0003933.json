But thinking about succession planning now, long before you need to put it into action, can really pay dividends later. The first step is to identify a successor who will be up to the task of running the business when you step down – or you may prefer to find two or three successors who will divide the roles you currently do between them. Either way, make sure you consider whether they have the right personality as well as the right level of competence to take on the job. The leader of an SME must be just as good at getting on with people and being able to form a cohesive team as they are at knowing how to sell products. Tread particularly carefully if you run a family business and do not plan to choose someone who might have assumed the job was automatically theirs. Invest time, money and energy on your successor's learning and leadership capabilities If you cannot find the people you need within the business, you will need to recruit from outside. Make it clear when you are recruiting that this is part of the plan, and hire for the position they will ultimately take on and not the one they will be initially fulfilling. Do not leave the choosing or recruiting process to the last minute because you will need to prepare your successor to take over your role by giving them the skills and expertise they will need. Be ready to invest time, money and energy developing their learning and leadership capabilities. Send them on external training courses and to other parts of the business to widen their knowledge and give them a better insight into how the business works. You should also specify a time frame for all this and, crucially, discuss your plans with your chosen successors to ensure they are also happy about the idea. Do not just assume they see your company as their career – they may have other plans. And do not just think about who will replace you when you leave the business. You should also have a succession plan in place for your key employees, because if they suddenly left your business would suffer. Identify the person or people who could take their place. Tacita Small is HR director at Ministry of Sound, a multimedia entertainment business. She says: “Many businesses look at succession planning as an exercise that is carried out once a year to evaluate top performers and map promotions for the lucky few. “However, good succession planning needs to be much more than just identifying great number twos. For succession to be successful in an organisation of any size it must live and breathe not only within the performance cycle but in the DNA of the company. “The greatest leaders know their teams inside out. They know who wants progression and who doesn’t and they know those who are able to stay the course and those who are not.” She says: “Be explicit about the growth plans for your organisation with all employees – this will help staff assess their own development goals as well as allowing less obvious candidates to step forward. “Hold regular reviews so you understand what type of progression is sought, and by whom, and ensure you have a culture of high performance and reward good work well. \"It’s also important to identify knowledge and development gaps of those that will be the successors – make these attractive to resolve and offer good training. Invest not only in those on the succession pipeline but those around them, too.” • Whatever the future holds for your business, you can help protect it with the right company car financed in the best way.
