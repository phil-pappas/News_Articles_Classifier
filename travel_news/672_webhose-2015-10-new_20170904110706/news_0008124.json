These savings are set to benefit more families from March 2016 when children under 16 will be exempt from the duty.\nThis cut follows changes to APD earlier in the year with the abolition of the more expensive long haul APD Bands C and D on 1 April. These changes have simplified the APD system and made destinations such as the Caribbean, India and China more affordable for Britons.\nMark Tanzer, ABTA Chief Executive commented: “It is great news that people are feeling the value of this reduction to APD and this cut for children has undoubtedly benefited hard working British families. We welcome the Government recognising the damaging impact this tax is having and urge them to keep it under review, especially given the announcement by the Scottish Government that it will cut APD by 50% with a view to eventually abolishing it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:52:13.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
