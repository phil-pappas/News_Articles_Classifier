What better vacation is there than an air tour at the Grand Canyon? You can take flights from Las Vegas, from nearby Boulder City, and even from Arizona in the town of Tusayan. The flights lift off every day, except for Christmas Day, so you'll find plenty of tours over Halloween. October is actually a popular time to visit the Grand Canyon, so if you plan to go, be sure to book your tour early. Grand Canyon Helicopters From Las Vegas The helicopter tours that operate out of Vegas and Boulder City in Nevada all fly to the West Rim of the Grand Canyon. The West Rim is a lot of fun because you can raft along the smooth waters of the Colorado River and walk out on the massive glass Skywalk. Of course, you'll have to take a landing tour if you want to add some fun adventures to your flight package. The West Rim is the only part of the Canyon where you can land at the top of the rim, or at the riverside below. The air tour is a lot of fun in its own right, even if you don't add on a landing adventure. Your flight gives you many scenic views, you'll even get to see the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead. The best way to see the Grand Canyon is from a chopper, and you'll have plenty of beautiful sights to see. However, if you want some adventure, then you should consider a landing tour. Landing tours travel the same route as the air-only tours, with the added bonus that you can land at the Canyon. Besides, you wouldn't want to go to the West Rim and miss your chance to stand 4000 feet above the bottom of the Canyon on the glass Skywalk. While the view from the air is amazing, you'll also be amazed at the view of the Canyon walls while floating along the Colorado River when you add on a boat tour. You can even combine different packages to make sure that you experience everything that there is to see. You can even choose a tour that comes with a fun Champagne picnic on the Canyon floor, that's a memory you won't forget. South Rim Tours While you can't take a landing tour if you go to the South Rim, that part of the Canyon has it's own perks. The first tour available will fly all the way to the North Rim of the park. This area is remote and has an air of mystery, and it's one of the less traveled areas of the Canyon. There is also a longer, 50-minute flight you could book that lets you see the national park lands over to the eastern border in addition to exploring the North Rim. The longer flight is very comprehensive and lets you see about 75 percent of the entire park. You'll see so many amazing sights that the extra cost of taking the longer tour seems very worthwhile. Deluxe Tour Helicopters Not every helicopter that flies to the Canyon is created equal, and that's why if you can, you should opt for deluxe tour tickets. The deluxe helicopter tours fly on the EcoStar 130 helicopter. The EcoStar is designed for sightseeing, so it has roomier seats with more personal space, plus the cabin is a lot quieter, in addition, the huge windscreen wraps around the front of the chopper so you have fantastic views with no obstructions to get in the way. As an added bonus, the deluxe tours that take off from Vegas depart right from the Las Vegas Strip and pick you up at your hotel in a limo. Compare that to taking a basic tour, which requires a shuttle bus ride to Boulder City where your chopper departs. Paying extra for a deluxe tour ensures you'll have the best views and the ultimate comfort and convenience on your tour. If it works for your budget, go with a deluxe tour. If not, there's still nothing else that compares to flying a basic package to the Grand Canyon. Conclusion Halloween is the perfect time to squeeze in one last vacation before the winter holidays. There are so many tour options, you'll be able to find something that's a perfect match for your interests and budget. Also, book your tour now, or it might be sold out if you wait. It's easy to shop for the right tour online, and when you buy it online, you can use the Internet discount for a nice holiday treat.
