A fortnight ago the event was postponed until early 2016 following negotiations between the venue and the International Ski Federation (FIS), however it has now been officially cancelled after organisers were unable to find a date that suited the athletes’ schedules. Snowsports fans who'd already booked tickets for the event voiced their disappointment on social media that the competition wouldn’t be going ahead. Freeze has been postponed indefinitely Photo: Â© Oliver Kraus David Hooley, who had planned on attending, commented on the Freeze Big Air Facebook page: “Gutted, was really looking forward to this.” Another disappointed ticket buyer, Denise Forbes, highlighted how it would affect the athletes: “I feel sorry for the athletes booked for it. They are probably feeling let down and annoyed.” Don't know if I'm more upset about @freezebigair being cancelled or One Direction not being able to perform last night as Liam was too ill.. — James Webb (@jameswebb13) October 21, 2015 GB Park & Pipe freestyle ski athlete Murray Buchan tweeted that he was \"disappointed\" at not getting to compete. Freeze Big Air released a statement on its website explaining why the festival has been cancelled this season. It read: “We’re very sorry to announce that we’ve been unable to find a viable date in the snow sports calendar for Freeze Big Air during winter 2015/16. We’re therefore really disappointed to confirm Freeze Big Air will not run this season, and apologise to everybody who has made arrangements for the event. “We’re grateful for the funding opportunities provided by UK Sport, Greater London Authority (GLA) and British Ski & Snowboard (BSS), and would like to thank all sponsors, ambassadors, partners and ticket buyers for their support.” Slightly disappointing! https://t.co/W6TcT5FUM0 — Murray Buchan (@murraybuchan) October 21, 2015 The organisers have said that full refunds will be processed automatically within seven days, including booking fees. Any ticketholders who have refund queries can contact See Tickets on 0871 220 0260 or Ticketmaster on 0333 321 9999, and further enquires should be sent to freeze@visionninegroup.com. • Which athletes are coming to The Telegraph Ski & Snowboard Show?
