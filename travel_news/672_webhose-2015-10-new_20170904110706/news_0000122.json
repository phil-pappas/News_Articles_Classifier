Co., Oklahoma's leading construction materials company, has deployed the Lytx DriveCam ™ Program throughout its fleet of 540 vehicles in operations across two states.\n\"At Dolese, we believe that no task is worth doing if it can't be done safely,\" said Mark Helm , chairman of the board and president of Dolese. \"Our commitment to safety led us to Lytx and their DriveCam in-vehicle technology, and since deployment we've been impressed with the results. Using these videos and paired with proper coaching, we believe that this system can help our drivers achieve an exceptionally high safety level and improve safety for our employees and the communities traveling around us. We're looking forward to a successful long-term partnership with Lytx.\"\nDolese's management led the implementation of the program in their fleet through significant engagement in preparations and specific communication to their drivers. Dolese quickly transitioned from a trial of the DriveCam Program into full deployment. Within a short time, the company leveraged the program's predictive analytics and driver coaching model to identify and improve drivers' safety, reduce traffic violations and decrease driver incidents by more than 50 percent.\n\"Dolese's early success with the Lytx DriveCam Program is a testament to their existing strong safety culture and their commitment to a successful implementation of our safety program,\" said Paul Jones , Enterprise Commercial Leader for Lytx. \"They've achieved a remarkable 73 percent driver coaching effectiveness score in the first few months and drivers are rapidly improving, reflecting their high engagement with the program. Management is rewarding improved behavior, which boosts engagement further.\"\nThe Lytx DriveCam Program combines video-based predictive analytics, driver coaching, fleet tracking and more to improve driver behaviors, protect and save lives, and reduce operational expenses.
