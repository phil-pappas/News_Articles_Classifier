Visit both McCaig’s Tower , a 19th-century monument with views across the bay, and the ruins of Dunollie Castle on the edge of town. Walk along the new path from Ganavan beach to the fascinating Ocean Explorer Centre (free). Support Oban Phoenix , the town’s recently rescued, community-owned cinema.\nHow about further afield?\nOban is the gateway to the western isles and the place to start an island-hopping holiday. There are year-round ferries to 25 inhabited islands, including Mull, Iona and Islay.\nAnywhere for dinner?\nOban Fish and Chip Shop Try fresh seafood from the stalls on the ferry pier by the harbour, or the specials at the Oban Fish & Chip Shop , such as local monkfish scampi. The renovated Waterfront Fishouse has seabass ravioli and scallops from Mull, while Ee-usk has fantastic seafood platters. Despite the name, Coast has more meaty options, including Argyll venison and East Lothian partridge.\nRelated: All aboard Scotland’s new Borders Railway\nHow about a pint?\nCuan Mor is a stylish restaurant-bar decked out with local materials, such as reclaimed timber from Oban’s lighthouse pier. It brews its own beer and stocks 100 whiskies. Aulay’s Bar is a more traditional pub with darts, dominoes and real ale.\nAnywhere to stay for under £100?\nThe Ranald opened in 2012, the first newly built hotel in Oban for decades. The 17 rooms are small but nicely designed in a modern Scottish style (doubles from £65). Aspen Lodge , a couple of miles away, is a modern B&B. Rooms have verandas with views over the glen (£85).", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/1/1443714868880/d13d1c61-de59-4429-a74f-93685679e0da-620x372.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ef445a4b4a05431ac2cd5bb4aa89b9c1", "http://www.cuanmor.co.uk/", "http://www.coastoban.co.uk/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/1/1443714868880/d13d1c61-de59-4429-a74f-93685679e0da-620x372.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=bf50696ae2f368ae0c2e3c977a3dff09", "http://www.oceanexplorercentre.org/", "http://www.discovering-distilleries.com/oban/", "http://www.eeusk.com/", "http://www.obanphoenix.com/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/1/1443714868880/d13d1c61-de59-4429-a74f-93685679e0da-620x372.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=1072146a16fe3e1318e584ffd21e7ae8", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/1/1443714868880/d13d1c61-de59-4429-a74f-93685679e0da-620x372.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=913fe28a94e783ee3a24081c7f30b2ec", "http://theranaldhotel.com/", "http://waterfrontfishouse.co.uk/", "http://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/mccaigs-tower-p255141", "http://www.aulaysbar.com/index.htm", "http://www.obanfishandchipshop.co.uk/", "http://aspenlodgeoban.co.uk/", "http://ancomunn.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-06T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:00:16.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
