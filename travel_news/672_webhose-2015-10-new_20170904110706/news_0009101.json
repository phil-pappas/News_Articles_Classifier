On Thursday (15), Cecilia Tse presided over a dinner-reception for travel trade partners, media representatives and other guests at the historical Hotel de Rome, on which facade the Macau video mapping show is being projected. At the occasion, Cecilia Tse, joined by the Festival of Lights Managing Director and Organizer Birgit Zander, held a celebration event ceremony of the Macau’s video mapping show at the facade of the landmark hotel, located in the heart of Berlin.\n“Our debut at the stunning Festival of Lights offers a great exposure as well as a learning opportunity to Macau as a tourism city. Since last year, Macau Government Tourist Office has been using this creative and impressive modern tool of video mapping to promote the city in Mainland China and abroad. At the same time, we have been testing the waters to introduce regular 3D video mapping displays in Macau as well,” Cecilia Tse remarked at the MGTO organized dinner-reception.\nThe Macau 3D video mapping show “Touching Moments” is being displayed at the 11th Festival of Lights, which opened on October 9 and closes today (October 18). Portraying in an innovative way the cultural and tourism elements of Macau via its emblematic lotus flower, the five minutes-long illumination will have a total of around 150 screenings for the ten nights of the festival. The Macau projection has been seen by the crowds of viewers attending the international festival, as the annual mega-event that turns Berlin into a city of light art displayed on its monuments and buildings, already developed into an important tourism magnet, drawing over two million visitors from Berlin, Germany, Europe and around the world.\nCecilia Tse also met with the Director for Market Management of Visit Berlin, Ralf Ostendorf, on October 13, to exchange views on tourism development, and to learn with the experience of Berlin, which has evolved as one of the fastest growing tourism cites in Europe leveraging on cultural tourism.\nIn tandem with the Macau video mapping presentation, MGTO also held other high-impact promotional activities in Berlin to maximize the exposure gained during the popular Festival of Lights. A radio campaign about Macau was running in cooperation with the German station Spreeradio, as well as a promotion on the city’s cabs touring the streets of Berlin, this one lasting until beginning of November, among other initiatives, to enhance the recognition of Macau and its attractions as a tourism destination.\nSource:- MGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:24:43.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
