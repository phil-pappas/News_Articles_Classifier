The report cites pressure from foreign exchange rates, lower surcharges in international markets and domestic yields for the decline, according to a financial report filed this morning.\n \n \nThe airline posted outstanding operational performance in September, with more than 90 percent of flights arriving on time and a 100 percent mainline completion factor.\n \n \nThe airline also reported that it expects an operating margin for the third quarter of 20 to 21 percent, with unit revenues for the quarter down 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent. Delta projected that it paid between $1.80 and $1.85 per gallon for jet fuel for the quarter, significantly less than the previous year.\n \nDelta will report its complete quarterly earnings later this month.\nSource: Delta Air Lines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T19:05:17.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
