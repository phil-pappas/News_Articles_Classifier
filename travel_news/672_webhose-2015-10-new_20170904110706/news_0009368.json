Reports say the ceiling within the building has been found to be too heavy. \nThe airport, which was due to open in 2010 before this was postponed to 2017 and then put further back, is still under construction and billions of Euros over budget. \nAuthorities say the construction firm has been ordered to stop work immediately on the area underneath the terminal roof until security checks are carried out by engineers. \nIn a statement, the airport authority said: \"There is no question we are currently in a difficult phase of the project. However we will proceed without compromise.\" \nAir Berlin, which had planned to make the airport its main hub, reached a settlement with the authorities over the delays earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:57:40.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
