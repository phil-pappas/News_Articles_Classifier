The gaping of a tubular chasm and the wiggle of a beady eye. \nThese aren’t the actions of aliens, but the movements of coral, some of the most fascinating living organisms on the planet. These marine invertebrates live in colonies made up of polyps – and their bright colours and unique formations draw divers and snorkellers to the locations in which they grow most richly, from the Coral Triangle around the Philippines and Indonesia , to the reefs of Belize and the Australian coastline. \nThe Philippines have some of the world's best corals. Photo: AP \nRead more: The world's best dive sites \nUnderwater footage gathered as part of the Catlin Seaview Survey ( catlinseaviewsurvey.com ), allows online users to explore dive sites including the Tubbataha Reefs National Park in the Philippines , a Unesco World Heritage site that has a 100-metre perpendicular wall, lagoons and two coral islands. \nMeanwhile, divers and snorkellers, as long as they proceed with caution so as not to damage the fragile ecosystem, can see some of the world's best coral reefs for themselves. The world's best dives for coral \nHere are some of the best places to admire coral reefs \nRaja Ampat, Coral Triangle \nNearly 600 species of reef-building corals and 2,000 species of reef fish inhabit the Coral Triangle, an area of Pacific ocean that includes the water around Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands. One of the best ways to see its is to take a liveaboard around Raja Ampat – the “four kings” islands of Batanta, Misool, Salawati and Waigeo. Hundreds of smaller islands sit between a reef system where divers will find 75 per cent of all the world’s know coral species. \nDive Worldwide (01962 302 087; diveworldwide.com ) has a 12-day trip to Indonesia, including a nine-night liveaboard trip to Raja Amput from £3,465 per person, including flights, accommodation, tanks and weights and transfers. \nSouth Ari Atoll, Maldives \nThe Maldives are made up of 16 main atolls – rings of reef in shallow lagoons. The dive sites around the South Ari Atoll feature plenty of thilas (underwater islands or towers) that are covered in soft corals. Himandhoo thila has red fans along with anemones and vibrantly coloured fish. Malhoss Blue Caves, meanwhile, is a dive site known for its overhanging clear blue soft corals. \nStay at the Constance Moofushi on the tip of the South Ari Atoll and dive these sites with the in-house company Blue Tribe. Double rooms start at $1,100 (£740) a night, on an all-inclusive basis (00 960 668 10 10 ; constancehotels.com/en/hotels-resorts/maldives/moofushi) . Emirates flies to Male via Dubai ( emirates.com ) \nRead more: The best Maldives hotels \nPhilippines \nThe Black Forest dive site, just off the island of Bohol, is a slope between 5m and 30m covered in multi-coloured polyps, including black coral, which is yellow and light green on the outside but black on the inside. The highlight is the end of the dive, when you can drift slowly in sun-marbled water across a fantastic coral bed that attracts shoals of brightly-coloured small fish. \nAudley Travel (01993 838 155; audleytravel.com/the-philippines/places-to-go/bohol-and-panglao-island ) has an expert in the Philippines who can arrange a tailor-made stay at Alona Beach, a dive hangout at the edge of Bohol, in the Visayas island group. \nGreat Barrier Reef \nMade up of 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands, the Unesco World Heritage Listed Great Barrier Reef off Australia draws divers for its clear, warm waters and protected fauna, which include many endemic species and corals. Hard species include brain coral, while soft corals – whose lack of a solid skeleton means they are often mistaken for plants – light up the reef in shades of mauve and pink. One of the best places to base yourself is Heron Island, where over 20 dive sites are bedecked with hard and soft corals that fizz with wildlife. Expect to see wobbegongs and reef sharks at Heron Bommie, and fan corals at Gorgonia Hole. Many of the dive sites are close to shore, and snorkelling trips can be arranged for non-divers. \nSee heronisland.com for more information. \nNosy Be, Madagascar \nLisa Grainger, a Telegraph Travel contributor, recommends diving around the small island of Nosy Be, north-west of Madagascar, for “deep and extraordinary” coral sightings. As most of the reefs are deeper than 12 metres, they suffer less from sun bleaching than elsewhere in the world, and damage from fishing is limited as locals use only lines, rather than nets or explosives. \nOriginal Diving (020 7978 0505; originaldiving.com ) offers seven nights at Tsarabanjina resort, well situated for diving around Madagascar’s northern coast, from £2,150 per person on a full board basis including international and domestic flights and transfers by boat. \nBelize \nBelize ’s 170-mile-long coral reef is the world’s second largest, bettered only by the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Beyond here, three atolls have sheer drop offs on the seaward side, and coral-rich reefs within, housing coral gardens that will make even the most terrestrial of horticulturists reconsider what makes a good garden. Three-metre purple sea fans sit alongside basket sponges; a shoal of giant grouper may wander by. Half Moon Caye and Long Caye islands also offer waters with visibility of around 70 metres, and corals in Pantone-perfect shades of yellow, red and green. \nDivequest Diving Holidays (0 1254 826322; divequest-diving-holidays.co.uk ) offers seven nights at Turneffe Island Resort from £2,137 per person, including five days of diving, full-board accommodation and transfers, but excluding flights. \nMozambique \nThe Baixo do Pinda Peninsula stretches into the Indian Ocean, and here divers will find some 15km of wall dives, where corals fan out into the ocean and fish shimmer between multi-coloured growths. Snorkellers will find coral bommies and plains of seagrass nearer the shore. Lisa Grainger says that the owners of Nuarro Lodge found the diving here “so incredible they stayed and opened a diving lodge so other people could experience it.” \nOriginal Diving (020 7978 0505; originaldiving.com ) has seven nights at Nuarro Eco Lodge from £3,775 per person on a full board basis including return flights from London via Johannesburg to Nampula, private transfers, kayaking and mountain biking. \nThe Turbinaria coral that will be on display at the Natural History Museum. Photo: Natural History Musuem London \nNorth Emma Reef, Papua New Guinea \nAndrew Purvis, Telegraph Travel deputy editor, described North Emma reef in Papua New Guinea as his best ever dive . “Swimming the length of the main reef wall, clinging to the precipice like wingsuit flyers soaring along a cliff, we headed for a coral saddle 130ft down,\" he said. \"The water was the clearest I have seen, the visibility exceeding 120ft, inducing vertigo. On the deep saddle was a forest of gorgonian sea fans, like giant golden ferns, next to a colony of feathery crinoids, or sea lilies.” Getting to Papua New Guinea is certainly no mean feat – count on at least 30 hours of travel time from London – but it is an experienced diver’s trip of a lifetime. \nOriginal Diving (020 7978 0505; originaldiving.com ) can arrange a 13-day trip to Papua New Guinea from £3,950 per person, based on two sharing. The price includes five nights at Tawali in Milne Bay and five nights at Walindi Plantation Resort in Kimbe Bay (both full-board), three dives per day including equipment rental, return flights from London, internal flights and transfers. Singapore Airlines (0844 800 2380; singaporeair.com ) flies five times daily from Britain to Singapore. Air Niugini ( airniugini.com.pg ) has flights from there to Port Moresby and to other Papua New Guinea destinations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:49:11.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
