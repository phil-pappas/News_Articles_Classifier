She remembers well how her parents performed a rite asking Mae Phosop (the Mother of Rice) to provide a healthy yield when the rice plants start growing. \nShe has always helped farmers in Sai Noi village, where she's lived all her life, to perform the rite known as tham khwan khao (blessing rice plants). \n\"Today is the auspicious day. Mother is pregnant so we bring offerings with plenty of food and desserts,\" Thongdee said out loud, for farmer Benja Nanthasen, 62, and other people who joined the rite to repeat. Between her palms, Thongdee held nine incense sticks and a small bunch of flowers. She sat on a mat facing Benja's 10 rai rice paddy. \n\"Mother please take the offerings. Other angels and guardians in this place please also accept our offer. Please protect our rice plants from bugs and diseases and give us heavy loads for harvesting,\" she said as part of her prosperous wishes for the farmer. After finishing, Benja took bits of every offering, including fruits, cooked rice, side dishes, sweets, a rolled betel vine leaf, betel nut and fine-cut tobacco and put them in a small woven bamboo container called a chalom . \nShe bound the container to a woven bamboo sheet, which was tied at almost the top of a long stick, and decorated with small paper flags. Then she tied a shocking pink ribbon below the bamboo sheet and stuck the stick, complete with the offerings, in the rice field. She took out a comb and used it on the rice leaves. Acting like she was combing the long hair of Mother of Rice, she slowly dropped nam op (Thai perfume) to the leaves and applied baby powder to the leaves. \nShe repeated the process at a couple of points in the field, while saying: \"Be healthy and beautiful, Mother of Rice.\" \nThe rite ended and the offerings are left in the field until the harvest time. \nStudents perform muay Thai. \nWhen asked whether she would apply insecticides and chemical fertilisers later on, Benja nodded and said yes. \"What should be done, must be done. The ritual is a tradition and I feel blessed every time I make the offering,\" she said. \nThe offering ceremony is common practice for farmers in Sai Noi and if you visit the village during rice flowering, you will likely have a chance to witness the ceremony thanks to the joint efforts of the Institute for Small and Medium Enterprises Development (ISMED) and the Department of Tourism (DoT), which gives guidelines to improve the homestay programme. \nSai Noi village joined the tourism bandwagon by offering homestay services about seven years ago when retired teacher Mayuree Srinak wanted to promote the simple lives of farmers to travellers who visited the old town of Ayutthaya. \n\"I founded a homestay project in Angthong when I taught in a school there 20 years ago and became the school director before taking early retirement. After returning home, I brought the experiences to promote my hometown,\" she said. \nShe worked with the village head to initially launch a homestay in her village. Starting with four houses, the project has expanded to 15 homes today. \nThose who stay in Sai Noi will also have a chance to make Thai desserts that can be traced back to the Ayutthaya period, such as foi thong (sweet golden threads), thong yib (sweet golden egg yolk bundles) and thong yod (sweet golden egg yolk drops). The highlight is foi ngoen (sweet silver threads) which is made of egg white instead of egg yolk and drizzled with boiling sugar syrup. \n\"You can find foi ngen only in Sai Noi,\" said Mayuree, who, as a community enterprise, produced those traditional desserts in her house. \nDuring my recent visit to meet with staff of ISMED and DoT, Mayuree and her team cooked foi nak . The sweet delicacy was made of egg white with a couple of drops of red food colouring. We shared the samples, but I preferred foi ngen , as its texture was chewier than the others. \nIn addition to the sweet workshop, Sai Noi homestay also provides bicycles for visitors to tour around their village. Attractions include corn fields where visitors have a chance to help farmers pick ripe sweetcorn from the crops. Visitors can also drop by the temples and houses of families that make handmade bricks, woven fish crafts and foot massage tools made from coconut shells. \nStudents also host various performances during a homestay. Based on Ayutthaya history, the show features muay Thai , sword fights and sword dances. Visitors can ask to see the performance while having dinner or at the bushy area believed to be the location for the village's three old temples. \nAt night, fireflies show up around the 9 rai lotus pond. Although only a short drive from Bangkok, Sai Noi seems like another world away. \n\"We want our village to be a destination of choice for those who'd like to experience simple rural culture and the life of farmers, while still having a chance to explore the world heritage sites in Ayutthaya,\" said Mayuree. \nA large dinner set with local vegetables. \nFoi ngoen, left, with other sweets. \nThongdee Krailert with the offerings.   0 people liked / 0  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:02:01.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
