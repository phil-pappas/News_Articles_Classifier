These days it's seen as one of the happiest countries in Europe. Here are just some of the reasons Finns have to be cheerful. Hide Caption 1 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Pyha Luosto National Park – Finnish photographer Tea Karvinen took this image of the frozen Pyha Luosto National Park. She includes it in her list of the 10 most beautiful Finnish landscapes for the VisitFinland.com website . The photo, taken in December from the highest peak in the Pyha mountains, shows the last rays of light hitting Luosto Mountain as fog descends into the valley below. Hide Caption 2 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Plenty of room – Koli's tree-covered landscape makes it a popular hiking destination in the fall, when the leaves change colors. This view by Karvinen shows the vista from Makravaara peak, above Lake Pielisjarvi, in western Finland. Hide Caption 3 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Uto Island – Finland's southernmost inhabited island is only reachable by a five-hour ferry journey across the Baltic Sea. About 50 people live on the island year round, but the population triples with the summer arrival of tourists. This image was taken by Karvinen in January. Hide Caption 4 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Great water – Repovesi National Park is a popular escape from Helsinki, just a few hours away by car. Its forests are dotted with lakes, hills and cliffs. Karvinen took this photo from atop the near-perpendicular Olhava cliffs. Hide Caption 5 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Pallas Yllastrunturi National Park – \"It was still quiet at the top of the Yllas ski resort on a Sunday morning in the middle of February when this amazing view from the top of Yllas Mountain appeared,\" Tea Karvinen writes on VisitFinland.com. Located in Lapland, Pallas-Yllastunturi is Finland's third largest national park. Hide Caption 6 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Oulanka National Park – In Kuusamo in central Finland, Oulanka National Park is known for dramatic rivers and waterfalls. Among them is the Myllykoski rapids, photographed here in January by Karvinen. It's another to make her top 10 Finnish landscapes list. Hide Caption 7 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Aland – The islands of the beautiful Aland archipelago, at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia, belong to Finland, but are home to a Swedish-speaking population. It's said to be the sunniest place in northern Europe. Karvinen includes the islands in her top 10 beautiful landscapes lists. Hide Caption 8 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Great white way – The trees of the Riisitunturi National Park make for dramatic scenery in winter when temperatures well below freezing leaves them coated in condensed frost. The area is popular with cross-country skiers, birdwatchers and photographers. Hide Caption 9 of 10 10 photos: Finland's reasons to be happy Warm welcome – If appreciating the Finnish landscape isn't enough to lift spirits, there's always the national pastime of taking saunas. Sitting in a hot, steam-filled room and gently thrashing birch twigs against the skin is seen as a healthy way to relax and bond with others. Hide Caption 10 of 10 (CNN) Premiering in 1968 and still running today, the CBS news program \"60 Minutes\" is, by most measures, the most successful show in American TV history. When the program featured a segment in 1993 called \" Tango Finlandia ,\" (watch it below) it brought to the attention of millions of Americans a certain Nordic nation about which they knew little. And what did the United States of America discover? Correspondent Morley Safer and his team revealed Finland to be a place where \"melancholy, sorrow and shyness abound.\" They also revealed \"no one looks anyone in the eye\" because \"to be noticed is an embarrassment, to take notice an affront.\" Read More Finns themselves were \"grimly in touch with no one but themselves,\" they added, concluding: \"It's no surprise that Finland has one of the lowest birthrates and one of the highest suicide rates.\" On a lighter note, the Finns loved to tango, hence the segment name. Skip forward two decades. Now Finland -- grimly-in-touch-with-no-one-but-themselves Finland -- finds itself atop the Happiness Equality Index Europe 2015 report. Similar surveys also identify it as the happiest nation on the continent. This leads to questions. Were Finns really that miserable back then? And are Finns really that happy right now? Krista Huhtala-jenks, a senior officer from Finland's Ministry of Transport and Communications, is perfectly qualified to view Finland as both a Finn (she's a native) and an outsider (she moved abroad at 18 before returning at 29). A different world In Finland, cold comfort depends on your point of view. If the Finns featured in \"Tango Finlandia\" seemed grim, Huhtala-jenks says they had reason to be that way. The Finland of the 1990s was \"quite a different world,\" she says. \"Finland was under Soviet 'influence' for a very long time and the collapse of the Soviet Union had only happened a few years back.\" Throw in high alcohol consumption, troubling suicide rates and a national economic depression and it was \"no wonder people weren't too happy.\" But does the Land of a Thousand Lakes (despite the nickname, it's closer to a land of nearly 200,000 lakes) remain a place where sorrow abounds? \"I don't think it's true.\" Conceding, \"we're still not great in small talk,\" Huhtala-jenks insists that doesn't mean \"we're extremely shy, overtly depressed or melancholic.\" She acknowledges Finns can seem despondent to outsiders, which she blames largely on a few missing words. Huhtala-jenks's husband is Irish. When they first started dating, she would \"drive him nuts as I wouldn't use the words 'please' or 'excuse me'. He'd find it extremely rude.\" Luckily, she has an excellent excuse: Finns don't have those words. \"Those words simply don't exist in our language and hence using them does not come naturally.\" Sunshine and darkness Nights like this make everything better. Her husband also committed a cultural faux pas. Huhtala-jenks was annoyed when he started talking before she finished. \"For Finns, it is extremely rude to interrupt someone. This leads to us making pauses or taking our time to talk.\" Thus foreigners may interpret this basic display of Finnish silence/politeness as being \"shy or rude or even depressed.\" To summarize: for many nationalities a conversation where no one says \"please\" and there are long pauses is troubling; in Finland it's par for the course. Which isn't to say everything's sunshine. \"We're currently in one of our worst recessions,\" Huhtala-jenks says, noting the suicide rate remains high and the heavy drinking can still be worrying. Beyond this, there are aspects of Finnish life in general that can be described as bleak. A recent Finnish National Gallery's exhibition \" The Magic North \" on late 19th/early 20th century Finnish/Norwegian art had a heavy emphasis on the dark (parts of Finland experience 24 hours of it daily in the winter), the cold (temperatures can drop as low as -50 degrees Celsius/-58 Fahrenheit) and artists like Hugo Simberg, responsible for such cheerful masterworks as \"The Wounded Angel\" and \"The Garden of Death.\" Beyond this, Huhtala-jenks acknowledges some Finns still \"will never say 'hi' or look you in the eye,\" though she contends many others are \"overtly chatty, friendly and open.\" Heavy metal happiness Of course, the most important question still needs to be answered: What about the tango? Thankfully, that's correct, both then and now. \"It is still popular in Finland: every year a tango king and queen are chosen.\" It has, however, been surpassed by another form of music outsiders might not expect. Recent visitors to Helsinki would've spotted scores of posters for a appearance by the legendary English rock band Motorhead. It's no surprise the city offers a warm welcome to Lemmy Kilmister. \"Finland is the heavy metal capital of the world,\" Huhtala-jenks declares, which is true by her definition of \" most metal bands per inhabitant .\" She credits this for some of the nation's improved spirits. \"You'd think this makes us depressed and gloomy, but the latest studies show that metal heads are some of the calmest and happiest people.\" Huhtala-jenks should know -- she proudly describes herself as \"a complete metal head.\" Brush up on your Black Sabbath albums and return for an update ASAP, Mr. Safer.
