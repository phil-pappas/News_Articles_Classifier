They are now both under the leadership of Bongani Tembe, the tenured CEO and artistic director of the KwaZulu-Natal orchestra and the newly appointed director of the JPO.\n\"I am delighted that the JPO and the KZN Philharmonic will, for the first time in their existences, make music together,\" said Tembe. \"It is true that there is strength in unity. This historic concert will also serve to affirm both orchestras’ commitment to delivering artistic excellence to the audiences of SA.\"\nThe concerts, on Wednesday and Thursday, will explore the music of two Viennese composers, Mozart and Mahler. They will begin with one of Mozart’s most famous works, the Concert for Clarinet in A Major, made instantly recognisable after being used in the film Out of Africa, starring Robert Redford and Meryl Streep. The clarinet will be played by KwaZulu-Natal Philharmonic principal clarinettist Junnan Sun.\nOther pieces include Mahler’s Symphony No 5 in C Sharp Major, also known as Mahler Five. All will be conducted by Daniel Raiskin, who grew up in St Petersburg, Russia, and studied in Amsterdam and Freiburg. Since 2005 Raiskin has been the chief conductor of the Staatsorchestra Rheinishche Philharmonie in Koblenz, Germany. Since 2008 he has held the same title with the Artur Rubinstein Philharmonic Orchestra, Lodz, Poland.\nHighlights of Tembe’s career in music and the arts include being SA’s first professional opera singer, who appeared first on an international stage in 1987, and having produced a successful European tour in 2004 to commemorate SA’s 10th year of democracy. He is a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation’s Scientific Committee on Arts Education.\n• Linder Auditorium, University of the Witwatersrand Parktown Campus, October 28 and 29 at 8pm.
