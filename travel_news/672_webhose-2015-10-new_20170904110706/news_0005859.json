Connections will be made via San Juan's Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU), where JetBlue is the largest carrier. \nCustomers flying on JetBlue and Seaborne will enjoy the benefit of traveling on a single ticket which allows for one-stop check-in, baggage transfer to the final destination, and conveniently timed connections in San Juan. Flights are available for purchase today on JetBlue.com. \n\"This latest codeshare agreement combines Seaborne Airlines' experience serving exciting Caribbean destinations with JetBlue's established footing as an award-winning carrier to the region,\" said Scott Laurence, senior vice president, airline planning at JetBlue. \nInitially, JetBlue will place its 'B6' designator code on eight Seaborne Airlines routes allowing JetBlue customers to reach more destinations in the Caribbean on a single itinerary: \n• Anguilla (AXA) • Tortola, British Virgin Islands (EIS) • Dominica (DOM) • St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands (STT) • St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (STX) \nFollowing receipt of all necessary government approvals, JetBlue will place the 'B6' designator code on the remainder of the Seaborne Airlines network to include: \n• Antigua (ANU) • La Romana, Dominican Republic (LRM) • Point-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe (PTP) • Punta Cana, Dominican Republic (PUJ) • Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (SDQ) \n\"The entire Seaborne Airlines team is excited to begin our codeshare relationship with JetBlue,\" said Gary Foss, President and CEO of Seaborne Airlines. \"I'm confident that our customers, Caribbean residents, and tourism to our region will all benefit as a result of this agreement.\" \nThe routes add to JetBlue's already extensive list of destinations in the Caribbean and Latin America including Grenada, Curacao, Antigua and Mexico City, which were all added to the JetBlue route map in the past year. Additionally, flights to Quito, Ecuador begin in February 2016. \nThe partnership between JetBlue, a leading carrier to the Caribbean, and Seaborne Airlines, the largest regional operator in the Caribbean, expands upon the carriers' successful interline agreement established in 2013.
