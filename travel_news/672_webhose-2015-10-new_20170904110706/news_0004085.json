The programs TechPro 2 , Agri Training, First Robotics and Comau Academy are all designed to provide young people with trade skills and knowledge to prepare them for future careers in the automotive and industrial machinery sectors.\nProfessors, students and FCA and CNH Industrial representatives are on hand to explain the particulars of the different programs and in some cases show the public exactly what they are all about. For instance, a live demonstration of the TechPro 2 program will see a group of young students hard at work assembling and disassembling part of an engine from CNH Industrial's Powertrain brand FPT Industrial.\nAs part of the day's activities, the public are invited to engage with FCA and CNH Industrial through social media with the hashtag #FCACNHI4EXPO. Those who participated will be asked to take a selfie with the New Holland Agriculture (an agricultural machinery brand of CNH Industrial) methane tractor on the roof of New Holland's Sustainable Farm Pavilion and a Fiat 500e and a Fiat 500L under the shadow of a big daisy. Photos are being snapped through the day are shared on the companies' social accounts.\nThe projects participating in this initiative are promoted by various Departments of FCA and CNH Industrial, involving young people and students all over the world.\nMopar – brand for the services, the Customer Care, genuine parts and accessories for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles – is at the forefront of training project TechPro 2 established in 2008 from the collaboration of FCA and the CNOS-FAP Federation (The National Centre for Salesian Projects – Professional Training). In 2011, CNH Industrial also became involved with the initiative, introducing a program specifically dedicated to commercial vehicles. TechPro 2 has established collaborations with more than 50 schools in many countries that include Italy , Spain , Poland , Ethiopia , India , Brazil , South Africa , China and Argentina .\nThe first Agri Training Centre was opened in Bhubaneswar, India in 2012 by CNH Industrial brand New Holland Agriculture in association with the Department of Agriculture of the Government of the state of Odisha. The training center aims to provide young farmers and unemployed people with the specific skills necessary to find suitable employment in mechanized agricultural farming. The course covers tractor maintenance and the overhauling of the main tractor sub-assemblies, as well as repair and maintenance of other mechanized farming equipment. For the specialized training provided by New Holland, the Agri Training Centre is equipped with special tools, such as engines and transmissions.\nFIRST Robotics was created in 1989 to reach out to and inspire high school students to explore and pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. By encouraging interest in these critical fields at a young age, FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is helping develop the technical skills necessary for the workforce of the future. The FIRST family of programs has grown to include FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC, grades 7-12) as well as FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC, grades 9-12). Seventy-one FCA US employees volunteered more than 2,000 hours as team mentors and coaches. They also supported regional and district FIRST events as competition coordinators and event volunteers. Guided by professional mentors, teams have six weeks to design, build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors. Through this process, students learn basic physics, electrical and mechanical engineering and machining skills. More than 1,000 students benefited from these programs.\nAs the demand for skilled professionals grows, Comau in collaboration with Turin Polytechnic and funded by the Region of Piedmont, has organized, a Masters in Industrial Automation to train graduates for a role within the Italian manufacturing industry. The two-year post graduate program objective is to attract the best graduates in engineering from Italian and foreign universities. These students will be provided specialized training in industrial automation to prepare them for a two-year advanced apprenticeship with the Group.\nFollow CNH Industrial:\nLinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/company/cnh\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/CNHIndustrial\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CNHIndustrial\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCNHINDUSTRIAL\nFollow FCA:\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/fcagroup\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FCAFiatChryslerAutomobiles\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/fcagroup\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/fcagroup\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.
