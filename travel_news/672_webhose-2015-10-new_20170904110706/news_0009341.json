Located around 90 miles from Buffalo and only about 10 miles west of Toronto, this picturesque waterfront village is far removed from the hustle and bustle of the big city.\nThe village, which today boasts the largest freshwater marina in Canada, is in an area that was once used by the Mississauga Indians for hunting and camping before European settlement began in the 1700s. The farmlands along the Credit River attracted many 19th century settlers. The portion of town known as Old Port Credit Village was designated a Heritage Conservation District in 2005, with many buildings retaining their early 19th and 20th century architecture. A walking tour brochure can be downloaded from www.heritagemississauga.com\nThe most prominent structure in the village is the red and white lighthouse located along the Credit River, right by the Port Credit village marina. This working lighthouse was built in 1991 to replace an original lighthouse that was destroyed by fire in 1936. Boaters can see the light from 15 miles out on the lake. The deck of the lighthouse has a great view of the harbor area and the Credit River. The offices of the Port Credit Business Association are located in the base of the lighthouse.\nWe took a stroll around the marina and walked along a portion of the Waterfront Trial, which is popular for walking, bicycling and rollerblading. This trail is part of a much longer trail that runs along the Canadian shore of Lake Ontario. (www.waterfronttrail.org)\nAfter enjoying the waterfront views of the harbor, river and Lake Ontario, we headed to Lakeshore Road, the main street in town, to explore some of the many businesses located there. With more than 400 businesses and services located along the street, it is known as one of the most successful main streets in North America. More than 50 restaurants varying from casual to upscale are mixed in with a number of clothing boutiques and jewelry stores.\nOne of the first things I noticed as we began walking around the village and marina were knitted and crocheted pieces attached to fences, trees, walls and other places. I had never seen anything quite like this before. When I went into one of the clothing boutiques, I asked the shopkeeper about the yarn items.\n“Oh, those are yarn bombs; lots of places have those,” she said. When I said I had never seen anything like this, she explained that they are an informal public art display that people just enjoy doing for fun. She said that Port Credit’s display was started by a group of local people as an extension of the bicycle planter display that was done in 2010 to commemorate Port Credit’s 175th anniversary. That explained the bicycle planter I saw covered with yarn decorations down by the marina.\nSince it was a Saturday morning, we stopped to peruse the items at the farmers market, which is held Saturday mornings from June to October. There were a variety of items for sale, including fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, gourmet foods, baked goods, honey, maple syrup, plants, trees and more.\nBy now it was lunchtime and we were getting hungry. We had many choices to consider. We decided on the Snug Harbour Seafood Bar and Grill, which seemed to be the place to eat in town judging by the number of people there. It’s a large restaurant with a wraparound patio with a great view of the marina and the Credit River. The food was good, too.\nPort Credit also has a brewery, Old Credit Brewing Company (www.oldcreditbrewing.com) which makes Amber Ale and Pale Pilsner in small batches without preservatives. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the opportunity to check it out. Maybe next time.\nSpeaking of next time, we could even stay overnight in Port Credit at the Waterside Inn, a 93-room boutique hotel that overlooks the water. According to the website, the rooms feature hardwood floors with Persian carpets, marble baths and European linens. Most of the rooms have balconies. There is also an upscale restaurant in the hotel (watersideinn.ca).\nIf you go\nFor more information about Port Credit, visit portcredit.com.\nFor information about Mississauga, visit discovermississauga.ca\nDirections\nFrom the Buffalo area, cross over one of the three bridges to Canada (remember to bring your passport or enhanced license).
