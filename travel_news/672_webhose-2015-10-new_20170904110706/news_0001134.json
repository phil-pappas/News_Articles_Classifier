If you are in the affected area or are concerned about someone who is, you should follow local advice or call the British Embassy in Mexico City on (0052) 55 1670 3200. British Nationals in Mexico are advised to view the British Embassy’s Facebook and Twitter pages for regular updates on Hurricane Patricia. \nYou can monitor the progress of approaching storms on the website of the US National Hurricane Centre . The hurricane is forecast to bring hazardous sea and weather conditions to parts of the west coast from around 23 October 2015. \nThe hurricane season normally runs from June to November and affects both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. \nProtests have affected Mexico City and other parts of the country. You should avoid demonstrations and follow the advice of the local authorities if you’re in an area where a protest is taking place. Illegal roadblocks have been reported more frequently, particularly in the state of Guerrero. If you’re driving in Guerrero, travel during daylight hours and use toll roads, although you may still encounter disruptions. If possible, travel by air if you’re visiting a major tourist destination in Guerrero. \n424,860 British nationals visited Mexico in 2014. Most visits are trouble-free. \nThe security situation can pose a risk for foreigners. Be alert to the existence of street crime as well as more serious violent crime like robbery, assault and vehicle hijacking. In certain parts of Mexico you should take particular care to avoid being caught up in drug related violence between criminal groups.
