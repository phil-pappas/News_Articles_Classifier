His latest exhibit, created in partnership with photographer Iveta Butler, is called “Charleston: One City, One Soul,” and will be on view for free at the Charleston County Library Main Branch, 68 Calhoun St., until Oct. 22. The project captures people the two photographers met by chance around town over the past 15 months. Cunningham spoke with the Charleston Scene this week about his work and the new photographs he’s displaying. Q: Tell us a bit about your background as a photographer in Charleston. A: I am more known as a heritage photographer, one who has touted black-and-white film, or so I tell myself. As photography instructor with the Charleston Center for Photography and Redux Contemporary Art Center, I taught darkroom. With CunningFox Photo Education, my focus is on the power of black-and-white film, and its continued value as an expressive medium. Q: What’s your signature style? A: I evolved from Navy photojournalism, marketing, studio (photography) and weddings. I love symbolism in color. My photo partner, Iveta Butler, strongly urged me to step up and out of the darkroom shadows. She reignited my roots in photojournalism. I connect better with people now. I think my collaborative work with Iveta shows that. Like me, film media is not perfect, but it is “hands-on,” and meditative. Use your best judgment and hope for the best, just like life. Q: How did you find your niche? A: It hasn’t been easy. I love the idea of being close to people, but I am a shy curmudgeon, with a slightly “off” sense of humor. The camera has been my bridge for 45 years. I love the people I see through it, during and after the shoot. They always touch me. I embraced digital, but film (black and white) really shows humanity. Q: What’s the general theme of your new show? A: We believe that Charleston people, no matter race, religion, culture, economics and gender, have much more in common than they realize. Iveta and I desired to illustrate the commonality through black-and-white photography. We also call the exhibit “Unity In Black and White.” The 100 people we photographed gave us a bit of themselves, also, with the statements they made about their lives. Q: What made you want to plant your roots in the Lowcountry, as an artist? A: I owe my roots in Charleston to the U.S. Navy. You could say my ship docked here and never left. Then I married a woman from North Charleston, which solidified the deal 22 years ago. I did not think of myself as an artist then, and I am not certain of that label now. I admit to being a photographer, certainly. Hopefully, I’ll continue with work here that will allow the “artist” label to stick.
