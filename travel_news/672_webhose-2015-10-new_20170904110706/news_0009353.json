She tells WFXT-TV in Boston that after she left the plane early Monday at Washington's Dulles Airport, she asked a woman at the counter where she could pump. \nCooper says the woman told her she could use the bathroom, which Cooper rejected as unsanitary. Cooper says the woman then suggested the pet relief area. \nA spokesman for Dulles says the airport does not have dedicated nursing areas but is working to develop such lounges. \nA spokesman for United says the airline will reach out to Cooper to apologize for not providing \"more suitable accommodations.\" \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
