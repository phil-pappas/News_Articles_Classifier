This is my third time on the list. I have a third, a second and now first,\" said an \"ecstatic\" Leboe, 42, by phone from Calgary. \n\"The whole thing is three spots in seven years. All in Calgary too, which is a testament to the city. \n\"The city has grown so much in the last eight years in terms of the food culture. It's pretty impressive to watch.\" \nModel Milk, of which he is also chef and co-owner, was second in 2012, and the now-shuttered Rush, where he was chef before he left to open Model Milk, placed third on the list in 2009. \nVancouver's AnnaLena, helmed by chef Michael Robbins -- who incorporates his own Lego constructions into the otherwise minimalist decor -- took this year's people's choice award on eatandvote.com. \nWinners will be profiled in the November issue of enRoute magazine and receive their awards Nov. 12 in Toronto. \nFind the top 10 new restaurants in Canada in the photo gallery above.
