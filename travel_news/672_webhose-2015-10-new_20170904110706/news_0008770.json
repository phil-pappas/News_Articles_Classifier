Company News Glencore (LON:GLEN) – 121.5 pence Mkt Cap 17.5bn – Glencore cuts lead and zinc production to return markets to deficit next year • Glencore is acting like a responsible and financially disciplined mining company by cutting back on loss making and unproductive operations. • The company is leading the way in reacting to lower LME prices and lower demand out of China and suspect other players will follow Glencore's lead in cutting back production to rebalance the market • Glencore is planning to cut its production by 5 tpa representing more than a third of the company's production. • The cut takes 3.7% out of global forecast mine production of around 13.5mtpa. • The move will cut around 1 t of zinc out of Glencore's Q4 production representing around 2.2% (4.5mtpa) • The cuts are spread between its operations in Australia Peru and Kazakhstan and could result in around 1600 jobs lost • Given the polymetallic nature of respective deposits production of lead and some other by-products will also reduce with some 1 tpa of lead to be cut. • The cuts should ensure that Glencore's zinc operations remain sustainable well into the future. • If it is any consolation to those affected we suspect Glencore will ramp up many operations again when lead and zinc prices recover. Conclusion:  We like Glencore's strategy of reacting to lower prices through the cutting of production.  The industry would do well to follow Glencore's leadership and cut back higher-cost production to rebalance these markets and return the supply / demand balance to deficit next year. The Zinc cut would turn the market to deficit based on our previous estimates for demand.  New lower demand assumptions combined with some recent inventory building to 750000t in LME & SHFE might will delay the point at which the zinc market turns by a few weeks / months.  Official Zinc inventories are not high representing just three weeks of global demand indicating the market could turn around relatively quickly. Lead inventories have fallen to 170000t from 290000t (LME & SHFE) at the beginning of the year representing just one week of global demand suggesting this cutback could have a more immediate impact on the market. The visibility of these cuts combined with other intended or unintended cuts could restart consumer stock building and turn prices higher sooner than might be expected Botswana Diamonds (LON:BOD) 0.825 pence Mkt Cap 1.7m – New prospecting licence in Botswana • The company has announced that a new 3 year exploration licence totalling 25 sq km in the Orapa region of Botswana has been awarded to Sunland Minerals the 50:50 joint-venture between Botswana Diamonds and the Russian diamond major Alrosa. • The licence covers an area with three known kimberlite occurrences known as AK2122 and 23 and is in an area considered 'the highest priority for the BOD/Alrosa joint venture.' • The company recently announced that the joint-venture had completed a three-hole drilling programme on its PL 210 licence located northeast of the de Beers mine at Damtshaa which had intersected 'intensively altered ultramafic rock' underlying geophysical and soil anomalies identified by Alrosa. The drill cores contain kimberlite indicator minerals and further detailed work is underway in St Petersburg to assess the significance of the results. Golden Saint Resources (LON:GSR) 0.385 pence Mkt Cap 2.1m – Golden Saint crowd-funding convertible • Golden Saint have launched a bid to secure funds through a crowd funding platform Crowd for Angels (UK) Limited. • The company are issuing 250000 worth of convertible notes at an 8% coupon.  The notes are convertible at a 20% discount to the average price 10 days immediately prior to the conversion. • The statement does not say what the proceeds are to be used for.   Vedanta Resources (LON:VED) 582.5 pence Mkt Cap 1.567bn – Q2 Production report highlights bauxite supply issues • Vedanta Resources reports strong production growth from its Indian zinc operations with mined output rising by 13% during the quarter and by 26% in H1 to 240000 tonnes (472000 tonnes for the half year). 'The increase was driven by higher ore production across all mines.' • Refined zinc output rose by 17% during the quarter to 211000 tonnes and by 24% for the half year to 398000 tonnes. By product refined lead rose by 34% to 40000 tonnes in the quarter and by 17% in H1 to 71000 tonnes. Cost of production declined to US771/tonne compared to US799/tonne in Q1. • The international zinc operations fared less well with production at Lisheen which is nearing the end of its life and plans to cease production entirely in November 2015 down by 15% during the quarter to 31000 tonnes. The Skorpion operation in Namibia produced 17000 tonnes of refined zinc; down 38% from the 27000 tonnes in Q2 2015 as a result of both unplanned and scheduled shutdowns. • Overall Q2 production costs from Vedanta's international zinc operations of 1477/t of zinc are approximately 5% higher than the 1409/t reported for Q1. • Pre-stripping has commenced at Vedanta's Gamsberg zinc project in S Africa. • Iron ore production at Karnataka rose 5% to 0.6m tonnes during the quarter bringing H1 production to 1.2m tonnes. • Copper cathode output in India & Australia declined 6% to 94000 tonnes 'primarily due to a maintenance shutdown at the smelter.' A second smelter shutdown during late September is expected to impair cathode production during Q3 but the company asserts that the smelter is now operating normally. • Zambian copper mining operations increased output by 12% y-o-y during the quarter to 33000 tonnes bringing H2 to 62000 tonnes. Improved maintenance practices at Konkola have increased the availability of mobile plant and rehabilitation work on the number 4 shaft which is expected to be completed during Q3 has incrementally improved hoisting capacity. • Production at Nchanga 'copper production  remained stable at 4800 tonnes per month' despite throughput constraints at the mill and reduced availability of dump trucks. • Power supply constraints from Copperbelt Energy Corporation have led to KCM reducing its refinery operations so as to produce around 80% of its copper in cathode form with the balance being sold as anodes. These measures resulted in a 4.6% reduction in power supply during the quarter however the company comments that 'The price of imported power to replace the reduced supply is unsustainable in the long run and discussions with interested parties including the government are underway.' • The Lanjigarh alumina refinery continues to perform well with a 20% y-o-y production increase during the quarter to 272000 tonnes bringing H1 production to 541000 tonnes. Costs of alumina production fell by 20% to 299/tonne from 340/tonne in Q1. However 'Due to non-availability of captive bauxite and cost optimisation drive across the business production capacity at the Lanjigarh alumina refinery has been reduced to a single stream and it will now operate at a capacity of c. 800kt.' • The company is focussing on increasing free cash flow and reducing net debt through optimisation of capital and operating costs and 'Net debt at the end of the quarter is expected to be below US8bn and we are confident of meeting our covenants at Vedanta Resources plc as at 30 September 2015.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:40:39.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
