Source: AAP\nHe said the ball stopped swinging after about 10 overs and, although not out fielding at night, reckoned its condition would’ve restricted visibility.\n“It looked as though the lacquer had come off basically, and it was turning green,” he added.\n“There were bits of pink left, but there was probably more green than pink by the end.\n“The older it gets, I can’t see it being any easier to see.”\nThe Kiwis had a couple of days to test the pink ball in Hamilton last week.\nBut opener Tom Latham, who finished on 131 after a 196-run opening stand with Martin Guptill (94), said he had a little bit of trouble judging the ball early and found it difficult to spot square on while fielding.\n“The ball deteriorated a little bit more than what we’ve seen,” he said.\n“If we can keep that ball in good knick, then hopefully that’ll be one of our weapons the reverse swing.”\nAustralia’s Test stars will be given an insight into what lies ahead when they play the opening round of the Sheffield Shield season, which starts on Wednesday.\nIt wasn’t much fun batting at night. Source: AFP\nIt will be their only pink-ball match practice before the Test opener at the Gabba.\nCricket Australia remain confident the Test will be a success, having produced a million-dollar carrot to convince players on either side of the Tasman.\nMeanwhile, Latham said the win was a nice way to start the tour and hoped to continue the momentum into the next two days.\nHe praised both Boult and Southee for their efforts in tearing down the PM’s XI top order.\n“We’ve certainly got a lot of confidence in them,” he said.\n“I think the way they’ve been bowling the last couple of years has been outstanding and they certainly set the tone at the top of the innings for us.”\nVoges, whose half-century impressed retired wicketkeeper turned commentator Brad Haddin, relished the chance to look at the Kiwi attack having not faced them before.\n“I get another opportunity over the next couple of days, so everytime I go out there I’ve just got to try and make as many runs as I possibly can,” he said.\n“It was nice to get a few tonight but it would’ve been nice to get a lot more.”\nOriginally published as Pink ball was turning green", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/24/1227580/728824-3b7a5e78-79cc-11e5-b858-124d84ad5405.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/24/1227580/729315-61d97586-79cc-11e5-b858-124d84ad5405.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/cricket/australian-vice-captain-adam-voges-slams-pink-ball-for-first-day-night-test/story-fndpt0dy-1227580728851"], "published": "2015-10-24T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:05:50.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
