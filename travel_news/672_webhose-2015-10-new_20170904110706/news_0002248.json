There are only two ways of getting to the Sossusvlei clay and salt pans: either a six-hour drive from Windhoek, mostly along an unpaved road, or with a flight on a six-seater plane that lands on a gravel airstrip.\nThere's a wide selection of lodges around Sossusvlei, but for astronomy buffs, the andBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge treats the stars as a main attraction.\nOn a hill above the dining area, an observatory hosts a 12-inch telescope, with a resident astronomer to navigate the sky.\n\"With the telescope, we start by showing the bright planets and the moon when they are visible, and our close neighbor star, the double star Alpha Centauri,\" said andBeyond CEO Joss Kent.\n\"Then we look at some of the bright, very well-known objects in the far southern sky.\"\nThe neighborhood star factory\nWith the telescope, familiar objects become less so.\nWithin the Southern Cross is the Jewel Box, which looks like a star to the naked eye but is actually a cluster of stars with an orange supergiant surrounded by cooler blue neighbors.\nIn the Large Magellanic Cloud, the Tarantula Nebula was also once thought to be a star.\nIt's actually a spidery cloud of dust and gas, and one of the biggest star factories in our galactic neighborhood.\nInside are some of the biggest and brightest stars ever discovered.\nCloser to home, the 12-inch Meade LX200 telescope shows the rings of Saturn and the moons of Jupiter.\nWith an astronomer to guide the stargazing, it's easy to spend hours looking at the sky, peering at even faint objects like planetary nebulae and galaxies up to 60 million light years away.\nThe telescope is computerized with tracking software, so it can hone in on distant objects with remarkable ease.\nSleeping beneath the stars\nThe lodge has a resident astronomer to help you sort your Ursa Majors from your Ursa Minors. To get certified as an International Dark Sky Reserve, the lodge had to remove many outside lights.\nPaths to the guest rooms are lit with red energy-saver bulbs that help with night vision.\nAnd once in bed, a skylight opens overhead so guests fall asleep under the stars.\nandBeyond Sossusvlei Desert Lodge , Sossusvlei, Sossusvlei, Namib-Naukluft Park Namibia;\nDuring the day, Namibia's iconic sand dunes are an hour's drive away.\nNamibRand is a private reserve, and the dunes are inside the adjacent Namib-Naukluft National Park.\nIn the morning the crowds wait at the gate, but they're only crowds in the Namibian sense.\nThis is one of the world's least populated countries (only Mongolia has fewer people per square mile) so traffic out here is maybe a dozen other vehicles.\nStill, that makes for a small parade of people hiking up the dunes -- although the word \"dunes\" doesn't quite do them justice.\nThese aren't rolling mounds on the beach suitable for buggies.\nThese are small mountains of red sand, up to 400 meters high, with a sharp ridge formed by the wind that makes for the easiest ascent.\nNamibRand Nature Reserve , Windhoek Namibia;\n600-year-old petrified trees\nFarther along is Deadvlei (vlei is a marsh in Afrikaans), a suitably creepy expanse of salt pans studded with dead trees.\nNot petrified trees, but 600-year-old dead trees scorched black by the sun.\nThe desert is so dry, they simply haven't decomposed.\nFew animals brave these conditions, but there are new things still being discovered.\nMiles Paul, one of the astronomers, discovered a new species of gecko in 2011 while on a hike.\nIt was named Pachydactylus etultra, for \"andBeyond\" in Latin.\nThe area around the lodge is still the only place it's ever been found.\nDeadvlei , near Sousselvlei, Sossusvlei, Namib-Naukluft Park Namibia;", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006152206-12-namibia-sossusvlei-deser-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006152206-12-namibia-sossusvlei-deser-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006152206-12-namibia-sossusvlei-deser-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006152206-12-namibia-sossusvlei-deser-full-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1184851-d4074559-Reviews-m14631-Deadvlei-Sossusvlei_Namib_Naukluft_Park_Khomas_Region.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006153003-05-namibia-plane-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006153003-05-namibia-plane-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006152206-12-namibia-sossusvlei-deser-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006152206-12-namibia-sossusvlei-deser-super-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293821-d478180-Reviews-m14631-NamibRand_Nature_Reserve-Windhoek_Khomas_Region.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006153003-05-namibia-plane-small-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g1184851-d607759-Reviews-m14631-AndBeyond_Sossusvlei_Desert_Lodge-Sossusvlei_Namib_Naukluft_Park_Khomas_Region.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006152206-12-namibia-sossusvlei-deser-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006153003-05-namibia-plane-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006153003-05-namibia-plane-large-169.jpg", "http://www.andbeyond.com/sossusvlei-desert-lodge/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006153003-05-namibia-plane-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151006153003-05-namibia-plane-super-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:26:54.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
