Interest-free days on purchases: Up to 55 Interest rate on cash advances: 21.49% p.a. International transaction fee: 3.0% Minimum income requirement: $75,000 p.a. Minimum credit limit: $15,000\n^ Currently waived in the first year\nEarning points for free flights: 5/5 Spend at least $7,500 in the first three months of holding a new ANZ Frequent Flyer Black account and you'll be rewarded with a bonus 75,000 Qantas Points in addition to the points you'd normally earn on your everyday spend.\nWhen combined, that's more than enough for a return upgrade from discount economy to Qantas business class between Australia and either Singapore or Hong Kong, or for a one-way economy flight from Sydney to London, plus taxes and fees.\nAirport lounge access: 5/5 Cardholders can request two free Qantas Club lounge passes each year – valid in domestic Qantas Club lounges and the airline's international business class lounges – and can enjoy two free yearly visits to the American Express Sydney Airport lounge .\nFlash your ANZ Frequent Flyer Black AMEX for lounge access at Sydney Airport For more frequent travellers, Qantas Club membership can also be purchased via ANZ for just $400/year (down from $895 for newcomers), while unlimited access is also provided to lounges in the Velocé international network such as in Auckland, Singapore and Hong Kong.\nFree international travel insurance: 5/5 Charge just $250 of your international flight, accommodation or other associated costs to either Frequent Flyer Black card and ANZ's free travel insurance has you covered on trips of up to six months. Interstate flight inconvenience insurance and rental car excess cover are also available.\nANZ Frequent Flyer Black: our verdict For frequent flyer points alone, NAB's Qantas Rewards Premium cards provide a similar earning rate for a lower $250 ongoing annual fee, although with ANZ's deal offering no annual fee in the first year, discounts on Qantas Club membership and unlimited lounge access, ANZ Frequent Flyer Black could well pay for itself in years two and beyond.\nThe only major downside? Both the Commonwealth Diamond Awards and Westpac Altitude Black cards provide complimentary Starwood Preferred Guest Gold status after staying with the chain for just one night, which in turn provides perks such as hotel room upgrades and bonus points.\nAlso read: ANZ Qantas Frequent Flyer Platinum credit card review\n Twitter: Chris Chamberlin Chris lives by the motto that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, a great latte, an opera ticket and a glass of wine!\nFollow @ausbt on Email: @MusoJournoChris\nGoogle+: Chris Chamberlin Share this Review have something to say?
