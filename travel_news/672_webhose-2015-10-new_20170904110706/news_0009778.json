Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign . GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterwards we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos (Executive Chairman President and CEO): Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign . Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year over year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $157 million in free cash flow. We processed 9.2 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.68 million net new names ending with 135.2 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our commitment to returning value to shareholders continue during the third quarter as we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $156 million. As of September 30, 2015, we have 605 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. As discussed on our last call, we're making progress as we prepare to launch the internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. Our launch preparations are proceeding according to plan as we prepare to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year. We will provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate. I will comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the domain name basin .com and .net was $135.2 million, consisting of 120.1 million names per .com and 50.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.4% year over year as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. 1 of 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:55:26.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
