The drop coincided with a slide in the value of the ruble versus the dollar. \nAs well, four-star accommodation in Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, dropped 30% to $152, along with a decline in the Brazilian real versus the loonie. \nIt's a good time for Canadians to travel to those cities, \"especially if you wanted to splurge,\" said Hotels.com travel expert Taylor Cole. \nWarsaw offered the cheapest price for a five-star room during the same period -- C$148 -- followed by Berlin at $193 and Mumbai at $198. \nAt the other end of the scale, Canadians paid the most for five-star hotels in Los Angeles ($730), Montreal ($629), Tokyo ($607), Honolulu ($606) and Miami ($601). \nThe data are based on Hotels.com bookings. The company notes there is no worldwide star-rating system. \n\"Travellers should be aware of a possible disparity of standards and facilities when booking rooms with the same star ratings in different countries,\" Hotels.com says.
