Vendor Network is focused on helping automotive companies manage and benefit from this shift.\n\"With more players, sales channels and marketing platforms than ever, it's not just what you sell but how you sell it,\" says CEO Ken LeBlanc . \"Visibility is crucial and everything we do is geared toward strategically placing products online with the information and experience necessary to turn shoppers into buyers.\"\nVendor Network partners with automotive parts sellers to broaden their marketplace exposure, pull in buyers and boost sales.
