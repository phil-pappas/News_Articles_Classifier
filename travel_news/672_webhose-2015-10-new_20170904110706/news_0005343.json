Minister St.Ange was standing alongside his PS for Culture, Benjamine Rose; the French Ambassador, H.E. Lionel Majeste-Larrouy; Jimmy Savy, the CEO of the NAC (National Arts Council); SEYMAS Committee Members; and many musicians and artists as well as the architects and representatives from the Ministry responsible for Lands and Planning (MLUH) when he was called to lay the foundation stone for the new project that will be called home to the Seychelles musicians, artists, entertainers, and those who are part of the cultural industry of the islands. \nMinister Alain St.Ange said when he addressed those present that October 23 will be seen as the day of culture. \"Today, we signed a memo to request the PS for Culture to work with the Attorney General of Seychelles to start the processes to have the 1935 Colonial era Drums Regulation of the Penal Code removed from the Laws of Seychelles. Now we are placing the foundation stone for a Music Stadium and Arts Village right here in Victoria. This foundation stone was placed alongside you, artists and musicians, for a project that will be for you artists and musicians,\" said Minister St.Ange. \nThe plans for the new Music Stadium and Arts Village was displayed for all to see by the architects and representatives of the MLUH, and it received the nod of approval from all present. \nMinister St.Ange told members of the cultural industry present that they had a government who had the political will to deliver for them a project that they have been requesting. \"Today you see that you are all respected and that your industry is seen as a valued industry of our country. But this has not always been like this. At one time you could not beat your drums in Victoria after 9 pm and rest assured that you still have some right here in our country who question your importance. This is why I say to you all, remain united. Work with us at the Department of Culture as one, and we shall continue to see the light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Minister Alain St.Ange, as he assured the musicians and artists that the high cost for staging musical events will be history with this facility that is now theirs. \nJimmy Savy, the CEO of the NAC (National Arts Council), said as he addressed the gathering that a lot had been done for the cultural industry of Seychelles. \"We have been working with you and will continue to work with you for the continued growth of your industry. The situation we see in Seychelles today has never been so inspiring for those who are involved in the cultural industry,\" said Mr. Jimmy Savy of the NAC. \nJoseph Sinon, who took to the podium on behalf of fellow entertainers, artists, and musicians, said that it was today a great day for Seychelles. \"We are having now our very own Music Stadium and Arts Village. We thank the government as a whole, the NAC, but also our Minister of Culture, Minister Alain St.Ange, and his PS Benjamine Rose. We shall fight to keep what is today ours, this piece of land in the heart of Victoria. Before the end of the year, we shall stage an event here in English River, and the local small entrepreneurs from English River will be invited to work with us on that night so that they can appreciate the economic boost that the cultural industry brings to a community,\" said Mr. Joseph Sinon. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
