Maximum sustained winds were clocked at 165 mile per hour, still at the Category 5 level. \nFour hours later, Patricia was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane, still packing powerful damaging winds at 130 miles per hour. The storm was racing along at around 20 miles per hour, heading in a northeasterly direction. Of great concern is the heavy rainfall which will likely cause flooding and mudslides. \nSo far, Hurricane Patricia has pushed through the state of Jalisco, and its current path will probably mean that tourist destination Puerto Vallarta will be spared a direct hit, but a hurricane warning will remain in effect for it as well as Manzanillo. The storm appears to be heading towards Guadalajara, and a tropical storm warning stands for the eastern area of Punta San Telmo to Lazaro Cardenas, as well as north of San Blas to El Roblito. \nResort areas Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo could see heavy rainfall, but no watches or warnings are in effect for these areas, along with Acapulco. \nHurricane Patricia will go down in history as the the strongest Pacific hurricane on record to date, with maximum sustained winds early on recorded at 200 miles per hour.
