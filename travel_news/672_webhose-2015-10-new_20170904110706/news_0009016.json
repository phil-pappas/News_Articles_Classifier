Authentic Cuba is a campaign to promote tourist destinations in the Caribbean Island.\nXiomara Martinez, Director of the Office of Tourism of Cuba here, said the Island’s attractions go beyond sun and beaches because the Cuban and Mexican peoples are united by history, traditions and culture. She promoted the legendary cities of Cuba: Baracoa, Bayamo, Trinidad, Sancti Spiritus, Camaguey, Remedios and Santiago de Cuba, who already celebrated the 500th anniversary of their foundation.\nIn the next few days Authentic Cuba will be in the states of Monterrey, Cohauila, Jalisco and Guanajuato.\nInterjet airline announced new flights between the two nations during the presentation.
