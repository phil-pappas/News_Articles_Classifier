John Greenleaf, global head, DoubleTree by Hilton said, “At DoubleTree by Hilton, our hospitality starts with the presentation of our signature, freshly-baked chocolate chip cookie at check-in. Liverpool is a thriving cultural, historical and commercial centre, and we’re looking forward to hosting the increasing number of both leisure and corporate visitors the city is seeing.” Terence Southward, general manager, DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Spa Liverpool, said, “The hotel is truly unique in that it combines 19th century splendor with the contemporary vibrancy of a 21st century hotel.
