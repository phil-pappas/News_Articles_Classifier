Guests enjoyed a debut screening of Victoria Warehouse’s showreel which took them on a journey through the fascinating history of one of Manchester’s largest hidden gems, from 1920s speakeasy right through to contemporary Manchester. Throughout the evening, guests were treated to mouth-watering catering courtesy of Smart Hospitality Manchester, signature cocktails and captivating entertainment from a live violinist and saxophonist. \nDaniel Thorpe, general manager at Victoria Warehouse, said: “The launch event for The Bays was a huge success and we were delighted to be able to showcase our newest event space and highlight its versatility in accommodating any kind of event. During the evening, we took the opportunity to highlight the incredible history of the venue with the debut screening of our showreel. “Victoria Warehouse stands as a symbol of the city’s industrial strength and innovation and we wanted to give our guests an insight not only into the background of the venue, but how it has transformed since the 1900s to become a venue that really captures the imagination.” The Bays offers two event spaces with Bay 1 able to host receptions for up to 200 guests, while Bay 2 has capacity for 360 guests reception-style, 270 for a dinner and 310 in theatre-style seating. The unveiling of the new space is just the beginning of a wider expansion plan which will see the addition of 400 rooms to the venue’s onsite hotel and a new 900-capacity basement space. All catering in The Bays will be provided by Smart Hospitality Manchester, and day delegate rates begin at £35 per person.
