Benazir Bhutto International Airport (Islamabad, Pakistan) – Ranked the world's \"Worst Airport of 2014,\" Islamabad's international airport has seen improvements over the past year, said Sleeping in Airports. Washrooms have been upgraded, while a new lounge has been added. The airport also increased the number of check-in and immigration counters. Nonetheless, critics say it could still use a good scrub, better crowd control and friendlier staff. Hide Caption 2 of 20 20 photos: The world's worst and best airports of 2015 Worst: 8. Tan Son Nhat International Airport (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) – Numerous survey respondents made allegations of impropriety, says Sleeping in Airports.

Hide Caption 3 of 20 20 photos: The world's worst and best airports of 2015 Worst: 7. Hamid Karzai International Airport (Kabul, Afghanistan) – \"Given the current political state of Afghanistan relative to other nations on this global list, we're reluctant to criticize Kabul's international airport too harshly,\" said Sleeping in Airports, noting that the international terminal has undergone a number of renovations over the last decade, making it a little more friendly to travelers. Voters complained about overall cleanliness, a lack of comfort and the accountability of staff. Hide Caption 4 of 20 20 photos: The world's worst and best airports of 2015 Worst: 6. Toussaint Louverture International Airport (Port au Prince, Haiti) – Sweltering heat, a lack of chairs and untrustworthy staff were the biggest complaints among travelers who gave Haiti's international gateway the thumbs down. \"The good news is that renovations are said to be currently underway, giving a little bit of hope to the future of PAP,\" said Sleeping in Airports. Hide Caption 5 of 20 20 photos: The world's worst and best airports of 2015 Worst: 5.

Hide Caption 7 of 20 20 photos: The world's worst and best airports of 2015 Worst: 3. Tribhuvan International Airport (Kathmandu, Nepal) – Though Nepal's only international airport gathered ample criticism over the past year, Sleeping in Airports stressed the country has been under considerable pressure following April's devastating earthquake that damaged its sole runway. \"Given this, voters had understandably poor experiences at the airport, particularly within the domestic terminal,\" said the website. \"The good news is that KTM is currently re-building the much-loathed domestic terminal.\" Hide Caption 8 of 20 20 photos: The world's worst and best airports of 2015 Worst: 2.
