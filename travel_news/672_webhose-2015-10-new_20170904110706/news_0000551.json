Lufthansa will fly five times a week, while BA will be daily.\nBoth services will be a first for the respective airlines and Lufthansa’s will be the first link from mainland Europe to San Jose. The carriers were attracted by the technology and internet industries around San Jose, but also those of\nthe biotech, pharmaceuticals and medical sectors plus the research facilities of a number of major car manufacturers housed there.\nAnother incentive was San Jose airport’s new international terminal, which has attracted services to destinations including Tokyo and Beijing.\nLufthansa will use an Airbus A340-300 and fly on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The outbound flight departs Frankfurt at 10.40 and the return leaves San Jose at 15.20, with a flying time of around 12 hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:59:55.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
