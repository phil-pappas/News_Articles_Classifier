The 90 second film marks the first time that Celebrity Cruises has carried out a TV brand campaign since operating as a standalone business. \nThe new brand film content is being shared with agent partners, alongside a specially developed guide to making the most of the film when promoting and selling Celebrity Cruises. Agents were the first to see the new film ahead of it airing on television and Channel 4’s portfolio of video-on-demand services at an event in central London on 8 October 2015. Jo Rzymowska, managing director, Celebrity Cruises UK and Ireland, explains: “Our new brand film really highlights everything that is unique about our holidays in a very evocative and inspiring way. Everything that is seen in our new film is through the eyes and encounters of real guests onboard and presents a different view of cruising that we know only Celebrity Cruises offers. The stunning views and landscapes merge with the award-winning onboard experiences. We are working with our agent partners to ensure that they can make the most of it, and maximise the content across their digital channels.” In true Celebrity Cruises style the new brand film has been created in a highly innovative way. Working with Genero - a platform that allows businesses to connect directly with filmmakers around the world - the film was shot on-board Celebrity Silhouette during a Mediterranean cruise and in ports-of-call destinations throughout France, Italy and Spain by director James Morgan. This fresh approach to content generation is a first for the cruise industry. To showcase the real spirit of a Celebrity Cruises holiday there are no actors or models in the footage. All of the people who appear are guests or crew members giving viewers a true reflection of the experience at sea, and a taster of what to expect from a holiday with the modern luxury brand. As well as the premiere on Channel 4 on 11 October 2015 during the highly anticipated return of the drama series Homeland, shorter 30 and 10 second edits of the brand film will air Channel 4, More4 and Film 4 throughout October and November 2015. Rzymowska continues: “Everything that agents will see in our new brand film is through the eyes and encounters of real guests on-board. The stunning views and landscapes merge with the award-winning on-board experiences. We’re encouraging agents to use the film when talking to their luxury travel customers and to aid their own understanding of what makes Celebrity Cruises different.” To support the new brand film, Celebrity Cruises is also running a dedicated agent competition on its trade partner Facebook page at Facebook.com/CelebrityTravelAgents where agents can win Waitrose and John Lewis gift vouchers. The competition will commence on 12 October 2015.
