They tend to be middle-aged people. They are good neighbours. \n\"The association is very responsible. It is serious about protecting the environment. \n\"I hope the community can get behind it. If we don't get a site it will be a lost opportunity. If someone has suitable land to lease or buy please let us know.\" \nThe Marlborough committee of the New Zealand Motor Caravan Association would manage the site. \nCommittee chairman Sid Nally said two areas had already been looked at. \nIf land was found and the park got the go-ahead, it would cater for 100 self-contained caravans. \nThey wanted a park where members could stay for three nights, charging $4 a night. \nThe park would have to be fenced and gated and only members would have a key to keep out freedom campers, Nally said. \nThe association had 1000 members in Marlborough and 60,000 nationwide. \nMovanning was continually rising, Nally said. \n\"It's the Kiwi way to get out and visit out of the way places. \n\"If we can get a small percentage of those people to come to Renwick it will be great for business. Imagine all those people going into Renwick to grab a coffee, buy some groceries or get a beer in the tavern.\" - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:46:29.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
