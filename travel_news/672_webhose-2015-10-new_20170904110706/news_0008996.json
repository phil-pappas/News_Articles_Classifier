On this additional capacity, system wide traffic for September increased 10.1 percent. Air Canada reports traffic results on a system-wide basis, including regional airlines from which Air Canada purchases capacity and Air Canada rouge. \n\"I am pleased to report continued strong traffic growth of 10.1 percent and a load factor of 83.6 percent for the month of September,\" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Air Canada generated greater traffic in all markets served led by the U.S. transborder, Pacific and Atlantic markets. In particular, the Atlantic market grew 12.7 percent in September despite the higher than normal volumes in traffic the previous year resulting from labour disruptions that affected certain European carriers. Load factor of 86.9 percent for the third quarter is in line with last year's record for the same period. These strong results demonstrate the effectiveness of our commercial strategy focusing on international growth. This year's Ipsos Reid Business Traveller Survey released in September confirms Air Canada is the preferred airline for frequent business travelers by a continuingly growing margin. I would like to thank our customers for choosing Air Canada and our employees for taking care of them while transporting them safely to their destination.\" \nSeptember Q3 Year-To-Date 2015 2014 Change 2015 2014 Change 2015 2014 Change Traffic (RPMs mln) 6,104 5,545 +10.1% 20,462 18,565 +10.2% 52,244 47,526 +9.9% Capacity (ASMs mln) 7,301 6,546 +11.5% 23,535 21,299 +10.5% 62,002 56,486 +9.8% Load Factor 83.6% 84.7% -1.1 pts 86.9% 87.2% -0.3 pts 84.3% 84.1% +0.2 pts \nCanada RPMs 1,630 1,587 +2.7% 5,606 5,417 +3.5% 13,936 13,472 +3.4% ASMs 2,028 1,937 +4.7% 6,649 6,344 +4.8% 16,739 16,201 +3.3% LF 80.4% 81.9% -1.5 pts 84.3% 85.4% -1.1 pts 83.3% 83.2% +0.1 pts \nUS Transborder RPMs 858 739 +16.1% 2,992 2,588 +15.6% 8,987 7,782 +15.5% ASMs 1,090 930 +17.2% 3,539 3,074 +15.2% 10,806 9,396 +15.0% LF 78.7% 79.5% -0.8 pts 84.5% 84.2% +0.3 pts 83.2% 82.8% +0.4 pts \nAtlantic RPMs 2,092 1,857 +12.7% 6,792 6,028 +12.7% 14,593 12,916 +13.0% ASMs 2,389 2,074 +15.2% 7,640 6,781 +12.7% 17,338 15,514 +11.8% LF 87.6% 89.6% -1.9 pts 88.9% 88.9% 0.0 pts 84.2% 83.3% +0.9 pts \nPacific RPMs 1,230 1,086 +13.3% 3,877 3,460 +12.1% 10,335 9,409 +9.8% ASMs 1,413 1,265 +11.7% 4,318 3,861 +11.8% 11,939 10,748 +11.1% LF 87.1% 85.8% +1.3 pts 89.8% 89.6% +0.2 pts 86.6% 87.5% -0.9 pts \nLatin America & Caribbean RPMs 294 276 +6.5% 1,195 1,072 +11.5% 4,393 3,947 +11.3% ASMs 381 340 +12.1% 1,389 1,239 +12.1% 5,180 4,627 +12.0% LF 77.1% 81.1% -4.1 pts 86.0% 86.5% -0.5 pts 84.8% 85.3% -0.5 pts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:18:04.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
