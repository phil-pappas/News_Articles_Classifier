Located at the Y-Juncture Gallery past the A Concourse bridge security checkpoint, the exhibition is on display through March 2016.\nAccording to Michael Golembeski, director and founder of the WindDancer Foundation, Facing the Wind will provide travelers with an opportunity to experience the wild horses that live on our public lands in 10 western states. Along with the Native Americans and the bison, the wild horse remains one of the great symbols of the American West. Always colorful characters in the wild and the object of many tales, they hold an invaluable place in the unfolding of America’s history. The WindDancer Foundation coordinated with 18 artists to create the exhibition: Katie Simpson, Yva Monatiuk and John Eastcott, John Wagner, Pat Brennan, Gail deMonet, Bristol MacDonald, Mark Terrell, Lynne Pomeranz, Tony Stromberg, Lee Mitchelson, Tamara Rymer, Barbara and Marty Wheeler, Kimberlee Curyl, Lisa Dearing, Tamara Gooch and Joe Tosh.\nSource:- Denver International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:21.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
