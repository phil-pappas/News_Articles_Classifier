YOUTUBE/VEVO1 \nThe woman was caught on camera trying to get past security. \n\"She bought some fruits when travelling in Yunnan and worried that the waiting time to board would be long,\" said the security worker. \n\"So she wanted to bring a fruit knife to cut up her food as a snack.\" \nSecurity did not agree that the potential weapon was just a hair piece and it was confiscated. \nStaff had previously had issues with large amounts of alcohol trying to be taken onboard. In August, a passenger was told her US$200 (NZ$309) bottle of cognac exceeded the 100ml limit and couldn't be taken on board. She wasn't fazed, and instead sculled the entire thing. \nIn July, security seized a lighter shaped like a grenade that exploded in a staff member's hand causing injury. Another passenger used a lighter to set a couple of seats on fire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:02:30.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
