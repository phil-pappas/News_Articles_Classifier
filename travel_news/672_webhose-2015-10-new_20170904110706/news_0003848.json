The pace of change seems to match the inching of glaciers across the Alps — grindingly slow, even by the standards of conservative Switzerland.\nAlthough Swiss women won the right to vote on the federal level in 1971, Appenzellerland’s two subcantons, or localities, were the last in the nation to concede women a vote, in 1989 and 1990.\nOne subcanton, Appenzell Innerrhoden, remains the last place in Switzerland where local issues are still decided by open-air voting. Men turn out to vote in the town square wearing swords, while women bake pastries.\nIn Urnaesch, the cow-welcoming processions followed an established order. First came a young boy in yellow leather lederhosen, an embroidered red vest and knee-high white socks. He was followed by a girl in a striped frock, tending a flock of goats. Then came a herdsman in traditional garb matching the boy’s , plus a black hat festooned with flowers and metalwork decorating his suspenders, pipe or watch chain.\nThen came the cows deemed most perfect in body and milk production, bearing the heavy bells on colorful, intricately worked leather collars.\nFinally were the yodelers. Their singing kept the animals together and moving down the mountain. The rest of the herd followed.\nThe hike from the limestone flanks of the craggy Santis mountain took most of the day.\nThe region is no longer dependent on cattle for survival, and modern comforts such as indoor heating have softened the effect of weather.\nBut centuries-old rituals remain important markers of identity to many Appenzellers, said Erika Kist, of the Museum for Appenzeller Traditions.\nIn addition to the descent of cows at the end of summer, Appenzellerland hosts cattle shows in the fall, a celebration of the herds’ ascent to the high pastures in spring and ancient midwinter rites in which men dress up in fearsome costumes to scare away evil spirits.\nIF YOU GO \nSwitzerland: Towns celebrate the return of cows from higher pastures.\nFor a schedule of Alpine festivals, visit  www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/service-updates/events.html?strubrik2312", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T14:46:48.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
