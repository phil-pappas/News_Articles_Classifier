This new system truly allows airlines to unlock the potential of fleet-wide digital records management.\" \nThe Records module creates intelligent digital maintenance documents, featuring dynamic records search capabilities. The record-keeping tool improves airline maintenance workflow capabilities and ties into maintenance planning solutions, establishing systems that work in concert to further enhance the automation of processes and overall efficiency. \nSimple access to the Records module provided through the Boeing Maintenance Performance Toolbox application offers an operational advantage for airlines seeking integrated solutions for all their technical documentation management needs. This includes more than 160 customers that currently use the Maintenance Performance Toolbox suite.
