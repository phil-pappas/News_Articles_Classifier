In terms of target markets, we are eyeing FITs and selected visitors so definitely not the mass market. \n\n“MICE is also on our wish list as a new convention centre with a capacity for 10,000 (pax) just opened and it is branded as the newest facility in South America.” \n\nDowntown Mexico City.

Therefore, we may increase awareness by participating in more trade events and this sales mission could possibly be regular practice,” she added. \n\nBased on UNWTO/GTERC’s 2015 annual report on Asian tourism trends, it identifies both Asia and Latin America as the two regions with the largest propensity for growth. In fact, outbound traffic from Asia is still considered nascent. \n\nIn 2014, Mexico was the leading destination for Asia’s travellers, attracting 340,000 visitors from the region last year. Peru is another popular pick with 163,000 arrivals from Asia, while Chile’s count is lower with about 100,000 visitors last year.
