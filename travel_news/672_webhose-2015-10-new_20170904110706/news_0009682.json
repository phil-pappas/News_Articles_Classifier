Like when you board your flight and realize the ridiculously good-looking traveler you couldn't help but notice at the check-in counter is actually seated next to you. Hide Caption 3 of 23 23 photos: Unexpected reunions – Bumped into an old friend in a strange place? Try to play it cool for at least five minutes before losing your shirt, wearing a rainbow wig and shouting, \"I love you man!\" Hide Caption 4 of 23 23 photos: Waking up to sunshine when rain had been forecast – It's like being given an extra day of vacation. Hide Caption 5 of 23 23 photos: Overcoming language barriers – By pointing at the clock, mimicking the action of fishing and drawing a map, this Japanese chef shared the secret to the freshness of the tuna he'd just served -- it'd come from the ocean five hours earlier.

But who's this vision in company-issue nylon getting you on the next flight at no extra charge? Hide Caption 7 of 23 23 photos: Getting the whole row to yourself – You board the plane for your long-haul flight, cram into the middle seat and pray your yet-to-arrive seatmates aren't going to smell, talk to you, get wasted, hog the arm rest, have weak bladders.

Hide Caption 13 of 23 23 photos: Finding out your favorite band is playing in the city you're visiting – Doesn't matter if you've seen the Red Hot Chili Peppers live back home 20 times.
