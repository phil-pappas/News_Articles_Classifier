Judges will meet next month to analyse and re-assess the shortlisted companies, and agree on the final winners.\nAwards head judge Mike Toynbee praised the high standard of entries.\n\"The response this year has been the best ever – in one category alone we had in excess of 30 entries – and the standard has never been better. The judges certainly had their work cut out and drawing up the shortlist proved harder than ever, with the top contenders in some categories separated by a mere point or two.”\nBBT would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the judges for their time and effort in marking all of the entries.\nTo view the full shortlist in each category please click here \nWinners of the 2016 Business Travel Awards will be announced at London’s Grosvenor House, a JW Marriott hotel, on Monday, January 18, 2016. If you have not yet booked your table there is still time, although you’ll need to be quick, as we have already sold more than 950 seats.
