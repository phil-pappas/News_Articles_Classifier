The market size is calculated based on the revenue generated through the sales of automotive pistons globally. The report presents five key vendors and a detailed analysis of these vendors. Based on the type of material used for automotive piston manufacturing, the market is segmented into aluminum-based pistons and steel-based pistons. The report includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\nSourcing products from low-cost countries has significantly increased during the past decade. Low-cost countries in APAC such as China and India have a strong positive impact on the automotive piston and the ancillary products markets, which has established cost competitiveness in the market for global players in this sector. With the rise in manufacturing costs, existing piston manufacturers in the US and Europe are shifting their operations to APAC, where labor, raw materials, and other facilities are available at a low cost. Strong engineering skills and the relatively low cost of the skilled workforce in emerging economies such as South Korea , China and India are attracting manufacturers to shift their operations in these countries.\nAccording to the report, the automotive industry in markets such as India , China , South Korea , and Mexico is growing at a steady pace, which in turn is leading to increased demand for automotive pistons. Improvements in the economic conditions of emerging countries have increased the demand for and production of automobiles in these countries. The growing demand for commercial vehicles in these countries is also boosting the growth of the automotive piston market.\nFurther, the report states that the shifting focus on EVs would pose a significant degree of threat to the automotive piston market during the forecast period.\nKey vendors\n- Aisin Seiki\n- Art Metal\n- Federal-Mogul\n- KSPG\n- Mahle Group\nOther prominent vendors\n- Arias Piston\n- Capricorn Automotive\n- Celina Aluminum Precision Technology\n- Cheng Shing Piston\n- Day Piston\n- Hitachi Automotive Systems\n- JE Pistons\n- Piston Automotive\n- ROSS RACING PISTONS\n- Shandong Binzhou Bohai Piston\n- Shriram Pistons & Rings\n- Sparex\n- Topline Automotive Engineering\n- United Engine and Machine\n- Wiseco Piston\n- WÃ¶ssner Kolben\nKey Topics Covered:\nPart 01: Executive summary\nPart 02: Scope of the report\nPart 03: Market research methodology\nPart 04: Introduction\nPart 05: Global automotive market landscape\nPart 06: Global automotive market segmentation by vehicle type\nPart 07: Global automotive market segmentation by geography\nPart 08: Supply chain analysis of the automotive industry\nPart 09: Global automotive piston market landscape\nPart 10: Market size and forecast\nPart 11: Market segmentation by material type\nPart 12: Geographical segmentation\nPart 13: Market drivers\nPart 14: Impact of drivers\nPart 15: Impact of drivers and challenges\nPart 16: Market trends\nPart 17: Vendor landscape\nPart 18: Key vendor analysis\nPart 19: Appendix\nFor more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/j93p4w/global_automotive\nMedia Contact:\nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\n releases/automotive-piston-system-market-2015---global-analysis-and-forecasts-to-2019-300165384.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/automotive-piston-system-market-2015---global-analysis-and-forecasts-to-2019-300165384.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130307/600769", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/j93p4w/global_automotive", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN36779&Transmission_Id=201510230910PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN36779&DateId=20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:07:18.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
