I love him dearly, but he can be a bit lazy and has his head in the clouds. How do I refuse without hurting his feelings? A Some people might make great friends or excellent relatives, but if they are lazy, irresponsible, incompetent, slap-dash or simply have a fickle financial track record, steer well clear when it comes to business. Never mind how close they are, if you don’t rate their commercial ability then don’t get involved with them. Refuse as nicely as you can with phrases like, “I just don’t think we are cut out to work together”, “I wouldn’t want to risk our close friendship” or “It’s not for me, but I wish you luck.” Be as tactful as you can, but ensure he understands the answer is “No!” Q In a recent answer, you proposed a management school course to teach common sense. Can you define common sense – if you can’t say what it is, how can you teach it? A Your question made me realise that I regularly use the term “common sense” without having a ready-made definition, so I trawled through Google and discovered the phrase has been knocking around since Aristotle’s day. Most dictionaries talk about “sound judgment not based on specialised knowledge” or “sensible decisions taken following an uncomplicated view of the problem”. I spent some time trying to pick my favourite before I realised that defining common sense is counterproductive. Common sense is most clearly demonstrated when someone has the courage to fly in the face of process. The danger of a definition is that people will then want to define a process that can produce common sense. Despite the suggestion that common sense isn’t all that common, most people have it, but many are reluctant to use it when everyone else is saluting processes that are simply not sensible. Think of the little boy who watched the emperor showing off his new suit of clothes. Everyone knew the emperor was naked, but the little boy (because he hadn’t heard the PR story) was the only one with the courage to report what he saw. So much of our modern process parades around like the emperor, with few people having the courage or the clout to reveal its stupidity. Last year, I visited our shop near the entrance to a central London station. Understandably, since 7/7, there is a strict security regime with every retailer required to fully inspect the customer area of their shop every hour and complete a form to confirm that it is all clear. All right so far. Our shop (which could be called a kiosk) is only just big enough to fit in the shoe repair and key-cutting kit. The counter is right at the front, with an area 3ft x 8ft where, with a squeeze, two customers are able to stand. But, because all the other shops filled in the form, we had to look at this 24 sq ft of flooring on the hour, every hour, and just to make sure we complied, a security guard called hourly to check the paperwork. Not surprisingly, we never found anything more dramatic than a ballpoint pen and an empty crisp packet. One day our manager, who works alone, had to take a couple of pairs of shoes to another shop. He missed one of the hourly inspections – so the security guard shut our shop for the rest of the day and called for a full audit of the 24 sq ft before we were allowed to open again. We solved the problem – as the shop wasn’t particularly profitable, we closed it. We are surrounded by this sort of nonsense. Without complaint, most companies pay for electrical PAT testing when it isn’t a legal requirement. Company lawyers and accountants produce enormous annual reports that no one else bothers to read. I have no doubt such things will get worse. Without a clear definition, common sense has a great advantage. It is free to roam round a process-filled world exposing waste and rooting out a lot of the nonsense. Each year, our lives are filled with extra dollops of process. Instead of concentrating on the end result, more and more workers are employed to make sure that we all stick to the rules. The priority is to follow the process even if it gets in the way of success, We all have common sense – it would help if more of us had the courage to use it.
