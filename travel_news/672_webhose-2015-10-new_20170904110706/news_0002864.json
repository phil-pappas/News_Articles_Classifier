The hotel has become a casualty of plans to transform the entrance of Ayala Center Makati, where it sits, into a modern gateway of mixed-use developments. \n\nThe closure is timed with the termination of the hotel management contract between owner AyalaLand Hotels and Resorts Corp (AHRC) and InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG). \n\nCredit: InterContinental Manila \n\n“IHG continues to manage AHRC’s other property in Makati, Holiday Inn and Suites Makati. We remain focused on our growth in the Philippines and look forward to further opportunities with the group,” said Leanne Harwood, vice president, operations, South-east Asia, IHG. \n\nMichael Alexis Legaspi, COO, AHRC, said that all InterContinental Manila’s regular employees were first informed of the closure and given ample support and assistance. \n\n“We express our deep appreciation to our hotel colleagues and assure them that we are looking after their welfare, and we will assist them in making the transition as smooth as possible,” Legaspi said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:24:54.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
