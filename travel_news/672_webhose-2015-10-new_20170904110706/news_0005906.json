Tropicana Atlantic City is one of the largest properties on the famed Boardwalk.\nYESCO's display system fulfilled Tropicana's objective to become the main attraction on the Boardwalk. Through collaboration with SOSH Architects and Massett Building, the general contractor, YESCO's creative team created a new look for the resort's exterior that delivers a dynamic medium, immersing visitors with experiential show content while promoting the venue and generating advertising through branded media.\nThe dramatic Boardwalk entrance to Tropicana AC consists of five dynamic LED pylons centered by a 60' display. The pylons are connected by an undulating series of intricate panels made up of multiple layers of decorative metal and programmable lighting. Lighting is synchronized with audio and media content during show sequences that create dazzling presentations.\nYESCO's technical experts developed a versatile control system and content training for Tropicana's media team. Consistent with YESCO's 'keep it simple' philosophy regarding project control design, the system provides the ability to create and schedule new content through an existing content distribution network.\nClose coordination between YESCO, SOSH and Massett was essential to the success of the project. \"YESCO was great to work with all the way through this project. We placed a lot of trust in them, and they proved very worthy partners, both creatively and in their ability to develop accurate budgets as the design progressed. We always knew where we were and could present with the confidence that all costs were understood. YESCO's delivery of such a complex installation within stringent deadlines exceeded our expectations,\" said Bill Salerno , SOSH senior partner.\n\"We just couldn't be happier with the results and the transformation that this project has brought to Tropicana AC's presence on the Boardwalk. We imposed some aggressive schedule demands and had very high expectations for the outcome. YESCO delivered true to their word,\" said Tony Rodio , President and Chief Executive Officer of Tropicana Entertainment Inc.\nAbout YESCO:\nThomas Young founded Young Electric Sign Company (YESCO) in 1920 in Ogden, Utah .
