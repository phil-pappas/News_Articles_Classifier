Be Well at IMEX is a new program for the show which takes place 13 – 15 October in Las Vegas. \nLee Papa’s keynote address on Smart Monday, powered by MPI, provides a simple and dynamic approach to a topic that eludes many, mindfulness. This is followed by a motivational health workshop by MPI’s Ashley Darkenwald, a former gymnastics athlete and coach. During the three days of the show, the Inspiration Hub, home to all show floor education with over 180 sessions, includes a dedicated health and wellbeing track. These sessions include Building a care package for road warriors: promoting wellness at meetings and events - Dr. Mary Ellen Rose from the Institute for Healthy Destination Accreditation will advise on how to create a healthy working environment on the road, sharing wellbeing resources, plus tips and techniques for travelling. Diogo Assis, CEO of events by tlc and organiser of the new IMEXrun Las Vegas, will explore the growth of sports in the events industry and advise on building activities into a conference and event's agenda. Tips on maintaining healthy habits while travelling will be shared by Robyn Davis from WINH (When I Need Help). She explains: “Many professionals struggle to maintain their routines while traveling; however, eating right, exercising, getting proper sleep, and enriching their minds are all important, regardless of which time zone they’re in.” New for this year is a Meditation Room where renowned experts offer regular sessions on yoga, mindfulness and meditation as well as providing quiet time to recharge. This new space will host a series of early morning mindfulness activities run by Lee Papa’s expert team. Also new for this year is the IMEXrun Las Vegas - a five km street circuit run held on the morning of Wednesday 14 October. Sponsored by Embratur and RioTur and organised by sports by tlc, the run takes in the famous Las Vegas Strip and is a great opportunity to network and work out before the show opens. The IMEXrun Las Vegas - inspired by Rio de Janeiro - is open to all and builds on the successful riverside IMEXrun Frankfurt in the spring of this year that attracted nearly 250 runners. Carina Bauer, CEO of IMEX Group, concludes: “With packed schedules, healthy habits can often take a back seat. We’re keen to help attendees relax and recharge so they’re in top form to make the most of their busy days on the show floor. The launch of the new Meditation Room and the IMEXrun Las Vegas are two exciting ways attendees can boost their health at the show.” A new Vision & Wellbeing guide highlights initiatives at IMEX America helping attendees to stay healthy during their busy days at the show. World Thrombosis Day also takes place on October 13, the first day of the show. With hundreds of educational events in countries around the world, the annual event places a global spotlight on thrombosis as an urgent and growing health problem.
