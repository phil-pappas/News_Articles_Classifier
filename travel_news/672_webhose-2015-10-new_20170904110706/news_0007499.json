Jimmy Morales rose to fame playing the role of a simpleton cowboy who almost ends up becoming president.\nIn what some have called a case of life imitating art, the political outsider won the September 6 first-round election with 24 percent of the vote — after starting the campaign with just 0.5 percent support in April. He now looks set to follow through on that surprise victory.\nRunning for conservative party FCN-Nacion, Morales has led a light-hearted campaign, cracking jokes at rallies but giving few concrete details on his policy plans.\n“For 20 years, I’ve made you laugh. I promise that if I become president, I won’t make you cry,” he reassured voters.\nIn his 2007 film “A President in a Sombrero,” Morales played a hayseed named Neto who nearly gets elected president by making a string of empty promises, but ends up dropping out of the race and returning to his hometown.\nIn one of the film’s best-known scenes, Neto promises to build a bridge for residents of one downtrodden district. When informed there is no river there, he announces, “Then we will build them the rivers they need!”\nIn real life, the current race is his first foray into national politics, though he once ran unsuccessfully for mayor of his hometown.\nMorales briefly studied management at university, but never finished his degree.\nRecommended: The military powers behind Guatemala’s comedian presidential front-runner\nWhile he is uncontroversial, his party is not: It was founded in 2008 by former military officers accused of committing human rights violations during Guatemala ‘s civil war (1960-1996), which killed some 200,000 people.\nMorales, who hosts a comedy show on TV and also produces movies, is married with four children.\nGuatemalan candidate for the National Union of Hope party Sandra Torres is seen with a boy during the closing rally of her campaign at El Amparo neighborhood in Guatemala City on Oct. 23, 2015.\nJohan Ordoñez/AFP\nDetermined underdog Sandra Torres, the 60-year-old ex-wife of former president Álvaro Colom (2008-2011), divorced her husband to be eligible for the 2011 election, only to have her candidacy rejected by the Electoral Tribunal on grounds that she was still a close relation of the incumbent.\nHer hopes are now pinned on her poor rural base to deliver an upset Sunday.\nShe won 20 percent in the first-round vote, which ended in a down-to-the-wire race for runner-up.\nAfter 10 days of counting and recounting, election officials finally announced Torres had edged out millionaire businessman Manuel Baldizón, the man who many saw as Guatemala ‘s next president until the recent corruption scandals, which also tainted his conservative party.\nTorres is running for the social democratic party, UNE. Some of her critics accuse her of taking part in the guerrilla army that fought the Guatemalan government during the country’s 36-year civil war — a claim she has always denied. Others say\nAs head of the government’s social programs during her husband’s administration, she was considered a powerful and uncompromising figure, but she has sought to present a softer side on the campaign trail.\nAn outspoken activist for women’s and children’s rights, she has no children of her own.\nGuatemala is still recovering from its 36-year civil war, and 53.7 percent of the population lives in poverty. It also suffers under the scourge of powerful street gangs blamed for giving it one of the highest murder rates in the world.\nGuatemala, a country of 15.8 million people, has 7.5 million registered voters.\nPolls open at 7:00 a.m. local time and close at 6:00 p.m., with the first results expected after 9:00 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:06:58.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
