Each of the seven-day voyages aboard the 62-guest yacht can be combined with the following one to create expanded vacations without repeating ports. From the end of March through October of 2016, more than 30 itineraries will cruise to destinations, many of which are only accessible by smaller vessels, captivating guests with the destination's beauty, charm and historical significance.\n\"Crystal Esprit's Mediterranean and Adriatic Coast voyages reflect the yacht itself – sailing in a region that has long been beloved by Crystal guests and travelers the world over, but also exploring destinations in an entirely new way,\" says Crystal president and CEO, Edie Rodriguez . \"These itineraries perfectly blend some of Western Europe's most famously bustling cities with other, more remote and quaint spots.\"\nWith a focus on intimate access and active experiences, the sailings will offer new perspectives on currently favored destinations visited by the line's ocean-going ships, Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity. All of the itineraries have been carefully crafted to heavily explore several destinations within one or two countries, allowing guests a more immersive cultural experience. Some of the yacht's Mediterranean locales include:\nPiran, Slovenia – Set at the very tip of the Slovenian peninsula, which is the heart of what is affectionately known as the world's outdoor playground, but also boasting a beautifully-preserved historic Old Town. Here, Crystal guests can enjoy the bounty of natural adventures and meandering walkways between seafood restaurants.\nKotor, Montenegro – A tradition-rich town that blends imposing walled fortresses with welcoming piazzas. Set at the base of a dramatically sloped mountain, Kotor is loved by history buffs and travelers with a taste for striking architecture and rich cuisine. The spectacular Kotor Fjord that surrounds the destination is, in itself, a \"must see\" for travelers.\nLimassol, Cyprus – Truly a playground for virtually every type of traveler, with its storied past (look for Byzantine castles, Venetian walls and conflicting Greek and Turkish influences); outdoor escapes (with rugged landscapes that beckon hikers and explorers and waters that scuba divers find irresistible); and a vast menu of foods that reflect the many cultural influences on the island.\nKas, Turkey – Where divers will find more than exotic sea life, but also centuries-old shipwrecks to explore in the famously inviting waters. Besides the plethora of outdoor adventures for which Kas is ideal, the town is also populated with ancient walls, theaters and rock tombs that help tell its fabled history.\nWhile Crystal Esprit's itineraries along the Adriatic Coast and throughout the world will venture to new sites for the world's most awarded luxury cruise line, what will remain is Crystal's commitment to a superior standard of luxury for its globetrotting guests. Besides the vessel's all-suite design that boasts a distinct atmosphere of sailing aboard one's own private yacht, Crystal Esprit will be well appointed with elegant amenities; high-end finishes, modern technology and outfitted for adventure. This includes a two-passenger submarine, two 10-passenger zodiacs for special excursions and a 12-passenger Wider 32-foot super yacht tender for special boating adventures. Additionally, at the guests' fingertips are water skis, wake boards, kayaks, jet skis, fishing, and snorkel equipment.\nAll-inclusive cruise fares for Crystal Esprit's Mediterranean/Adriatic Coast voyages start at $3,920 when booked by October 30 . The yacht's complete selection of itineraries through the beginning of 2018 are available for viewing at www.crystalyachtcruises.com .\nCrystal Cruises is the world's most awarded luxury cruise line, having earned more \"World's Best\" accolades than any other cruise line, hotel, or resort in history. Crystal Cruises has won \"World's Best Cruise Ship\" in Conde Nast Traveler's Reader Choice Awards for 21 years; been voted \"World's Best Large Ship Cruise Line\" by Travel + Leisure readers for 20 consecutive years; and the \"Best Luxury Cruise Line\" by Virtuoso for two-consecutive years (2014 & 2015). In summer 2015, Crystal embarked on the most significant brand expansion in the history of luxury travel and hospitality, which will introduce three new classes of cruising – Crystal Yacht Cruises ( December 2015 ), Crystal River Cruises ( March 2017 ), Crystal Exclusive Class Ocean Cruises (late 2018)– and Crystal Luxury Air (fall 2017).
