The inaugural game was a tremendous success, and we hope to build on that by creating a wonderful VIP package for any college football enthusiast and their family. This package allows stress-free travel to The Bahamas as everything is taken care of -- from VIP tickets to the Bowl to transfers, to all-inclusive food and beverages at one of the top luxurious resorts in Nassau. The game proved last year that it was true destination event that fans across the country want to attend and support, and we hope that the Popeyes Bahamas Bowl package will make this easier,” said Greg Rolle, former Olympian, Chief Pilot and Senior Director of Sports Marketing and Sales for The Bahamas Ministry of Tourism. \nWhile it is too early in the season to tell who will be battling it out in the Popeyes Bowl, the 2014 game featured Western Kentucky of Conference USA against Central Michigan of the MAC in the first FBS-level bowl game outside of the United States or Canada since 1937. The Hilltoppers held on for a 49-48 victory over the Chippewas in one of the most memorable bowl games of the 2014 season. WKU built a 49-14 lead after three quarters, but CMU rallied with a 34-point fourth quarter, including a last-gasp, 75-yard, three-lateral pass play that resulted in a touchdown as time expired -- a sequence that was named the top play of the 2014 bowl season by ESPN's SportsCenter and was nominated for an ESPY award earlier this year. The first broadcast of the Popeyes Bahamas Bowl had over 110 million viewers tuning in to watch the event on Christmas Eve.
