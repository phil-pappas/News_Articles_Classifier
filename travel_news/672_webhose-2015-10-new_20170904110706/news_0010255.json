It feels so good to jump off the raft into Emily Bay, Norfolk Island. Picture: Zach Sanders \nWith a population of just over 1300, and only about 600 tourists on the island at any one time, it is isolated, remote and utterly unique. So this is what a bird feels like, it’s incredible. Picture: Lauren Bath \nThen I arrive at the tiny, white air terminal, and start noticing what an oddly lovely place this is — where the Australian and Norfolk Island flags fly side by side, the locals have their own language (a blend of ancient Tahitian and English), Australian currency is used, where the shops advertise tax-free shopping and people don’t call it fishing; but “catching” because you don’t have to try very hard — there are so many fish. It’s time for some fish to swim onto our rods. Picture: Zach Sanders \nNorfolk Island, one of Australia’s most remote communities and also one of \nits oldest, defies easy categorisation. It’s simultaneously an island paradise as well as a rocky outcrop with a rich, strange history that includes tragic deaths, shipwrecks and use as a penal settlement. It’s possibly the most haunted place in Australia, according to Richard Davies, author of the Ghost Guide to Australia, with more ghosts per square kilometres than any other state or territory. Seeing the view from up in a Moreton Bay fig. Picture: Zach Sanders \nNo matter where you are on this 8x5km island, layers of dark history unfold before you. From 1825 to 1854, it housed a British penal settlement where punishments were so vindictive it was known as the Hell of the Pacific. The prison closed, and Norfolk began a very different story from 1856 — when it became the new home for 194 relocated Pitcairn Islanders, descendants of Fletcher Christian’s Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions. \nThe historic Kingston precinct on the island’s south coast at Kingston — in addition to the stories of whale-hunting mutineers and Polynesian seafarers, who first visited these shores in 1150 — make for incredible sightseeing.

A short drive from here you’ll find the island’s cemetery — a picturesque place with a water view and headstones that provide detailed evidence of convict revolts and the lifestyle of the island’s early inhabitants. The headstone at the Norfolk Island cemetery reveal the many tragic ways men and women met their death.

Two Chimneys Winery has delicious wines and their generous platters are made up of local produce. A standout restaurant is Norfolk Blue, which specialises in a unique breed of cattle, Norfolk Blue, which it grows on the adjacent farm, and Dino’s at Bumboras, located in a gorgeous 1880s home and surrounded by a pretty garden, is delightful. It serves seafood just plucked from the ocean and homegrown herbs and vegetables. You don’t go hungry on Norfolk Island. Picture: Flickr/Zach Sanders \nAfter three days on this island I’ve fallen in love with it. \nIn his journal Cook described Norfolk Island as “paradise”— a word he did not use for any of his other discoveries. I believe that Cook could not have chosen a more apt description. It’s never too hard to find a quiet place to take a dip on the island.
