The summaries and transportation information below cover all five civilian airports in the Netherlands. 1. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol \nSchiphol is not only the Netherlands' principal airport -- it's the fifth most trafficked airport in Europe. Located in Haarlemmermeer, a municipality that borders the city of Haarlem, travelers who land at Schiphol can avail themselves of the convenient Dutch Railways (NS) service that connects the airport to Amsterdam Central Station in 15 minutes. Pros of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol • Schiphol is the most convenient civilian airport to Amsterdam.• The Rijksmuseum has a small exhibition center past airport security; M.C. Escher's \"Metamorphosis III\" also adorns the airport's walls. Cons of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol • Substantial airport taxes and fees make Schiphol a less affordable choice for travelers; some major low-cost carriers operate from the Netherlands' smaller airports instead. More » 2. Eindhoven Airport \nEindhoven Airport is the Dutch hub for several European low-cost airlines. Its location in North Brabant makes it relatively far from Amsterdam -- by Dutch standards, at least. The airport can be reached by NS train (via Utrecht; approx. 90 minutes) and Hermes bus 401 (from Eindhoven Station; approx. 30 minutes). Pros of Eindhoven Airport • Some dozen low-cost air carriers -- such as Ryanair, Transavia and Wizz Air -- operate via Eindhoven Airport. Cons of Eindhoven Airport 3. Rotterdam The Hague Airport \nRotterdam The Hague Airport handles just one million travelers per year, primarily customers of the seven low-cost airlines that operate via the airport. Its location in the Randstad and relative proximity to Amsterdam make it a convenient spot to land. Take bus 33 to Rotterdam Central Station, then the NS train to Amsterdam (approx. 30 minutes each). Pros of Rotterdam The Hague Airport • Rotterdam is only airport beside Schiphol that's located in the Randstad, the urban heart of the Netherlands. Cons of Rotterdam The Hague Airport • Only a limited number of airlines serve Rotterdam Airport. More » 4. Maastricht Aachen Airport \nOver a quarter-million flyers used Maastricht Aachen Airport in 2010 for popular Dutch holiday destinations, but service will soon expand to London, Berlin, Munich ... and Amsterdam, which can just as well be reached in three hours by NS train. Take Veolia bus 59 to Beek (approx. 10 minutes), then the NS train to Amsterdam (via Roermond; approx. 2.5 hours). More » 5. Groningen Airport Eelde \nOnly three airlines -- BMI, Corendon and Transavia -- land on the two runways of this miniature airport in Eelde. But visitors from Aberdeen, Antalya or insular Europe will find it useful to know that Amsterdam is only three hours away: take Qbuzz bus 51 to Groningen Central Station (approx. 25 minutes), then the NS train to Amsterdam (via Amersfoort; approx. 2.5 hours).
