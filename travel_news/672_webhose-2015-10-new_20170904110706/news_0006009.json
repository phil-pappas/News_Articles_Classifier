The palatial, 13th-century Chateau de Bagnols—the standard setter for luxury in town—encompasses an Espa-branded spa, a hammam, lavender gardens, a Roman pool, and an endless array of brocade silks, all surrounded by a moat and drawbridge. Rooms are equally fit for royalty, with marble baths, fine Swiss linens, and silver serving ware (even for your bedside water carafe). Use it as a launch pad for days in Lyon (just 20 miles away) or soft adventures, like hot-air ballooning high above the area’s vineyards. Rooms start at $242 a night.

But now a thoroughly modern tale is unfolding, as renowned architects Patrick Jouin and Sanjit Manku have transformed the former monks’ quarters into light-flooded, neutral-toned rooms with expansive French doors that open onto cloistered courtyards outside. Clean, geometric lines and giant art installations add a bold dash of attitude in the arcades and public spaces—which include a breakfast area, bar, and an ambitious restaurant by Bocuse d’Or winner Thibaut Rugger. Rooms start $201 a night.

Guests have full access to three pools, wine tastings with the property sommelier, a Pierre Gagnaire-helmed restaurant, and sprawling outdoor terraces perched above the town’s ancient-looking cobblestone buildings. And the rooms? Expect an alluring mix of country charms (ornate woodwork, clawfoot tubs) and contemporary comforts (large dressing areas, Sisley bath amenities). Reservations can be made via email.

Once a medieval settlement, it comprises five buildings and a restaurant on 20 sprawling acres of land—all lovingly restored from near-ruins and filled up with pieces by Tom Dixon, Ilse Crawford, and their high-design contemporaries. Also a draw: the on-site restaurant, where Mulder makes use of the hyper-local bounty, from fish and seafood harvested on the Normandy coast to 'eau d'une île' beer, brewed by a local character named Bernie. Rooms, reserved via email, start at $103 a night. Photo courtesy of D'Une Ile See More of The Best French Countryside ResortsLess a hotel than a restaurant with rooms, this labor of love by legendary chef Joël Robuchon and wine magnate Bernard Magrez is every bit as elegant and refined as you’d expect: grand spiral staircases, silk wall coverings, and an expansive wine cellar filled with 250-plus local labels. Every element of service—be it in the dining room or in the six rooms upstairs—has been thoughtfully considered, from the Christofle cutlery to the Hermès bath amenities. And when you’re a guest of Magrez’s, the VIP treatment is no small perk. Here, wine tours can be done via helicopter or Rolls Royce, or with the company of a running coach—whichever you prefer. Rooms start at $335 a night.

But you’ll have to pay a pretty penny to stay here—and bring along as many friends as you can. The property is for exclusive use only, and sleeps a whopping 54 people. Rates start at $4,000 a night.

On the property’s expansive grounds: polo fields and a full-length equestrian racetrack, gardens designed by Louis XIV’s once-principal gardener, and a phenomenal restaurant by French chef Arnaud Faye, a protégé of Michel Roth and Thierry Marx. Rooms start at $318. Photo: Christophe Bielsa  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:39:38.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
