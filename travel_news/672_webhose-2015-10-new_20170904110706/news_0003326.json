But with school half-term holidays falling in the middle of the month, parents have the opportunity to whisk their children to a destination where the sun shines in earnest. This may cause crowded beaches in popular places, but with the Caribbean at its hottest and driest, there is plenty of time for travellers without offspring to find their own escape zone. Easter has an early slot in the 2016 calendar, meaning that Mardi Gras – always an excuse for trips to hot places – will bring its noise and clamour to the second week of February. 19C-24C Sharm El Sheikh Max temp: 21C Hours of sunshine per day: 9 Sea temp: 21C Egypt has lost much of its sheen in the eyes of holidaymakers since the first burst of the “Arab Spring” five years ago, but the beach retreats of Sharm El Sheikh remain open to the public – and, unlike the hotels of sibling resort area Taba, are not currently subject to Foreign and Commonwealth travel warnings . ITC Luxury Travel (01244 355 600; itcluxurytravel.co.uk ) offers breaks at the Four Seasons – a five-star complex with a spa, and restaurants offering Mediterranean, Asian and Italian fare. Seven-night stays in February cost from £1179 per person (two sharing) – with flights, transfers and breakfast. New Orleans Max temp: 19C Hours of sunshine per day: 6 Sea temp: 18C The impatient date in the diary for Mardi Gras – Shrove Tuesday falls on February 9 in 2016 – means an opportunity to sample New Orleans’s biggest party at a juncture when the city is not drowning in the sweltering humidity that can make it so uncomfortable in hotter months. New Orleans comes alive at Mardi Gras Of course, there is more to this wild social celebration than a single day of fervour, and street parades will begin on a regular basis as early as January 29 (details at mardigrasneworleans.com ). A seven-night break at the Hyatt French Quarter – at the heart of the matter on Iberville Street – flying from Heathrow via Houston on February 4, costs £1178 a head (two sharing), room only, via Expedia (0330 1231235; expedia.co.uk ). San Diego Max temp: 20C Hours of sunshine per day: 8 Sea temp: 15C The southernmost metropolis in California will be the warmest dot on the glittering map of America’s “Golden State” in February, just keeping to the low 20s – making it a feasible place for half-term with children who can handle eight hours of time difference. San Diego provides plenty for both families and couples on an active break Photo: ALAMY Any jet-lag will, however, be eased by the city’s family-friendly attractions – San Diego Zoo with its exotic residents; Belmont Park and its antique wooden rollercoasters; coastal crescents like Mission Beach. A seven-night holiday for a family of four (two children aged 2-11), flying from Heathrow on February 13, staying at the four-star Westin San Diego, costs £3445 in all (room only), via Last Minute (0800 083 4000; lastminute.com ). 25C-29C St Lucia Max temp: 28C Hours of sunshine per day: 8 Sea temp: 26C This crucial gemstone in the necklace of the Lesser Antilles is one of the Caribbean’s most striking outcrops – thanks to the inimitable shape of its two signature bluffs, Gros and Petit Piton. Gros Piton, St Lucia Photo: Alamy February temperatures in the upper 20s also help to make St Lucia’s case – as do beaches on Pigeon Island in the north, and the revered Anse Chastanet in the west. Caribtours (020 7751 0660; c aribtours.co.uk ) sells holidays that let you stare at the latter – from Jade Mountain, a five-star palace with spa. An indulgent seven-night break in February costs from £4195 a head (two sharing) – with flights, breakfast and transfers. Rio de Janeiro Max temp: 29C Hours of sunshine per day: 7 Sea temp: 26C Like New Orleans, Brazil’s most famous city will don sequins and feathers in the first flushes of February, for its Mardi Gras extravaganza. Take in the spectacle in Rio for Carnival The Rio Carnival (February 5-9; see rio-carnival.net ) will see the home of Ipanema and Christ the Redeemer subsumed in samba rhythms and costumed noise, under skies preening in upper 20s heat. Hotel rooms sell out, so book early. Travelocity (001 855 214 7215; travelocity.com ) suggests a seven-night break at the five-star Windsor Atlantica, on the lip of Copacabana Beach, flying from Heathrow on February 4. From £1620 a head (two sharing) – with breakfast. Oman Max temp: 26C Hours of sunshine per day: 9 Sea temp: 24C The United Arab Emirates’ neighbour enjoys the same mid-20s warmth in February as Abu Dhabi and Dubai – while projecting more of an air of refinement than the latter. The Jabal Al Akhba mountain landscape Muscat certainly sees itself as an artistic city – home to an ornate opera house, plus the contemporary paintings at Ghalya’s Museum of Modern Art. The Omani capital is part of “From the Desert to the Coast” – a seven-day group adventure offered by Undiscovered Destinations (0191 296 2674; undiscovered-destinations.com) which also ticks off the dunes of Wahiba Sands, and Jebel Shams – “the Grand Canyon of Oman”. One departure is slated for February 7 – priced from £1775 per person, including flights and most meals. Seychelles Max temp: 29C Hours of sunshine per day: 6 Sea temp: 29C The idea of a “Lost World” is implausible in 2015, but this chain of Indian Ocean islands does a sterling impression of an escapee from an Arthur Conan Doyle novel – all lush tropical foliage and glamourous remoteness. It is renowned as a honeymoon haven – but you do not need to be a newly-wed to appreciate its welcoming February weather, nor the splendour of some of its hotels. Just Seychelles (01342 547 001; justseychelles.com ) can arrange breaks at the five-star Banyan Tree Seychelles, on the main island Mahé. Seven-night holidays in February cost from £2515 per person – including flights and breakfast. 30C and up Gambia Max temp: 32C Hours of sunshine per day: 8 Sea temp: 22C This miniscule fraction of West Africa ranks as the smallest country on the mainland of the continent – a narrow wedge of land on either side of the Gambia River, swallowed by the wider context of Senegal. Palm trees on Bakau beach But size does not prevent it from searing in 30C heat haze in February – or from lurking a practical six hours’ flying time from the UK. The Gambia Experience (01489 866 939; gambia.co.uk ) sells sojourns to the Coco Ocean Resort – a five-star retreat with spa, next to the beach in Bijilo. A seven-night break, departing from Manchester on February 13, costs from £1226 per person, with breakfast. A break for a family of four, departing Manchester on the same day for half-term fun, is £4904 in total. Langkawi Max temp: 34C Hours of sunshine per day: 8 Sea temp: 28C Tucked so far into the north of Malaysia that it practically clips the border with Thailand, Langkawi is an island oasis, floating in the Andaman Sea – and in temperatures that crash through the 30C-barrier in February. Relax on a beach in Langkawi, Malaysia Here is a destination for elegant down-time – not least at The Datai , its most exclusive hideaway. Cleveland Collection (020 7843 3531; clevelandcollection.co.uk ) proffers breaks at this five-star paradise. Its 14-day “Colonial Malaysia & Beach” itinerary combines seven nights at the hotel with a further week exploring Kuala Lumpur and Malacca, from £1795 per person, with flights and breakfast. Sri Lanka Max temp: 31C Hours of sunshine per day: 9 Sea temp: 28C Like its geographical colleague India, Sri Lanka has long shaken off the madness of the monsoon season by the time the new year emerges – and February is an excellent month to wander an island rich in maps and legends. Climbing Sigariya is a highlight of a trip to Sri Lanka Photo: Alamy Journeys Of Distinction (0161 491 7616; jod.uk.com ) serves up “The Very Best of Sri Lanka” – a 16-day group adventure which calls at the ancient rock fortress of Sigiriya, the old British hill station of Nuwara Eliya, and south-coast Galle, with its echoes of Portuguese and Dutch settlement. A departure is scheduled for February 16 – from £3,495 a head (two sharing), with flights and breakfast.
