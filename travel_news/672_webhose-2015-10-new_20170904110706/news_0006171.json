Expected to welcome its first guests January 1, 2016, the Julius Tower is the latest piece of a $1 billion investment, cementing Caesars Palace as the premier resort at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. \nDrawing from Roman history, the name of the new Julius Tower pays homage to Julius Caesar, the first and perhaps most widely known of all the Caesars. He was a pivotal figure in ancient Rome, credited with laying the foundation for the Roman Empire. Fittingly, the new Julius Tower represents a rebirth of the original tower at Caesars Palace, around which the legendary casino resort has expanded into its own Las Vegas Empire. Today, Julius Tower is located at the heart of Caesars Palace, with easy access to the casino floor and all of the resort's world-class amenities. \n\"As we enter into our milestone golden anniversary year, we continue to reinvent Romeâ€¦and Las Vegas,\" said Gary Selesner, Caesars Palace regional president.
