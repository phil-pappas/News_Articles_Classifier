Woody Wilson , a syndicated comic strip writer and founder/president of the nonprofit Lakeshore Music Inc., teamed with a Seattle arts executive to launch the nonprofit company Cuba Rhythms & Views Tour. After three years of planning and developing business relationships with Cubans, a Tempe… more JOCK FISTICK “We are competing with big companies who have a lot more marketing clout than we do, but I think we’re on the right track because we offer a solid market niche,” said Wilson. “We are not your typical Cuban tour. Our tours are about the fine arts and the cultural life, which is very different.” Featuring a mix of jazz and classical music programs and the fine arts (including a rehearsal of the Nacional Ballet de Cuba), Rhythm & Views appeals to arts aficionados. And its cultural experiences are in private homes, intimate performance spaces, concert halls and Cuba’s leading arts schools. “We are doing business with people who make a living from the arts in Cuba,” said Wilson, who oversees Lakeshore Music’s concert series at Tempe Center for the Arts, and also writes the \" Rex Morgan , M.D.\" and \" Judge Parker \" comic strips. Although visiting Cuba is still restricted on a limited basis and you can’t legally do business there, the tours are allowed through various categories of the “People to People” programs. Wilson said developing the tour company has taken several years of trial and error of not only doing business within Cuba, but with the U.S. government. A case in point is the confusing nature of the embargo. “For example, we had to set up the bank account in the United States and had to keep reassuring the American bank that the money doesn’t go to the Cuban government, but goes to promoting the cultural exchange and support the arts in Cuba.” The evolution of Wilson’s new venture began after he attended a concert in Cuba in 2012 of the Orchestra Concierto Sur sponsored by the Tempe Chamber of Commerce. He discovered the orchestra was coming to the U.S. as part of a cultural exchange with the Northwest Sinfonietta in Seattle. Wilson teamed with NWS’s Executive Director Neil Birnbaum to try and extend that to include a performance at the Tempe Center for the Arts. After much negotiation with both the U.S. State Department and the Cuban government, the appropriate visas were arranged. To date, Rhythm & Views has a small staff of liaisons in Cuba coordinating the events, and others in Miami to book the flights and obtain visas. “We want to inspire our patrons and make sure they’re comfortable and put them up in the best accommodations and eat in the finest paladars in the old world city of Havana,” said Wilson of the tour prices ranging from $3,750 to $5,000. There are four upcoming trips for 20- 30 travelers on Dec. 9-17, May 18-26 and Nov 30-Dec 6, 2016. On the Jan. 26-Feb 3 trip, they’ll take a group to accompany eminent Chilean conductor Maximiano Valdés, who will conduct the Orquesta Nacional de Cuba.
