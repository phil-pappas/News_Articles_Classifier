If the Finns featured in \"Tango Finlandia\" seemed grim, Huhtala-jenks says they had reason to be that way.\nThe Finland of the 1990s was \"quite a different world,\" she says.\n\"Finland was under Soviet 'influence' for a very long time and the collapse of the Soviet Union had only happened a few years back.\"\nThrow in high alcohol consumption, troubling suicide rates and a national economic depression and it was \"no wonder people weren't too happy.\"\nBut does the Land of a Thousand Lakes (despite the nickname, it's closer to a land of nearly 200,000 lakes) remain a place where sorrow abounds?\n\"I don't think it's true.\"\nConceding, \"we're still not great in small talk,\" Huhtala-jenks insists that doesn't mean \"we're extremely shy, overtly depressed or melancholic.\"\nShe acknowledges Finns can seem despondent to outsiders, which she blames largely on a few missing words.\nHuhtala-jenks's husband is Irish.\nWhen they first started dating, she would \"drive him nuts as I wouldn't use the words 'please' or 'excuse me'. He'd find it extremely rude.\"\nLuckily, she has an excellent excuse: Finns don't have those words.\n\"Those words simply don't exist in our language and hence using them does not come naturally.\"\nSunshine and darkness\nNights like this make everything better. Her husband also committed a cultural faux pas.\nHuhtala-jenks was annoyed when he started talking before she finished.\n\"For Finns, it is extremely rude to interrupt someone. This leads to us making pauses or taking our time to talk.\"\nThus foreigners may interpret this basic display of Finnish silence/politeness as being \"shy or rude or even depressed.\"\nTo summarize: for many nationalities a conversation where no one says \"please\" and there are long pauses is troubling; in Finland it's par for the course.\nWhich isn't to say everything's sunshine.\n\"We're currently in one of our worst recessions,\" Huhtala-jenks says, noting the suicide rate remains high and the heavy drinking can still be worrying.\nBeyond this, there are aspects of Finnish life in general that can be described as bleak.\nA recent Finnish National Gallery's exhibition \" The Magic North \" on late 19th/early 20th century Finnish/Norwegian art had a heavy emphasis on the dark (parts of Finland experience 24 hours of it daily in the winter), the cold (temperatures can drop as low as -50 degrees Celsius/-58 Fahrenheit) and artists like Hugo Simberg, responsible for such cheerful masterworks as \"The Wounded Angel\" and \"The Garden of Death.\"\nBeyond this, Huhtala-jenks acknowledges some Finns still \"will never say 'hi' or look you in the eye,\" though she contends many others are \"overtly chatty, friendly and open.\"\nHeavy metal happiness\nOf course, the most important question still needs to be answered: What about the tango?\nThankfully, that's correct, both then and now.\n\"It is still popular in Finland: every year a tango king and queen are chosen.\"\nIt has, however, been surpassed by another form of music outsiders might not expect.\nRecent visitors to Helsinki would've spotted scores of posters for a appearance by the legendary English rock band Motorhead.\nIt's no surprise the city offers a warm welcome to Lemmy Kilmister.\n\"Finland is the heavy metal capital of the world,\" Huhtala-jenks declares, which is true by her definition of \" most metal bands per inhabitant .\"\nShe credits this for some of the nation's improved spirits.\n\"You'd think this makes us depressed and gloomy, but the latest studies show that metal heads are some of the calmest and happiest people.\"\nHuhtala-jenks should know -- she proudly describes herself as \"a complete metal head.\"\nBrush up on your Black Sabbath albums and return for an update ASAP, Mr. Safer.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134316-0904-810j74fm-vastavalo-391493-9038-super-169.jpg", "http://www.ateneum.fi/en/magic-north", "http://www.econ.umn.edu/~tkehoe/papers/Finland.pdf", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgcyf11Lgao", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134454-iceswimming-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134454-iceswimming-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134454-iceswimming-medium-plus-169.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fgcyf11Lgao", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134454-iceswimming-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134316-0904-810j74fm-vastavalo-391493-9038-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134316-0904-810j74fm-vastavalo-391493-9038-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134316-0904-810j74fm-vastavalo-391493-9038-large-169.jpg", "http://www.euronews.com/2015/07/02/finland-tops-european-countries-in-latest-happiness-survey/", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2013/11/12/map_of_heavy_metal_bands_by_country.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134454-iceswimming-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134454-iceswimming-super-169.jpg", "http://www.worldlifeexpectancy.com/cause-of-death/suicide/by-country/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134316-0904-810j74fm-vastavalo-391493-9038-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134454-iceswimming-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134316-0904-810j74fm-vastavalo-391493-9038-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151013134316-0904-810j74fm-vastavalo-391493-9038-small-11.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:28:31.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
