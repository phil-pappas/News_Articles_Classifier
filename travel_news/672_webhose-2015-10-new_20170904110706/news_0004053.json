You're now part of an elite, very exclusive club of Britain’s 30 million drivers . As you set off into this new phase of life, here are 10 things that you know to be true... 1. You miss your driving instructor You wanted to ram your car into the back of a lorry whenever they made a sarcastic remark. But you now miss their calm authority and the confidence they gave you. 2. OK, you mostly miss their set of pedals “just in case” 3. P-plates are useless in a city Thought you got constantly honked at while you were in your learner car? Just see how drivers in Croydon react to your wimpy P-plates. No sympathy, whatsoever. Go without. 4. It’s not the end of your lessons You still have so much to find out. This means that every journey is an adventure, even if it’s an adventure that ends with you paying £5 for an hour’s parking. 5. Parking bays are a terrifying challenge In the test centre you were guaranteed to have at least one free bay on either side. And now you’re at Newport Pagnell services during your first motorway drive and you need to squeeze between a Range Rover and a van while your amused friends look on. 6. The freedom you have is amazing You could go on a spontaneous road trip from Land’s End to John o’Groats, or rent a van and explore Europe. OK, you’re probably just going to drive to see your aunt in Aberdeen, but still. Freedom! 7. Filling up a car with petrol is quite exciting Doesn’t matter if you’re a teenager or a pensioner, this does feel like proper responsible behaviour. But it’s not like paying a gas bill because you get to buy a Lion bar afterwards. 8. Talking about car upholstery, specific petrol stations or bank holiday traffic in any depth makes you sound like Alan Partridge There are lots of great things about suburbia – discount outlets, for example. But you manage to steer clear of this pub-car-park-in-Berkshire conversation. You were a non-driver so recently that you know talking about the merits and demerits of an Astra is alienating and quite profoundly dull. “It's amazing the number of people who still think the petrol cap to a Ford Focus is on the offside rear.” 9. But bank holiday traffic is really bad Despite all the above, something changes. As your knowledge of roads and bizarre motorist behaviour deepens, you find yourself wanting to talk about it. Your low point comes when you corner someone who once drove in Europe to ask them dozens of questions about the intricacies of driving on the “wrong side of the road”. Back of the net. 10. The first proper trip you take will probably be to Ikea/Homebase/similar You get the double joy of arguing with your partner when you miss your exit from the dual carriageway and having the inevitable row about flat-packed furniture. Congratulations, you’re an adult. At least you don’t have to carry your new shelves home on the bus. Spend more time laughing and less time worrying behind the wheel. With the AA on your side, you're covered when the unpredictable happens.
