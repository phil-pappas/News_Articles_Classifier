In light of Thanksgiving celebrations this weekend, here are some places I think we should all be thankful for. \nANYWHERE IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR \nWith only a few exceptions, every person I have ever met from Newfoundland and Labrador has offered to give me the parka off their back. These people have had a tough life. Yet they’re generous and upbeat as all get out. They also don’t take well to folks who register too high on the uppity meter. You can’t beat St. John’s for its harbour setting and colourful walkways out along the Battery. Gros Morne is truly one of Canada’s best national parks, with tremendous hiking and an iconic boat trip up Western Brook Pond. \nNORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR, ONTARIO \nThe drive from Thunder Bay down to Sault Ste. Marie passes truly magnificent scenery and long lake views with hardly a soul around. Hop on a boat in the village of Rockport and take a tour out past the many islands that dot this part of Lake Superior. Take in the Winnie the Pooh park and display in White River and be sure to pay your respects to the giant Wawa Goose . The Lake Superior trip would be a perfect drive if they only had more places to pull over for photos and more Tim Hortons. \nANYWHERE ON THE COAST OF BRITISH COLUMBIA \nI love Tofino as much as the next person who loves long walks on the beach and surfing and whale watching. I also love the Sunshine Coast , which might be the most underrated part of the province with its quiet, pristine bays and wonderful hiking and kayaking opportunities. Another nice spot is Sooke , just west of Victoria on Vancouver Island. \nTHE PRAIRIES \nYou might be surprised by the sophistication of Saskatoon, which is home to the truly excellent Ayden Kitchen and Bar restaurant and the super-fun theatre group Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan . Winnipeg is also a city on the rise, with a new hockey arena and a growing number of folks flocking to downtown condos and apartments. The Canadian Museum for Human Rights is a beauty. \nILES DE LA MADELEINE, QUEBEC \nThe Magdalen Islands have beaches that stretch on approximately forever. There also are surprisingly steep hills, often plunging straight down to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. I loved my short visits to La Butte Ronde and Havre Sur Mer , both fine B&Bs. \nYUKON \nI have not made it to Dawson City, but I spent a week here a few years back, setting up shop in the village of Haines Junction and exploring Kluane National Park . I saw more moose and bears along the side of the road than I saw cars in a four-hour drive and I got to listen to the sound of the ice cracking at lovely Kathleen Lake. I also fell in love with the adventurous spirit of the people of Whitehorse. \nCAPE BRETON, NOVA SCOTIA \nThe Cabot Trail truly is one of the world’s great drives: a swooping, swirling ribbon of road clinging to the side of steep cliffs overlooking the sea. South of Mabou you will find a pretty road that leads to a provincial park with a great beach and lovely views of the coast and hills. I also love the powerful views when you venture off the north end of the trail along White Point Road. Look for live music at the Red Shoe Pub in Mabou and awesome golf at both Cabot Links and the new Cabot Cliffs . \nTHE ALBERTA ROCKIES \nThe Icefields Parkway between Jasper and Banff might be the most majestic drive on the planet, with towering spires of ancient rock and clouds swirling in the blue western sky. Try a comparison gondola experience by riding to the tops of the mountains in Jasper, Lake Louise and Banff. Better yet, get off the road at a pull-out spot and inspect tumbling waterfalls and beautiful canyons along the way, including the sublime Athabasca Falls. © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:18:01.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
