The “Saving Sharks” exhibit opened Tuesday at the aquarium in Corpus Christi. The $325,000 exhibit allows visitors to track tagged sharks via computer. Guests can also touch bamboo and epaulette sharks, plus check out a diving cage. The exhibit also features efforts to preserve shark populations.\nThe exhibit is supported by Ocearch, the Houston Museum of Natural Science and the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.\nGreece to raise fees for cultural sites\nATHENS, Greece >> Cash-strapped Greece is planning steep increases in ticket prices for ancient sites and museums, which travel agents say could hit the country’s key tourism industry.\nThe Culture Ministry wants to raise the ticket for the Acropolis to 20 euros from 12 euros, and to double entry charges for other popular sites and museums — which all together attracted more than 6 million visitors in January-June.\nThe government says current charges are “unacceptably low.” It argues additional revenues could offset austerity measures demanded by international bailout creditors, such as higher taxation on all private education.\nThe new prices would apply from April to November 2016, with a 50 percent discount for the rest of the year.\nThe federation of Greek travel agents warned last week that the hike would drive tourists away.\nCarnival adding China cruise lines\nMIAMI >> Carnival is bringing two more of its cruise brands to China to keep up with growing demand from Chinese travelers.\nThe Carnival- and Aida-branded cruise ships will start sailing in China in 2017. The company’s other brands, Costa and Princess, are already sailing in China. Carnival first entered the Chinese market with Costa ships in 2006.\nHotels, airlines and and other U.S. travel companies have been expanding in China to cater to the growing number of Chinese travelers.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:30:37.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
