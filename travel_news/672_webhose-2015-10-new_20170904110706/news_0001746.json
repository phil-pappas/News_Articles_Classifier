By Amanda Gomez | 10/13/15 - 01:15 PM EDT Reprint \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- IBM Corp. ( IBM - Get Report ) announced it has signed a 10-year, $700 million technology services agreement with Etihad Airways in the United Arab Emirates. \nIBM will provide secure and efficient technologies to update Etihad Airways' IT infrastructure to improve its customer service and experience. \nAs part of the agreement, IBM will create a new cloud data center in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and the companies will create a technology and innovation council to develop personalized travel solutions. \nIBM will gain about 100 employees from Etihad Airways' IT department as part of the deal. \n\"These technologies will help the airline to improve efficiencies and achieve its ambitious growth plans as a globally integrated aviation group,\" IBM Global Technology Services SVP Martin Jetter said in a statement. \nAdditionally, IBM will open its first public cloud data center in India. \nThe Chennai data center is part of the company's plans to invest $1.2 billion to expand its global footprint. \n\"India's cloud market is poised for exponential growth, which makes it essential for Indian businesses to have local access to the resources and skills they need to help guarantee success,\" IBM Cloud SVP Robert LeBlanc said in a statement. \nIBM stock is declining 1.15% to $149.35 in afternoon trading on Tuesday. \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates INTL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate INTL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP (IBM) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its notable return on equity, good cash flow from operations and expanding profit margins. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the IT Services industry and the overall market, INTL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has slightly increased to $3,884.00 million or 8.52% when compared to the same quarter last year. The firm also exceeded the industry average cash flow growth rate of -2.37%. INTL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP's earnings per share declined by 15.4% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, INTL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP increased its bottom line by earning $15.66 versus $15.37 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($15.75 versus $15.66). Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 21.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues fell by 13.4%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. The gross profit margin for INTL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP is rather high; currently it is at 55.19%. Regardless of IBM's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 16.57% trails the industry average.
