Instead of hiring professional photographers, many small hotel owners take pictures of their properties using such a smart phone or tablet\nThis restaurant looks extremely dreary (left), but has been transformed by a professional photographer (right)\nAccording to new research compiled by eviivo, a booking management app for independent hotels and B&Bs, 82 per cent of Brits polled are put off solely due to terrible photography, admitting that photos are one of their top three criteria when deciding where to spend the night.\nTurns out that many prospective guests believe that bad photos equate to poor service.\n Next Astonishing pictures show Boeing 747 engine lying in a field...

But all is not lost.\nIn an effort to illustrate the importance of appealing photography - and how effectively just a few small changes can impact profit - eviivo has teamed up with celebrity interior designer, Sophie Robinson, to share her makeover expertise.\nBut celebrity interior designer, Sophie Robinson, shows how making a few small tweaks - and using a high-quality camera - can make all the difference\nSophie recommends straightening the sheets, adding a few decorative pillows and checking for any reflections in shiny surfaces\nThese before and after photographs of a hotel entryway were taken just a few minutes apart at a B&B in Brighton\nDue to heightened competition online, Sophie emphasises that it's crucial for B&B owners to promote their hotels effectively\nThe photograph on the left was taken by an inexperienced photographer on a smart phone or tablet, while the one on the right exudes professional polish\nVisiting a range of B&Bs in Brighton, Sophie and her team took two photographs of the same space only a few minutes apart.\nThe 'before' shot was taken by someone with no experience on a phone or tablet, while the 'after' equivalent was taken by a professional photographer after Sophie had set the scene.\nHowever, she wasn't allowed to bring any new objects into the room or re-decorate in anyway. She simply made minor tweaks, all of which can be achieved at home, such as adjusting the pillow arrangements, straightening the sheets and checking shiny surfaces for reflection.\nOne in three Brits polled revealed that photos are one of their top three criteria when deciding where to spend the night\nThe CEO of eviivo admits that rarely the quality of the 'before' photos accurately reflects the level of service or quality of the B&B\nWhen asked how much they would value the two rooms, the average rate per night came in at £43 for the 'before' property and £91 for the 'after' (pictured)\nThese tips can be easily and cheaply applied to any setting - and will allow owners to get the most from their online gallery\nSmall touches, such as biscuits on the side table, add a cosy touch to a room - and make it far more appealing to prospective guests\nA shocking 76 per cent revealed that they would happily stay in the property if booking solely based on the 'after' image, while just 13 per cent were keen to book having seen the 'before' photo.\nEven more interestingly, when asked how much they would value the two rooms, the average rate per night came in at £43 for the 'before' property and £91 for the 'after.'\nAnd 61 per cent were convinced that the photos were taken years apart, rather than just a few minutes.\nCleaning the bathroom thoroughly before taking photographs is crucial, as is clearing away any sort of clutter\nPoor quality photographs, such as these, are often equated with bad service - at least according to the British travellers polled\nSophie also puts particular importance on ensuring that nothing is reflected in any shiny or mirrored surfaces in the photos\nSophie Robinson explained: 'With more and more people booking accommodation online, your website with accompanying images is your virtual shop window. It is essential that you represent your B&B optimally with good photography. Pictures of rooms are often the first thing prospective guests look at and the Internet means they can compare with the competition instantly. Make your B&B steal all the appeal by posting photos that communicate style, freshness, and cosiness.'\nMichele Fitzpatrick, CEO of eviivo, added: 'B&Bs and small hotels remain true to their routes as the backbone of British hospitality where service and value is paramount. In reality, the quality of the photos does not accurately reflect the level of service nor quality of the B&B. Owners need to take on board these easy, and most importantly cheap, tips on how to get the most from their photo gallery.'\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Passenger films plane engine falling apart on take-off\nWatch video Step out onto the mysterious 5th floor Yanggakdo hotel\nWatch video Tourist takes planking craze to a new level on travelator\nWatch video Secret Retreat: UXUA Casa Hotel & Spa in Trancoso\nWatch video Chinglish: People are tested on the 'language' skills\nWatch video Make sure you don't look like a tourist with this guide\nWatch video Koko the gorilla falls in love with a litter of tiny kittens\nWatch video Woman launches scathing racist attack in heated row on bus\nWatch video White van driver bullies learner driver ON HER TEST\nWatch video Incredible moment passers-by rescue new born from bag\nWatch video Khloe Kardashian gets emotional call from Lamar Odom on KUWTK\nWatch video Chilling footage shows rapist carrying his 24-year-old victim\nSOPHIE ROBINSON'S TOP TIPS Writing in a blog post for eviivo, Sophie said: 'The way you style your photographs can make all the difference to the impression that they give your prospective guests. Here are my top tips to creating show-stopping shots.'\nTo help make the bed look more luxurious and comfy, consider turning down the top of the duvet, around 40cm, in front of the pillows, and tuck in neatly. A small vase with a couple of fresh flowers always helps make a room look fresh and clean. Consider popping one on the bedside table, breakfast table or a larger arrangement in the hallway for your photo shoot. When styling the bed it looks really inviting to have a few scatter cushions. My rule is that there should be at least two, set symmetrically for a smart yet minimal look, or three with one cushion preferably smaller than the back two. One cushion looks just mean and any more than three looks fussy. Don’t arrange your cushions like diamonds. That looks really naff! As a rule lights and lamps look better switched off. Try and get as much natural daylight into your rooms as possible before you photograph them. Shooting your rooms at night is a total no no! If the room doesn’t have much natural light, use the lamps to create a cosy glow, but that’s always a second resort. Edit out the necessary yet unaesthetic from your photos. Take away the waste paper bin, plug in heater, fan, ironing board, and piles of towels and make sure they don’t creep into your shot. Those things can be listed into your copy so your guests can expect to use them but not shown in the pictures, as they look plain ugly. Avoid showing overtly branded products in your pictures. In the bathroom use a plain bar of soap in a dish or decant your liquid hand soap into a soap pump. In the breakfast room take away packets of cereal or decant them into stylish glass jars. Photograph your rooms on a cloudy day. This avoids bright white streaks of sunlight bleaching out areas of your photograph and creating sharp shadows. A few nicely arranged tight detail shots can really add the right mood to your listing. Think about a photograph of a welcoming mug of tea with some biscuits, a collection of pretty toiletries or a posy of fresh flowers on the breakfast table to let your guest know that you also think of the smaller details. Whenever possible use plain white bed linen. This can be accessorised with a neat bed throw and cushions for interest. Before you take your photos make sure your rooms look their absolute best. Spick and span with smear free mirrors and taps, freshly laundered pressed bed linen, and every surface polished and gleaming.\nRead more: eviivo.com/bbs-a...", "external_links": ["https://eviivo.com/bbs-are-losing-out-on-8-9m-a-year-due-to-poor-photography/", "http://dailym.ai/1Rescb7", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-10-16T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:28:11.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
