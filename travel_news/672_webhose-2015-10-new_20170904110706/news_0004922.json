Shoreline's program integrates with all nine top U.S. payment processors. It allows card issuers to work with any processor they prefer while using Shoreline for EMV chip card production, personalization and fulfillment. Through the program, Shoreline has certified its payment cards and standard Durbin-compatible profiles with each processor to facilitate a quick setup and personalization of EMV credit or debit cards. Shoreline's initial back-end integration accelerates a bank's EMV timeline and simplifies the deployment of instant issuance for on-the-spot EMV card issuance. Since channels and relationships are already established with processors, customers common to a given processor can leverage resulting efficiencies to make issuance rapid from end-to-end. The EMV migration can be easily sped up by eliminating the time demands that come with replicating connections and education for each issuer, As instant issuance becomes a more popular option with regional banks and credit unions, the Shoreline Processor Ready Program is structured to work with that onsite enrollment and distribution method as well as traditional central issuance. \"Shoreline has made the ongoing investment to strengthen our partnerships with processors and become exceptionally familiar with their requirements and procedures,\" said John Roberts, Head of Sales at Shoreline . \"We are able to pass on experience and efficiency to our regional banks and credit union customers thanks to our strong relationship with processors coupled with Gemalto's extensive EMV expertise.\" About Shoreline Shoreline, a Gemalto Company, has been offering card personalization solutions and assistance to the financial industry for more than 25 years.
