Flights abandon daily and visit the top or the bottom or both. Get more info. See this article. \nA helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon, which you can take out of Las Vegas, is the most fun and comprehensive way to experience the massive landmark. But make sure you read everything before you book. Many of these tours seem to leave from Vegas but leave from close-by places like Boulder City, Henderson or even North Las Vegas. These trips are great, but for your money, the best bet is leaving straight from the Las Vegas Strip. Lights Of Vegas The nice thing about flights that depart from the Strip apart from convenience is you get a flyover of Neon Boulevard when you fly back from the Grand Canyon. You'll see the lights twinkle in the sky as you travel from Stratosphere Tower to the famous Luxor Pyramid. Other famed sights you'll see include the dancing fountains of the Bellagio, Emerald City of MGM, Paris Eiffel Tower, and the Manhattan skyline at New York-New York, just to name a few. Also, this particular tour comes with free pick up and drop off service in a limousine. That only makes any Las Vegas celebration more memorable whether it is a honeymoon, anniversary, or birthday event. Another benefit of the Strip departure tours is that they fly on EcoStar 130 choppers. The EcoStar 130 offers the best flight experience when you tour the Grand Canyon. It features a cabin 25% larger than basic tour helicopters, climate control, and comfortable stadium seating. Its advanced aerodynamics creates smooth rides while the 180-degree wrap around windshield offers incredible views. The older-style helicopters used in he basic tours aren't nearly as comfortable or as nice. Tour Options Any air tour comes with options, but the main choice is between air only tours or landing tours. While both tours fly over Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon, only landing tours take you to the canyon floor. Air only tours will fly around the National Park and then return to Vegas, so you will get to see the main canyon sights. You'll see the same sights on a landing tour but you'll also get to land on the top or bottom of the rim and get out and enjoy fun activities on foot. One tour that is really fun is one that flies down to the canyon floor where a champagne picnic is waiting for you. This tour can be upgraded to include activities such as a boat ride on the Colorado River and VIP tickets to the famous Skywalk. It is very important that you book your flight online as early as possible. Seats on Grand Canyon helicopter tours fill up fast. Plus, if you book early, you will have your flight secured and save money. Just so you don't forget, you should book your helicopter tour the same day you book your Vegas hotel. Do not try to book your tour 48 hours beforehand, you will waste money and might end up with no flight at all. When you're ready to take your tour, be sure to dress for the weather. Summertime is hot at the canyon and 100 degree temperatures are common. Wear something with breathable fabric so you stay cool. Pack sunscreen, sunglasses, water and a hat with a brim to block out the sun. If you take one of the fun landing tours, wear sturdy shoes because the canyon floor may be hard to walk on without them. Bring a salty snack to keep up your energy, there's a lot to see. Enjoy An Adventurous Flight Taking a helicopter tour that lifts off from the Strip in Vegas is the most convenient way to see the Grand Canyon as well as the most comfortable way to fly. You'll even get free limo service and a flight over Vegas. Fortunately, these tours utilize the EcoStar 130 chopper , so no matter where you sit, you'll get a great view. Since these air tours offer it all, you want to make sure to book these trips well in advance. Don't wait until the last minute and have to pay extra or worse, not even get a seat!
