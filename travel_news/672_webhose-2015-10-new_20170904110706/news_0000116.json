Van der Malen-Van der Horst has held the position of Director of Sales at Apollo Hotels & Resorts for the last three years, having joined the organisation in 2009. Under her leadership, The Hague Convention Bureau will focus on acquiring more international conferences and business events in the coming years. \nThe Supervisory Board at The Hague Marketing appointed Nienke Van der Malen-Van der Horst as new director of The Hague Convention Bureau after she emerged from an open application procedure as the most suitable candidate. In a way she is returning to the city, as she attended the Hotel School The Hague. The Hague Convention Bureau (THCB) is a separate unit within The Hague Marketing, aimed at acquiring and facilitating international conferences and business events. In 2014, the city allocated additional resources to The Hague Marketing, coupled with a challenging target increase in international conferences and business events of up to 50%. This additional budget allows THCB to strengthen its position with human resources, to grow in terms of professionalism and quality and to invest in operations and innovative methods. The economic spin-off for the greater The Hague area will be considerable. As the confirmed new director, Van der Malen-Van der Horst will take over from acting director Bruce Redor, who held the position during the recent initial expansion phase at The Hague Convention Bureau. Nienke Van der Malen-Van der Horst: ”Following an (inter)national career, it will be a tremendous step for me to apply my commercial skills towards strengthening The Hague’s position internationally. I look forward to working resolutely and energetically, together with my team and the city’s partners, to build on The Hague’s reputation as a prime congress destination.” Marco Esser, director at The Hague Marketing: “Nienke is a team player. She is energetic and goal-directed and brings plenty of managerial sales experience to the job. In her, I see a strong personality who will be ‘the face of The Hague’ when it comes to congress acquisition. I look forward to leading The Hague Marketing together with her.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:47:02.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
