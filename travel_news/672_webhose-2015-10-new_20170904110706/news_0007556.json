The 2015 festivities conclude on Nov. 1. Adrienne Cutway Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel Get your freak on at Fantasy Fest 2015 \nFantasy Fest returns to Key West for 10 days this year, and with an \"All Hallows Intergalactic Freak Show\" theme, revelers can expect to be immersed in the bizarre and peculiar. \nIf you're wondering what kind of ensemble is suited for such an affair, draw your inspiration from paganism, circus sideshows, extraterrestrials, sci-fi or horror classics. These same motifs will be applied to the custom-designed floats, costumes and more during the festival’s spate of masquerades, costume contests and parties. \nA king and queen who will preside over the celebrations will be crowned when the festivities kick off at the Royal Coronation Ball on Friday, Oct. 23. The festival reaches its peak on Halloween with a grand parade where the most creative and extravagant costumes and floats will be rewarded. \nThis year's grand marshal is Cindy Williams, known for her role as Shirley Feeney on the classic TV series “Laverne & Shirley.” While that may be her most notable role, Fantasy Fest organizers like to point out her role in the 1983 space horror comedy musical “The Creature Wasn't Nice” alongside Leslie Nielsen that makes her a perfect fit for this year's freak show Fantasy Fest theme. \n“I'm really looking forward to the spirit and camaraderie of the festival,” Williams said in a press release. “Every time I think [of] it, in my head I just see all these colors and everybody's imagination at work and all their costuming -- all that inventiveness and creativity and fun.” \nBetween the kickoff ball and the grand parade visitors can expect “Star Wars”-themed burlesque performances, a pet parade, a toga party and other more risqué events. \nBelow is a list of events happening during Fantasy Fest, you can also visit FantasyFest.com for more information. \nBelow is a list of events happening during Fantasy Fest, you can also visit FantasyFest.com for more information. \nOct. 23: Royal Coronation Ball at Southernmost Beach Café.
