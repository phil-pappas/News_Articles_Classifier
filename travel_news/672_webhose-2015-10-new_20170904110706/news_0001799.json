I have residents asking what is going on with the road and I have to say 'I don't know', I may be the mayor but they don't have to tell me. \n\"It is very frustrating.\" \nThe work will also include junction improvements, changes to nearby roads and pedestrian safety upgrades. \nImprovements to the M3 slip roads at junctions 10, 11, 12, 13 & 14 are also included in the project, along with upgrades to junctions 5 & 8 of the M27. \nAs well as a lack of clarity over the start date of the project, the Department for Transport was unable to tell the Daily Echo how long the work is expected to take when it begins. Share article \nThe stretch of the A31 between the Ashley Heath interchange and Poulner Hill sees frequent crashes of varying severity and often motorists experience long delays due to rush hour traffic. \nRecent work on the A338 has led to even longer delays for westbound traffic passing Ringwood over the past few weeks. The widening scheme is intended to help reduce congestion and get traffic flowing in the area, and is also expected to reduce air pollution around Ringwood.

Would be nice to have an interview with someone from highways construction to give us a timeline and budget from planning to completion on a project to widen the road in stages to reduce disruption at night. And I bet with some discussion it is less than 6 months. Meanwhile, plans to build another 3000 houses in next year meet with immediate approval from Councillors who are as ever completely switched on to the views and priorities of the electorate... 5 years?

Too many minor, blind, junctions and poor roadsigns. Combined with the general poor standard of driving this is just a recipe for disaster. What is needed is a complete redesign of the road layout remove some of the blind junctions and improve traffic flow .
