Victory against an Olympiakos side that had never beaten British opposition away from home in this competition and everything would have been back on course for a second-placed finish and the annual elimination in the first knock-out round. Sadly, modern Arsenal are rather like a naughty child you can't take your eyes off for a minute and that farcical defeat has left them requiring at least four, and probably six, points from Bayern Munich in the next two games. Still, European football is increasingly a distraction from the important business of qualifying for European football next season, and at least David Ospina isn't upset about a lack of first team football – every cloud. Dynamo Kiev v Chelsea (19.45) Uefa Champions League Group Stage, BT Sport 2 VM 532/528 HD, 19.00 Things aren't going a great deal better for Chelsea who were beaten at Porto last time out and need a trip to Kiev like the world needs an autobiography from Sam Allardyce. Mind you, Chelsea would struggle to beat Brigg Town at the moment and they've got to play somebody. A European trip removes the possibility that defeat will be down to a conspiracy by the FA and Premier League referees, but adds a whole new cornucopia of airline pilots, baggage attendants, hotel receptionists and team coordinators who can be blamed should Jose Mourinho's team underperform and be tactically picked apart for the ninth time this season already.

The hard-fought win in Monchengladbach looks to have made it a straight fight between City and Sevilla for second and while that should play well for the English side, the Spaniards have been specialists in the Europa League for several seasons now while City travel as well as an agoraphobic claustrophobe with a fear of heights and airline food. CSKA Moscow v Man Utd (19.45) Uefa Champions League Group Stage, BT Sport Europe VM 532/529 HD, 19.00 Man Utd have also won one and lost one so far, but have a kinder group than others and should still progress even allowing for whatever the Russian winter has in store for them in this one. Added consideration – the Manchester derby follows just four days later.

Doesn't say a lot for Sion that he could ride out being taken to penalties by Carlisle United but a draw with them was deemed a disaster too far. So now we get a second big thick slice of Klopp of the week for ourselves. The Europa League group stage never seemed so interesting – seriously. Anderlecht v Tottenham Hotspur (18.00) Uefa Europa League Group Stage, BT Sport Europe VM 532/529 HD, 18.00 Tottenham are around while you're probably still at work to serve as build up to that one. If their 3-1 win against mighty Qarabag and draw against colossal Monaco whetted your appetite, then you'll be hungry for this clash against medium-sized Anderlecht.

He left the club after two successive victories to be replaced by Neil Redfearn who, while undoubtedly badly done to at Leeds where he'd overseen a slew of talented academy graduates before being eaten alive by the Massimo Cellino circus, doesn't look like a man with the experience to cope with the situation he's inherited here. Time will tell. Likewise for Sheffield Wednesday, under new foreign ownership and management this season and offering few consistent clues as to their future direction so far. Last season Wednesday equalised four minutes from time in this local derby only to concede again from the kick off and then bang in two more themselves in injury time. Those who left in the eighty fifth minute at 1-0 no doubt surprised to arrive home and find the final score at 2-3. Surely worth a couple of hours of your time.

Everton have one season on, and one season off, and look like they're in one of their good years with only one defeat so far at the time of going to press. Too many stalemates though, and with Arsenal's propensity to try and score only the perfect goals a betting man may be tempted to hand Ray Winstone's fat floating head a score on a draw. Mind you, this column isn't known for its hot tips. Blackburn Rovers v Burnley (12.30) Championship, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, Sky Sports 5 VM 516/506 HD 12.00 Not the firmest of friends these two, which is a bit like saying Tom and Jerry had an uneasy flat share arrangement. The police have, on occasions, designated this as a bubble match meaning you were only allowed in if you agreed to get onto designated coaches at either Ewood Park or Turf Moor and be taken to the other ridiculously early and parked in the away end to wait for kick off. Tremendous stories about Burnley supporters who live over the road from their fiercest rivals having to drive to Burnley to come back to their house on the bus did the rounds. On the field there's been a change of the guard. Burnley, lower league dwellers on the financial rocks while Jack Walker was bankrolling Rovers' Premier League glory years, are now looking good for an immediate return to the big time under inspirational manager Sean Dyche. Blackburn, meanwhile, continue to labour under an ongoing transfer embargo for breaching FFP regulations, hugging tightly onto Jordan Rhodes as their final asset.

This didn't need any extra needle, but the arrival of former (briefly) Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce in the home dug out will certainly add plenty to it. Newcastle one of three quarters of a million chips on Big Sam's shoulder, if his recently released autobiography is anything to go by. The ghost writer definitely missed a trick not finishing each chapter with \"needless to say I had the last laugh\", such was the comedic, mockumentary style of the whole thing. It is, at the time of writing, a battle between the bottom two teams in the division. Newcastle will sooner or later realise the manager isn't the problem with their club, though probably not before Steve McClaren has been handed his cards. Sunderland seem happy to new-manager-bounce their way to survival each year – remarkably, the Mackems haven't won a league game in the first two months of the season for three years, and have only won three times in August and September in the last six seasons. They do, however, beat Newcastle religiously – five wins on the spin prior to this one. Man Utd v Man City (14.05) Premier League, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, 14.00 Uber Duper Sunday* then switches quickly to Manchester where both sides will have to recover quickly from their midweek European exertions/disappointments and be ready to face down each other in the match that will decide once and for all (well, until March 19) who is the champion side in the city. Expect the term \"noisy neighbours\" to be grossly over-used. Liverpool v Southampton (16.15) Premier League, Sky Sports 1 VM 512/502 HD, 16.05 The Day of Destiny* concludes with Liverpool, who take great Southampton players and turn them into mediocre passengers, facing Southampton, who take hidden gems from elsewhere and turn them into great players for Liverpool to buy. Jurgen Klopp is looking to change all that of course, but his first week in charge saw him losing key players to season ending injuries at a rate of one a day. Continue at that rate and he'll be picking himself at centre back for this one – and still almost certainly do a better job than Dejan Lovren. * - Hyped-up branding to be confirmed.
