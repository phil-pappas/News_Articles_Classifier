In his photographs, human figures are often lost in the vastness of icy mountain ranges or thunderous waterfalls . A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he said it's his faith that helps him connect with the places he visits. \n\"Every time I go somewhere, my soul is stirred and I feel drawn closer to my creator,\" Burkard told The Huffington Post. \nBukard said some of his favorite moments are when he's able to connect with people and cultures on a spiritual level. During his travels, he said, he makes it a point to go to a church and pray with the people -- an experience that he said adds to his own spirituality. \n\"I want people to see the beauty in creation in some way, whatever their own way is, and glorify God in that,\" he said. \"You can find spiritual experiences in a lot of different places, not just at church on a Sunday.\" \nBurkard agreed to take over HuffPost Religion's Instagram account on Friday, and he shared six reflections about his faith journey.
