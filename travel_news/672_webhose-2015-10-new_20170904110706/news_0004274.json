Global installation rate of TPMS reached 36% in 2014, up 6 percentage points from 2013, and is expected to exceed 45% in 2015, creating a demand of more than 40 million sets.\nEU now is the focus of global TPMS. On the one hand, its OEM demand for TPMS is expected to hit 16.65 million sets, surpassing the United States as the world's largest market, and on the other hand, considerable AM demand for TPMS is brought about. Harsh winter in many EU countries makes snow tire an additional necessity for new vehicles. Hence, the introduction of mandatory regulations on TPMS in Nov first created demand for TPMS from snow tire. EU will become the world's largest TPMS market, either OEM or AM.\nThe mainland China compiled its first technical standard for passenger vehicle TPMS in Mar 2015 , and carried out a month-long opinion soliciting. The standard will replace original GB/T 26149-2010 with some changes made in the aspects of product scope, product roadmap, and technical standard. The standard is a technically mandatory one but not a requirement on mandatory installation. As of early Sept 2015 , the official document has not yet been released.\nThe mainland China's demand for TPMS comes primarily from OEM market and has grown rapidly during 2014-2015.The demand surged by 78.9% from a year ago to 4.42 million sets in 2014 and is expected to reach 6.67 million sets in 2015, a year-on-year jump of 50.9%. Relying on huge automobile market, China has become the TPMS market with the greatest potential, attracting a large number of companies.\nTop four foreign players- Schrader, Continental, Pacific Industrial, and ZF TRW all have set up factories in mainland China ; Taiwanese peers- Orange Electronic, CUB Elecparts, and Mobiletron Electronics all have entered the mainland Chinese market via establishment of factories or offices; Chinese companies- State Auto Electronics, Shanghai Baolong Automotive, Nanjing Top Sun Technology, Kysonix, Hamaton Automotive Technology, Steelmate, and Shanghai HangSheng Industry are stepping up their layout in OEM and AM markets.
