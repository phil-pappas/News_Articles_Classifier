The new route will be the first nonstop service between the two cities.\nHainan Airlines held a press conference at Manchester Airport on the afternoon of October 23 rd , with Chinese President Xi Jinping, British Prime Minister David Cameron , HNA Group chairman Chen Feng , Manchester Airports Group chief executive Charlie Cornish , Hainan Airlines president Xie Haoming as well as representatives from government agencies and media organizations in China and the UK in attendance. Hainan Airlines' upcoming Beijing - Manchester route is one of the important achievements during President Xi's visit to the UK. The press conference was the last event attended by President Xi before leaving the country.\nHNA Group chairman Chen Feng said at the event, \"As a company born in China and now actively expanding into international markets, Hainan Airlines is doing its bit to assure the success of the 'One Belt, One Road' initiative and has progressively been adding nonstop flights connecting China with Europe over the last few years. I believe that the Beijing - Manchester route that will be launched will serve to create a new air bridge.\"\nCongratulating Hainan Airlines on the launch of the new route, Manchester Airports Group CEO Charlie Cornish said, \"I am honored to witness the launch of Hainan Airlines' Beijing - Manchester route. The new route is expected to inject over 250 million pounds into the UK economy. Manchester Airport is the international gateway to the North of English and an important factor in the country's effort to revitalize the region. Launching of the new route will help the North of England attract more investment from China and make the region significantly more accessible to Chinese businessmen and executives.\"\nThe Beijing - Manchester route will be Hainan Airlines' sixth international route following the launch of the Chongqing - Rome , Beijing -San Jose, Shanghai - Boston , Shanghai - Seattle and Beijing - Prague routes earlier this year. The launch of the Beijing - Manchester route will further improve Hainan Airlines' global network. With more international routes on tap to be launched by the airline, travelers from China will find it much easier to visit major cities around the world through Hainan Airlines' network as well as those of its global partners, as well as to be serviced by any of the airports under Manchester Airports Group.\nHainan Airlines' Beijing-Manchester Route Flight Schedule (Note: All departure and arrival times are listed in local time):\nFlight Number\nPoint of Departure\nDeparture Time\nDestination\nArrival Time\nFlights\nHU7903\nBeijing\n1:45 am\nManchester\n6:05 am\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday\nHU7904\nManchester\n12:00 noon\nBeijing\n5:25 am next day\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday\nAbout Hainan Airlines:\nHainan Airlines Co., Ltd., founded in January 1993 , is committed to providing passengers with comprehensive and seamless air travel services as one of the world's seven SKYTRAX five-star airlines and one of the world's top 10 safest airlines.\nHainan Airlines has a young luxury fleet mainly composed of Boeing 737s, 787s and Airbus 330s configured for both passenger and cargo flights, providing passengers with premium first class in which each seat is surrounded by dividers assuring the passenger full privacy as well as a newly upgraded spacious and comfortable business class.
