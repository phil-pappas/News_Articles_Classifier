Well, Porter Yates , 35, from Brooklyn, New York , did just that five years ago and he hasn't looked back.\nIn 2010, Yates was at a crossroads in his engineering job and wanted a new direction in life, so he decided to go travelling and document what he saw.\nHe returned to engineering, arranging a job in China in 2012, but discovered that he was more passionate about photographing the country than his job.\nSince then, he has focused on photography and has made a career out of his hobby, travelling to places like Ecuador, Indonesia, India, Tibet and Mexico, and selling the images he captures in order to make a living.\nHe told MailOnline: When I first started traveling I knew little about the places I had never been, my ignorance of a place walled it off and made it feel inaccessible.\n'The unknown can be very intimidating. The more I travelled the more I was surprised about how accommodating the world is. It still confounds me.'\nRead on to see some of Porter's photos from his travels around the world.\nA boy stands with an elephant at an elephant village in Jaipur, India.
