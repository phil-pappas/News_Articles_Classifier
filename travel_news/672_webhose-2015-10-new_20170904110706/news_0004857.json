The full extent of the damage is yet to be fully understood, but reports suggest that heavy damage appears to have been avoided. However, heavy rains continue and there are reports of flash flooding. There is also a high threat of subsequent landslides across the mountainous region. Roads and infrastructure have been damaged and the impact on rural communities in the hard to reach areas of the regions, particular the mountains, is not yet known. Save the Children is also monitoring the situation in already flooded Texas as the storm moves toward the border. Anthony Caswell, Director of International Affairs at Save the Children Mexico, and Jorge Vidal, Director of Programmes at Save the Children Mexico, are now travelling to Puerto Vallarta on the west Mexican coast, one of the worst affected areas hit by Hurricane Patricia. Anthony is available for English language interviews, and Jorge is available for Spanish language interviews. ***Please note that Anthony and Jorge will be available for interview from Saturday at 9am (CDT) *** To arrange media interviews please contact Francine Uenuma, who will be with Anthony and Jorge on the coast, at the number below: Francine Uenuma", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:35:12.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
