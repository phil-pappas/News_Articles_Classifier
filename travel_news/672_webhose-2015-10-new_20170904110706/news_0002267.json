The boys played bloody well. I thought they were going to win the Rugby World Cup 2015 quarter-final against Australia at one stage but the decisions went against us. If we'd won one of the two line-outs it could have been totally different. That's just the way it goes sometimes. Scotland played well, though. I don't think there's any question that they will grow from this. They're achieving their goals. Greig Laidlaw is a good leader of men and this is a young squad of players. As always, time will tell. You've got to seize the day as a team and we did that. We can all be really proud of the boys I think they'll target the Six Nations and see how far they can get in that. That will be a good measuring stick for them and show us how far they've come. A lot of the other nations are losing players, but Scotland are going to be pretty settled for the foreseeable future. Everybody's raving about the game. They've all got something to say about it. Scotland may have gone out but they're being seen as heroes for the way they played in the tournament and for the way they handled themselves. I just hope expectations don't go too high now and people do a U-turn and start expecting us to win everything after this. This is just the way forward for us. Rotten luck: Scotland players applaud their fans Photo: Getty If the referee Craig Joubert had just called for a scrum... there was only a minute or so to go. We'd have been through to a semi-final and it's been a long time since we've been there. I thought we scored some good tries, kept the ball well, moved it well and were ambitious. Greig had another outstanding game . During the match, the streets in the Borders were empty. I was with some of my mates. There were about a dozen of us altogether and we were in a small pub. All the pubs were pretty busy. I was with some of the kids at the schools on Monday morning and they were all talking about it. That's great for us. You just hope the World Cup leaves a legacy and that it continues and rugby starts to evolve again. I always thought it was a bit in the doldrums, but this has picked us up again. Everything's about execution and taking your opportunities, no matter how you get them. If it's an interception, you've got to pounce on it and take the opportunity. You've got to seize the day as a team and I thought we did that. We can all be really proud of the boys. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:31:03.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
