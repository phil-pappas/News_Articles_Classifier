It's another move that signals the way the big airlines want to remake the industry -- a remaking that does not bode well for consumers.\nWhat Delta did, specifically, was end a longstanding agreement with American that allowed reciprocity in two key situations:\n-- Delta will no longer ticket connecting itineraries with American. If your trip requires a connection from Delta to American, or if you fly Delta one way and American on your round-trip return, you will no longer be allowed to do so on a single ticket. At best, it's a minor inconvenience; at worst, a major hassle. On a connecting flight, you might have to exit security at your connecting airport, claim your checked baggage, re-check your bag and repeat security screening before you could catch your connecting flight.\n-- If your American flight suffers a serious delay, American can no longer \"sign over\" your ticket to Delta and put you on a Delta flight.\nAlthough Delta initiated the move, obviously it works both ways.\nDuring the huge growth of air travel following World War II, no one airline went everywhere, even within the United States. If you wanted to fly from Denver to Dayton, for example, you had to take two different airlines. To make worldwide air travel feasible, airlines, their governmental regulators and international aviation bodies structured a system that allowed relatively seamless travel on multiple airlines. You could fly from Denver to Dayton or from Denver to Darwin, Australia, on a single ticket, at a through fare, with baggage checked just once.\nYou could enjoy the round-trip fare even if you started on one line and returned on another. United could issue your ticket, even if your itinerary involved flights on United, Pan American and Ansett Airlines. Airline \"clearinghouses\" sorted out the distribution of the fare receipts. And if your United flight was delayed, United could sign your ticket over to American so you could complete your trip as quickly as possible. Although nominally competitive, the world's big airlines cooperated to benefit consumers.\nIn the U.S., this all started to come unraveled in 1978 with deregulation. New low-fare airlines and former charter airlines never got into interlining and the clearinghouse systems. The old Rule 240 \"we will transfer you\" morphed into \"we may transfer you\" on some lines and \"no transfer\" on others.\nMy take is that the big three legacy lines, with Delta out in front, want to take the \"cooperate\" out of the old \"compete but cooperate\" regime entirely. \"Other businesses don't have to cooperate with competitors as we do,\" they say, and when they refuse to remedy obvious consumer abuses and the government enacts some protections, they complain about \"excessive regulation.\"\nThe demise of the old system will be a gradual process. Delta's separation from American isn't the first, and it won't be the last. And so few consumers get hurt each time an agreement ends that nobody raises an alarm. But the endpoint of the process could create lots of consumer pain: three giant monolithic airlines, each with its alliances and a few other partners, all of which want nothing to do with each other and with no consumer protections.\nInitially the main pain point for consumers will be loss of transfer to other airlines in delays and cancellations. But lack of through fares and single tickets on connecting itineraries will also create some problems. Maybe, in the U.S., a single airline can get you from most places to most other places, but that's certainly not the case worldwide. Loss of near-universal interlining will undoubtedly lead to lots of consumer pain.\nConsumer advocates aren't totally silent on this issue. Several have included a mandatory \"Rule 240\" provision in various \"bill of rights\" proposals. Unfortunately, I haven't seen much traction for them yet. And, to my knowledge, nobody has yet taken up the issue of interline ticketing and baggage checking. Conclusion: there's more pain coming.
