This is seen as disadvantageous for travel consultants, as products and services found directly on airline websites are often more robust. \n\n“The study bears out that the travel agent channel as currently situated is not able to efficiently meet all the needs of air travellers. NDC will address this gap by enabling efficient access to content that currently is available only on airline websites,” said Aleks Popovich, senior vice president financial and distribution services, IATA. \n\nThe study also revealed that the development of branded fares, sometimes referred to as fare families, has created some confusion in the travel agency community. Around one in four travel agencies are uncertain whether they book fare families or branded fares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:48:49.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
