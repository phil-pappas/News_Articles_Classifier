Image: Dundee Airport / Facebook \n\"We are mindful that this can cause inconvenience for the local community, especially in the early morning and at night. This system is entirely silent. \n\"Because lasers can present a risk to aircraft the process is subject to stringent risk assessments and our staff are fully trained in their use. Ad Feedback \n\"The laser we are trialling can project a beam for about 2km (1.25 miles) in distance so it has a very long range and is so far proving very effective at deterring birds in a safe and humane manner. \n\"It does have something of the look of Star Wars about it, but it obviously has a serious purpose - to keep the airfield clear of birds and thus ensure the safety of aircraft.' \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:31:10.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
