You know, the annoying one who blocks the escalator stairs while reading their text messages or swiping their latest match on Tinder.\nIf you aren’t a subway native, how do you know when you’re being a jerk?\nMillions of people flock to big cities every year for jobs or vacation with little or no train commuting experience, so veteran riders in New York, Chicago, Washington and San Francisco clued us in on the rules of the rails:\n1. Most annoying: Don't stand in place on the left side of escalators. We aren’t knocking you for not wanting to hike the stairs, but park yourself on the right side for those of us who want to walk up the moving escalator. We want to get out as fast as possible, and you are making that impossible.\n2. Wait your turn. You aren’t the only one with somewhere to be. Blocking the train doors slows everything and everyone down. And nobody has time for that.\n3. Stop eating up space with your backpack. Keep it on your lap instead, and if you are standing, take it off to make room for another passenger. All your twisting and turning causes your backpack to jab us.\n4. Those signs saying “No food or drink?” They apply to you, too. Those Doritos are probably delicious, but that lip smacking and crunching sounds disgusting.\n5. Even veteran riders don’t like doing this, but it is part of the deal. Move to the middle of the train when others board to make room for everyone waiting to get on.\n6. Shh. Some of us are just waking up or we are heading home from a long day. We can do without your blasting the latest Kanye West so loudly it leaks from your headphones. When it doubt, remember, silence is golden.\n7. Stay off the phone. We aren’t interested in the latest drama with your significant other or where you are having dinner with friends.\n8. Have common courtesy. Get up and let pregnant women and the elderly take a seat.\n109 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1RUvMbu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809537029795132-subway1.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RUvMbu&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1373753044d99933a84bbd0159c6af0f99b4b7ff/r=500x390/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809537029795132-subway1.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1RUvMbu", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7622e2e026643c74931f7b05ea65e2fcc61e57fe/c=0-45-3136-2403&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809537029795132-subway1.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RUvMbu&text=Don%27t%20be%20that%20person%20on%20the%20subway&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-21T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:40:01.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
