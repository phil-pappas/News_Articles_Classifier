(Tõnu Tunnel) \nThe megaphones are so large that they can double as a stage for musicians looking to fill the forest with their own sounds. The wooden structures can also be used as a seating area for picnicking with friends or taking a break during a nature walk. They’re the perfect place to sit and contemplate the wonders of the natural world—or duck out of the rain when a shower strikes mid-hike. \nThe megaphones are strategically placed in the woods so that when a hiker stands in the center, the sound of the forest envelops them with the type of 360-degree surround sound to which your at-home entertainment system can only aspire. The electricity-free megaphones are free for all nature lovers to enjoy and will remain in the park, theoretically, until the wood is reclaimed by nature.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:09:40.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
