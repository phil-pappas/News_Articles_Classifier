These airports and transit systems make it easy for the traveler needing to get from the airport to the city center cheap and fast. \nCourtesy of Rhys A. \nO'Hare International Airport -- Chicago, Illinois \nAlthough O'Hare is known for its delays and overcrowded terminals, getting there is one thing you won't have to worry about. The Blue Line on the Chicago Transit Authority's El train goes from O'Hare and stops all along the way, eventually ending up right downtown. The train runs every couple of minutes and it only costs $2.50 for a ride. Midway, Chicago's other airport, is also connected to downtown by the Orange Line, and just as easily accessible. \nCourtesy of SimonRahn. \nEl Prat Airport -- Barcelona, Spain \nThe RENFE train runs from the airport to downtown about every 30 minutes. It's a nearly 25-minute ride through the Catalan countryside. Get off at Sants Estacio, Passeig de Gracia or the Clot stop, and then you can take the city Metro to wherever you specifically want to go. If you are heading to the airport, you'll want to catch the train at any of those stations and get off at the Aeropuerto stop. Pretty simple. Tickets for individual journeys cost just over € 2. \nCourtesy of Ron Reiring. \nMinneapolis-St. Paul International Airport -- Minneapolis, Minnesota \nYou can take your pick how you get to this airport: bus, train or bike. In such a physically fit city, authorities felt it necessary to connect Terminal 2 to a bike path that leads to downtown Minneapolis. (There's also a 1.4-mile walking path inside Terminal 1). Light rail trains run every 10 minutes during peak hours, when fares are $2.25, and 15 minutes during off hours, when fares are $1.75. The trains connect to 17 locations, including downtown Minneapolis, downtown St. Paul and the nearby Mall of America. \nCourtesy of Thomas Depenbusch. \nCologne Bonn Airport -- Cologne, Germany \nThe train from Cologne's city center to the airport drops passengers off right in the middle of the airport at the Intercity-Express (ICE) station. When heading downtown, take the S-train right to the city center. The ride will take about 20 to 30 minutes and stop four or five times before arriving right downtown. The cost is about €2.60. \nCourtesy of Josh Hallett. \nHartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport -- Atlanta, Georgia \nIn an airport that is so big it has it's own zip code, getting to and from it without hassle is key. Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (also known affectionately as MARTA) runs trains between the airport and other stops throughout Atlanta frequently, starting at 5 a.m. on weekdays and 6 a.m. on weekends until 1 a.m. every night. If you're heading to the airport, it'll drop you right inside the domestic terminal. Rides are $2.50.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:45:26.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
