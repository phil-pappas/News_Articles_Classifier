A chartered accountant by profession, Hickey joins Staycity with a strong property background having spent 13 years with Irish developer Ballymore, most recently as Finance Director UK & Ireland. \n“Staycity is a growing brand in an expanding sector,” said Hickey. “I’m delighted to be joining the company as we embark on a strong expansion programme over the next 12 months. We are actively seeking sites both in the UK and in key cities across Europe.” Hickey brings a combination of experience to Staycity including that of strategy development, financing and property acquisition. He has also held financial director roles in several large companies over recent years. Staycity is currently in a period of rapid growth. Later this year the company will open aparthotels in Lyon and Birmingham Newhall Square with further openings in Marseille, London Covent Garden and York due for 2016 as well as a significant expansion of its Heathrow property, which first opened in 2012. Barry Hickey replaces Chief Commercial Officer Anthony Carragher who is leaving Staycity after two years to pursue his own interests. Said CEO Tom Walsh: “I would like to thank Anthony for all the superb work he has done for us. I am very much looking forward to working with Barry whose experience of project management and financial expertise will be an asset as we move forward.” By Summer 2016, Staycity will operate over 1,800 apartments in 15 properties across 10 European cities including Birmingham, Dublin, Edinburgh, Liverpool, London Covent Garden, London Heathrow, London Greenwich, Lyon, Manchester, Marseille, Paris and Amsterdam.
