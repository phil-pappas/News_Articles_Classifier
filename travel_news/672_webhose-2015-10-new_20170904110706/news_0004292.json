The 70-tonne whale, which had never before seen a human being, came straight down on top of Skerry, stopping inches from his face before turning sideways so its grapefruit-sized eye could take him in. \n\"It's one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had,\" says Skerry, phoning from coastal Massachusetts where he has been filming great white sharks. \"I could have been squashed like a bug on the bottom, but all the whales were very aware of me, very cautious and gentle and I never had a problem.\" \nUNDERWATER ADVENTURES \nA diver swims with sharks. Photo: BRIAN SKERRY \nFor nearly 40 years, Skerry has been chasing moments like these, since realising as a child that he could combine photography with underwater exploration. He is best known for the work he has done for National Geographic since 1998, photographing stories on dolphin communication, vanishing coral reefs, the importance of marine reserves, and the decimation of fish populations worldwide. \nFROM THE ARCHIVE: Ad Feedback \nHe didn't set out to chronicle environmental disaster, but he has become a staunch advocate for endangered creatures beneath the waves, both the ones we identify as cute and lovable, such as fur seals, and those that frighten or bewilder us, such as sharks. \nSpeaking to groups around the world, as he does in Auckland and Wellington this month, Skerry shares personal stories of the beauty and grandeur of the ocean, but also its vulnerability. We kill 100 million sharks each year, he points out, and species of sea turtles and sea birds are on the brink of extinction. Our intervention has been disastrous.\" \nOCEAN AT RISK \nA harp seal pup takes its first swim. Photo: BRIAN SKERRY \n\"The ocean is one of the most magnificent realms that you can visit,\" he says, still awed by what he encounters beneath the waves. \"It represents 98 percent of our biosphere, every second breath we take comes from the ocean, however it is in trouble and it's not too late. We can still do something about it. The message is really one of hope and celebration, with a sobering dose of realisation that these are issues we need to address. I do believe we are at a point in history where there is a growing awareness. I do sense that [people have] this real appetite to know what they can do to help this situation.\" \nHis images are a valuable tool in making people stop and consider the plight of special — and disappearing — creatures that few of us ever see up close. You can't help but be impressed by dolphins collaboratively herding fish to hunt them. Or be touched by the thoughtful pose of a manatee. \nAs much as he is an artist, Skerry is an adventurer too, heading to places few people see and regularly putting himself in danger for the best shot. He has dived under eight-metre thick, moving Arctic ice to photograph harp seals, including an iconic image of a white-coated pup taking its first dip. He swims amongst sharks but says perhaps the most terrifying creature he's encountered is actually the Humboldt squid, which has 24,000 teeth arrayed along its eight limbs and will eat anything that moves. \nENGIMATIC CREATURES \nA Florida manatee swimming in a fresh water spring. Photo: BRIAN SKERRY \nHe once spent seven days living underwater at Aquarius, an undersea lab off the coast of Florida. A sort of fixed submarine attached to the sea floor 19 metres below the surface, it allows researchers to spend days and weeks underwater, diving for up to nine hours at a time and returning to rest inside the habitat, which is set up with bunks and a kitchen. NASA uses it to train astronauts, as diving is the closest they can get to space conditions. There are lights outside Aquarius that flood the surrounding sea with light at night. \"You can lie in your bunk and watch sharks glide past,\" says Skerry. \"It's pretty cool.\" \nWhen it comes to choosing a favourite subject he says, \"There are things that stir my soul. I am very interested in enigmatic creatures in the ocean — billfish, swordfish or marlin, things we don't see very often. I do have to say I have frequently returned to photographing sharks. I love them as subjects. They are exquisite, they blend grace with power and it's just beautiful to watch them and I never get tired of that. But they also need help.\" \nHe is hopeful that he will continue his work for decades to come. At 53, he has time. \"I have colleagues who are in their 70s and are still diving,\" he says. Celebrated underwater filmmaker Stan Waterman retired at 90. By necessity the type of work Skerry does will change as he ages. \"When I was 25 I was deep sea shipwreck diving and I'd be lifting these 90-kilogram tanks onto my back, and I'm not doing that today.\" \nNational Geographic photographer Brian Skerry speaks at the Aotea Centre in Auckland on October 21 and at Te Papa in Wellington on October 22. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:31:44.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
