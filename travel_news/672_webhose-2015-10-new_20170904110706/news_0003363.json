Take a swatch to Garage Italia Customs , a new Milan-based design center, and they will happily emulate the shade on your new Fiat 500, Vespa, yacht, helicopter—or just about any other vehicle. “If you dream it, we can do it,” said Lapo Elkann , founder of the venture, whose new headquarters was unveiled this week.\nElkann’s Garage Italia encourages drivers to embrace one-of-a-kind vehicles, something Kylie Jenner has already done , with the matte Ferrari 458 convertible seen round the world. Who wants to get around town incognito when one can choose from wrap-painted prints, patterns, textures, colors, graphics, and seasonal revamps?\n“Special-project cars have a long history,” said the brand’s creative director, Carlo Borromeo, with Gianni Agnelli’s silver custom-made BB 512 Ferrari on display behind him. “What’s out there tends to be nostalgic and often plays on the hot rod–type era. We want to alter this. We want to bring a fashion sensibility to the category, a seasonality, and some Italian flair.”\nBorromeo said that the company aims to harken back to Italy’s boom years, when car owners would take new vehicles to a sartorial , or tailor, to be upholstered in fabrics and hides of their choice. Garage Italia’s wrap-printed graphics take about two days to complete and will cost about €1,500, or approximately $1,692.\nThe new studio in Milan is housed in a landmark ’50s-era building and former AGIP gas station. Styled in the Streamline Moderne genre of the 1930s (a short-lived offshoot of the Art Deco movement that had an infatuation with speed, cars, and the future), the building is a fitting venue for the new venture, and will soon be restored by Italian architect Michele De Lucchi. “I thought it was an embarrassment such a building had been left empty for 20 years,” Elkann explained. “We decided this had to be our home.”\nElkann, no interloper in the auto industry, said he will offer an unprecedented level of craftsmanship, achieved by a near-maniacal attention to detail. “This is the Ferrari Tailor-Made program 3.0,” he said, referring to his time spent customizing luxury supercars for Ferrari. “I want to take what I learned there and innovate further.”\nA sampling of customized vehicles was parked in the garage’s forecourt on inauguration day, many of them as distinctive and identifiable as Elkann’s taste in tailoring: a blue dégradé BMW; a Ferrari with a zingy camouflage paint job; and a natty pied-a-poule Fiat 500. The company has customized approximately 70 cars so far, as well as two sailboats, a Baglietto MV13 motorboat named LAP-1 in honor of Elkann, three planes (Hawker 4000, Learjet 45, Beechcraft King Air), and various Vespa scooters. (There is a 43-meter yacht in the works.)\nThe fully-restored Garage Italia headquarters will debut during next year’s Salone del Mobile, and he is currently eyeing additional locations in Miami and Monte Carlo. “I always wanted to return to the automotive business,” Elkann said at the Milan opening, which happened to coincide with his 38th birthday and was attended by a crowd of well-wishers, friends, and family that included Ginevra Elkann, Beatrice Borromeo, Marta Marzotto, Marta Ferri, and Coco Brandolini D’Adda. “Launching the brand today is the best present I could hope for.”", "external_links": ["http://garageitaliacustoms.it/", "http://www.people.com/article/kylie-jenner-paints-ferrari-gray-kendall-jenner-lunch-beverly-hills"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:00:51.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
