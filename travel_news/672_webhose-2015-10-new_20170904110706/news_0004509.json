EVA Airways will join the 787-10 launch customer team and will be one of the first airlines in the world to introduce the newest member of the 787 Dreamliner family.\n \nOnce the deal is finalized, it will be posted on the Boeing Orders and Deliveries website.\n \n“We look forward to welcoming EVA Airways as Boeing’s newest member of the 787-10 Dreamliner launch customer group,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “EVA Airways has been a valued Boeing customer over the past few decades and we are honored that they continue to introduce new Boeing widebody airplanes into their growing world-class fleet.”\n \nEVA Airways continues to modernize its long-haul fleet to replace aging aircraft and these new airplanes will allow the airline to expand into new markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, Oceania and North America.\n \nThe airline currently operates more than 37 Boeing airplanes in its fleet, including 21 777-300ERs. The 777-300ER is the backbone of EVA Airways’ growing fleet and the carrier is the world’s 8th largest 777-300ER operator and 4th largest in Asia.\n \nWith its intent to purchase two additional 777-300ERs as part of this deal, EVA Airways will have unfilled orders for 15 777-300ERs and five 777 Freighters, as well as 24 787-10s – both direct purchased and leased.\n \nThe 787-10 will be the third and longest member of the super-efficient 787 family. With its greater passenger and cargo capacity, robust range and passenger-pleasing features, the 787-10 will complement EVA’s Boeing widebody fleet while setting a new benchmark for fuel efficiency and operating economics. The 787-10 will be 25 percent better in fuel and emissions than the airplanes it replaces and more than 10 percent better than anything offered by the competition for the future.\n \nSource:- Boeing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:37:10.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
