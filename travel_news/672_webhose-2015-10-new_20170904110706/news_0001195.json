The service provides e-commerce shoppers the option to ship online purchases directly to one of 60 convenient InPost pick-up locations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The InPost network ( www.inpost24.ca ) will be expanding to 200 GTA locations by year end and 1,000 locations across Canada in 2016.\nNewegg customers can now enjoy the ultimate flexibility to pick up their items when and where they want – InPost lockers are accessible 24/7 and the self-serve pick-up process takes under 10 seconds to complete. In addition, shipping directly to an InPost locker is a more efficient delivery method for Newegg, offering significant savings over home delivery.\nKunal Thakkar , Senior Vice President of Operations at Newegg says, \"Newegg is constantly innovating to improve our customer experience while continuing to offer market-leading value, selection and service. Giving Newegg customers the option to pick up at an InPost locker aligns with our vision and will continue to differentiate our service from other e-retailers.\"\nConvenient delivery options are key to accelerating e-commerce sales in Canada . Studies show half of households are unattended during working hours and over 40% of consumers are more likely to shop online when locker delivery is available.* To address this demand, Newegg now makes a subset of its products available for pick-up at InPost Lockers, with much broader product availability expected in 2016.\n\"Our automated parcel machines are becoming an irreplaceable form of easy and quick delivery of items for all Canadian e-shoppers,'' says InPost Canada CEO Tony Jasinski . \"We are delighted to be partnering with Newegg, an e-commerce leader dedicated to ensuring everyone's shopping and customer-service expectations are surpassed.\"\nInPost plans to roll out 1,000 locations nationally in 2016 under site agreements with major retailers, grocery outlets and gas stations.\nAbout InPost Worldwide\nThe InPost parcel-locker network is the largest international network of automatic machines making it easy to send and receive parcels 24/7.
