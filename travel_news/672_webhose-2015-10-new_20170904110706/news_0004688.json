This year, the harvest is expected to come by early November. - + When the winter breeze is about to blow in late October, the terraced rice paddies around Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest peak in Chiang Mai, gradually turn gold and become even more vibrant, offering a picturesque view for those in search of a great landscape. \nOn a shady cliff-sided mountain road, I make my way carefully through a peaceful narrow lane which snakes around Doi Inthanon. To the side of me are terraced rice paddies which fill up the whole valley of Ban Pha Mon, where tourists flock to witness the stunning view. \n\"Rice farming is part of the Karen people's life,\" explains Surasit Donjaipraiwon, the public relations officer and co-ordinator of the Ban Pha Mon-Nong Lom Homestay Project. \n\"Thai tourists come here for the impressive scenery of the terraced rice fields when they are at their most lush, just when they are on the verge of ripening and turning golden yellow. They just relax and take selfies while foreigners come for the unique experiences they'll discover in the midst of the Karen people's community.\" \nBan Pha Mon and Nong Lom are peaceful Karen villages. Local guides welcome tourists to explore their villages on bikes and to learn about the Karen people's simple lifestyle, which is comprised of weaving, farming, trekking and cooking. Revenue from the tourism business contributes to the improvement of the Karen people's welfare, forest protection and their education. \n\"Though not many Thai people want to know, we try to communicate to all visitors how important the forest and water are for life here,\" says Surasit. If you find Ban Pha Mon too quiet, some more popular terraced rice paddies can be found a few kilometres away, on Highway 1009, at Ban Mae Klang Luang. \nBan Mae Klang Luang is another Karen community. It became a popular destination recently after its beautiful scenery was featured in the Thai film Neung Jai Diaokan, or Where The Miracles Happen (2008). \nToday, there are a number of bungalows popping up that draw in tourists and photographers who hunt for stunning landscapes to view and capture. Visitors can also explore the village and try its home-grown Arabica coffee. \nThose who are on a serious hunt for that picture perfect view of rice paddies should try to climb all the way to the far side of the mountain to Pa Pong Piang. Once a very remote place, this Christian Karen village today has become a very famous site highly sought after by photographers and visitors. \nSituated on Doi Inthanon's shoulder, its rice paddies snake in contoured patterns on one side against a stunning backdrop of colourful fields and mountain ranges that stretch across the horizon. \nFrom Pa Pong Piang and in the valley ahead is Mae Chaem, a sleepy town where even more terraced rice paddies can be found in the midst of its vast valley. \nRice farming has long been part of the life here. Mae Chaem people grow sticky rice for home consumption and will sell the rice if there is an oversupply in stocks. Rice plays a significant role in local traditions. After the harvest, the grains are kept dry in teak barns. Before cooking the rice of the new harvest, the Mae Chaem people organise a merit-making ceremony called Tan Khao Mai , which when translated means \"new rice merit\". Part of their rice stock as well as some rice-based sweets are donated to monks. \nThe Sun lingers over the mountains while tourists scoot along to catch their best shot of the last rays of sunlight as they hit the rice fields with a golden colour. If you are in search of some dreamy shots of terraced rice paddies, look no further; in the beginning of the cold season, Doi Inthanon will offer you such a photo opportunity. \nTerraced rice paddies at Ban Mae Klang Luang are situated right on the road towards Doi Inthanonâ€™s peak. \nPha Dok Siew Waterfall is a few kilometres from Ban Mae Klang Luang. It was a famous scene in the Thai film The Memory (2006). \nAfter harvest, Karen farmers remove dust and straw from the rice grains by throwing them into the air and letting the breeze separate the rice. \nThe Pink Bamboo House is a comfortable place to stay in Ban Pha Mon, situated just over a valley. The house is mostly made of bamboo and offers a great view of all the terraced rice fields. There is a kitchen where guests can cook by themselves or enjoy learning how to cook the authentic cuisine of Karen people. \nBan Kong Kan, around 5km from Mae Chaem, offers a panoramic view of terraced rice fields. Wat Kong Kan, the designated temple of the village, houses a gigantic Buddha statue, the biggest one in town. \nSurasit Donjaipraiwon, from Ban Pha Mon, says Karen villagers have now learned that tourism can improve their standard of living after the revenues from tourism have started being used to contribute towards better welfare for them.
