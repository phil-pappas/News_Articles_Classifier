(Sanborn) offers a complete solution for government appraisers to decidedly streamline the process of property valuation. Using this process, some counties have reported adjusting the values of thousands of properties upward by millions of dollars, adding several hundred thousand dollars to annual tax rolls.\nSanborn provides the nation's most accurate oblique aerial imagery, available in 2.5-inch, 3-inch, 4-inch and 6-inch resolutions, which enable extremely precise property measurement and assessment. Because the imagery is collected using multiple camera angles during the same flight, not only are the tops of buildings visible, but also the sides, allowing appraisers to discover features that may not be visible in traditional aerial imagery, or even by walking past the property.\nAdditionally, Sanborn provides automated change-detection tools that eliminate the time and expense of visually searching the data for new or altered features. The tools help speed up the appraisal process by highlighting areas where change has occurred.\n\"Most appraisers will realize a substantial return on investment with this technology because it significantly reduces the time and effort compared with traditional assessment approaches,\" says Jason Caldwell , vice president of marketing and sales. \"Sanborn's solution allows government appraisers to efficiently analyze thousands of properties and assign the appropriate property values.\"\nSanborn Data Licensing a Boon to Local Government\nAdditionally, because Sanborn offers the industry's most liberal data licensing policies, appraisers can form partnerships to help share the cost of the imagery with other entities. Similar to the appraisal process, county planners can use the data to detect new zoning violations and monitor properties granted special-use status or some other variance from zoning code. Data sharing can include departments within the appraisers' governments, such as public works, or separate entities within their jurisdictions, such as water or fire districts.\nAbout The Sanborn Map Company, Inc.\nSanborn ( www.sanborn.com ) is a preeminent leader in the exploding geospatial industry, delivering state-of-the-art mapping solutions to customers worldwide.
