The close proximity, well-developed tourism services, weaker Japanese yen and Tokyo's exemption of the consumption tax for foreign visitors also help the country attract tourists from China. \nOn the other hand, Hong Kong, which has seen growing anti-mainlander sentiment, saw a 20% year-on-year drop of business during the week from a year earlier, as well as a 20%-30% decline in the number of tourists from across the border. \nHong Kong lost sales of consumer goods and foodstuffs to Japan and sales of luxury goods to North America and Europe. \nChina itself also posted slower growth in retail sales during the weeklong holiday, gaining only 11% from a year earlier. \nAs the country tries to transform into a consumption-driven economy, a key issue that needs to be addressed is quality, as demonstrated by domestic consumers' preference for Japanese goods. \nTaiwan's manufacturing sector underwent a similar transformation to improve product quality in the 1980s and may share its experience with its counterparts in China. \nAuthorities in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan still need to look deeper to tap into the potential buying power of Chinese consumers indicated by the recent statistics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:58:34.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
