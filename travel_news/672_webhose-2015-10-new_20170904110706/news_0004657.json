Photographer's Note \nA view of the northeastern ramparts of Wilpena Pound, with the highest peak in the Flinders Ranges, St Mary Peak (1171 m)seen here just left of centre. The photo was taken from a ridge that has easy access from the nearby road. It turned out to be a great place to view Wilpena Pound. The trees on the right are native pines of the Callitris genus. They are a distinctive feature of the Flinders Ranges.
