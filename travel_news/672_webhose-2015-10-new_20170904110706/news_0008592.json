The study was commissioned by Expedia and conducted by GfK, an independent global market research company.\nBy a slight margin, “Inattentive Parents” – parents who let their kids run wild – are the most aggravating hotel guests, having been called out by 67% of Americans. 64% of Americans are frustrated by “Hallway Hellraisers,” while 54% of Americans complained about “The Complainers,” or guests who berate hotel staff over minor inconveniences.\nThe full list of hotel etiquette violations, from most to least annoying, follows:\nInattentive Parents – 67% The Hallway Hellraisers – 64% The Complainers – 54% The In-Room Revelers (noisemakers nearby) – 52% The Bickerers – 26% The Poolside Partiers – 22% The Loudly Amorous (indiscreet lovemakers) – 21% The Hot Tub Canoodlers (amorous couples in a public hot tub) – 20% The Business Bar Boozer (sloshed business travelers) – 12% The Elevator Chatterbox – 6%\nA full analysis of the 2015 Hotel Etiquette Study can be found at Expedia’s Viewfinder blog.\n“While etiquette violations differ, they tend to come down to the same behavior: whether or not guests respect the strangers in close proximity to them,” said John Morrey , vice president and general manager, Expedia.com. “The same is true for flying, or for driving. A modicum of consideration for your fellow travelers can go a very long way and may ultimately enhance your overall travel experience.”\nTo Tip or Not to Tip\nAmericans are divided on hotel tipping habits. A full 27% report that they “do not tip” hotel employees at all. 3% have attempted to tip a hotel employee to secure a room upgrade. 51% of Americans tip their housekeepers (who are tipped more than any other employee). 40% tip for room service deliveries. 31% tip the valet. 21% tip the porter, just 10% tip the concierge and 7% tip cabana attendants.\nAmericans may be split on whether to tip the housekeeper in part because of personal organizational habits. 80% of Americans profess that they keep their hotel room “tidy,” versus 20% of guests who rely entirely on housekeeping.\nHidden Hotel Habits\nAmericans do take discreet – and sometimes indiscreet – liberties when they stay at hotels. Among them:\n26% of Americans have hoarded toiletries to take home with them; 9% have shoehorned multiple people into their room overnight without telling the hotel; 8% have secretly taken items from their hotel room; 6% sneak down to the pool first thing in the morning to “reserve” a spot by placing towels on chairs; 5% have smoked in a non-smoking room; and 2% have deliberately eavesdropped on guests in a neighboring room.\nIn addition:\n74% of Americans consider room service to be “a luxury,” versus 26% who consider it “a necessity”; 54% of Americans do use their towels multiple times for environmental reasons, at the hotel’s prompting; and 6% haggle with the hotel over their room rate at check-in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:41:34.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
