I have been told nothing can be done except to apply pre-emergent in spring. Surely something will help with my problem.\nK.W., Hillsboro\nAnswer: Building the carbon in the soil is the key to the overall control of noxious weeds. Applying any kind of organic material now will start the process. You can use humates, humic acid products, organic fertilizers, natural meals and even coffee grounds. The best choice, however, you can usually get for free by contacting tree care companies in the area. Shredded tree trimmings that might go to the landfill otherwise can be distributed on the land and do an enormous amount of good.\nTree trimmings contain carbon and cellulose but also protein from the buds, cambium, stem and leaf tissue. This balance of nitrogen and carbon feeds the soil microbes, helps hold moisture, stimulates other species of grasses and forbs, and reduces the need for the weeds to exist.\nQuestion: I need testing for dog DNA. I’ve heard you speak on the radio about testing your dog’s DNA. What did you think of it? Was it done through your vet or is this something you can send to the lab yourself? I have two new-to-me dogs from the shelter.\nR.T., San Antonio\nAnswer: We no longer have a contact or a recommendation for these tests. You might do a web search for dog DNA testing. If you find someone, let us know.\nQuestion: I know you aren’t fond of Leyland cypress because of the problems. If we had known of the problems, we wouldn’t have put one in. Ours now has several spots of dead greenery.\nWe live close to the Gaylord Texan and all of their Leylands are doing the same, as well as others nearby at a winery. Is this another result from the extremes in weather with the floods and then drought? Any advice?\nA.M., Grapevine\nAnswer: The weather could have had some influence, but there are several diseases that regularly hit Leyland cypress because it is not very well adapted here. The most common is a fungus called bot canker. The solution is the Sick Tree Treatment and adding hydrogen peroxide to the Garrett Juice spray-and-drench part of the procedure.\nResources\nOnline: Find more information about organics by using the search function on dirtdoctor.com. facebook.com/thedirtdoctor\nRadio: “The Answer” KSKY-AM (660), 8-11 a.m. Sunday. ksky.com.
