Reports Combined September 2015 Traffic for SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet Airlines\nSkyWest, Inc., today reported 162,742 block hours in September 2015, compared to 183,852 block hours in September 2014, a decrease of 21,110, or 11.5%. The net decrease was consistent with SkyWest’s fleet transition plan to improve the mix of aircraft in its fleet by adding new dual class aircraft to its fleet, while reducing its 50-seat and 30-seat aircraft.\nThe year-over-year net change was primarily driven by approximately 9,500 additional block hours from its additional 76-seat E175 aircraft and a decrease of approximately 28,000 block hours from fewer 50-seat jet and 30-seat turboprop aircraft.\nIn September 2015, SkyWest’s dual class aircraft represented approximately 39% of SkyWest’s total block hour production for the month compared to approximately 31% for the month of September 2014.\nSkyWest reported 1,574,364 block hours for year-to-date September 2015, compared to 1,716,417 block hours through September 2014, a decrease of 142,053, or 8.3%. This net change was primarily driven by approximately 76,500 additional block hours from SkyWest’s 76-seat E175 aircraft and a decrease of approximately 209,000 block hours from fewer 50-seat jet and 30-seat turboprop aircraft.\nSkyWest had 98,005 departures in September 2015 compared to 110,142 in September 2014, a decrease of 12,137, or 11.0%.
