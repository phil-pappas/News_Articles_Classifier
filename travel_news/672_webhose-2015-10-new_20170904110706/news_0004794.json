The weather is perfect for sightseeing, the prices are lower and the crowds are smaller. We booked our seven-day cruise for the last four days of September and the first three of October, with an itinerary that would take in three of the more interesting rivers in Germany.\nThe rivers of most countries flow with stories of its history, culture, and way of life. And so it was with the Mosel, Rhine and Main. Cities and towns along these rivers form much of the foundation of Germany.\n\nRon Pradinuk / Winnipeg Free Press Historic castles along the rivers dot the German landscape. \nOur itinerary would take us from Trier to Bamberg, offering some of the best sites and experiences the country has to offer. Taken together they present a cohesive collage of what Germany is today, and why it has such meaning to Europe and the rest of the world.\nStarting our journey in Trier, Germany's oldest city, proved to be the perfect launching point. During the Roman Empire, it became a power centre of its own as the capital prefecture of the Gauls, with responsibility for governing over much of the western Roman Empire.\nToday there are vestiges of Roman baths and a Roman amphitheatre which still look much like they might have centuries ago. As Christianity took hold, massive cathedrals were built, which to this day form an important part of the fabric that is the daily life of the Germans living there.\nThe Trier Cathedral is where the Holy Tunic is kept. This is purportedly the garment worn by Jesus when he died, and exhibited now only every few decades. Trier today is predominantly Catholic, as are many of the cities along these rivers until you get to the region around Heidelberg. The region going north of it, for the most part, was influenced more by Martin Luther's leadership, when he and the Catholic Church parted company after his 1517 Ninety Five Theses, which lead to the Reformation Period.\nTrier itself gave the world its own revolutionary of sorts, as the birthplace of Karl Marx. Castles and vineyards dominate much of the landscape as the ship moves past the quaint traditional towns and villages that punctuate the shorelines, creating exceptional photographic opportunities seemingly around every bend of the rivers.\nWine exports are an important contributor to the economic base of many of the cities we would visit along all three rivers, and we would sample the different ones that helped make their regions known throughout the world.\nDay trips into some of the more prominent communities like Cochem lead to explorations of places like the 1,000 year-old Reichsburg Castle, which still appears like an imposing fortress dominating the region from its steep hilltop location.\nAt the end of each day, a fine dinner, taken with some of the fine wines of the region, lead to enjoyable conversations with newfound friends in the ship's only bar. Experienced ocean cruise passengers find the single bar and structured dining seating of river voyages a hard reality to get used to at first. But with fewer than 200 passengers, friends are made quickly, and it becomes evident this is the only way small ship meals can be served.\nAs we enter the Middle Rhine, it is the preponderance of castles that capture our attention, as the ship's program director explains the background of those that have greater historical significance.\nWhile all of these castles give us a glimpse of the past, perhaps the must-see of the trip is the Marksburg Castle near Rudesheim. It is a most physically demanding tour to take because of the uneven terrain, narrow passages and significant climbing, but it is one of the few castles that has remained virtually intact since the Middle Ages.\nWhile the communities near the rivers we sail are interesting and most accessible, a side trip through the countryside affords an entirely different view of the German farm economy and lifestyle.\nVineyard tours and wine tastings are extremely popular, as are excursions that take us to cities like Heidelberg, a river city not on the three rivers we sail upon, but rather on one of its tributaries. It is the home of Germany's oldest university, evident from the age of the majority of young people we pass on the streets.\nWhile its castle is one of the prime tourist draws in the region, Heidelberg offered some of the best shopping opportunities on our trip. A number of streets have been closed off to vehicular traffic. The shops along them range from international brands, to unique local and regional outlets selling products and especially women's and men's clothing that also make the area a fashion leader.\nSailing along the Main River, our last stop will be near the city of Bamberg. While my wife shopped, myself and a number of fellow travellers from the ship chose to go on the optional beer tasting tour. Our timing coincided close to the major Oktoberfest that takes place annually in Munich, so celebrating vicariously in this way seemed somehow just. One of the samplings, a speciality of the region handed down over centuries, is a smoked beer with a hint of bacon taste. While it may be a recipe that comes down from the Middle Ages, it is also one that takes North American palates some time to get used to, but it is to this day a favourite of the locals.\nIt is always sad to leave newfound friends behind, but with the end of our cruise we know we will keep in touch with some. Others will become memories that will keep with us forever. We will treasure the sights we have seen, the places we have visited and the experiences gained sailing on a river cruise.\nOur ship was the Viking Idun. It is one of the newer ships in the Viking's extensive offerings of cruise ships around the world.\nRiver cruising is a unique experience. I am often asked to compare it to ocean cruising. My answer is always the same. It is like comparing Toronto to Tokyo, downhill skiing to bicycling, or NASCAR to the 100 yard dash. Each must be judged on its own merits.\nThere are no opulent halls or multiple entertainment options on river cruises, but the service on a river cruise is every bit as good as on an ocean voyage.\nOn a river cruise you are often steps away from the destination city you wish to visit. On an ocean cruise it can be up to a couple of hours away.\nThere is something to do every hour of the day on a cruise ship during those long and often continuous sea days when the ship doesn't touch land. People keep busy in spas, casinos or fitness rooms. On a river cruise there are no sea days. You are able to go ashore every day and experience the places that motivated you to choose your itinerary in the first place.\nAnd while most excursions are add-on charges on ocean cruises, they are included on river cruises. While they tend to be short half day motor coach or city walking tours, the guides are excellent and give you a full perspective of the places you have seen.\nFor the similarities, or the differences, for people who have yet to try river cruising, I heartily recommend it; and the three rivers of Germany may be a perfect start for you.\n\npradinukr@shaw.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:10:06.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
