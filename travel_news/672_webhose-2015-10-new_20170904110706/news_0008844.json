Save 43 percent.\" That's the header on a recent email promotion from a big online hotel booking agency. But when you look into the deal in detail, you learn that the hotel will add a mandatory $28 a day \"resort\" fee, purportedly covering a laundry list of services and amenities. Obviously that promotional notice is, to put it kindly, \"inaccurate,\" though \"deceptive\" would be a lot closer. Because the truth is that if you want that room in Vegas, you won't get it for $20, you'll pay $48. That's a big difference. And this case illustrates exactly how deceptive the practice of adding mandatory fees really is.\nOther consumer advocates and I have been pushing on this issue for several years, so far with negligible results. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission is responsible for policing deceptive advertising in industries other than airlines, including hotels, and it has had much less success than DOT has had with airfares. Last year, it sent a letter to about two dozen hotel chains warning them about the problem, but the hotels' response, at best, has been for slightly more disclosure. And FTC has not followed up on its letter or taken any enforcement action.\nIn a recent public meeting, FTC representatives stated that agency policy was to take action only against advertising that is \"per se\" deceptive, and that the mandatory fee practice is not per se deceptive. Instead, it has taken the attitude that disclosure, no matter how far into the buying process, is a sufficient remedy.\nBut guess what, FTC; disclosure is not always an adequate remedy against deception. Saying to a consumer, in effect, \"Yes, we lied about the price in our headline and in the listing we supplied to the online travel agencies; the real price is a lot higher\" is not a sufficient remedy. A decade ago the Florida attorney general, in taking action against a similar scam perpetrated by cruise lines, declared that the practice was \"inherently deceptive.\" I agree. And I honestly can't fathom how the FTC now can possibly consider the hotel mandatory fee practice as anything but \"per se deceptive.\"\nThe principles here aren't rocket science or brain surgery:\n-- If a fee is mandatory, it's part of the price. Period.\n-- The laundry list of features the fee is supposed to cover is a smoke screen. If the fee is mandatory, what a hotel says it covers is a meaningless excuse to make it sound plausible.\n-- Featuring a $48 room as a $20 room is about as \"per se\" deceptive as you can get.\nFortunately, a group of consumer advocates is opening a new front in this war against deception. Organized by Travelers United's Charlie Leocha, the group sent a letter to the current leadership of the National Association of Attorneys General urging action at the state level. Certainly, there is precedent, in the Florida case if no other. The practice of adding mandatory fees clearly violates many if not most state \"truth in advertising\" regulations. And residents of populous states who visit areas where fees are prevalent -- most notably Hawaii and Las Vegas -- are surely being scammed. Leocha has discussed this problem in enough states to conclude the state-level action has a fighting chance to succeed.\nOn still another front, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) has taken up the fight. She has written a letter urging the FTC to re-examine its position on the issue and do what it should have been doing all along. So, for now, the outlook for additional consumer protection is a bit brighter than it was at the beginning of the year:\n-- Actions by even a few big states could probably kill the practice nationally.\n-- The NAAG petition and Sen. McCaskill's letter may finally nudge the FTC off its untenable position that the practice is not per se deceptive.\nDeceptive mandatory hotel fees are spreading. Let's hope something works before it catches on anymore.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins@mind.net .
