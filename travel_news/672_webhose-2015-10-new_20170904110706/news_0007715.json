Yet the term “the City” applies to more than just the geographical square mile; it actually represents the entire cluster of British-based financial and professional services. For international finance and business, London is the gateway to Europe and also the wider world, with numerous firms managing global assets from London. Nevertheless, the continent and Britain remain key trade and investment partners. It is a place that has the infrastructure, skills and demand to use yuan-denominated products Official statistics show that more than 40 per cent of British exports of goods and services were destined for the European Union last year, while the City has more headquarters of international financial services companies than any other European city. This goes to show how the City plays a key role in shaping and driving the European economy. In recent years, London has won itself a new title as a leading offshore RMB business centre. There are several definitions as to what an RMB centre is. My view is that it is a place that has the infrastructure, skills and demand to use yuan-denominated products and services effectively. Moreover, it must have comprehensive financial relations with China and other key markets, along with a proven track record of substantial transactions in RMB. London ticks all the boxes. The City of London initiative to be a centre for RMB business was officially launched in 2012 and encourages the growth of RMB business in British capital, Europe and globally. London’s role in the global RMB market is relatively new but it is growing strongly It brings together public and private sectors, including 12 leading global banks in the offshore yuan market, and aims to create a long-term sustainable market in Europe where financial institutions offer RMB products and services that make trade processing easier. London’s role in the global RMB market is relatively new but it is growing strongly amid a rising number of global RMB centres. According to our research, the City’s strength as the world’s leading forex centre was demonstrated by the rapid growth of RMB forex trading, with average daily volumes reaching $61.5 billion. As the market continues to develop, we expect to see more innovation in the market and larger investor demand for RMB products and services, including from institutions and corporations doing business in Britain. Two particularly significant milestones have been reached in recent years: the establishment of an official RMB clearing bank in London and the first sovereign RMB bond issuance outside of China by the British government. Britain is the fastest-growing market in Europe for RMB payments It’s encouraging to see that RMB is now the world’s fifth most-used payment currency, with the value of cross-border deals settled in RMB more than doubling last year. Britain is the fastest-growing market in Europe for RMB payments, with 28 per cent of all international RMB payments made here. Members of the City’s RMB initiative have been engaged in constructive dialogue with policymakers and businesses in China. They have been discussing areas of mutual benefit for RMB internationalisation and encouraging an exchange of information. Although RMB is not a fully convertible currency, all the signs indicate that it is moving in that direction. For example, capital account liberalisation, expanding RMB crossborder transactions and increasing RMB use as part of international reserves for some countries have been cited. The development of London’s RMB market can facilitate this process, while a thriving offshore RMB market will also benefit all participants, including London. Of course, as the international usage of RMB increases, markets will need to be served by a number of centres worldwide. London fully recognises the importance of co-ordination between financial centres and is fully open to engagement with other European and global centres.
