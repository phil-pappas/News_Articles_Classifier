Lyft started picking up passengers again earlier this month after they hammered out registration process with the state.\nOfficials support the agreements, saying they give travellers more options. But traditional taxi companies argue the newer companies have an unfair advantage because they don't have to use specialized ground transportation lanes and or obey rate caps.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:14:35.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
