(AP) â€” An aerial rope course, a rappel tower and four new treehouse-style cabins are just a few of the upgrades coming to Grand Vue Park over the next year, officials announced.\nGeneral manager Craig White and park board chairwoman Leigh Ann Scherich described the estimated $2.5 million undertaking as \"one of the most exciting changes to the park in nine years.\" The last major upgrade in 2006 included a banquet hall, three new cabins, a new playground and a new miniature golf course at a cost of $2.1 million.\nA new \"High Adventure Midway\" will include an aerial ropes course, a \"Mega Jump\" rappel tower, a giant swing, a large trampoline and a 28-foot climbing wall. All of these attractions will be located below the zip Line and old Shelter No. 1.\nThe new cabins, to be built on Cabin Drive north of the existing cabins, will be built in the form of treehouses, including two single-bedrooms and a pair of two-bedroom units. Site preparation is expected to begin within a month, according to Scherich.\nThe adventure park is expected to be complete by April, with the treehouse cabins expected to be ready by next fall.\nPark officials hope the upgrades, made possible by revenue from oil and gas leases, will allow the facility to expand its seasonal workforce by 35-40 people and to hire two to four additional full-time workers.\n\"This past year the board took on the task of a new master plan and the building of the park foundation. Also, we entered into a new partnership with Chevron and signed a complete non-surface oil and gas lease which will allow us to grow and maintain the beauty that is Grand Vue Park,\" White said.\nWhite said the projects announced last Monday are a continuation of Grand Vue Park's effort, launched in 2012 with the construction of its zipline, to brand itself as an outdoor adventure park.\n\"Since then we have added an outdoor classroom, bird feeding stations, a neutralized area to attract bees, butterflies and hummingbirds (and) a scenic overlook for fantastic passive recreation,\" he said. \"To continue with active adventures we have enhanced our walking trails with permanent benches and eight fitness stations. We have two disc golf courses, one of which is ranked No. 1 in the state of West Virginia, and we now have a 10.5-mile mountain bike loop and a paintball course, all to add to the outdoor adventure theme.\"\n___\nInformation from: The Intelligencer, http://www.theintelligencer.net", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:50:28.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
