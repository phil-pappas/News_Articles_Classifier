Waiting for a fresh corpse to prey upon, will an anonymous tip-off to the courts be enough to bring this mischievous mob to justice?\nJoin the Home of Hallowe’en from 9 October as The Edinburgh Dungeon digs up the dirt on the Resurrectionists. But be warned – when demand outstrips supply, these criminal grave robbers may even kill for a body to sell!\nEdward Evans, general manager at The Edinburgh Dungeon, commented: “There’s danger in the Dungeon at every turn this Hallowe’en with even more tricks lined up than these notorious business-men had bargained for.\n“Hallowe’en is our favourite time of year and we’re always looking to take the Dungeon experience to the next level. Making it our biggest and boldest yet, we’ve created exclusive packages for shows running until 10pm on Hallowe’en to ensure this is a fright night you won’t forget.”\nWhat’s more, The Dungeon will be making an eerie appearance at the Edinburgh-Royal Mile Starbucks this Hallowe’en, giving customers a scary fun experience in-store from 26 October. Watch out for shocks and surprises as Starbucks’ baristas ensure you aren’t left with a bad taste in your mouth with the introduction of the devilishly delicious limited-edition Vampire Frappuccino.\nWith tricks, treats and thrilling tales, The Edinburgh Dungeon opens its doors to the ‘Resurrectionists’ from 9 October to 1 November 2015. With shows running from 10am until 5pm, and with extended opening hours on 31 October, join the resurrection men as they make a woeful wage this Hallowe’en.\nIt’s all part of the non-stop action and hilarity delivered by 11 live-actor shows. With state of the art special effects, 360º theatrical sets, two heart stopping rides including an underground boat ride and fascinating storytelling by hero characters, the Dungeon delivers a truly unforgettable 80-minute interactive adventure through 1000 years of Scotland’s darker history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:28:00.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
