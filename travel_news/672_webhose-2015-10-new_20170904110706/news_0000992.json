The 565-foot tall Four Seasons tower, the fourth tallest building in Denver, held a ribbon cutting on October 19, 2010, which was attended by several dignitaries, including Governor John Hickenlooper, who was then mayor of Denver.\n \n“In the past five years since welcoming our very first guests, Four Seasons has made its mark on Denver, becoming a leader in luxury lodging and a compassionate member of our community,” remarked General Manager and Regional Vice President Thierry Kennel. “We have become a destination not only for visitors, but for local residents who are seeking the very best in spa services, elegant events, dining and cocktails.”\n \nSince its opening, the Hotel has amassed numerous awards, most notably being awarded AAA Five Diamond status in 2015. Also in 2015, Robb Report named the property to its World’s Top 100 Hotels list, and Travel + Leisure World’s Best Awards ranked the Hotel as #20 Top Large City Hotel in the US.\n \nRecently, Four Seasons Founder and Chairman Isadore Sharp visited the Hotel to award several employees for five years of service. Opening the first Four Seasons in 1961, a modest motor hotel in Toronto, Sharp spoke to the Hotel’s staff on the reason for the company’s success – a single principle, the Golden Rule.\n \n“It’s the Golden Rule – the simple idea that if you treat people well, the way you would like to be treated, they will do the same,” Sharp said.The evening of October 23, the Hotel will hold a Five-Year Anniversary Party, open to public, in EDGE Bar. Featuring a DJ, cocktails specials and more, this free event is a thank you to the Denver community for its support since 2010.\n \nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:31:23.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
