On Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, the park becomes a more intense experience, with outdoor scare zones, haunted houses and edgy shows. \nGreat America in Santa Clara, Calif., also offers family friendly activities during the day, while nighttime thrills include roving monsters, nine mazes, scare zones and the park's thrill rides. \nCarowinds park in Charlotte, N.C., recommends its Scarowinds extravaganza -- including a homecoming at Zombie High -- for guests age 13 and older. \nBusch Gardens Tampa partnered with Robin Cowie, producer of The Blair Witch Project, to create \"Unearthed,\" about a woman named Scarlett who comes back to life after a construction crew digs too far. Busch Gardens Williamsburg gets scary with five Terror-tories and seven haunted houses. \nHAUNTWORLD'S TOP 15 \nHauntWorld.com 's list of top 15 haunted houses is topped by Haunted Overload, in Lee, N.H., described as \"an original outdoor haunt in a class of its own\" with \"handmade sets, gigantic monsters and spellbinding costumes with spectacular sound and lighting ... set in an eerie dark New England forest.\" Haunted Overload also won a $50,000 prize, named America's scariest display by ABC's The Great Halloween Fright Fight. \nThe other 14 on HauntWorld's list are Headless Horseman, in Ulster Park, N.Y.; The 13th Gate in Baton Rouge, La.; the Dent Schoolhouse in Cincinnati; Netherworld in Atlanta; 13th Floor, San Antonio, Texas; Bennett's Curse in Baltimore; Erebus, Pontiac, Mich.; Bates Motel, Philadelphia; The Darkness, St. Louis; Cutting Edge, Dallas; Spookywoods, Greensboro, N.C.; House of Torment in Chicago; Hex House, Tulsa, Okla.; and Fear Experience in Cleveland. \nUNIVERSAL'S HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS \nAt Universal theme parks in Orlando and Los Angeles, Halloween Horror Nights draw thousands of visitors, ranking among the parks' busiest times of year. \nThe experience is worthy of Hollywood, inspired by famous horror films, sci-fi shows and tales, with movie-quality special effects, technology, sets, costumes and makeup. \nAt Universal Hollywood in L.A., the extravaganza includes a new \"terror tram\" experience through Universal's film studio backlot themed on The Purge, a film about a 12-hour period in which crime is legal. \nThere are also six themed mazes based on movies and TV shows: The Walking Dead, Insidious, Crimson Peak, Halloween, This Is The End and Alien vs. Predator. Crimson Peak, for example, is inspired by a horror movie being released in mid-October by director Guillermo del Toro, taking visitors on a journey with the main character, Edith Cushing, to a haunted estate in the English countryside. The Walking Dead maze is based on season five of the AMC series. \nUniversal Orlando, which is marking its 25th year of Halloween Horror Nights, has nine haunted houses, including \"Freddy vs. Jason,\"\"The Purge,\"\"An American Werewolf in London\" and \"The Walking Dead.\" The Florida park also has five scare zones. \nREGIONAL \nEastern State Penitentiary, the historic former prison in Philadelphia, is celebrating its 25th season hosting Halloween madness. Its massive haunted house, \"Terror Behind the Walls,\" has been redesigned for the anniversary. \nIn Reading, Pa., Shocktoberfest offers Zombie World and Prison of the Dead Escape, which requires guests to escape from multiple rooms. Because November's calendar has a Friday the 13th in it, the attraction will stay open through that date. \nIn Pittsburgh, ScareHouse attractions include The Summoning, a haunted attraction set in October 1932 that tells a story of secret societies, rituals and demonic inhabitants. \nSixteen miles west of Detroit, the Hush Haunted Attraction's Detroit Experiment Facility brings visitors through the collapsed ceilings, overgrown greenery and flickering dungeons of a science facility where experiments have gone wrong. \nFreakshow in Wabash Valley, Ill., introduces guests to sideshow freaks including evil magicians, mimes and clowns. \nWisconsin FearGrounds in Waukesha, just outside Milwaukee, offers three haunted houses. \nAt Lookout Mountain in Ruby Falls, Tenn., Haunted Cavern includes one haunt in the mind of a madman and one in a cave featuring creepy night creatures. \nEnigma Haunt in Boca Raton, Fla., has a blackout maze, The Abyss, and themed chambers in the Realms of Terror. \nAttractions at Spooky World Presents Nightmare New England in Litchfield, N.H., include a tractor ride through the woods to a spider-infested campground, plane crash scene and torture compound, along with a showcase of \"rejected carnival misfits ... clowns to demented sideshow freaks.\" \nFinally, the annual New Hampshire Pumpkin Festival isn't supposed to be scary, but last year's was marred by alcohol-fueled parties and 100 arrests. It's relocating this year from Keene to Laconia. Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:52:59.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
