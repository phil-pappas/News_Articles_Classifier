Burglars and thieves typically rely on stealth to meet their objectives, but since 2002, reports reflect an increasing use of knives and handguns in the commission of crimes. Further, high-traffic business areas commonly frequented by tourists are targeted for opportunistic street crimes like purse snatching and pick-pocketing. Perpetrators committing street crimes in the public eye can become confrontational, but mostly they avoid gratuitous violence, which draws attention to them.\" \nMoreover, \"Generally, numbers of uniformed police are inadequate to have a substantial influence on crime deterrence and uniformed police response to alarms or emergency calls is often too slow (15 minutes or longer) to disrupt crimes in progress.\" \nThese facts are worth bearing in mind as you plan your Caribbean trip -- not to discourage you from traveling, but so that you take the standard security precautions seriously when traveling to a destination known to have a significant crime problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:21:20.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
