But the region where Urnaesch is located, Appenzellerland , is particularly fascinating. It is one of Switzerland’s least explored areas, and the pace of change seems to match the inching of glaciers across the Alps – grindingly slow, even by the standards of conservative Switzerland. \nAlthough Swiss women won the right to vote on the federal level in 1971, Appenzell’s two sub-cantons, or localities, were the last in the nation to concede women a vote in 1989 and 1990. \nIn Urnaesch, the cow-welcoming processions followed a firmly established order. \nFirst came a young boy in yellow Lederhosen, an embroidered red vest and knee-high white socks, then a little girl in a striped frock, tending a flock of tiny white goats, then a herdsman in full traditional garb matching the boy’s, plus a black hat festooned with flowers and elaborate metalwork decorating his suspenders, pipe or watch-chain. Then came the cows deemed most perfect in body and milk production, bearing the heavy clanging bells on colourful, intricately worked leather collars. \nFinally, the yodellers: four farmers walking side by side in red and black outfits. Their singing kept the animals together and moving down the mountain. \nThe rest of the herd followed, capped by a farmer leading the bull and a cart with carved wooden moulds and implements used in butter-and cheesemaking. \nVillagers greeted the herders with glasses of fresh-pressed apple juice, wine or beer. \nAn alphorn trio from Basel played their four-metre-long instruments as the village waited for each of the nine herds to descend. The alphorn’s loud, mellow call can be heard for miles. \nThe effect of three of them harmonizing in Urnaesch’s cosy, cobblestoned village square could be felt as much as heard. \nThe region is no longer dependent on cattle for survival, and modern comforts like indoor heating have softened the impact of weather. \nBut the rituals that have set the rhythms of life for centuries here remain important markers of identity to many Appenzellers, said Erika Kist, of the Museum for Appenzeller Traditions . \nThe museum, in a 400-year-old house, offers a wealth of information and careful displays of traditional life, arts and crafts. \nIn addition to the descent of cows at the end of summer, Appenzellerland hosts cattle shows in the fall, celebration of the herds’ ascent to the high pastures in spring, and ancient mid-winter rites in which men dress up in fearsome costumes and carouse in the pre-dawn hours to scare away evil spirits. \nThe herders’ costumes are not just worn to entertain tourists. The costly outfits are also used in special occasions like weddings, church services or other folk celebrations, Kist said. \nOnce the cows were through, piglet races commenced and food stands sold beer, fruit cordials, dried or cured meats, and sausages sizzling on grills. \nThe redolent Appenzeller cheese was everywhere, and the smell of it roasted to melting drew a long line of fans for raclette – bubbling, crusty cheese scraped onto slices of bread. It’s another tradition that clearly has a long life ahead. \nIF YOU GO \nAlpine Festivals: Schedule, myswitzerland.com \nMuseum for Appenzeller Traditions: museum-urnaesch.ch \nAppenzellerland Tourism:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:25:48.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
