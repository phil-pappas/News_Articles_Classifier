Mo Luong Cave is also known as Hang Bo Doi (Solider Cave). Bo Luong means a big water source. According to a legend, on every Tet holiday (Vietnamese Lunar New Year), Thai ethnic people go to deep streams in the region to catch fish. One time, there was a woman who caught an egg three times. After each time seeing that egg, finally, she decided to bring that egg home. Then, the egg turned into a snake. Since the appearance of this snake, the water level in rice fields raised. Wherever the snake was taken, the water level raised, creating favorable conditions for locals to expand lands and cultivate into fertile fields. To express gratitude to the snake, locals brought it to Mo Luong Cave, and then the snake turned into a dragon there. Annually, on the full moon of the seventh lunar month, there are swarms of fish appearing from the cave.
