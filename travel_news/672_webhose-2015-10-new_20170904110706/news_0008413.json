Its 300-plus exhibits offer an unprecedented insight into the shadowy world of spies.\nThe Spy Museum Berlin throws a light on the history of espionage, which dates back further than you might think.\nTake a journey through the ages accompanied by spooks, spies and secret agents, from the Middle Ages to modern day. Witness accounts and agent profiles are presented in a fun and educational way, revealing the Stasi’s secret techniques, and explaining how people were silenced or made to talk.\nBerlin was known as the capital of espionage from the start of the Cold War through to reunification, when the secret services of NATO and the Warsaw Pact were spying on each other here. And it seems that hasn’t changed much to this day: few other cities are subject to as much spying and eavesdropping as the capital of Germany.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:18:39.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
