Gazpromneft-Aero’s partnership with ENOC (the Emirates National Oil Company) enables flights to operate from Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport to international airports in Doha and New Delhi. \nIn 2013, Gazpromneft-Aero and ENOC Aviation signed an agreement permitting the two companies to operate within the same airports. The agreement allows Gazpromneft-Aero’s Russian customers the ability to refuel in UAE airports, and ENOC Aviation customers in airports where Gazpromneft-Aero operates in Russia and the CIS. Currently the Gazpromneft-Aero aviation refueling network includes seven airports located in the UAE’s key tourist and business centers. \nVladimir Egorov, CEO of Gazpromneft-Aero, said: “We plan to develop our partnership with ENOC Aviation and offer long-term agreements to international airlines for fuel supply in Russia and abroad. Increasing our refueling volumes for QATAR Airways and Air India will strengthen Gazpromneft-Aero’s position in the international aviation fuel supply market. Our strategy is to develop partnerships with direct aviation fuel suppliers in countries with high levels of inbound tourism such as in the Middle East and India where the air transport market is rapidly developing. Flights provided by domestic carriers give Russian tourists the option of connecting flights via New Delhi and Qatar to Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Osaka, Sydney and Melbourne.” \nFarid Al Bastaki, Senior Manager, Aviation Fuel Marketing at ENOC Aviation, said: “Russia and the CIS are a strategic market for ENOC Aviation and we are proud to be a partner of Gazpromneft-Aero who have consistently provided a high level of refueling services to ENOC Aviation customers. Through this collaboration, we are able to operate within the same airports, allowing refueling to our customers in airports across the UAE, Russia and CIS. With the help of Gazpromneft-Aero, we have achieved consistent growth in sales and we hope to continue recording significant milestones and successes on the long run.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:00:26.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
