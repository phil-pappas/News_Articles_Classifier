Long the primary tourism domain name for national governments, such as Egypt.travel and Germany.travel, the .travel top level domain provides a clear travel industry identity that doesn't leave smaller travel businesses in a confusing mix with thousands of unrelated industries. Ten years of history and success now provide .travel registrants an important level of confidence as many hundreds of new top level domains enter the market. \nOn its ten-year anniversary, TRMC would like to thank its many accredited registrars and many thousands of long-term registrants for their years of support. \nUnder its 2015 Registry Agreement Tralliance will continue to focus exclusively on the travel industry working with its industry partners to develop domain name services that will support new and existing registrants over the coming decade. \nFor more information, contact: email", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:11:47.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
