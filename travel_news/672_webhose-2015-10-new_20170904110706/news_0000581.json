From Branwen ferch Llŷr to Gwenllian, and Llywelyn the Great to Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, the audio guides each link to a specific theme on the Wales History Map, and can be downloaded and listened to while exploring sites.\nAnd to help visitors get in the mood for historic adventures, the Welsh government has collaborated with Trac Cymru (Music Traditions Wales) to create the Ultimate Welsh Road Trip Soundtrack. Featuring songs from the likes of Welsh songstress Duffy and award-winning folk group 9Bach, the soundtrack includes a playlist of songs by Welsh artists to complement the historic themes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:23:26.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
