For more than a century, its contents have been shrouded in mystery, earning it the nickname “the Black Museum.” Access to this facility in New Scotland Yard is strictly controlled and typically reserved for police officers and lawyers. Mere curiosity seekers need not apply.\nNow, for the first time, the Museum of London is shedding light on this collection, enabling the public to see how real cases were investigated and examine damning evidence used to secure convictions.\n“These are objects that victims used, that criminals used, and tools that police have used to solve crimes,” says Julia Hoffbrand, who co-curated “The Crime Museum Uncovered” with Jackie Keily. “They’re powerful objects,” Keily says, “and they’ve got interesting stories to tell.”\nThe exhibit spans more than a century, from a pistol employed in an 1840 assassination attempt on Queen Victoria to police reconstructions of the explosives-laden backpacks that killed 52 people in the “7/7” London bombings of 2005. Hangmen’s ropes, post-mortem masks of executed prisoners and rubber gloves used by “Acid Bath Murderer” John Haigh in 1949 are among the more macabre objects on display. Others include a 1946 forensics kit, a briefcase containing a syringe and poison intended to silence a witness in the Kray brothers’ trial, and a stash of champagne bottles and Old Spice aftershave found in the Great Train Robbery gang’s hideout in 1963.\nThe “Swanson Marginalia,” however, are likely to provoke the keenest interest. These are handwritten notes by Inspector Donald Swanson, one of the original investigators charged with hunting down Jack the Ripper, in which he names his chief suspect, a man called Kosminski. It’s thought to refer to Aaron Kosminski, an immigrant from Russian Poland who suffered from insanity and died in 1919. No one was ever charged with the murders.\n“If you’re someone who follows this case, these are iconic notes,” Hoffbrand says. “It’s a direct link to somebody who was there and involved in the actual investigation.” Criminals like Jack the Ripper and the Kray brothers have become film and television fodder, so “it’s easy to put a gloss of glamour on them,” Keily says. “But they weren’t glamorous. They were gangsters and criminals, and sometimes, they were murderers. People lived in fear of them. What we shouldn’t lose sight of is the victims and the detectives who were involved in trying to solve these cases, as well.”\nAmy Laughinghouse is a London freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:34:50.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
