(Angela Hill/Bay Area News Group) Click photo to enlarge The Ghost Tour of Old Monterey takes spirit seekers around town on a motorized trolley. « 3 » Under the swollen sallow scowl of last month's super moon, we drove to Old Monterey and into an otherworld. \nSkulking spirits of bygone banditos, Spanish explorers, swindling sailors, Italian priests and long-suffering ladies are said to lurk in the aged adobes, graveyards, jails and saloons in this historic part of town, just blocks from the chowder and chatter of Cannery Row. \nOne might say it's ... uncanny. \nFor those who dare, there are several ways to explore. You can take a nonspooky, daytime history tour -- Monterey State Historic Park offers a variety of strolls through many of the historic buildings, most for about $5. Or you can go straight for the scary stuff on the Saturday night Ghost Tour of Old Monterey, a $33, 90-minute ramble through the shadowy streets on a motorized cable car, driven by the enthusiastic and slightly crazy Gary Munsinger, who started giving tours a dozen years ago after he went on a Jack the Ripper expedition in London. \nMunsinger gets great reviews online. We found his stories a bit convoluted at times, but it's still fun to ride around these spooky places, occasionally stopping to get out, peer into darkened alcoves and hunt for haunts. Bring flashlights, and be on time -- he gets the trolley and the creepy music rolling promptly at 8 p.m. \nIt was a beautiful night for morbid meanderings. We rode past the infamous Perry House, the city's first wood-frame home, built in 1860 by whaling Capt. Manuel Perry. A back bedroom upstairs was the scene of a passionate murder when a young female tenant was strangled by a jealous boyfriend. Advertisement \n\"God's true story, they caught him and hung him the next day, and that's when the ghost of the young woman began appearing in that room,\" Munsinger says to several \"oohs\" from our group of 16 as we looked up at the lit windows, hoping to get a scare. \nNothing materialized, so we rolled on to Dutra Street for more stories of the dramatically departed at the Old Monterey Jail, built in 1854 and in use for 100 years. No one ever escaped its granite-and-iron walls. But plenty met their end just steps away at The Hanging Tree, a massive cypress looming large in the gloom. We all \"oohed\" some more and took photos. One woman swore she got orbs on her iPhone. \nThe tree rises up next to the Vazquez Adobe, now home to Monterey's recreation department offices and rather tame by day, but some say nightfall brings out the mind-muddled sister of the notorious and glamorous bandit Tiburcio Vasquez (said to be the inspiration for Zorro). His sister, crazed after her brother's death, still lingers on the second-floor veranda. \"People have seen her 80 percent solid, to the point where they could describe the embroidery on her dress,\" Munsinger says. \"God's true story.\" The historic Stokes Adobe, which now houses Restaurant 1833, is said to be one of Monterey's most haunted buildings and is a popular stop on the Ghost Tour of Old Monterey. (Angela Hill/Bay Area News Group) \nWe stopped for a restroom break and another tale of trauma at Restaurant 1833 at Hartnell and Polk streets, now a hip, popular dinner spot and said to be the most paranormally active building in town. I didn't see any ghosts in the unisex bathroom, but there have long been reports of flickering lights, stealthy footsteps and slamming doors, allegedly thanks to the misdeeds of James Stokes. The English sailor jumped ship, passed himself off as a doctor, bought the adobe and practiced curiously effective medicine -- effectively killing off a good number of patients, according to Munsinger. Stokes later offed himself with some of his own poison, er, medicine after he was caught assaulting his daughter. He's still there -- and still pretty ticked off about it all. \nOur final destination, so to speak, was the old Monterey cemetery, the resting place for well-known pioneers and villainous outlaws alike. The trolley's headlights swept f pale wash over worn tombstones and angel-clad mausoleums. The supermoon added its ghoulish glow. \nWe rode back to our cars, checking our photos for orbs. The only orb on mine was the bald head of the guy sitting in front of me. Munsinger dropped us off and drove into the night. Everyone made it out alive. God's true story.
