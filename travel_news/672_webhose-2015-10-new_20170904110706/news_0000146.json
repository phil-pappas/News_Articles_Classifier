Photo: Courtesy Russ & Jill Sartori Often-overlooked Slovenia worth a trip 1  /  1 Back to Gallery Why we went: We have an American friend who recently moved to Slove nia. This often overlooked country has much to offer, with abundant natural beauty and \na lovely capital city, \nLjubljana.\nDon’t miss: The Skocjan Caves in Slovenia’s Karst region are absolutely incredible. The caves, on the UNESCO list of world heritage sites, comprise one of the world’s largest underground river canyons.\nDon’t bother: Touring the museums in Ljubljana. Your time is better spent strolling the town center and exploring the interesting squares and architectural highlights, including the Art Nouveau buildings and Joze Plecnik’s many contributions to the city.\nCoolest souvenir: Hand-painted replicas of beehive front boards that reflect an important part of Slovenia’s tradition of beekeeping and that are the visual, cultural equivalent of folk songs, poetry and fairy tales.\nWorth a splurge: A day or overnight trip to Piran, a picturesque town situated on the southern tip of Slovenia on the Adriatic coast.\nWish we’d packed: More waterproof hiking clothes. Slovenia gets lots of rain throughout the year, as evidenced by its lush landscape and abundant rivers and lakes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:53:06.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
