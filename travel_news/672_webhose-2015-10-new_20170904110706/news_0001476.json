Would these lines work on you? By Laura Reilly 16 October 2015 \nImagine that it’s your first night in Valencia, and you’re soaking in the buzzing atmosphere of the Plaza de La Reina over tapas and sangria. A handsome stranger spies you from across the bar, makes his way over and coolly hits you with a pickup line. Your Spanish isn’t the greatest, but under the warm lights of the plaza, it’s the most romantic thing you’ve ever heard. \nDo you have a coin? I need to call my mom and tell her I've found my match. \nFalling in love while travelling is easy – everything you do and everyone you meet is full of possibilities. And generally, almost all foreign flings start with a pickup line. \nFrom cheesy to downright inappropriate, we love that these brave souls shared the best (and worst) pickup lines they've heard around the world. And we love even more that some of our readers have turned those fleeting romances into lifetime loves. \nI must have said something right all those years ago. \n“I met my wife on the back of an overland truck from Nairobi to Victoria Falls,” Phil Kimberlee said. “Five weeks on the road… now 13 years married with three kids later – I must have said something right all those years ago.” \nWhile on holiday in Rio de Janeiro, British traveller Kwok Ng thought it would be rude to cancel an unwanted hostel reservation under such short notice. “At the other end, my future wife from Brazil wasn’t supposed to be in Rio, but due to her best friend bailing out on her, she ended up staying at the same hostel.” After maintaining a long-distance relationship for years, the two made a lifetime reservation of their own.

Just somewhere on the warm beautiful sea.” Related: An incredible inflight love story \nSometimes getting the aisle seat can change your flight plan forever.

Did it start with a fun pickup line? Was it as fleeting as your time abroad, or did it last a lifetime? Let us know in the poll below.
