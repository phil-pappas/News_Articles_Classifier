Cycling Singaporeâ€™s Heritage Trail runs for four hours through Chinatown, Little India, Fullerton Bay and Marina Bay, from 7.45am. Also setting off at that time is a full-day tour that follows the Park Connector Network, a cycle path that connects 100 parks around Singapore, for 120km. Finally, a 20km night tour runs along illuminated riverside trails and bike paths from 6.45pm. All three start from Shimano Cycling World, near the Stadium MRT station, or you can be picked up from your hotel for an extra fee. Prices, including guide, bike, helmet and refreshments, are about HK$900 for the full-day tour and HK$385 for the heritage and night tours.
