The serene look also is a soothing respite from the bustle outdoors – Le Germain is two blocks from Union Station and across the street from Air Canada Centre . \nThe hotel is moderately priced for its pivotal location, luxe interiors and attentive service. The sleek rooms start at $269 and suites at about $400, which includes lots of perks, including a gourmet continental breakfast, Lacoste sports gear on loan for the fitness room, freshly baked cookies after lunch and Sleep-In Sundays, which is a late-checkout, if available. \nToronto is the fourth largest city in North America in population after Mexico City, New York and Los Angeles, and a larger five-star international chain hotel might run $400-$700 for a room and $700-$1,000 for a suite. \nI received a pre-arrival email from Le Germain asking for my preferences, so I requested – and received – decaf pods for my Nespresso machine, a down pillow and a reservation for supper at Play . \nFOOD AND DRINK \nPlay is the hotel’s dining and drinking lounge, decked out in smart black and white with low-backed leather bar stools and high-topped tables. Most of the lounging travellers – 90 per cent men on my visit – are fixated on their laptops or the flat-screen TVs. \nThe bar has good wines by the glass and local Steam Whistle beer on tap and the boutique menu features bison sliders, crab cakes, peppers stuffed with quinoa and black bean purée, chicken and andouille sausage gumbo, and, a nod to Quebec, poutine. \nThe concert and game nights at Air Canada are crazy, but so much fun at Play, before and after the action. Madonna was on stage a few weeks ago, Paul McCartney plays Oct. 17, The Who on Oct. 19, NBA’s Raptors on the Oct. 18 and 28, and the Toronto Maple Leafs on the Oct. 26 and 31. \nInspired by pro sports, the hotel’s event spaces are named the Offensive Zone, the Defensive Zone and the new All-Star Room, an ultra-modern venue for weddings or meetings. \nBreakfast is served in the MVP room, a bright mezzanine lounge. A large European-style buffet of cold treats is included for all guests: fruit, yogurt, charcuterie, cheese, breads, jams, with tea and cappuccino. You can also order such hot dishes ($7 to $11) as Germain’s pain perdu dipped in custard, smoked salmon on a brioche or a spinach and cheese omelette. \nTHE GUEST ROOMS \nThe 167 rooms and suites are spacious and sleek, with clean lines and large windows. The flatscreen TV is tucked into a wall niche and the mini-bar and tech outlets are hidden in the long modular desk, so the lean look is unmarred. \nThe one point of drama is the artwork. Each room is graced by one mural-sized, black and white image by Toronto photographer Matthew Plexman. The images are close-ups of real-life NHL and NBA players in training – artistically detailing the ripped abs and bulging biceps of the elite athletes, with evocative lighting and composition. \nOn the practical side, the guest rooms have user-friendly, bedside lighting control panels and the bathrooms have over-sized sinks, bath-showers and large vanities with posh Molton Brown toiletries. The WCs are private, with extra phones. The beds are so comforting that Le Germain sells all of its bedding, right down to the mattresses. I was smothered in a goose down duvet, with Egyptian cotton sheets by Frette and a dark blanket folded at the end of the bed – a subtle addition by Montreal designer Marie Saint Pierre. \nThe room key card activates the lighting system, part of the hotel’s eco-plan that includes thermal windows, air and water filtration, filtration, heat and hot water recovery and dual flush toilets. \nIF YOU GO \nLe Germain Hotel Maple Leaf Square: 888-940-7575, 416 649-7575, legermainhotels.com ; 75 Bremner Blvd., Toronto, Ont.
