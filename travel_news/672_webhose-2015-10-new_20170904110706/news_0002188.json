But family had come first. Sam was out for a meal for his mum Julie's birthday and if you know how close they are as a family, you know that Julie will be right up high on Sam's agenda. We had kids at the school bringing in their shirts. They were printing off pictures, bringing in rugby balls. I even had Year 11 girls knocking on my door and asking repeatedly: “Is Sam Burgess coming in?” It was the talk of the school all day Friday. Sam has got to focus on a goal and he won't be affected by what anyone says to him I believe Sam had planned on coming in on the Friday and bringing loads of merchandise. But Sam has promised he will visit the school, and as you'll know from my reports in the last few weeks, Sam alone has turned this school into a place where the player himself, and rugby union, has garnered many curious new fans. However, Sam's younger brother Will came in to see us last Tuesday. He did exactly what Sam would have done, really. He came down and spoke to us and had pictures taken with kids. He spent about an hour and a half in the staff room talking about his time in Australia and about Sam. Will explained that Sam was thoroughly enjoying the experience, that there was a complete buzz pre-game and then coming out to the atmosphere at Twickenham was something special. He has found it an emotional experience. He didn't really elaborate too much more than that. We hear that Sam is in good spirits. He said there's a little bit of negativity but that might just be down to the fact people don't like someone new coming in and stealing the limelight. It seems like Sam was being used as a bit of a scapegoat and he's taken some unfair criticism. But Sam will not have taken any notice of it. He's very strong-willed and has a strong personality. Training day: Sam and Will at Dewsbury Moor I'll be brutally honest, there was a lot of media coverage in Australia when he was over there and he won't be watching any TV or picking up any newspapers. He won't be listening to anything that's being said. He's single-minded, he's got to focus on a goal and he won't be affected by what anyone says to him. That was evident when he was at school here. He'd knock down all barriers that came his way. All I would say is this to any of his detractors: a lot of people had never heard of Sam Burgess before Rugby World Cup 2015 . A lot of the kids at our school are rugby league fans and did know Sam Burgess, as we are in the heartland of the sport, but what was most evident is that we have had girls getting interested in the game. That's a massive thing. We've never had any girls groups playing rugby or anything close to that at the school. On Friday, when we had groups of girls asking where Sam Burgess was... it's because the girls want to start a rugby team. That's because we've built up the hype and the atmosphere in school to such a degree that they love it. Will and Sam have already been instrumental in going out there and doing sessions with girls' rugby, and we'd love our girls to take up the sport. Because of our local hero, it has raised the profile of the game in this area to new levels. There isn't a lot of rugby union up north going on in schools. It's certainly raised the profile and raised our awareness, from us PE teachers' point of view. It's something we want to get into our curriculum now. It's exciting really. It creates a little bit more diversity for the kids. That would not have happened at all if it had not been for Sam Burgess. It's been an incredible impact Sam has had on the school. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:56:09.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
