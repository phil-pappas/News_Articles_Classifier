It correctly matched all five white balls drawn, 09-19-33-38-54, but not the red Powerball, 15, to win a prize of $1 million , less 25 percent federal withholding.\nBecause the ticket's one-year expiration date falls on a Sunday, a prize claim must be filed with the Lottery by Friday, November 6 .\nThe Pennsylvania Lottery encourages claimants to sign the back of the ticket, call the Lottery at 717-702-8146 and file a timely claim at any of Lottery's seven area offices or at Lottery headquarters in Middletown , Dauphin County . Claims may be filed Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. at area Lottery offices and from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. at headquarters.\nBy law, unclaimed, expired lottery prizes remain in the Lottery Fund and are used to support programs benefiting older Pennsylvanians. Although some lotteries give players only 90 or 180 days to claim a prize, the Pennsylvania Lottery allows prizes to be claimed up to one year from the drawing date.\nPlayers are reminded to check every ticket, every time, at self-service scanners located at retailers and also found on Lottery self-service play terminals. The Lottery reminds players to sign tickets immediately upon their purchase for proof of ownership.\nAbout the Pennsylvania Lottery : The Pennsylvania Lottery remains the only state lottery that designates all its proceeds to programs that benefit older residents.
