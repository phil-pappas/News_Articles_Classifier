From its type, archaeologists estimate it to be from around 750 AD -- making it approximately 1,265 years old -- but warn that this is not an exact date.\nSwords like this were status symbols in Viking times because of the high cost of extracting iron, Ekerhovd said, and it's likely this blade would have belonged to a wealthy individual.\nThe artifact has now been handed over to the University Museum of Bergen for preservation work and a research expedition to the discovery site is planned for next spring.\n\"We are really happy that this person found the sword and gave it to us,\" said Ekerhovd. \"It will shed light on our early history.
