With the new service, passengers just need to fly 6.5 hours from Beijing to the \"Kingdom of Rubber\" for its many sights and sounds, including Kuala Lumpur's amazing skyline dominated by the Twin Towers. \nKuala Lumpur is Malaysia's capital as well as the political, financial, commercial and cultural center. It's a culturally diverse city where gorgeous European castles, elegant mosques and quaint Chinese homes are everywhere. It's a scenic city where the top of Genting Highlands' rolling hills affords breathtaking views with banks of clouds and tonic fresh air for company. It's a modern city where pedestrian and vehicular traffic flows endlessly in different directions on neon-lit streets at night. This international metropolis that exudes both eastern and western charms is truly worth a dedicated trip. \nRecently, Malaysia has been a red-hot destination that holds a powerful appeal for Chinese travelers. The latest statistics from Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) suggest that passenger arrivals and departures at Malaysian airport are expected to reach 85.8 million in 2015, up 3.0% over 2014. With Air China's Beijing-Kuala Lumpur service, which will be the first of the kind linking the northern part of China to Malaysia and an additional travel option, travelers residing in Beijing and the neighboring regions can easily fly to Malaysia and connect via Kuala Lumpur to other cities of Southeast Asia, and, at the same time, travelers close to Malaysia can easily connect to other parts of the world via Air China's hub in Beijing. \nMalaysia used to be an important pit-stop on ancient China's \"Silk Road on the Sea\", playing an important role in the East-West commercial and cultural exchanges. Today, the country located in Southeast Asia's core zone is connected to other ASEAN countries by sea and overland, and is an important part of the \"21st Century Silk Road on the Sea\". In 2014, imports and exports between Malaysia and China exceeded RMB100 billion, and Malaysia remained China's largest trading partner among ASEAN countries. Air China's forthcoming Beijing-Kuala Lumpur nonstop service, a timely response to the Chinese government's strategic \"One Belt, One Road\" initiative, will become a thoroughfare in the air that promotes the cooperation in the fields of economy, trading and investment between the two countries and adds impetus to the growth of the local economy. \nThe introduction of Beijing-Kuala Lumpur service is one of Air China's important moves to pursue its global strategy, expand its route network serving the Asia Pacific region and cement its global presence with its hub in Beijing. Air China will follow the launch of Beijing-Kuala Lumpur service with the introduction of Beijing-Mumbai, Beijing-Colombo and Beijing- Islamabad-Karachi routes. These new routes to be started will bring the number of destinations in the Asia Pacific region that the carrier serves up to 19. Air China's attentive services will offer truly pleasant travel experiences to passengers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:18:53.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
