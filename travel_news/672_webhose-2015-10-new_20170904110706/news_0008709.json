With two-thirds of the UK’s small and medium-sized businesses expecting to increase turnover in the next 12 months, many are set to enjoy that brilliant sensation of an organisation on the up. Sometimes, though, the progress of a business can be accelerated by seizing upon an exciting and unexpected turn of events. What would you do if you were called on, out of the blue, to deliver the “elevator pitch”? Would you sell yourself short? Or would you secure the investment and create the impetus to rise to the next level? That’s the question at the heart of HSBC’s Elevator, a campaign supporting British businesses across three areas. First is the Elevator Pitch Competition, which is offering the UK’s most ambitious small businesses the chance to take home £150,000 in cash – as long as their pitch is right. Second is the Elevator Talks. These events will champion the human side of business, telling inspirational stories of success that go beyond the numbers. Speakers will highlight the personal and business factors that drive growth and share their stories of taking businesses to the top. Not that there’s ever time to just enjoy the ride. There is hard work throughout, and that’s why the Telegraph and HSBC have created the Elevator Guides, with practical advice from entrepreneurs and investors that can inspire and inform business leaders – whichever stage their business is at. From top tips on how to pitch to body language lessons and how to set up your first office, take a look at the Telegraph hub and HSBC’s Knowledge Centre for everything you’ll need to turn opportunities into reality.
