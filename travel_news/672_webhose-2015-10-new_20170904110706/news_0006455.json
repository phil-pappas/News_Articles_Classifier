Beginning Nov. 22, he’ll switch on the lights at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, where visitors after dark will see 58 columns of light and 30,000 glowing spheres representing blooming flowers across the cactus-picketed grounds. The exhibit runs through May 8, 2016. Nearby in Scottsdale, the artist will sink circular arrays of fiber optic poles in the Arizona Canal resembling colorful spouts or lily pads. The exhibit, called Blooms , will glow nightly from early November through February. ...AND THE OUTBACK The globe-trotting Mr. Munro will again pop up next spring, this time Down Under in a new installation at Ayers Rock Resort. Field of Light , a solar-powered installation, will illuminate Australia’s red center near Uluru with 50,000 stems topped by glowing orbs. Visitors will be able to witness the spectacle at night or at sunrise, on foot, by camel or via helicopter. The show will run for one year, April 1, 2016, to March 31, 2017. Near the Australian icon, the resort, which encompasses five accommodations options from a luxury hotel to a campground, has also announced other events , including the Desert Dreaming Yoga Festival. Slated for April 24 to 29, 2016, the gathering will feature yoga, meditation and nutrition classes. The second Touch the Silence Within Wellness Weekend, May 13 to 15, 2016, will focus on alternative healing practices such as mindfulness, Qigong and guided meditation.
