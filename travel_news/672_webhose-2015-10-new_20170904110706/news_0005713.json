Stepping out of a downpour into a room showcasing my first ever in-the-flesh Diego Rivera mural sent my eyes into overdrive trying to capture and interpret every single detail. In La Casa Azul I overindulged in all things Frida Kahlo, before heading to the Museo Nacional de Antropología to pore over the exquisite embroidery, sculptures and jewels. Not far from away is Teotihuacan, where you can admire and wonder at the skills of the Mesoamericans in assembling complex and imposing pyramid structures. The coriander-laced food, the art of the ceremonies performed by the traditional medicine men in the grand Zócalo city square, and the vibrant festivals make el Distrito Federal de México an unmissable living, breathing exhibition of Mexican life and culture. Harriette Newcombe, from London, wins a voucher with DialAFlight Follow the Frida Kahlo art trail in Mexico City Photo: Alamy More feedback from readers Barcelona Art is at the core of the city. Look around and you see breathtaking works towering from the ground by Gaudí. Step into buildings to see exquisite ceilings representing Catalan modernism by Lluís Domènech i Montaner. Take a tour of El Born and the Gothic neighbourhoods and see historical street art that has weathered the elements and become part of the landscape. The Picasso museum is an obvious and outstanding collection of art in Barcelona but the city is so much more than paintings hung on walls. An atmosphere of open expression, people buzzing with ideas – it oozes the very nature of art and inspires you with the passion to create. Suzanne Smith, Wigan Sahara Many bone-shaking miles of corrugated, sandy track were endured to reach the green oasis of Djanet, lying beneath the sandstone towers of the Saharan Tassili n’Ajjer mountains. More scorching miles followed, trekking to and climbing the steep, heat-shattered ravines, which led to a plateau and the amazing rock art of the Jabbaren, and Tamrit areas. Camels are unwilling mountaineers, and carried our gear with raucous complaints and threatening displays of unpleasant, yellow teeth, urged upward by whistles and prodding from our guide. The ancient frescoes, originally discovered by a Foreign Legionnaire in 1933, depict human life, and animals from the distant past, when the climate was more benign and cattle, elephant and giraffe roamed the area. The paintings and engravings, some up to 6,000 years old, are found on waterworn rock overhangs, and are thus protected from weathering. The inspiring scenery, stillness, and ancient artwork induce a profound feeling of awe. JA Lomax, Powys Statues in Piazza della Signoria Photo: Getty Florence Try the Cappelle Medicee, and see “Night” and “Day” languishing on a tomb (by Michelangelo). An easy walk from here is the Palazzo Medici and the magical, teeny Chapel of the Magi, with four walls painted by Gozzoli, showing his artistry in depicting the journey to the stable in Bethlehem – figures on horseback having the faces of members of the Medici family. Wonder at the plants and the animals in their keeping. The Uffizi beckons, and therein is all manner of art. Visit Michelangelo’s David in the Accademia. In the many churches of Florence you can see all aspects of art for free and the sculptures in the Piazza della Signoria are a feast. Brenda Walmsley, West Yorkshire Sydney The finest art I have seen is on Bondi Beach, Sydney . Along the length of it is the “The Sea Wall”, which consists of nearly 100 pieces of temporary artwork created by local artists. The Sea Wall, like the sea, is forever changing, with new artists creating murals over previous ones. There are two permanent pieces: these are in memory of Anzacs and the Bali bombing victims. The artwork is beautiful, meaningful, contemporary and engaging. Katie Smith by email Art on Bondi Beach Photo: Getty Venice This has to be the best city in the world for art. It’s brimful to bursting with art in every conceivable corner. There’s the Accademia rich with works by Titian, Canaletto, Caravaggio, Canova and Veronese, among many others. There’s St Mark’s and the Doge’s Palace to take in, and the Grand Canal lined with magnificently painted facades. For modern art lovers, Peggy Guggenheim left her spectacular collection in a tranquil villa to be appreciated by everyone. And then there is the city’s abundance of secret, hidden churches and chapels, each one guardian to wonderful historic works of art. But Venice itself and every street is a living, breathing work of art to be soaked up and enjoyed. Just wander, get lost and breathe in its beauty. Stephen Squires, West Yorkshire Ajanta Caves The finest art I have ever seen was in the beautiful natural time machines of the Ajanta and Ellora Caves in India . Their astounding beauty is mesmerising, giving you a walk back down the evolution of man. Being the basic form of communication, the paintings here are not only about the art but the messages they impart about Buddhism and Jainism. The paintings give one goose bumps about the bygone era and the love these people had for their art. Spoorthi Ramesh, India Ajanta caves in India Photo: Getty Lisbon Lisbon is where I have experienced art in the most immersive way. The city’s art scene is a pleasure to explore, with fine examples of traditional Portuguese art, but also a great contemporary international scene housed in the galleries of Museu Colecao Berardo, Galeria 111 and Trema Arte Contemporanea. Walking around Lisbon, however, there is more to see than just the galleries themselves. The vibrant street art is dotted around the city, from the cruise port to the narrowing stairways in between the traditional houses. There is always something new to see, making repeat visits a pleasure for art lovers. Francesca Sayer-Doyle, Kent Street art in Lisbon Photo: Getty Kalahari Desert Pressed into the soft, pale sand of the Kalahari Desert was a fresh paw print. The first visitor of the day to this art gallery in the wilderness had been a leopard; she had headed up past a lone and magnificent baobab tree in the direction of the paintings. We followed her up the polished sides of the isolated monolith to a gallery of ancient art, painted some 4,000 years ago. Perched on the rock face, we admired the exquisite paintings of elephant, giraffe and antelope framed by the vast open skies of Botswana. Long ago, the San people looked out and painted the splendour of the natural world. This solitary hill, with its art and its wildlife, is still very special. Moments after returning to our vehicle, the female leopard emerged from the rocks, patrolling her territory and flicking her tail as she went.
