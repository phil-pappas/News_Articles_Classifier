In fact, two fortnights ago, I had even mentioned the essence of masterclasses and how they help the men and women in the trade. As a sommelier, it is vital to constantly work on enhancing one’s knowledge. As a sommelier in India, all this is even more important, as customer education and general wine awareness is utterly lacking. So a place that has a dedicated wine server, even if not a sommelier, is a great place to start your tryst with wines. They will not only guide you correctly, but can also engage in lively conversations on the subject, which can be as heady and lasting as the stuff in the bottle itself.\nBut most of us squirm when the sommelier comes to our table. The first thought that gradually begins to fester is that this is nothing, but an elaborate way devised by the hotel to make us part with our money. In many cases, this is sadly true. But in the few cases, where a good sommelier worth his grape knows about wines, the premium one pays for the wines more than compensates for an interaction with him/her.\nSo in order to help you use your sommelier effectively, and not in the way your last girlfriend ‘used’ you and then left you for a life of undetermined celibacy, here are the questions you should have in your repository when you meet a sommelier in order to extract the best of their knowledge and skills:\n* Share what you don’t like: While it helps to tell a sommelier what you enjoy by way of regions and styles, if you could instead tell what you don’t like, it helps the sommelier pick more options out for you. This is how it goes—if you tell me what you like, chances are I will suggest others along the same lines, whereas by having knowledge of what you don’t like, I can introduce you to many a new flavour and style. Your choice.\n* Share what you have tried: This is the your wine CV of sorts. By telling the wine server what you have tried (and whether you liked it or not), you are sharing your experiences. It helps ascertain just how deep you have delved into this endless treasure trove and the sommelier can ensure he takes you to your comfort zone and then nudges you further along just a little bit.\n* Suggest price ranges: This is the most important thing, an exercise in humility. If I had a rupee for every time a person walked in and asked for the ‘best wine’, but then settled for a house wine by the glass when they saw what the big bottles could really set them back by, I would be a rich man. If you don’t wish to say it outright (“I am looking for a bottle in the R3,000 range”), point out wines in a price range not too far from what you are willing to pay; a smart sommelier will catch on. In fact, not fulfilling your role here is what makes a sommelier suggest what appears to be ludicrously-priced options, which then serve to further widen the trust divide.\n* Mention special requests: Birthdays to allergies or just an inexplicable penchant for organic or biodynamic wines, whatever your peeve and no matter how unusual, share it with the sommelier. I am not saying sommeliers are prepared for everything you throw their way, but announcing a curve ball before you pitch it helps them be ready when it comes. And you never know when they throw in a little ‘something special’ just because you both share a vinous perversion.\n* Be honest: If you don’t like what the sommelier serves you, be honest in your critique. Don’t unnecessarily bear down on the chap nor question his knowledge or intent. Instead, constructively try and understand why the suggestion was made and consequently what you can add (next time) in your description to make sure such lapses aren’t repeated.\nIf you can remember these few cardinal rules, you are about to embark on a lovely journey of wines with a good sommelier as your guide. I wish you both bon voyage!\nThe writer is a sommelier\n 25, 2015 12:02 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:25:23.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
