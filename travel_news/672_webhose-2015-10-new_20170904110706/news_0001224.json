Nepalese motorists push their vehicles into a line for fuel at a local gas station, but many had to leave without fuel. (HEMANTA SHRESTHA / EPA) Larry Habegger, Dani Burlison Chicago Tribune Fuel dries up in Nepal during peak trekking season. \nNepal: In the middle of the peak trekking season, beleaguered Nepal is experiencing a nationwide fuel shortage because of blockages at the Indian border arising from an India-connected ethnic group's protest over Nepal's new constitution. Tourists may want to reconsider travel within the country because several security issues could present safety concerns for visitors. Fuel shortages not only affect land transportation but emergency vehicles as well. Many emergency services such as medevacs and hospitals also face a shortage of emergency supplies, which could be disastrous in urgent situations. Many restaurants have shut down because of supply shortages. \nChile: A Belgian tourist suffered severe burns over 75 percent of her body after an attempt to photograph El Tatio geysers, near the northern desert town of San Pedro de Atacama. The 68-year-old woman fell into the geysers, which shoot columns of scalding hot water into the air every morning and was in critical condition at a Santiago hospital. Although the region is known for hot spring pools for soaking in, El Tatio geysers are extremely hot, and tourists should use caution. \nEgypt: A high terrorism threat remains throughout the country, particularly as two phases of parliamentary elections take place. The first phase of elections is Oct. 18-19 in Giza, Fayoum, Beni Suef, Minya, Asyut, New Valley, Sohag, Qena, Luxor, Aswan, Red Sea, Alexandria, Beheira and Matrouh. The second round takes place Nov. 22-23 in Cairo, Qalyubia, Dakahlia, Monufia, Gharbia, Kafr el-Sheikh, Sharqia, Damietta, Port Said, Ismailia, Suez, North Sinai and South Sinai governorates. Tourists traveling in these regions at election time should avoid large crowds and demonstrations and have personal security plans in place. \nGuatemala: Because of ongoing disputes over park management, police and other security personnel do not have access to the Semuc Champey Natural Monument/Lanquin Alta Verapaz National Park. This lack of security prompted the U.S. Embassy to warn tourists against visiting the area until police have regained access. \nTurkey: After nearly 100 people were killed and more than 200 injured in double suicide bombings during a peaceful protest in Ankara, officials urged travelers to use caution while in or near large gatherings, because even well-organized, peaceful demonstrations can be unpredictable. Tourists should have personal security plans and be vigilant about surroundings at all times. \nCompiled from news services and travel sources.
