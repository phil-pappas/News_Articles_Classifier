Last Friday, two Coast Guard officers patrolling Junquillal beach near the town of Flamingo, Santa Cruz caught two poachers with hundreds of Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) sea turtle eggs, according to the Public Security Ministry.\nThe suspects, identified with the surnames Carrera and Gutiérrez, were carrying their loot of 315 lora turtle eggs in several bags when law enforcement found them Friday evening. Coast Guard officers handed both suspects over to the flagrancy court in Flamingo. Commander Rodolfo Coto, director of the Flamingo Coast Guard station, said that the eggs were no longer viable and had to be destroyed, according to a statement from the Security Ministry.\nOlive Ridley turtles are listed as a “vulnerable” species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Egg harvesting, bycatch from industrial fishing and impacts to their habitat are listed as possible reasons for the sea turtles’ downward population trends.\nCoto said that Coast Guard officials have increased their patrols along the beach recently as Olive Ridley turtles come ashore in droves to lay their eggs between September and October along the northwestern coast.\nSee also: Ojochal beach besieged by turtle poachers, biologists say\nContact Zach Dyer at zdyer@ticotimes.net", "external_links": ["http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/11534/0"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:28:46.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
