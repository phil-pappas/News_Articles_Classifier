The 600-acre burn unit is located on Bald Top and Jesse Ridge. The controlled burns are intended to restore the oak woodlands on the area's upper slopes and ridges and improve forage for elk over time.\nThe Cades Cove burn areas total about 300 acres to reduce woody encroachment, help perpetuate native herbaceous species, reduce exotic plant species and maintain the historic landscape.\nTemporary closures of roads and trails may occur.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:50:32.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
