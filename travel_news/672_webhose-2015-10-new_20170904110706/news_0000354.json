She reports directly to Mr. Josef Dolp, who has been promoted to Vice President of Operations for Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Korea.\n \nIn her new role, Ms. McNab oversees all of the hotel operations at the 4,000-room Sheraton Macao Hotel – Starwood’s largest Sheraton worldwide – as well as the 400-room St. Regis Macao set to open in December. Australian-born, but of Italian descent, Ms. McNab began her career with Starwood Hotels & Resorts 25 years ago out of Brisbane. She has spent more than 13 of those years in Asia, working at properties throughout Thailand, China, Indonesia, and now – Macau.\n \n“Throughout her career with Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Janet has led the openings of key hotels and is highly regarded for implementing a number of very successful Sales and Marketing strategies for properties all across Asia,” said Josef Dolp, Vice President of Operations for Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau and Korea. “Her experience in Asia, coupled with her exceptional leadership skills make her perfectly suited to take on the role of Managing Director for both Sheraton Macao Hotel and the soon-to-be-opened St. Regis Macao.\n \nWhen asked about her recent move to Macau, Ms. McNab said: “I look forward to driving the continued success of the world’s largest Sheraton and overseeing the opening of The St. Regis Macao. Managing two internationally renowned brands presents an exciting new challenge, and I am happy to be returning to the Greater China region, where I launched my international career. I love the idea of change and feel fortunate that I can do what I love to do most.”\nPrior to her current assignment, Ms. McNab served dual roles as both Area General Manager, Starwood Hotels & Resorts in South Thailand and General Manager of The Westin Siray Bay Resort & Spa from 2013 to 2015. As Area General Manager, she worked with eight Starwood hotels throughout Thailand to position South Thailand as a key resort destination. While donning her Area General Manager hat, she was also responsible for overseeing the strategic direction of The Westin Siray Bay Resort & Spa.\n \nUpon completing an MBA in Australia and having served as Director of Sales & Marketing at Sheraton Brisbane Hotel & Towers, Ms. McNab embarked on her international career by moving to Nanjing, China in 2002. As Executive Assistant Manager (EAM) of Sales & Marketing at Sheraton Nanjing Kingsley Hotel & Towers, she spearheaded the strategic direction for the property. From 2006 to 2009, she was based in Indonesia, where she was accountable for 22 properties across Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei as Regional Director of Sales & Marketing, South East Asia for Starwood Hotels & Resorts. Between 2008 and 2009, upon completion of the Starwood Careers General Manager development program, she took on the additional role of General Manager for the Le Meridien Nirwana Resort & Spa, Bali. Then in December 2009, she went on to successfully open Four Points by Sheraton Bangkok, where she led the strategic direction and positioning of the first Four Points brand in the Indochina region.\n \nJanet’s appointment closely follows the announcement of Starwood Asia Pacific’s Female Talent Roadmap in March this year, which underscores Starwood’s commitment to gender equality hiring practices. The roadmap comprises of initiatives, programs and trainings aimed to prepare female associates to assume executive positions; ultimately to increase female general manager representation globally. Other initiatives to develop talent include strengthening the success of Starwood Careers, the integrated talent management & development system conceptualized specifically in Asia Pacific to fit the region’s unique fast growing talent needs.\n \nSource:-Starwood Hotels & Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:44:54.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
