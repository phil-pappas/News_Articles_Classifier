The law, long-sought by advocacy groups, is seen as a first step towards allowing gay marriage in the heavily Catholic country.\n“As Chile has changed, and for the better … this was unthinkable a few years ago,” said government spokesman Marcelo Díaz in launching the new promotional campaign, “A Law For All Families.”\nThe new law enables unmarried heterosexual or homosexual couples living under the same roof to co-own property, receive inheritance and pension benefits, and make medical decisions.\nAnd if a child’s biological parent becomes no longer able to care for them, custody decisions will give priority to that parent’s civil union partner, a provision demanded by gay rights organizations.\nAccording to government figures, nearly 1,600 couples have registered so far under the civil union law.\nThe government said a special plan would be in place to register civil unions on Thursday, despite an unrelated strike by civil servants.\nChile was one of the last countries to legalize divorce, in 2004, and does not allow abortion under any circumstances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:55:32.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
