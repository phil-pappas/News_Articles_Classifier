When you do, it's handy to check in online before your flight, so you can save time and effort at the airport. \nLike many major airlines, US Airways allows travelers to check in up to 24 hours before their flights (but not less than 60 minutes prior to flights--after that, you have to check in at the airport). Once you check in online, you can choose your seats and print your boarding pass. Their website also allows you to pay for any checked bags or check for upgrades. \nSimply use the US Airways online check-in webpage to choose seats, check upgrades, or check in online for your next US Airways flight. \nIf you have luggage to check, you'll need to take it to one of US Airways' check-in counters, or find a US Airways skycap at the airport.
