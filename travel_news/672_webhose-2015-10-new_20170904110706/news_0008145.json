Exit Transaero :-( pic.twitter.com/MIPdE2LQme — PJ de Jong (@jong_pj) October 25, 2015 \nEconomy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev had warned earlier this month the airline faced bankruptcy after Aeroflot failed to reach agreement with Transaero’s creditors on a restructure of its estimated 250 billion roubles ($5.2 billion) debt pile. \nAeroflot’s board of directors had in September approved the acquisition of a controlling 75-per cent-plus-one-share stake in Transaero for the symbolic sum of 1 rouble in a government-backed deal But the deal foundered on the debt issue and the carrier, hit by three straight years of heavy losses, filed for bankruptcy on October 1 after the civil aviation authority ordered it to stop selling tickets. \nAfter 25 years in the air its 106-strong fleet, mainly composed of long-haul Boeing jets, will be grounded after the federal air transport agency Rosaviatsia ruled its precarious financial state posed a potential threat to passenger safety. \nPrivately-owned Transaero, which employs some 10,000 staff, started out by leasing Aeroflot aircraft and serving destinations across the former Soviet Union as well as parts of Asia and the Caribbean. \nThe firm’s woes add to a growing exodus of foreign carriers with the likes of EasyJet and Air Berlin as well as Lufthansa announcing pullouts in recent months, citing weak demand as Russia labours under international sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine. It has been grounded now. Picture: Andy Mitchell \nThe Russian market has been further hit by the slump in oil prices which has helped provoke the worst drop in purchasing power in 15 years, while the rouble has also seen its value eroded, forcing up costs of fuel and aircraft leasing. \nTuesday evening saw a flicker of hope with a reported bid for a majority stake in Transaero by Vladislav Filev, CEO of S7, Russia’s number-three carrier. \nHowever, the Russian authorities said the distressed airline had been grounded definitively, with Rosaviatsia director Alexander Neradko telling reporters its operating license had been revoked. \nDeputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov said the airline “will leave the market” but assured that “passengers will not suffer” as other carriers, led by Aeroflot, would take on its 156 routes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:08:00.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
