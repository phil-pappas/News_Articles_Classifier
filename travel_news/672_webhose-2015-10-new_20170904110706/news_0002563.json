This will deliver real benefits to the travelling public and make us an even more appealing hub for global aviation.”\n“The additional aeronautical capital expenditure also means Auckland Airport will be able to meet peak demand this summer with a new international bus lounge facility, as well as additional layover stands for the larger Code E aircraft, such as Airbus’\n350 XWB and Boeing’s B777 and B787-8 Dreamliner.”\n“I am confident that our investment programme means we are catering for our short-term aeronautical capacity, the strong property demand pipeline and aligns with our longer-term plans for the next 30-years and beyond,” says Mr Neutze.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:34:53.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
