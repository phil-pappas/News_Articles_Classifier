Using customized interior and exterior layouts as well as fully custom-built cabinetry the Astondoa 80 GLX can be created to maximize relaxation and entertainment while at sea. The show model features the fine furnishings custom-built by the shipyard, which has long been one of the company's signatures-beyond yachts to the most prestigious homes and estates of Europe .\nOn the main deck, large wrap-around windows bring the outdoors in; while enhancing natural light at the interior port-side helm station, spacious dining and seating areas, the expansive glass also provides excellent water views.\nSpecially whitewashed stained interior flooring complements the neutral color scheme, brightened by use of white and taupe leather throughout. Marble and glass accents in the en suite heads for four staterooms add color and shine while rich textures of wood and fabrics demonstrate the design excellence made possible by the custom build. The fully appointed outdoor spaces cater to water recreation and entertainment, with a sizable swim platform and garage for a tender or many water toys.\nFairline Targa 53 GT\nG Marine introduces a new sleek express cruiser yacht, the Fairline Targa 53 GT , the latest addition from the UK's finest production yacht builder.
