The system trains pilots in a more realistic visual environment than current simulators and allows them to experience extreme maneuvers that typically are only practiced in a simulator.\nThe final CRVS installations were recently done by Boeing and the Air Force at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida. Simulators at Hawaii’s Hickam Air Force Base, Alaska’s Elmendorf Air Force Base and Virginia’s Langley Air Force Base, also have the system.\n“The final installation of the Boeing Constant Resolution Visual System improves the realism of ground-based training and increases mission readiness for pilots,” said Lt. Col. Matthew Zamiska, 325th Training Support Squadron commander. “This is paramount for Tyndall’s mission of training and projecting unrivaled combat airpower.”\nBoeing’s patented CRVS display is the centerpiece of the training suite and provides high-resolution imagery for pilots with nearly 20/20 acuity in an immersive, 360-degree visual environment. By using off-the-shelf projectors, the system takes advantage of the rapidly emerging commercial technology.\n“With innovative thinking, backed by a roadmap for advancing the technology in years ahead, the CRVS is anticipating the future needs of customers,” said Tim Noonan, Boeing’s vice president of Training Systems and Government Services. “We’re providing the customer with a tool that makes them mission ready and also gives them an edge in the sky because of the way pilots can train in this system.”\nCRVS, first delivered in 2010, is found in a variety of other aircraft simulators, including the F-15 Eagle, AH-64 Apache, M-346 Master, BAE Hawk and F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n“Boeing’s CRVS is unique in that, unlike any other visual system, it provides the warfighter with constant target visibility throughout the entire field of vision,” said Scott Whitaker, Boeing’s display team manager. “The CRVS is a great benefit to the customer top-down, because it provides highly effective training at a low cost.”\nA member of the F-22 Raptor team with Lockheed Martin and Pratt &Whitney, Boeing develops, integrates and delivers F-22 aircrew and maintenance training systems to the Air Force, along with logistics and sustainment services.\nSource:- Boeing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:19:44.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
