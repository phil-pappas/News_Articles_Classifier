All were bused back to the terminal and passengers were put on a different plane that later departed Las Vegas. \nFire trucks dousing our plane while the crew tries to tell us there's nothing wrong. Posted by Mike Scott on Sunday, 11 October 2015 \nThe airline said the pilot aborted takeoff and reported the fire as the plane was rolling down the runway after indications of a mechanical issue. The plane taxied to a remote area and was met by firefighters. \nChristine Crews, a McCarran spokeswoman, said 11 firefighters from the Clark County Fire Department put out the fire within 30 seconds of the response. Emergency slides were deployed but passengers used the stairs at the back of the plane to avoid the risk of the slides, such as burns and bruises. \n\"The fire was out,\" Crews said. \"There wasn't imminent threat of harm.\" A video posted by Sonia Castillo (@sonia905) on Oct 11, 2015 at 2:16pm PDT A video posted by Sonia Castillo (@sonia905) on Oct 11, 2015 at 2:23pm PDT \nThe incident did not disrupt the airport's operations and all runways stayed open and functional. \nThe airline said it is conducting an investigation into the cause of the fire. The US National Transportation Safety Board said it is gathering information but has not launched an investigation. \nThe McDonnell Douglas MD-80 plane registered to the carrier was built in 1991 and was most recently certified in March 2011. The engine was made by Pratt & Whitney, according to the FAA. Boeing is the parent company of the MD-80. \nThe fire is the latest in a string of issues for the Vegas-based company in recent months and comes after a British Airways plane caught fire at the airport in September. Ad Feedback \nA British Airways' London-bound plane halted on the runway as it was preparing to take off on September 8 after an engine caught fire. All 157 passengers and 13 crew members survived, some with minor injuries. \nFor Allegiant, a possible maintenance issue was cited in September when a flight from North Dakota, to Las Vegas was diverted to an airport in southern Utah. Another Allegiant flight made an emergency landing in July at a closed airport in Fargo, North Dakota, after company executives piloting the aircraft reported they were nearly out of fuel . In June, flights at St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport in Florida were cancelled after one of its planes was forced to make an emergency landing because of pressurisation problems. \nIn 2013, Allegiant grounded its MD-80s for days to check and service exit chutes after acknowledging it missed a 2007 manufacturer's recommendation to overhaul chutes every year instead of every three years. \nThe airline has also been facing ongoing labour disputes with pilots and flight attendants, with a federal judge this year barring Allegiant pilots from striking. - AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:38:07.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
