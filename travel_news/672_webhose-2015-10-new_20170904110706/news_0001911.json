YOUTUBE/SCREENGRAB \nA woman gave birth to her baby with the help of crew and a fellow passenger on board a China Airlines flight bound for LA. \nThe pilot made the decision to land the plane for the safety of the woman and her child, but 30-minutes before landing, the baby was born. \nA video, taken of the moment the baby arrived, shows airline crew wiping the baby and the mother with tissues. \nSomeone can also be overheard saying: \"This is a once in a lifetime thing. These tourists will never experience this again.\" \nThe China Post has reported that the child's nationality will depend on the birth certificate issued in Alaska, because the baby was born in US airspace. \nThis is the second in-flight birth in a week. \nHeba Majdy gave birth to her daughter, Nancy, on board an Jazeera Airways flight. \nAccording to the Daily News Egypt, the airline has since offered baby Nancy free flights until she turns 18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:52:14.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
