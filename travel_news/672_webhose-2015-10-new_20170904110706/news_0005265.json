Our reputation cannot rely on luck,\" Slater told the NZ Herald .\n\"The cable failure is not only extremely concerning, it leaves New Zealand vulnerable to harmful tourism reaction. This must be sorted immediately.\"\nNew cable strops will be installed on the bridge in coming weeks.\nThe bridge will be recommissioned after being tested.\nLocated on the country's North Island, Te Urewera National Park is known for its rugged mountains, lakes, forests and secluded hiking trails.", "external_links": ["http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11507974"], "published": "2015-10-10T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:04:40.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
