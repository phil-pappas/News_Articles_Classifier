Bee Rowlatt followed her trail to Norway There is just no escaping the tragedy at the heart of the Wollstonecraft story Photo: GETTY By Bee Rowlatt Comments \nI t all began with a love story. In 1796 a daredevil Enlightenment writer published a peculiar travel book called Letters from Norway. Mary Wollstonecraft’s cocktail of dry local statistics and devastating heartbreak was a bestselling smash hit, and it sent the Romantics into a swoon. The philosopher William Godwin wrote, “If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book.” \nIt had the same effect on me. The clincher was the real motive behind this Scandinavian trip of hers: although she never actually mentions it, Wollstonecraft was on a treasure hunt. She wasn’t just roaming about holding forth on the smell of herrings and the price of coffee. No – she was chasing a missing cargo of silver, and possibly getting entangled in illegal smuggling operations. Wollstonecraft inspired a generation of Romantic writers and called for women’s rights more than a century before the suffragettes \nBy now I was determined to find out how she did it. How on earth did she pull off a writing gig while chasing a villainous Norwegian captain around the treacherous waters of the Skagerrak ? With a baby in tow? In 1795? I was bending the ear of a certain travel editor with these questions when he sighed. “Well go on then.”“What?”“Do it! Follow her. And get me 1,200 words for Telegraph Travel.” And so I did . \nTravel is all about imagining other possible lives, and in this case we tried to get right inside another’s life. But these were not easy footsteps to retrace. Mary Wollstonecraft was the founder of feminism, author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and the first female war correspondent. She inspired a generation of Romantic writers (her daughter wrote Frankenstein) and called for women’s rights more than a century before the suffragettes. But on this trip, she was heartbroken, and depressed. The truth is, she was trying to locate her two-timing boyfriend’s stolen shipment of silver, in an attempt to regain his affections. \nBee in Norway \nJust like Wollstonecraft, I took my baby along on the trip to Norway. But a flight, a drive, a ferry and a train ride later, my monstrous rucksack was proving even more vexatious than the tired baby. As we struggled up the last hill towards the hostel in the southern coastal town of Tonsberg, I was having serious doubts about the sanity of this undertaking. The next day, however, bolstered by a Norwegian breakfast of sweet fish and brown cheese, everything began to make sense. \nWe found out the precise locations, the places where Wollstonecraft poured her heart into the poignant letters. A baby in a buggy with a woman reading aloud under an umbrella in the rain may not be your traditional seance. But I felt we were invoking her spirit, reading her words in the very place they were conceived. “Nothing can equal the beauty of the northern summer’s evening and night,” she wrote. Watching “orient beams… varying into purple”, she’s “almost afraid to breathe, lest I should break the charm”. The life of Mary Wollstonecraft 1759 Born in London’s Spitalfields into an unhappy, violent family. 1778 Becomes a lady’s companion in Bath. 1784 Moves with her sisters to London; they set up a school. 1785 Travels to Portugal to support her best friend, who then dies in childbirth. 1786 Returns to London to find the school has failed. Writes first book: Thoughts on the Education of Daughters. 1786 Works as a governess for the richest family in Ireland until she gets fired. 1788 Begins publishing books and reviews. 1790 Edmund Burke writes Reflections on the Revolution in France. Wollstonecraft’s response, A Vindication of the Rights of Men, launches her career in earnest. 1792 A Vindication of the Rights of Woman published to acclaim. Wollstonecraft travels alone to live in Paris. 1793 Wollstonecraft falls in love with Gilbert Imlay and gets pregnant. 1794 Has a baby, but is abandoned by Imlay. 1795 Following suicide attempt, she takes the baby on the Scandinavian voyage. 1796 Returns to London. Publishes Letters from Norway. Meets William Godwin. 1797 Marries Godwin, dies giving birth to Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein. \nTonsberg was still as beautiful, as peaceful as she described. And to our great fortune the baby and I managed to wangle a sea voyage with local Wollstonecraft detective Gunnar Molden. Gunnar joined us on maritime capers that took us from the island town of Kragero via the magical “little haven” of Portor, along the terrifying intricacies of the Norwegian coastline to our final destination: Risor. \nWith a twinge of disloyalty (Wollstonecraft loathed it here), Risor became my new favourite place. It is an unusual balance of wildness and civilisation. White wooden houses against soaring rocks. Rows of bobbing multicoloured fishing boats. And islands upon islands, never-ending folds of land in and out of water. It’s a heavenly spot. Just don’t assume that you can afford a glass of wine with your dinner. \nTravelling mother and baby combos may be a more common sight today than in the 1790s. Even so, we were odd enough to pique people’s curiosity, and generosity. Wollstonecraft met similar treatment: “They approached to assist me… and wished to protect me. The sympathy I inspired, thus dropping down from the clouds in a strange land, affected me…” The proximity to my hero, the locals’ kindness, and the soaring wilderness of our surroundings all combined to put me in a state of euphoria. I became addicted to the chase, and even after finishing my article, I was unable to stop writing. Like Wollstonecraft’s ill-fated hunt for the missing silver, I had embarked on my own treasure trail. \nThat article for the Telegraph grew into a full-blown biographical experiment that was to consume the next four years of my life. My fascination with the hundred-mile-an-hour life of Mary Wollstonecraft and her “unvanquishable greatness of soul” developed into a severe case of wanderlust. \nBack in Wollstonecraft’s day there was only one destination for a tousled radical with dreams of a perfectible society. Paris: the epicentre of the biggest earthquake to hit Western civilisation. She galloped off right into the thick of it. How could she know that her gleaming Enlightenment idealism was soon to become mired in blood? We, too, came up against obstacles in Paris, albeit not quite as uncompromising as the guillotine. To put it politely, it’s not the most baby-friendly of cities. But then, researching the French Revolution is not the most baby-friendly pastime. The hapless child became my own mini-Reign of Terror, particularly in the Revolution Rooms at the Musée Carnavalet, where only a skimpy rope shields such priceless artefacts as the King Louis XVI chair on which the queen awaited the guillotine. No, that was not our finest hour. \nFrom here we set off beyond her lifetime, headlong into the outermost horizons of her legacy. Wollstonecraft herself never made it to America but it was her dearest wish to go there, and she was even quoted by the then president of the United States. This is why the baby and I set our sights on the place that Wollstonecraft looked to when hope fled the streets of Paris. America was her future: a crucible of radical ideas and youthful uprisings. We went, of course, to San Francisco, where Wollstonecraft’s call for gender equality took us in some unexpected directions. I certainly never thought my treasure trail would end in a fizzy pool in California being cradled by a naked hippy with giant breasts. \nOur travels through the prism of her life, her work, and her death, were bigger and very much brighter than I could have dreamt. After all, who can resist the huge beaches, monumental trees and even bigger wines of the bountiful Golden State? But it wasn’t all sunbeams. Along the way we encountered the murkier underbelly of the Romantic movement and its bad-boy radicals. I came uncomfortably close up to my own hippy-phobia. And above all, there is just no escaping the tragedy at the heart of the Wollstonecraft story. Her death in childbirth was closely followed by the complete annihilation of her reputation, at the hands of the man who loved her most \nThere’s a reason she isn’t as well known as she should be. Most people can’t even spell her name, let alone emblazon it. And this is why: her death in childbirth was closely followed by the complete annihilation of her reputation, at the hands of the man who loved her most. Wollstonecraft’s husband, William Godwin, unwittingly unleashed a storm by writing a biography that revealed her unusual life and loves, and her attempted suicides. Wollstonecraft’s writing and achievements were trampled to oblivion in the backlash. \nBut for me, more than two centuries later, she was inspirational, and following her footsteps was a remarkable way to travel the world. Often her company was maddening, sad and frustrating, but it gave our encounters new depth and texture. If your journey has an unusual purpose it can open people up to you. Everyday encounters can take extraordinary turns – it’s a backstage pass behind the usual tourist veneer. What is already an immersive act became much more so – and adding our experiences on top of hers, and seeing the world through her eyes, complete with all her heartbreak, humour and indignation, was undoubtedly the most enriching travel experience I have had. \nWant more?
