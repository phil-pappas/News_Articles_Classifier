DFW has already succeeded in attracting airline service to 57 international destinations, with 17 of those arriving in just the past five years.\n\"To build the airport of the future, we must start to think strategically how and where to expand our operations,\" said Donohue. \"We already know that much of our future growth will come from international travel.\"\n\" DFW Airport has played a major role in the ongoing economic success, of the Dallas Fort Worth region,\" said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings . \"Our region's growth rate far outpaces the U.S. average population growth since 2011, and we are continuing to see new businesses expand here.\"\n\"While we have seen a tremendous expansion of international flights at DFW, we see a great opportunity as a region to win even more on the global stage,\" said Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price . \"The ability to connect the DFW area to international commerce and tourism will keep our region strong and growing.\"\n\" DFW Airport is our gateway to the world,\" said Airport Board Chair Lillie Biggins . \"It makes our world just a little bit smaller and allows us to learn and appreciate new cultures and traditions, to expand new horizons, and to embark on a journey that will leave an impression on us forever.\"\nDonohue said the new DFW brand unveiled two weeks ago will serve as a central component in communicating DFW's story to the world more frequently and more richly. Over the last five years DFW has conducted about a dozen air service development missions to promote new air service and support existing service to places including China , South America , the Middle East and Australia .\n\"Working together, we can build on our success, we can continue to expand the North Texas economy, achieve new goals and reach new heights around the country and around the world,\" said Donohue.\nThe Airport CEO also reported that DFW has become the first U.S. airport to achieve a Level Three certification under the Airport Carbon Accreditation program for successfully reducing carbon emissions and engaging local partners to do the same.\n\"This certifies our leadership as an airport that takes care of the environment even as we take care of business,\" said Donohue.\nDonohue also revealed that the United States Patent Office today has issued DFW Airport its first ever patent for the development of \"interactive information display\" technology that allows customers to use touch screens to find their way to restaurants, shops and services in the terminals.\nAs a key factor in improving the experience for DFW customers, Donohue referenced the ongoing $2.7 billion dollar Terminal Renewal and Improvement Program (TRIP) project to renew DFW's four original terminals, now more than halfway complete, along with the addition of compelling amenities such as the new duty-free shopping facilities scheduled to open in Terminal D next year.\nAbout Dallas Fort Worth International Airport:\nDallas Fort Worth International ( DFW) Airport warmly welcomes more than 63 million customers along their journey every year, elevating DFW to a status as one of the most frequently visited superhub airports in the world.
