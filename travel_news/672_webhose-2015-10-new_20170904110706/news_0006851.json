It's also a hassle because most grocery stores sell it in a quantity that pretty much outlasts any short-term trips. (Most of the time, oil is an easy sub for cooking anyways. But it sure is nice to have buttered toast...) \nThe only reasonable solution is to steal small butter packets from a diner (difficult) or bring along 4-ounce sticks of butter (easier). Butter is actually fairly easy to transport--I've done it hundreds of times but mostly to bring specialty butter back--by freezing it for a few days and then throwing it in a suitcase at the last minute. Barring 36-hour trips that include a Doha stopover , it's usually fine. Spices A good spice rack is the spice of life. Salt and pepper are the basics but it's not hard to dole up a custom spice rack for not much money or hassle. \nOne of the most popular methods to bring spices along a trip is by repurposing Tic Tac boxes into a portable spice rack for the road. This is not recommended because Tic Tac boxes aren't airtight or spill-proof. I have to agree with Gabriel Harding and Jade Adele from the We Travel and Blog here: it is definitely not fun cleaning garam masala or curry powder out from clothes. For that reason, I'm a bigger fan of stackable pill-looking boxes. (I'd also chunk it in a Ziploc bag for good measure.) There's a whole range of count and sizes out there, depending on what's needed. \nThe Mobile Foodie Survival Kit essentially uses the same method to transport spices. The price is a bit high but it does come with spices and a container to protect the spices that's better than most DIY solutions. That almost makes it worth the cost to prevent it from spilling everywhere or going stale. Coffee I used to make fun of Lowell Heddings at How-To Geek back in the day for buying a French press to feed his coffee addiction on the road. I'm going to eat my words now.\nCoffee is the only way to function. For those who 1) don't have access to coffee or 2) can't stand shitty hotel coffee, this can be a serious issue. While French presses seem like an ideal solution, it's a tough sell if they are made of glass. Ideally, it should be made of more resilient materials such as plastic. The AeroPress, in particular, has been touted for being especially portable. (Quick note: I've got no particular experience with it.) \nIn terms of coffee grounds , I have a Weck tulip jelly jar I once swiped from a hipster caf√© in San Francisco and is the perfect size for holding enough grounds for about a week, depending on how many cups I go through. (Storing coffee grounds in a mason jar can incur the wrath of TSA police. Mostly because they get mistaken as candles.) If I'm going somewhere like Vietnam or Colombia, I'll often forego my own grounds. The local stuff, plz. \nBut seriously, it depends on how much of a true coffee fiend you are. It's possible to go crazy and bring a personal grinder but each to his own. Even I'll forego bringing the French press most of the time and just bring fresh grounds. At least half of the time, most lodging places are well-equipped to make coffee. I can't stand those Keuring things, though.
