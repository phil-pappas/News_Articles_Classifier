Encouraging more girls to pursue a tech-related career, the competition offers the chance to win up to £9,000 towards the first year of university tuition fees.\nThe Could IT Be You? competition, was set up in 2013 by Network Rail’s chief information officer, Susan Cooklin, after she raised concerns about the slide in the number of women entering the UK’s IT sector\nAccording to the employer body e-skills UK, the number of women working in the IT industry in Britain is falling dramatically. In the 1980s it was as high as 38% but by 2013 has fallen to just 16%. Every year the IT and telecoms professional workforce requires more than 22,500 new entrants directly from education, but at present, only 13% of students on IT-related degrees in the UK are female.\nLaunching the 2015 competition, Susan Cooklin said: “Popular culture has helped create a perception among young women that a career in IT is all about writing code in basement offices – the reality couldn’t be further from the truth. Technology plays a crucial role in all our lives and is absolutely vital to Network Rail as we carry out our Railway Upgrade Plan. This competition is a fantastic way for young women to learn about the great opportunities that a career in IT can offer.”\nShe added: “It seems right that we should launch our competition on Ada Lovelace Day, a celebration of the 19 th century mathematician considered to be the first computer programmer. Women make up half of the UK population yet only 16% of the IT industry. Our own research revealed that two-thirds of young women had not even considered a career in IT. This is a real missed opportunity for many of those women and for British business, which is missing out on a huge amount of talent. We must all do more to reverse this trend.”\nThe Could IT Be You? competition is open to girls aged 16-18 and asks them to explain how technology can improve their lives and make things better. As well as £9,000 towards university tuition fees, the winner and four runners up, receive paid work experience and a year’s coaching and mentoring with Network Rail’s IT team.\nZoe Moore, from Towcester in Northamptonshire, won the inaugural Could IT Be You? competition in 2013 and has just begun her studies in Politics and Economics at the University of Nottingham. She said: “The work experience and mentoring that were offered as part of the prize were fantastic. I’ve been inspired by the people I met and by the experience of seeing just how important technology is to keeping the railway running and making it better. This competition opened my eyes to the great opportunities that can be had with a career in IT.”\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:10:28.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
