This delegation reflects AJC's leadership at the forefront of organizations working to strengthen ties with the Latino community, and marks PI's 26th delegation of influential U.S. Latino leaders to Israel . The program was developed in coordination with Dr. Gabriel Salguero , President of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition (NaLEC), and Rabbi Noam Marans , AJC Director of Interreligious and Intergroup Relations, both of whom are participating in the delegation. \"Latino Evangelicals are a growing force within the American mosaic. This is an historic opportunity to introduce their key leaders to the diverse, historic and innovative society of Israel ,\" said Marans. With a population of 50.5 million, Latinos are one of the fastest growing minorities in the U.S., with projections pointing to an increase to 91 million by 2050. While Latinos are predominantly Catholic, the Pew Research Center's 2013 National Survey of Latinos and Religion found that 16 percent of Latinos identify as Evangelical. As the U.S. gears up for national elections, Latino Evangelicals are organizing into a powerful political force. Unlike their Catholic counterparts, Latino Evangelicals share interests with both major American political parties, positioning them as a key voter demographic in 2016. As senior leaders representing this emerging majority, the Project Interchange participants are powerful voices for their communities. \"The National Latino Evangelical Coalition, and the close to eight million Hispanic evangelicals we represent, are a major spiritual, moral, and political force deeply interested in peaceful inter-cultural and inter-religious relationships in the world,\" said Salguero. NaLEC is proud to partner with AJC and Project Interchange on this first-of-a-kind delegation to learn more about the culture, government, and peoples of the Holy Land.\" 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:26:14.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
