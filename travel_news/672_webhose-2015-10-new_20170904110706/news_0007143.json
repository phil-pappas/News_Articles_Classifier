The event was a unique occasion to reinforce the partnership between UNWTO and the Japanese Travel Association (JATA) through the launch of the Japan Tourism Award for Responsible Tourism in collaboration with UNWTO.\nThe Awards were created in the framework of the partnership between UNWTO and JATA signed in 2013 and aim to promote the principles and implementation of the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism among Japanese government authorities, the tourism industry and local communities.\nIn parallel, UNWTO and JATA organized the International Tourism Forum on ”Tourism and Culture,” with the presence of the Chair of the World Committee on Tourism Ethics, Pascal Lamy.\n“Culture is of immeasurable value to host communities, while tourism can be a considerable force for the promotion and safeguarding of tangible and intangible heritage” said Mr Lamy. “Tourism also represents a vital force for peace, as is stated in the UNWTO Global Code of Ethics for Tourism,” he added.\nThe link between culture and economic development was also underlined by UNWTO Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Xu Jing, who offered to the audience examples of opportunities for stronger cooperation between the two fields, one of the priorities of action of UNWTO work.\nUnder the theme “Move. See. Feel” the second edition of the JATA Tourism Expo offered an overview of the current trends in world tourism with a focus on the Japanese market. With more than 1,600 exhibition booths, and nearly 200,000 visitors the JATA Tourism EXPO 2015 included the International Tourism Forum, the Travel Showcase, and Japan Night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:57:48.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
