Guests can also savor wines from the vast and varied growing regions of the country. Chile's geographic barriers – the Atacama Desert to the north, the Andes Mountains to the east, the Patagonian ice fields to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west – protect its grape-growing valleys from adverse conditions making it a paradise for sustainable winemaking.\n\"While visiting Chile , our team discovered rustic flavors, warm and welcoming people, a compelling landscape and some of the best wines in the world,\" said David Morgan , vice president of food & beverage of Omni Hotels & Resorts. \"We have captured the unique climates and incredibly diverse terroir that our chefs and culinary team experienced through a cultural immersion in this beautiful country. By partnering with the stellar organizations of Wines of Chile , Chile Oliva, ProChile and Fundacion Imagen, and experiencing the culture first-hand, we can truly serve our guests a taste of authentic Chilean flavors.\"\nIn June, Omni chefs traveled to the San Antonio campus of the Culinary Institute of America for a three-day immersive training in Chilean cuisine and cooking techniques with Chilean Chef Rocio Alvarado Diaz ., while Wines of Chile complemented the curriculum with wine training and an exploration of varietal pairings. Thirty Omni food and beverage directors, representing properties from across the U.S., then traveled to Chile for a week in September to taste wines in multiple regions and engage with winemakers for a comprehensive in situ wine education.\n\"We are honored that Omni chose Chile for the 2015 Flavors of the World program,\" said Marybeth Bentwood, executive director of Wines of Chile USA . \"Consumers discover new wines, cocktails and cuisines through restaurants and bars. There is not a more exciting and emerging culinary destination than Chile , and there is not a better partner than Omni Hotels & Resorts to introduce it to food, wine and cocktail aficionados in the US. We are thrilled to be joined by Chile Oliva, a consortium of Chile's finest olive oil producers, Pisco Capel, one of Chile's best pisco producers, as well as Fundacion Imagen and ProChile, two organization dedicated to promoting Chile .\"\nOmni guests will discover Chilean dishes such as Milcaos con Pebre de Palta (fried potato cakes with avocado, banana peppers, tomato, Chilean sea salt); Costillar con Pure Picante (pork ribs slowly cooked in beer and palm honey with potato puree, smoked Chilean chili pepper); and Bacalao con Tomatica n (seared sea bass with braised tomato, yellow corn, cilantro salad).

To complement the menu, premium Chilean olive oil will be available at every table.\nThroughout the promotion, each participating hotel will feature eight to 11 hand-selected Chilean wines in its bars and restaurants. Wine selections consist of favorites such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, Syrah, Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, and Riesling; and new discoveries like Carmenere. Wines are available by the bottle and in 6- or 9-ounce pours.
