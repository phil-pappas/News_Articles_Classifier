In honor of the occasion, it released a time-lapse video taken at Boeing's Everett factory in Washington state that offers a behind-the-scenes look at how the aircraft was assembled. British Airways says its new 787-9 will start flying to Delhi this month. Routes to Abu Dhabi, Muscat, Kuala Lumpur and Austin will follow. A larger incarnation of the 787-8, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is 206 feet long -- 20 feet longer than its predecessor -- and holds 290 passengers. It has a flight range of 8,200 nautical miles. Composite materials make up 50% of the primary structure, including the fuselage and wings, making it 20% more fuel efficient than traditional commercial jets made with aluminum. The first 787-9 rolled off the assembly line in Everett in 2013 and was delivered to its first customer, New Zealand Airlines, last year. The next Dreamliner, the 787-10, is expected to begin commercial service in 2018. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Aviation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:47:24.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
