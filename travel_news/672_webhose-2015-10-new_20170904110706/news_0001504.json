Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Oct 16, 2015 eTN   \nIn a U-turn true to its ilk, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) denies that Fastjet PLC was issued an air service license, contrary to an announcement make last week by the airline under rules of disclosure set by the London Stock Exchange, where the company is quoted. \nThe notoriety of the Kenyan regulators precedes the organization which also stood in the way of RwandAir taking up fifth freedom rights from Entebbe to Nairobi, understanding itself as the Great Aviation Wall of sorts while trampling on protocols and agreements in place through the East African Community (EAC). While eventually yielding after being slapped on the wrist by a Head of State directive, they then still tried to cap the capacity for these flights, again showing themselves as preventers of aviation instead of promoters of aviation. \nWhile Fastjet (PLC) has yet to comment on the utterances of the KCAA, regular aviation sources were swift to claim that such shenanigans are the kicks of a dying horse, with one suggesting that the entire KCAA policy approach was a house of cards due to collapse anytime soon, especially when the bilateral talks with Tanzania take place next month. \n“Frankly, me, I think that one of the two is lying, and it is not Fastjet,” let a regular Kenyan commentator fly before adding, “These guys in London would not dare to breach LSE rules, but our chaps here have no such limitations to deny or tell you lies. They are a discredit to Kenya; just look how they treated Qatar Airways ahead of the Kilimanjaro launch and how they continue to block them from Mombasa. This entire organization needs to have their brains reloaded with a modern-day version of how aviation is supposed to work,” - clearly harsh words but by the look of it well deserved. Efforts are being made to obtain comments from Fastjet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:15:50.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
