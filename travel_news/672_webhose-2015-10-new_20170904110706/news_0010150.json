Gingery Lebkuchen or torrone? Santa or St Nick? All across Europe, the season of Christmas markets is approaching. Large and small, they promise conviviality, special food, drink, music and more. Best of all, each reflects the culture of the region. So, choose a market for your mood and head off for a jolly weekend break. \nInnsbruck city centre is beautifully decorated for the festive season (AP) Photo: AP Austria Innsbruck November 15–January 6 \nGemütlichkeit (think warm glow; cosy fires) – and plenty of it – is on offer in this small city surrounded by mountains. Of the half-a-dozen markets, the most romantic is in the Altstadt, lined with medieval houses. Stalls are piled with gingerbread, wooden toys and delicate ornaments, made of handblown glass. At dusk, trumpeters play carols on the 500-year-old Golden Roof. Try the Kiachln, Advent doughnuts, served hot, with cranberry sauce. On the narrow Kiebachgasse, fairy-tale characters, such as Rapunzel peer down from the windows. At weekends, ride the funicular up Nordkette mountain to Hungerburg. After tasty treats at this little market, ride to the top of the Hafelekar for views of twinkling city lights and snow-tipped peaks. Angers November 28 – December 27 \nIn France , good food is a passion and the Soleils d’Hiver (Winter Suns) festival in Angers is a gourmet’s delight. The Place du Ralliement, in front of the theatre, offers a cornucopia of delicious things to eat, not just from the Loire Valley, but all over France. Sip vin chaud (hot mulled wine); nibble on nougat; lick pommes d’amour, much more romantic-sounding than toffee apples, non? But there is more: children ride the carousel and little train; grown-ups look for perfect gifts in chic boutiques on nearby lanes. And over by the 13th-century fortress is the Maison des Vins co-op, where bubbly costs about a fiver a bottle. As Angers is handy for the Channel ports, take the car and load up for Noël. \nStrasbourg specialises in olde worlde charm, but really comes alive at Christmas Photo: AP Strasbourg November 27 – December 31 \nYear round, Strasbourg scores for Olde Worlde charm, but during Advent, the capital of Alsace is even more magical. Half-timbered houses sport giant red-and-white hearts; stars, angels and snowflakes garland the cobbled streets. No wonder Strasbourg has won the title of “Best Christmas Market in Europe” two years running. But locals have plenty of practice in throwing a Yuletide party – the Christkindelsmärik dates back to 1570 and even the towering fir tree on the Place Kléber is a 400-year-old custom. Check out the 11 different “villages” but do not miss the “bredele”. These special biscuits come in all shapes and flavours, from hazelnut, orange and cinnamon to walnut, coconut and praline. Take them home. Hang them on your tree. Then eat them. Hamburg November 23 – January 6 \nFor sheer diversity, Hamburg is hard to beat. In this historic port, 15 different markets cater to all tastes. Traditionalists head for the square in front of the grandiose city hall, where the rows of stalls are themed, from sweet treats (cakes, chocolates and more) to crafts (leather, silver, tree ornaments). Children are entranced by the Spielzeuggasse, the Toy Street, full of playthings from around the world. Romantics opt for the Jungfernstieg market, whose focus is on posh food and gifts; crowd-avoiders choose the smaller Fleetinsel market by the water, where fairy lights twinkle on two antique sailing vessels. Strictly for over-18s is the risqué Santa Pauli market on the X-rated Reeperbahn. \nFood stalls in Hamburg (Photo: Getty) Photo: GETTY Stuttgart November 25-December 23 \nDating back to 1692, the Stuttgarter Weihnachtsmarkt is one of Germany’s best-known pre-Christmas jamborees. In the car-free, old heart of this compact city, the air is scented with spiced wine and boughs of fresh pine. From the Schlossplatz to the Marktplatz, some 300 stalls snake along the cobbled streets; decked out with bright ornaments and sparkling lights, they compete for the coveted title of “best decorated”. Look out for handmade Black Forest specialities, such as felted slippers and real horsehair brushes, knitted hats and artisanal fruit brandies. While the fair is on, first-class – and free – concerts are held in the Renaissance courtyard of the Old Palace and also on the steps of the Town Hall. \nAttractive lanterns are some of the many items for sale at Stuttgart's markets (AP) Worms November 24–December 23 \nAn hour south of Frankfurt and claiming to be “Germany’s oldest city”, Worms proves that small really is beautiful. The action is on and around the market square, where strings of lights fan out above the 50 stalls. Ice skaters show off their skills on the temporary rink, while children pet the real animals in the “living manger”– and clamour to see Santa. His sacks of toys are like a village fête lucky dip: pay €3 (£2.20) and see what you get. With its Roman history and enormous Romanesque cathedral, the past is an everyday presence, but at Christmas, this Rhine-side city springs some surprises. As well classical music and traditional Turmblasen, brass players, there are gospel choirs and even a carol-singing flash mob.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:12:19.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
