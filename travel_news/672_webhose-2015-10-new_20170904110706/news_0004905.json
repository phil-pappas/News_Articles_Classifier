Ash dieback was first discovered in the UK in 2012. It is caused by a fungus, and ash trees suffer loss, lesions on the bark and dieback of the crown of the tree. Trees cannot recover from the infection, but older, larger trees can survive for much longer. Ash dieback is spread by spores, which can disperse naturally via wind over tens of kilometres, making it highly contagious and a major threat to ash populations. There are 130,000 hectares of ash woodland at risk in the UK, and 12 million ash trees outside of woods in parklands, gardens and hedgerows. Symptoms • Dark lesions – often long, thin and diamond-shaped – appear on the trunk at the base of dead side shoots • The tips of shoots become black and shrivelled • Blackened, dead leaves, which may look like frost damage • The veins and stalks of leaves, normally pale in colour, turn brown • Saplings have dead tops and side shoots • In mature trees, there is dieback of twigs and branches in the crown, often with bushy growth further down the branches where new shoots have been produced • In late summer and early autumn (July to October), small white fruiting bodies can be found on blackened leaf stalks Dutch elm disease English elm once dominated the British landscape, but it has been ravaged by Dutch elm disease over the past century. The disease is spread by elm bark beetles. In just two major outbreaks, an estimated 25 million British elm trees were killed. Now it is only occasionally found in hedgerows or woodland. Although labelled “Dutch”, the disease is believed to have originated in Asia, but was first identified in the Netherlands in the Twenties. No cure has been found and it is vital that new cases are reported so that the disease can continue to be tracked. Symptoms • First appears in early summer when clusters of leaves turn yellow and wilt • Leaves then turn brown and fall • Affected shoots die back from the tip • Twigs sometimes turn down to form “shepherd’s crooks” • Twigs have dark streaks in the outer wood beneath the bark, or spots or rings in cross sections Acute oak decline Acute oak decline is thought to have been affecting our native oak species for up to 30 years. It affects mature English and sessile oak trees of at least 50 years in age, but has also been spotted in younger trees with a diameter of 10-12cm. The cause of the disease is thought to be bacterial, but the wood-boring buprestid beetle may be partly to blame. It is most common in the Midlands and the South East. Most affected trees die within four to five years of developing symptoms, while it appears others are capable of recovering from the disease. Several thousand oaks have died since acute oak decline was first spotted. Symptoms • Black weeping patches on stems and trunks • Longitudinal splits in the bark at the site of the bleeds • Lesions and dead tissue under the bleed points • Larvae can weave a path between the inner wood and outer bark • Canopy health seems fine in early stages but grows visibly thinner as trees approach death Phytopthora ramorum Phytophthora ramorum is not just notable for its ability to kill healthy trees, it can mutate to infect other species, and is having a major impact on commercial forestry. Photo: © Fera The disease was first identified in the Nineties and, although it initially affected oaks, it has also been reported to affect Japanese larch trees, Douglas fir, sweet chestnut and beech. It also affects ground-cover plants and shrubs such as bilberry and rhododendron. Few trees in the UK were affected until 2009, when the disease was found to be infecting and killing large numbers of Japanese larch trees in south west England. Then, in 2010, it was found on Japanese larches in Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In 2011 it was found in western Scotland. Symptoms • Signs of black “bleeding” which can dry to a crust on the trunk • The inner bark under this bleeding area is usually discoloured and dying • Trees die when the lesions become extensive on the main trunk • Infection by Japanese larch can take two forms • Shoots and foliage can be affected, visible as wilted, withered shoot tips with blackened needles. The infected shoots shed their needles prematurely • Trees with branch dieback can have numerous resinous cankers on the branches and upper trunk Oak processionary moth The hairs found on this moth and caterpillar contain a toxin which causes irritation to human skin and can induce asthma. It is found in oak forests in Europe and is notable for its impact on human health. The eggs arrived on an oak imported to London in 2006 and the population has been steadily growing in London and Berkshire, despite many attempts to tackle it. The moth is typically not fatal to trees itself but can weaken oaks, making them susceptible to other infections. The caterpillar is known to eat large quantities of leaves, severely reducing the foliage. Climate change may help the moth survive in more parts of Great Britain as milder weather and reduced late frosts could enable the moth to breed further north. Identification • The caterpillars are recognised by their distinctive habit of moving about in late spring and early summer in nose-to-tail processions (from which they derive their name) • They build distinctive white, silken webbing nests on the trunks and branches of oak trees (never among the leaves), and leave white, silken trails on the trunks and branches in early summer • The adult moth is an undistinctive brown moth very similar in appearance to other harmless species • They are active from mid to late summer, and lay their eggs on the smaller twigs and branches of oak trees Dothistroma needle blight Dothistroma needle blight, also known as red band needle blight, because of the colourful symptoms it shows on pine, causes premature needle defoliation in conifers, resulting in loss of yield and, in severe cases, tree death. The disease was mainly limited to the southern hemisphere until the Nineties when it started to take hold in Europe. The Corsican pine is particularly susceptible, but it is also now known that Dothistroma can affect the Scots pine – Britain’s only native pine tree. Symptoms • The first symptoms are visible on infected needles from September • Generally, older needles are affected and typically develop yellow and tan-coloured spots and bands, which rapidly turn red • Needle symptoms are most apparent in June to July. After this, the infected needles are shed and trees may have a typical “lion’s tail” appearance, with only a tuft of the current year’s needles remaining at the branch ends Phytophthora austrocedri Juniper trees are most affected by this disease and it is estimated that just 400 hectares of juniper woodland remain in the UK – mostly in Scotland. Despite its low numbers, the juniper is important in the UK because it plays a vital role in supporting a specialised group of insects, fungi and lichens, as well as birds such as the goldcrest, and provides winter cover for black grouse. The presence of the disease was confirmed at the Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve (the largest area of native juniper woodland in England) in the North Pennines in 2011. It can affect other trees and has been found in Lawson cypress and Nootka cypress trees at two sites in Scotland, and has since been confirmed in Cumbria, Perthshire, and Devon. Symptoms • The foliage of infected trees turns bronze/brown over all or part of the crown • It also occasionally attacks the stem or branches, so that the foliage associated with that particular infected branch or stem turns bronze/brown • When the outer bark of the tree is cut away at the infected area, discoloured inner bark is revealed. The diseased tissue is usually a tan brown colour, often with a distinct yellow coloration at the lesion edges (healthy phloem is white) You may also be interested in: • What is being done to combat tree disease? • How tree disease affects wildlife • The impact of tree disease on British woods", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:21:29.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
