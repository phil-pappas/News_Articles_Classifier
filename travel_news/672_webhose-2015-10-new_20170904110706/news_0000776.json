Many say the hotel is haunted in real life as well, with guests and staff reporting spooky occurrences often. Invisible parties in the ballroom, piano music without a player and curious ghosts standing in rooms are just a few of the paranormal occurrences at this spooky hotel.

The story goes that the Earl of Moray was determined to put an end to the ghostly tales of this tower and hired the biggest, baddest man in the village to stay for a night. The next morning, the hired help was discovered, dead, thrown from a window and with a look of fear frozen on his face. The haunting continues to this day. ( Wikipedia/Dave Conner ) \nHotel del Coronado, San Diego: The Hotel del Coronado was opened more than 120 years ago and ghostly activity has been reported ever since. The most famous ghost is Kate Morgan, a guest who never checked out of the hotel after killing herself while waiting for a husband or lover who never showed. She often plays tricks on guests staying in her former hotel room, but has also reportedly harassed honeymooning couples and taken long walks in the hotel's garden and on the beach.

The guest houses behind the main building were once used as slave quarters and a country-music loving ghost has been popping by cottage number four for at least 20 years. (Courtesy Hotel Maison de Ville Facebook) \nFort Garry Hotel, Winnipeg: This hotel was built in 1913 by the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and is considered to be one of the most haunted places in Canada.

Room 333 is probably the most haunted room in the entire hotel, visited by both the prince and other ghosts, including one who likes shoving guests out of the bed.

The mystery of room 873 is perhaps the most captivating. A family was reportedly murdered in this room, and though walls have been built over where the doorway once was, guests still report seeing ghosts of the family. Another rumour is that of the bride who fell down a staircase and broke her neck. The staircase is blocked off, but guests still report seeing a woman wandering the halls in a wedding dress.

The hotel offers a haunted maze year-round, but the hauntings on board are not just for show. The ghosts of two young women haunt the first class pool. One woman is believed to have drowned in the pool, while the other was murdered by a man in the change rooms. The sounds of metal and men screaming have also been heard at the front of the ship. These are thought to be the ghosts of the sailors of the HMS Curacao, which the Queen Mary split in half by mistake on the water.
