This time, Bernard Jenkin had gone too far. “On what basis,” she inquired haughtily, “have you decided that this was a ‘failing’ charity?” The Conservative MP for Harwich & N Essex met her glare equably. “It’s gone bust,” he said. Today’s meeting of the public administration select committee has a reasonable claim to being the single weirdest event in recent parliamentary history. This was three solid hours of bewildering excuses, recriminations and non sequiturs. At one point, Alan Yentob – chairman of Kids Company’s trustees, as well as a senior BBC executive – accused a 75-year-old widow of plaguing him with “abusive limericks”. Sadly he didn’t recite them. Perhaps he’s saving that for an episode of Imagine. In August, the children’s charity Kids Company was dissolved following a loss of funding, claims of financial mismanagement, and allegations of sexual abuse. This morning, MPs interrogated Ms Batmanghelidjh and Mr Yentob. Camila committee Photo: Parliament It was chaos from the start. The kaleidoscopically flamboyant Ms Batmanghelidjh – looking more than ever like a pile of Aladdin’s laundry – seemed incapable of giving a straight answer. Paul Flynn (Lab, Newport West) snapped that her replies were “verbal ectoplasm”. Mr Jenkin asked whether it was true that Kids Company routinely handed teenagers cash in brown envelopes . In the space of six seconds, Ms Batmanghelidjh said this was “a myth” and “not a myth”. She claimed Kids Company had been “intensely inspected”, but proved unable to recall when its last inspection took place. Kate Hoey (Lab, Vauxhall) asked about a £580,000 tax bill. Ms Batmanghelidjh replied that the money had been “conceptualised”. I can show you emails of limericks – abusive limericks – sent by that lady Alan Yentob, Creative Director, BBC Mr Flynn asked how spending £150 of the charity’s funds on a pair of shoes was supposed to help ease a client’s mental health problems. Ms Batmanghelidjh said the “structure of that question” was “immensely disrespectful”, and anyway, the mentally ill needed shoes too. Yes, said Mr Flynn, but why did they need to cost £150? Ms Batmanghelidjh said she didn’t know where he was “getting that from” because “I don’t have any records”. For some reason Mr Yentob kept putting his head in his hands. Perhaps he was just thinking deeply. Several times Ms Batmanghelidjh tried to place a reassuring hand on his arm. He would either ignore it, or move. Repeatedly she attempted to answer questions on his behalf; he, as calmly as he could, declined her assistance. MPs told her to be quiet. “I could be helpful!” trilled Ms Batmanghelidjh. Disbelievingly Mr Flynn read out a Kids Company document claiming that if it was shut down, swathes of South London would “descend into savagery”. Mr Yentob insisted that this was “not a wild exaggeration”, because there had since been stabbings and a murder . Mr Jenkin said he’d heard this was because local youths could no longer use Kids Company’s money to “pay their drug pushers”. In August, when Ms Batmanghelidjh was interviewed on the Today programme about Kids Company’s collapse, Mr Yentob was inside the studio, looming over the producer. Had he been trying to cow his BBC underlings into going easy on her? Not at all, protested Mr Yentob: “I was just there to listen to what Camila said.” If that was all Mr Yentob wanted, perhaps he might have considered switching on a radio. How on earth did he get into this mess? And how on earth will he get out of it? telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:54:25.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
