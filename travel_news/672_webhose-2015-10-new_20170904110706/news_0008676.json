Allways, being the Group’s Airport Meet &Greet Service brand, is being launched by phases in seven airports. This exclusive service is now available at Toronto Pearson International Airport and New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport, to be followed by airports in Singapore, Macau, Kuala Lumpur, Muscat and London Heathrow. The key highlight of the press conference was the unveiling of Aerotel in Singapore, a unique line of airport transit hotels under the Group. Aerotel in Singapore is the World’s only hotel to have an outdoor swimming pool and pool-side bar in the airside restricted area. Aerotel not only provides comfortable accommodation to transit travellers and those flying in the wee hours, but also features a range of attentive services and facilities including signature fragrance and soft acoustics, five-star mattress, powerful hot shower and natural skincare products to give travellers a home away from home coziness. This one-of-a-kind Aerotel will mark its soft opening today on Level 3 at the Departure Transit Lounge of Terminal 1 in Singapore Changi Airport (above Gate D41), with its subsequent opening in Abu Dhabi International Airport and London Heathrow Airport next year. Following the presentation was the inaugural launch announcement of Flight Club, a brand new dining concept specifically designed for airports. Fashioned after travellers’ own home and inspired by herbs and seeds, Flight Club is committed to bringing travelers a relaxed, unparalleled yet refreshing and educational dining experience, with the promise of eating healthy even on the road.Flight Club now opens 24/7 and is located on the Mezzanine Level in the Satellite Building (International Departures) of KL International Airport, Malaysia. Another most anticipated highlight at the press conference today was the announcement of new partnership with international airports and airlines. Plaza Premium Lounge, the flagship brand of the Group and the world’s largest independent airport lounge network, revealed two more strategic locations further to the eight new lounges confirmed earlier this year.“We are thrilled to join hands with both Taiwan Taoyuan and Galeão International Airports to bring Plaza Premium Lounge to Taipei and Rio de Janeiro respectively in the next few months. The dedication of these two airport authorities to providing excellent airport services matches perfectly with our heartfelt desire of delivering outstanding quality to travellers. I am highly confident that Plaza Premium Lounge in Brazil will perfect travellers’ airport experience during the upcoming Rio 2016 Summer Olympics.”Said Mr. Song Hoi-see, Founder & CEO of Plaza Premium Group. “Not only airports, airlines are also casting their vote of confidence in our outstanding quality and expertise. The grand opening of the flagship No.77 China Eastern Plaza Premium Lounge in Shanghai early next month will be the best testimony.” added Mr. Song. This flagship lounge is not only China Eastern Airlines’ first partnership with an international lounge management company, but also the World’s very first co-branded airport lounge between specialized lounge management company and airlines. This flagship airport lounge with a measure exceeding 19,000 square feet is located at Terminal 2 of Shanghai Pudong International Airport. Apart from holding the press conference, Plaza Premium Group has also set up an exhibition booth in Singapore to welcome ITB Asia buyers from today till 23rd October 2015.
