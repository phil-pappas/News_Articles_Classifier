As part of this landmark transaction in China's internet industry, Dianping and Meituan have jointly set up a new company that is expected to run the leading \"online to offline,\" or O2O, platform in China . This strategic cooperation is strongly supported by shareholders of both companies including Alibaba, Tencent and Sequoia Capital. China Renaissance acted as the exclusive financial advisor to both Dianping and Meituan in this transaction. Zhang Tao , CEO of Dianping, and Wang Xing , CEO of Meituan, are the co-Chairmen and co-CEOs of the new company.

The cooperation is expected to enable both companies to complement each other in their respective competitive strengths, and to push for innovation across China's O2O industry. \"Over the years, although the two companies were competing and had different focuses, we enjoyed the same goal of helping 10 million merchants to better serve one billion consumers in China , and in this regard, our commonalities far outweigh our differences,\" said Zhang Tao , CEO of Dianping. \"We both recognize the enormous potential of China's O2O industry, and therefore this strategic cooperation was a shared, and almost inevitable, decision. In addition, it also allows both companies to better leverage our respective advantages in order to accelerate product innovation, deepen service offerings, and speed up industry expansion. It will create more value for our consumers and merchants, foster a better O2O ecosystem, and facilitate broader industry development.\"\"Meituan is very happy to enter into this strategic cooperation with Dianping. It enables us to focus on better serving our consumers and merchants, and allows us to concentrate on developing new businesses and driving product innovation. This cooperation is the common wish for both management teams and our shareholders, and I expect both companies will have very positive chemistry working together. I am fully confident that together we will create an even brighter future,\" said Wang Xing , CEO of Meituan.
