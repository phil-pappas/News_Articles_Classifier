What about a little discretion so everyone who sees you take out your pillbox doesn't have to know it's a, well, pillbox? And would a bit of stylishness be too much to ask for? The folks at Gloria's Pill Cases have just the right prescription. The company's Zip-A-Round Travel Pill Case is a circular plastic seven-day pill organizer (each compartment is wedge-shaped) inserted into a fully lined round zippered case that looks like a jewelry holder. The 3.75-inch-diameter, 1.25-inch-high cases come in a variety or fabrics, colors, and patterns, from solid shades in textured faux leather to baseball, dinosaurs, and flower designs on cotton; and wild animal faux-skin patterns with sequins. The plastic pill-organizer inserts are secured inside the case via Velcro, and are removable (optional replacement inserts sold separately). The lid has an inside pocket for prescriptions or notes. My favorite product is the cotton Day and Night AM/PM set of two pill cases, each with a seven-day plastic organizer insert. The day case features a pale-blue sky with puffy white clouds; the night case is deep blue with white and gold stars.\nGloria's Pill Cases Day and Night AM/PM Set is $50; individual cases are $27 to $29; additional plastic inserts, $3.50; at www.gloriaspillcases.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:23:32.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
