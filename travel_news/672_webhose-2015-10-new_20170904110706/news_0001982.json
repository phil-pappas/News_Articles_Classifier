Without a large land mass to the north, winds in winter don't push extremely cold air into the continent as they do in the US or Asia. Europe is also, on average, drier than the US. \nA look at the map below shows where you can expect to find the most precipitation in Europe. Most of this, especially around the Mediterranean, will fall in winter. In the north, rains tend to start around October, while Paris has about ten wet days every month throughout the year. Germany tends to have more wet days in summer; Oktoberfest is held in Munich's best time to avoid rain. European Precipitation Map \nEurope Precipitation Map from HowStuffWorks European Climate Map \nThe climate map shows the basic climate zones in Europe. The pink indicates a Mediterranean climate, much like California, in which the summers are relatively dry and hot and winters wet with a moderate temperature outside the highlands. Much of the rest of Western Europe is influenced by the water surrounding it, the blue marine shading on the map. In general, northern Spain will be quite wet, especially in winter, with surprisingly moderate temperatures. \nEuropean Climate Map from HowStuffWorks Europe - When to Go \nThis question is an interesting and individual one. I like to to in October. It's still warm around the Med, but the intense heat has dissipated and the harvest festivals have begun. In Italy, I've found that this decent weather continues (in most years) through the middle of November, when cold, wet weather tends to make an abrupt appearance. To find out more about visiting Europe in October, see: October in Europe . \nSummer is a fine time to visit Scandinavia, and heat lovers will like the climate further south. Spring can bring those legendary showers, but wildflowers, including the European red poppy, can make it all worthwhile. You'll need an umbrella some days, but I don't bother packing and carrying one; I know that there will be street vendors (at least in the cities) offering cheap (yes, and cheaply made) umbrellas I can buy if the need arises and I won't feel bad discarding them later.
