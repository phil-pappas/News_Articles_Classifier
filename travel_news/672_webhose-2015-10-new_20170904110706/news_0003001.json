The participation in the event was part of the promotions for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Mr. Lummertz spoke about how Brazil is “Building a Tourism Brand Around Big Events”, explaining at the Forum how the efforts made in recent years to host the World Cup and the Olympics could lead to a major advancement in improving the infrastructure and services for Brazilians and visitors. According to Mr. Lummertz, the realization of the Pan American Games (2007), the 28th World Youth Day with Pope Francis (2013), the FIFA Confederations Cup (2013) and the FIFA World Cup (2014) have made Brazil a reliable country to hold investments in tourism. \nLummertz took the opportunity to talk about the Brazilian government's effort to eliminate the visa for Americans planning to visit Brazil next year. “The passage of the visa waiver bill by the Brazilian congress can help increase the number of American tourists to the country next year. But we are aiming to extend this visa waiver not just during the Olympics, but from January to September of 2016. This early opening can mean a lot, but we must go further,” he said. The measure will be voted by the Senate in the next couple weeks. \nThe visit was also an opportunity for the President to speak about other Brazilian destinations to the North American press. Lummertz suggested that the media should not just limit themselves to Rio de Janeiro. “Throughout the next year, Rio de Janeiro will be the main postcard and the gateway to our nation, but Brazil has so much more to offer to tourism in terms of natural beauty, sports, cuisine and culture. We propose that journalists and tourists worldwide visit other Brazilian cities before, during and after the Games,” Mr. Lummertz stressed. \nCurrently, the United States is the second most important market for Brazil, behind Argentina. In 2014, nearly 700 thousand American tourists visited the country. \nWith its spectacular beaches, lush rainforests, rich culture, exotic cuisine and exciting nightlife, Brazil is one of the most compelling countries to visit today. Travelers are invited to explore Brazil’s incredible geographical diversity – from the wetlands to the beaches. With a beautiful, tropical climate, Brazil is an easily accessible, exotic get-away for couples, families and business travelers.
