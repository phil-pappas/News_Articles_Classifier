According to the Irish Mirror , the man went berserk on Aer Lingus Flight 485 and bit another passenger before crew members were able to restrain him. The man became unconscious after he was restrained and was pronounced dead by a doctor on board before the flight made an emergency landing in Cork, RTE reports. The pilot told air traffic controllers that he was landing because the man had \"run amok\" on the plane and become \"extremely violent,\" reports the Mirror . A postmortem will be carried out Monday on the passenger, a 24-year-old Brazilian man who became agitated around halfway through the 2.5-hour flight, reports the Irish Times . The Times reports that the bitten man was taken to a hospital in Cork, while the other 166 passengers and crew members were taken to Dublin by bus because the aircraft is now a crime scene that will be examined by a forensics team.
