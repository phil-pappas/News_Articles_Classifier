Flood waters were rapidly rising after more than 8 inches of rain poured down with additional rain falling. \nThe National Weather Service office in Fort Worth reported that the water is rising faster than officials can close roads. \nAdditional severe flooding threatens to unfold into this weekend with the rest of Texas and Louisiana at the receiving end of a fire hose of tropical moisture. \nPeople in the South Central states should monitor the weather situation for flooding through this weekend, regardless of how dry the landscape has been. The hard, dry ground will cause a significant amount of the rain to run off. \nRainfall amounts between 4-8 inches will crawl to the south and east through portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. There is the potential for some communities to be hit with a foot or more of rain through Sunday night, especially in eastern Texas and far western Louisiana. \nMuch of the rain may fall in a single day or perhaps in a matter of hours. An area near Kerens, Texas, was inundated with 5.51 inches of rain in just seven hours on Friday. \nThe flooding will become far-reaching and affect the major cities of Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio and Brownsville, Texas, and Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana. \nIn portions of Texas and Louisiana, the situation could turn out similar to flooding this past May in the same areas. However, it is less possible the situation will become as extreme as the South Carolina flooding from early October. \nAreas that will first experience flash flooding will be low water crossings, small streams and mainly secondary roads. As the rain intensifies and persists over a given area, flooding will expand to urban areas, major highways and larger rivers. \nIn some communities, the flooding could become severe enough to force evacuations. Some roads and bridges could get washed away. \nThe main cause of the heavy rain and the flood risk will be tropical moisture from multiple sources converging on the South Central states. \nWith moisture from the Gulf of Mexico already in play, moisture from Major Hurricane Patricia will arrive this weekend and further enhance the torrential rainfall. \nPatricia rapidly intensified into the strongest hurricane on record early Friday morning and will barrel into southwestern Mexico Friday evening with catastrophic force. \nThe mountainous terrain of Mexico will quickly cause Patricia to weaken, but it will still approach Texas as a tropical rainstorm this weekend and will help another storm form near the Texas coast. \nThere is a chance that the new system could develop tropically, according to AccuWeather Hurricane Expert Dan Kottlowski. \n\"Winds created by the developing storm system could reach gale force during Sunday and Sunday night along the Texas and Louisiana coasts,\" he said. \"This will also bring coastal flooding due to onshore flow, especially during high tide.\" \nRegardless of tropical development or not, it will prolong the rainfall along the Texas coast and into Louisiana. The heavy rain will focus on the central Gulf Coast on Monday. \n\"We saw what happened in the spring time and it could certainly be a repeat performance,\" Kottlowski said. \nThe tropical moisture will spread to the Midwest and Eastern U.S. next week, leading to the most significant rainfall in a few weeks for many communities. \nAt the very least, travel disruptions are likely due to poor visibility and heavy rainfall. Lengthy airline delays are possible. Some roads may close. Motorists will need to reduce their speed to lower the risk of hydroplaning. \nNever attempt to drive through a flooded roadway. Doing so puts not only you and your occupants at risk for drowning, but also your would-be rescuers. \nThe current could be strong enough to sweep your vehicle downstream into deeper water as 1-2 feet of water is enough to cause most vehicles to lose control. The water level may rapidly rise across roadways, which may be compromised below the surface. \nParents are urged to keep their kids away from stream banks and culverts. The bank of a stream can give way, and rapidly rising water can sweep away onlookers.
