Based on the list price, the new order is valued at approximately 230 million euro (262 million US)[1]. The contract also includes an option for an additional 32 locomotives.\nBoaz Tzafrir, CEO of Israel Railways, said, “The Israel Railways electrification project is advancing and becoming a reality. The transition to electric operation, a standard practice in all advanced countries, will be a significant leap forward in every field relating to the operation of the Israel Railways and a key factor in Israel Railways’ future growth.”\nYossi Daskal, Chief Country Representative and Head of Sales Israel, Bombardier Transportation, said, “We feel honored to have been selected for this significant order. We have been working in close partnership with Israel Railways for decades, having already delivered and retrofitted a large fleet of double deck coaches. Our long term relationship with Israel Railways is based on a clear understanding of how our transport solutions can continue to best meet the mobility needs of the people of Israel.”\nThe TRAXX locomotive is based on a highly reliable and versatile locomotive platform that has proven its technology through years of successful operations across Europe. Designed for speeds up to 160 km/h, the new TRAXX AC locomotives will be mainly used to power Israel’s fleet of 369 BOMBARDIER TWINDEXX Vario double deck coaches currently in use. The locomotives also feature the highly reliable and field proven BOMBARDIER MITRAC TC 3300 AC Traction Converter as well as universal MITRAC drives, which include the latest generation of traction motors and gearboxes.\nThe new locomotives will be nearly identical to the TRAXX AC locomotives already in service with German Rail Operator, Deutsche Bahn and, as ISR’s first electrically powered rolling stock, will play a key role in Israel’s program to electrify its rail network. The first deliveries are planned for the end of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:25:03.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
