With our first trip to the Grand Canyon’s North Rim, it was hard not to feel the same amazement that Powell and his crew felt. We had spent the previous weeks seeing the sixth spectacular national parks of Utah and Nevada. After the amazing scenery of Great Basin, Nev., and Bryce, Arches and the other parks in Utah, we wondered, \"How can we end this spectacular trip?\" Despite four previous visits to the Grand Canyon, we had not been to the North Rim. But in planning for this trip, maps indicated the canyon is just 150 miles south of our Utah destinations. We were inspired, in part, by recent reading of the book \"Down the Great Unknown\" by Edward Dolnick. The book profiles the voyage 146 years ago into the American Southwest (an area uncharted on U.S. maps at the time) by Powell and his novice crew of explorers. After two months narrowly avoiding drowning and near-starvation along the Green and Colorado rivers, Powell and his crew entered the Grand Canyon in early August. Powell, a geologist, waxed poetic, \"in the Grand Canyon there are thousands of gorges like that below Niagara Falls and there are 1000 Yosemites. Pluck up Mt. Washington ... and drop it headfirst into the Grand Canyon … Pluck up the Blue Ridge and hurl it into the Grand Canyon and it will not fill it,\" labeling the canyon’s multi-hued cliffs, \"the most sublime spectacle on earth.\" A six-hour drive from Utah’s Arches National Park took us southwest across the mighty Colorado, then up to Kaibob Plateau at 8,800 feet. We rolled into the DeMotte Campground (USFS), with 38 sites, just $9 per night with our senior pass, had dinner and planned our visit to the Grand Canyon, which was 18 miles away. Entering the park early the next morning, we were surprised to see a herd of about 30 buffalo in a broad meadow. We later found that the initial bison were brought from Yellowstone Park in 1906 by a rancher hoping to breed bison with cows and produce an animal with lean, tender meat. His experiment failed, and the animals went to the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Over the past 15 years, the herd, now approaching 500 head, has stayed mostly within park boundaries. The next morning we had our choice of numerous campsites right on the North Rim, then, off to the Grand Canyon Lodge for breakfast and the short hike to Bright Angel Point, just below the lodge, for an incredible view of the abyss. A longer hike along the Transept Trail took us 3 miles round-trip, from the lodge along the rim. Later, the Bridle Trail took us to the intersection of the North Kaibab Trail where we contemplated, fleetingly, the 7-mile, 5,000-foot elevation descent to Phantom Ranch and the bottom of the canyon. The next day, we motored 8 miles to Point Imperial, the highest point on rim at 8,803 feet, where the Colorado River is 7 miles away and almost 6,000 feet below. Here, the trail offers an easy 4-mile round trip, passing along the rim and burned acreage of the 2000 Outlet Fire (resplendent in the changing yellow leaves of Quaking Aspen trees). Then, we headed toward Cape Royal, about 18 miles southwest. From Walhalla Overlook, one can gaze at the Unkar Creek Delta, six miles below, which was excavated in the summers of 1967 and 1968 and where numerous Anasazi sites were discovered, including one complex with 25 rooms. The Ancestral Puebloans lived here 1,100 to 800 years ago, terracing the delta so they could cultivate corn, squash and beans with water from the creek and river. During the hot summer months, the tribes would move to the rim and an area called Walhalla Glades. Just across the road from the overlook are the remains of stone foundations of their homes. It would take tribes two days of hiking to move from the river delta up to the rim. We continued on to Cape Royal. A short trail offers trail markers that explain the area's natural history and offers expansive views of the canyon, Angels Window and the distant Colorado River. On our final morning, after one last gaze into the sun rising over this awesome park, we headed north on Highway 67. More than 50 mule deer and a dozen wild turkeys bid us farewell — the bison were absent. We decided to take a meandering route home. From the Grand Canyon, we found Pipe Spring National Monument outside the tiny town of Moccasin, Ariz. Pipe Spring is one of those unique places in nature where a spring bubbles water to the surface in wet and dry years. It was discovered by the Ancestral Puebloans about 1,300 years ago, then settled by Mormon pioneers in the late 1850s. They brought sheep and cattle, built a dugout and corrals, and planted orchards and vineyards. Today, the complex features Windsor Castle, a fort-like structure to defend against marauding Navajo tribes, a garden highlighting plants grown by Mormon settlers and native Americans, and animals such as Longhorn cattle. It's a worthy stop for a unique early-American learning experience. Our return trip took us through Nevada on Highway 375, the Extraterrestrial Highway. It was officially so designated in 1996 after years of driver's reports of UFOs and other alien incidents. The 98-mile stretch skirts the edge of Nellis Air Force Base and past top-secret Area 51 — likely prompting many of these reports. A lonely road, we saw nothing but dry territory and five wild horses. Eventually, we connected with California Highway 120. As luck would have it, this road borders the south end of Mono Lake, and we hit it at sunset — beautiful, if accidental, timing. After a final night of camping on the edge of Yosemite National Park — dreaming of future U.S. travel explorations — we headed home. A magical trip! — Contact Tim Viall at tviall@msn.com.
