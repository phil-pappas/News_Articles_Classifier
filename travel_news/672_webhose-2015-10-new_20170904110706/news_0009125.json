The gay lifestyle magazine’s annual awards celebrate the past year of celebrity, politics, fashion, music, entertainment, film and the people who have made a difference to the LGBT community in the past 12 months. \nThe evening included a red carpet arrival followed by a drinks reception in the Undercroft. Dinner was served in the Main Hall, which was dressed with a large red theatre curtain as the backdrop courtesy of Whitelight. Guests enjoyed a sumptuous menu designed by Food by Dish which included Beetroot tartare to start; a main course of braised lamb shank and savoy cabbage roulade; followed by vanilla crème brûlée egg for dessert. Following dinner, there were performances from Adam Lambert and VV Brown before the awards ceremony began. Those honoured on the night included One Direction’s Liam Payne, presenter Reggie Yates for his BBC Three documentary Extreme Russia, Newsnight presenter Evan Davis, actor Cyril Nri, and musicians Adam Lambert and Jess Glynne. Alexander McQueen was also recognised posthumously with Attitude’s Legend Award. After the awards, guests were invited back into the Undercroft where they were treated to Oscartini cocktails and were kept entertained by a DJ, dance machine and Los Angeles inspired photo booth. Jennifer Lockham, Banqueting House Manager, said: “It was fantastic to host the Attitude Awards for a second year running. The versatility of the event spaces at Banqueting House meant we were able to accommodate all of the necessary requirements meaning the awards were once again a huge success.” Mike Buckley, Managing Director, Attitude Magazine, says: “It was a fantastic evening as always. Banqueting House worked so well last year, it ticks all our boxes. There are lots of different things that we need - it needs to be big enough to have a red carpet, we need somewhere in central London, we need somewhere you can have an after party and a drinks reception that’s separate from the Main Hall, and look at it, it’s just such a superb building. It’s definitely our venue of choice.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:44:02.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
