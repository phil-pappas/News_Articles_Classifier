Things are looking up for most – of all sizes – but growth will be a matter of seizing opportunities and not simply an inevitability of having survived. With low inflation, falling oil prices and increased household disposable incomes, many businesses do now have at least some reason for optimism for the final quarter of 2015 and beyond. A recent survey by the Institute of Directors found that six in 10 of its members believe that revenues will increase over the coming year. As a small business, we can attract great talent because we can offer more opportunity and impact than larger peers But the outlook isn’t quite clear. Despite this positivity, research conducted by Bibby Financial Services found that, while business size didn’t affect how optimistic respondents felt about the future, smaller businesses (with fewer than 250 employees) are less likely to be investing over the coming 12 months than larger businesses, and 17pc less likely to know their organisation’s business plan. Of those small businesses that are investing, new technology (63pc), staff training (50pc) and staff recruitment (48pc) are the priorities for the immediate future – sound investments to stabilise or prepare a business for growth, but certainly costly. Aron Gelbard, chief executive officer of online florists Bloom & Wild, explains that, for micro-businesses, it is difficult to weigh up priorities in the current climate. He says: “As a small business, our single biggest investment is in our people. I believe we can attract great talent because we can offer more opportunity and impact than larger peers. “We also know that we need to grow our team to deliver our growth ambitions. Our unit economics are attractive but we want to build a household brand, which requires a much bigger team. I am excited to focus my investment on creating new jobs for talented individuals.” The issue of juggling financial priorities is not unique to one sector, and is proving a challenge for all kinds of small businesses who want to turn their optimism into reality. For micro-businesses, it is difficult to weigh up priorities in the current climate Spanish foods maker Zantiago has just signed its first contract with a major high-street retailer and is now looking at growth targets. Zantiago founder James Macdonald says the priorities for his team are financing for promotion, branding, in-store testing and further expansion. “The priority for us is to get more products on more shelves,” he explains. “We want to be a recognisable business with recognisable brands. That takes money and time.” Like many small business owners, Mr Macdonald was frustrated with high-street banks and didn’t want the hoop-jumping required by some private equity investors. As a result, Zantiago is one business turning to unusual methods to overcome growth challenges: in this case, crowdfunding. “The one that we have spoken with at length is Crowdcube,” Mr Macdonald says. “They seem to have the infrastructure to help people through the process.” He says the crowdfunding pathway has been relatively stress-free by comparison, but isn’t surprised at the research which suggests that just 15pc of small businesses would consider crowdfunding as their first port of call. “It is still new and, because it is new, people just don’t understand what it means,” he explains. “If a small business tries to raise private money, it can be hard work and put a lot of pressure on the business. Crowdfunding can be a better step for a small businesses entering growth phase.” Focus on funding: think outside the box Many businesses are finding that funding growth from alternative finance is an attractive option. One of the best known is invoice financing. Members of the Asset Based Finance Association (ABFA) provide £9bn to SMEs against the value of their invoices. Jeff Longhurst, chief executive of ABFA, says many SMEs now see invoice finance as “an established part of the funding mix.” He is bullish about the sector, adding: “Businesses need to recognise that their unpaid invoices are an asset.” Another growing source of funding is borrowing against hard assets such as inventory, plant and real estate. ABFA says a record £4.2bn of alternative finance is now secured against such assets, up 9pc on a year ago. Mr Longhurst says: “For those businesses with substantial assets tied up in warehouses or plant and machinery, this can be an excellent way to access lending to drive investment.’’ • Read more about how asset based finance supports business growth at www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:47:22.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
