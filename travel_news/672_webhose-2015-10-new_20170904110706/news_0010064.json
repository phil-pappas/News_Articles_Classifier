The goal of this project is to raise $15,000 CAD by November 5, 2015. The funds raised will go towards the expense of putting on the solo show. Backers of this project will receive some very exclusive and unique content from the photo collections used to make the exhibition's artwork. Including limited edition prints, personalized message from the artist and even some custom pieces.\nTo help bring this incredible exhibit to life, please visit the Kickstarter campaign or click here . Perks will be delivered between November 2015 and March 2016.\nPlease keep in mind this is an “all-or-nothing” deal, which means if the campaign does not reach the funding goal then the project cannot move forward. So know that any amount given can make a difference, and this is an incredible opportunity to be a part of a special campaign! Help Nathan Gilbert reach the goal by sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks. The more people know about this, the more support the campaign will receive.\nContact: Nathan Gilbert\nTitle: Artist - Photographer\nPhone: 514-531-3516\nemail: This email address is being protected from spambots.
