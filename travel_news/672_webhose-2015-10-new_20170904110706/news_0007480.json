The resort, which sits in the shadow of the 4,810m Mont Blanc, offers visitors the chance to enjoy classic French hospitality and extensive slopes – all within an hour’s drive of Geneva airport. Saint-Gervais shares its pistes with neighbouring Megève and both resorts are part of the Evasion Mont-Blanc ski area, with a whopping 445km of pistes to explore. The ski area also includes the villages of Combloux and Les Contamines and offers terrain for all abilities, from cruising runs through pine forests to expert off-piste routes – all of which are accompanied by spectacular views of the highest peak in the Alps. Saint-Gervais is offering the chance to win a short break for two, including three nights b&b in a three-star ski-in/ski-out hotel, return airport transfers, equipment hire and three-day area lift passes. The prize also includes lunch on the slopes at a different gourmet mountain restaurant each day: La Fruitière by La Folie Douce, Le Tremplin de la Croix and Sous les Freddy’s. For more information visit saintgervais.com Closing date for entries is December 5 2015. Terms and conditions apply.
