The BMW plant in nearby Greer is currently undergoing a $1 billion expansion and will produce 450,000 X-series vehicles annually by the end of 2016, supporting a workforce of more than 9,000. This is BMW’s largest plant anywhere in the world. The BMW plant tour is should not be missed. It is an absolute trip highlight and a unique educational experience for children and adults alike. Book very early as this tour fills up months in advance. Beauty, activities and culture Nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Greenville is a walkable town. The downtown is centered along the Reedy River which features a unique floating suspension bridge and a multi-tiered waterfall. A thriving arts community, restaurants, cafes, antique shops, boutiques, annual festivals, historic sites, museums, craft breweries and spectacular scenery are all here to be enjoyed. Greenville’s streets are filled with murals, sculptures, street art and fountains. The “Mice on Main Street” exhibit is creative and unique. The many colleges and universities located here add to the cultural diversity and ambience. Falls Park on the Reedy River is the best place to begin your exploration. The nearby Swamp Rabbit Trail follows the river for 17.5 miles to Travelers Rest, and is a great spot for walkers, runners, bike riders and nature and wildlife enthusiasts. Fluor Field at the WestEnd, home of the Greenville Drive, one of the Red Sox Minor League affiliate teams, offers great baseball in a small stadium atmosphere, and tickets are just $10. The stadium is modeled after Fenway Park with its own 30-foot-tall “Green Monster” in left field. The dimensions all around the outfield wall are to the same specifications as Fenway, including “Pesky’s Pole” in right field. Like Fenway it has real grass and a manual scoreboard. For those who like craft beer and Carolina “moonshine” you will find many places to sample. The Dark Corner Distillery on Main Street is a good starting point. For music lovers, Blues Boulevard offers jazz and blues in a casual atmosphere nightly. For the back-to childhood experience for adults and a great place for kids, I suggest the Miniature World of Trains. Nearby towns You don’t necessarily need a car to get around Greenville as most of the nearby hotels have complimentary shuttle service to and from downtown. If you have a car, take a daytrip to nearby Hendersonville, North Carolina, about 42 miles away, or Asheville, North Carolina, 62 miles. Both are easy round-trips that can be done in a single day. Optionally, take a short drive to the Campbell Covered Bridge in Landrum, South Carolina, just 27 miles from Greenville. This an ideal place for beautiful photos and an afternoon picnic.
