Just a few months ago it was struggling but things seem to be changing for the better. Australian tour operators can sniff lucrative business and are willing to make the most of it. The plunge in the currency over the past 18 months into the so-called “sweet spot” of US70-75¢ will make an Australian holiday an easier sell.\nThe managing director of Southern World Australia – who specialises in bringing Western markets, rather than emerging Asian markets – says he will have his foreign exchange app on his phone ready at the World Travel Market fair in London to show potential customers how much cheaper an Australian holiday is now compared to two years ago.\nAs the mining boom fizzles, the tourism industry is experiencing a resurgence just at the right time.\nThe lower dollar is luring more international visitors and, more importantly, getting them to spend more money when they are here. Domestic tourists who were once tempted offshore to Bail, Fiji, Thailand or Hawaii for a beach holiday are now heading back to local options such as the Gold Coast.\nThe latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show international arrivals in Australia were 6.5 per cent higher in the 12 months to August. Last financial year, international visitors spent a record $33.4 billion – up 10 per cent – according to Tourism Research Australia.\nTourism Australia managing director John O’Sullivan says big jumps in consumer expenditure in the March and June quarter are the real bonus of the latest tourism boom.\nTourism consultant Peter Hook, whose client base ranges from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland to Kakadu in the Northern Territory, says there weren’t enough rooms for tourists in the capital cities of Darwin, Perth and Brisbane during the mining boom and the tourism business suffered as a result.\nBut that pressure has now eased and new hotels that expected to cater to mining executives find they are filling up with tourists.\nThe luxury boutique hotel group COMO – which has only 12 hotels worldwide, including London, Bali, the Maldives and Phuket – opened its first hotel in Australia this week. COMO the Treasury in Perth will target high-end travellers and the corporate market. It is part of a wave of hotels set to open in Australia over the next few years. ​In a bid to attract wealthy travellers, the hotel in the city’s old Treasury building will offer top-end restaurants, bars and shopping experiences for guests. The entry point for its 48 rooms is $595 per night.\nMore competitive airfares from new operators in the Australian market have taken the country off the one-off bucket list and attracted return customers who are spending up big once they exchange their currency at the airport. Total outbound visitors still exceed arrivals, but the rate of growth of inbound traffic in the past year is almost three times higher than outbound traffic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:17:55.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
