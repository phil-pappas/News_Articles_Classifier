It is also known for being managed well. Modi said that the government will give much stress to tourism growth, as it helps to also create jobs. \nThe new capital at Amravati has attracted investment from Singapore and Japan as well, and the first phase will be completed in 10 years. \nThe old state of Andhra Pradesh has been divided into Telengana and Andhra, hence the need for a new capital.
