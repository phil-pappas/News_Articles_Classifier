Travel agents were named as the most popular booking method for four out of the six categories, including 7+ night holidays, honeymoons and trips to new destinations. The most likely reason for this is that for these kind of trips, which typically involve larger sums of money and complexity, people particularly want the added experience, expertise and assistance of a travel professional to make sure the holiday goes smoothly and that their money is well spent.\nTable 1.2 – How likely people are to use different booking methods for certain types of holiday **\n City break Honeymoon Trip to a new destination Last minute break 7+ night holiday Domestic holiday Directly with a tour operator 22% 31% 24% 23% 25% 23% Holiday booking website (e.g. Expedia, Opodo) 38% 40% 34% 38% 35% 37% Directly with the service providers (e.g. hotel/house stay and airline) 44% 43% 37% 41% 39% 46% With a travel agent (either high street or online 39% 49% 47% 44% 44% 38%\nWhile travel agents were the most popular booking method for the majority of trip types, all booking methods enjoyed significant popularity for each type of holiday, highlighting the importance of choice and variety in the industry. Nearly a third (31%) of people prefer to book their honeymoon directly with a tour operator, while a quarter (25%) are likely to book a 7+ night holiday directly with a tour operator.\nMark Tanzer, ABTA Chief Executive commented: “The travel industry offers incredible variety for holidaymakers and this is reflected in the different ways people choose to book their holiday. The findings suggest that where travel professionals really come into their own is assisting people with higher value and more complex trips and providing that personal touch and insight. For example, a honeymoon is a big investment, both emotionally and financially, and people value that added assurance of knowing things have been taken care of by a professional. It is encouraging to see holidaymakers recognising this and continuing to seek that expertise, whether they find it online or on the high street.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:41:09.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
