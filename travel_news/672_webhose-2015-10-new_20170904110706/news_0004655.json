With sailings throughout the holiday week, these cruises keep all the traditions intact, while adding fun and inventive ways to celebrate the feast. From pumpkin-pie cocktails to post-dinner NFL games shows on jumbo screens, the comforts of home have never been more buoyant. Princess Cruises \nThe newest ship in Princess Cruises ’ fleet of eighteen, Regal Princess debuted in May 2014 as the sister ship to Royal Princess . Departing November 22 from Fort Lauderdale, the ship will be calling on Princess Cays, St. Thomas, and St. Maarten during a seven-night cruise. A traditional holiday feast is served in all three of the ship’s main dining rooms, and autumnal accents decorate the ship as special events for the whole family include a turkey-carving demonstration, a turkey-calling contest, and a pumpkin-themed Jr. Chef@Sea bake-off, in which kids create their own dessert creations. Be sure to stop by the Tree of Thanks in Regal Princess 's atrium, a Princess tradition where guests add notes of gratitude to the tree’s branches. And rounding out the complete Thanksgiving experience, the ship streams NFL games on a large outdoor screen. \nPlan Your Trip: Visit Fodor’s Princess Cruises Guide Royal Caribbean \nAt the forefront of onboard innovation and family fun, Anthem of the Seas debuted this past April.
