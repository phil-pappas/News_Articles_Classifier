(AP Photo/Jacques Brinon) \nRoad access to Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris was briefly disrupted, and some flights suffered delays.\nAlthough Monday's scuffle was unusually violent, labour relations in France are commonly testy, with unions sometimes even resorting to holding managers hostage — or \"boss-napping\" — to make a point.\nAir France denounced the violence and said it will push ahead anyway with its restructuring plans, after failing to reach an agreement with pilots.\nAlexandre de Juniac, the CEO of Air France-KLM, said the company is being squeezed by low-cost airlines in Europe and Gulf carriers for long-haul flights. Monday's meeting was intended to detail the cuts.\nAirline executives told reporters Monday the plan involves laying off 2,900 staff, abolishing five routes and 35 weekly long-haul flights, primarily in Asia and the Middle East.\nAmong those at Monday's protest was Yves Porte, an activist who represents cargo workers.\n\"The Gulf companies, who have low fuel prices and who receive government subsidies, compete with us. It's impossible, we are not on a level playing field,\" he said.\nAir France said it would file a complaint for aggravated assault.\nFrance's transport secretary, Alain Vidalies, condemned the violence, saying in a tweet it was \"unacceptable and must be punished.\"\nDeputy human resources director Xavier Broseta, one of the executives disrobed by protesters, told reporters later that he had received messages of sympathy from colleagues throughout the day, including from union leaders.\n\"We are fighting every day for an Air France that will have lasting growth,\" he said later, after donning a new jacket and tie. \"Violence and intimidation will have no part of that.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:48:06.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
