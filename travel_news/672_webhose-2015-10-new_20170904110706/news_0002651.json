While he did not reveal the value of the sale, industry sources estimates place it at 750 million euros (US$844 million). No timeline is given yet, although Hidalgo added: “I am not in a hurry”. \n\nTrade sources suggest protracted sell-off negotiations are expected to include a clause that overall control will eventually pass to HNA once Hidalgo decides to retire. \n\nHNA has interests in the real estate, aviation, hospitality and travel industries, and also owns and operates Hainan Airlines, China’s largest privately-owned air transportation company. \n\nGlobalia, whose divisions include the Halcón Viajes travel agency chain, Be Live Hotels and tour operator Travelplan, has come out of Spain’s economic crisis reasonably well with sales up 8 per cent to 3.2 billion euros last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:59:53.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
