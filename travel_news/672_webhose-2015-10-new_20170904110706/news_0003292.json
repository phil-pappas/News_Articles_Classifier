(NASDAQ: SINO) (\"Sino-Global\" or the \"Company\"), a Virginia company engaged in shipping, chartering, logistics and related services, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase program.\nDuring the quarter ending December 31, 2015 , the Company intends to repurchase up to $100,000 of its common stock. Thereafter the Company may repurchase an aggregate value of shares per quarter equal to 10% to 15% of Sino-Global's quarterly net income for which the most recent quarterly or annual report has been filed. The Company will repurchase the shares in the open market from time to time, subject to market conditions and at management's discretion. The program was authorized and went into effect on October 11, 2015 and will last through the next twelve months. The Company will cooperate with a licensed broker to administer the plan in compliance with the safe harbor provided by Rule 10b-18.\nMr. Lei Cao, Chief Executive Officer of Sino-Global, commented: \"We believe that Sino-Global's current stock price does not reflect the Company's true value. This share repurchase program reconfirms our confidence in and commitment to Sino-Global's future. As the Company continues to build its logistics network and expand its service platform, the share repurchase program should position us well for long-term growth, as we remain focused on returning value to our shareholders.\"\nAbout Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd.\nFounded in the United States in 2001, Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. is a company engaged in shipping, chartering, logistics and related services.
