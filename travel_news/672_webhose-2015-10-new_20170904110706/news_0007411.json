Coffee culture in Britain has come a long way in the past few years. Derek Lamberton, editor of London’s Best Coffee website, says: \"A lot more of us now want to know where our beans come from, how they are processed and who roasts them.\" Bean there, done that: Derek Lamberton Even the language of coffee, used by commercial bean buyers and experts, is spreading, along with the idea of matching different coffees with food other than just biscuits or cake. Coffee beans come from two main species of the caffea plant, the astringent, high-caffeine robusta (typical of espresso) and the more mellow and widespread arabica. There are countless varieties of arabica bean with flavours all their own but their region of origin, processing and roasting all influence taste. Lamberton says that, when enjoying coffee at home, grinding the beans fresh at the time ensures that you can fully savour their characteristics. But he also suggests going to artisan coffee shops. \"By talking to knowledgeable baristas you can develop an appreciation for regional or varietal differences and how processing affects taste.\" In Mexico coffees such as Maragogype are prized for their acid-sweet balance. Medium-roasted, they provide a lovely start to the day Ethiopia is thought to be where the coffee plant originated and \"produces some of the most sought-after and flavoursome beans in the world\", he says. When Ethiopian beans are dried naturally they can yield flavours as full and fruity as a red wine, especially a variety such as Mocha, from Sidamo provence. You could happily serve this sort of coffee, espresso-style, at the end of a meal with plump summer strawberries dipped in really dark chocolate. But washed beans, where the fruit is stripped from the bean straight after harvesting, bring out a more floral, citrusy, almost tea-like elegance. These qualities are particularly evident in an Ethiopian variety, Yirgacheffe, and go beautifully with more delicate foods such as lavender-scented all-butter shortbread. Lamberton says: \"It was a Yirgacheffe that got me interested in speciality coffee in the first place. I suddenly realised I had never previously tasted a properly roasted coffee of that quality. I was hooked.\" Good buddies: coffee and chocolate are the perfect pairing Kenyan coffee, by contrast, is often grown in full sun, leading to robust, complex flavours countered by a refreshing tartness. The coffees can provide a foil to the richness of chocolate cake and, light-roasted, a surprisingly balanced partner to glazed fruit tarts. Some of the best arabica beans are grown in Central and South America. In Guatemala and Mexico, coffees such as the legendary Maragogype are prized for their acid-sweet balance. Medium-roasted, they preserve their integrity and provide a lovely start to the day. In Melbourne barristas brew this sort of coffee to serve with a brunch of smashed avocado on sourdough toast. Colombian are among the most widely appreciated coffees. The best are mellow with a hint of caramel and pleasing nuttiness. Grown at high altitudes, the beans take longer to ripen and develop more aromatic, complex flavours. The coffees are versatile, enjoyable mid-morning or at the end of an evening meal. They even complement apple crumble. Brazil is a large coffee producer from varieties such as Bourbon and the flavours tend to be at the heavier end, with a chocolatey, nutty richness. An espresso made from a rich Brazilian blend can easily handle the unctuous piquancy of dark chilli chocolate or even firm, full-flavoured cheeses, as Lamberton suggests: \"savoury food pairings can be a revelation and coffee and cheese is an interesting one.\" Taste explosion: invite friends over for a coffee and cheese night and discover a new world of flavour Indonesia has a great coffee-growing tradition. Its Sumatran coffees can be earthy and well suited to darker roasting – often dominated by rich, smoky aromas, toasty flavours and a buttery \"mouthfeel\". Such flavours can add a distinctive note to a tiramisù or a savoury twist to a barbecue. Simply marinate your steak in a couple of shots of cold espresso to flavour and tenderise. As Lamberton concludes: \"One of the most exciting aspects of coffee is how quickly the scene is developing.\" Your barista at home For artisan coffee at home, the De’Longhi Eletta Cappuccino Top provides an unbeatable, fresh bean to cup experience.
