And hey, without these mavericks we wouldn't have Fifty Shades of Grey , or… um… any of those other famous self-published projects. Add skiing into this heady mix, and you have just about the best niche genre going. So much hard graft deserves to be appreciated, and so we'll be reading and reviewing the very best in vanity publishing ski books that literature has to offer. Skiing With Demons: The Morzine Chalet Project Author: Chris Tomlinson He says: \"1.2 million Britons go skiing every year and most of them come back. Around thirty die through misadventure. Only a dozen or so are killed by avalanches, a few from crashing into immovable objects or each other, however the majority die in what are known as ‘alcohol related incidents’ – usually by freezing to death. Learn how Tomlinson overcame his fear of the Swiss Wall \"This book is my skiing memoir and includes one fatal avalanche, a few crashes and numerous alcohol related incidents. It documents my transition from a city-living ad man to a garage-dwelling ski bum and rookie ski instructor over four ski seasons in the French alpine town of Morzine . More importantly, it documents the price I paid for living my dream. \"Everything described in this book, to the best of my recollection, actually happened.\" We say: Picture a book. Got it? Good. Now, take that book, and imagine it has been written by a middle-aged ski bum with a budding alcohol problem. NOW add in a Land Rover affectionately nicknamed \"Landie\", and some fairly sexist references to a phenomenon dubbed Girlfriend Skiing – and you have yourself a classic example of self-published ski-lit my friend. It's like Knight Rider and Homer Simpson had a strange, rambling, snowy baby. Mmm. Racer Lindsey Vonn is no doubt in need of some \"Girlfriend Skiing\" Photo: Getty Images You know you're on to a winner when a book opens with an anecdote about waking up in a French hospital after getting wrecked the night before for no discernible reason (say it with me: LAD). Anyone who's ever done a ski season will identify , although most of them will be remembering experiences from when they were 18 rather than 45. But don't worry – this isn't some boring inspirational story entitled 12 Steps at a Time: One Man's Journey to Sobriety. Oh no, this is Skiing With Demons , and the partying don't stop for nobody. In Tomlinson's words, \"It’s hard to tell if you’ve got a drinking problem or not when you work in a ski resort. Binge drinking and skiing are inextricably linked sports.\" Amen to that, brother. • The best resorts for partying It's not all boozing with beelzebub though – we also get to live the low points of the author's divorce, which is about as depressing as it sounds. It’s hard to tell if you’ve got a drinking problem or not when you work in a ski resort Soon spirits are lifted though by the insulting insinuation that women can't ski: \"Girlfriend skiing means setting off for the day knowing that the deepest powder you’re likely to meet will be the chocolate on top of a cappuccino and the steepest encounter you’ll have to deal with will be the lunch bill. It involves a late start, usually due to some excessive ski-faffing, cruising some blues, a midmorning drink and loo stop (usually not synchronised), a two-hour lunch, then a gentle ski back to the resort for an early après session. \"Before taking anyone GF skiing, it’s imperative to establish that you are indeed a significantly better skier than they are – no bloke wants to be out-skied by their girlfriend.\" It's especially good to read these passages just after watching the recently released film Suffragette , so you can get properly incensed, shout \"Votes for women!\" and then throw something heavy. Skiing With Demons' sexist bits are great to read after watching Suffragette When you've finally calmed down, the positive take-home message is this: Despite being an alcohol-dependent forty-something undergoing a fairly major mid-life crisis, Tomlinson manages to qualify as a ski instructor, get a nice girlfriend (who presumably allows him to belittle her skiing ability on a regular basis) and take on the infamous Swiss Wall black run in the Portes du Soleil ski area.
