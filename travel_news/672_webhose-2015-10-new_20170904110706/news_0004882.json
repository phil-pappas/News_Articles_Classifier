Handmade in New York with 18k or 20k fairtrade gold, diamonds and flawless gemstones, Misahara fine jewelry is made for women who are confident, worldly and socially responsible, all characteristics of its founder Lepa Galeb-Roskopp . Misahara will launch at Neiman Marcus Palo Alto followed by Neiman Marcus Palm Beach with specific pieces designed for each store. Retail prices range from $5,450 to $89,600 and the collection includes colorful earrings, one-of-a-kind, cocktail rings, cuff bracelets and necklaces. Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278632 Lepa Galeb-Roskopp's world travels are the inspiration for all her jewelry designs. \"I created Misahara fine jewelry in 2013 for women like myself who have the confidence and artistic flair to wear unique pieces of jewelry. It's about acquiring and wearing something that has meaning,\" explained Galeb-Roskopp. \"Each piece channels my bi-cultural background and begins as a feeling or something that I've seen. We are proud of our impeccable craftsmanship that uses only the finest fair-trade precious metals and flawless gemstones\", she added. All Misahara jewelry is made in New York . Earrings are made to such a precise gram requirement so as not to weigh down the ear and the weight distribution of each necklace is carefully considered to avoid it being uncomfortable. This high degree of attention is paid to each piece of Misahara jewelry to ensure that customers get exactly what they paid for: an exquisite and wearable piece of fine jewelry. Misahara is both enigmatic and romantic, a name made up of the letters from Lepa's children and World Cup mountain bike champion Greg Minnaar , who is a partner in the company. Both Lepa and her husband recently started True Cause Foundation in the US to help disadvantaged children get a better education. The triangular shaped Unity symbol, also cast in 18k or 20k gold, appears on each piece of jewelry as a symbol for the relationship between one's search for greatness in the world through the physical and spiritual journeys we take. Misahara's US flagship boutique recently opened at the legendary Plaza Hotel in New York City . The other boutique is located at the luxurious marina in Porto Montenegro, the jewel of the Adriatic.
