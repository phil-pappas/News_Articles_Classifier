The unique culture, fine weather and environment, delicious food and giant pandas have all added their charm, too. “The weather is fine, the roads are clean and the people here are very nice? I enjoy living here very much” Mark Bancroft, British Chamber of Commerce in China Richard Tams, British Airways’ executive vice-president for China, said he was pleased with the performance of the nonstop Chengdu-London flight, which was launched two years ago. “Chengdu is a key route for British Airways as it broadens our network in China in addition to our existing routes from Beijing and Shanghai,” he said. “We’re excited about the city’s future and the role Britain and BA will play in this.” BA launched the direct Chengdu-London service in September 2013, becoming the first to link the British capital with a city in central or western China. Within eight months, the airline had increased the number of flights from three to five a week and introduced the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to the route. In addition to serving business travellers, Mr Tams said the service also encouraged tourism between the countries, as British holidaymakers now have a direct route to Chengdu and can experience the rich culture of China and its national treasure, the giant panda. “I’ve been to Chengdu many times and I’m a big fan of Sichuan hot pot. I love spicy food so I feel very much at home,” he said, adding that he knew the city well and would recommend it as a place to visit. BA also provides a cargo service between Chengdu and Britain through its sister airline, Iberia, and its partnership with American Airlines. All aboard: London?s Heathrow Express rail-air link was temporarily renamed \"Chengdu 72 Express\" last year as part of a campaign to promote trade links between Britain and Chengdu Mr Tams said businesses in the Chinese city can gain easy access to key consumer markets by using the airline’s extensive network in Europe, North America and Latin America. Mark Bancroft, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, said the Chengdu-London route had shortened the journey by four to five hours, offering a more-convenient option for businesspeople and holidaymakers. He has lived in Chengdu for five years and is married to a native of the city. He said the Sichuan provincial capital was unique compared with many other cities. “The weather is fine, the roads are clean and the people here are very nice… I enjoy living here very much.” Mr Bancroft said there was great co-operative potential between Chengdu and Britain, especially in fields such as transport, health care, architecture and energy. Chengdu, an economic hub in western China, has become one of the country’s most dynamic cities thanks to the central government’s go-west campaign and its opening up to the outside world. The city is home to 268 Fortune Global 500 companies and its economic growth has consistently taken the lead nationwide. GDP passed 1 trillion yuan (£101.3bn) last year, 8.9 per cent higher than in 2013, while foreign direct investment was $10 billion (£6.4bn). Chengdu has gained more international influence as it has expanded co-operation and communication with Britain and other countries in investment, trade, art and education. Fifteen countries have established or gained approval to establish consulates here, the largest number in western China, and it has 28 sister cities worldwide. Longquanyi district in the east of the city has become a production base for FAW-Volkswagen, FAW Toyota, Volvo and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group During an official visit to China in 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron made Chengdu his last stop. He played table tennis at a primary school, tasted Sichuan hot pot and enjoyed Chengdu tea at the thatched cottage of Du Fu, a poet during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Mr Cameron said he was impressed by the picturesque landscape and rapid economic development and could see the future of western China in Chengdu. In July last year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel chose Chengdu as the first stop of her seventh official trip to China. She visited the FAW-Volkswagen factory, took a class in Sichuan cookery and attended a forum on urbanisation. Through co-operation with European companies including Germany ’s Koelnmesse and Britain’s Reed Exhibitions and UBM Group, Chengdu is striving to become a world-class centre for conventions and exhibitions. The city signed an agreement with UBM, the world’s second largest exhibition company, during the third Beijing Fair for Trade in Services in May last year. “Our goal is to work closely with Chengdu to determine the best types of exhibition and resources for both parties to build world-class exhibition events,” said Philip Chapnick, group chief representative of UBM China. The company selected the city to stage the 22nd World Route Development Forum, the biggest annual event for the civil aviation sector, in September next year. One of the most recent events held in Chengdu was the fifth International Festival of Intangible Cultural Heritage in September. Sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, the Sichuan provincial government and Unesco, organisers said the 10-day biennial event was the biggest of its kind, showcasing more than 400 intangible cultural heritage items from 65 countries and regions over more than 59,700 square yards. With its fast development and good location, Chengdu has plans to play a vital role in co-operation and exchanges between China and Europe and has prioritised developing its transportation systems to become a gateway between the two. Chengdu was selected by the UBM Group as the host city of the 22nd World Route Development Forum, an important annual event for the aviation sector, to be held in Sept 2016 Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport is the largest hub in central and western China with more than 80 international routes to destinations including London, Frankfurt, Moscow, San Francisco and Melbourne. A non-stop route from Chengdu to Paris is expected to open in October. The airport handled 37.5 million passengers last year, making it among the busiest airports on the Chinese mainland. The figure has been rising fast and was forecast to reach more than 40 million this year. Construction on a second airport has been scheduled to start this year, making Chengdu the third city on the mainland to have two civil airports after Beijing and Shanghai. The city also opened an express railway to Europe in April 2013 in accordance with China’s national Belt and Road Initiative. The weekly service departs from Chengdu Railway Container Logistics Centre and heads to Lodz, Poland. The train transports laptops, iPads, auto parts, home appliances, clothing, shoes and toys produced in Chengdu and other Chinese cities. It takes about 10 days for the cargo to reach Lodz. Then within three days the shipments can be delivered to customers in London, Paris, Berlin or Rome via Europe’s rail and road networks. The express rail started a return service in late August carrying 41 carriages of food and beverages from Europe to Chengdu. • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:05:38.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
