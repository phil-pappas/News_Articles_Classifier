Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Others say the landmark focuses too much on the battle that eventually gave way to Texas independence and not enough on its role as a cultural and commercial gateway.\n\"We've overly focused on March 6, 1836,\" said Jesus F. de la Teja, director of the Center for the Study of the Southwest at Texas State University.\nSome critics say the Alamo could learn from neighbouring attractions and offer catchier exhibits and displays.\n\"History in and of itself will not sell,\" said Davis Phillips, president and CEO of Phillips Entertainment. \"History, presented in the right way, can sell.\"\nPhillips owns three Alamo Plaza attractions including Ripley's and Guinness World Records Museum. The Texas General Land Office is moving to acquire the buildings housing those businesses across from the Alamo and possibly incorporate them into the mission's original footprint.\nPhillips' ventures and other plaza businesses presumably would be relocated and the buildings used for other purposes, such as a museum with more than 200 artifacts donated by musician and Alamo aficionado Phil Collins.\nState lawmakers have approved spending $31 million for repurposing the site. San Antonio officials have OK'd spending $17 million. But both state and city officials say private donations could raise the tally by hundreds of millions of dollars.\nPhillips said neighbouring family entertainment attractions that complement the Alamo experience should be included in the vision behind the changes. He said most visitors only spend a short time at the mission before heading to nearby businesses.\n\"There's been 170 years of development in the area,\" he said. \"What I'm trying to tell everybody is that San Antonio is the No. 1 destination for leisure (in Texas) so let's be careful to not harm that.\"\nThe Daughters of the Republic of Texas managed the Alamo grounds for more than a century before the state took over the operations earlier this year. The Daughters of the Republic still maintains a research centre there that includes a 38,000-item archival collection considered one of the most important in the state.\nDaughters of the Republic president general Betty Edwards said any Alamo-related changes must be done with \"reverence and respect\" given its history as a burial site for Native Americans and the place where the bodies of the defenders of 1836 were piled and burned by Santa Anna's troops.\nEdwards supports restoring the original footprint, but said a hotel, courthouse and other buildings encroach on that plan.\n\"We can combine entertainment with history without being Disneyland,\" she said.\nShe said a long-running dispute between her organization and the state, including an ongoing civil lawsuit over ownership of artifacts in the collection, has led to discussions with Texas A&M-San Antonio about moving the collection there.\nSan Antonio Conservation Society board member Sue Ann Pemberton said an Alamo alteration must include explanations about early settlements in the region, how commerce grew and the development that followed.\n\"The key issue is that we haven't told the story of that mission very well,\" she said.\nDe la Teja said the Alamo has been turned into a \"living ruin\" that doesn't capture the dynamic rise of the area in which many cultures built an important commercial hub over time.\n\"San Antonio grew up around it, so let's tell that story,\" he said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:22:19.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
