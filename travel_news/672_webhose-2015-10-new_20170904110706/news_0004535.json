Come Thursday night, they are also staying at a hotel that has won one of the Historic Hotels of America's 2015 Awards of Excellence , which were announced Thursday evening. A program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Historic Hotels of America will accept only member hotels that have been designated by the U.S. secretary of the interior as a National Historic Landmark or that are listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The hotels also have to be recognized as having historic significance and be at least 50 years old. The National Trust founded the group with 32 charter members in 1989, and it now has more than 260 historic hotel members in 44 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The members are mostly (but not all) independently owned properties.
