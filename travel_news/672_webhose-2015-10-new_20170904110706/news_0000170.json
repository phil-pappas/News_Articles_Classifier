The average tenure for these contract employees was roughly six weeks. The Airport’s program established training, equipment, and compensation and benefits standards for airlines and service providers whose employees perform services impacting safety and security at SFO. Over the years, airlines have increased the contracting out of safety and security-sensitive functions, and the importance of the QSP to maintain high standards of safety and security has only grown.\nWhen it first launched, the QSP covered a combined 1,700 employees. With this latest revision, the QSP will apply to 12,500 employees. Independent third-party studies have confirmed that QSP, specifically the wage component, has decreased the turnover rate and increased effort and performance for covered employees.\n“I am grateful to the Airport Commission for approving this revision to our Quality Standards Program,” said Airport Director John L. Martin. “Since its creation in 1999, this program has proven effective in reducing high employee turnover, while improving training standards for employees at SFO. The QSP reflects my belief that the entire employee community at SFO must work together to provide the highest level of safety and security. This community is comprised of airlines, the many airline service providers, and thousands of employees working collectively to continually enhance safety and security for the 48 million annual passengers we serve at SFO.”\nUnder the revision approved today by the Airport Commission, airline catering staff will be eligible for wage and benefits levels commensurate with employees who perform safety and security functions, which currently include airline ground workers, baggage handlers, and service providers such as wheelchair operators.\nThis latest revision also requires that all employees covered under the QSP receive at least the minimum established compensation amount regardless of whether they are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Previously, such CBAs could take precedence over the QSP compensation and benefits requirements.\nThe QSP requires companies to pay covered employees a minimum wage rate of $0.50 per hour higher than that provided under the San Francisco Minimum Compensation Ordinance, and to comply with San Francisco’s Health Care Accountability Ordinance.\nIn the coming months, additional revisions will be made to the QSP to further enhance safety and security training requirements and performance standards for airline service providers at SFO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:03:11.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
