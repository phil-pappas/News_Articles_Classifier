Who needs fries or chips when you can snack on these marvelous soup dumplings for a dollar or two?\nThe sight of chicken broth and pork wobbling inside a paper-thin wrapper -- assuming a chopstick hasn't accidentally pierced the tender skin -- is sheer heaven for many locals.\nThe most famous place for the dish is Yinshi Jishi Tangbao restaurant, though the flavor can be too sweet for some.\nIf you prefer your dumplings more savory, Liu Changxing restaurant is recommended.\nBest at:\nLiu Changxing, 506 Zhongshan Dong Lu, Baixia District; +86 25 8441 1031\nMORE: Nanjing mini-guide\nSweet and sour Mandarin fish\nSweet and sour Mandarin fish is perhaps the quintessential example of Jinling cuisine (a subset of Jiangsu cuisine, typical of Nanjing).\nThe preparation requires delicate skill, and there's an emphasis on appearance as well as taste.\nThe fish is de-boned and the flesh sliced in a grid pattern so that it fans out. The head and tail are left on.\nIt then goes in the wok. Ingredients such as shrimp, nuts and mushrooms are added to boiling sweet and sour sauce and poured over the fish, creating a squeaking sound.\nThe result is a plate of fish shaped like a squirrel, hence its common name, \"squirrel fish.\"\nBest at:\nMaXiangXing CaiGuan , YunNan North Road 32, Nanjing China; +86 25 8328 6387/6388; 6:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m.\nDuck blood vermicelli soup\nYes, the soup is made of duck-blood curd and offal -- but that doesn't deter local connoisseurs.\nIt's said that duck blood vermicelli soup was brought to Nanjing by a traveler from Auhui, a neighboring province.\nBut the dish has become a favorite Nanjinger cheap eat.\nYou can find duck blood vermicelli soup as easily in Nanjing as you can find kebab stands in Berlin.\nBest at:\nYadebao, 11-12 Chaozhi Xiang, Baixia District; +86 25 8452 4820\nJinling roast duck\nThere's a never-ending debate about where roast duck was invented -- it's called Peking duck in Beijing and Jinling duck in Nanjing.\nAccording to one legend, Ming Dynasty emperor Zhu Di brought his favorite roasted-duck chefs with him from his Nanjing palace when he moved the capital to Beijing.\nThough less celebrated internationally, Jinling duck is hardly inferior to its northern counterpart. Crisp and greasy duck skin with juicy and tender flesh is the standard formula of this satisfying dish.\nBest at:\nChen Lin, 5-1 Diao Yu Tai (Near Zhonghua Gate)\nMORE: City of emperors: Why Nanjing's beauty still resonates in China\nHairy crab\nPull the legs and claws off before prising open the shell. Since 2001, the biggest event in Gaochun County in southern Nanjing has been the annual hairy crab festival.\nThis makes sense -- about a third of the county's area is occupied by Gucheng Lake, one of the country's top breeding grounds for hairy crabs.\nThe crabs are meaty and sweet, with a paste inside that has a rich, buttery texture.\nThe best season for hairy crab is fall.\nChinese believe that the ninth month of the lunar calendar (usually mid-September) is the best time for female hairy crabs and the tenth month (mid-October) is best for male hairy crabs.\nBest in:\nGaochun county in mid- to late September\nEgg shaomai\nIt's the most expensive shaomai in Nanjing, but it's the best.\nMa Xiang Xing Halal restaurant reinvented the shaomai dumpling for a Chinese general who loved shaomai and loved shrimp.\nTypical shaomai uses pork, fish or cheaper bits of shrimp -- at Ma Xiang Xing Halal, fresh shrimp are made into a paste and wrapped in a thin dumpling made from egg.\nThese aren't to be mistaken for the egg yolk shaomai sold on the ground floor in Ma Xiang Xing.\nBest at:\nMaXiangXing CaiGuan , YunNan North Road 32, Nanjing China; +86 25 8328 6387/6388; 6:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m.\nREAD: An architectural wonderland hidden in a Chinese forest", "external_links": ["http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294220-d6579270-Reviews-m14631-Jinling_Hotel_Plum_Garden-Nanjing_Jiangsu.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152827-crabs-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152410-dsc-0075-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152827-crabs-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152827-crabs-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152827-crabs-small-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294220-d3401229-Reviews-m14631-MaXiangXing_CaiGuan-Nanjing_Jiangsu.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152410-dsc-0075-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152410-dsc-0075-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152410-dsc-0075-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152410-dsc-0075-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152410-dsc-0075-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152827-crabs-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152827-crabs-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294220-d3402421-Reviews-m14631-LiJi_QingZhenGuan-Nanjing_Jiangsu.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152410-dsc-0075-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019152827-crabs-small-11.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:30:35.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
