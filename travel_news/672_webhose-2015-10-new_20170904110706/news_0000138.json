Rescue work is underway and workers have scored the water to look for survivors. The Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre has said that it is not yet clear as how many tourists have survived.\nHowever according to local news sources 21 have been rescued, while one person remains missing. 18 were sent to hospital.\nThe boat is a whale watching vessel called the Leviathan II. Witnesses have told the local media that the boat sank far enough from the shore and could not be seen. The water was not choppy so the reason for the boat to sink is not known yet. Weather conditions were moderate, with cloud, some wind and light rain. However the waters on the west side of Vargas Island can be unpredictable said local sources.\nJohn Forde, who owns the Tofino Whale Centre and is a captain at the local fire department, said that the boat was close to the rocks and you could still see part of the vessel above water.\nMilitary help is being sought for rescue operations. A military helicopter and a fixed wing aircraft will join in the search. Two Canadian Coast Guard vessels have been deployed to Tofino, as well as other vessels.\nThe Canadian Coast Guard, local water taxi companies, the Ahousaht First Nation and other private vessels are all helping in the search.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:45:09.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
