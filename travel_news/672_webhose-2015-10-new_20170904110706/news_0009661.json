The first thing a visitor should do in Addis is have coffee made traditionally in a jebena jug at a tin-roofed street stall – they are all over the place. The new wealth in the city means there’s an emerging cafe culture, but I prefer the well-known Tomoca Coffee Shop . It’s in the Piazza neighbourhood and is where my parents used to go on dates. It was groovy in the 1960s; now it’s a nostalgic old place.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Film director Yared Zeleke.

It’s a working-class area and, like the rest of the city, is very integrated economically, ethnically and religiously. For Christmas we’d invite our Muslim neighbours to our house, and at Eid they’d invite us.\nThe city’s cool climate allows for beautiful and varied vegetation – hence Addis Ababa, or “new flower”. You can imagine Empress Taytu Betul arriving here 130 years ago, seeing this land of mountainous valleys and lush terrain and naming it that. It’s heartbreaking to see the gardens and parks, my favourite parts of the city, now being destroyed by high-rises and highways. It was pretty magical when I grew up here – so lush and colourful.\nAddis is a great place to eat if you’re vegetarian or vegan . Many dishes have developed over the centuries to cater for Orthodox Christians during their many fasting periods. The closest thing you’ll find to Ethiopian home cooking in a restaurant is the misser – a lentil dish with butter and egg – at the Asni Gallery restaurant in the Arat Kilo area.\nEthiopian food has a distinct flavour. It’s not typical African food, and it’s not Middle Eastern, either. It’s closer to Indian, but we don’t have curry. We have a mixed spice called berbere , which has loads of different ingredients. It’s hard to describe it so you have to taste it, maybe in our chicken stew, doro wat . Try it at Yod Abyssinia restaurant in the Sar Bet neighbourhood – it’s touristy, but still good.\nTomoca cafe in Addis Ababa. Photograph: Alamy There are great views from Mount Entonto. It’s a 3,200m peak to the north-east of the city, and it was from here that the Ethiopian royal family first laid eyes on Addis in the 19th century.\nThe best place to party is Fendika . A classic azmari bar, serving honey-wine ( tej ), it’s owned by dancer Melaku Belay and, as well as showing traditional eskista dancing, it promotes local musicians so you might see a serious band singing to the krar and masinko instruments. There’s also a great, cheap dive bar in Piazza by the Taitu hotel. It’s friendly and plays all types of Ethiopian music. \nUniveristy park.

You might hear Mulatu Astatke, or try Jazz Amba for big names such as Alemayehu Eshete, or Oh Canada to hear my DJ friends Mitmita & Akilas.\nSome say Addis is becoming a cheap version of Dubai. I’m not keen on the new skyscrapers; I hope the city can save its soul.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Drinking tej , a traditional fermented honey drink. Photograph: reportage / Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy \nThis part of the country wasn’t occupied. But Italians came and lived in the Piazza neighbourhood. It’s a great area with a few Italian buildings remaining and fantastic pastry shops. If you’re staying in the city, the two old-school hotels I’d recommend are in this area: Ghion , a former palace, and Taitu , Ethiopia’s first hotel, built in 1898.\n• Yared Zeleke’s film Lamb has been nominated for the Sutherland Award for directorial debut at the BFI London Film Festival , which starts on Wednesday \n• Trekking in Ethiopia at Christmas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:51:51.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
