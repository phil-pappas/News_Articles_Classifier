He’d drive over on a Saturday morning when the rest of us were going on the team bus and he'd go all over the country taking Cian to games and following every single match. Don will be at all Rugby World Cup 2015 games. Family support is deeply important to Cian, especially at this time. When I started my career as a mixed martial artist in the UFC, my victory celebrations after a fight wouldn’t begin until I'd seen my family. And that’s how it’ll be for Cian, who says: “These people have my best interests at heart and I'm surrounded by them now. The fight is over and the celebration can start.” Cian's face is plastered across the buses here in Dublin. He's a very, very popular figure here You make a lot of sacrifices when you're a high-level athlete trying to succeed in your sport. You take yourself away from family and friends and want to be left alone. It's not an easy thing to do. I believe everybody is a product of their family. I wouldn't be where I am today, doing what I'm doing if it wasn't for them. It’s a great feeling to return to them and that's what you look forward to during camp. I don't believe Cian would be where he is today either if it wasn't for his family. Anyone who ever went to the Healy house was treated so well. They'd fix you food and look after you. They were really welcoming. They were just as supportive to all Cian’s schoolmates. His dad always offered us encouragement at games. He wasn't just there for his son. You’ll never beat the Irish Right now, Cian's face is plastered across the sides of the buses here in Dublin. He's a very, very popular figure here. It gives you an extra bit of gas in the tank when you hear that support from your countrymen, and Irish support is second to none. You always hear them playing You'll Never Beat the Irish at sporting events. The Irish athletes feed off it. It gives them an extra edge. The last game against Romania wouldn't have been seen as a big clash between two big teams, but the crowd lifted the occasion. There were nearly 90,000 at Wembley, a record crowd for a rugby game. The Irish turned out in force and raised the roof. Incredible. Forward march: Cian is set to push on in Rugby World Cup 2015 Photo: Getty I've experienced it myself. At a Dublin UFC event last year, I was in a really hard fight and had to come back from the brink and had that kind of support from the fans. Cian was there too, by the way. When I was down and out there, I had some extra pride because I knew the fans were cheering for me. The last thing you want to do is lose in front of your proud countrymen and I used that to turn the fight around. Taking on Italy and France I think the way the scheduling worked out has been absolutely perfect for Ireland so far. They had the easier games at the start of the campaign to settle the nerves and just get the ball rolling but the competition increases now. Italy will be a really tough test this weekend. I was amazed by the performance against Romania, and what Cian did in the game. That was the first game he's started since his neck injury in May, just four months ago. To see him come out and play his first competitive game like that and carry the ball the way he did up through the middle of the field and gain hard yards was great. I know myself, the most important thing is the confidence in your body. You only get it by taking it out for a test drive after injury. In the back of your head, you're worried and you're subconsciously protecting it, but that goes away when you start putting your body on the line in a competitive situation. This will bring out the best in him now. He's passed his first test with flying colours, he'll have put the injury woes to the back of his mind and he can now push on from here. Roll on the next victory for Cian and Ireland. • Now read Cathal's first blog: 'My friend Cian Healy is a freak of nature' • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:45:55.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
