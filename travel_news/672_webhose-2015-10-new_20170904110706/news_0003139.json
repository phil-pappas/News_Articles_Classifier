In our case, we promoted our beaches as well but more importantly, we promoted everything else that makes Seychelles unique, different, and stand out from all our competitors. \n“Seychelles has so much more to offer than the ultimate sun, sand, and sea holiday, and it always gives us great satisfaction to tell potential clients and visitors what they can do on a holiday in Seychelles, besides lounging in the sun on the beach,” she said. \nMrs. Hoareau said that there were queries on both high-end hotels and the more affordable options, which she said gave them the opportunity to create awareness on the different accommodation options available. \nShe continued that having direct flights between Seychelles and Dar was also a strong selling point during their promotion and interested many people. \n“The fact that Air Seychelles has direct flights to Dar and it is barely two-and-a-half-hours away, was a big plus for us and Air Seychelles. It proved that we were very much accessible and only a stone’s throw away.” \nMrs. Hoareau thanked the Air Seychelles team in Dar for their support at the fair and also the Seychelles’ Honorary Consul in Tanzania, Maryvonne Pool, for her assistance and continued support towards the work of the Seychelles Tourism Board. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
