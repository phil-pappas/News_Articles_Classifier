The event, which welcomed over 4,000 participants from 129 countries last week, brought together an impressive line-up of top-level government representatives, leaders of the ICT industry. \nThe bid proposal for the congress by the Hungarian Government was prepared with the professional support of HUNGEXPO last year and the result was announced at the ITU Telecom World 2014 in Doha. Hungary won against Hong Kong to host the event in 2015. The congress occupied altogether 35.000 sqm space at HUNGEXPO, the largest multifunctional event venue of Hungary. The exhibition took place in the interconnecting Hall G and F on 13.000 sqm while the conference was held in the 20.000 sqm Hall A, the largest hall of the venue. Here 11 temporary rooms were built for the event ranging from 200 sqm to 900 sqm in size. For HUNGEXPO the main challenge was to provide the essential separated spaces, since the event halls do not have any pre-built breakout rooms. HUNGEXPO used this flexibility to the conference benefit, resulting the most efficient flow of the congress by providing the best variation and set ups of the session rooms. The rooms were built from a special sound proof panel structure which got already tested during previous international events as well, thus it was possible to schedule parallel sessions in all of the 11 rooms without having any interference. The new panel system now allows HUNGEXPO to build rooms between 50 and 1000 m2 in a highly cost efficient and competitive manner. They believe that this new, innovative and flexible solution will attract the attention of event professionals worldwide, and consequently more and more international congress and exhibition organisers will choose the multifunctional spaces of HUNGEXPO, and Budapest, a trending MICE destination of Europe for their event. The other challenge the venue was facing was the fact that the event - arising from its nature – had a huge need of seamless internet access at all times. Taking into consideration that the participants were coming from the field of IT it was expected that they will bring multiple gadgets which need to be connected to the internet. For this reason HUNGEXPO, although had a wireless system build already, decided to invest in the development of such a system which is able to serve these needs. During the event altogether 3620 different devices were connected to the WIFI (1/1 Gbps bandwidth) without any problem, thus it can be concluded that the investment was successful and will be an advantageous asset for future events as well. “ITU 2015 was one of the largest congresses and exhibitions that was ever held at Hungexpo. We coordinated the event both with ITU in Geneva and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on behalf of the Hungarian Government. To host and organize a congress for 4000 is a challenge itself: the logistics, match the exhibition requirements the very high level IT requirements of the event not to mention managing the high-level politicians and VIPs attending. I am very proud of the team behind the event. It was not only a great opportunity for HUNGEXPO to show its competence for organising such large-scale events, but it has contributed to the Budapest’s boosting tourism by generating about 12.000 guest nights and additional spending.” said Anita Kristóf, the Director of Event Sales at HUNGEXPO. The exhibition consisted of numerous National Pavilions (Argentina, Azerbaijan, China, Djibouti, Hungary, Japan, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Gabon), stands of leading IT companies (Airtel, Alibaba, ATDI, China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, Ericsson, Etisalat Nigeria, GEW Technologies, Fujitsu, Huawei, Intel, KT, LS telcom, Magyar Telekom, Microwave Vision Group, Rohde and Schwarz, Sonatel-Orange, TDIA, UPC and ZTE) and function spaces (Innovation Space, Media Space, Smart ICTs for Sustainable Development) resulting in a rather enthralling show floor. HUNGEXPO was not only hosting the event, but provided a 360 degree scope of services such as the building of 2000 m2 exhibition space, used 10 km cable for internet, over 2 km truss and curtain, thus fulfilled its task as the PEO of the ITU Telecom World 2015 at the highest level.
