How to even emphasize this kind of luxury with excellent service and the highest standards of comfort and elegance is being demonstrated by the private island Veela in the Maldives and the shipping company PONANT Yacht Cruises & Expeditions in the next year during the luxury tourism fair loop in Frankfurt, Germany. Find out about loop at www.loop-luxury-fair.com \nVelaa Private Island is the realisation of a dream to create a ‘beyond luxury’ ultra-exclusive boutique hideaway. This unique destination was developed to embody the very best of this unique archipelago, bathed by azure skies in the aquamarine waters of the Indian Ocean. The name of this private retreat, an elegant fusion of Maldivian culture with contemporary luxury, means “Turtle Island” in the local language – named after generations of sea turtles that have migrated here to nest and hatch. Velaa Private Island has been designed and curated with privacy and comfort as the guiding principles while allowing the Indian Ocean to take center stage. At one with nature, each of the private retreats is built using local materials, combining contemporary flourishes with interiors designed for sensory exploration. Generous terraces and sultry gazebos are positioned to maximise shade, breeze, views and privacy, allowing for total immersion in nature. The resort comprises 43 private villas, houses and residences and 4 four-bedroom residences. 18 villas are built over water, including the Romantic Pool Residence which can only be reached by boat, allowing even more privacy and exclusivity.
