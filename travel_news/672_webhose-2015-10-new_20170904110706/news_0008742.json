Funds2Orgs helps organizations and individuals to raise funds through shoe drive fundraisers, paying them based on the total weight of the shoes collected. The drive garnered mass support from 13 states with 130 drop off and pick up locations, allowing Andrew's family to raise more than $30,000 .\nAndrew, age 20, suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and regular doctor visits are necessary to monitor his health. Andrew cannot travel without reliable and safe transportation. With the cost of a wheelchair accessible van easily reaching upwards of $30,000 , Andrew's family brainstormed ideas on ways they could raise funds. Then, they happened upon the Funds2Orgs website. The relationship between Shoe Me the Love/Andrew's Van Fund and Fund2Orgs proved to be an enormous success because it was an easy and engaging fundraiser to execute, particularly because a shoe drive doesn't involve any selling or asking for money. Overall, families and communities were happy to support the cause of this innovative fundraiser, because almost everyone has at least one extra pair of shoes they no longer use.\n\"Andrew and his family are now special members of our extended family. They worked so hard to promote the shoe drive for Andrew,\" said Tom Henderson , Chief Fundraising Officer of Funds2Orgs , \"Our entire team was thrilled to be part of a campaign that's making an important difference in someone's life.\"\nAbout Funds2Orgs\nFunds2Orgs is the shoe drive fundraiser that keeps on giving. Not only do organizations raise funds for their cause, the shoes collected are distributed to impoverished families in micro-enterprise businesses in 26 developing nations to help them find a path out of poverty.
