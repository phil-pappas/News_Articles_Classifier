A little warm and humid, but it made the mojitos that much more refreshing and taxi rides in 1950s Chevy convertibles a lot of fun! Going on this well-run tour enabled us to see and experience many things off the beaten path of your average tourist, and helped us gain a better understanding of the history -- from their perspective -- and culture of Cuba and its people. Plus, with relations now improving between the U.S. and Cuba, we wanted to experience it as it is today, with little or no influence from the U.S. for the past 50+ years.\" Share your travels with us!
