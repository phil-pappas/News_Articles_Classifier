Missouri law requires insurance agents to include Uninsured Motorist Coverages in auto insurance policy contracts. Uninsured Motorist Coverage protects consumers against drivers who do not have adequate auto insurance.

Alternatives Insurance of St Louis City concentrates on solving issues related to auto insurance coverages. Understanding the various auto insurance coverages in Missouri could be the difference between protecting one’s assets and experiencing financial loss, or lost wages if one is unable to work due to an accident that results in extensive damages. The Missouri Auto Insurance Education Series explains how Uninsured Motorist Coverage protects the consumer. Choosing the right Uninsured Motorist Coverage with an auto insurance policy that fits the needs of the consumer is crucial; the Missouri Auto Insurance Education Series provides the basics for consumers to get a head start before consulting with an agent. Missouri Auto Insurance Education – Series, part 2 – provides information about Missouri Auto Insurance policies, the different types of protection for drivers, insurance laws, state regulations, how premiums are calculated, which deductible meets the consumer budget, and clarifications of the different insurance coverages, including bodily injury liability, property damage liability, uninsured/underinsured motorist, medical insurance coverages, and more. Consumers must know Missouri Auto Insurance Uninsured Motorist Coverage offers coverage for bodily injury and can offer coverage for damages to the vehicle. In addition to injuries to the driver, the bodily injury portion of Uninsured Motorist Coverage may also cover injuries to passengers or family members who are driving the vehicle at the time of such a crash. The coverage limits for Uninsured Motorist Coverage protection can range from $20,000 to $1 million. Missouri Auto Insurance Uninsured Motorist Coverage also covers insured damages to a vehicle that was parked and not occupied when the at-fault party is unknown. Missouri Auto Insurance Uninsured Motorist Coverage is especially important for Motorcycle drivers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a motorcycle rider is more likely to suffer serious injury or death from an accident than occupants in a passenger car. The NHTSA also states that the motorcyclist is rarely at fault when involved in an accident. Additionally, the Insurance Research Council (IRC) 2014 study estimates about 1 in every 7 drivers in the U.S. are uninsured. This number is equivalent to 13.8 percent of all motorists. In Missouri, about 14 percent of all drivers lack sufficient auto insurance coverage. This estimated number of uninsured motorists was based on insurance claims, using a ratio of insurance claims made by people who were injured by uninsured drivers relative to the claims made by people who were injured by insured drivers.
