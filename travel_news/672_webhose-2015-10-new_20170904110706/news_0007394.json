All three of our companies have plenty of snow-sure resorts to choose from and, in many cases, altitude also provides the opportunity to ski to and from your own chalet or hotel doorstep.\"For examples of early season discounts at high-altitude resorts, Inghams has a week in Serre Chevalier in France at a three-diamond chalet from £499 per person, a saving of £360, departing on December 19; Esprit Ski has a week in a chalet in Les Arc 2000 from £1,999 for a family a four, a saving of £1,464, departing on December 20, and Ski Total has a week in snow-sure Tignes from £669 per person, departing on December 20, also staying in a chalet. \nWednesday, October 14, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:03:31.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
