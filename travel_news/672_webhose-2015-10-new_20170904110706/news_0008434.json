IPEX, which was originally launched in 1851, was hosted in London in 2014 and has previously taken place every four years. The new look event will take place triennially, with the first show set to be held at Birmingham’s NEC in autumn 2017. \nCommenting on the news, Kathryn James, Managing Director of the NEC, said: “This innovative partnership between Informa, Picon and the NEC will deliver a show that not only meets the needs of the print industry in 2017 and beyond but also sets an agenda for the future of this sector.” As part of the IPEX 2017 Joint Executive Committee (JEC), the NEC will help to develop various aspects of the show, including the exhibitor and visitor experience. Kathryn continued: “We have 40 years’ experience in the event industry and are always looking for new ways to enhance the experience of visitors to our venue. We aim to use this unbeatable insight and experience to help Informa and Picon deliver a great show.” Peter Hall, Managing Director of Informa Exhibitions, said: “We are fully committed to IPEX and taking a whole new fresh and collaborative approach to designing the IPEX of the future. We recognize that several aspects of IPEX 2014 were not successful but we have learned from these and will consult closely with the market to ensure that IPEX 2017 is a UK focussed, industry-driven event that appeals strongly to exhibitors and visitors. He continued: “IPEX is the UK print industry’s flagship event with a superb heritage. I am confident that our considerable investment, alongside our partnership with Picon and the NEC, and close collaboration with the UK industry as a whole, will help make IPEX 2017 the best showcase for the latest print technology and innovation.” Bettine Pellant, CEO, Picon, said: “There is a strong appetite from UK suppliers, manufacturers and visitors for a major event every three years, which keeps pace with the speed of change in the industry, does not conflict with drupa and very much complements a variety of annual UK signage, packaging and print shows. Picon represents manufacturers and suppliers to the UK printing, papermaking and converting sectors and all will benefit from a vibrant IPEX.
