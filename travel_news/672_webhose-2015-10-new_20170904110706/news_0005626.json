Kennedy (JFK) International Airport on Nov. 23, 2015.\nThe updated arrival date and additional capacity for A380 service comes in response to strong demand from Etihad Airways guests who are traveling during the U.S.’s busy Thanksgiving holiday, as well as to attend the 2015 Formula 1 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix taking place Nov. 27-29. The new service was originally scheduled to begin on Dec. 1, 2015 and will replace one of the existing Boeing 777 services.\nEtihad President and Chief Executive Officer James Hogan said: “Etihad Airways is committed to reimagining the travel experience to offer the ultimate in luxury, comfort and service for our guests. The overwhelmingly positive response we have received to our A380 service on our Abu Dhabi to London and Sydney routes, as well as for our upcoming launch to New York has exceeded our expectations. With the early introduction of our A380 service into New York, we look forward to further redefining what world-class air travel can be for our guests traveling on Etihad Airways across all classes of service.”\nFrom the moment they begin their journey, guests in The Residence by Etihad enjoy the ultimate in luxury: a chauffeur-driven ride to the airport; up to two guests on board will experience a private three-room suite that includes a living room, a double bedroom, and a separate ensuite shower room. Guests also have access to the Etihad Lifestyle Concierge team, which works closely with the airline’s in-flight, Savoy-trained butlers to deliver highly personalized service both on the ground and in the air, including dining reservations, entertainment bookings, special events, destination information and lifestyle services.\nSource:-Etihad Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:55:10.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
