Fall, with its turning leaves and beckoning trails, is prime time for the region, as an eager new wave of travelers is discovering for themselves. Now even Onefinestay , a British startup that rents the sort of impeccably designed pieds-à-terre (and five-story brownstones) that would make HGTV enthusiast Hillary Clinton swoon, is getting out of town, having put together a small portfolio of handpicked upstate homes .\nWinding past Bear Mountain and up through the Catskills toward Albany, the Hudson Valley is an expansive area, one that, over the years, has played host to Rockefellers, Roosevelts, Joan Rivers, and one headless horseman. Frank Lloyd Wright–apprentice Edgar Tafel designed and lived in East Point , a mid-century modern dream available on Onefinestay, whose floor-to-ceiling windows look out to a sunken pool and cliffs in the distance. The company’s cofounder, Evan Frank, is partial to Mettacahonts Creek in Kerhonkson, which, with its pink sofa and gleaming subway tiles, is a true credit to “cabin chic.” More rural still is York Lake House ; General manager of new markets Alex Rethore, calls the Catskills abode “all sunshine and glass.”\nThese retreats, perfect for entertaining, could make one forget about the myriad attractions just past the front porch, from hiking to canoeing to apple- and pumpkin-picking at any number of farms. Rethore recommends Tivoli’s Mead Orchards —Onefinestay reps are always on hand should guests require tips for wine in Woodstock ( Woodstock Wine and Liquors ) or antiques in Andes ( Kabinett & Kammer ). Increasingly, though, the quest is for a table at the latest hip restaurant. Gaskins , a Germantown tavern that owners Nick and Sarah Suarez—formerly of Brooklyn and, more specifically, Diner, Franny’s, and Roman’s—painted a denim blue, more than qualifies. It’s farm-to-table, of course, but don’t roll your eyes until you’ve tried the fried green tomatoes or house-made fettuccine with rabbit ragù. Dessert people, meanwhile, head to Upper Hudson for Verdigris Tea & Chocolate Bar . Happily, Onefinestay likes to make the most of these local gems, so rather than a single chocolate on your pillow, you might find a whole artisanal bar of it by the door.", "external_links": ["http://www.verdigristea.com/", "http://www.onefinestay.com/", "http://gaskinsny.com/", "http://www.onefinestay.com/hudson-valley/east-point/", "http://www.woodstockwineandliquors.com/", "http://www.onefinestay.com/hudson-valley/york-lake-house/", "http://www.onefinestay.com/search/?city=545&cityCode=HUD", "http://www.onefinestay.com/hudson-valley/mettacahonts-creek/", "http://www.meadorchards.com/", "http://kabinettandkammer.com/"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:16:03.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
