This may be the case in Tanzania after the general elections in that country on October 25. \nAchievements by the Ministry of Natural Resources & Tourism in Dar-Es-Salam has made an commendable job in promoting Tanzanian tourism in recent years, resulting in a huge increase in the number of tourists visiting the country. \nLocal members of the Tanzania Travel and Tourism industry may fear these achievements may be trashed if a joint decision by tour guides, porters, cooks and other supporting staff to go on a three-week long strike immediately after the General Elections on October 25 actually takes place. \nThis was revealed to members of the press in Moshi, Kilimanjaro Region, recently by the Chairman of the Tanzania Tourists Guides Association, (TTGA), Johnson Sadock Johnson. \nAccording to the Association, the challenges facing tour guides, porters and cooks who serve tourists in Tanzania emerged in earnest in 2013. One of the challenges is the need to ensure that tourist guides, porters and cooks are subjected to legally-binding working contracts. \nTTGA tried to have the issues dealt in a different levels of authorities in the government – but all was in vain. \nIt was also planned that a meeting to evaluate the seven resolutions was to be held on October 7 this year – but a day before the meeting the Kilimanjaro Regional Administrative Secretary (RAS) announced the evaluation meeting could not be held because of the lack of funds for the purpose! \nIs the government really caring about tourism? This question is on the mind of tourism leaders in Tanzania these days.
