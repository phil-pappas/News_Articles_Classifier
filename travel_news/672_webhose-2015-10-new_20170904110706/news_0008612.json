As a result, BookLogic is presenting its business case, products and services in order for the industry to become aware of its success since launching its operations in 2009.\nThe company’s headquarters are based in Germany with offices established in Turkey, and in Dubai, UAE during 2015. BookLogic’s client base has been expanding at a considerable rate over the past five years, with an average 80+% year-on-year growth in clients. The technology company now services over 1,500 hotel properties, which include International Comfort Hotels, Fantasia Hotels, D-Resorts, Liberty Hotels, Euphoria Hotels, Senator Hotels Group and Akka Hotels.\nBookLogic has expanded its product portfolio to include the full set of online revenue management tools; including smart booking engine, GDS, IDS and Channel manager. To meet the changing industry, the company complimented this mix by adding marketing and SEO services to improve the performance of hotel websites.\nBookLogic introduced the five-point approach to increase online revenues and direct bookings. As such, ensuring there is an increase in the booking transition rate and conversion rate. This was achieved by increasing the speed of the booking engine and ensuring there is a simple customer checkout process.\nBookLogic found that with greater knowledge of online consumer behaviour and purchase habits it has been able to provide a better product suite supported by consultancy and marketing services. “We looked at other industries to better prepare hotels and facilitate revenue growth across all online channels. By analysing the wider online sales market we have been able to improve the performance of our tools,” said Oral Yigitkus, CEO BookLogic.\nThe business aims to improve the satisfactory benchmark of hotel bookings to push the industry forward in online digital bookings. “The main problem for our customers, and hotels generally, is that the number of visitors just doesn’t profit,” continues Oral.\n“Technology will only work if all aspects of the business are aligned. Our business is like the legs of a table; we first ensure each leg is in place and solid. For this our legs are; online hotel distribution and channel management, simple transactional websites, best booking conversion, SEO and Adwords, and rigorous rate and review analysis of the hotel guests. Once these are aligned, then the hotel can achieve success in online business and direct bookings.”\nBookLogic is focusing on its long-term vision as a technology business and a provider of expert marketing services to the hotel industry. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:42:32.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
