This is the ninth consecutive year that SAA has won the accolade, adding to a line-up of awards the airline received this year including a 4-Star Airline Skytrax ranking for the 13th year in a row. \nSince moving to the new Queen’s Terminal 2 at London Heathrow International Airport in October 2014, SAA has continued its commitment to quality service. On-time departures and consistency is a key requirement for business travel. Since its move into the new terminal, South African Airways average on-time performance for departures has been above 90% exceeding the company’s targets. Receiving the 2015 Business Traveller Award for ‘Best African Airline’ further cements the airline’s growing reputation. The Business Traveller Awards, which were hosted by English writer, broadcaster, actor Gyles Brandreth at London’s Royal Garden Hotel this week, are voted for by readers of the magazine and are designed to reward products and services that the readers themselves value. Widely regarded as the market’s benchmark for excellence, South Africa’s national carrier beat competition from Kenya Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, and Egypt Air. SAA offers direct double daily flights between London Heathrow and Johannesburg and serves over 30 destinations within Africa on a fleet of Airbus A330 and A340s.
