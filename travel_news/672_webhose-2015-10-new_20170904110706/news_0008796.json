After the Sorento made the \"Perfect Getaway\" during the Big Game, the new campaign takes a lighthearted approach to prove Kia's largest CUV is capable of handling anything football families throw at it.\nThe three ad spots – \"Participation,\" \"Great Game\" and \"Pants\" – each focus on a key Sorento feature in addition to real life football situations. By showing the contrast between the way real football parents are expected to act and what's really going on in their heads, Kia executes a humorous campaign that breaks through the football clutter in a way that no other car brand has done.\n\" Participation \" – A father and son walk to their Sorento after an end-of-season ceremony with a participation trophy in hand. We hear the father's inner monologue questioning why an undefeated season by his son's team only deserves a participation trophy. \" Great Game \" – A father loads the last of his son's football equipment into the Sorento's spacious cargo area. Following a congratulatory \"Great game today, Billy,\" from the father, we hear the mother's inner monologue, conveying a very different message about her son's performance on the field. \"Pants\" – A family pulls their Sorento into a completely packed parking lot next to a football field. The husband suggests his wife park far from the field where there are available parking spots, at which point we hear the wife's inner monologue, \"A.W.D. stands for all-wheel drive. Not, asphalt will do. \"Sunday Night Football attracts the largest primetime audience and provides an excellent opportunity to connect with football fans and showcase the premium utility experience of Kia's largest and most capable CUV ever,\" said Tim Chaney , vice president of marketing communications, KMA.\nCreated by David&Goliath, Kia's advertising agency of record, the Sorento spots can be viewed on television during Sunday Night Football broadcasts on NBC. The campaign highlights desirable features of the vehicle, including cargo space, its comfortable cabin and all-wheel drive capabilities.\nAbout the 2016 Kia Sorento\nThe completely redesigned 2016 Sorento CUV, which raises the bar on the segment with its refinement and first-class amenities, is larger and more capable than ever with more room for passengers and cargo. Standard premium features and luxurious amenities span the line of five trim levels and the Sorento is now offered in three engine choices, including a 240 hp 2.0L turbo-charged inline-4. The Sorento is built at the brand's U.S. manufacturing plant* – Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia – in West Point , Georgia.\nAbout Kia Motors America\nKia Motors America (KMA) is the marketing and distribution arm of Kia Motors Corporation based in Seoul , South Korea.
