We initially started hanging out with the intention of collaborating, but clearly it turned into something much bigger!”\nWhen it came time to marry, Caroline and Ian decided to host their event at Snug Harbor, a collection of 19th-century architecturally significant buildings nestled in an 83-acre cultural center and botanical garden on the north shore of Staten Island, New York. “I discovered the location during a video shoot there,” says Caroline. “When we went back to consider it for our wedding, we saw the Chinese garden for the first time and immediately knew it was where we wanted to be married.”\nCaroline and Ian both love Chinese film and architecture, and her father is even a China scholar—but ultimately, they were mostly drawn to the location because of its atmosphere. “We loved that people could spread out and wander the paths, meeting each other in motion and sitting down together along the built-in seats instead of being closed in one area together,” explains Caroline. “The circular doorways, central koi pond, and looming stones had an otherworldly tone that made everyone feel very much farther from the city than we were, and because the paths are mostly covered, we could be surrounded by nature regardless of the weather.”\nAesthetically, they wanted things to feel elegant and elemental with a few surprises here and there. “We used indigo and ivory throughout, with touches of orange in honor of both autumn and the two persimmons Ian brought over in a paper bag the first time we had dinner together,” says Caroline nostalgically. “Ian and I both loved the tales of King Arthur as children, so that naturally found its way into a few choices, like a ’60s cake knife with a swordlike shape.” They went with textures like rice paper, wood, stone, and antique metal wherever they had the choice. And they preferred handwriting to calligraphy on their invitations, so they addressed the envelopes themselves, and enlisted their dear friend Maayan Zilberman—who has beautiful handwriting—to make the place cards.\n“For wardrobe, we were so lucky to have stylist Kat Typaldos help us,” says Caroline. “I’ve been working with her for stage and videos for four years now, so we’re really on the same wavelength. I wanted something simple that felt classical and futuristic at the same time, but it also had to be comfortable so that walking and breathing wouldn’t be burdened. It was a tall order, but I found an image of this J. Mendel dress online and immediately fell in love, and with Kat’s help, I was trying it on the next day. We knew it was the one as soon as I put it on; it didn’t even need any tailoring. J. Mendel just added three buttons in the back so I could bustle it up for dancing.”\nKat also connected Caroline with Shane Gabier and Christopher Peters at Creatures of the Wind , who custom-designed the perfect silk trousers and bustier for her reception. They also made a showstoppingly exquisite jacket embroidered with two nightingales and persimmons, but in all the excitement and dancing, “I was sadly too hot to bear a fitted layer,” says Caroline. “So I made the impromptu decision to instead wear the sheer kimono, which was a gift from my sister that I had brought along to wear while getting ready.” Caroline’s veil was designed by tailor Grace Kim. “I wanted it to lie as flat against my head as possible,” says Caroline, “so she came up with the idea of doing the ‘palm’ formation of very fine darts running up the back, like a hand or star holding my head.” In keeping with the spirit of the simple ceremony, Caroline wanted to keep her makeup minimal, so she opted to do her own. “I’m used to doing it for stage at this point, and I find it calming,” she says.\nThe couple were married in the Tea Room, which opened onto the Chinese garden via sliding screens. Family was seated in the front, with friends standing behind them. Caroline and Ian’s parents and siblings met them at the back entrance to the garden, and they formed a simple procession through the covered stone walkways of the garden, up and into the space. “We were married by my opera teacher, Pam Kuhn, whom I studied with as a teenager and returned to in 2013, and who has since become a mentor to me,” says Caroline. “Ian and I wrote seven vows, and between reading each one, Pam rang a bell, which was a gift I’d given Ian earlier this year. The short silence and sound between each vow let us really focus on what was being said. Our ceremony was to-the-point, about 12 minutes from start to finish.”\nAfter the ceremony, cocktail hour began in the Chinese garden. “Our friend Ross Menuez curated some beautiful rare records to play, which echoed out of the Tea Room and across the pond,” says Caroline. The party then moved into the nearby pavilion for dinner, where the tables each had a different candelabrum surrounded by a nest of flowers, greenery, and persimmons. “We imposed our diet on our guests for the evening and served only vegetarian and pescatarian options,” says Caroline. “Dinner was soundtracked by a playlist we’d made of all our favorite music that wouldn’t have been right for the dance floor, and there were toasts. Then Ian and I had our first dance to Patty Waters’s ‘You Thrill Me,’ after which our friends Molly Hawkins [Young Turks Records] and Ethan Silverman [Terrible Records] spun a lovingly selected set of soul, classic hip-hop, and ’80s pop. Our amazing florist, Brittany Asch of BRRCH, created the table arrangements in segments so everyone could take a piece and make their way home with flowers in hand, which was such a lovely parting gift at the end of the night.”\nPost-reception, a group relocated to Brooklyn, where Caroline’s managers had organized an intimate after-party that her bandmate, Patrick Wimberly, deejayed. “Mercifully, our photographer didn’t come, though!” says Caroline. “It got wild!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:03:43.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
