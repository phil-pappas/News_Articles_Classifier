The projected sales will be a one percent decrease from September 2015 , but an 11.5 percent increase from October 2014 . Edmunds projects that the sales volume and SAAR will be the biggest for an October since 2001.\nOne month after the news broke of Volkswagen's diesel \"cheat device\" crisis, October sales data suggest that the company is fighting to grow its overall sales. Edmunds projects VW and Audi will combine to grow sales 5.1 percent from October 2014 . However, a closer look at the individual brands suggests that Audi is responsible for all of that growth: Edmunds forecasts that Audi's October sales will increase 15.3 percent year over year, while Volkswagen's brand sales will remain flat from October 2014 .\n\"In this year of booming auto sales, no automaker should be relieved to see flat year-over-year performance, but this may be the best that Volkswagen can hope for this month,\" says Edmunds.com Senior Analyst Jessica Caldwell . \"Until VW starts down a road to recovery by informing owners of a specific fix to their diesel vehicles, the company is likely to make far fewer sales than this surging market would otherwise deliver to them.\"\nSALES VOLUME FORECAST, BY MANUFACTURER\nSales Volume\nOctober 2015 Forecast\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2015\nChange from October 2014\nChange from September 2015\nGM\n254,050\n226,819\n251,310\n12.0%\n1.1%\nFord\n214,603\n187,897\n221,269\n14.2%\n-3.0%\nFCA\n194,313\n170,480\n193,019\n14.0%\n0.7%\nToyota\n194,255\n180,580\n194,399\n7.6%\n-0.1%\nHonda\n130,730\n121,172\n133,750\n7.9%\n-2.3%\nNissan\n112,357\n103,117\n121,782\n9.0%\n-7.7%\nHyundai/Kia\n107,373\n94,775\n113,835\n13.3%\n-5.7%\nVW/Audi\n47,789\n45,463\n43,481\n5.1%\n9.9%\nIndustry\n1,424,568\n1,277,844\n1,439,016\n11.5%\n-1.0%\n*NOTE: October 2015 had 28 selling days, October 2014 had 27 and September 2015 had 25.\nEdmunds.com estimates that retail SAAR will come in at 14.9 million vehicles in October, with fleet transactions accounting for 16.4 percent of total sales.
