So rather than compromise quality and the hotel’s hard earned reputation, its owners took a rather unprecedented step: they closed it completely in 2008 for four long years of renovations, totaling $150 million. The recognizable awning and grand curved lobby staircase look the same, but just about everything else in the hotel was essentially brand new.[caption id=\"attachment_15049\" align=\"\" width=\"685\"] Celebrity chef Daniel Boulud put his name on the hotel restaurant after reopening. It just earned Forbes 4-Stars.[/caption]It was worth the long wait, and this summer, readers of Travel + Leisure magazine named it the best city hotel in Canada. U.S. News & World Report also named it Canada’s best, while it became the only hotel in Quebec to earn 5 AAA Diamonds. It also earned eight Forbes Stars in 2015 - four each for the hotel and the new restaurant that came with the grand reopening, Maison Boulud by famed chef Daniel Boulud. I stayed when I recently visited the city (as a guest of the Tourism Board) and it lived up to these lofty expectations, which is not usually the case. In addition to the restaurant - which has downtown’s only garden with outdoor seating - the hotel got a new penthouse salt water pool, steam and sauna facility, Canada’s first and only Dom Perignon branded bar, and a full new spa is under construction.[caption id=\"attachment_15048\" align=\"\" width=\"686\"] The hotel's top to bottom renovation included creating some of the best bathrooms in the entire Ritz-Carlton brand, complete with automated Japanese toilets.[/caption]But the biggest improvement for guests are the rooms, which are superb even for a luxury hotel. While many modern hotels emphasize technology for technology’s sake, here it is used extensively - for guest convenience. The rooms marry form with function, and control panels use simple icons like a light bulb with a slash through it that darkens the room completely, a simple concept, yet one that seems to befuddle most hotel room designers. The blackout curtains and blackout blinds, both automated, do an excellent job, and a do not disturb button next to the door eliminates the need for hang tags, There are plenty of outlets and USB ports, including several at the desk, while many hotels still fell the need to hide them behind couches and heavy furniture. There is even a noise sensor/motion system so if you forget to put on the do not disturb light, the maid still can usually tell if you are in the room and won’t bother you. Best of all are the luxury bathrooms, very large, with radiant heated floors, oversized walk-in shower, separate soaking tub, motion detector floor level lights for nighttime visits, first rate amenities and most of all, a fully featured automated Japanese toilet. These are awesome but rarely seen outside of top Japanese hotels. All stays include the bells and whistles a luxury hotel should offer, including free fast wifi, free shoeshine, high-end linens, good turndown service, a pillow menu, and bathroom extras like a dental kit.[caption id=\"attachment_15053\" align=\"\" width=\"686\"] The renovation added this salt water pool.[/caption]But at the end of the day, anyone can throw a lot of money into rooms, and what makes a luxury hotel really luxurious is staff and service, and this is where the Ritz-Carlton Montreal excels. Since half the original building was converted to residences with separate entrance, the actual hotel is much smaller than it looks, with just 98 rooms and 31 suites, and it is really an urban boutique hotel with big hotel facilities. The front door staff and front desk staff is consistent, remember you, and every time you come and go it has that feel of coming home, probably the hardest thing for hotels to establish. Maids are friendly in the hall, and staff is proactive in their service. I loved the hotel.[caption id=\"attachment_15050\" align=\"\" width=\"686\"] The lobby is home to Canada's only Dom Perignon branded bar.[/caption]The one exception was breakfast, which is just so-so for the high price, and while Maison Boulud is the real deal, a true fine ding eatery for lunch and dinner, breakfast, while very busy, seems to be an oversight for both food and staff. I rarely complain out loud in these situations, but when I did, the manger simply shrugged my comments off instead of doing something about them.[caption id=\"attachment_15051\" align=\"\" width=\"686\"] Much of the year guests can dine outside on the garden terrace - the only one in downtown - where the chefs grow herbs for the restaurant.[/caption]The hotel also has a very rich and colorful history and has been home to everyone from Queen Elizabeth II and President George W. Bush to Winston Churchill, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Howard Hughes, and the Rolling Stones. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton got married here, Cesar Ritz himself launched the hotel’s famous afternoon tea service, and Sophia Loren cooked her own pasta meals in her suite. Based on the renovations and service standard, the hotel is looking towards another century of this tradition of excellence. PROS: Extremely well-appointed rooms with luxurious bathrooms, high-tech Japanese toilets and user friendly in-room technology; scale and intimacy not found at many other premier urban luxury hotels; friendly and efficient staff and excellent service; home to one of Montreal’s premier fine dining eateries. CONS: Renovation in 2012 did not include a spa, which has been missing link, but one is currently under construction; breakfast overpriced and under-achieving.
