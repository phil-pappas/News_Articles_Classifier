The visit, which ran from Sept 22 to 25, saw the president stop in Seattle and Washington. He also went to New York to attend a series of activities to mark the 70th anniversary of the United Nations. After meeting US President Barack Obama in the capital on Sept 25, the leaders issued a joint statement saying they had agreed that a prompt response should be given to requests for information and assistance concerning malicious cyber activities. “Neither country’s government would conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property,” the statement read. We've agreed to set up a cyberspace working group... it was an important step forward The leaders had also agreed to set up a high-level dialogue on cyber security to be held twice annually. The statement represented great progress, according to Teng Jianqun, director of American studies at the China Institute of International Studies. “The two countries used to voice merely their own demands when addressing the issue of cyber security. Now they have expanded their agreement concerning this issue,” he said. Stapleton Roy, a former US ambassador to China, told Xinhua that the White House meetings produced a “breakthrough” on cyber theft as the two leaders agreed such behaviour was a crime and that both governments would seek to curb it. “We’ve agreed to set up a senior working group to deal with norms in cyberspace and we have a senior joint dialogue mechanism to deal with issues of cyber crime,” he said. “It was an important step forward.” China-US dialogue fruitful In all, Mr Xi’s visit yielded a basket of results, including 49 agreements, with progress made in areas such as investment, people-to-people exchanges and co-operation in multilateral affairs. Talks also produced a China-US joint presidential statement on climate change, which specified the steps the two sides would to take to deliver on pledges made last year to slash greenhouse gas emissions. These included China’s decision to launch a carbon cap and trade system in 2017 as well as establish a 20 billion yuan (£2 billion) fund to help other developing countries to combat and adapt to climate change. Mr Xi also put forward a six-point proposal for the development of China-US relations during talks with Mr Obama. The leaders also had a three-hour informal meeting. In Seattle, his first stop, the Chinese president said China and the US should read each other’s strategic intentions correctly. The goal was to stabilise relations as the US enters two years of turbulent domestic politics He also reached out to American entrepreneurs in the city as well as visited a Boeing factory and the headquarters of Microsoft. The summit between the two presidents was expected to stabilise relations “and I think it maybe exceeded those expectations a little bit”, said Douglas Paal, vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank. “The goal was to stabilise relations as the US enters what will be two years or more of really turbulent domestic politics and a transition to a new administration.” Americans will head to polls to elect a new president next year and analysts have predicted that ties between Beijing and Washington will be a key feature of the candidates’ campaigns. “So we needed the leaders to have some reasonable understanding of the limits of what they are going to do and the things they will not do,” said Mr Paal. “That was largely achieved.” Su Ge, president of the China Institute of International Studies, said Mr Xi had sent a clear message in his speeches to the US that there was no need for Washington to worry about whether his country intended to overturn the international order. “Mr Xi has directly called on both countries to read the intentions correctly and not allow the key relationship to be derailed by their differences,” he said. “It’s of great political significance.” In New York, the Chinese president told the UN General Assembly that his nation would contribute 8,000 troops to a peacekeeping standby force. He also presided over a South- South co-operation roundtable and a women’s affairs summit • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:53:37.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
