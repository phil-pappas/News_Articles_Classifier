I walked in the door and his father Des said to me: “Hang on a second Eddie, he's very injured. Please treat him with kid gloves.” Luke was physically fragile in that moment, but not mentally. Our conversation centred on his injury, and he knew what he was going to have to put himself through to get back. But he had such determination. He knew he was going to get back to the level required to play international rugby. I remember it vividly, because we were in the kitchen of the Fitzgerald home and, after a short while talking to him about his injury, he looked at me and said: “Eddie, I’ll be back playing.” Des was there nodding in agreement. I’d known the two men long enough to know that he meant it. That he would be back. And true to form, he was. When you play a sport you have a risk of injury. It doesn’t matter whether it’s horse racing, hurling, football or rugby. When they represent their country, all these players are prepared to take the knocks. They’re like warriors. They get back on the horse and they start going again. Luke inherited his talent from his parents, school and from playing every sport available to him Luke brushed himself down and said, there’s something more for me and Ireland, and that’s what he did. I think Luke is lucky in sporting terms because of his DNA, because of the parents he has in Andrea and Des. They have both played sport at the highest level. They also back Luke to the hilt, and the Fitzgeralds are a wonderful, and indeed formidable, family. Luke inherited his talent from his parents, from school, and from playing every sport available to him. And the key was that each of those sports was a team game. Team spirit: Luke in the back row fourth from left For Luke, that understanding of camaraderie happened at a young age. It’s very difficult to have it in an individual sport, but Luke has been in a team situation since he was around the age of eight or nine. The photos demonstrate that. He was playing in an all­Ireland final at nine, representing his club Cork and Munster. Not many people can put their hand up and say that. It had to mean something. 32 counties together The players in the Ireland squad will be tightly united by now, like a family. They spend a lot of time together. Whoever comes in, from whatever part of the country, the big bonus is that it’s all 32 counties involved. It’s not like in the soccer where you have northern Ireland and Ireland. The rugby is different. You have everyone representing the full country. That’s why I think the rugby team is the standard-bearer for Ireland. It’s the pinnacle. These guys put in extra time because they want to be involved in these high-profile games around the world, representing Ireland and everybody talking about them. Medal winner: Luke in the back row fourth from right There could be an unknown rugby player up in Ulster, and down in Cork there will be people who have heard of him.... You can become an overnight hero playing in this tournament. There’s a tough weekend coming up for Ireland. If you don’t get it right against France you can be punished. Luke and the boys will be taking it all in. We’re all willing for Luke to be playing, but he’s a cog in a big wheel. The game of rugby is not 15 anymore. Number one to 31 is equally important. There’s no doubt the interest in Rugby World Cup 2015 is growing. We’re a sports-mad country and, a lot of the time, there are other sports going on. But the Ireland and France game is at 4.45pm on Sunday, so the other sports have moved their games to two o’clock. It’s going to be an epic battle. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:12:10.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
