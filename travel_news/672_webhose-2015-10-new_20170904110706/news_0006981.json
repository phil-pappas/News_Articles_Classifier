Explore Santorini, a Popular Cyclades Islands Travel Destination \nSantorini, also known as Thera or Thira, is a volcanic island, the southernmost island of the Cyclades (see our Cyclades Map ). There are thirteen villages on Santorini and fewer than 14 thousand people, a number which swells during the summer months, when Santorini's famous beaches are clogged with sun worshipers. From the map you can see the volcanic structure that, before exploding, formed a single island. Map of Santorini Â© James Martin, licensed to About.com Getting to Santorini \nThe National Airport of Santorini is located near Monolithos, eight kilometers to the southeast of Fira. You can take a domestic flight from Athens which takes a little sess than an hour and a half. It takes about 20 minutes to go from the airport to Fira. Compare fares to Santorini Airport (JTR) \nIn Greece, ferries are far more numerous in summer than other seasons. Beware of this when researching ferry tickets. Get the low down on low-season travel with: Greek Ferries . \nThe ferry from Piraeus (the port of Athens) will get you to Santorini in 7-9 hours. You can shave a couple of hours by taking a catamaran or hydrofoil. Check ferry schedules from Piraeus to Santorini. \nOnce on Santorini, you can get frequent ferry connections to other Cyclades islands as well as Rhodes, Crete and Thessaloniki. From Rhodes you can take a ferry to Turkey. Places to Visit on Santorini \nSantorini's capital is Fira , which sits on the caldera side of the island perched on a cliff 260 meters above the sea. It hosts an Archaeological museum with the finds from the Minoan settlement of Akrotiri, shown by the red box south of the modern village of Akrotiri. The Megaron Gyzi Museum contains a collection of pictures of Fira from before and after the earthquake of 1956. Fira's old port is for cruise boats, the port further south (shown on the map) is used for ferries and cruise ships. There are the usual tourist shops with a heavy emphasis on jewelery in Fira. \nImerovigli connects to Fira via footpath through Ferastefani, where you'll get that Kodak moment when you look back. \nOia is famous for the views over Santorini at sunset, especially near the Kastro (castle) walls, and is quieter than Fira, although it does get quite packed on a summer's eve. \nMany people think that Perissa has the best beach on the island, a 7 kilometer long black sand beach with lots of facilities for beach bums. Perissa has religious festivals on the 29th of August and 14th of September. Kamari has the island's other black beach. Both Kamari and Perissa have diving centers. \nIf you're looking for a more quiet beach experience, difficult on Santorini, Vourvoulos in the northeast is about as good as it gets. \nMegalochori has several interesting churches, and is a center for tasting the wine of Santorini along with Messaria , which also features lots of shopping for those of you who do that sort of thing on vacation. Messaria also features winding streets and characteristic churches as well as good tavernas. \nEmporio has a castle and winding streets that confounded pirates in the olden days. \nYou'll find the Museum of Prehistoric Thera in Akrotiri , along with excavations from the 17th century bc found to the south of the modern city. The red sand beach of Akrotiri is near the ancient site and there you can catch boats to other beaches. \nSantorini is also a producer of fine wines. Jacquelyn Vadnais got a tip on a hot winery from a waitress, and her tasting at Domaine Sigalas Santorini is recounted in Yes... There Is Wine Tasting In Santorini, Greece . When to Go \nSantorini is hot in the summer, but it's a dry heat--and there are many beaches waiting to help you dissipate that heat. In fact, Santorini is only one of two places in Europe to be classified as having a desert climate. Spring and fall is the best time to travel, but folks flock to the island in summer. For historic climate charts for travel planning, see: Santorini Climate and Weather . The Archaeology of Santorini \nBesides the Museum in Akrotiri, the two major archaeological sites on Santorini are ancient Akrotiri and ancient Thira. Ancient Akrotiri is sometimes called the \"Minoan Pompeii\" because of the huge volcanic eruption of 1450 bc. In Akrotiri the people seemed to have escaped; no human remains have been discovered by archaeologists. \nAncient Thira is high above the popular beaches of Kamari and Perissa. The town was occupied by the Dorians in the 9th century bc. \nSacred Destinations has good information for both sites: Ancient Akrotiri | Ancient Thira . Where to Stay \nRomantics usually stay in hotels or villas with a view of the caldera, often in Oia and Fira. These can be expensive. Venere lists accommodations in Oia (also called Ia): Ia Hotels (book direct), and Fira: Fira Hotels . There are also listiings for apartments and guest houses for either city. To look for all user-rated hotels on Santorini with a map, see: Hotels Santorini . \nAnother option is to rent a villa on the island. What could be more romantic than that? How about a cave house? Vacation rentals are available from HomeAway: Santorini Vacation Rentals .
