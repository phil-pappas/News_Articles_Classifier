Five major crosswalks converge together, and up to 2500 people try to cross the road at each change of lights. But remarkably, it’s orderdly. There’s no pushing and everyone is polite. \nThat could be because the crossing is in Tokyo, the world’s largest city. Its 34 million residents are used to crowds, and even during rush hour everyone is totally ordered. \nThe busy crossing is located in the city’s Shibuya district, home to one of Tokyo’s busiest train stations. \nIt’s a cacophony of noise, of billboards, mega-lighting, neons, cool kids, gigantic buildings and fast strides. \nBut when the pedestrian light turns green, the race is on and they’re (we ALL are) on a pedestrian crossing mission. \nBut in among what COULD be a complete schmozzle and pacing disaster zone, everyone gets where they are going with little fuss. It’s an awesome spectacle of giant video screens and neon.

It’s a great way to pass the time, watching the crossing. Source: Supplied More neon and crazy vending machines. Photo: Melissa Hoyer \nThere was no clashing in the middle — crossing the road is more like poetry in motion, a nearly choreographed event (or a fluid Tai-Chi or yoga class, at least) where every movement seemed to be ordered and seamless. \nAt each given time, the mass of legs and moving bodies may only last a minute, but as soon as that 60 seconds of movement is up, the crossing reverts back to being a sea of bleeting and beeping cars, buses and coloured taxis. \nSure, there are always a few stragglers. (Hello me!) - who use every last second to finally get to the ‘other side’. (Usually busy on a device snapping away.) \nIt’s funny, but nearly everywhere else in the world a huge pedestrian crossing like this could be daunting. \nBut weirdly, all of the passing peeps don’t seem as chaotic and mad as those on other major intersections in cities like New York, Paris, London, Melbourne, Sydney or the total madness of Beijing. \nSimply, the simple art of walking through a pedestrian crossing at Shibuya is an experience. \nOf course there is potential for a bit of human collision, but for some strange reason, it all runs so systematically and ordered. \nAnd who would ever think that this would be something you would want to put on your travel bucket list? (By the way, Shibuya is also the home to Tokyo’s best night life.) \nWell, I did. I did it. And it was actually best to experience the crossing at night time. \nEven at 9pm, the place was buzzing with mega lights and billboards making it even more exhilarating and exciting. \nAs simple as it sounds, but how much fun was is to be part of one minute of pure, pedestrian madness and be part of complete anonymity in a sea of humans. \nAnd all with just one common goal: to get from one side of the main streets of Shibuya to another. \nMelissa is in Tokyo as a guest of fashion retailer, Max & Co. \nFollow the conversation on Twitter and Instagram @melissahoyer Holiday Picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:50:05.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
