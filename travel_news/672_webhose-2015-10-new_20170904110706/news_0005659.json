It is now easier to do so. You’ve squirrelled away your cash throughout your career so your pension will provide you with a comfortable retirement. Now, thanks to changes in the way pensions are taxed, more of your hard-earned savings can survive your death and be left for your loved ones to enjoy after you are gone. This is because, although pensions aren’t counted as someone’s estate for inheritance tax purposes, there used to be hefty 55pc pensions death tax until earlier this year. In April, this was scrapped as part of the Government’s “pensions freedoms”, which also marked the end of the requirement for savers to swap life savings to buy an annuity. There is now an opportunity to leave some, or all, of your pot to your loved ones in a tax-efficient way. So how does it work? If you want to leave your pension pot to your children or grandchildren, what do you have to do to make sure they get the most out of your retirement savings? Putting money into pensions rather than property could reduce the tax bill after your death If you die before 75, your nominated beneficiaries will not have to pay any tax on withdrawals, whether as an income or as a lump sum. On your 75th birthday, your pension assets become taxable, but only at the marginal rate of income tax. Currently, a charge of 45pc will apply if benefits are taken as a lump sum, although this is due to change in April 2016 when the beneficiary’s marginal rate of income tax will apply. You can nominate anyone – your children, grandchildren or even friends – to inherit your remaining pension fund as a drawdown account. This means beneficiaries can dip into the pension pot they inherit at their choosing, which could come in handy for covering education costs, getting that first foot on the property ladder or even preparing for their own old age. What’s more, putting money into pensions rather than property or other investments could help reduce the tax bill after your death. Child's play: leaving savings to your children is easier now Inheritance tax is charged at 40pc on assets worth more than £325,000 for a single person or £650,000 for married couples or civil partners. These changes give savers a far greater incentive to leave their capital in a pension that can be passed to the next generation and drawn as income from within the pension system in a tax-efficient way. In practice, retirees might prefer to delay the purchase of an annuity until after they reach 75 and run down other assets instead, or even add to their pensions where possible. For people with money invested outside a pension, it can make financial sense to use their pension allowance. Non-taxpayers can pay up to £2,880 a year into a pension, and benefit from tax relief that takes it up to £3,600. People with earnings after retirement age could potentially invest even more into their pension, up to the £40,000-a-year limit and the £1.25m lifetime allowance (falling to £1m in April 2016), with lower annual restrictions depending on what they have already drawn from their pension pot. To make sure you can pass on your pension in a tax-efficient manner, there are a few things to do. First, pension savers should meet their own retirement needs before providing for their descendants. Here it makes sense to take your 25pc tax-free cash lump sum before you turn 75. If you don’t, it will be counted as taxable. Pension providers should allow you to nominate your beneficiaries when you start paying into your pension Then check whether your pension plan allows you to pass on your savings in a tax-efficient way, as some older styles of schemes may not allow your beneficiaries to inherit your fund as a drawdown account. If this is the case, you may need to upgrade to a more modern pension that does, although this is not a decision to be taken lightly as valuable guarantees sometimes apply to older pensions. The next move is to give up-to-date details of the nominated beneficiaries of your pension fund to your provider. This might involve using an expression of wish form, as your will does not do this. Pension providers should allow you to nominate your beneficiaries when you start paying into your pension or at any subsequent time – some even allow you to do it online. What’s more, it’s possible to nominate more than one beneficiary and stipulate the proportion you want to leave each person. For example, if you have grandchildren, it can be more tax-efficient to leave a portion of your pension directly to them after you turn 75. That way, each grandchild can make the most of their £10,600 personal income tax allowance – so, if they have no other sources of income, they can each withdraw up to £10,600 from your pension tax-free, every year. By contrast, if you die after the age of 75 and leave your pension to your children, they would have to pay their highest rate of income tax on the pension withdrawal.
