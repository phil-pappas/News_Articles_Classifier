Here's how to keep car journeys as peaceful as possible while transporting your little passengers. Start early It’s a sharp move to get two hours of road under your belt while the nippers sleep and the motorways are empty. If you can safely secrete the kids into your car without waking them, the motion of travel should also keep them from stirring. To clock some serious miles while the car is quiet will seem like heaven after the blighters have awoken. Assign seats We have a six-year-old and a 16-year-old and we find that the car is far more harmonious with the teenager sitting upfront. We then have an adult looking after each young ’un. This also cuts out those sibling spats that force you to crank your neck round to officiate. If you have a large car, divide the kids in the back with a barrier of bags, so they can have their own private space. Work as a team If you're travelling with your partner it’s essential to work as a team. Divided, you will fall and – make no bones about it – this is a potential war zone. Rather than have the kids initiate conversations, invariably around going to the toilet or wanting food, dictate the in-car conversations before they have a chance to monopolise. If you have a teenager, ask them open questions about school or future careers. Don’t be interrogatory, but gentle, positive. This is a prime chance to let the teens “gob off”. A long car journey can sometimes be a great way of getting a captive troublesome teen to open up more. If you have younger kids, you will want to avoid spats, and perhaps fully-charged tablets are the answer. Anyone who can remember analogue car journeys will testify that a 90-minute film on an iPad is worth a million parlour games of Red Lorry Yellow Lorry. Sad but true. Baby wipes A pack of bottom tissues is worth its weight in gold on a car journey; one hundred pennies well spent, on an item that can mop chocolate, freshen mucky faces and wipe away tears. They're handy with the kids too. Boom! Food and drink You’re better off with drinks that deceive the body into thinking it’s getting refreshed rather than a giant bottle of chilled water which will need to be expelled within 23 minutes of consumption. A tub of fruit, or a little carton of orange juice or smoothie is going to cut down on those annoying toilet stops at motorway services, and the subsequent rows over wanting tat from the shops. A bag of sucking sweets is far more advantageous than quickly-consumed sticky chocolate. My stepfather was a sales rep and he wouldn’t travel anywhere without a paper bag of sherbet lemons. Avoid car games with the very young It sounds like a good idea, but any competition, especially between siblings, could cause disputes. “You’re not blue cars, you’re red! Mum! She’s cheating!” You don’t need it. Games like Who Am I? – where a person thinks of a person, real or fictional and can only answer yes or no to questions – are better for younger sprogs. We sometimes get the youngest to read out the miles left – from the road signs – before we get to our destination. This defuses any groans of “Are we there yet?”. Get organised Get that postcode entered into the sat nav and make sure you know exactly what you’re doing. The most stressed I have seen my kids is when I’ve been staring at a crumpled map, watching roads pass faster than I can acknowledge or when I’m caught up in the insanity of a one-way system. As soon as you enter the stress zone, the nippers start playing up. The more organised you are, the more time and patience you will have to deal with the kids. The more relaxed you are, the more sedate they will be. It sometimes helps to put your phone on Flight Mode so no annoying work emails appear when there’s absolutely chuff all you can do about them. Tired and emotional If your kids are grumpy and tired, then facilitate them getting some shut-eye. Pack their favourite blanket, give them a soft pillow, a shade across the window and anything by The Lighthouse Family should be enough to send them into a deep, deep sleep. If your kids are arguing, why not pull over at the nearest services and get them to release all their anger and frustration and tears in a choreographed “shout off”. Like primal scream therapy, only at Birchanger Services. Music Music can be a source of frustration, whether you’re entertaining toddlers or teenagers. So you could set up a playlist at home and get everyone to take turns picking a tune. If you want to be less democratic, why not pick a soundtrack album to a film they all love, because it will be a much more immersive experience than 73 seconds of a song before the inevitable cries of “this is actually quite lame!”. If your kids are really giving off sparks, how about an album of Peruvian nose-flute anthems played by humpback whales? Curve balls Sometimes something “unexpected” can make a long car journey pass less tempestuously. Maybe bring up a conundrum that you need the children’s help to solve. Should Dad change careers and become a pot-bellied pig farmer? Should Mum learn to fly helicopters? Throw the kids off their usual trajectories. A friend of mine, let’s call her Jodie, gets the kids painting and doing crafty stuff immediately before the car journey. She makes sure their hands are suitably covered in PVA glue, then, once they’re in the car, they spend hours peeling off all the dried paste. Genius!
