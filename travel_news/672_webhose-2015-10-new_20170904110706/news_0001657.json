With its rich and bloody history, many of the hotels are situtated in the UK. Guests staying in each of the hotels have reported seeing ghosts, hearing strange sounds and feeling odd presences. So if you fancy a sleepless night, then these could be the places to stay. The Langham Hotel, England One of the \"spookiest\" hotels is in the heart of London. The Langham Hotel is reportedly frequented by many ghosts including a doctor, rumoured to have killed himself after murdering his bride, whilst they honeymooned in the hotel. Other guests have reported sightings of a man in military attire standing by a window on the fourth floor – this is said to be the ghost of a German prince who jumped out of a window before the start of the First World War. The Ettington Park Hotel, England This hotel near Stratford-upon-Avon was used as the location for 1963 film 'The Haunting'. A servant girl called Mary who died after a fall at the property has been seen many times around the house, whilst two children who drowned in the Stour River in 1800 apparently haunt one of the hallways. Prince Rupert Hotel, England In Shrewsbury the Grade II listed Prince Rupert Hotel was once home to Prince Rupert, the grandson of King James I. The Prince Philip Suite at the hotel is apparently haunted by a jilted bride who is said to have hanged herself in the room after the groom left on her wedding night. Many guests reported seeing a hanging woman in the suite and objects inexplicably moving around the room. The Swan Hotel, England The Swan Hotel in Suffolk was once a thriving coaching inn. Apparently, a spirit of a former housekeeper haunts the inn – she is said to have committed suicide in room 15 which was once the housekeeping quarters. Several guests of room 15 have reported seeing her standing in the middle of the room in the middle of the night. Airth Castle, Scotland Guests at this hotel have reported the sound of children playing in guest rooms 3, 9 and 23 – many suspect these are the ghosts of two children who died along with their nanny in a fire at the castle. Shieldhill Castle, Scotland Since opening this year, there have been reported sightings of two ghosts, a butler and a 'grey lady'. The woman is said to have been a member of the aristocratic family who owned the buildings until the 1950s. It is rumoured that she killed herself in the castle after her father stopped her marriage to a commoner. The Russell Hotel, Australia The Russell Hotel was formerly a sailor's hostel. Dating back to early colonial days, room eight is apparently home to a spectral sailor, who stands and stares at guests in the middle of the night when they are trying to sleep. The Historic Anchorage Hotel, USA This Alaskan hotel has apparently been the site of ghostly happenings for many years. The ghosts are thought to be related to the death of Anchorage's first Police Chief 'Blackjack', found shot in the back with a bullet from his own gun, just steps from the hotel. Hauntings occur every year on the date of the crime, which remains unsolved to this day The Stanley Hotel, USA Many guests and employees at the Stanley Hotel which opened in 1909 have reported ghostly activity, primarily from the ballroom of the hotel where people have allegedly heard a party going on, only to find it empty. Guests have reported jewellery, watches and luggage going missing, said to be the result of a 'ghost thief' who steals things in the night before hiding in the closet. Bourbon Orleans, USA Dating back to 1817, the hotel in New Orleans was once a thriving ballroom before being turning into a convent and orphanage. During its time as a convent, a yellow fever epidemic struck the city killing thousands of people. Many of the reported ghostly sightings at the hotel have been children, including a girl chasing her ball down the sixth floor corridor.
