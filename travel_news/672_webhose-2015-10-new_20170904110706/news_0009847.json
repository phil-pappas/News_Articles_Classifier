Likewise, it took time before Chai Nat, a quiet province in the Central Plains, could become a BMX racing hotspot: three weeks! \nThat's the amount of time it took the provincial administration organisation of Chai Nat, which played host to the fifth, and final, round of the 2015 BMX National Championship Series, to build the race venue for the grand event from zero. And the result was impressive, as you can see in the photos that were taken a day before the race and just a couple of days after the racecourse was completed. \nThe new BMX track at the foot of Khao Khayai, one of the group of hills just east of the downtown area, is part of Chai Nat governor Sutthipong Chulcharoen's lofty plan to make cycling another thing that the province is known for, apart from its long-famous bird park and the khao taengkwa pomelo . A stone's throw from Khao Khayai is Khao Phlong, which is home to a legendary downhill mountain bike trail. And on Khao Khayai itself, there is a newly built cross-country trail. It's there that the governor, an avid biker himself, had a nasty crash in mid July. \nHowever, the resulting injury, which required 70 stitches, apparently did not do any harm to his love for biking. Governor Sutthipong reportedly said that he would continue to ride as soon as he is fully recovered. On race day of the BMX Thailand Championship he also showed up to preside over the opening ceremony. \nNow let's get back to the BMX track. \nAfter the big race, the track is now open to the public free of charge. It has become a playground for local BMXers of all ages who gather here every evening to enjoy the variety of jumps, rollers and huge banked turns. For youngsters, just zooming down the slope from the tall starting ramp is already a load of fun. While novice riders use the gained momentum to simply glide over the first jumps, more experienced ones take to the air. The middle section of the track is divided into two lines. The one with larger jumps is for the pros while the other is for amateurs. During the race and practice days, racers flew over both lines like flying fish. It should be noted that some did not make it and had to be carried out of the track on a stretcher. \nOn those days a medic team was available but now every rider using the BMX track has to take care of his/herself. So if you plan to ride there, it is important to play safe and wear necessary protective gear such as full-face helmet and gloves, as well as elbow and knee guards. Also, be prepared for the risks every time you push your limit. \nAnd last but least, have fun! \nW ell, see you here again next Thursday.
