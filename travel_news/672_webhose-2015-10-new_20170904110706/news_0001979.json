What would you prefer? Mangos, spices, fresh snapper and an average year-round temperature of 26C, or treeless, snow-shrouded Nuuk? From 1754 to 1917 the islands of St Thomas, St John and St Croix were indeed royal Danish colonies. Ties with Copenhagen were only severed in the turmoil of the First World War, when they were sold to the United States for $25  million. Meanwhile, across a stretch of water known as the Narrows, lies the quieter and more exclusive British Virgin Islands, which have been under our jurisdiction since 1670. The landscapes and lifestyles of both overseas territories are similar – topsy-turvy green hills rising steeply to more than 1,000ft, glorious sandy beaches, limpid blue waters, an addiction to the joys of sailing, carnival and rum. But while the British islands come lightly washed with Uncle Sam’s influence, those across the water are soaked in it. As the vehicle licence plates put it, the US Virgin Islands are “America’s Caribbean”. US citizens don’t need a passport to visit and the capital, Charlotte Amalie, is one of the busiest cruise ports in the region. All the familiar hallmarks of the American way of life are here – folksy mailboxes, baseball diamonds, endless tipping, basketball matches showing on the never-turned-off television. There are no freeways but the vehicles are still massive, somehow getting around the steep, winding roads. These include custom-built, open-sided “safari taxis” that take 12 or more passengers. With typical Caribbean swagger, they invariably come with the owner’s name emblazoned across the windscreen. “Are you Mr Wonderful?” I ask one driver as he waits for a pick-up. “All the time,” he replies with a killer smile. Like nearby Puerto Rico, the islands have their own quirks and independent identity. Driving is on the left (unlike back home), and the USVI sends its own sports teams to the Olympics. There are home-grown public holidays such as Transfer Day (celebrating the buy-out from Denmark) and Emancipation Day, remembering the official abolition of slavery in 1848. The many years spent as the Danish West Indies are not forgotten, either. You will find glorious sandy beaches and limpid blue waters This is most obvious in Charlotte Amalie, named in honour of King Christian V’s queen, where the streets bear names such as Dronningens Gade and Kronprindsens Gade. The St Thomas Historical Trust runs guided walks that visit the port’s mighty Lutheran church, built in 1793, along with grand 19th-century government buildings and the warren of brick warehouses and narrow alleys bordering the harbour. Once piled high with rum, arms and contraband, today they are filled with duty-free shops selling jewellery, watches and sunglasses. Most poignant of all is the Danish cemetery in Hospital Ground where the graves, framed in conch shells and shaded by venerable mahogany trees, bear names such as Pedersen, Haack and Thorsøe. Colonial architecture on St Croix St Thomas was always a cosmopolitan place, thriving on trade rather than plantations. There is an immaculately kept, sand-floored synagogue in Crystal Gade that has held a service every sabbath since its inauguration in 1833, barring one when a hurricane struck. There is also a French legacy. The Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro was born here in 1830, while the Frenchtown quarter, originally created by immigrants from St Barths, is famous for its restaurants. Beyond the capital, St Thomas offers good, if busy, beaches and scenic drives with tremendous panoramas at times spliced with commercialism. At the Mountain Top viewpoint, set at 1,500ft, the order of play is very much “enter through the gift shop”. In order to behold the 20-strong chain of Virgin Islands basking in the sea like big green whales, I have to negotiate a vast hangar chock-full of souvenirs, T-shirts and visitors downing “world famous” banana daiquiris. Shopping is a prime activity in the USVI. There is no sales tax and US visitors are allowed to take home $1,600 (£1,043) worth of duty-free goods (twice as much as from other Caribbean islands), including six bottles of rum. Thankfully, life is not just about cruise ships and consumerism. One benefit of being a US territory is that the islands are part of the US National Parks system, a particular blessing in the case of neighbouring St John. This extremely scenic island is reached on a 15-minute ferry ride from Red Hook, and 60 per cent of it is protected, thanks in part to the philanthropy of Laurance S Rockefeller who donated 5,000 acres of land to the government in 1956. Here the Virgin Islands National Park delivers the Caribbean holiday dream to more than 400,000 visitors a year. Trunk Bay is its most lauded attraction, one of two well-kept Blue Flag beaches with lifeguards, showers and snorkel rental, with a small admission fee charged. Trunk Bay on St John The park also has 20 trails that yomp over the forested hills and out to breezy headlands. There are ranger-led walks, such as the popular half-day Reef Bay Trail, which involves a 15-minute ride in a safari taxi into the mountainous centre, then a two-mile descent to the sea followed by a 40-minute boat cruise back to the capital, Cruz Bay. Although described as “not easy” it is rarely challenging, and on the day I tackle it there are more than 20 walkers, making it more of an educational ramble than a hike, with stops to see petroglyphs, former slave dwellings and an old sugar factory. St John is also worth a taxi tour or day’s car rental, making your way out to East End and Salt Pond Bay while dodging the iguanas. Near the latter, where there is a superb, head-clearing beach, I find a small hillside restaurant that is called, with commendable honesty, The Tourist Trap. Its website address is wedontneednostinkingwebsite.com , and it is packed with American visitors gleefully tucking into nachos, hot dogs and lobster rolls. Alternatively, at nearby Miss Lucy’s, a simple single-storey building set by the sea, the menu is held down by lumps of brain coral and features local dishes such as callaloo, crab soup and fresh conch. In my experience, the best cuisine in these islands is Caribbean, although mixing things up is also fun. Dining at De’ Coal Pot in Cruz Bay one night, I find myself enjoying an excellent goat curry washed down with some strong Elephant beer from the Danish brewery Carlsberg. The dessert, meanwhile, is a thoroughly American Oreo-crusted chocolate soufflé. It seems a fine example of the happy fusion of heritages that is now the US Virgin Islands.
