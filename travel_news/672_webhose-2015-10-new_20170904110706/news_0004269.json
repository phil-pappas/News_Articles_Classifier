Owned by Chuzhou Alliance Hotel Management Co., Ltd., the hotel features sweeping city views alongside luxurious accommodations and amenities, including a variety of gourmet dining options. Sheraton Chuzhou Hotel marks the brand’s 70th hotel in the region, reaching over 110 hotels in Asia Pacific. \n“The opening of Sheraton Chuzhou Hotel is yet another example of Starwood’s most global hotel brand continuing its aggressive growth in strategic markets all over the world,” said Dave Marr, Global Brand Leader for Sheraton Hotels & Resorts. “China continues to be a vital market for Sheraton as it marches toward the brand goal of adding an additional 150 hotels globally by 2020.” Nestled between the Yangtze and Huaihe Rivers, Chuzhou is located in eastern Anhui Province near Nanjing. The new Sheraton Chuzhou Hotel is ideally situated in Zhengwu Centre, a short stroll from Chuzhou’s new Central Business District (CBD), a retail mall, shops and a theatre, and just 90 minutes from Nanjing Lukou International Airport (NKG). The hotel features 348 contemporary rooms and suites, featuring all of the brand’s signature amenities, as well as a wide range of on-property facilities, including a state-of-the-art Sheraton® Fitness Center, an indoor heated pool and luxury spa. In addition, Club Room guests will enjoy complimentary breakfast, afternoon hors d’oeuvres and a variety of beverage options in the hotel’s signature Sheraton® Club Lounge. Two distinctive dining venues at the Sheraton Chuzhou Hotel provide an array of culinary options—from international cuisine at the all-day dining FEAST® to Cantonese favorites at specialty Chinese restaurant YUE®. Expertly matched small plates, premium wines and craft beers will be available in the lobby as part of Paired — the Sheraton brand’s reinvigorated food and beverage program. To cater to meetings, conferences, and special events, Sheraton Chuzhou Hotel offers nearly 17,000 square feet of state-of-the-art conference space, including a deluxe grand ballroom that can accommodate up to 1,200 people. “The opening of the first Sheraton hotel in Chuzhou underscores Starwood’s continued commitment to aggressively expanding its footprint in the region and builds on the Sheraton brand’s long legacy as a first-mover in markets across China and Asia Pacific,” said Vincent Ong, Senior Brand Director, Asia Pacific Brand Management, Starwood Hotels & Resorts. “At Sheraton Chuzhou Hotel, guests will enjoy a comfortable and stylish atmosphere, as well as all of the brand’s signature amenities and services in a convenient location.” Chuzhou’s Fenyang is one of the four provincial-level cultural ancient cities in Anhui, known as the hometown of Zhu Yuanzhang, the founding emperor of the Ming Dynasty. From the hotel, guests can easily visit the large, ancient Ming Dynasty imperial tomb of his parents – a 600-year-old state protected mausoleum with a magnificent collection of vivid stone sculptures. Mount Langya – a national scenic spot which is home to attractions such as the highly regarded Tang Dynasty Buddhist Langya Temple, the South Heavenly Gate, and the famed Zuiwong (Old Drunkard), is also just a ten minute drive from the hotel.
