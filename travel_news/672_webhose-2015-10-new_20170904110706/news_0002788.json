Share article \nRAC head of external affairs, Pete Williams, said: “There is still an enormous gulf between what the law states – that handheld mobile phones should not be used behind the wheel – and what motorists see happening on our roads.” \nThe punishment most likely to hit drivers is a fixed penalty notice (FPN), three penalty points and a £100 fine or a motorist may be summoned to a magistrates’ court if they ignore or challenge an FPN.
