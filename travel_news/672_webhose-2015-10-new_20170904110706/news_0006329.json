Time and again it manages to surprise the world with the calibre of its chefs, the nature of its ingredients, and the style with which it puts the two together. So the big question is, what will be served up next by Australia’s leading foodies? That’s the spirit England has gin, France has cognac, Scotland has whisky and Kentucky has bourbon. Having grown up with such brilliant benchmarks, leading bar dudes from the land down under are now building local distilleries as well as importing them. What with Four Pillars gin in Victoria; Tasmania’s Lark Single Malt whiskey; Victoria’s Maidenii Vermouth and Vitek’s Vodka in New South Wales, it’s a brilliant way to get a real taste of Australia – served in small, bespoke bars. Try Melbourne’s cheeky little Bad Frankie’s bar, where the all-Australian spirits list is matched to an all-jaffle menu – the much-loved Aussie sandwich stuffed with anything from corned beef and pickled cabbage to ham and cheese, flattened and toasted. Australian rules At the glittering new Bennelong restaurant tucked in under the white sails of the Sydney Opera House, celebrated chef Peter Gilmore walks a fine line between high-end dining and down-home comfort food. Sausage rolls? Yes, poshed up with suckling pig and black garlic. Pavlova? Of course, brilliantly overhauled into a white snow-dome of rhubarb, raspberry and meringue, adorned with Opera House \"sails\" of crisp, light meringue. There is even a lamington, though not as you know it. Lammos at the Opera House – fair dinkum. Sniff out truffles Truffles? In Australia? Yes, it is the fourth largest truffle-producing country after France, Italy and Spain. The black treasures, farmed in rich soil under hazelnut trees in Tasmania, NSW and Western Australia, are rich, earthy and aromatic, and conveniently in season in July, at the opposite time of year to Europe. Check out the festivals in Canberra and Western Australia’s Manjimup for a real truffle kerfuffle. Beyond the barbecue Where there’s smoke, there’s a pile of kebabs, satay sticks or yakitori skewers and a whole lot of sizzle. Top Australian chefs are raising the simple grill to an art form by exploring their own culinary heritage by way of the barbie. In Brisbane, Emi Kamada and Marie Yokoyama’s excellent Bird’s Nest yakitori bar skewers every part of the bird, from skin to tail to egg; while Masterchef Australia judge George Calombaris is on a roll with his reinvented Greek souvlaki bars, Jimmy Grants, in Melbourne, offering souvas titled The Homer (falafel, Greek yoghurt, Hellenic slaw) and Mr Papadopoulos (lamb, mustard aioli, chips) Skewers at Bird’s Nest Ultimate farm-to-table Sure, you can take the produce of the farm to the table. But how much more fun is it, to take the table to the farm? Sydney’s surf-side Three Blue Ducks café has just transplanted itself into a 38 acre farm near Byron Bay, featuring a café, restaurant and produce store. In Birregurra in Victoria’s Otway ranges, Dan Hunter, former head chef of Mugaritz in Spain, runs Brae on a 30-acre property with lush organic gardens. Meanwhile, renowned Bondi Beach chef Sean Moran and partner Michael Robertson now run the view-blessed restaurant at Mount Tomah Botanic Gardens in the majestic Blue Mountains, using produce from their own farm. A dish at Brae A chef magnet Heston Blumenthal has done it, with Dinner by Heston in Melbourne. London’s Jason Atherton is doing it with Kensington Street Social in Sydney, and Thai food authority David Thompson is returning to Australia to do it, with Thai street food diner Long Chim in Perth and Sydney. Even Rene Redzepi of Copenhagen’s Noma, is doing it in Sydney for a 10-week pop-up in January, 2016. Suddenly, it seems, the most famous chefs in the world want to be in Australia. Hooked on fish They call it “the ultimate fish”, its snow-white flesh having the texture and richness of deep-sea scallop. Once endangered, Patagonian toothfish caught in the pristine waters of Heard Island, is now certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council. Dubbed Glacier 51, it is served at Queensland’s The Fish House, in Burleigh Heads, and Sake Brisbane, as well as Rockpool Bar & Grill in Perth. Etihad Airways, voted the World’s Leading Airline at the World Travel Awards, offers flights from London, Manchester and Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth from £651 per person.
