The woods are full of gold, red and yellow. Since schools are in session, family travel to historic sites will be over. Accommodations are more available; traffic, for those who choose to drive, less off-putting. Recently, the remains of four of the first English-speaking settlers in the New World were discovered at Jamestown. All had been buried on the site of the church where the Powhatan princess Pocahontas was married to colonist and tobacco-grower John Rolfe. The four were important figures in the Jamestown settlement. One was the first Anglican minister in the New World. Another was Capt. Gabriel Archer, believed to have vied with Captain John Smith for leadership of the 109 English settlers who struggled to make Jamestown their home. The third and fourth were related to Virginia’s first governor. Of particular interest to archaeologists have been some of the possessions buried with Captain Archer — a silver box believed to have been a Roman Catholic reliquary containing bone fragments and a flask that once held holy water. These suggest that the captain was a Roman Catholic in a group of Anglican settlers. For more than 20 years, archaeologists have been making many unexpected discoveries on the site of the original fort the settlers built at what today is called Historic Jamestowne. It was long thought that the fort had been washed away by tides, but digging since 1994 has brought to light European buttons and beads, salt-glazed stoneware, porcelain from China and France, Italy and Holland, breastplates, arms, tools and glassware that had come from England with the colonists. Visitors may see not only these artifacts, but the ongoing unearthing of 17th-century coins and shards. At the Jamestown Settlement Living History Museum nearby they can learn how the colonists’ journey was financed by the Virginia Company of London, a stock company whose investors hoped that, in the New World, the settlers they had sent would find valuable raw materials to make finished goods in England. Travelers can visit replicas of the three ships — the Susan Constant, the Godspeed and the Discovery — that, with 104 men and boys on board, made the initial five-month, 6,000-mile journey. At the museum, visitors can also explore a recreated Powhatan village and enter a re-creation of the original Jamestown fort. It was built after a Native American attack that killed two colonists. Once they had their fort, the remaining Colonists had stayed on. In the winter of 1609-10, a particularly brutal one, the Native Americans relentlessly attacked the fort, and by the time spring arrived, only 60 of the original 104 settlers remained. When ships from England arrived with new colonists, as well as food to restock the fort's diminished larder, the remaining colonists were determined to depart. But they were returned to the fort, along with the newcomers. This time, there were women in the group, and the first Colonial settlement in the New World seriously began. Page 2 of 4 - About 10 miles down the tree-lined Colonial Parkway, which is at its best in the fall, is Colonial Williamsburg, the 18th-century Virginia capital. Its restoration was begun in 1926 by John D. Rockefeller Jr., husband of Rhode Island-born Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. On the picturesque streets of Colonial Williamsburg are 55 restored or repaired red brick and white clapboard Colonial buildings as well as others reconstructed on foundations from the period. Twenty-five of Williamsburg’s buildings may be visited. In some, docents dressed as tailors and coopers, silversmiths, blacksmiths and wigmakers demonstrate those trades. Many of these shops, along with taverns and colorful gardens, line Duke of Gloucester Street, Williamsburg's main street in its early days. The street is also the site of both the graceful capitol building and the governor’s palace. A bit off the main street is Bassett Hall, the white clapboard, 18th-century house the Rockefellers occupied when they were in Williamsburg. It is open to the public and filled with family heirlooms. They include antique ladderback chairs bought by Mrs. Rockefeller and her sister, Lucy Aldrich, and a chest that was painted as a wedding present for the Rockefellers by Abby’s brother, Stuart Aldrich. There are also favorite pieces of American folk art collected by Abby. In addition to those in the house, other folk art items collected by Abby — paintings, cigar store Indians, whirligigs, coverlets and quilts and shop signs — are displayed in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum. It's housed — along with the DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum — in Williamsburg’s old Public Hospital building. The College of William & Mary, founded in 1636, also in Colonial Williamsburg, is, after Harvard, the oldest college in the country. In 1776, students there founded Phi Beta Kappa, the national honor society. It was at a meeting of Phi Beta Kappa in New York City that the Rev. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of a Williamsburg church, met John D. Rockefeller Jr. In time, he convinced him to invest in the preservation of Williamsburg Nearby in Newport News is the Mariners’ Museum, the national maritime museum. Visitors can climb aboard a full-scale replica of the ironclad USS Monitor, the famed Union boat of Civil War fame. It was at Hampton Roads, Virginia, that the Battle of Ironclads took place between the Monitor and the Confederacy’s steam frigate the Virginia, originally the USS Merrimack. Just after the outbreak of the Civil War, the Merrimack was scuttled by the Union, but it was salvaged by the South and rebuilt with an iron-plated hull and re-christened the Virginia. In March 1862, the two ironclads met and fought, but neither won the day. A film at the museum tells the full story of the ships’ encounter. Admirers of hand-crafted ship models will also find an outstanding collection made by Winifred and August F. Crabtree at the museum. Page 3 of 4 - Portsmouth, also worth a visit, is just 29 miles away. It was in Portsmouth's 18th-century Gosport Navy Yard that the largely destroyed Merrimack was restored. Tour guides in breeches and tri-cornered hats also show off Colonial, Federal, Greek Revival, Georgian and Victorian homes. And there is also the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and the Virginia Children’s Museum worth visiting. As many as 180,000 visitors a year come to see that museum’s model railroad collection and its many hands-on exhibits for children of all ages. Finally, on a visit to coastal Virginia, there is Yorktown, 14 miles from Williamsburg. It is small and walkable (or there are Segways that may be rented) or free buses to historic highpoints. It was in Yorktown on Oct. 19, 1781, that Lord Charles Cornwallis, the commander of British troops during the Revolution, said he was ill and sent a lieutenant to surrender to Gen. George Washington. Washington, miffed that Cornwallis himself had not come, designated one of his lieutenants to accept the surrender, and the Revolutionary War was ended. Yorktown is a pretty town, even though it has only a handful of historic houses. There is a pleasant beach, the Watermen’s Museum full of memorabilia of the watermen who piloted the ships of the French fleet that was so important in defeating the British at Yorktown. Among the town's highlights is the marble Yorktown Victory Monument that rises on a hill overlooking the York River. Inscribed on its sides are the story of Cornwallis being holed up in the town, the Colonists' alliance with France, and an account of the surrender. Visitors can also go to the Yorktown Surrender Field and the Yorktown Victory Center. The center holds a museum that holds reproductions of a military encampment and of a 1780s farm. Among items that may be viewed is a diary of a Rhode Island soldier who fought at Yorktown. If you go ... Portsmouth is a good central location from which to explore coastal Virginia. For those wishing to fly, the Norfolk International Airport is only 11 miles from Portsmouth. Southwest flies from Providence to Norfolk with a change over in Baltimore. For those who prefer land travel, Amtrak has rail service leaving Providence daily, arriving in Norfolk in the evening, via a brief bus connection from Newport News. The roundtrip senior train fare after Labor Day can be as low as $181. Since there is no public transportation linking the historic communities of coastal Virginia, it is best to rent a car once you have arrived in Norfolk or Portsmouth.
