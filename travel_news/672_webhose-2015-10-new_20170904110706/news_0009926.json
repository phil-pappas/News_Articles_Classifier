By James Masters, for CNN Updated 1518 GMT (2218 HKT) October 5, 2015 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best New Cruise Ship: Viking Star, Viking Ocean Cruises – Viking Star takes on the charm of a boutique hotel -- homely and comfortable after a long day exploring in port. In fact, the ship is so beautifully designed -- with terrific alfresco restaurants, a beautiful pool area, a superb spa and the two-level Explorers' observation lounge -- you'll be tempted not to go ashore. Hide Caption 1 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best Shore Excursions: Azamara Club Cruises – Besides being able to visit less-trafficked ports, Azamara wins points for its range of shore excursions that include small-group cultural experiences and overnight stops. Hide Caption 2 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best for Adventure: Un-Cruise Adventures – While most expedition cruise lines take you to far-flung destinations, not all of them give you the means to actually get off the ship and hike, kayak, stand-up paddleboard and snorkel. Un-Cruise does all this in Alaska, Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest, Baja Mexico and (next year) Costa Rica and the Galapagos while still providing luxuries like massages and free wine and beer. Hide Caption 3 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best Entertainment: Royal Caribbean International – The entertainment on Royal Caribbean is second to none, whether you're sailing one of the line's smaller ships, where the atrium is transformed into a showcase for aerial performers and acrobats, or journeying on an Oasis- or Quantum-class ship with their Broadway-style theater shows and phenomenal Two70 multisensory spectacles. Hide Caption 4 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best Suites: Royal Caribbean International – The variety and quantity of suites on all Royal Caribbean ships -- as well as an extensive list of suite perks -- are what make the line tops for people who want more space and special treatment. Notable standouts include the two-bedroom AquaTheater suites on Oasis of the Seas and Allure of the Seas and two-level Loft Suites on Oasis- and Quantum-class ships. Hide Caption 5 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best New River Ship: S. S. Maria Theresa, Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection – Named for royalty, Uniworld's S.S. Maria Theresa is regal in its opulent 18th-century decor, a floating homage to the former Austrian empress. Besides indulgent dining and an elegant atmosphere, this is one of the prettiest ships out there. Hide Caption 6 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best River Cruise Line: Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection – With the launch of S.S. Maria Theresa, following 2014's S.S. Catherine, Uniworld has proven its new-builds are the most beautiful and lavish in river cruising. Each of the line's ships is unique -- not just in decor and style but in features and layout. Uniworld also forges new itineraries, adding Bordeaux last year and India's Ganges in 2016. Hide Caption 7 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best Dining: Celebrity Cruises – A sponsor of foodie events such as Diner en Blanc and the South Beach Food and Wine Festival -- not to mention a partnership with TV show \"Top Chef\" -- Celebrity keeps up with gourmet trends. In 2015, it raised the bar by adding restaurant Luminae for suite passengers, while still keeping the standards of its main dining rooms high. Hide Caption 8 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best Value-for-Money (River): Emerald Waterways – Available in Europe, Emerald Waterways packs a lot of inclusions, such as complimentary shore excursions and transfers, prepaid gratuities and free beverages (including wine and beer at lunch and dinner) at a lower price. Other innovations include an indoor pool, which transforms into a movie theater at night and, in some cabins, a floor-to-ceiling window that drops down halfway. Hide Caption 9 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Ship shape – Fancy popping over to Europe and boarding a cruise from the UK? Well, here are the best ships to book onto according to the folks at CruiseCritic.co.uk. They also gave out their awards for 2015 Monday -- and there's plenty of style and swagger sailing around. Hide Caption 10 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best Itineraries: Fred Olsen – Fred Olsen came out on top in the UK category of best itineraries -- and that's no real surprise given they offer cruises up rivers like the Amazon and Guadalquivir. The Black Watch ship offers the 107-night world cruise that heads to New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Peru, Chile, the Caribbean and Sri Lanka to name a few. Hide Caption 11 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best for Luxury: Crystal Cruises – When it comes to luxury, it looks like Crystal Cruises has it covered and the UK judges agree too. Crystal has the highest passenger-to-staff ratio in the industry and even has an ongoing partnership with Michelin-star chef Nobu Matsuhisa. Hide Caption 12 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best for Adventure: Hurtigruten – Dog sledding with huskies, sleeping in an ice hotel, Ski-Doo tours -- what's not to like? Hurtigruten takes you to the High Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica. Hide Caption 13 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best Shore Excursions: Azamara – For the best shore excursions, it's little wonder that Azamara came out on top in the UK section. There aren't many lines that will hire a Cathedral for their passengers, sponsor a private concert, rope off a volcano or get VIP tickets for the Monaco Grand Prix. Hide Caption 14 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best for Families: Royal Caribbean – Royal Caribbean leads the way for family fun with activities for all ages. Standouts include the line's DreamWorks tie-up, featuring parades, characters and exclusive screenings of new movies. There's also a thoughtful range of family cabins and outstanding facilities program for kids, tweens, teens and young adults. Hide Caption 15 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best New Ship: P&O Cruises' Britannia – It's the biggest ship ever built for the UK market -- and it's making an even bigger splash. It's got outstanding dining, sophisticated decor and design and includes all of the line's most popular bars and clubs. Hide Caption 16 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best Entertainment: Royal Caribbean – It's a combination of West End transfers, such as 'We Will Rock You' (on Anthem of the Seas) and 'Mamma Mia!' (on Allure of the Seas), plus the DreamWorks partnership that secures Royal Caribbean this award. The line has always raised the bar high, but the robot dance shows in Cafe 270 on Anthem and Quantum of the Seas take the standard to a new level. Hide Caption 17 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best New River Ship: CroisiEurope's Loire Princesse – The Loire Princesse, the sole cruise ship on the Loire, oozes style as it glides down France's longest river. The ship's astonishingly efficient dual-paddlewheel design -- which gives the 90-metre-long ship a draft of just 80 centimeters -- has allowed CroisiEurope to be the first to conquer France's last \"wild\" river. Hide Caption 18 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best River Cruise Line for Cabins: Sanctuary Retreats – Sanctuary Retreats is making a real splash with some of the most decadent cabins in the business. With six river ships in exotic locations -- China, Egypt and Myanmar -- luxury cruise operator Sanctuary Retreats has made a big impression this year. Sanctuary Ananda's 21 cabins, for example, average more than 300 square feet in size, and all have balconies. Hide Caption 19 of 20 20 photos: U.S. Cruise Critic Editors' Picks Awards Best River Cruise line for Shore Excursions: Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection – Uniworld caught the attention of editors for its shore excursions, which offer a mix of active and behind-the-scene opportunities. Excursions are rated by activity level, so there's something for everyone -- including camel riding.
