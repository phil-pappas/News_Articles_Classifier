Aspri Spirits presents the renowned wine from South Africa, Two Oceans, to celebrate the festive season.\nAbout Two Oceans\nTwo Oceans was launched internationally in 1993 and is available in more than 80 countries. Two Oceans gets its name from the two great oceans – The warm Indian and the cold Atlantic Ocean that converge at the southern coast of Africa. The cold, refreshing waves of the Atlantic Ocean collide with the warm, inviting waters of the Indian Ocean creating a unique micro climate .The Cape region enjoys a temperate climate, cooled by daytime maritime breeze and a drop in the night time temperature that allow the grapes to ripen slowly and allow the wine to develop the fruit flavours.\nTwo Oceans Sauvignon Blanc – Crisp, fresh and elegant with upfront tropical fruit, tangy gooseberry, a hint of green fig and fresh-cut grass. This wine has become a favorite in 80 countries.\nTwo Oceans Pinotage – With a glorious colour of rose petals, an aroma of ripe berries and a tangy, fruity taste, it’s easy to drink and food friendly. Enjoy the wine lightly chilled and pair it with salmon, prawns, salads, pasta, poultry and soft creamy cheeses.\nTwo Oceans Shiraz -Dark red with purple edges, it grand colours make you think of royal regalia. You’ll pick up vibrant cherry and plum characters and a slightly smoky note too. Rich and ripe berry flavours meet a sprinkling of pepper.
