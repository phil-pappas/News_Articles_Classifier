The hotel has seen an increase in business from all of its core markets, resulting in growth of 16% year on year.\nAs The Link Hotel looks to build on this success, the property has re-positioned its branding to focus on its locality and outstanding customer service.\nEmma Boynton, Head of Sales and Marketing at imago, commented: “Many of the hotels in the area are focused on specific markets, such as conferences or leisure guests. So there was a real opportunity to reposition The Link Hotel and focus on its unique selling points to maintain the sales growth we have been achieving year on year.\n“As part of our customer journey, we actively engaged with guests to seek their views on what was important to them and their feedback has been integrated into our business strategy. The Link Hotel is a highly versatile property and offers guests – whether they are travelling around the country on business or are visitors to Loughborough University – all the facilities they need for a comfortable stay and we hope to see its growth continue as we reposition it in the local marketplace.”\nThe Link Hotel is situated half a mile from the M1 making it easy to reach by road, rail and air. Its meetings facilities include six training and meeting rooms and break out areas – all of which have high speed Wi-Fi access – with a capacity of 200 people, as well as 94 en-suite bedrooms, lounge, bar and dining facilities.\n \nSource:- Link Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:37:11.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
