If a passenger was on that flight, what would the pilots and cabin crew be doing behind the scenes, what would the passengers be asked to do and what survival tips are there in the event of a crash?\nScroll down for video\nA steward demonstrates emergency measures on aeroplane in case of an emergency\nAn engine from a Mahan Air Boeing 747 aircraft fell off two minutes into a flight this week. It was carrying 300 people\nFirst of all, passengers should feel confident that they are in the safest of hands when it comes to crew and emergencies - staff go through incredibly rigorous training schedules that last for days to prepare for any type of disaster.\nPilots are the first to react when it comes to an emergency and how they behave is governed by the type of situation.\n 2 Next Peats and beats on Islay: Experiencing 'the Queen of the...

For instance, according to the Captain Ken Hoke, who is a Boeing 757/767 captain, if an engine failed immediately after take-off, the pilot would announce an emergency over the microphone to cabin crew and Air Traffic Control.\nHe told website flightradar24.com : 'In this situation, the crew knows they have a serious problem and will need the immediate assistance and cooperation of Air Traffic Control to assure a successful outcome.'\nThe view from a Boeing 747 cockpit. In an emergency, the pilots have a strict procedure to follow to deal with almost every situation\nHe continued: '[But] in most “emergencies,” we aren’t in a big hurry. Unless it’s smoke, fire, or low on fuel, we can usually take our time to evaluate the problem.'\nThe type of language used by the pilot helps the cabin crew to decipher how extreme the emergency is very easily.\nFor example, on American flights, a crew will determine how important and emergency is depending on whether it is 'urgent' or 'distressed.'\nAn urgent situation is a problem that needs assistance but not necessarily immediately, whereas a 'distressed' situation means the flight is in immediate or imminent danger and the situation needs to be addressed straight away.\nOn flights outside of the US, the phrase 'Pan-Pan' is used to describe an urgent situation, while 'Mayday' is used to describe a distressed one.\nIn an emergency, a pilot will radio to Air Traffic Control to notify them of the issue\nAccording to Captain Hoke, the pilot will also reset their transponder - a device for receiving and transmitting radio signals - to the emergency code of 7700 (squawking 7700) in an emergency situation to notify ground control.\nHe said: 'If a crew resets their transponder to the emergency code of 7700 (squawking 7700), all air traffic control facilities in the area are immediately alerted that the aircraft has an emergency situation. It’s up to the crew to let ATC know what the exact situation is.'\nOnce this has been done, the air traffic control will make this aircraft the priority in the sky and will even redirect other aircraft out of the way if necessary to bring the plane to safety.\nWhile the pilot is busy attempting to land the plane safely, the cabin crew will be preparing the passengers.\nA Fokker 100 airplane makes an emergency landing on the tarmac of Stuttgart's airport in 2009\nIn some instances, passengers won't even be made aware that something has gone wrong, for example - if there is a small fire on the plane in the galley, they may not be notified.\nFor a large fire, cabin crew are given gas masks so that they are not affected by smoke and can help passengers, who don't have gas masks, to safety.\nOnce the plane has landed, cabin crew are stationed at the emergency exits to help passengers get out of the plane on the inflatable slides.\nThey are tasked with using everything in their power to get people onto the slides, including pushing them and kicking them if necessary, as time is of the essence and many passengers freeze when faced with the almost vertical slides.\nAccording to The Telegraph : 'It is their responsibility to get people out, and there is no time to accommodate those with vertigo. At full pelt, 150 people can be off in 60 seconds.'\nCabin crew learn how to man an emergency slide at the safety school at the Virgin Atlantic Training Base in London\nIf the landing is on water, which is only undertaken if there are no other possible options, cabin crew may advise passengers to put on extra clothing to keep them warmer in the water.\nOnce all of the passengers are off the plane, the inflatable slides are detached and they are used as floating rafts.\nBut while much of the responsibility lies with the cabin crew and pilots when it comes to an emergency, there are also several things that passengers should so to enhance their chances of survival.\nOften, aeroplane passengers tend to follow the 'ignorance is bliss' rule when flying, but in fact, the opposite attitude should be taken.\nThe following guide details what someone should do in order to be prepared in a plane emergency.\nHOW TO BE PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY ON A PLANE Be prepared during take-off and landing:\nTake off and landing are the two most likely times for a plane to get into trouble, specifically, the three minutes after take-off and the eight minutes before landing.\nThere are several things that you can do during this time to make sure that you are best prepared for trouble.\nThe simplest of these are staying sober and awake! Often people like to celebrate a holiday with a few drinks at the airport bar before boarding, but this will not help if you need to be alert in an emergency, the same applies to sneaking in a nap as soon as you get into your seat.\nPassengers should always try to stay awake during take-off and landing (picture posed by models)\nOnce in your seat, avoid the temptation to remove your shoes - if the plane suddenly gets into trouble, it will be very difficult to put them back on before evacuation.\nShoes can be removed once the plane has finished take-off and should be put on before landing starts.\nWomen should also avoid high heels when flying.\nRead the safety card and listen to the cabin crew demonstration:\nNo matter how many times you have flown before, it is advisable to listen to the safety demonstrations - in case of an emergency, what you think you remember can easily be forgotten in the heat of the moment and speed is of the essence.\nJust to highlight the importance of speed during an emergency, airfarewatchdog recently revealed that passengers have just 15 seconds to put on an air mask before the brain starts to be affected by lack of oxygen.\nThe site said in an article: 'You might only have 15 or 20 seconds in the event of a cabin decompression, during which all oxygen would be sucked out of the plane, before you’d experience confusion and a euphoric “stoned” state, at which point you might forget everything you heard during the safety demo.\n'In 30 to 45 seconds you'd probably pass out. So it’s important to act quickly.'\nThe website also revealed that passengers can even forget how to remove their seat belt when panicked and tend to try and release it in the same way that they would in a car.\nLook for the emergency doors:\nIn case of an emergency landing there is likely to be no light on in the plane and it may also be filled with smoke is there is a fire.\nFor this reason, it is always a good idea to check where the emergency doors are in advance.\nAccording to aviation safety expert Professor Ed Galea from the University of Greenwich, it is also a good idea to count the number of seat rows from your seat to the nearest exit.\nHe told the BBC: 'I count the seat rows from my seating position to the exit.\n'So in the event of smoke or if emergency lighting fails and it's very dark, I know the number of seat rows and I can feel my way to an exit. By counting the seat backs I'll know when I've reached the exit row.'\nWithout you even knowing it, your eyes are being accustomed in case of smoke and bad lighting during take-off and landing when the lights are dimmed by cabin crew.\nIt is always important to locate your nearest emergency door when on a plane\nIf you are lucky enough to be sitting next to the emergency exit, make sure that you are strong enough to open and throw the door if something happens - according to airfarewatchdog, on a Boeing 737 the emergency door weighs 40lbs.\nTime is of the essence:\nIn a real emergency, there is extremely little time for passengers to make a safe escape - 90 to 120 seconds to be precise.\nIn the instance of a fire, there may be even less time as the smoke will choke passengers - it only takes three lungfuls of toxic fumes for a person to become unconscious.\nAccording to The Telegraph, during the 'golden period' of 90 seconds, passengers should: 'Move fast. Listen to flight attendants, get to an exit fast, check quickly that it is viable, inside and out, then get out and move as far from the plane as fast as possible.'\nLeave your bags behind:\nBecause time is of the essence, the last thing passengers should do in an emergency is waste time by rooting around in the overhead cabins for their personal possessions - not only will you block the alleyway for others but you are risking your own life.\nOn top of this, it is inadvisable to take any bags with you while using the emergency inflatable slides.\nAccording to Patrick Smith from the blog AskThePilot : 'T hose slides are extremely steep. They are not designed for convenience; they are designed to empty a plane of its occupants as rapidly as possible.\n'You’ll be coming down from two stories high in the case of a 777, at a very rapid clip, with others doing the same in front of you and right behind you.\n'Even without bags people are often injured using the slides. Add luggage to the mix and somebody is liable to be killed.'\nRead more: The things they don't tell you in the safety demo - Blog - Airfarewatchdog BBC NEWS | Magazine | How to survive a plane crash How to survive a plane crash - Telegraph Deadly Stupidity: What NOT To Do in an Emergency Squawking 7700—In-flight Emergencies from a Pilot’s Perspective | Flightradar24 Blog Video: How to handle an in-flight emergency - Telegraph", "external_links": ["http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5402342.stm", "http://www.askthepilot.com/emergency-etiquette/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://dailym.ai/1ReRTIE", "http://www.flightradar24.com/blog/squawking-7700-in-flight-emergencies-from-a-pilots-perspective/", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelvideo/10892201/How-to-handle-an-in-flight-emergency.html", "http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/blog/13832148/the-things-they-don-tell-you-in-the-safety-demo/", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/4269453/How-to-survive-a-plane-crash.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:12:10.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
