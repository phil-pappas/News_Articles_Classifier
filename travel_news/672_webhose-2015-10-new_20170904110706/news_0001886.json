But if you could have seen his smirk and heard his chuckle, you would have known that he was teaching us kids a valuable lesson, in his light-hearted way, whenever we would experience life’s little frustrations.\nHis point was simple: Life is never ideal. And it never will be. There will always be frustrations and things to complain about. And if you focus on only these things, you will come to the end of your life and realize you never really lived.\nI smile when I think about him saying this because it’s deeply affected my perspective on life. I have learned to shrug things off when they’re not perfect and to work with what I’m given rather than wish for something different.\nThat can be a helpful perspective when it comes to your wardrobe and appearance. I would venture to guess that few of you think you have an ideal appearance, wardrobe or budget for new clothes. So it can be frustrating to read fashion advice or check out the newest trends, because it’s hard to see how you could make them work.\nYou may be in the process of losing weight. You may be pregnant or postpartum. You may be “over the hill.” You may have a medical condition that significantly affects your wardrobe choices or style.\nI’m with you, and I want to offer some tips for how to proceed when your circumstances are less than ideal.\n1. Face reality and accept it . You may not be at your ideal weight or have your ideal appearance. I don’t mean to say that you should stop striving for your ideal or your physical fitness goals, but you have to wake up in the morning and get dressed in the body that you have today.\nSo take a look at it. Seriously! Look at your body. Accepting your body for what it is can be the hardest part, but only then will you be able to adorn it appropriately.\n2. Accentuate your favorite feature . Don’t pick a feature that fits within cultural standards of beauty or think about what other people might like about you. Ask yourself what your favorite part of your appearance is. Is it your hair? Eyes? Hands? Back?\nMy favorite features are my hair and my collarbone. Weird, I know. But knowing this helps me dress in a way that inspires my confidence. I like boat neck or V-neck shirts so I can see my neckline, and I love colors that either perfectly match or strikingly contrast my hair color.\nOnce you choose your favorite feature, you can focus on ways to accent and emphasize that part of you.\nIf you love your toes and love painting your toenails, you should wear sandals and peep-toe pumps. If you love your wrists and hands, you should wear 3/4-sleeve or bracelet-length tops and stock up on bracelets to draw attention to your favorite feature.\nYou’ll be surprised at how your confidence rises when you use your favorite feature as the anchor for your outfit or appearance.\n3. Choose your least favorite feature(s) and camouflage it . I don’t like my knees, eyelashes, eyebrows or my large head. Some of the things we don’t like about ourselves can be fixed with makeup or other cosmetic adjustments, but what do we do about the things that aren’t so easily changed? You have to work around them.\nInstead of wearing shorts, I wear cropped jeans, lightweight pants or dresses because of my weird knees. And instead of pulling my hair into a tight ponytail, I put it up in a loose chignon, or I might wear a cute baseball cap to camouflage my giant noggin.\nIn the eclectic world of fashion, there’s enough freedom for you to skip the trends that don’t accommodate you and choose the trends that let you work around your problem areas.\nMuffin top? Try wearing a peplum-style blouse. Droopy shoulders? Wear structured shirts or jackets with textured or silk bottoms. Pasty white skin? Avoid black unless you pair it with statement jewelry and wear rich, bright colors and bold makeup.\nPlay around with what makes you comfortable, and don’t be afraid to try something new.\n4. Start small and grow from there . Don’t feel compelled to overhaul your entire wardrobe, even if you know it needs it. Start in chunks so you don’t become overwhelmed and discouraged. When you’re struggling with frustrations regarding your body image, the last thing you need is to add more fuel to the fire. Be patient. And most importantly, be content.\nYour body is the vessel you have been given to live your life. You should care for it and adorn it as a valuable possession, but don’t allow the preservation or beautification of your body to become your life’s pursuit. Spend some time picking out jeans that flatter your figure or learning about the best makeup or skincare for your face, and then start chasing what’s really important.\nJoelle Allen is a Briefing columnist, mother of four and co-owner of Naomi Belle Consignments in Dallas.
