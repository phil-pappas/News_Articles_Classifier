SeaWorld wants to greatly expand the tanks it uses to hold killer whales in San Diego but animal rights activists are opposed, saying breeding the animals in captivity is cruel no matter the size of the tanks. A state agency is expected to consider Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, how much regulators should weigh in on the $100 million proposal for the marine-theme park. (AP Photo/Chris Park, File) \nThe 500 people who packed the meeting room included SeaWorld supporters wearing blue and white shirts and holding signs saying, \"Educate, Inspire, Conserve,\" and critics waving signs saying \"Vote no on SeaWorld Tanks\" and \"SeaWorld hurts Orcas.\"\nSome groaned or snickered as staff testimony began.\nOutside, hundreds of people who couldn't get into the meeting room stood behind rope lines and watched the session on oversized screens.\nSeaWorld San Diego President John Reilly told commission members they would hear numerous inaccurate statements from critics but asserted the project would provide a better living environment for the whales and open new windows for researchers.\nNo one is more passionate about caring for killer whales than SeaWorld, he said.\nMatt Bruce of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said the renovations would do nothing to improve conditions for the killer whales.\n\"We feel these newer tanks will just be more prisons for these orcas,\" Bruce said. \"These orcas are robbed of everything that is natural to them.\"\nThe staff of the commission has recommended approving the expansion under nine conditions that include forbidding SeaWorld from housing recently captured orcas in San Diego.\nSeaWorld says it has not collected any orcas in the wild in more than three decades, its animals are well treated and park shows help generate support for conservation.\nUnder the proposal, SeaWorld would demolish portions of a 1995 facility that included a 1.7-million gallon pool and replace it with a 5.2-million gallon tank and 450,000-gallon pool.\nThe Orlando, Florida-based company has said the orca population at the San Diego facility — which currently numbers 11 — would not significantly increase due to the \"Blue World\" project it wants to open in 2018, even though the capacity of the tanks would jump.\nThe panel said it had received some 200,000 emails and 50,000 postcards weighing in on the project.\nAttendance at the California park has declined since the release of the population documentary \"Blackfish\" in 2013, which suggests SeaWorld's treatment of captive orcas provokes violent behaviour. The company's stock price also has dropped over the past two years.\nThe testimony from each side depicted sharply different conditions for the whales — one caring and nurturing, the other harsh and heartless.\nJohn Hargrove, a former SeaWorld trainer in California and Texas who has written a book about his experiences and appeared in the \"Blackfish\" film, said whales are heavily medicated and family structures that define life in the wild are broken.\nThe whales gnaw the edges of their pools, breaking or wearing teeth, and inbreeding has created \"hybrid orcas who have no true social identity,\" he said.\nBut SeaWorld veterinarian Hendrik Nollens disputed what he called \"outlandish accusations\" from critics of the park. The whales are enriched and stimulated, he said, not stressed or depressed.\n\"We care for these animals as if they were family,\" Nollens told the panel. \"We have nothing but the whales' best interest at heart.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:34:24.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
