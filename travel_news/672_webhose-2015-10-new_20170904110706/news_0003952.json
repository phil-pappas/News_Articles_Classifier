This time of the year is a wonderful time of year to visit this enchanting city. Here’s why. \nIf you’re looking for a different way to spend the festive season, why not spend Christmas in Prague? Why Prague?One of the things that people in central and eastern Europe have always been good at is a Christmas fair. Other countries like the UK used to be the same, but the tradition has been lost along the way – perhaps because the traditional grey, wet and blustery Christmas weather doesn’t really create the right atmosphere.In contrast, Christmas in Prague is usually icy cold but very clear – so is ideal for street fairs and the famous Christmas markets. There’s nothing more magical than wandering the ancient streets, exploring beautifully illuminated stalls, and partaking in a glass of mulled wine at the same time!The atmosphere in these markets is really half the fun but you might also find a bargain or an unusual Christmas or New Year gift. The foodstuffs are, as you might imagine, fabulous as well; don’t forget to try the rich, flaky pastries and if you like mouth-watering (but perhaps not entirely waistline-friendly) hot sausages, then you’ll love the ones available at these markets.In reality, the sheer magic of the atmosphere means you can get just as much enjoyment strolling around without spending a penny. The markets operate most of December in the Old Town Square and Wenceslas Square. Sights and AttractionsOf course, spending Christmas in Prague isn’t just about going shopping and eating. The city-centre (or very nearby) attractions are legendary, and include Prague Castle, the Old Royal Palace, Golden Lane, Saint George’s Basilica and Saint Vitus’ Cathedral.A walk around the old Jewish Quarter is poignant and well worth the effort.Another lovely experience is a boat cruise along the river. It’s arguably the best way to see some of the major city sights and it can, if you wish, include lunch. It’s also possible to take a tour of Prague’s pubs and sample some of the local beers, and you can even combine it with a late-night 'ghost tour' of the famous Prague Castle. If you have the time, in the areas immediately surrounding Prague you’ll find a host of spectacular sights, including other castles and mansions that can offer an interesting insight into the history of Bohemia and its people.All the attractions mentioned above are open leading up to Christmas in Prague - unlike in some countries, isn’t usually a time for shutdowns. Even so, do be aware that some locations do either close or have limited services on Christmas Eve or Christmas day itself. So, if you’re planning to spend Christmas in Prague but have some very specific sights on your ‘must see’ list, you certainly should check in advance that they’ll be open at the time you plan to visit.All in all, spending this time of the year in a city as traditional and beautiful as Prague can make for a memory to last a lifetime.   \nLukas Johannes is a driver for Shuttle Direct.
