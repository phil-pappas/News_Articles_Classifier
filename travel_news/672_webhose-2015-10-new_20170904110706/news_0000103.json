PETERSBURG, Fla., Sept. 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Squaremouth , a leading travel insurance comparison website headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida , has been named No. 2 on the list of 100 Best Workplaces for Women by Fortune and Great Place to Work. Other companies on the list include Edward Jones (No. 31), Marriott International (No. 81), L.L.Bean (No. 84), and Yelp (No. 93).\nThe rankings are based on evaluations by over 277,000 employees on Great Place to Work's annual employee survey. This is the inaugural year of the list, after the survey found that women often differed from men in the areas of fairness, communication and involvement in decision-making. Squaremouth and the other top companies were selected for promoting equal and inclusive environments for both genders.\n\"Fairness is inherent to our operations. Our culture is nontraditional in that we are extremely transparent and collaborative, which naturally promotes equality,\" CEO Chris Harvey said of Squaremouth, where women make up 52 percent of the workforce and 57 percent of management. \"There are no secrets, and decision-making is a group effort.\"\nEvery employee at Squaremouth, regardless of role or gender, has a say in major company decisions. This process of continuous open communication ensures every employee has equal opportunity to contribute to and understand the direction of the company.\nSquaremouth's raise process also ensures fairness. Any employee can request a raise at any time, which is put to a company vote. This removes any stigma attached to asking for a raise. While studies show that women are typically less likely to ask for a raise than men, 57 percent of the approved raise requests at Squaremouth in the past two years were those of women. To ensure every employee is equally rewarded for their hard work, Squaremouth also provides a quarterly bonus based on the employee's salary.\n\"The playing field is completely equal,\" said Squaremouth Project Management Director Megan Singh , who began her tenure at Squaremouth two years ago as Marketing Manager. \"No matter your job title or gender, everyone is given the same opportunities and support, which gives us all a shared feeling of contribution to Squaremouth's success.\"\nSquaremouth's approach has been working for the company, which has been consistently recognized for its unique company culture and rapid growth. Earlier this year, the company was named one of the 50 fastest growing companies in Tampa Bay for the fourth year in a row by the Tampa Bay Business Journal. Squaremouth has also been recognized as one of America's fastest growing companies by Inc.
