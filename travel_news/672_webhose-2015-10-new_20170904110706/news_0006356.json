Calderón Guardia’s medical officials reported Cruz’s current condition as “still critical.”\nCruz has one child and his wife Carolina Zúñiga is five months pregnant. He is currently in the hospital’s intensive care unit, while various relatives remain outside the medical center awaiting updates.\nGroups of protesters remained in front of the hospital Thursday afternoon and called the population through social media to attend at least two public demonstrations and vigils in downtown San José on Thursday and over the weekend.\nPolice say they can’t confirm whether the attack on Cruz was related to the filming incident. They have no suspects yet.\nTico Times photographer Alberto Font contributed to this story.\nContact L.
