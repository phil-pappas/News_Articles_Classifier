Based largely on an iconic film, celebrating its 30 th anniversary today, in which a trash-fueled car transports its two stars back in history and into the future, Toyota's \"Fueled by the Future\" campaign focuses on its new hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicle, the Mirai, and the technology used to fuel the vehicle today, which is a technology field largely led around the world by Air Products.\nThe Toyota video released today is timed to the exact date set on the time machine in the original movie, as well as the Mirai on-sale date, and shows that the concept behind the mythical trash-powered car is already a reality today thanks to the innovation of companies like Air Products and Toyota.\nRecreating many familiar scenes from the movie, Toyota's \"Fueled by the Future\" video explains how companies like Air Products are turning trash into hydrogen to fuel cell cars like the new Mirai. A second video, \"Behind the Science,\" was created to explain the technology in a little more detail. Both videos show an Air Products steam methane reformer, which produces large-scale quantities of hydrogen, as well as an Air Products SmartFuel Â® hydrogen fueling station for filling vehicles. While Air Products' appearances in the videos are brief, the company's role in hydrogen production and dispensing technology is a key component of the success of hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles. The videos can be viewed at https://ssl.toyota.com/mirai/fueledbyeverything.html .\n\"Hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicles are hitting the nation's roads now, and thousands more are on the way as automobile manufacturers are initially targeting the California market,\" said Ed Kiczek , Air Products' global business director?Hydrogen Energy Systems. \"Air Products is excited about the critical role we play in providing the fueling infrastructure required to support both today's hydrogen-powered vehicles and the major vehicle rollout expected over the next year. It is a privilege to collaborate with Toyota on this promising technology, which is making an impact by reducing pollution and increasing energy security.\"\nIn California , Air Products is supplying fueling stations with hydrogen made from eligible renewable sources. In compliance with California's hydrogen infrastructure program, at least 33% of the hydrogen dispensed at the company's automotive fueling stations in the state is renewable.\nAir Products has developed, and successfully demonstrated, other renewable production technologies that can produce hydrogen, including one such project that converted biogas from municipal wastewater to hydrogen. Feedstock sources such as agricultural, food and brewery wastes, in addition to landfill gas, all contain hydrogen and can be used to produce renewable fuel. If all of these available streams were converted to hydrogen, they could provide fueling for up to 200 million fuel cell vehicles in the U.S. and point to sustainable energy independence.\nAir Products has taken a leadership position in the development of hydrogen supply and fueling infrastructure-with unparalleled distribution and dispensing capabilities-to enable the successful commercialization of these vehicles around the world. The company's SmartFuel hydrogen fueling stations provide hydrogen fueling at 700 bar (10,000 psi) and include the company's advanced high pressure distribution systems and consumer-friendly retail hydrogen fuel dispenser, which mirrors traditional consumer gasoline fueling and payment practices and is readily available to meet consumer expectations of refilling hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles in a safe, fast, reliable, and familiar manner. Hydrogen for these stations can be delivered to a site via truck or pipeline, produced by natural gas reformation, biomass conversion, or by electrolysis, including electrolysis driven by renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.\nUse of the company's fueling technology is increasing and is already used in conducting approximately 1,000,000 hydrogen fills per year. The company has been involved in over 200 hydrogen fueling projects in the United States and 20 countries worldwide. Cars, trucks, vans, buses, scooters, forklifts, locomotives, planes, cell towers, material handling equipment, and even submarines have been fueled with trend-setting Air Products' technologies.
