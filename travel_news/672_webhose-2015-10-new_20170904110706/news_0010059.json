(Fotolia) \nNiagara region, Ontario: Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake and the Niagara River Parkway are all must-visit areas during autumn. Not only can you sample some of the best wines in Canada in Niagara-on-the-Lake, but you can also view Niagara Falls surrounded by autumn colours or just tour the foliage on the lovely Parkway drive. (Fotolia) \nNew Brunswick: The Fundy Coastal Drive is one of the world's top coastal routes, famed for passing by the tides of the Bay of Fundy and this maritime province's most beautiful natural sites. During the first weeks of October, the drive is alight with autumn colours as leaves change. (Fotolia) \nMuskoka, Ontario: Ontario's prime cottage region is just as lovely in fall when the leaves change colour. Late September to early October is the perfect time to escape to this area.
