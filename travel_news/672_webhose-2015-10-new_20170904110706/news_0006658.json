(NYSE: GM) today announced third-quarter net income to common stockholders of $1.4 billion or $0.84 per diluted share, compared to $1 .4 billion or $0.81 per diluted share a year ago. Improvement in operating performance during the quarter was offset by a net loss from special items.\nEarnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.50 , up 55 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014. Year to date through the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share was $3.63 , up 96 percent compared to the prior year.\nThird quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) adjusted of $3.1 billion and EBIT-adjusted margin of 8.0 percent were both records for any quarter. These compare to EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion and an EBIT-adjusted margin of 5.8 percent in the third quarter of 2014.\n\"These results reflect our work to capitalize on our strengths in the U.S. and China , while taking decisive, proactive steps to mitigate challenges elsewhere,\" said GM CEO Mary Barra . \"GM is a vastly different company today than just five years ago. We're building a strong foundation, driving earnings growth in our core business and executing a plan to lead the future of personal mobility, all with the aim of creating shareholder value for years to come.\"\nNet income to common stockholders includes a net loss from special items of $1.5 billion before tax, or $0.66 per diluted share for the quarter. Special items included $0.9 billion related to a Deferred Prosecution Agreement reached with the U.S. Attorney's Office for matters associated with the ignition switch recall, and approximately $0.6 billion for the settlement of certain civil actions involving 2014 product recalls, including the ignition switch recall.\nNet revenue during the quarter was $38 .8 billion compared to $39.3 billion in the third quarter of 2014. The change in net revenue is more than attributed to a negative net foreign currency exchange impact. Holding exchange rates constant, net revenue was $2.3 billion higher than the third quarter of 2014.\nGM Results Overview (in billions except for per share amounts)\nQ3\n2015\nQ3\n2014\nNet Revenue\n$38.8\n$39.3\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\n$1.4\n$1.4\nEarnings per share (EPS) diluted\n$0.84\n$0.81\nImpact of special items on EPS diluted\n$(0.66)\n$(0.16)\nEPS diluted â€“ adjusted\n$1.50\n$0.97\nEBIT-adjusted\n$3.1\n$2.3\n% EBIT-adjusted margin\n8.0\n5.8\nAutomotive net cash flow from operating activities\n$2.6\n$0.7\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow\n$0.8\n$(0.8)\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) - %\n26.0\n14.0\nSegment EBIT-Adjusted Results\nGM North America reported record levels for EBIT-adjusted of $3.3 billion , EBIT-adjusted margin of 11.8 percent and net revenue of $27.8 billion .
