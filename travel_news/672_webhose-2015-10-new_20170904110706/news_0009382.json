Our activity is focused on ensuring the market is primed and ready to make the most of the services from day one.\n“While we undertake a full marketing programme in Brazil, until now our activity has been more limited in Argentina. Our campaign activity marked the first time we have specifically targeted Argentina travellers and we received some fantastic results with a high click through rate to campaign material.”\nThemed ‘New Zealand is closer than you think’ the campaign ran from 16 August – 7 September. Undertaken online the activity drove traffic directly to the Air New Zealand website with a promotional fare to convert interest into actual travel.\nThe IMA Roadshow saw TNZ turn its attention to engaging with the travel industry, visiting four Latin American cities from 23-27 August.\n“From experience we know that increasing arrival numbers is reliant on a well-educated industry in market. The IMA Roadshow saw us do just that –with the four workshops and two VIP dinners seeing us reach approximately 240 travel agents.”\nVisiting Santiago, Buenos Aires, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro the IMA Roadshow helped to increase travel agent awareness and knowledge of New Zealand and its regions, while also educating attendees on the tools and support available from TNZ. IMA participants from New Zealand included Auckland & Northland; Thermal Explorer Highway; Wellington & Wairarapa; Canterbury & West Coast and Southern Lakes.\n“There is a lot of excitement about the new flight amongst the industry and it was great to see an increase in confidence in selling destination New Zealand as a result of the workshops,’ says Bjoern.\nTNZ again supported Air New Zealand joining them for the first time at the FIT Buenos Aires travel show in Argentina September 26-29. With a focus on general leisure travel the show offered attendance for both travellers and trade and provided yet another opportunity to promote the new Air New Zealand flight.\nThe activity in market will be reinforced in late September when five Argentinian media outlets visit New Zealand to experience the country first hand as part of TNZ’s International Media Programme.\nRepresenting a variety of media, the publications include: Clarín, a major daily newspaper, El Planeta Urbano, a lifestyle magazine, tourism publication Lugares, women’s magazine OHLALÁ!, and a weekly newspaper insert Rumbos. While in New Zealand they will visit Auckland, Rotorua and Queenstown experiencing regional fine wine and food, unique arts and Maori culture and meet some of New Zealand’s rare wildlife.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:36:41.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
