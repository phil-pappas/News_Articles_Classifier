It has become more and more prevalent over the past few years largely due to the constantly improving TV rights deals. “The first set of bookings usually take place just after the fixture lists are announced, as teams plan for the season ahead. Midweek cup ties are the next up, depending on how seriously certain clubs are taking their challenge that season. Champions League games almost always involve chartered aircraft, as it is really the only viable option for games anywhere in Europe. Finally, in the run up to the end of the season in May, teams in the relegation zone and clubs near the top tend to look closer at any ways at all that they can improve the team’s results. “We have already flown more than half this season’s Premier League teams since August. But it is not only the top tier that look into this option – we also have several Championship clubs as clients, as the distances involved in some away games are the same as in the Premier League.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:15:35.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
