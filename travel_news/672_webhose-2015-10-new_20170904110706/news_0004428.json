There is no need for local residents to book a place and all are welcome.\n \nPlans to replace the current level crossing, including removing the current listed gates, were rejected by Lewes District Council’s Planning Committee on 30th September. Unfortunately, by this time other work to upgrade the signalling at the level crossing site had already taken place, meaning that the original level crossing cannot, for safety reasons, be reopened immediately without additional works being undertaken.\n \nSteve Knight, Network Rail Area Director, said: “We are sorry that we are continuing to cause disruption to local residents and the community at Plumpton. Our priority in the short term is to reopen the level crossing in Plumpton as soon as possible; we can only do this when we have safe way to do this that Lewes District Council support. We will be outlining these plans on Friday evening as well as explaining why it is not possible to immediately reinstate the crossing and why the crossing, in its original state poses an unacceptable safety risk.”\n \nMaria Caulfield, Member of Parliament for Lewes said: “It’s important that Network Rail finds a solution to this problem as soon as possible. The residents of Plumpton Green are understandably upset by the disruption caused by the closure and they want answers. Network Rail however has a responsibility to ensure that the crossing at Plumpton is safe for all who use it. I hope the meeting on Friday will give both sides an opportunity to discuss the options available, allowing us to find a solution and reopen the road as soon as possible.”\n \nSource:-Network rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:32:45.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
