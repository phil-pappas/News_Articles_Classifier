Picture: REUTERS ABUJA — Nigerian authorities on Monday filed charges of money laundering against the former national security adviser of former president Goodluck Jonathan, a month after hitting him with arms charges.\nSambo Dasuki, 60, first appeared before a federal high court in the capital Abuja last month on charges of illegal weapons possession but was later released on bail. When his case resumed on Monday, the prosecutors added new charges of \"retention\" and \"concealment\" of \"funds that form part of the proceeds of an unlawful act\". The charges gave no further details.\nNigerian secret police in July raided Mr Dasuki’s homes in Abuja and the northern city of Sokoto after his sacking by President Mohammadu Buhari, who took office in May.\nProsecutors alleged that a cache of arms and ammunition was found during the raids, along with a total of $210,000 and 42.6-million naira ($213,000).\nMr Dasuki, who served as national security adviser for three years starting in June 2012, pleaded not guilty to all the charges.\nThe case was adjourned to Wednesday.\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:10:00.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
