And, if you were in any doubt as to the pedigree of the neighbourhood, it is located among some of the capital’s most desirable addresses and opposite a townhouse apparently owned by Madonna. We were definitely in good company. We were greeted with a very warm welcome on arrival and after taking in the eye-catching decor in the reception area, my weary friend and I could not wait to get into our suite. Promoted stories \nWe were not disappointed. The spectacular Wellbeck Suite comes with a private outdoor terrace, just about enough to tempt us from the beautiful bed. \nWhen we were eventually prised from the suite – only after being lured to the hotel’s Hunter 486 bar – we continued to be impressed. \nDespite its intimate feel, the hotel is surprisingly big. Each of the 82 guest rooms and four suites, however, are completely individual, though with no compromise on quality. \nOn a tour of what it has to offer, we were told the owner designed the hotel to include everything he felt was missing during stays at various hotels across the world. \nEvery bugbear you thought you had about hotels – being charged for soft drinks in your room, the mirror steaming up in the bathroom, not having the right adaptors to charge your phone – have all been addressed and thought through. Travellers from all over the world are catered for. For example, there is no fourth floor, because it is considered an unlucky number in some Asian cultures. \nThe design, meanwhile, really does feed the imagination. It took us a while to figure out what the black and white prints in the corridor formed (I won’t ruin the surprise). \nDespite its boutique and modern feel, it is obvious a lot of care has gone into making sure it is true to its history. \nThe Hunter 486 restaurant, for example, is named after the 1950s dialling code for Marylebone and has an air of nostalgic London glamour with a contemporary touch. It features blown-glass chandeliers, statement artwork and even booths for guests who prefer that extra privacy. \nThere is so much of the design to admire and take in, it took us a while to get round to the menu, but we certainly made the most of it when we did, sampling the hotel’s very own Mojito with a twist. \nHats off to head chef Gary Durrant who, along with award-winning food writer and broadcaster Henrietta Green, has created a menu to remember. \nInspired by ‘best of British’ recipes, ingredients and produce, there are plenty of delights to choose from. I went for pan-fried scallops with chilli jam and mango salsa to start with, while my friend chose baked prawns with tomato and garlic sauce. \nWe then went for a peppered loin of venison with beetroot purée, turnip and potato gratin, along with a roast rack of lamb with braised peas, baby carrots and mint. \nThe lamb was baked in a stone oven, which is on display for guests to see, and was cooked to perfection. \nVisitors this autumn can also choose from a range of creative game dishes.The Martini Library was the perfect lounge area to retire to after a scrumptious meal washed down with a delicious bottle of red. \nOnce again, the next morning we had to be forced out of our suite to get to breakfast, though, once again, it was so worth getting up for. \nIt is safe to say I’ll be making a return trip to The Arch. Though, to be honest, it took me enough effort to leave in the first place. \nTHE FACTS \n* The Arch London is at 50 Great Cumberland Place, Marble Arch, London, W1H 7FD. * Prices start from £205 for a deluxe room and from £499 for a suite. * For reservations call 02077 244700 or visit thearchlondon.com . * This autumn, Hunter 486 is celebrating game season, with chefs serving a different game dish every fortnight until December 13. \nFoodies can feast on top-quality game dishes such as roast loin of Royal Park venison and roasted goose breast.
