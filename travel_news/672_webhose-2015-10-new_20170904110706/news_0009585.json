Of the seven travelers in the group, I was the only person taking the vacation without a husband, friend, relative or partner. \nTraveling solo was a learning experience, because I quickly realized I had to make an effort to become part of the group. I couldn't stay inside my normal comfort zone as I do when traveling with my husband and friends.The suggestions that my friends who travel solo taught me a lot and following them made the trip more enjoyable. \nFirst, I learned that in group meals and during activities, it was easy to join the conversations. Next, I discovered that as I made friends, it was okay to ask if I could join them for dinner one night, or if they wanted to wander through a neighborhood with me during our free time Who Are Solo Travelers According to the U.S. Travel Association, solo travelers, those who travel alone with no companions, comprise 11% of all U.S. adult leisure travelers. These solo travelers appear to be a mix of ages and sexes, but they all have something in common: a desire to explore the world. Some are single adults who have never been married, others are divorced or widowed and prefer trips where all the arrangements are made for them, so they don't have to do any planning. Some are singles actively seeking mates, so they choose \"meet other singles\" trips aimed at this goal.\nOne friend loves to hike in such remote places as Tibet but her husband would rather play golf, so she joins trips planned by such groups as the Colorado Mountain Club. Yet another friend loves to simply take off for weeks at a time to visit exotic countries in Africa and explore on her own. She often includes time volunteering on local projects. She is a perfect example of how adventure travel is a high for solo travelers. Do You Have To Pay a Single Supplement? Most companies still require a single supplement, if you want to be sure to have a private room. (You can always ask for a discount on the supplement.) Some companies offer the option of not paying a single supplement, if you're willing to be paired with a stranger. If that's the approach you choose for economic or other reasons, ask the company how they decide who to pair with whom? Can you connect via email or phone with the person in advance? Make sure you're comfortable with the answer.\nIf you pay extra for a private room and it turns out you are the only solo traveler on the group, you'll wind up with a private room. If this happens, ask the company to consider giving you a refund. I did and the company returned the amount that I paid for a private room, since there was no one they could have placed with me.
