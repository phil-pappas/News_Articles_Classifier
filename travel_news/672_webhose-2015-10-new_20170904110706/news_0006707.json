Each bottle will cost $99.99 .\nIn order to participate in the lottery, those interested must be registered customers at www.FineWineAndGoodSpirits.com with billing information on file through Quick Checkout Profiles. Following registration, participants may opt in to this lottery between 8:00 AM Monday, Oct. 26 , and 11:00 PM Saturday , Oct. 31.\nBecause licensees constitute about one quarter of the PLCB's annual sales, 25 percent of the inventory will be available to licensees, while 75 percent will be available to individual consumers. In this case, six bottles are available to licensees and 18 are available to individual consumers.\nThe lottery is open to Pennsylvania residents and licensees age 21 or older who provide both a verifiable Pennsylvania billing address and a Pennsylvania shipping/store address at registration. Any registrant with an invalid or out-of-state address will be removed from the lottery.\nBecause the PLCB enforces a one-bottle-per-customer policy for its rarest products, only one customer at each billing address can register. Entries will be vetted for duplicative names, addresses and other information, and duplicates will be deleted from the lottery pool. Purchase is limited to one bottle per participant. Lottery drawings will be witnessed by an independent third party, and winners will be selected at random by a computer program.\nParticipants will be notified by email when the lottery process is complete.\nThe PLCB held its first Limited-Release Lottery in mid-October when it awarded 24 bottles of Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection, including 12 bottles of a 100 percent French oak barrel bourbon and 12 bottles of French oak barrel head aged bourbon. A total of 7,180 entries were received from licensees and individual consumers interested in opting into one or both products, and winners were randomly selected from pools of eligible entries ranging from 29 participants in a licensee drawing to nearly 3,300 participants in a drawing for individual consumers.\nFor more details regarding the Limited-Release Lottery, visit the Limited-Release Lottery web page at www.FineWineAndGoodSpirits.com , which can be found under the \"Events\" tab.\nFuture Limited-Release Lottery offerings will be announced through emails to customers registered at www.FineWineAndGoodSpirits.com and will be posted on the website.\nThe PLCB regulates the distribution of beverage alcohol and operates more than 600 wine and spirits stores statewide. Taxes and store profits are returned to Pennsylvania's General Fund. Since its inception, the PLCB has contributed nearly $14 billion to the Pennsylvania Treasury.
