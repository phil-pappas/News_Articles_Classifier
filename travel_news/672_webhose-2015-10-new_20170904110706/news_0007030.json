The attack happened about 50 to 100 yards from shore, the Honolulu Fire Department said.\nThe victim was injured in his lower legs, but the other man did not sustain any injuries, the Star-Advertiser reported.\nTwo nearby kayakers paddled the men back to shore, where Hawaii Fire Department staff and paramedics treated the victim. He was taken to the hospital in serious condition.\nAuthorities notified swimmers and cleared Kailua, Lanikai, and Mokulua beaches.\nAbout 7:20 p.m., a shark bit a 32-year-old man's left foot as he was in the water off Waikiki beach, the KITV station reported.\nThe man is in serious condition at a nearby trauma centre, the TV station reported.\nAnother man who surfs at the beach every day saw the rescue workers arrive.\n\"We were surfing out there. It was firing, and I hear all this commotion, but I had no idea it had to do with the shark. It's pretty crazy,\" Kyle Kaiser told the TV station. \"We see sharks out here, you know, but mostly small sharks. I never hear about a hoard of big, tiger sharks or anything like that. So yeah, very rare. I couldn't believe it.\"\nKaiser remembers last year's shark attacks happening in October, even referencing a 2003 incident when Bethany Hamilton, a professional surfer, lost her arm in a shark attack off Kauai. \"It seems like October is the month where this kind of thing happens,\" he said.\nThese are the sixth and seventh shark attacks in Hawaii this year and the second and third in as many weeks on Oahu. Earlier this month, a surfer lost most of his left leg after a shark attacked him off Oahu's north shore. One attack, which occurred in April on Maui, was fatal.\nAll shark attacks this year have happened in turbid or murky water.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:07:58.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
