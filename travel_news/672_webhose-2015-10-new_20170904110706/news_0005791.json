Thanks to the Napa Valley—Sonoma Valley Getaway vacation package offered by the hotels Meadowood Napa Valley and the Farmhouse Inn in Sonoma, wine connoisseurs can experience the region’s finest offerings with customized vineyard excursions and plenty of pampering. At Meadowood, guests are welcomed to their room or suite with a complimentary bottle of Napa Valley sparkling wine. Their two-night stay includes credit for daily breakfasts at the Grill (which showcases fresh produce picked from the hotel’s garden) and two 90-minute massages at the spa. In addition, the concierge staff will help guests create a Napa Valley wine-tasting itinerary based on their individual preferences.
