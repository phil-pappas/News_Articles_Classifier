Medellin born and Paris educated, he built Casa Medina in 1946, carefully assembling reclaimed floors, columns, paneling and ironwork to create an exclusive enclave of apartments in this fashionable area of the city. Recognised for its architectural heritage in 1984 and turned into a hotel in 1988, it soon became the chosen address for the city's power elite to meet, and a home-away-from-home for an international who's who from rock stars to industry leaders and heads of state.\nNow, with restoration by architect Milena Vargas and original architectural details enhanced with residential-style furnishings and a collection of traditional and contemporary artwork selected by designer Lauren Rottet – plus the addition of myriad conveniences for the modern traveller – Four Seasons Hotel Casa Medina Bogota takes its place among the finest luxury hotels in the world.\nIntroducing Castanyoles Raciones y Tapas\nFour Seasons also introduces a new destination amid the city's vibrant culinary scene: Castanyoles Raciones y Tapas , an open concept restaurant and tapas bar designed by Saul Sasson .\nStreet-side see-and-be-seen outdoor seating flows effortlessly into a tapas bar offering freshly brewed Colombian coffees and tapas, as well as bocatas and cocas (Catalan-style pizzas) to go.
