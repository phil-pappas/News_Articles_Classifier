But Gateshead Council’s fleet manager Graham Telfer says it is easier than you might think: “You just need to make everyone in the organisation understand the importance of driver safety,” he says. As Mr Telfer explains, a cornerstone of the council’s approach is rigorous driver assessments. Here, explains exactly what they entail. How big is Gateshead Council’s fleet? We have approximately 500 vehicles, including everything from cars and car-derived vans to 26-tonne refuse trucks. We also have a large “grey fleet” – i.e. employees who drive their own car on business, then claim back a mileage allowance. What do your driver assessments involve? Using in-house assessors, who have completed accredited training with the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM), we examine drivers of council-owned vehicles by reference to 14 criteria, such as observation, use of mirrors, use of speed and road positioning. Drivers are also tested on their knowledge of various council procedures, such as defect reporting, accidents and fuelling. As well as assessing drivers, we provide them with tips to encourage safe and fuel-efficient driving, and show them a road-safety DVD. We then provide detailed feedback about the assessment, and draw their line manager’s attention to any problem areas. These can be worked on with our fleet management team, through ongoing training. Drivers remain under constant scrutiny. If they are involved in an accident or traffic infringement, they are reassessed, and undergo further training as necessary. Is your grey fleet included in the assessment programme? No, but every supervisor is trained to ensure their staff remain safe on the road. Employees have to provide proof of MOT, insurance, tax and regular servicing before using their cars for business. As a further measure, we hold a pool of vehicles for staff to use when they need to drive on business, subject to availability. We ensure these vehicles are maintained to the highest standards. Before using one, employees are fully briefed on our driver policies. What other strategies do you adopt to enhance fleet safety? We carry out DVLA licence checks on everyone who drives on council business, whether in one of our fleet vehicles or their own car. We also perform eye tests on every driver. Communication is an important aspect of driver safety, and we regularly distribute information leaflets and display messages at the barriers of our car parks that inform employees of our expectations. Moreover, we provide policy documents in areas such as speeding, mobile phone use and driver fatigue/illness, in addition to driver handbooks. Every vehicle on our fleet has a speed limiter installed, so it cannot exceed 56mph. This has brought a twofold benefit: it mitigates the risk of a council driver being involved in an accident, and has yielded significant gains in fuel economy. How has Gateshead Council benefited from such careful attention to driver safety? Our accident rate has fallen by 40pc since 2008-9. That is a significant reduction, and shows the merit of our assessment programme. It is important to note that we report every incident, including mirror breakages and minor scrapes. That gives us a very clear picture of our safety record, but it also enshrines the seriousness with which the council views driver safety. There is no such thing as an inconsequential incident, as far as we are concerned. We always want to know if it could have been avoided. This attention to safety has improved employee morale. It shows that we care about our workforce, and take seriously our legal obligations to keep them safe at work. So no one resents our rigorous approach. They see it as a positive aspect of working for the council. A final benefit comes in relation to our costs. By minimising accidents, we reduce repair bills and down time. And because safer driving is usually more fuel efficient – thanks to gentler acceleration and braking – we are managing to cut our fuel bill across our whole fleet. In summary, what are the three most important aspects of driver safety in a business like yours? 1) Training: rigorous driver assessments are backed up by training for drivers and their managers. That ensures problems are dealt with, and employees feel supported rather than criticised. 2) Attention to detail: we look at every aspect of driver safety, and pay as much attention to minor incidents as we do to major accidents. It is all part of our holistic approach to fleet management. 3) Senior management buy-in: you will not achieve anything unless those at the top of your organisation understand the importance of driver safety. The senior managers at Gateshead Council have supported our initiatives at every turn. Your fleet in safe hands Whatever the size of your fleet, it pays to put driver safety at the top of your priority list. Not only does this ensure your people are kept out of harm’s way while they travel on business. It also brings cost savings and protects you from legal action if an accident does happen.
