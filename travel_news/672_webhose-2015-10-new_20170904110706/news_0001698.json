In addition to writing several books on the topic of productivity, his consultancy, Think Productive, has helped to transform the working cultures of businesses across the country and around the world. Today, as part of an ongoing series of collaborations between Canon and The Telegraph, Mr Allcott is visiting Nextbase UK — an in-car technology specialist based in Woking — to offer essential productivity tips for the firm during its current, rapid growth. Nextbase is the UK’s most popular brand of dashboard-mounted video cameras — better known as “dashcams”. By recording the view through the windscreen of a car, the dashcams provide drivers with a crucial and impartial witness in the event of a collision or other traffic mishap. “We’re still the only dashcam manufacturer to have an exclusive partnership with an insurer,” says Nextbase UK director Richard Browning. “We’re in discussion with a number of other insurers — not only about gaining new business, but also in terms of incentivising repeat business.” Even when it’s not possible to bring everyone together for a meeting, a simple email update can help to keep your team aligned The company has enjoyed 110pc growth in the financial year 2015-16, and is now looking to hire new staff to support the ongoing expansion. Mr Allcott recommends considering your productivity strategy when increasing the size of your workforce. “One of the things that can happen as you grow is that you grow inefficiency into the system,” he says. “If you make hires who aren’t quite at the same level as everyone else, it will take them time to get up to speed. “Meanwhile you are going to have less time to invest in people individually; you’ll be spread thinner and there’ll be more staff around.” In response to this challenge, Mr Allcott suggests focusing on alignment — taking steps to ensure that the whole workforce is up to speed on the company’s goals. Mr Browning agrees with this tactic, explaining that he recently introduced a bi-weekly strategy meeting to explain the plans made by himself and Rob Grant, the company’s managing director. “[Our staff ] know our strategy for the next two or three months, but I want to share what we’re doing for the year, or two years or three — because it’s so exciting,” Mr Browning says. “That’s only going to incentivise people, and let them know that although it’s very frantic, there is a long-term, robust strategy behind it.” Even when it’s not possible to bring everyone together for a meeting, a simple email update can help to keep your team aligned, says Mr Allcott. And clearly technology helps SMEs to stay productive in many other ways. Nextbase encourages remote working among its UK sale staff, while much of the business relies on communication with its partners in China. As such, technology already forms part of the company’s productivity strategy. Instant messaging can be very efficient, but it can also be the biggest cause of interruptions in an office “We use Skype, Dropbox, Google Docs and FTP sites,” says Mr Grant. “Technology use adds efficiency to the business, but we are not driven by it.” Mr Allcott suggests that Nextbase could benefit from the use of a tool like Trello — an online project management application for use on mobile devices. “Firstly, it’s a really good way for people to write their to-do lists online,” says Mr Allcott. “You can also bring people together to work on projects. They can assign each other tasks, tick off their progress and so on. “It’s particularly useful if you have staff working from home, as it replicates some of that water cooler chat, allowing instant task-based feedback.” For an SME, technology can play a key role in enabling communication between employees and partners — but it’s essential to establish clear guidelines for the use of these tools. “Instant messaging can be very efficient, but it can also be the biggest cause of interruptions in an office,” says Mr Allcott. “I would implore you to think about the etiquette rules around IM. Is it at certain times of the day that your workers use it? Do you give people a grace period so that they don’t have to respond to messages instantly, but perhaps within an hour? “The rules you set will determine how much or how little people are interrupted in their work.” • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:29:35.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
