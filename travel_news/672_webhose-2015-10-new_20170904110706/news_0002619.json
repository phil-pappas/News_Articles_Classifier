Momentum , a collective set up with the backing of the Labour leader and the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, aims to influence party policy but MPs are worried it is the beginning of a purge of moderate members who don't support the leader. One Shadow Cabinet Minister said: \"They are setting up a party within a party and I fear that they will use it to take control of conference, policy-making and mount a purge.\" \"The array of vested interests confronting us cannot be taken on by one man or even a single political party in Westminster. Instead, we need a bigger, broader, deeper alliance that can confront such powerful, vested interests\" Clive Lewis, one of Mr Corbyn's closest allies Another MP asked not to be named but described the new group as \"a worrying sign\" while respected Labour MP Stephen Pound told The Telegraph: \"This is basically a parallel organisation as far as I'm concerned, it's against the principles of the Labour party and I think less of Jeremy Corbyn for endorsing it. \"It will inevitably be seen as a threat to sitting MPs and the Labour party in parliament - it is a retrograde step.\" Welcoming the group, which is also backed by a group of Labour MPs including Katy Clark, Clive Lewis, Richard Burgon, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Kate Osamor, Mr Corbyn said: \"Now, more than ever, we need to unite and continue to build our movement to change our politics and to win together in 2020. A look at the group's website Photo: Momentum \"We need us to put our values, the people’s values, back into politics. To do this, we need to keep up the momentum we have built over the last four months.” According to its website Momentum is independent of the Labour party and aims to influence party policy and organise a \"mass movement\" in homes and workplaces. It is understood to have the backing of union members as well as the party and organisers have vowed to set up democratic leadership structures as it develops. In an article for New Statesman Clive Lewis, one of Mr Corbyn's closest allies in parliament and a director of the new Quote: : \"Whilst out Party can play a key leadership role in future political change it must also understand it does not have a monopoly on opposing vested interest.\" He added: \"Be under no illusion - the powerful, the exploiters, the excessively wealthy will not pull their punches. \"By standing up to them, both Jeremy and the Labour Party will face an unparalleled assault that will make what happened to Ed Miliband pale into insignificance. \"The array of vested interests confronting us cannot be taken on by one man or even a single political party in Westminster. Instead, we need a bigger, broader, deeper alliance that can confront such powerful, vested interests.\" Mr Lewis has previously spoken of the need for campaigners to \"put pressure\" on moderate MPs to prevent Mr Corbyn from being \"murdered\" by critics. At the party's Brighton conference last week he said: \"The only thing that will save and protect Jeremy is if the political space we make out there and the pressure we put on those MPs who don’t have the definitive politics that we might have.” Luke Akehurst, secretary of moderate campaign group Labour First said the creation of Momentum looks \"divisive\". He added: \"We are concerned that the warm words on Momentum's website ...are actually code for using the vast amounts of data and contact details obtained during the campaign to mobilise factionally within Labour, both to win internal elections and selections and to deselect moderate MPs and councillors who are not judged \"politically correct\" by the veteran Bennite organisers ... behind \"Momentum\". telepolitics Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:38:34.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
