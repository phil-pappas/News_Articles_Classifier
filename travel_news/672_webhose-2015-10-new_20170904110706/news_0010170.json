The fabulous building - which overlooks both the resort's championship golf courses and the spectacular North Sea coast - reopened on September 10, with a drinks and canap√© reception for around 120 invited guests. And they were then able to enjoy the new St Andrews Bar & Grill, which will be specialising in locally produced steaks and freshly caught seafood. \nThe redesigned clubhouse featured four bars for the evening: the Steak Bar; Crab Bar (the Fisherman's Larder); and the Seafood Bar, which offered St Andrews Bay lobster, langoustines and oysters - plus the Gin Cocktail Bar, which was sponsored by the nearby Eden Mill St Andrews, Distillery and Brewery. General manager John Keating was on hand to welcome guests and gave a well-received re-opening speech, which also touched upon future plans for both the new bar and grill and the five-star hotel. He also praised the work of chefs Jamie Hill and Alan Matthew, whose team had produced the stunning food for the evening. He said: \"We believe the new St Andrews Bar & Grill will become the destination of choice for those in the area wishing to experience the best in local steak and seafood. We have put a lot of time and effort into creating the new clubhouse and recruiting the right staff to ensure that the dining experience here is unrivalled.\" Upon departure, guests were presented with a St Andrews Bar & Grill jute gift bag, which featured a bottle of Eden Kilted Kittock amber ale and a voucher for a complementary meal for two. As well as two exceptional championship golf courses and a world-class spa, Fairmont St Andrews includes award-winning dining, luxurious guest accommodation and exceptional service, as well as unfettered access to the charms of the old town of St Andrews itself, the unique Home of Golf.
