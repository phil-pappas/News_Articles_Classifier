But there are some particular ways to ensure that you are ready to seize upon potential boons when they do occur. Here are five ways to prep for success. 1. Spread the word In the early days of any business, it’s essential to put in the hard graft to raise awareness of your venture, even if that means pounding the streets yourself. “Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty in the process,” says CVLibrary founder Lee Biggins. “I’d personally distribute flyers to make sure people found out about us.” 2. Identify and pursue networking opportunities Many business deals stem from making contacts, both online and in the real world. Consider every meeting to be free, personal promotion. “We like to interact with customers, online and face-to-face at trade shows,” says Neil Westwood, founder of Magic Whiteboard, which featured on Dragons’ Den on 2008. “We use online chat software Zopim and also actively promote in French, German and Spanish. Going on Dragons’ Den was also a great way to promote Magic Whiteboard and it was free.” 3. Make the most of social media Social media offers huge opportunities to promote your business to people who have already registered their interest in a particular area. “Following people in your industry on Twitter can keep you looped in on what’s going on, which is a must for seizing business opportunities as they come along,” says Sallie Boyce, founder of Communica PR. “From the point of view of getting press coverage, it means that you can be the first to comment on a breaking story. If you see a story that you or your company has an opinion on, you can tweet the most relevant journalist and strike up a conversation.” 4. Enter industry awards These can be a great way of raising a business’s profile, especially if you end up with a gong. “Should you win, you’ll get great exposure at the awards event itself and you’ll almost always get interviewed for an upcoming blog or magazine article that will continue to raise awareness of your business long after the event,” says Ben Thompson, managing director of EstateAgent4Me. “Even just making a shortlist can be valuable promotion.” 5. Use a mentor Having a mentor can not only give you a much-needed injection of experience and the right tactics to chase down leads, it can also provide vital contacts and introductions, says Rafael Dos Santos, founder of social enterprise This Foreigner Can. “Not only will your mentor guide you on businesses issues, they will also open doors and introduce you to suppliers, investors and other people in the sector,” he says. “Most importantly, mentors are normally successful businesspeople so they won’t see you as competition.” Celebrating Connections Visit the Telegraph's Celebrating Connections hub to read practical advice on how to connect your business with the like-minded organisations and support networks that help you grow.
