However, there is plenty of misinformation out there about our fair nation, so we thought it was time to set the record straight by outlining a few facts about Australia that aren’t quite true. John White/Getty Images 1. Koalas are bears \nWhen Europeans first happened across the fascinating creature that is the koala, it was given the scientific name phascolarctos cinereus , which basically means “ash-coloured pouched bear”. This soon gave way to the nickname Koala Bear. While it’s a cute name, the truth of the matter is that koalas aren’t even distantly related to bears; they’re marsupials. Hero Images/Getty Images 2. Australians drink Fosters beer \nDespite the very successful advertising campaign “Fosters: Australian for Beer”, Australians very rarely drink Fosters. In fact, it’s so unpopular you’d be unlikely to find it on the shelves of just any old liquor store. Aussies prefer the taste of Victoria Bitter, Toohey’s New and Carlton Draught.

Kangaroos are highly intelligent (and everywhere) \nThanks to Skippy , arguably the world’s most famous kangaroo, there is a misconception that kangaroos are not only very smart, but also incredibly dexterous. Contrary to the 1960s television series, kangaroos can’t actually open safes or doors and they’re unlikely to guide you to safety if you’re lost in the bush. They’re much more likely just to hop away. Also when visiting Australia, don’t expect to see kangaroos hopping down the streets of Sydney or Melbourne. While kangaroos are relatively common further inland, you’re much more likely to see them in zoos than in the city. Suebg/Getty Images 4. Everything in Australia will kill you \nWhile it is true that Australia its fair share of venomous snakes , not to mention a whole list of unsavoury creepy-crawlers , not everything in Australia is trying to kill you. In fact, most of the unique Australian flora and fauna is perfectly friendly, if not a little timid. David Trood/Getty Images 5. Australians all live in the outback \nThanks to movies like Australia , there is a common belief that the vast majority of Aussies live in the outback, sweating it out on sheep or cattle farms. In actual fact, 85% of Aussies live within 50 kilometres of the coast . Brian Leatart/Getty Images 6. Aussies love barbequed “shrimp” \nFollowing the very popular tourism campaign in 1984, which featured Crocodile Dundee’s Paul Hogan, Aussie phrases like “fair dinkum”, “G’day” and “slip another shrimp on the barbie” were considered popular Australian vernacular. While Aussies do say ‘G’day’ (albeit, not as often as you’d think) and definitely love a good BBQ (which is known as a barbie), shrimps are very rarely mentioning. That’s because in Australia, shrimps are tiny prawns usually found in Chinese fried rice dishes. What Americans call shrimp, we Australians know as ‘prawns’. John W Banagan/Getty Images 7. Qantas has never crashed \nA very famous scene in the 1988 movie Rainman perpetrated the myth that Australian airline Qantas has never crashed. It might be great publicity, but it’s not completely true: Qantas has had a number of fatal accidents , the last of which occurred in 1951. Tomas del Amo/Getty Images 8. All Australians are fit and have great tans \nMany Aussies wish this one were true, but sadly Australia is ranked as one of the most obese countries in the world , with almost a quarter of the population considered obese. In addition, Australia has the highest rate of skin cancer of any country in the world. Skin cancer, which is caused by over-exposure to the sun’s UV rays, killed more than 2000 Aussies in 2011. The Australian government has even created an anti-tanning campaign , encouraging Aussies to be more sun smart. Adam BHB/Getty Images 9. All Aussies surf \nWhile it’s true that coastal regions of Australia do have a surfing culture, the reality is that only a small percentage of the population can actually catch a wave! You’re much more likely to see Aussies bobbing in the shallow waves or relaxing on the sand than up on a board. Peter Cade/Getty Images 10. Toilets flush backwards \nThe Simpsons is probably to blame for this particular myth; in an episode the characters marvel that the toilets flush in the opposite direction because they are in the Southern Hemisphere. This isn’t actually true – in fact, due to the lower water levels, Aussie toilets flush down instead of around .
