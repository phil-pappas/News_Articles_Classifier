Show your muscles by drinking it with one hand, but no one is going to fault you for going to two after a few. While there are halbes Liter (half liters) available at most beer halls , at Oktoberfest it is full Maß ahead. Beer Alternatives at Oktoberfest \nIf that seems like altogether too much beer, order a Radler (half beer and half lemonade). You can also find many non-alcoholic alternatives in Munich . \nIf you don't want beer at all, there is Weinzelt , the wine tent. Luckily, drinks don't come in a Maß there. There is Apfelwein , Sekt (champagne or German sparkling white wine to be precise), Rotwein (red wine) and Weisswein (white wine) like Germany's famous Rieslings . You can also buy small bottles in tents like Hofbräu and Schützen. Want more booze? First - bad idea . But you can get Schnapps (shots) at many stands around the Wiesn . Try Kirsch (cherry), Apfel (apple) and Pfefferminz (peppermint). Non-Drinkers Guide to Oktoberfest \nIf you are a non-drinker, there are a few options. Alkoholfreies Bier (non-alcoholic beer) has no alcohol, but is cruelly the same price as regular beer. Apfelschorle (sparkling apple juice), Sprite and Cola are also available in halbes Liter for half the price. Wasser (water) comes in a variety of carbonation levels at prices close to that of the beer - ouch. How do I order a beer? \nThe Kellner(in) are beer-wielding pros. They bustle through the tents with a dozen Mass es on their arm. They can be a tad intimidating. Be brave and order in the universal language of sign by getting their attention (no snapping, just eye contact and a wave) and then a finer, or two or three or however many beers you want. If you want to try out your German, order \" Ein Mass, bitte! \" (A beer, please!). \nHave some patience as the Kellner(in ) navigate the crowds and the drunks and deliver your order to your seat. Payment is expected upon delivery, in cash, with tip . No tip means no service, which would make for a very bad time in the beer tent. Tip two or three euro on your first beer, then you can offer 10 percent on the following beers. When to drink at Oktoberfest \nThis heading makes it sound more complicated than it is. You will drink a lot at Oktoberfest. There are many rituals and opportunities. And times where it is even mandatory. \nFor example, whenever someone raises a glass with a \" Prost ! \" they will start clinking glasses with everyone in their party, and after a few beers, anyone within reach. Respond with a \" Prost \" or \" zum wohl \" (to your health\") and clink glasses while looking them in the eye. Breaking eye contact means seven years bad sex - a curse the Germans take seriously. \nAnother mandatory drink is when the familiar sound of \" Ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit \" come from the band. Watch people pick up their beers and sing before it ends with \" 1, 2, 3 gsuffa ' (one, two three drink) and the whole beer hall follows the command.
