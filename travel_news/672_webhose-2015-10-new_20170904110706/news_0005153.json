After all, the unfortunate truth is that many people who walk out of prison will be walking back in.\nPOINT OF VIEW: Not every ex-felon should regain right to vote We don’t let everyone vote. That’s because we have certain objective, minimum requirements of responsibility, trustworthiness and commitment to our laws that we require of people — before entrusting them with a role in the solemn enterprise of self-government. So we deny the right to vote to children, noncitizens, the mentally incompetent — and people who have committed serious crimes against their fellow citizens.\nOnce a person has shown he has turned over a new leaf by going some period of time without committing a new crime, he could be re-enfranchised at a congratulatory ceremony, rather like a naturalization ceremony for new citizens. But it has to be earned if it is to mean anything.\nROGER CLEGG, FALLS CHURCH, VA.\nEditor’s note: Roger Clegg is president and general counsel for the Center for Equal Opportunity.\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/09/de/4a/Clegg-pov-to-use.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:21:55.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
