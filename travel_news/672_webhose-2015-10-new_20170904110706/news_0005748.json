Currently, in order for parents and caregivers to find help with childrearing issues and concerns, they have to visit numerous websites. But how can they tell if this information can be trusted? We live in a world where everyone can be a content creator, and while it's crucial that we all have a voice, sometimes it's hard to decipher what is proven fact and what is not. Some questions are too private to ask family and friends or to post publicly on personal social accounts. Seeing and experiencing this challenge firsthand, co-founders Matt Connell and John Christensen saw the need for a \"one-stop-shop\" that not only has interesting content, but a variety of helpful parenting tools. Yellowbrick.me was born with the goal of being a judgment-free website where parents and caregivers can find the support and resources they truly need locally and globally. No matter who you are or where you come from, advice can be gathered from other parents and caregivers who have experienced what you're going through. At the same time, you can help others through the tough times that come with raising a child. When one is attempting to be the best parent or caregiver, it can be critical to stay on top of new studies in child development. But more often than not, these professional articles are long, wordy and hard to understand if you're not a researcher yourself. Yellowbrick.me simplifies these findings into short, easy to read pieces. This allows parents and caregivers to effortlessly stay in the loop. In order to support global and local communities, Yellowbrick.me has developed a special form of currency on their site called \"bricks.\" Yellowbrick.me members have the ability to help back research projects and non-profit organizations or can pay it forward to other members by donating purchased \"bricks\" to a variety of initiatives. These \"bricks\" can also be redeemed for rewards and prizes. Yellowbrick.me is currently working with charities like Circle of Health International, After-School All-Stars, Jevaia International, Vermont Food Bank, and more. Members will also be able to decide which charities and causes Yellowbrick.me will donate a percentage of annual proceeds. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:01:41.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
