Including special items, UAL reported third-quarter net income of $4.8 billion . These results include a nonrecurring $3.2 billion non-cash gain associated with the reversal of the company's income tax valuation allowance. \"I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, professionalism and contributions to another successful quarter. The United family has had a challenging few weeks, but we have never felt more unified and are committed to making the right investments in our people and providing them the tools they need to deliver excellent service to our customers,\" said Brett Hart , acting CEO of United. \"With Oscar Munoz on medical leave, this leadership team and I are working to push forward the agenda we laid out over the past six weeks by focusing on our employees, improving our processes and investing in our systems to further improve our margins.\"\nThird-Quarter Revenue and Capacity\nFor the third quarter of 2015, total revenue was $10.3 billion , a decrease of 2.4 percent year-over-year. In the quarter, the company amended its co-branded credit card marketing services agreement, which led to approximately $100 million of incremental revenue. This was more than offset by the declines in passenger revenue.\nThird-quarter 2015 consolidated PRASM decreased 5.8 percent and consolidated yield decreased 5.6 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014. The declines in PRASM and yield were driven largely by a strong U.S. dollar, lower surcharges, travel reductions from corporate customers in the energy sector and softening in domestic yields. \"Fourth-quarter pre-tax margin is expected to be between 9.5 and 11.5 percent, excluding special items,\" Hart added.\nPassenger revenue for the third quarter of 2015 and period-to-period comparisons of related statistics for UAL's mainline and regional operations are included in the tables in the back of this document.\nThird-Quarter Costs\nTotal operating expense excluding special items was $8.3 billion in the third quarter, down 10.7 percent year-over-year. Including special charges, total operating expense was $8.4 billion , a 10.3 percent decrease year-over-year. The decrease was driven by lower oil prices and good non-fuel cost performance as a result of a strong U.S. dollar, improved operational performance and the company's Project Quality efficiency and quality initiative. Consolidated unit cost (CASM), excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing decreased 1.5 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014. Consolidated CASM including those items decreased 12.1 percent year-over-year.\nLiquidity and Capital Allocation\nIn the third quarter, UAL generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, $627 million in free cash flow, and ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in unrestricted liquidity, including $1.35 billion of undrawn commitments under its revolving credit facility. During the third quarter, the company continued to invest in its business through gross capital expenditures of approximately $716 million , excluding fully reimbursable projects. These investments include new aircraft purchases, aircraft refurbishments and investments in the company's hubs at New York / Newark , San Francisco , Houston and Chicago .\nThe company spent $230 million to complete its initial $1 billion share buyback program in the quarter and spent an additional $32 million toward its new $3 billion authorization, bringing the total returned to shareholders in the quarter to $262 million .\nUAL earned a 19.8 percent return on invested capital for the 12 months ended September 30 , 2015.\nFor more information on UAL's fourth-quarter 2015 guidance, please visit ir.united.com for the company's investor update.\nAbout United\nUnited Airlines and United Express operate an average of nearly 5,000 flights a day to 352 airports across six continents.

In 2014, more than 2,500 flight attendants elected to voluntarily separate from the company and will receive a severance payment, with a maximum value of $100,000 per participant, based on years of service, with retirement dates through the end of 2016.\nIntegration-related costs: Integration-related costs include compensation costs related primarily to systems integration and training for employees.\n(Gains) losses on sale of assets and other special charges: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the company recorded $33 million and $45 million, respectively, for losses on the sale of one aircraft, the impairment of several engines held for sale and discontinued internal software projects.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt: During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the company recorded $134 million of losses as part of Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net due to the write-off of the unamortized non-cash debt discount related to the extinguishment of the 6% Notes due 2026 and 6% Notes due 2028.\nVenezuela currency loss : During the third quarter of 2015, the company recorded a $61 million foreign exchange loss related to its cash holdings in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has maintained currency controls and fixed official exchange rates (i.e. Sistema Complementario de Administracion de Divisas, or SICAD, and Sistema Marginal de Divisas, or SIMADI) for many years. Previously, airlines were permitted to use the more favorable SICAD rate (currently 13.5 Venezuelan bolivars to one U.S. dollar) if repatriating profits and for payments of local goods and services in Venezuela. During 2015, many of the payments for local goods and services have transitioned to utilizing the SIMADI rate (currently 200 Venezuelan bolivars to one U.S. dollar) or have been required to be paid in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, the Venezuelan government has not permitted the exchange and repatriations of local currency since mid-2014. As a result, the Company has decided to change the exchange rate from historical SICAD rates to a combination of SIMADI and SICAD rates based on projections of future cash payments. Including this adjustment, the company's resulting cash balance held in Venezuelan bolivars at September 30, 2015 is approximately $15 million.\nMTM losses from fuel derivative contracts settling in future periods and prior period gains (losses) on fuel derivative contracts settled in the current period: The company uses certain combinations of derivative contracts that are economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, the company may enter into contracts at different times and later combine those contracts into structures designated for hedge accounting. As with derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, the economic hedges and individual contracts are part of the company's program to mitigate the adverse financial impact of potential increases in the price of fuel. The company records changes in the fair value of these various contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting to Nonoperating income (expense):\nMiscellaneous, net in the statements of consolidated operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the company recorded $36 million and $28 million, respectively, in MTM losses on fuel derivative contracts that will settle in future periods. For fuel derivative contracts that settled in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the company recorded MTM losses of $69 million and $173 million, respectively, in prior periods. The figures above also include an insignificant amount of ineffectiveness on hedges that are designated for hedge accounting.\n2014 - Special items\nSeverance and benefits: During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the company recorded $58 million of severance and benefits primarily related to reductions of management and front-line employees, including from Hopkins International Airport (Cleveland), as part of its cost savings initiatives. The company reduced its average daily departures from Cleveland by over 60 percent during the second quarter of 2014. The company is currently evaluating its options regarding its long-term contractual commitments at Cleveland. The capacity reductions at Cleveland may result in further special charges, which could be significant, related to our contractual commitments.\nIntegration-related costs: Integration-related costs included compensation costs related to systems integration, training, severance and relocation for employees.\nCosts associated with permanently grounding Embraer ERJ 135 aircraft: During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the company recorded $66 million for the permanent grounding of 21 of the company's Embraer ERJ 135 regional aircraft under lease through 2018, which included an accrual for remaining lease payments and an amount for maintenance return conditions. The company decided to permanently ground these 21 Embraer ERJ 135 aircraft as a result of new Embraer E175 regional jet deliveries, the impact of pilot shortages at regional carriers and fuel prices.\n(Gains)/losses on sale of assets and other special charges: During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the company recorded $33 million for charges related primarily to the impairment of its flight equipment held for disposal associated with its Boeing 737-300 and 737-500 fleets and incurred losses on sales of aircraft and other assets and other special losses totaling $28 million.\nVenezuela currency loss: During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the company recorded $21 million of losses due to exchange rate changes in Venezuela applicable to funds held in local currency.\nMTM losses from fuel derivative contracts settling in future periods and prior period gains on fuel derivative contracts settled in the current period: The company utilizes certain derivative instruments that are economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The company records changes in the fair value of these economic hedges to Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net in the statements of consolidated operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, the company recorded $95 million and $57 million, respectively, in MTM losses on economic hedges that will settle in future periods. For economic hedges that settled in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014, the company recorded MTM gains of $16 million and $63 million, respectively, in prior periods. The figures above also include an insignificant amount of ineffectiveness on hedges that are designated for hedge accounting.\n(C)\nThe company's income tax benefit was $3.2 billion for both the third quarter of 2015 and nine months ended September 30, 2015. This compares to an income tax benefit of $4 million in the third quarter of 2014 and a $1 million tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. A discrete tax benefit of $3.1 billion for the reduction to the U.S. net federal deferred tax asset valuation allowance and an approximately $100 million tax benefit related to a reduction to the net state deferred tax asset valuation allowance was included in the income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2015 and nine months ended September 30, 2015.\nUNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS,

CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION\nUAL evaluates its financial performance utilizing various accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and Non-GAAP financial measures, including income (loss) before income taxes excluding special items, net income (loss) excluding special items, net earnings (loss) per share excluding special items, and CASM, among others. CASM is a common metric used in the airline industry to measure an airline's cost structure and efficiency. Pursuant to SEC Regulation G, UAL has included the following reconciliation of reported Non-GAAP financial measures to comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. UAL believes that adjusting for special items is useful to investors because special charges are non-recurring charges not indicative of UAL's ongoing performance. In addition, the company believes that adjusting for MTM gains and losses from fuel derivative contracts settling in future periods and prior period gains and losses on fuel derivative contracts settled in the current period is useful because the adjustments allow investors to better understand the cash impact of settled fuel derivative contracts in a given period. UAL also believes that excluding third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and catering services for third parties, fuel sales and non-air mileage redemptions, provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to UAL's core business. UAL also believes that excluding fuel costs from certain measures is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of management's performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence. UAL excludes profit sharing because this exclusion allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry. UAL also believes that adjusting capital expenditures for fully reimbursable projects is useful to investors in order to appropriately reflect the non-reimbursable funds spent on capital expenditures.\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30,\n$\n%\nSeptember 30,\n$\n%\n2015\n2014\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\n2015\n2014\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nOperating expenses\n$8,407\n$9,372\n$(965)\n(10.3)\n$24,743\n$27,840\n$(3,097)\n(11.1)\nLess: Special charges (B)\n76\n43\n33\nNM\n195\n264\n(69)\nNM\nOperating expenses, excluding special charges\n8,331\n9,329\n(998)\n(10.7)\n24,548\n27,576\n(3,028)\n(11.0)\nLess: Third-party business expenses\n70\n61\n9\n14.8\n205\n469\n(264)\n(56.3)\nLess: Fuel expense\n1,934\n3,127\n(1,193)\n(38.2)\n5,904\n9,145\n(3,241)\n(35.4)\nLess: Profit sharing, including taxes\n277\n129\n148\n114.7\n545\n182\n363\n199.5\nOperating expenses, excluding fuel, profit sharing, special charges and third-party business expenses\n$6,050\n$6,012\n$38\n0.6\n$17,894\n$17,780\n$114\n0.6\nIncome before income taxes\n$1,606\n$920\n$686\n74.6\n$3,314\n$1,105\n$2,209\n199.9\nLess: Special items before income tax benefit\n104\n154\n(50)\nNM\n245\n405\n(160)\nNM\nIncome before income taxes and excluding special items\n$1,710\n$1,074\n$636\n59.2\n$3,559\n$1,510\n$2,049\n135.7\nNet income\n$4,816\n$924\n$3,892\n421.2\n$6,517\n$1,104\n$5,413\n490.3\nLess: Special items, net of tax (B)\n(3,114)\n151\n(3,265)\nNM\n(2,973)\n401\n(3,374)\nNM\nNet income, excluding special items\n$1,702\n$1,075\n$627\n58.3\n$3,544\n$1,505\n$2,039\n135.5\nDiluted earnings per share\n$12.82\n$2.37\n$10.45\n440.9\n$17.15\n$2.84\n$14.31\nNM\nAdd back: Special items, net of tax\n(8.29)\n0.38\n(8.67)\nNM\n(7.83)\n1.02\n(8.85)\nNM\nDiluted earnings per share, excluding special items\n$4.53\n$2.75\n$1.78\n64.7\n$9.32\n$3.86\n$5.46\n141.5\nUNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL RECONCILIATION (Continued)\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n%\nSeptember 30,\n%\n2015\n2014\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\n2015\n2014\nIncrease/ (Decrease)\nCASM Mainline Operations (cents)\nCost per available seat mile (CASM)\n11.97\n13.51\n(11.4)\n12.43\n14.14\n(12.1)\nLess: Special charges (B)\n0.13\n0.07\nNM\n0.12\n0.17\nNM\nCASM, excluding special charges\n11.84\n13.44\n(11.9)\n12.31\n13.97\n(11.9)\nLess: Third-party business expenses\n0.12\n0.11\n9.1\n0.12\n0.29\n(58.6)\nCASM, excluding special charges and third-party business expenses\n11.72\n13.33\n(12.1)\n12.19\n13.68\n(10.9)\nLess: Fuel expense\n2.77\n4.45\n(37.8)\n2.98\n4.59\n(35.1)\nCASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses and fuel\n8.95\n8.88\n0.8\n9.21\n9.09\n1.3\nLess: Profit sharing per available seat mile\n0.47\n0.23\n104.3\n0.33\n0.11\n200.0\nCASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel, and profit sharing\n8.48\n8.65\n(2.0)\n8.88\n8.98\n(1.1)\nCASM Consolidated Operations (cents)\nCost per available seat mile (CASM)\n12.60\n14.34\n(12.1)\n13.11\n14.98\n(12.5)\nLess: Special charges (B)\n0.12\n0.07\nNM\n0.10\n0.14\nNM\nCASM, excluding special charges\n12.48\n14.27\n(12.5)\n13.01\n14.84\n(12.3)\nLess: Third-party business expenses\n0.10\n0.09\n11.1\n0.11\n0.25\n(56.0)\nCASM, excluding special charges and third-party business expenses\n12.38\n14.18\n(12.7)\n12.90\n14.59\n(11.6)\nLess: Fuel expense\n2.90\n4.79\n(39.5)\n3.13\n4.92\n(36.4)\nCASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses and fuel\n9.48\n9.39\n1.0\n9.77\n9.67\n1.0\nLess: Profit sharing per available seat mile\n0.42\n0.19\n121.1\n0.29\n0.10\n190.0\nCASM, excluding special charges, third-party business expenses, fuel, and profit sharing\n9.06\n9.20\n(1.5)\n9.48\n9.57\n(0.9)\nUNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FREE CASH FLOW\nCapital Expenditures\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2015\nCapital expenditures -
