Honouring the individuals whose lives have been altered by breast cancer, Star Cruises, a wholly owned subsidiary of Genting Hong Kong, together with the crew members of SuperStar Gemini, are turning pink in October in support of the campaign and to help spread the word about this devastating disease.\nAs part of the company’s ongoing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program, Star Cruises is honoured to be given the opportunity to be part of this year’s Wear The Pink Ribbon Campaign in Singapore. During the entire month of October, Star Cruises will have donation boxes by Breast Cancer Foundation onboard its locally homeported cruise ship, SuperStar Gemini, as well as at their Singapore Star Cruises office (11-08, Park Mall) to help raise funds for the campaign.\nAdditionally, exclusively designed Breast Cancer Foundation pink ribbon pins will be available to supporters who give a minimum donation of SGD$2 for the standard pin and SGD$5 for the special crystal design.\nAll Star Cruises staff in Singapore and crew members onboard SuperStar Gemini will also be donning the pink ribbon pins in support of the campaign during Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October.\n“On behalf of Star Cruises, we are proud to be collaborating with Breast Cancer Foundation this year to support their important mission through the Wear The Pink Ribbon Campaign. By teaming up, our goal is to help increase the level of awareness on the fight against breast cancer and raise funds to support the ongoing efforts of the foundation in Singapore,” said Mr. Michael Goh, Senior Vice President – Sales, Star Cruises.\nStar Cruises is also sponsoring 3 Night cruises (Sunday) to Penang/Kuala Lumpur or Penang/Langkawi onboard SuperStar Gemini as lucky draw prizes for Breast Cancer Foundation’s ‘Pin It To Win It’ contest, adding excitement and fun to the Wear The Pink Ribbon Campaign. Members of the public who are spotted by Breast Cancer Foundation staff or volunteers wearing their pink ribbon pins in October will stand a chance to win a variety of attractive prizes, including the Star Cruises cruise packages.\n“We are delighted to collaborate with Star Cruises in our Wear The Pink Ribbon Campaign. The fight against breast cancer is a difficult journey indeed, and we are thankful for the generosity of sponsors such as Star Cruises, who come alongside us to render their support,” said Mrs Noor Quek, President of Breast Cancer Foundation. “Thank you, Star Cruises, for adding more wind in our sails!”\n“We invite everyone, especially those cruising with us onboard SuperStar Gemini to give generously and wear their pink ribbon in October to show support for this incredibly meaningful cause,” added Mr. Michael Goh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:40:46.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
