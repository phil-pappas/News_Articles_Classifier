Picture: Andrew Gregory/Destination NSW.\nThe Jenolan Caves\nThey’re Australia’s most impressive limestone caves and one of the largest cave systems in the world. Situated in the Blue Mountains, 11 show caves are open to the public to explore the dark chambers, underground rivers and awe-inspiring cave formations.\nThe local Gundungurra people know Jenolan as ‘Binoomea’ which means ‘the dark place’ and a number of ghostly tales have emerged over the years mostly connected to James Wiburd, Jenolan’s third caretaker from 1903.\nIt is believed that Wiburd loved the place so much that he chose never to leave, lingering to keep an eye on things. Visitors can take lantern-lit ghost tours of the complex cave system and can stay overnight at Caves House.\nThey say the ghost of James Wiburd haunts the caves. Picture: David Hill/Destination NSW.\nMonte Cristo Homestead\nLocated in the town of Junee in southwest New South Wales, the Monte Cristo Homestead holds the reputation as Australia’s most haunted house.\nThis beautifully renovated and decorated colonial mansion bears a dark history of murder, torture and insanity.

Operating for 150 years, the jail was closed in 1998 and has since become one of the State’s premier heritage listed sites.\nVisitors to Maitland Gaol are offered the opportunity to venture inside the facility which remains genuine to the day the gates were shut. Guests can choose to take a self-guided audio tour or a themed guided tour by day or night.\nFor groups who want to experience the jail at night, a group sleepover in the cells can be arranged but be warned, this tour is not for the faint of heart.\nStay the night in one of the jail cells this Halloween.
