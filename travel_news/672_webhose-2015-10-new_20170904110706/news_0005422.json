The airline now offers Chicago-based Crafthouse Cocktails’ Moscow Mule on United-operated North and Central America flights, and Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey on flights worldwide. \nCrafthouse Moscow Mule \nProduced with all-natural ingredients, Crafthouse Cocktails’ Moscow Mule contains small-batch vodka; ginger beer made with organic ginger juice; pure California lime juice; and real cane sugar. Crafthouse’s take on the Moscow Mule – a classic vodka cocktail – is also gluten-free. \nBuffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey \nMade from the finest corn, rye and barley malt at the most award-winning distillery in the world, Buffalo Trace’s bourbon whiskey ages in new-oak barrels for years in century-old warehouses until the peak of maturity – giving this spirit a rich and complex taste, with hints of vanilla, toffee and candied fruit. \n“We are pleased to partner with Crafthouse Cocktails and Buffalo Trace to offer our customers these popular drinks,” said Tom O’Toole, United’s senior vice president and chief marketing officer. “These new selections further enhance and expand our choices for the tastes of today’s passengers.” \nOn board, passengers may purchase a 200-milliliter bottle – enough for two servings – of Crafthouse’s Moscow Mule for $12.99. A 50-milliliter miniature bottle of Buffalo Trace will be complimentary in premium cabins and $8.99 in United Economy. \nIn addition, Crafthouse’s Moscow Mule and Buffalo Trace bourbon whiskey will be available in dozens of domestic United Club locations and in the airline’s U.S. United Global First Lounge locations. London Heathrow Airport’s United Club will also offer Buffalo Trace. Celebratory Flights \nLater today, United and Crafthouse will commemorate their new partnership with eight celebratory flights – four from Chicago O’Hare International Airport and four from Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport – during which customers may receive a free pour of Moscow Mule. \nThe celebratory flights are: \nFlight Number Departure City Arrival City \n1127 Chicago Denver", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:49:05.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
