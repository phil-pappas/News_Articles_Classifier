It is expected that the city accommodation sector, restaurant scene and visitor attractions could all benefit from the temporary increase in visitors.\nAlmost 600 gymnasts from 87 countries are set to compete in what is the main qualification event for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games. With an estimated global audience of around 800 million expected to watch the event on television.\nNearly half of the tickets have been bought by UK fans outwith Scotland, whilst America, France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany make up the biggest markets for overseas tickets sales. However, a number of tickets have also been purchased by spectators from long-haul markets such as New Zealand, Australia, Singapore and Brazil and less traditional markets such as Morocco, Taiwan and Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe competition has also captured the imagination of Scots with almost 12,000 tickets sold in Scotland.\nThe World Gymnastics Championships, which is supported by EventScotland, a team within VisitScotland’s Events Directorate, marks the continuation of a golden era for sporting events in Scotland’s largest city with the XX Commonwealth Games, the Davis Cup semi-final, the IPC Swimming World Championships and the Glasgow European Open Judo all staged in the city in recent years, with more major events planned for 2016 and beyond.\nLast year’s Commonwealth Games was praised for helping boost visitor numbers and enhancing the city’s global reputation for hosting world-class events.\nIn 2014, 622,000 trips were made to Glasgow by international visitors, an increase of around a fifth on the previous year. These visitors spent £245 million, up by a third on 2013.\nSimilarly, visits to Glasgow by those in the UK rose by 56 per cent in 2014, with more than 2.1 million trips made and a total of £442 million spent.\nMalcolm Roughead, VisitScotland Chief Executive, said:\n“The World Gymnastics Championships is, without doubt, one of the most spectacular sporting events to be held anywhere in the UK this year.\n“To have tens of thousands of visitors coming to Glasgow at what is traditionally a quieter time of the season is a gift for the city’s valuable tourism sector and a golden opportunity to promote its outstanding offering.\n“With an annual value of £3.5 billion, Scotland is the perfect stage for events. These events play a key role in our success as a tourism destination by attracting more visitors, raising our international profile and generating hundreds of millions of pounds for the country’s vital visitor economy.”\nCouncillor Frank McAveety, Leader of Glasgow City Council, said:\n“Ticket sales have already surpassed those of any previous World Championships and we are delighted that we have now passed the 50,000 mark. It is particularly pleasing that we have sold 20 per cent of tickets to spectators from more than 48 countries, underlining the global importance of this event.\n“The Championships will also be broadcast in the UK on BBC1 and BBC2 for the six days of finals (over 16 hours live) and will also be broadcast across the world in more than 73 countries by the FIG broadcast partners, including live in the USA, Germany, Netherlands, France, Russia, China, Japan and Brazil, with a total global audience anticipated in the region of 800 million. This will be a fantastic advert for Glasgow and Scotland, helping to drive tourism for many years to come.”\nSource:- Visit Scotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:54:22.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
