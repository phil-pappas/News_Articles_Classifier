SkyWork Airlines is amending its departure times from both London City airport (LCY) to Basel (BSL) and Bern (BRN) and those from London Southend (SEN) non-stop to Bern in response to customers' needs. \nThe winter flight schedule will come into effect on Sunday, 25 October. A positive conclusion can be drawn after a little more than 100 days of scheduled operations on the London City - Basel - Bern connection. The departure times from LCY will be amended slightly when the winter flight schedule starts: the morning flight to Switzerland will leave London at 8.05. The evening flight will now depart at 19.20. To offer our customers more flexibility with their scheduling, direct flights from London Southend to Bern (BRN) will also be adjusted. This flight will now run four times a week, departing at 13.20. The direct flight is particularly suitable for leisure passengers and is very attractively priced. Flying to Basel or Bern with SkyWork Airlines is a speedy and cost-effective means of visiting these cities for business or pleasure.
