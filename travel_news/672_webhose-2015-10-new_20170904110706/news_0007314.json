Chantal Nieuwenhuizen, the General Manager of LLOYDORR of South Africa, is personally in Seychelles with a television crew and this week interviewed Minister Alain St.Ange, the Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture, on the unique selling points of Seychelles. The Minister spoke at length on camera during the interview that was shot in the grounds of ESPACE Building that Seychelles is known to offer the best in a sun, sea, and sand holiday, but that it was realized that these unique selling points were today not enough anymore for the discerning travelers who wanted to take back home souvenirs with a taste of cultural. \"This is why we moved our culture to be at the center of our tourism development and marketing. In so doing, we have placed our people at the very center of our country's development,\" Minister St.Ange said to the television crew. \nApart from filming the Creole Festival, the television crew will be shooting the natural sights of Seychelles and the beaches on Mahe, Praslin, and La Digue. Amia Jovanovic-Desir and her team at the Tourism Board are coordinating the visit of the television crew. South Africa is a key source market for the Seychelles tourism Industry, and Air Seychelles now operates four non-stop direct weekly flights between Johannesburg and the Seychelles. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
