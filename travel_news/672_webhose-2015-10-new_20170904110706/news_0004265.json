She asks: What will the appointment of a small business commissioner mean for SMEs? Business writer Hazel Davis replies: The UK’s small businesses are owed £26bn in late payments and spend millions more chasing this money. As well as being downright annoying, this limits growth and productivity and has a considerable effect on the economy. The Government hopes the introduction of the Small Business Commissioner (SBC) will enable SMEs to resolve disputes and avoid future issues through the provision of information. It is hoped the SBC would help small firms access advice, support, mediation and conciliation services and have the power to look into complaints and report on the findings. Simon Young, founder of Aysgarth Chartered Accountants in Leeds, which specialises in looking after SMEs across the country, adds: We all know SMEs struggle to get paid on time. Some customers take too long to pay and then don’t like it when they are asked to pay up. If everyone paid SMEs promptly, or early, it would certainly help the economy. But if an SME is struggling to be paid, it’s unclear how the SBC will help. If a business owner does not want to upset his or her customer by being too aggressive in their debt collection, that customer might then be upset if the SBC contacts them. And then what? Large businesses will be able to hide behind their terms and slow processes. Also, we all know that late payment interest has not worked – I do not know an SME who actually uses it, even though we all have it in our terms and conditions. So why would an owner-manager turn to the SBC? The existing online court – Money Claim Online – works well but it does not always explain the process. The SBC website could provide a non-technical commentary on how to use Money Claim Online. However, if you need to collect debts from the court, then it ends up being a major drain on time, and sometimes resources, with little to show for it. A debtor determined not to pay can easily outwit the legal process and I fail to see how the SBC will be more successful. On the positive side, they will probably have a good website with lots of useful information, and the SBC will, hopefully, help to raise the profile of SMEs, so expect to see lots of Quote: s from them in the news. But otherwise I struggle to see how they will actually be of practical help in the real world. The Government claims that the SBC will be a signpost to other services, which is why I expect a nice informative website, but will people actually use it? Most of us instinctively turn to Google or contact a friend or professional adviser (I have some interesting conversations with my clients) so do we need to be “signposted” away from the SBC’s website? If you have shares in your own small private limited company, you are probably taking dividends of more than £5,000 – assuming there is a profit. But the SBC will have absolutely no power over tax or red tape, and these are the real issues that vex SMEs. Whatever challenges you face as a small business, you can protect your company with the right car financed the best way.
