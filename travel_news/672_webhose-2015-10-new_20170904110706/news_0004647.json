The new space, implemented by global design firm Gensler based on Cathay Pacific design, epitomizes Cathay Pacific's focus on flawless hospitality within its signature environment of comfort and elegant simplicity.\nSan Francisco is Cathay Pacific's US headquarters, where it first launched daily flights to Hong Kong in 1986, growing to a double daily service in October 2007 . The airline launched an additional three flights per week in June, bringing the total number of non-stop weekly flights from SFO to Hong Kong to 17.\nThe only Cathay Pacific-branded lounge in the USA first opened at SFO in November 2011 . It has expanded into an adjacent space, nearly doubling in size, from 5,500 square feet to a generous 9,220 square feet. Ample enough to accommodate up to 175 guests, this major addition is not just about elbowroom, it's a reflection of everything synonymous with the joy of travel and the Cathay Pacific brand.\nThe creation of a sensory, holistic experience for the modern traveller is integral to the Cathay Pacific design ethos and Gensler helps bring this vision to life. The result blends together the beauty, spirit and values of contemporary Asia with all the essentials for long-haul travel.\n\"Cathay Pacific constantly strives to improve our customers' travel experience,\" said Phillipe Lacamp , Senior Vice President, Americas for Cathay Pacific. \" San Francisco has been an integral port in our North American network since we launched a direct SFO to Hong Kong service nearly 30 years ago. The SFO lounge feels familiar to those who have experienced our renowned Hong Kong lounges, yet with a local flavor. With this lounge, we have created a stylish, harmonious environment that meets the fundamental requirements of the modern traveller, while offering sanctuary and breathing space from the demands of a hectic schedule.\"\nAesthetically, the finishes and character of the original lounge are synthesized into the new space. Classic luxury meets maximum functionality. Bathed in sunlight, the use of Carrara white marble and \" China Black \" granite creates a timeless elegance, while echoes of Asia are reflected in the warm bamboo finishes.\nFirst impressions are important, and the original reception wall of back-lit Venetian glass tiles, made by Fabbian of Italy , makes for an impressively stylish entrance. Natural light filters abundantly in through a panorama of windows, offering views across the runway to the hills beyond.\nThe upgrade focuses on thoughtful details with the individual traveller in mind. There are now 14 of the popular and innovative Cathay Solus chairs. Handcrafted by Poltrona Frau in Italy , the uniquely constructed chairs provide a rare measure of privacy for travellers to work, eat and relax in transit.\nEach lounge seat also now has adjacent power and USB power-only outlets for convenient recharging and powering of devices. An improved complimentary Wifi system is in place for ease of connectivity.\nTravellers can refresh and rejuvenate before boarding a long flight in one of the six Carrara marble and river pebble private shower suites (double the previous number).\nThose looking for the perfect pre-flight nourishment can enjoy a bite at the airline's signature noodle bar, where culinary classics like Dan Dan Mien and Wonton Noodle Soup are made to order. An improved, extensive menu has been added, plus a full-service deli counter offering a daily variety of freshly sliced meats, cheese and breads along with fruits, salads and marinated vegetables; and an Italian espresso bar is staffed by a barista . Fresh hot and cold Western and Asian dishes are also available at the self-service counter.\nThe lounge is open four hours prior to flight departure. Customers invited to enjoy the lounge are First and Business Class passengers traveling on Cathay Pacific, members of the Marco Polo Club with Silver Card status and above, and oneworld travelers with Sapphire status and above.\nAbout Cathay Pacific\nCathay Pacific Airways flies daily to Hong Kong and beyond, including over 22 destinations in Mainland China, from six cities in the USA and two in Canada : Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles , New York (JFK), Newark Liberty, San Francisco , Vancouver and Toronto ; and offers cargo flights to 16 cities across the Americas.\nMore information, including current fares and availability, may be found by visiting the airline's website at cathaypacific.com/us, Facebook page at www.facebook.com/cathaypacificus , Twitter @CathayPacificUS or Instagram @CathayPacific.
