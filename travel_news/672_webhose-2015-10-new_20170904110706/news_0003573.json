He chose Donsol in Sorsogon and Tubbataha Reef and Busuanga in Palawan to launch the initial tours. \n\n“I’m connected to those sites personally through my conservation work, so I am quite familiar with the operators, guides and how the sites are being managed. These are sites which value conservation of the marine environment,” he explained. \n\nYaptinchay believes that marine tourism is now ripe for development, as the Philippine Department of Tourism \"has taken solid steps in wildlife to regulate interaction with marine wildlife\". \n\nAs well, an increasingly mature visitor profile seeking quality over quantity will make such tours feasible. He added: “These days, people are seeking better, more unique experiences, with costs being secondary.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:41:23.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
