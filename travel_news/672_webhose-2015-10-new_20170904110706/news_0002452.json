Running Tours felt like the ultimate maximizing of time. \nBeautiful architecture? Check. Fun and interesting information about what I’m seeing? Check. Talking to, and getting information from, a local? Check. Safety? Check. Runner’s high? Check. \nSocializing and exchanging information with other runners? Well, check, if the couple who signed up for my tour hadn’t backed out, citing jet lag. The bonus for me was a private tour — a service Andersson offers as well. \nThe eight-kilometre “ Heart of Copenhagen ” route took us past the Little Mermaid statue in the harbour, Parliament, the royal family’s palace and through the city’s green spaces. \nA surprise for both Andersson and me was running right into a movie set for “ The Danish Girl ” starring Eddie Redmayne. No glimpses of the Oscar winner this day. \nWith my arrival from Calgary less than 24 hours earlier, the short stops to listen and learn helped me catch my jet-lagged breath. \nNinety minutes later I was full of endorphins and Copenhagen lore. If time is money, it was 195 Danish krone, or $35, well spent. \nAndersson asks group-run clients to be comfortable running a pace of about six minutes per kilometre, although she tailors private tours to other paces and distances. \nAmong the group offerings, there’s a 10-kilometre architectural tour as well as an eight-kilometre loop around the hippie neighbourhood of Christiania . \nShe’ll guide groups of up to a dozen. If more people sign up, Andersson will bring more guides. \n“There’s a huge parallel between runners and foodies,” she said. “Half my job is to provide restaurant recommendations as well. They want to know ‘where do we eat well?”‘ \nAndersson, a Copenhagen native, founded Running Copenhagen in 2011. Just over a year ago, she joined forces with Robin Florax of Running Tour Barcelona to launch Go! Running Tours. \nThe company now guides runs in almost 30 European cities and also has franchises in Singapore ; Cape Town , South Africa; Mexico City ; Guanajuato , Mexico; St. Thomas , Virgin Islands; and Sydney , Australia. \nLas Vegas and Chicago have come on board in the United States. Andersson is working on expansion to two Canadian cities. \n“We’re still very much in the first phase of people getting to know about us,” Andersson said. “If you look at the statistics, there’s so many runners and running is booming everywhere from North America to India to Israel. Low-cost airlines is the best gift for our companies. \n“What we see is that the same people run with me in Copenhagen, next month they are on a trip to Budapest or Prague or Athens. It’s the same people who join the tour in different cities.” \nIn North America there are several independent running tour companies. \nThere is also the U.S.-based chain City Running Tours, which operates in 16 cities, including the running meccas of New York City and Boston. \nRunning was always a portable sport.
