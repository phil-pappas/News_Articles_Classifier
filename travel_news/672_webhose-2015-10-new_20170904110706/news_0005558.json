Here we follow the highlights of the day. 1pm: Don Pollacco asks \"where are our alien neighbours?\" Kicking the festival off, Don Pollacco , professor of astrophysics and UK lead academic in the PLATO space mission, delivered a talk for school groups from the local area, telling them \"we will be able to look for intelligent life elsewhere in 10 years.\" Speaking to the Telegraph ahead of his talk, he said that while we may be a long way from finding \"aliens\" he believes that by the time the current 8 to 10 year-olds leave school, the discovery of intelligent life will be a real possibility. \"We could be very alone or there could be civilisations right next to us that we can’t communicate with.\" Don Pollacco \"It’s really exciting,\" he says. \"10 years ago, you’d have probably thought I was a nutter for saying this. 500 years ago you would have locked me up, but these kids will grow up with this.\" Whether intelligent life will speak to us, though, is another question, he adds. \"How long have we been technically capable for?\" he asks. \"We’ve had radio for 150 years, there have been humans for 2 million years, the earth is four billion years old, the universe 14 billion years. So if there is another civilisation out there, they are either going to be bugs on the floor, or a lot more advanced than us. Don Pollacco, professor of astrophysics at the University of Warwick \"It's impossible to imagine how advanced we would be in a million years, we would be completely different and unrecognisable with a million years of technology. That’s why this stuff about UFOs is rubbish. I don’t believe any of it. \"Any civilisation that could come here would be so far advanced from us, they might even be studying us. We could be very alone or there could be civilisations right next to us that we can’t communicate with , they will communicate with us when they want to.\" Find out more about the Festival of Imagination »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:44:35.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
