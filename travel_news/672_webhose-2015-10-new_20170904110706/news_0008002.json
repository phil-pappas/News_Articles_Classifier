In a survey that asked respondents to name the cities with the best international reputation, Sydney and Melbourne got the top votes — the first time two cities from the same country have claimed the first and second spots on the Reputation Institute’s annual City RepTrak poll. Tourists take photographs as they stand in front of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge on a hazy day October 21, 2013. — Reuters pic \n\nFor the survey, researchers collected answers from 19,000 respondents around the world, asking questions about their perception of a city’s economy, government, infrastructure, social policies, business environment and beauty. \nThe index ranked 101 international cities. \nIt comes as little surprise that Australia should dominate the list: The country has managed to be represented on the top five list over the last six years. \nBoth Sydney and Melbourne scored well across all categories and were also deemed the most livable cities in the world. \nConspicuously absent on the top 10 list, meanwhile, are US and Asian cities. \nThe first North American city to crack the top 10 is Vancouver, Canada, also a perennial favorite, which claimed the fifth position. \nThe first American city to make an appearance is San Francisco, in the 24th spot. \n“The overall reputation of a city is built upon direct experience, mass communication, third-party endorsements and broadly accepted stereotypes,” said spokesperson Fernando Prado in a statement. \n“These are bottom-line issues for local policymakers, because a good reputation strongly correlates with an increase in tourism, relocation and investment in that city.” \nOverall, the top 20 list is dominated by European cities — 15 of the top spots are in Europe. \nAmerican cities such as Boston, Seattle, Miami and Los Angeles dominate the second tier of the list and pulled off moderate scores, while the third and final tier is mostly made up of cities in Southeast Asia, Asia and Latin America. \nLanding smack dab last on the ranking is Baghdad. \nLast year’s top-ranked city was Vienna. \nHere are the top ranked cities on the Reputation Institute’s City RepTrak: \n1.
