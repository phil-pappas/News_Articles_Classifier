In her Spice Girls days, and even several years after, it was all about the labels, the large sunglasses, the diamonds, and the glamorously modern homes around the world. The taste in interiors was one that was nurtured by the friendship between Victoria and interior designer Kelly Hoppen , whose whitewashed, minimal aesthetic once fit perfectly with the family’s lifestyle in L.A., Dubai, and the South of France—until now.\nAccording to the British press , Victoria has replaced Hoppen with the more traditionally minded decorator Rose Uniacke for the renovation of the Beckhams’ nearly $50 million London mansion purchased late last year. Uniacke is a minimalist at heart, but she subtly and brilliantly blends the contemporary with the classic. As Victoria’s mode of dress has become more streamlined and sophisticated throughout the last decade, so too, apparently, has her taste in decor.\nThis style evolution—and the lavishly antique feel of Uniacke’s spaces—will perhaps bode well for the Beckhams’ purported country home-to-be in the Cotswolds . Listed as the most expensive country house in the U.K. at $41.8 million, the 10-bedroom estate was built in 1862 and has 774.32 acres of land, with neighbors who include Kate Moss , Damien Hirst, Elizabeth Hurley, and Sam Mendes. Though there has been no official announcement of the purchase, one thing is sure: If Victoria’s interior style really is taking a more traditional turn, this is the home that was built for her transition.", "external_links": ["http://roseuniacke.com/", "http://kellyhoppeninteriors.com/", "http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/style/homes_and_gardens/moving_on/article1427229.ece", "http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity/548974/david-and-victoria-beckham-s-32m-house-is-more-incredible-than-we-first-thought.html#index=1", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/inside-david-victoria-beckhams-27-6659025?ICID=FB_mirror_main"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:09:51.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
