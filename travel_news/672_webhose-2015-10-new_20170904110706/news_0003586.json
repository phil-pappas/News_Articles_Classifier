Most notably, the report found that Tribal Gaming operations are responsible for nearly 15,000 jobs in Arizona , placing Tribal nations in the top ranks of the state's employers.\n\"The Ak-Chin Indian Community has been a member and supporter of the AIGA since its inception and we strongly support their efforts,\" said Ak-Chin Tribal Chairman Louis J. Manuel, Jr. \"Because of the AIGA, Arizonans have come to understand that Tribal casinos are much more than entertainment, but provide a variety of benefits, such as much-needed financial support for important programs such as education and emergency services, that everyone in our state receives.\"\n\"Our industry has grown exponentially in the nearly 30 years since the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and in many ways the success of Tribal Gaming in Arizona has mirrored that of the commercial gaming space,\" said Valerie Spicer , Executive Director of Arizona Indian Gaming Association. \"But there still exists a need for continued opportunity to ensure that Tribal nations achieve economic sovereignty; we are not merely a commercial industry, rather our beneficiaries are entire generations of Indian people.\"\nJonathan Taylor of the Taylor Policy Group (TPG), a renowned economics and public policy consultancy specializing in Indigenous community research, produced \"The Economic Impact of Tribal Gaming in Arizona .\" Taylor's core findings of the study include:\nStatewide, Tribal Gaming operations employed nearly 15,000 Arizonans , a majority of whom are non-Indians. Tribal Gaming revenues fund investments in non-gaming economic diversification projects such as resorts, hospitals and fire stations, which employ thousands of additional Arizonans. When Tribal governments purchased and hired in 2014, they generated more than $2.5 billion in estimated gross state product, including $1.6 billion in labor income and $271 million in state and federal taxes other than income taxes. Under Tribal-state compacts, Tribal revenue underwrites important Arizona programs in education, tourism promotion and wildlife conservation. These contributions totaled $1.1 billion since fiscal year 2004, and amounted to nearly $98 million in fiscal year 2014 . \"The economic impact study highlights the fact that Tribal Gaming is integral to Arizona's business community,\" said Glenn Hamer , President and CEO of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \"With meaningful job creation throughout the state and significant economic diversification opportunities, Tribal business represents good business for Arizona .\"\nTo ensure data and information from the study is easily accessible to member tribes, the business community and the community at-large, AIGA developed an interactive app specific to the study that will be released at the upcoming AIGA EXPO .
