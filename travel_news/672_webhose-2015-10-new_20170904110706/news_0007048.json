This completes the delivery of the airline’s order of three Twin Otters in 2013, with the two other aircrafts already received in 2014. \nThe latest addition to the airline’s fleet will begin commercial operations as of now with both scheduled and charter flights. Mahe airport is connected to the archipelago’s second largest island, Praslin, with up to 178 flights per week while other islands like Denis – after which the aircraft has been named – Bird, Desroches or Fregate are served on demand. \nThe aircraft was en route from Calgary in Canada and had to perform a series of long ferry flights before reaching Mahe. The longest segment of the journey lasted over 10 hours and extended over 3.000 kilometres from Aswan to Nairobi with the overall distance measuring up to 16.770 kilometres. The ferry flights were performed by Air Seychelles’ Chief Pilot Turboprop Fleet Capt. Mervin Mondon. \nBesides a VIP welcome by Vice President Danny Faure, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Transport Mr. Joel Morgan and the airline’s CEO Mr. Roy Kinnear, 65 children from the President’s Childrens Village were invited as a special gesture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:45:59.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
