If you want the best tour package available, then choose a deluxe tour out of Vegas. The West Rim Is Only 45 Minutes Away It only takes 45 minutes to fly from Vegas to the canyon, so it's close enough for a quick day trip. The flight isn't wasted time since you'll see interesting things during the trip such as Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam. Visiting the canyon is a breathtaking experience. Seeing from a helicopter is hard to beat. Add in a landing tour where you can explore on foot and have some adventures and you'll double your fun. When you take a landing tour to the West Rim, you can opt for a tour package that lands   one that flies down to the canyon floor. One of the fun and popular tours that lands on the canyon floor comes with a champagne picnic, and you should consider booking it if you can. This is a very scenic trip since the chopper lands next to the Colorado River for the picnic, and you can enjoy the water view and the massive canyon walls above you. This tour comes with other upgrades too, such as a boat ride on the river and a flight to the top of the rim for some more sightseeing adventures. The Amazing Skywalk The Skywalk is on top of the West Rim, and you don't want to miss it. The Skywalk is a huge platform that's made from glass panels that lets you look down to the canyon floor 4000 feet below you. A walk on the Skywalk is the perfect way to top off an exhilarating helicopter tour of the canyon. Deluxe Tours You can choose a basic helicopter tour or upgrade to a deluxe one. While both types of tours provide fantastic views and a thrilling flight, the deluxe version has a few extra perks. One thing that separates the tours is that the basic tours lift off from an airfield in Boulder City, which is a suburb of Las Vegas. A deluxe tour costs a little more, but it is worth it. The tours utilize the state-of-the-art EcoStar sightseeing helicopters. The cabins are comfy, quiet, roomy, and they offer the best views available. The panoramic viewing window and roomy cabin are enough to make the extra cost worth it. Deluxe tours also provide you with free transportation by limousine, convenient lift off from the Vegas Strip and an aerial tour of Vegas that is quite beautiful at sunset when the lights come alive. Buy Your Tour In Advance You want to book your flight early, in fact, it's a good idea to book your seats when you book your hotel in Las Vegas. Since the chopper tours are so popular, they fill up fast, so try to get your tour purchased about two weeks ahead of time. Be sure to book your tour online too, because you'll save money. Buying your tour online is easy when you use your credit card, and it will qualify you for the low Internet rate and instant confirmation of your flight reservations. Get Ready For Some Fun Touring the West Rim by helicopter is an exciting experience you'll always remember. You have a lot of choices in add-on adventures, so you can create the perfect day on your Vegas side trip. Don't forget to buy your tour early and buy it online.
