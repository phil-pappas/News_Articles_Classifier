Theyve explored and enjoyed the city. The narrow lanes and the lavish streets, the bazaars and the Mughal mausoleums, the city of course has plenty to offer from a tourists point of view. \nYou probably live there or have been there so many times that you are well acquainted with the citys attractions. You know Delhi so well that you also recognize the hidden flaws a tourist would fail to catch. Now you want an adventurous outing away from the city with one single wish in your heart- that travelling came on a college budget. Youd be surprised to know that thats not much to ask for. Most adventurous destinations around Delhi totally understand your travel needs and have planned an economic trip just for you. All you need to do next is pack up and set off. \nWagah Border Where Two Countries Meet: Witness the Beating Retreat Ceremony and feel like you almost stepped into another country on your low-budget trip. You can make this trip your cheapest by choosing a bus to commute instead of a taxi and renting a guest house instead of checking into a hotel. Make sure you are at the venue between 3 pm and 4 pm so you dont miss the ceremony and are comfortably seated. After youre done, visit a few surrounding attractions and enjoy some flavorful food at a restaurant close by. \nChail A Piece of Nature: Weve all been to or at least heard of Shimla. It is probably one of the most considered destinations from Delhi for holidays. Think out of the box this time. Visit Chail, a petite village in the hills just about half an hour by car from Shimla. Of course it is a village and hence accommodation comes cheap. The food is fresh and cheap as well. What more can you ask for? You have fresh air, mesmerizing views, a piece of nature, budget accommodation, tasty and healthy meals and a perfect trip. Dont forget to visit the Chail palace. \nPushkar and Ajmer Its All about Peace: Get away from the hustle and bustle of your city and sway to the land of peace and tranquility. Im clubbing Pushkar and Ajmer because you cannot miss the breathtaking journey between both these destinations. The Lake and Brahma Temple are major highlights you should visit of a trip to Pushkar. Use the rest of the day to explore the rest of this gorgeous place and spend the night in Ajmer. This trip will serve as a medicine to the mind especially if you otherwise follow a hectic and busy routine. \nRamnagar A Trip in the Woods: If nature and wildlife interests you, Ramnagar is your holiday solution. Here you have a forest safari at the Jim Corbett National Park. The foothills of the Himalayas are ideal for bird watching. On a budget trip, check into a decent hotel instead of the luxurious forest resorts. This trip would be a blend of nature and adventure at a low cost. \nBarog - A Hidden Gem: This destination is a small village an hour before Shimla and 60km from Chandigarh. The highlight of this destination is the rail route. This is one of the most attractive railway lines around the area with the longest tunnel. Theres an abandoned tunnel that is obsolete now, above the station. You could hike to the tunnel on a visit here as well. The village was once used as a mere stop over, but today it is an exciting holiday attraction with mesmerizing views of the valley, pine trees, great climate and more. The hotels here are pocket friendly and so are the restaurants. \nNainital A Mesmerizing Lakeland: The budget is naturally low when its a holiday on the hills and Nainital is a blend of hills and lakes. You could choose to trek here or spend some romantic time with your spouse by the water. Theres Snow View peak and Tiffin top from where you can enjoy the beauty of the city from a birds eye view. The hotels here are pretty cheap here and hence you can gift yourself a budget stay amidst this naturally beautiful location.
