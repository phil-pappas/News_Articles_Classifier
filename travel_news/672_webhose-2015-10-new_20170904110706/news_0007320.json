Once you arrive on the Charles de Gaulle airport shuttle, if you prefer the unusual, visit some of the city’s lesser-known attractions. \nThere are many ways to explore Paris: you can see all the famous sights and eat at as many renowned restaurants as you can fit in; you can wander around streets less travelled at dawn and dusk and soak in the astonishing architecture; or you can simply rent an apartment and live like a Parisian for a week, buying bread at the local boulangerie, reading on a park bench and simply allowing the hours to slip by.These are only a few ways you can come up to enjoy the many and varied delights of Paris. But, as you sit on your Charles de Gaulle airport shuttle on the way to your accommodation and contemplate that you'd perhaps like to see Paris in a very different light, here are some hidden gems you should consider.Musée Zadkine: A Peaceful Spot to Draw the Afternoon AwaySmall museums can be wonderful finds in a city. They are often free, they are rarely busy, and they can be fitted in around the plethora of other things you want to do. In fact, if you ask your Charles de Gaulle airport shuttle driver for a recommendation, you may find him or her a wealth of information on lesser-known museums. One great example is the Musée Zadkine, found close to the Luxembourg Gardens. Hidden behind a small parking lot, this tiny treasure packs a punch for sculpture enthusiasts. Located in what used to be the atelier and house of Russian/French sculptor Ossip Zadkine, this is a truly inspiring place.You can often find art students here, drawing the various sculptures on display; in fact, visitors are welcome to stay as long as they please within opening hours, whether they are sketching away or simply taking a break from the busy streets outside.Bibliothèque Polonaise: The Refuge of the Polish IntelligentsiaIn the 19th century, numerous Polish intellectuals fled to France en masse to escape the Russian occupation and continue their various activities in peace. In Paris, they founded a literary society as a safe space in which to discuss their ideas, and from that point on, this library and its society became a refuge for Polish freethinkers, where philosophies were shared unreservedly.Nowadays, however, this space plays another important role: honoring Polish artists. Although the library is open for research purposes only, on the first floor there is a museum accessible to all visitors. The staff are dedicated and clearly adoring of its contents, and will be happy to provide lengthy answers to any questions you might have.The museum’s permanent collection primarily honors both the great Polish poet and dramatist Adam Mickiewicz and the superb Polish composer and pianist Frédéric Chopin. If you want to experience a small piece of Poland’s heart in Paris, this is the place to come. While you won't pass by this on your Charles de Gaulle airport shuttle, it's not hard to find on foot with a local map. Le Musée Gustave Moreau: An Artist’s Apartment Filled with His ArtEven if you've never given Moreau much thought, this quaint little museum is unquestionably a must-see if you're looking for hidden beauty in Paris.The apartment’s ground floor offers a fairly intimate insight into Moreau’s life, and through his bedroom and living room you'll find wall after wall full of his creations. At the foot of the stairs, in the corridor, you will find a huge sketch of Oedipus and the Sphinx, which runs from the floor all the way to the ceiling and leaves you wondering what marvels are hiding upstairs.If you follow the spiral staircase up to the first floor, you will find Moreau’s studio’s walls adorned with humongous canvasses. Easels are set throughout the room, showcasing a surprising variety of mediums and styles.Underneath the windows of the studio, however, lies the biggest surprise. If you pull up one of the readily available stools and sit in front of the drawn curtains, you will witness hundreds of original sketches, depicting subjects that range from animals to nudes. This is an ingenious display of the kind not easily found.Everywhere in this wonderful city lies a host of hidden historical and cultural gems just waiting to be discovered. These are just a few.
