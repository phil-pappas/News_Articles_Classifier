When the houseplants retreat back inside, and the porch furniture is put away, the mums remain as the last sentinels. As long as their bushy mounds of color remain, winter is kept at bay.\nMums are the rock stars of the fall garden. Hundreds of hardy cultivars provide an array of various colors and bloom shapes, so there's something for every taste and garden.\nBecause of their tight, mounded habit and stunning bloom cover, garden mums are perfect for mass plantings. Look around your yard to see what colors would best complement the existing landscape.\nIf you decorate for fall with pumpkins and gourds, choose orange, bronze, yellow, and creamy white chrysanthemums. If you have a lot of evergreen plants that provide a backdrop of varying shades of green foliage, try bright pinks, lavenders, pure whites, or reds. Mix several colors together, or stick to only one or two colors for maximum, long-range effect.\nSome mums can be kept over the winter to re-bloom the following year, but you've got to know how to care for them. Here are top things to know about mums; information comes from the Old Farmer's Almanac, the National Chrysanthemum Society , HGTV Gardens, SF Gate and Better Homes and Gardens.\nWhen choosing a chrysanthemum, your two basic options are \"florist\" or \"hardy\" mums. Florist mums are large-flower plants grown in greenhouses and used only as indoor plants. Florist mums can't survive cold weather. Garden, or hardy mums, on the other hand, can survive cold better. Some cultivars are less hardy than others and can be killed by an early spring frost.\nMums aren't as expensive as many perennials, so you can plant them as annuals without worrying that you've spent too much money.\nFor potted mums, cut off the flowers after they wilt, to encourage further blooming.\nIf you want something more permanent and are willing to provide proper care -- such as mulching and pinching to encourage compact growth and more blooms -- plant mums in the spring and allow them to get established in the garden. This will improve their chances of overwintering and re-blooming the next year.\nMost garden mums are perennials in Zones 5 to 9. Plant the mums in well-draining soil that receives full sun. Fertilize well to encourage blooms. If the mums produce spring blooms, pinch them back before late summer to encourage fall flowering. Before winter, cover plants with several inches of mulch or straw.\nLeaving the dead foliage on mums and asters instead of shearing for neatness will help hardy mums survive winter.\nMums grown as perennials need to be divided every couple of years. Plant each piece in a new hole with some organic matter and fertilizer.", "external_links": ["http://homeguides.sfgate.com/taking-care-potted-mums-65655.html", "http://www.almanac.com/blog/gardening-blog/mum-madness-invites-plant-disaster", "http://www.hgtvgardens.com/flowering-plants/mums-the-word-helping-these-fall-blooms-thrive", "http://www.mums.org/faqs/", "http://www.bhg.com/gardening/flowers/perennials/all-about-mums/"], "published": "2015-10-07T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:56:33.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
