The New York team complete a final four of sides to whom World Series glory is but a faded memory and, in the case of one team, not even a living memory. In the parallel American League Championship Series, the Toronto Blue Jays take on the Kansas City Royals . Two of these four teams will contest the World Series, starting October 27. And whichever team wins, it will be a rare taste of success. Between the four of them, they have a combined 188-year World Series drought. The Chicago Cubs last triumphed in 1908, an astonishing lean streak for one of the sport’s best-known franchises, and one that plays in one of TV’s bigger markets. The New York Mets, another big money, small success operation have not won since 1986. Created in 1962, they have won the World Series twice, but live in the perennial shadow of their neighbours: the New York Yankees have 40 World Series appearances and 27 wins to look back on. The unfashionable Kansas City Royals last tasted World Series glory the year before, in 1985. Toronto’s last triumph was in 1993. However, in terms of sporting pain, all bend the knee to Chicago. Their drought is the longest in USA professional sports. They have not even appeared in the World Series since 1945. One explanation at Wrigley Field has been the so-called Curse Of The Billy Goat. One Billy Sianis – owner of The Billy Goat Tavern and indeed owner of a goat that he took to matches – was ejected from the ground during a 1945 World Series encounter with the Detroit Tigers because the smell of the four-legged mascot was upsetting other fans. The furious publican said: “Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more.” He has, to date, been right. Is this the year the curse is finally lifted?
