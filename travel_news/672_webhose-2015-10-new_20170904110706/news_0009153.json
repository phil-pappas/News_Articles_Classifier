This clearly demonstrated the health of the UK's car and commercial vehicle manufacturers, along with the supply chains of business. Growing popularity for fuel-efficient vehicles, coupled with a need to reduce the vehicle weight greatly influenced the employment of magnesium die casting parts in the UK automotive industry.\nAbility to form casting with RFI and EMI shielding, high electrical conductivity, full recyclability, high impact & dent resistance, exceptional damping capacity, low inertia, higher scope of application as alternative to thermoplastics due to light-weight feature are some of the major factors driving the growth of magnesium market in the automotive parts die casting industry.\nMagic Precision Inc., Meridian Lightweight Technologies, MK Group of Companies, Morimura Bros Inc., Ryobi Die Casting Inc., Gibbs Die Casting Group and Georg Fischer Limited are some of the key players in the market.Availability of the raw materials in a large variety of semi-furnished forms, such as shape, castings, extrusions and sheet has become a major advantage to the die cast manufacturers. Such semis are very suitable for mass production and innovative solutions in the form of compact and highly integrated parts that meet the high demands for performance, quality and cost efficient manufacturability. Evolution of magnesium as engine block material by BMW, gaining acceptance of aluminum castings for many parts and innovative applications in the construction of space frame, axle parts and structural components are some of the major factors driving the Europe automotive parts die casting market in this region.\nThe market is segmented based on the production process type, by application type and by geography type. In a nutshell, automobile makers are now focusing on collaborating with the part die casting manufacturers in order to produce fuel-efficient and lightweight automobiles.\nOur Report Offerings\nThis report on UKautomotive parts magnesiumdie casting market, analyzes the current market trends in UK, in detail.\nThis report offers the technical aspects and economic data of the market and its forecast to the next 5 years (2015-2020).\nIt also discusses the latest technologies in the UKautomotive magnesiumdie castingalloys and parts that are under development and in research pipeline.\nThis report provides the list of major players in the market and gives an in depth analyst perspective of what makes the products and strategies of these players stand out.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03320465-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
