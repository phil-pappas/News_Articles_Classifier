Authorities have occasionally banned Muslim men under age 50 from worshiping at the site — Islam's third-holiest mosque — and young Muslims fear that further restrictions may be implemented. Tourists should check with local news sources before visiting the site.\nEl Salvador: Transportation officials reported that, despite increased security, crime remains an issue for those using the country's rail and bus transit. Among the crimes reported, theft and assault top the list, with most incidents taking place at bus stops and stoplights or stop signs, where assailants can escape quickly. There is an increase in theft, especially Thursday through Saturday. Tourists using public transportation should be aware of their surroundings and conceal valuables at all times.\nIndia: Malpe Beach, just six miles west of Udupi city on the Karnataka coast, has been closed through mid-October after seven people were stung by stingrays. Seventeen people were stung last September while visiting the same beach. Although the stings are not deadly, the venom causes severe but temporary pain and requires medical treatment. Stingrays approach beaches when water temperatures drop, and the creatures are expected to move on, leaving the beach safe again within the next three weeks.\nItaly: Six British tourists are facing charges after drunkenly stripping down and attempting to swim in central Rome's historic fountain of the Naiads, in Piazza della Repubblica. The tourists were fined and face trial for obscenity, which carries a maximum three-year sentence in Rome.\nMadagascar: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highly recommend polio vaccination before visiting the country, as nine new cases of infection recently were reported. It is recommended that adults receive a one-time booster shot if immunizations have not been completed. The disease usually is spread from person to person but also can be contracted through contaminated food or water. In severe cases, polio can cause permanent loss of muscle function, infections in the brain and even death.\nCompiled from news services and travel sources.
