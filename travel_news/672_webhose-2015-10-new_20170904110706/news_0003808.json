Time needed: Without stop-offs this drive would take up to four hours. But with so much to see, you should allow a full day. Key features: The Amalfi Coast is one of Italy's most scenic stretches of coastline and was awarded a coveted spot on the World Heritage list in 1997. Little wonder, with its meandering coastal roads through a landscape of painted villages terraced into hillsides and incredible views over turquoise waters. Where to stop: Ravello is one of the most romantic and beautiful small towns in southern Italy, once described by French novelist André Gide as being closer to the sky than the sea.

Your destination, Sorrento, is a popular but beautiful and sophisticated old town resort, with stunning views.
