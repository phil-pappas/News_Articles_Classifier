This update standardizes tire-safety education materials and provides a collection of new resources, including videos and hands-on exercises for instructors and students. The module will be incorporated into the ADTSEA 3.0 Driver Education Curriculum and will be made available for free download on the ADTSEA website at www.adtsea.org .\nIn advance of National Teen Driver Safety Week, Michelin and ADTSEA delivered the new tire-safety module in Miami on Saturday, Oct. 17 , at a free workshop for Florida driving instructors at the Marriott Miami Airport Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. A local tire professional from American Tire Distributors (ATD) supported instruction by providing outdoor tire-safety demonstrations.\n\"Michelin and ADTSEA have worked closely to create a new educational course that directly addresses the critical issue of tire safety for new drivers,\" said Sheryl Wilkerson , vice president of federal government relations for Michelin North America . \"Michelin is committed to reducing the number of preventable crashes involving teen drivers by providing simple tire-safety education tools and tactics that can help save lives.\"\nADTSEA (the American Driver and Traffic Safety Education Association) is the professional association representing traffic-safety educators throughout the United States and abroad. In March 2015 , ADTSEA received a $100,000 Teen Road Safety Grant from Michelin and the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Michelin and the FIA are calling for all 50 states to include consistent tire-safety information - about the importance of checking tire pressure and tread depth every month - in their official drivers' education materials by 2020, as part of Michelin's ongoing Beyond the Driving Test campaign.\nThe curriculum update for tire safety will be adopted by the six states that currently use the ADTSEA 3.0 for their states' driver education curricula: Hawaii , Illinois , Michigan , New York , North Carolina and Virginia . Additional states that use the ADTSEA program in addition to other curricula include Minnesota , Wisconsin and Utah .\n\"The new module is designed to equip driving instructors across the U.S. with an improved understanding of tire safety and new instructional resources to deliver this critical message to new drivers,\" said Allen Robinson , chief executive officer of ADTSEA. \"Thanks to Michelin, we provided this valuable training material in Miami at no cost to Florida instructors on Oct. 17 while rolling it out across the nation in the coming weeks.\"\nMichelin and ADTSEA will continue the initiative by delivering an additional free workshop in Long Beach, Calif. , in April 2016. The tire safety module is available for member state driving instructors online at www.adtsea.org .\nAutomobile crashes are the No. 1 killer of teens in America. Of the 2.2 million vehicle crashes taking place annually, 12 percent involve inexperienced drivers and tire-related issues such as insufficient tread depth or improper tire inflation. Teen drivers often lack the essential knowledge and skills that can help keep them safe on the roads, according to a recent survey commissioned by Michelin North America and the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body for world motor sports. This knowledge gap contributes to nearly 300,000 preventable car crashes involving inexperienced drivers each year.\nMichelin and FIA are making new resources available to help teens and parents brush up on their own car and tire maintenance skills, including a downloadable Glove Box Guide with important tips and this series of YouTube videos featuring popular teens.\nTo access additional educational resources, including Michelin's newest tire safety and maintenance videos, visit beyondthedrivingtest.com .\nAbout Michelin\nDedicated to the improvement of sustainable mobility, Michelin designs, manufactures and sells tires for every type of vehicle, including airplanes, automobiles, bicycles, Earthmovers, farm equipment, heavy-duty trucks and motorcycles.
