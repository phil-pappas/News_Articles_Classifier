Drivers can now start their car, lock and unlock doors right from their wrist. Other features include a car finder with a real time distance and map indicator, so users can find where the car is parked.\nOther features include speed limit alerts to avoid over speeding, driving history, and car cross alert to be notified if a car crosses a preset boundary. Additionally, you get car security control, and vehicle alarm notifications if the car is being tampered with right from your wrist. The Connect2Car system has unlimited range because it uses cellular connectivity to communicate with your phone.\nAccording to a company spokesperson, the Connect2Car Iphone, Ipad and Apple Watch application is available now in the App store . An Android version of the application is also available on the Play Store .
