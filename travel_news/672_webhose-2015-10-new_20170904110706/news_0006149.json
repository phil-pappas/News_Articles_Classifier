However, the good life came to an abrupt and painful end in 1955 when the apartheid regime forcibly removed the residents and relocated them to various parts of Soweto, most notably Meadowlands. \nThe city of Johannesburg considers Sophiatown as one of Jozi’s iconic locations that should be preserved for their heritage and celebrated for their contribution to South Africa’s cultural, artistic and musical landscape. \nThe 60th Anniversary Festival, organised by Tiffany’s Foundation, will be held at the suburb’s Extreme Park. “We endorse and encourage initiatives like this as they contribute to Johannesburg’s appeal as a fascinating and diverse tourist destination,” says Laura Vercueil of Joburg Tourism. \nFestival organiser Christo Morolong says the day-long programme will feature top performers such as Kofifi FM DJ Pops, DJ Yogi Bear, Ray, Die Afrikaans Volk Museik, Fikile Farrow, The Funk and Gospel Ensemble as well as Tswana and Zulu dancers. \n“Sophiatown represents the courage, character and determination of the South African people in protecting all that is truly beautiful. The forced removals of 1955 destroyed the homes and lives of thousands of people. However, it did not destroy their spirit,” says Morolong. \nHe says despite these atrocities, so many former residents and artists went on to be recognised as international ambassadors of the South African music industry. “Since 1994, former residents of Sophiatown have started to return to their heritage and to rebuild and rejuvenate it to its former glory. \nSixty years after the forced removals, we honour the heroes who stood for justice and a free and fair South Africa. \n“The festival will also showcase our long-term commitment to social cohesion and sustainable upliftment, and highlight the wealth of talent and entrepreneurship within the community. These are achievable goals that will create much-needed skills development and employment opportunities.” \nDance to be Wild, a conservation charity organisation, will highlight problems caused by wildlife crimes.
