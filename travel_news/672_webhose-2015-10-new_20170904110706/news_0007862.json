But when the underwear brand, sloggi came knocking for her knicker blessing, she was a natural fit.\nAs one of the world’s most popular bodywear brands, and a bestseller Europe, Kylie is the face and body behind Ever New — a relaxed, super soft, and unfussy range of undies for all shapes and sizes.\nKylie Minogue has been snapped by her pal and photographer Steve Shaw.

At least, I hope not! So much of my work involves fashion and it’s an\naspect that I love. Wearing beautiful clothes and working closely with some of the world’s\ntop designers is really a dream come true, but there are definitely times in my everyday life\nwhere fashion doesn’t come into play.\n•In three words how would you describe your style?\nOh, I always find that an impossible question to answer. I am such a chameleon that my\nstyle morphs depending on what the moment is. So I would have to have be simple,\nflamboyant, eclectic. This might sound contradictory, but I love to go from one extreme to\nanother.\n•Which is the item/piece in your wardrobe you love the most?\nA vintage leather belt. I bought it in 2000 from a second hand store somewhere in mid\nAmerica. It was already worn in then so it is definitely ‘well loved’ now, as I haven’t travelled\nwithout it since I bought it. Ever!\n•What characteristics should your everyday underwear have?\nIt should work for your comfort, confidence and your outfit. You you want it to feel so comfortable you barely know you’re wearing it, or wear items that help you feel strong, sexy or individual? We choose all our other clothes with these things in mind so I believe what you choose to wear under your clothes, the closest layer to your skin, is really important.\nNice all around, really ... Source: Supplied\n•Both as a woman as well as an artist which values of the sloggi brand you feel\nclosest to your personality/public image?\nsloggi has been a part of peoples’ lives for a long time and I have had the good fortune to\ndo the same for people around the world. We work hard, we want to deliver the best\npossible and have some fun while doing that.\n•Which aspects of your femininity do you believe will be emphasised by this\ncampaign? Hopefully the playfulness and happiness I feel when I am carefree and relaxed and it’s impossible to choose one style as my favourite. Choose a few so you have every occasion covered.\nOriginally published as Kylie’s sexy new lingerie shoot", "external_links": ["http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/03/1227555/338066-8edf5b28-6963-11e5-9095-42e6eb04e048.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/03/1227555/337447-8b795b6e-6963-11e5-9095-42e6eb04e048.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/fashion/kylie-minogue-a-master-of-reinvention-and-latest-lingerie-campaign-shows-off-her-inner-chameleon/story-fnet01u7-1227555296614", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/03/1227555/296560-39347306-6964-11e5-9095-42e6eb04e048.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:55:29.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
