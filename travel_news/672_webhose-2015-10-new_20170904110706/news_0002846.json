The El Tatio geysers in Chile are the third largest geyser field in the world.

The El Tatio geysers are famous for shooting scalding columns of water and steam into the air every morning.

Stepping over the safety fence at the Grand Canyon to get that shot is breaking that contract ... you’re putting yourself in harm’s way.” \nHere are some other popular spots where tourists go to extreme lengths to get a photo to show their friends and family. Cape Douglas, South Australia \nAlso in Australia, a 30-year-old woman died while trying to take a photograph of the rocky shore at Cape Douglas, near Mount Gambier, in 2010. She slipped and fell 50m down the cliff face. Mount Gambier.

Two years ago American tourist Rachel Gian, 26, died after falling into a ravine near the popular tourist spot. It follows the death of 73-year-old Werner Grimpen along the Inca Trail after a section of rocks came loose. \nWhile there’s no suggestion they were taking photos when they fell, Machu Picchu guides frequently warn people that tourists have plummeted to their deaths — or been severely injured — while trying to take the perfect snap.

Many tourists pose for photos while very close to the edge. Victoria Falls, Zambia.
