Source: Jovago.com \nAfrica offers a rich variety of cultural experiences, there is nothing quite like it. It’s an exquisite blend of the good, the bad and the ugly. The travel culture within the continent has yet to be completely embraced by Africans. \nIn many cases, if special occasions are not involved, the preferable thing to do is to stay put in the comfort zones but there is so much to explore in Africa. It is almost as though it is preferable to travel to “exotic” destinations in Europe rather than explore the fascinating places within the rich African continent. \nIn the process of planning most holidays, the true nature of travellers comes to bear - some are so meticulous that they book their holidays right down to the tee at least 3 months in advance and plan their destination’s itinerary perfectly. Sometimes, traveler profiles vary according to nationalities as culture and way of life could have a visible effect on one’s planning habits. \nThe “ Nigerian time” for example, is a phenomenon that is quite popular - showing up late for events, not getting things done on time etc. All these may point to the conclusion that Nigerians would not be the most meticulous lot in holiday planning. However as Africa’s largest population, it is quite difficult to make such generalizations. \nTraveller profiles range from the social traveller whose main focus at their travel destinations is to immerse themselves in the culture and enjoy relations with the locals to the ecological traveller who is fascinated by the nature and environment of the destination. \nThe purpose of travel could also determine the traveller profile in the planning process and also while at the destination - a getaway holiday could be meticulously planned by enjoyed as a social traveller with the perks of communing with the locals or as an ecological traveller aimed at exploring the flora, fauna and scenery of the holiday destination . \nInterestingly, one doesn’t have to be just one type of traveller - more often than not, the dynamic nature of man shows the ability to imbibe different characters at once. Do you think your nationality affects your planning as a traveller? What type of traveler do you think you are? \nAbout Jovago \nJovago.com is an online hotel booking service with offices in Lagos (Nigeria), Nairobi (Kenya), Dakar (Senegal) founded by Africa Internet Group and has MTN and Millicom as investors.
