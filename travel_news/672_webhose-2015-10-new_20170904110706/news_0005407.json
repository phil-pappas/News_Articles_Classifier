Wesley Case Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun How to make the most of a weekend getaway to lovely, charming Annapolis. \nIt had felt too long since we last visited Annapolis, but there it was — just as beautiful as we remembered. \nOn a recent sunny weekday, the city known as Naptown appeared just like the picturesque postcard its stores sell to visitors. Families and couples walked down Main Street, stopping occasionally to window shop, while Naval Academy students ran in groups by City Dock. \nIf you haven't visited our capital recently for a weekend or even a day trip, it is time to remind yourself of the charms only 30 miles south of Charm City. Whether you're planning a romantic getaway with a bed-and-breakfast reservation or want to instill some state history to your kids, Annapolis offers a rich experience filled with character and sights. \nAfter wandering around the area to find the new and old, we walked away with some recommendations to make your next visit a memorable one. \nAttractions \nNaval Academy : Visit the midshipmen's campus, where traditions — such as the plebe class' Herndon Monument Climb — have been proudly upheld for decades.

Belgian-themed restaurants, fry shops and bars have been cropping up in Baltimore lately.
