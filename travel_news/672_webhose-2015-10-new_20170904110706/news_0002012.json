The iconic Marco Polo German Bierfest at Marco Polo Hongkong Hotel which is the longest-running Oktoberfest celebration in Hong Kong will be celebrating its 24th year when it kicks off this 16th of October 2015 and runs for a 23 consecutive nights. \nThe phenomenal event has evolved to be one of Hong Kong’s annual signature events since its inception in 1992. Marco Polo Hongkong Hotel’s incarnation of the Oktoberfest has grown to be the ultimate immersion of this Bavarian tradition wherein regulars of all nationalities come in their dirndls and lederhosens. It all began with the love story of Bavarian Crown Prince Ludwig (who was later to become King Ludwig 1) and Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen. The citizens of Munich were invited to their royal wedding party that culminated into an anniversary party every year and has been celebrated ever since for over 200 years. \nThe most popular and its largest counterpart in Asia is celebrated against the breathtaking backdrop of Victoria Harbour at Marco Polo Hongkong Hotel where citizens of Hong Kong have been known to stage wedding proposals during the German Bierfest. There are many sides to a successful festival and the party spirit comes alive nightly with the Die Notenhobler band from Germany. Playing German folk and oompah music and as the evening’s energy goes on high gear, the stage becomes highly interactive with action-packed dancing and drinking games. One of the annual highlights is the Alphorn-blowing challenge, where members of the audience comeup to the stage to compete in showcasing their lung power to create their original mountain music from the three-metre Alphorn. \nKicking up your heels with the chicken dance and linking up arms with swinging beer mugs while swaying to German folk tunes is the minimum guarantee of experiencing the heart of the German Bierfest. There are the authentic Bavarian dishes freshly cooked under the watchful eyes of the Marco Polo Hongkong Hotel’s Executive Chef Rolf Jaeggi whose German heritage guarantees the best crispy pork knuckles in Hong Kong. \n“The award for “Best Experiential Event” has multiple dimensions in Marco Polo Hongkong Hotel’s version of the Oktoberfest!” exclaimed Mr Christoph Hoeflich, Hotel Manager and Head of Food and Beverage of Marco Polo Hotels – Hong Kong. “We would like to thank our associates and our partners who have brought über fun to our guests for the past 23 years. Join us and celebrate from 16 October to 7 November and get the chance to win two complimentary round-trip Business class air tickets to Germany courtesy of Lufthansa”. \nMarketing Magazine is Asia’s largest publisher of marketing and advertising news that is read by the region’s most influential and respected marketing professionals.
