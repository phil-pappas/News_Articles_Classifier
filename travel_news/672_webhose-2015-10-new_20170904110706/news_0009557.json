And with the government poised to decide whether to ratify the China-Australia free trade agreement, there are hopes that agriculture exports could become a new keystone of Australia’s economy.\nBut farmers say the sector is desperately underfunded, with research and technology, inland roads, better ports and human capital needed to make the most of the expected spike in demand.\nAnd, they warn, Australians can expect to pay more for milk, cheese, chops and steak, the products our northern neighbours are willing to pay a premium for — giving us all a reason to care about innovation in the sector.\nMustering at Macumba Station, Oodnadatta. Picture: Matt Turner Source: News Corp Australia\nAustralian Farmers Federation president Simon Talbot said the fact some of our most high-profile tycoons were buying into agriculture was a vote of confidence in the industry’s future, and could bolster its place in the national consciousness.\n“People get ire ore and coal. Well, agriculture can be just as big,” Mr Talbot said.\n“It’s one of the bright spots in the Australian economy.”\nHe said if international trade was opened up, agricultural exports to China could triple from last year’s $9 billion to $27 billion by 2021.\nMore conservative estimates forecast a doubling of the total export value of Australian produce to $82 billion by the middle of this century.\nFormer Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who has been working as an independent arbiter between Coles and its suppliers, warned that Asian demand and investment could drive up grocery costs.\n“As countries to the north start to establish and buy land here, that’s going to put a lot of pressure on farmers,” Mr Kennett told news.com.au.\n“The number of buyers around has increased, so therefore they’re selling more of their produce overseas. There’s going to be a reduced supply to Australia and if we’re not careful, that’s going to put up costs.\n“They’ve got 4 billion people, we’ve got 23 million; we are at a very real disadvantage.”\nJeff Kennett says Australians will have to pay more for their groceries. Picture: Tom Huntley Source: News Corp Australia\nMr Kennett said that while supermarkets had systems in place to secure the ongoing supply of produce, the ability to sell to overseas buyers at a higher price inevitably boosted their bargaining power.\nMr Talbot says this is a good thing, arguing that Australians have been getting too good a deal on their food.\nHe said retail price hikes on beef had not been passed onto farmers, and that any increase in saleyard prices could be largely absorbed by the supermarkets.\n“Producers have missed out all the way,” Mr Talbot said, calling on the federal government to push ahead with the free trade agreement.\n“Now we’re seeing more and more small food manufacturers looking towards Asia. I certainly think farmers are going to have incrementally stronger buying power.”\nVictorian farmer Peter Small, who exports to Japan, Europe and the Middle East, said sending prime cuts of meat offshore was nothing new.\nResponding to Mr Kennett’s comments, he said that while the free trade agreement could make way for cheaper fruits and vegetable grown overseas, “meat and dairy will go up” — and part of the blame for this lay with previous governments.\n“The only way to actually ensure that the Australian consumer has access to the best product is to produce more of the best product in Australia,” Mr Small said.\n“[Jeff Kennett’s] government, and most since the 1970s, have actually reduced expenditure on research in agriculture; now they’re going to reap the reward.”\nPeter Small exports beef, lamb and wool to the Middle East, Japan and Europe. Source: The Weekly Times\nThe 75-year-old, who runs Merino ewes, prime lamb, Angus cows and wagyu bulls on his family-run farm near Coleraine in southwest Victoria, deplores the lack of funding for agricultural research.\n“When I first started farming, the government saw it as being in the public interest to invest in research, because it delivers efficiencies and better products,” he said.\n“In recent decades, Australians had plenty of cheap food so governments have all diverted expenditure away from agriculture. What they haven’t seen coming is that the rest of the world can pay top dollar for Australian food.”\nMr Small welcomed investment by well-known billionaires like Brett Blundy, who is reportedly looking to spend $100 million and add two Northern Territory cattle stations to his portfolio.\nBut, he said, a few deals of this size would not be enough to shake up the industry.\n“An investment of that amount is not significant given the size of our agricultural industry,” Mr Small said.\n“If we are going to achieve the potential of the FTA, we’ve really got to marshall our resources to make it happen.”\nWhat the big names could do, he said, was “give others the confidence to actually say, ‘let’s invest in Australian agriculture’.”\nHe welcomed foreign investment, saying it would be impossible to raise the amount of capital needed domestically.\n“The good thing about outside investment is they come with enthusiasm and they come with money,” Mr Small said.\n“Often, they find that they can’t make it profitable so they sell out after 10 or 15 years. But if they make a big investment, that stays.”\nOn the market: Anna Creek Station in South Australia is the world’s largest cattle farm. Picture: South Australian Tourism Commission Source: Supplied\nEarlier this year, Kerry Stokes spent $4.7 million on a 3000-hectare cattle station on South Australia’s Kangaroo Island with his partner Peter Murray, according to The Australian Financial Review .\nIn June, retailer Gerry Harvey tipped $80 million into Australia’s dairy industry, snapping up the 2000-hectare Coomboona property near Shepparton in Victoria.\nAustralia’s richest person Gina Rinehart has also splashed out on dairy farms over the past year, buying 5000 hectares in Queensland’s Mary Valley as part of a $500 million joint venture with a Chinese baby formula producer.\nHigh net worth individuals are among potential buyers of a massive Northern Territory cattle station that went on the market in June, although the identity of first stage bidders remains cloaked in secrecy.\nThe property empire includes Anna Creek, the largest cattle station in the world, which has been owned by the family of well-known pastoralist Sir Sidney Kidman for more than a century.\nAs the largest private piece of land on Earth, it is expected to go for more than $1 billion, a deal that could be a major boon for Australian farming.\nSelling agent Don Manifold, of Ernst & Young South Australia, said the Kidman property had drawn potential bidders from Europe, Asia and North America, and that free trade negotiations were “adding to the tailwind”.\n“We’ve had a significant amount of interest in the sale from both Australian and international buyers,” Mr Manifold told news.com.au.\n“The people that are the most interested are either existing agricultural businesses or high net worth individuals, or global players that have an avid interest in Australian agriculture from a supply chain perspective, those people that believe there is a benefit of having Australia as part of its supply chain.”\nOriginally published as Why Australia’s rich are going bush", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/13/1227567/691420-0d6f7a00-715b-11e5-8a80-5a407624b6b3.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/13/1227567/692738-d3360c8a-7157-11e5-8a80-5a407624b6b3.jpg", "http://www.afr.com/real-estate/brett-blundy-could-spend-another-100-million-in-cattle-country-20151007-gk3ptb", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/why-australias-rich-list-is-buying-prime-farmland/story-fnu2q2e9-1227567692792", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/13/1227567/691338-e78bb1ec-7159-11e5-8a80-5a407624b6b3.jpg", "http://www.afr.com/real-estate/gerry-harvey-to-get-milking-in-80m-victorian-dairy-farm-deal-20150619-ghsas3", "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/13/1227567/692765-bac39dbc-7160-11e5-8a80-5a407624b6b3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:14:41.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
