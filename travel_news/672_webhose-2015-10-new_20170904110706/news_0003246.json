The goal of the UN's Women Empowerment Principles is to ensure human rights for women and to help women participate more fully in the economy, across all industrial sectors and levels of corporate hierarchy. Renault launched a women recruitment program in its Algerian factory that resulted in 350 new hires --40% of which were women. This makes the Renault plant in Oran one of the auto industry's best in the world for gender equity. Renault has a growing internal women network called Women@Renault which now counts more than 4500 members in key markets ( Algeria , Argentina , Brazil , Colombia , France , India , Korea, Morocco , Romania , Russia , Spain and Turkey ). In 2014, Renault received the coveted \"Label of Equality\" from the Spanish government. The government particularly praised Renault for its \"Women@Renault\" internal support and career network. Nissan introduced an official mentoring program for women manager candidates in Japan . The program is available for female general managers and offers reinforcement on issues of leadership, strategy and career advancement. Nissan launched a workshop for young women engineers. The workshop, which is held twice a year, offers women advice on how to build a career before having children. Nissan continues to expand the \"Ladies First\" retail program in Japan . Ladies First dealerships are managed and staffed mostly by women. The dealership in the Tokyo suburb of Fuchu features stylish interiors, a nursing room and a spacious area where children can play and is aimed at making the shopping experience more welcoming to women and first-time buyers. By the summer of 2015, Nissan had 151 Ladies First dealerships. Nissan plans to have 300 across Japan by the end of 2016. It is also considering expanding the program to overseas markets. Nissan will take lessons learned from the \"Ladies First\" project and apply it wherever applicable. Nissan is also boosting the percentage of women salespeople. Women represented 8.5% of salespeople in Japan in mid-2015, up from 7% at the end of 2014. Nissan aims for 10% by 2018.
