I've written before about Priority Pass (prioritypass.com), a program that provides access to more than 700 airport lounges, with three options: Pay $99 a year plus $27 per visit; pay $249 per year, including 10 lounge visits, or pay $399 a year for unlimited visits. Participating lounges are a mix of airline clubs and independent airport lounges. Unfortunately, the list of locations is weak in the United States, at just 23 airports, but coverage in the rest of the world is excellent.\nAgain as previously noted, the typical lounge provides a relaxed atmosphere, comfortable seats, and, in most cases, no-charge full bar and snack service and computer areas with Wi-Fi. For that reason, I've advocated that lounge membership can be an attractive splurge for many travelers trying to escape the hostile airport environment.\nPriority pass provides that escape -- and you don't have to have a high credit score or sign up for an expensive credit card to enjoy it. But I've recently seen an interesting new development: Priority Pass is \"wholesaling\" to other membership programs that combine it with other features and services, sometimes at a lower price.\nSome new operations combine Priority Pass with a 24/7 \"concierge\" service, similar to those offered by high-end credit cards, that will arrange almost anything you can think of for your trip. You pay, obviously, but the concierge runs the errands and makes the calls to locate what you need. A few years back, for example, my credit card's concierge program scored a pair of tickets to a sold-out performance at the Vienna Opera on a day's notice.\nRegal Card. This relatively new membership program includes full Priority Pass access plus extras. It offers two levels of service:\n-- Regal Lounges package, including full Priority Pass, access to discounted consolidator tickets in business class through the card's parent company, a large business-to-business ticket wholesaler; along with a bunch of hotel perks (based on availability) such as late check-out, upgrades, and free breakfast and members-only promotional deals. The current cost is $329 per year -- less than Priority Pass charges.\n-- Regal Card package, adding full concierge service, year-round travel insurance including medical (maximum age 75), $250 deductible and 80 percent payment of next $5000, plus lost baggage, delayed baggage, and modest trip interruption. This is certainly not gold-plated travel insurance, but the full-year coverage is a big plus for anyone taking multiple trips each year. This package costs $450 per year.\nRegal Card's website is a bit ambiguous: log into theregalcard.com/update/ for access to full pricing details.\nPana. This app (download from pana.com) focuses on the concierge element of TLC. It offers three options:\n-- Standard, at $25 per month, provides 24/7 concierge service plus \"Access preferred rates, upgrades, and rewards from our exclusive portfolio of hotels and airlines,\" which may or may not be useful to you.\n-- Lux, at $250 per month, adds full Priority Pass plus global crisis protection.\n-- Escape, a \"free\" vacation booking service to be launched later.\nAll in all, this doesn't seem to offer the same value proposition as Royal Card. But the current offer includes a free seven-day trial, so you don't risk anything by giving it a shot.\nClearly, programs that cost upwards of $300 a year aren't for everybody. But I suspect that personal concierge attention will become increasingly attractive as the process of searching for the best deals becomes increasingly complex. You can no longer rely on the standard online aggregators or travel agencies to locate and compare the options quickly and inclusively. Concierge service gives you access to professional assistance.\nBut so, too, does a local storefront travel agency. I recently received a press release that started out by saying, \"The days of using travel agents to plan travel are fleeting and nearly vanished completely.\" Don't believe it: Travel agent business is growing, not shrinking. Whether you choose face-to-face or online concierge, professional help is more important than ever.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins(at)mind.net.
