It has become such an issue the staff at the Eiffel Tower went on strike to protest the lack of security.\nTrue to form, one of the members of the group we were travelling with on our most recent trip to France was pickpocketed, not in Paris, but in Nice.\n\nRon Pradinuk / Winnipeg Free Press Wherever you travel around the world, whenever there are crowds, there are likely pickpockets nearby. \nHis cellphone was the target, as was that of another associate who had his phone stolen in Paris last year. In his case, he left the phone lying on the restaurant table when a clever scam artist approached him for directions. She laid a map over the phone on the table to point out where she wanted to go, and deftly palmed the phone as she left.\nIt is not just a problem in France. Pickpockets are a scourge in all the major cities around the world. This only underscores how diligent we need to be when we travel. Scams are all too plentiful in the travel business. They are successful because, in our excitement over what we are experiencing, we don't take enough care with our belongings.\nIn the past, I have offered some of the ways you can protect yourself. In in this column, I will add to that list.\nWhile there are occasionally hotel room break-ins, they are few and far between. Try to leave as many of your valuables as you can in your room when you go out for the day. While using the hotel room safe is a good thing, most of these are not hard to break into if real thieves wish to do so. I have established a habit of spreading some of my valuables through the various bags I travel with. The most important thing is to establish a routine as to where you store them.\nMore than one person has lost items because they could not remember where they hid them. But, at least if they are in possessions you own, if you can't find them when you check out, you know they are somewhere in your belongings.\nYou never want to forget where you hide a passport. That memory loss could result in a substantively longer holiday than you had planned.\nDay packs, as they are called, are a common addendum for visitors wandering through city streets. Putting one of these by your table as you go to a washroom, even if you are with another person, is an invitation to steal. Likewise cameras, always prime targets for thieves, need to be attached to a strap.\nPerhaps equally important, when things do go badly, you need to be able to get back on track as quickly as you can without ruining your vacation emotionally or financially.\nBefore you leave home make sure that you have made copies, and even extra ones for a travel companion, of tickets, passports, medicines, itineraries, lost credit card contact numbers and, especially, prescriptions.\nI have written about the use of money belts and other security bags for a long time. That advice cannot be repeated enough. And separating credit cards and other valuable information is equally important, so that if you are parted from any of it, lost or stolen, you have access to another credit card or other monies.\nWhile often your theft insurance may be sufficient to replace stolen items, and even though you will likely want to deal with the paper work when you get back home, it is worth taking copies of your policies with you on your trip. You can contact the insurance company and start the process while you are away, and always report thefts to the police, even though they are not likely to be rushing out to take your information in cities that report pickpocketing and other scams on the hour.\nVacation home and apartment rentals have grown dramatically in popularity in recent years.\nOne of the more recent scams centres on these companies.\nPeople have to be careful they are, in fact, going to get the property shown on the website advertisements, and do everything they can to make sure the advertiser is real. More recently, another form of scam centred on this sector has robbed victims of thousands of dollars.\nUsing the phishing method of finding victims, a renter who has already paid for accommodation in advance receives one of these emails informing the client the credit card transaction was not completed successfully. The email's sender asks for money instead.\nWithout checking to see if the credit card was processed by the real property owner, the victim wires funds immediately to the scammer in order to secure the reservation.\nThe scammer, unfortunately, has already used the same phishing method to get the property owner's information, to the degree they contact organizations such as Airbnb or HRBO to change the profile to their own.\nThe victim has no reason to believe it is a scam, because the email appears to be coming from the owner via one of these company accounts.\nEvery time I write a column trying to help travellers avoid scams, I am concerned it will have the opposite effect than intended, and people will become fearful of travel. The travel experience is just too satisfying, and I hope readers will never be deterred by fear because of a raised awareness of the darker side of tourism.\nMost people who travel never encounter such challenges. But the more precautions you take ahead of time, the less likely they will ever happen to you.\nPradinukr@shaw.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:24:36.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
