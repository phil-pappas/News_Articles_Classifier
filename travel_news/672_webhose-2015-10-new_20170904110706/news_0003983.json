The government is expected to make a decision in December.\nAlthough the Stanley Hotel did not feature in the 1980 film, The Shining, the set did take inspiration from the site\nNow, the hotel is looking to further capitalise on his spooky history by adding a horror-themed museum, auditorium, film production studio and film archive\nThe 109-year-old hotel is full of eerie features, which makes it the perfect location to inspire such a scary story\nBefore the proposed project can get underway, however, the state government will need to approve millions in funding\n'At 109 years old, the story of the Stanley Hotel is just beginning,' hotel owner John Cullen told Inquisitr . 'The Stanley Film Center is my chance to give back to the millions of horror fans around the world who have supported Estes Park and the hotel for so many years.'\nAs the model for the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, this isn't the first time that the hotel has capitalised on its spooky history - it also offers seasonal ghost tours and hosts a horror film festival.\nAnd of course, The Shining plays on loop on one of the TV channels in each room, no matter the time of year.\nRead more: What's scarier than 'The Shining' hotel in Colorado?
