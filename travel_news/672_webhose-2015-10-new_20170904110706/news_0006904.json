(NYSE: AHT) (\"Ashford Trust\" or the \"Company\") announced today its preliminary RevPAR results for the third quarter of 2015. The Company expects to report RevPAR growth for all hotels in the portfolio of approximately 5.0% for the third quarter.\n\"While RevPAR growth in the third quarter was negatively impacted by a couple of calendar events, namely the shift in the Labor Day holiday to one week later than last year, as well as the shift of some holiday dates both of which led to a sizeable decrease in business travel during the quarter, Trust's RevPAR growth of 5.0% illustrates the benefits of its geographically diversified portfolio,\" said Monty J. Bennett , Ashford Trust's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We continue to see very positive industry dynamics and believe that those favorable fundamentals will drive solid RevPAR growth going forward.\"\nAshford Hospitality Trust is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing opportunistically in the hospitality industry in upper upscale, full-service hotels.\nFollow Chairman and CEO Monty Bennett on Twitter at www.twitter.com/MBennettAshford or @MBennettAshford.\nAshford has created an Ashford App for the hospitality REIT investor community.
