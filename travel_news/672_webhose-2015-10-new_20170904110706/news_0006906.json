Grasshopper Adventures, whose cycling tours are rated as the number 1 Outdoor Activity in Bangkok, have now opened a new branch in Chiang Mai and have launched three new cycling day tours to explore the city.\n‘Charming Chiang Mai’ is a full day tour visiting many of the city’s highlights including the Navel of the City, Wat Chiang Man, Wat Chedi Luang and the Worarot Market. A delicious local lunch is included in the tour along with Grasshopper’s usual high quality bikes (with helmets and water bottles), guides and snacks. The 14km ride is easy and relaxed with most of the distance being covered on back road and alleys, making this an idea tour for families with young children.\n‘Bike Historic Old City Chiang Mai’ is a shorter, half day version of ‘Charming Chiang Mai’ covering highlights within the old city walls. 11km in length the tour is also suitable for children.\nWhile Chiang Mai has a range of bike tours, and a variety of food tours, until now there hasn’t been a food tour by bike on offer. The new ‘Chiang Mai Food Adventures by Bike’ fills this gap with a half day evening ride taking cyclists on a tour de force of Chiang Mai’s street food, juice stalls and markets. Experience not only traditional Chaing Mai cuisine, known as Muang Food, but also sample Shan and Tai Yai delicacies. With some historical sites of interest thrown in this tour has something for everyone, vegetarians included. As much of this tour is at night, it is not suitable for kids riding alone, however child seats and tag-alongs are available.\nTour Info\nCharming Chiang Mai:\nDeparts daily at 09:00\n1,300 Thai Baht per person\nDistance: 14km\nBike Historic Old City Chiang Mai:\nDeparts daily at 09:30\n950 Thai Baht per person\nDistance: 11km\nChiang Mai Food Adventures by Bike:\nDeparts daily at 17:30\n1,650 Thai Baht per person\nDistance: 12km\nMedia Contact: Holly Barber, Grasshopper Adventures\nemail: editor@grasshopperadventures.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:14:05.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
