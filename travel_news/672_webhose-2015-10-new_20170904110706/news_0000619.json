The flooding started at around 4:00 a.m., with water levels reaching some 3.50 meters (11.5 ft) in some areas.\nEmergency response agencies reported only material losses, mainly damaged food, furniture and appliances.\nOmar Lizano, top oceanographer with the University of Costa Rica’s Marine Sciences Research Center ( MIO-CIMAR ), said the high tides were due to the nearness of the moon to the Earth, and of the Earth to the sun.\nExperts expect a new high tide at 4:13 p.m. today, which could exceed 3.12 meters (10.2 ft). They’re also forecasting another high tide at 4:40 a.m. Thursday, which could reach 3.28 meters (10.7 ft).\nLizano noted that a similar situation occurred 18 years ago, and coincidentally when the country was also under the influence of an El Niño weather phenomenon.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:26:39.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
