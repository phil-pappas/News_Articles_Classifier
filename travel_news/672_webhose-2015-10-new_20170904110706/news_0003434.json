Others prefer the gentle cajoling of a creamy latte . Few of us – frantic journalists aside – opt for caffeine after 3pm, aside perhaps for a single shot to chase down a satisfying evening meal. Coffee-based cocktails, however, are an entirely different proposition and intriguingly, the later the hour, the more tempting they become. It is unclear if their resurgence in popularity has been fuelled more by flagging mixologists or off-duty baristas. Either way, they are going down a storm in night clubs, bars and licensed cafés from New York to Noosa. Here are five that place a lovingly brewed espresso at their fluttering heart. Siciliano The Siciliano rolls the joys of a Sicilian terrace bar, quaint caffetteria and sun-drenched orange grove all into one and still manages to be cool and sophisticated. • 60ml sweet vermouth • 50ml amaro (Fernet Branca or Amaro Lucano) • 60ml double espresso, cooled • 25ml sugar syrup • Soda water • Fresh orange rind In a large cocktail glass or champagne coupe, mix the vermouth, amaro, coffee and syrup. Add ice to fill and top with a dash of soda. Garnish with orange rind. Coffee club: give your cocktail a kick with this Kiss Good Night recipe Photo: Getty De’Longhi Kiss Good Night If you are a fan of the fruity, fragrant single-estate coffees of Ethiopia then this fruity herbal coffee cocktail will appeal. • 25ml whisky • 30ml shot of espresso, cooled • 25ml of sweet white vermouth • 1tsp of cherry liqueur • Dash of Angostura bitters Simply stir ingredients in a cocktail shaker and serve in a cocktail glass with a sprig of thyme and twist of lemon rind. Espresso Martini The espresso martini emerged from Soho late one night in the Eighties and never looked back. It requires some effort to generate the froth, but it is well worth it. • 50ml vodka • 35ml coffee liqueur • 1 30ml shot of espresso, cooled • Ice Place ice in a martini glass to chill, then discard. Place the vodka, liqueur and espresso into a cocktail shaker. Add fresh ice cubes, close and shake vigorously. Open the shaker and place the strainer on top. Pour the contents through a fine sieve (tea strainer) held in your other hand. This helps create a smoother froth. Garnish with coffee beans. Cool and sophisticated: Dublin Iced Coffee is a delicious mix of cocktail, caffeine and dessert Photo: StockFood Dublin Iced Coffee Really eye-catching and surprisingly refreshing. You could even get away with this at lunchtime on a warm Summer’s day, if the fancy takes you. • 1 double espresso (60ml) cooled • 60ml Guinness (or other stout) • 50ml Jameson’s (or other Irish whiskey) • 20ml sugar syrup • 20ml double cream • Ice cubes In a highball glass mix the coffee, stout, whiskey and syrup. Add ice to fill. Pour the cream slowly over the top and allow it to sink, creating a swirling, marbled mocha effect. Tiramisu Martini If the espresso martini sounds just a little too energetic, here’s a relatively easy, even more indulgent alternative that you can happily serve in place of dessert. • 25ml Amaretto • 25ml vodka • 25ml Baileys Irish Cream • 60ml double espresso, cooled • 60 per cent dark chocolate to garnish Mix the Amaretto, vodka and Baileys in a shaker with ice and strain into a chilled martini glass. Top up the glass with the espresso and garnish with finely grated shavings of dark chocolate.
