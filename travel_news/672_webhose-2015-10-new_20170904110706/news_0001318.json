The boutique property sits on the banks of Lake Geneva, in Switzerland.\n \nFollowing an extensive renovation, the hotel is scheduled for re-launch at the end of 2016 as The Ritz Carlton, Hotel de la Paix Geneva. The lakeside property plans to undergo a comprehensive renovation which includes reducing the number of hotel guestrooms to 75 stunning luxury accommodations.\n \nEmbedded between Alpine peaks and the hilly terrain of the Jura, the French-speaking city of Geneva lies in the bay where the Rhone leaves Lake Geneva. With its humanitarian tradition and cosmopolitan flair, the European seat of the United Nations and headquarters of the Red Cross is best-known as the capital of peace. Water flows through the center of the city into the River Rhône and museums, shops, restaurants, and parks jostle for space on the history-laden south shore known as Rive Gauche. Busy shopping streets underline the hilltop Vieille Ville, Eaux-Vives is to the east and the Plaine de Plain Palais lies to the west.\n \n“It is an honor to bring The Ritz-Carlton experience to Switzerland,” said Herve Humler, President and Chief Operating Officer, The Ritz-Carlton. “Geneva is a highly desirable destination for travelers and we will now be able to offer a sensational travel experience to complement the full portfolio of Ritz-Carlton properties around the globe,” he added.\n \nRecently named as the world’s most popular luxury hotel brand by London-based consultancy, Luxury Branding, The Ritz-Carlton currently offers a collection of ten luxury hotels throughout Europe including The Ritz-Carton, Abama, The Ritz-Carlton, Almaty, The Ritz-Carlton, Berlin, The Ritz-Carlton, Herzliya, The Ritz-Carlton, Istanbul, The Ritz-Carlton, Moscow, The Ritz-Carlton, Vienna, The Ritz-Carlton, Wolfsburg, Hotel Arts, Barcelona and Penha Longa Resort & Spa in Portugal.\n \nSource:- Ritz-Carlton Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:36:58.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
