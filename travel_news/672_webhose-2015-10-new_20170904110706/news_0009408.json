Even so, we can't stop our imaginations. Eye to eye\nThose for whom flying means getting lost in a book or film while politely ignoring their neighbors probably won't enjoy the designs from Zodiac Seats France.\nIts Economy Class Cabin Hexagon consists of a tightly packed jigsaw of alternating backward and forward seats, making it difficult to maintain the number one rule of traveling on any form of public transport -- avoiding eye contact.\nNot to be outdone, Boeing has filed its share of eccentric patents, such as their \"upright sleep support system.\"\nIts purpose is to help passengers rest during a flight by letting them lean face-forward into a cushion that has a hole to accommodate eyes, nose and mouth.\nAnother cushion supports the chest and both are deployed from a backpack attached to the seat.\nPassengers may, however, run the risk of looking like they've overindulged in inflight alcohol.\nAll in your head?\nIf the grim reality of air travel is too much to handle, why not escape your surroundings with the help of a sensory helmet ?\nThe Airbus-patented headwear could isolate passengers from sound, sight, smell -- or all three at once -- for a more pleasant and relaxing journey.\nPresumably this would come in handy if the person in front has lowered the back of their seat and the baby next to you has just had an accident.\nThe science fiction-like helmet would fit in with the company's vision for the airplane of the future, which might look like a donut if Airbus has its way.\nThe patent for its futuristic-shaped aircraft looks like the plane is hoisting the popular pastry on its back, complete with a hole in the middle.\nAccording to Airbus, this configuration can fit more passengers and distribute cabin pressure more evenly.\nJUST WATCHED Would you ride in a 'flying doughnut'?
