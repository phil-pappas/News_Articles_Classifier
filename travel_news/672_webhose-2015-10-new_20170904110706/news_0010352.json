I’ve always admired the charity, and it’s a great privilege to be a part of it. I have been with the RSPCA for the past four years. Putney Animal Hospital, where I work, has a real sense of purpose. It’s a great environment and I get to expand my clinical experience and pursue my specialism in cardiology. Most importantly, we share a commitment to the RSPCA’s vision that all animals are respected and treated with compassion. The Home for Life scheme gives you the peace of mind that, should you pass away before your pet, the RSPCA will do all it can to rehome your pet The best thing is seeing animals restored to health and responding to love and care. I recall a recent case of a dog with extensive burns. His owner had poured boiling water over him because they thought he barked too much. It’s hard to believe how cruel some people can be. Fortunately, we relieved his pain and the dog regained his lust for life. Saving badly treated or injured animals is the most important part of my job. It’s why donations are so key, whether you give monthly or leave a legacy gift in your will – legacies pay for half of all the work we do at the RSPCA, and are crucial to the charity’s survival. One cat, Lucky, sticks in my mind. She had been run over and we performed emergency surgery to repair ruptured muscles and a torn bladder. We worked until 3am but, as it always is, the effort was worthwhile. All staff share a commitment to the RSPCA’s vision that all animals are respected and treated with compassion At work we deal with lots of injured strays as well as cases of abandonment, such as unwanted kittens who are too young to be able to survive without their mothers. We hand-feed them until they are old enough to be transferred to one of our animal centres and then rehomed with a loving family. Fortunately, not all animals that come through our doors are abandoned. The RSPCA’s Home for Life scheme gives you the peace of mind that, should you pass away before your pet, the RSPCA will do all it can to rehome your pet with loving new owners. No place like home Jean Jago wasn’t planning on getting a new dog for a while when her elderly labrador-cross died. “I’d decided to go abroad on holiday,” she says. “But it didn’t quite work out that way.” That was thanks to a phone call from Mrs Jago’s local RSPCA centre. As a volunteer there, Mrs Jago had a history of fostering dogs until they found permanent homes. “Rosie is a terrier-crosspoodle who had come in via the RSPCA Home for Life scheme, which rehomes animals with a new family if their owner dies,” she says. “I agreed to take her in while she waited for a dental operation, after which she would be adopted. “Well, Rosie had other ideas. She immediately made herself at home, and there was no question of her going anywhere. You could say that she adopted me.” As you would expect, Mrs Jago and Rosie are now firm friends who love each other’s company. So does the dog lover ever rue her missed trip? “I’ll get my foreign holiday one day,” she laughs. “But Rosie is my focus just now.” Find out more about how you can leave a gift in your will here or call 0300 123 0239.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:51:36.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
