Additional programs cost extra. \nTurtle Hospital; entry $18 for adults, $9 for children. Reservations recommended. \nIslamorada \nThis string of islands scattered between Florida Bay and the Atlantic Ocean has earned the nickname \"the sport fishing capital of the world.\" \nAs it travels north, the Gulf Stream brings a steady flow of sailfish, tuna and kingfish past the waiting hooks of Islamorada's anglers. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:48:14.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
