Whether you want to tie the knot somewhere a bit exotic overseas or at a venue that feels closer to home on a ranch or farm, these six master planners share their favorite locales for the season’s most breathtaking (and vacation-worthy) destination weddings.\nFeriye Restaurant , Istanbul, Turkey\n“The Ottoman sultans originally built Feriye in the early 19th century, and today it is one of the premier restaurants in Istanbul. It’s located right on the water of the Bosphorus and features traditional Turkish cuisine. You can celebrate in a tent right on the water, perfect for arrival by boat or for viewing fireworks late at night.”\n—David Stark, David Stark Design\nThe Wedding Deck at Vail Mountain , Vail, Colorado\n“The Wedding Deck at the top of Vail Mountain is nature’s best ballroom, especially when the aspen leaves change to a vibrant red. This spot is 1,000 feet above sea level and accessible only by gondola, so it’s not necessarily great for a huge wedding—though it’s incredibly majestic. You can start with sunset cocktails to take in the view, and then tuck into a warm tent for dinner and dancing. It’s important to make sure you have plenty of heaters, blankets, oxygen, and, of course, vodka on hand.”\n—Bronson van Wyck, Van Wyck & Van Wyck\nThe Ranch at Rock Creek , Philipsburg, Montana\n“Fall really is my favorite time on the Ranch. Located in the heart of western Montana on an authentic homestead, the Ranch at Rock Creek sits adjacent to the Beaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest and the Anaconda-Pintler Wilderness, which features stunning high-alpine vistas. This time of year, when the aspens are changing colors, your heart will stop. It is the perfect fall backdrop for tying the knot. Not to mention, an autumn ranch wedding wardrobe is fab.”\n—Michelle Rago, Michelle Rago Ltd. | Michelle Rago Destinations\nTwin Farms , Barnard, Vermont\n“Twin Farms in Barnard, Vermont, is a gorgeous 300-acre Relais & Chateaux property with panoramic views and a beautiful pond where you can have an intimate ceremony. There are also large open lawns available for setting up a warmly lit tent with perfect views of the autumn color. It’s the quintessential New England fall experience.”\n—Ron Wendt, Ron Wendt Designs & Weddings\nChâteau de Challain-la-Potherie , Challain-la-Potherie, France\n“At the Château Challain, the grounds are particularly breathtaking in the fall. It is located just two hours outside of Paris and is a town studded with storybook villages and burnished castles. France’s longest river is also in Loire, and guests can enjoy boat rides before the wedding festivities, taking in the remarkable countryside.”\n—Colin Cowie, Colin Cowie Weddings\nThe Lodge & Spa at Brush Creek Ranch , Saratoga, Wyoming\n“We have all heard of dude ranches, but Brush Creek is in its own league. There are numerous outdoor activities for guests like horseback riding and fly-fishing and campfire meals. It’s where the West really comes to life and a true feeling of togetherness emerges.”\n—Yifat Oren, Yifat Oren and Associates", "external_links": ["http://www.feriye.com/", "http://www.vail.com/groups/weddings/weddings.aspx", "http://michelleragoltd.com/", "http://www.brushcreekranch.com/", "http://www.chateauchallain.com/", "http://www.twinfarms.com/", "http://www.theranchatrockcreek.com/", "http://yifatoren.com/", "http://ronwendtdesign.com/", "http://www.vanwyck.net/", "http://www.davidstarkdesign.com/", "http://www.colincowie.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:04:09.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
