We were born in London but in 1949 our family emigrated to the States on the original Queen Mary. The trip was a way of reliving that experience, although it was much shorter on that first journey. It took five days to reach America in 1949 but eight days on our trip. Related articles Springer to host dating show \nAND YOUR WORST? \nA work trip to Ethiopia in the early Eighties.
