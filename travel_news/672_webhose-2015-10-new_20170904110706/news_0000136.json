GreyCastle Security focuses on managing the risks in people, process and technology - as opposed to simply deploying the latest hardware and software solutions. GreyCastle was formed in 2011 by an experienced team of CISOs, ISOs, security specialists and operators who recognized the need for a more comprehensive and systematic approach to cybersecurity.\n“Cyberattacks are at an all-time high and companies need to take measured steps to protect themselves,” said GreyCastle CEO Reg Harnish. “Today, solutions need to go beyond hardware and software – to include a systematic and company-wide process that can identify vulnerabilities and eliminate them before they cause problems. We’ve pioneered a unique approach to helping companies secure their assets, and it’s time to aggressively spread the word about GreyCastle.”\n“It seems that every day we read about new cybersecurity threats – but most, if not all of those stories fail to mention how companies can best protect themselves,” said Crosswind CEO Thomas Graham. “Of all the cybersecurity companies operating today, we believe that GreyCastle’s approach to securing people, process and technology offers a defense that no other company can match, and we’re looking forward to helping GreyCastle spread the word about its innovative approach.”\n on GreyCastle, visit http://www.greycastlesecurity.com , or look for GreyCastle at the following upcoming events: http://www.greycastlesecurity.com/news/events.htm .
