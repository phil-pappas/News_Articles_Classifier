Previously all passengers would receive money in vouchers.\nVirgin’s compensation will apply to:\nup to 50% on a single ticket for delays of between 30 minutes and an hour up to 100% on a single ticket for a delay of between one and two hours up to 100% refund on the cost of a return ticket for delays of more than two hours The company expects around 3.5 million passengers to benefit from the scheme.\nLast month, Virgin Trains East Coast launched two direct services from London Kings Cross to Sunderland and Stirling.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:18:02.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
