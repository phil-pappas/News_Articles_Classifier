One group is then able to get through. \n“Then we have to take over and sweep through the terminal and clear them all from the tracks and the platform.” \nPassenger services have resumed but travellers were warned to expect delays. The spokesman said they were starting to get freight traffic moving as well. \nIt emerged at the weekend that the number of migrants living in makeshift camps outside Calais has now reached 6,000. \nThe numbers have been boosted as the crisis in Calais is part of a wider migrant surge in to Europe from countries in North Africa and the Middle East. \nAt least 15 migrants have died in or near the tunnel since the start of the cross-Channel migrant crisis at the beginning of the summer. \nThe surge in migrants attempting to cross the Channel prompted a string of measures to increase security at the terminal, including extra fencing and the deployment of more border force search and dog teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:17:30.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
