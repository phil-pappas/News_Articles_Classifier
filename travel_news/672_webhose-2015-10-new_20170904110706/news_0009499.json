Chinese travellers are travelling individually and are also showing a preference for more non-traditional destinations,” said Cadogan.\nLast year, the Economist Magazine reported that nearly one in ten international tourists was Chinese, and that China is the largest spender in international tourism globally, she pointed out.\nBarbados has taken steps to encourage more Chinese tourists t visit the island through the signing of a visa abolition agreement for holders of diplomatic and official passports with China in May 2014.\nCadogan added that both countries had exchanged model air services agreements and that work was proceeding on the conclusion of negotiations for the agreements.\nChief tourism development officer in the ministry, Nicole Alleyne, agreed that Barbados stood to benefit from marketing itself in China.\nA Bilateral Tourism Seminar will be held from Oct 13 to Nov 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:13:17.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
