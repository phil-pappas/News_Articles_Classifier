This technology will be integrated into the new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles to be manufactured by Oshkosh Corporation for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. Dana has been a longstanding leader in tire-pressure optimization with decades of experience building tire-pressure management technology for the U.S. military.\nSpicer CTIS technology maximizes vehicle mobility by allowing operators to adjust tire pressure from inside the cab to the optimum footprint on any terrain. This innovative system also allows vehicles to operate effectively with extremely low tire pressure, transporting soldiers to safety in the most strenuous environments.\nAlso, Dana was recently selected to supply Navistar Defense with key components for Medium Tactical Vehicles (MTVs) purchased by the U.S. Army Contracting Command for use by the Afghanistan National Security Force's MTV Fleet. The trucks will feature SPL ® heavy-duty driveshafts, which are designed to efficiently handle heavy loads over long hauls, as well as Spicer ® Compact™ Series driveshafts, which offer best-in-class torque capacity in a durable, lightweight design.
