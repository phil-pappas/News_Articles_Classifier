Being named as the Best Theme Park Halloween Event underscores Six Flags’ ongoing commitment to raise the bar and become the must-experience gold standard amongst Southern California Halloween events. Over the last five years, the 260-acre theme park has upped the scare factor to an entirely new level with a multi-year, multi-million dollar investment in the Fright Fest offering that has significantly improved guests’ experience. Now touting some of the best Halloween experiences in the country, Six Flags Magic Mountain’s 2015 lineup is the biggest and scariest in the park’s history featuring seven mazes and seven scare zones — including one of the biggest scare zones ever — new shows, haunted rides and attractions, more roving “scare-actors,” and due to increasing demand, an additional weekend of operation and longer hours. \n“It is such an honor to be recognized by our guests and fans for the efforts we have made these past five years to make Fright Fest the biggest, the best, and the scariest Halloween event in Southern California,” said park president Bonnie Sherman Weber. “To be chosen by USA TODAY readers as the best in the country is incredible and makes our commitment to continued investment in Fright Fest an even bigger priority.” \nMagic Mountain’s sister park, Six Flags Great Adventure, located in Jackson, New Jersey, was also named one of America’s best scream parks, coming in second place, making Six Flags Fright Fest a coast-to-coast powerhouse. Fright Fest is hosted by all 13 Six Flags theme parks on weekends in October and early November. \nThis season alone, two new scare zones, a new show and new branded attraction featuring Call of Duty®: Black Ops III, have been added to the park’s horror-filled haunting line up. The new Screampunk District has been transformed into the biggest scare zone ever, TERRORtory Twisted, where steam-spewing mechanical beasts relentlessly hunt down their victims. Also featured in TERRORtory Twisted is a diabolical new show, Unleashed, where a once-glorified, turn-of-the-century circus troupe returns to enact a haunted version of the maniacal and twisted performances of circuses past. The second new scare zone features a transformation of the ever-popular DC UNIVERSE into Sinister Circuit, where crazed comic-like characters run amuck under a canopy of mind-bending lights. \nCall of Duty®: Black Ops III descends on the park with a terrifying experience based on the game’s new Zombies mode, “Shadows of Evil.” For the first time in park history, the wooden coaster, Apocalypse, is transformed for Fright Fest, transporting guests to the 1940’s Film Noir-inspired Morg City, including zombie encounters and more. \nReturning for the second year, three popular state-of-the-art mazes incorporate Hollywood-quality make-up, and story lines not meant for the faint-of-heart. Enter the world of Red’s Revenge…over the river and through the woods, to Grandmother’s house you go, but in this fairytale, guests and the wolf are hunted by Red and her demonic minions. Vault 666 is an old abandoned research facility where genetic experiments crossing humans with animals were once conducted and just recently the frightening secrets have been unearthed, exposing terror and mayhem from deep within the unsecured vault. Willoughby’s Garden of Darkness, a dense labyrinth of man-eating plants and evil apparitions, is inhabited by Innocence, the Willoughby’s youngest daughter, who is always looking for a ghostly playmate…so keep loved ones close. \nAlso back is the demented 3D twist, Toyz of Terror 3D, the defunct toy factory haunted by wicked windups, freakish furries and deranged dolls. And if that is not enough to scare the wits out of even the bravest, guests are now forced to experience the madness in 3D terror. Willoughby’s Resurrected is a reincarnation of the Willoughby family’s beloved haunted mansion that includes hair-raising horror down long harrowing hallways and around each nightmarish-turn. \nOne of the largest and most popular mazes in Southern California, The Aftermath, returns in 2015 to strike terror into the brave souls entering a post-apocalyptic city inhabited by nomad warriors who rule with bone-crushing iron fists and the dead stalk the living. Also returning is Chupacabra, where guests come face to face with this elusive blood-thirsty creature as it petrifies the local Dia De Los Muertos (Day of the Dead) Festival. \nIn addition to the two new scare zones, five additional scare zones around the park leave guests nowhere to hide and screaming to get out alive. After entering Fright Fest through the gates of Demon’s Door, face the undead in Zombie Xing. In Nightmares – A Twisted Fantasy, childhood fears and favorite bedtime stories take on a perverse twist, freak out on Exile Hill when unimaginable sinister souls appear without warning, and throughout the Wasteland, barbarian humanoids dare guests to enter the carnage of The Aftermath. \nAdditional spooktacular shows include the hypnotists, who put park guests in compromising scenarios in their hilarious stage show located in Golden Bear Theater, and the very popular VooDoo Nights, where Ghoul Rock has gone pop with a musical spectacular sure to entertain. Be certain to dust off your thriller moves and join in the fun in the Full Throttle Plaza. \nFor the little monsters, a Trick-or-Treat Trail and Halloween Crafts round out the activities during the day. \nA dining experience, Dining with the Dead, combines an all-you-can-eat buffet with spooky fun and monstertainment for the whole family in the Park’s Picnic Pavilion. \nFor three more frightfully fun weekends, Six Flags Magic Mountain leaves no tombstone unturned to deliver what guest’s want most — the ultimate scare factor. \nRemaining Fright Fest Operating Hours and Days: 10:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.: October 16, 17, 23, 24, 30, 31 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.: October 18, 25 and November 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:59:56.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
