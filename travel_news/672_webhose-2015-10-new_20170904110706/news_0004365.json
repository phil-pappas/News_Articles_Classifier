The historic capital sits along the banks of the Seine River, which flows through the French countryside and past picturesque villages like Connelles and Val-de-Reuil. Diamond Resorts International® Le Manoir des Deux Amants is an inviting, stunningly landscaped parkland in the heart of Normandy, where visitors can indulge in French hospitality. To wander the streets of Rouen with its lovely old buildings, markets, and shops is to step back centuries in time - back to when Joan of Arc met her fiery fate here in 1431, or when Monet famously immortalized the Giverny Gardens and the Cathedral of Notre Dame in the 1890s. Explore Jumièges Abbey, the fascinating remains of a Benedictine monastery, which was witness to several centuries of war and history until its descent into picturesque ruins by the time of the French Revolution. And while the area is undeniably rich in culture, it is also very popular for outdoor activities like hiking, bicycling, and other sports. \nDiamond Resorts International ® Le Manoir des Deux Amants offers comfortable, spacious accommodations with sumptuous furnishings and details that belie its affordability. The spacious suites feature a well-appointed kitchen and other amenities that make for a cozy evening in, after a long and exciting day of exploring the surroundings. The resort's leisure complex boasts an outdoor swimming pool, sauna, and game room that keep both grownups and kids equally entertained. \nThe quaint nearby town of Connelles - population 241 - is a peaceful retreat amid the natural beauty of France. Graced with all the antiquated charm expected from a quintessential French village, Connelles is a tapestry of colors - rural houses decorated with lovely flowers in full bloom, surrounded by the inspirational serenity of the French countryside. Needless to say, the famous French cuisine will keep your stomach as blissfully happy as your eyes.
