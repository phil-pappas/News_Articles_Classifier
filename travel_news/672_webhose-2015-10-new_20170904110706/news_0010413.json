The experiment could offer a new money-making model for tribes nationwide seeking economic opportunities beyond casinos.\nSantee Sioux leaders plan to grow their own pot and sell it in a smoking lounge that includes a nightclub, arcade games, bar and food service, and eventually, slot machines and an outdoor music venue.\n\"We want it to be an adult playground,\" tribal President Anthony Reider said. \"There's nowhere else in American that has something like this.\"\nThe project, according to the tribe, could generate up to $2 million a month in profit, and work is already underway on the growing facility. The first marijuana cigarettes are expected to go on sale Dec. 31 at a New Year's Eve party.\nThe legalization of marijuana on the Santee Sioux land came in June, months after the Justice Department outlined a new policy that allows Indian tribes to grow and sell marijuana under the same conditions as some states.\nMany tribes are hesitant to jump into the pot business. But the profit potential has attracted the interest of many other tribes, just as the debut of slot machines and table games almost 27 years ago.\n\"The vast majority of tribes have little to no economic opportunity,\" said Blake Trueblood, business development director at the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development. For those tribes, \"this is something that you might look at and say, 'We've got to do something.'\"\nA marijuana resort open to the public has never been tried in the U.S. Even in states such as Colorado and Washington, where pot is fully legal, consumption in public places is generally forbidden, although pro-pot activists are seeking to loosen those restrictions. Colorado tolerates a handful of private marijuana clubs.\nUnlike the vast reservations in western South Dakota, where poverty is widespread, the little-known Flandreau Santee Sioux Reservation is on 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) of gently rolling land along the Big Sioux River.\nThe Santee Sioux hope to use pot in the same way that many tribes rely on casinos -- to make money for community services and to provide a monthly income to tribal members. The existing enterprises support family homes, a senior living community, a clinic and a community centre offering afterschool programs.\nReider hopes marijuana profits can fund more housing, an addiction treatment centre and an overhaul of the clinic.\nThe prosperity that marijuana could bring to Indian Country comes with huge caveats. The drug remains illegal under federal law, and only Congress can change its status. The administration that moves into the White House in 2017 could overturn the Justice Department's decision that made marijuana cultivation possible on tribal lands.\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-03T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:54:16.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
