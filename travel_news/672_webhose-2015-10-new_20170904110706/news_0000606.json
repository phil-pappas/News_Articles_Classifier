The news that the Seychelles government had moved to recognize members of the island's private sector who have been called pioneers of their tourism industry was seen as a real and positive break from the past when governments remained focus in recognizing politicians. \nIn a direct question by a Mauritian press as to why the break from such a practice of recognizing politicians for their work as head of a Ministry, Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture, said that in Seychelles it was accepted that government are but facilitators and that the private sector were, are, and remain the motor behind the Seychelles tourism industry. \"Members of the private sector are our front-line team. They needed to be recognized, and they turned out to say that they appreciated this move by the government. When she delivered her address at the official launch of the Tourism Pioneer's Park, Kathy Mason of Mason's Travel also said so publicly,\" said Minister St.Ange as he explained that the park dedicated to the tourism private sector was situated right at the entrance of the Seychelles Tourism Academy. \nThe Minister went on to explain that all the past ministers of Tourism of Seychelles are being recognized for the role they played at the head of the ministry at one time or the other. \"They all have their official photographs in the lobby of our ministry, and everyone can see who held the tourism portfolio in Seychelles. Our politicians are recognized already, but the time was right to get our private sector personalities recognized for a change,\" Minister St.Ange said. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
