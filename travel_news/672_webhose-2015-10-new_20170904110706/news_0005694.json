This new electronic warfare suite will counter threats and better protect air crews. The contract is valued at $4 billion.\n“As we look at future threats, enhanced electronic warfare is more essential than ever to improve overall survivability,” said Lt. Col. James Parslow, U.S. Air Force F-15 EPAWSS program manager, Fighter/Bombers Directorate, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. “We look forward to adding this next-generation capability to enhance the air superiority mission of the F-15.”\nThe new threat detection system will be installed on more than 400 F-15Es and F-15Cs, replacing the Tactical Electronic Warfare System also known as TEWS.\n“Warfighters of today and tomorrow need the latest in jamming, targeting, infrared threat detection and enhanced decoy capabilities,” said Mike Gibbons, vice president, Global Strike Boeing F-15 programs. “EPAWSS will ensure the F-15 is relevant and dominant through 2040 and beyond.”\nSource:- Boeing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:20:35.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
