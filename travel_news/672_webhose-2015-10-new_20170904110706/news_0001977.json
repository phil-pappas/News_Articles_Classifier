Related Content 10 best romantic getaways \nThe airline said Monday morning that passengers should try to print their boarding passes before arriving at the airport. \nIntermittent technical issues on Southwest.com, the Southwest mobile app and the airline's phone centers could make doing so difficult. \nThose who get to the airport without boarding passes may have to be checked in manually, causing longer wait times. Southwest warned fliers to arrive \"at least two hours early\" and advised customers to use kiosks to print boarding passes and bag tags. \nThe problems persisted throughout the day Sunday, resulting in 450 delays out of 3,600 scheduled flights. No delays had been reported by 7 am on Monday. \nSouthwest is typically a leader in on-time performance. The airline said no flights were canceled Sunday due to the problems. \nCustomers are encouraged to use swamedia.com for updates. \nTypically airlines that experience technology problems are able to correct it in a matter of an hour or two. That was the case when a glitch at United Airlines grounded 4,900 scheduled flights in July, and again in September when computer problems affected American Airlines flights at some of its busiest hubs, including Chicago O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth and Miami. \n--CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
