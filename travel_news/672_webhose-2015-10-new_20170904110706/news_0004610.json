Since Expedia.ca launched the yearly Vacation Deprivation survey in 2003, Canadians have left 350 million vacation days unused. That equals roughly $53 billion in wages given back to employers. \nPHOTOS: Countries with the most, least vacation time \nThe most popular reasons for not using vacation time were work schedules (32%), saving for obligations like a house or car (29%), and family or personal schedules (24%). \n\"Unsurprisingly, a staggering number of Canadians (53%) continue to consider themselves vacation deprived,” said Christopher Day, senior director of marketing at Expedia Canada, in a statement. \nTo encourage Canadians to travel more, Expedia.ca held a search for the most vacation deprived individuals in the country -- people who haven't travelled for 15 years or more -- and sent them on an all-expenses paid trip to one of three countries where employees take double the vacation time Canadians do -- Spain, Denmark and France. \n\"Year after year, our survey has revealed that Canadians continue to be plagued with vacation deprivation,\" said Day. \"So this year, instead of simply telling Canadians what they are missing out on, Expedia.ca wanted to show them first hand. That’s why we took our Vacation Deprivation Survey to the next level with Vacation Education, seeking out Canada’s most vacation deprived.\" \nTo see these travellers' journeys, visit the Expedia.ca YouTube channel . \nExpedia.ca is celebrating its 15th anniversary in Canada this year. The Vacation Deprivation survey has been conducted each year since the company's second year of operation.
