Farewell sun lounger, hello soft play. The Unmumsy Mum ponders how to re-imagine a holiday post-children. Lots of sand, but no sun loungers: the Unmumsy Mum and her family on the beach in Cornwall Photo: Sarah Turner By Sarah Turner, writer of the Unmumsy Mum blog 12:07PM BST 20 Oct 2015 Comments \nWhenever I hear the word holiday my brain transports me back to the Great Untroubled Sunbathe of 2008. I can almost feel my shoulders relax as I remember lounging semi-reclined on a sunbed in the Dominican Republic , cold drink in hand, glancing up from the pages of an engaging Dan Brown thriller to stare out to sea. \nForget holidays as you knew them: trips with toddlers offer little in the sitting-on-a-sun lounger department \nHolidaying with my then-boyfriend (he’s now my husband), our itinerary revolved around sunbathing, swimming, eating, drinking and sleeping. Our biggest concern was making it down to reception in time to catch the Monster Truck Safari excursion we’d only signed up for so we could say we’d seen some sights. \nWe flew home feeling tanned, rested and eager to frame the selfies we’d taken of our bronzed smiling faces in front of a sunset. I often joke that I would “give anything” for 10 days in Mauritius without the kids, but the truth is that I’d hate it because I would miss them like mad. Unmumsy Mum \nFast forward to 2015 and I’d say the jury is still out on whether “holiday” is the most appropriate term to describe the four days we spent sleeping in a caravan. Not quite on a par with the aforementioned luxury escape, this summer’s adventure saw us head off on a mini-break to Cornwall. Now the proud owners of small people (two boys, ages one and three), this was actually our first getaway as a family of four. It bore no resemblance whatsoever to our all-inclusive relaxation vacations of yesteryear. \nI realised approximately 40 seconds into the journey, when both children started whining, that we were not heading off towards rest and rejuvenation. \nHaving previously believed that holidays were all about winding down and getting away from it all, this took some time to digest. Even on the return journey four days later (cue more whining, placated with snack bribes), I couldn’t help but reflect that it would have been quite nice to have spent time floating in one of those fancy infinity pools abroad, rather than sitting in the baby section of a Fun Pool in Newquay, trying not to notice the plasters and other unidentified debris floating past. \nIt would have been quite nice to have enjoyed a sophisticated meal at a restaurant, while drinking wine, rather than sitting on a beach having an argument with a three-year-old about the sausage and chips he had explicitly chosen from the chip shop but was refusing to eat, while drinking Robinsons Fruit Shoots. \nIt would have been quite nice to have had the chance to potter around some quaint seaside towns at leisure, rather than finding myself crawling on my hands and knees around a soft play warren at somewhere called Dairyland (where we then paid over the odds for a cuddly toy cow because we’d forgotten to pack our son’s special bedtime bear which made us the Worst Parents Ever). \nIn many ways it would be easy to conclude that our trip was disappointing, that it was so far removed from being a holiday that it just wasn’t worth it (what’s the point?) but I feel that would be an unfair assessment. As parents of a baby and pre-schooler, we are gaining an ever-growing understanding of what parenthood truly entails and it would be foolish of us to compare our getaway to the pre-children sunny relaxation marathons. \nUninterrupted sunbathing is simply not our life right now; the life of fun pools and exploding nappies and public tantrums is one we have entered into voluntarily. \nI reckon we need to file the Great Untroubled Sunbathe of 2008 in the Pre-Parent Nostalgia drawer and continue making plans to add to the Family drawer, instead. \nI often joke that I would “give anything” for 10 days in Mauritius without the kids, but the truth is that I’d hate it because I would miss them like mad. In fact, I think I would miss all of it - except for the soft play, which makes me want to claw my own eyes out. \nWill memories of the boys happily building sandcastles in their underpants supersede the memory of lazing about in the Caribbean? Photo: Sarah Turner \nHolidaying with our boys wasn’t a relaxing experience – effectively we packed up our troubles and took them on tour – but it was an experience nonetheless. \nThe kids weren’t always well behaved, we didn’t find time to read any books and, on occasion, it was annoying to have to stop for bi-hourly refreshments to stave off somebody having a meltdown. \nYet I suspect, in years to come, that memories of my boys happily building sandcastles in their underpants will supersede the memory of the sun lounger lazing. Holidaying with our boys wasn’t a relaxing experience – effectively we packed up our troubles and took them on tour Unmumsy Mum \nHolidays are becoming something else. Though if my husband is reading this and wants to organise a two-night sleepover at Nanny’s for the boys so we can escape somewhere hot for 48 hours, that would be just fine. Hint, hint.
