He blamed \"ineffective management\" at Transaero for the company's troubles.\nTransaero shares fell by over 40 per cent in Moscow trading Friday and traded at less than 10 per cent of their value compared to eight months ago.\nThe Russian airline sector as a whole has suffered from lower demand for foreign travel due to the fall in the value of the ruble over the last two years.\nOn Friday, Aeroflot's general director Vitaly Savelyev was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying Transaero could stop all flights Oct. 15, and that between 5,000 and 6,000 of Transaero's roughly 11,500 staff could be offered jobs with Aeroflot.\nSome scheduled Transaero services to destinations such as the western Russian city of Kaliningrad and the Crimean city of Simferopol on Friday and Saturday were listed as cancelled, while others were operating. Transaero had said Thursday it was revising its schedule.\nAeroflot led Russian airlines by transporting 17.28 million passengers on domestic and international routes in the first seven months of the year, compared with 9.36 million for Transaero, according to Russia's Federal Air Transport Agency. The next biggest airline, S7, transported 5.45 million passengers.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:39:34.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
