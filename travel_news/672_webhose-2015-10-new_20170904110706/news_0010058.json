Garfield Weston Foundation, will be announced Nov. 14 at the Beaverbrook Art Gallery in Fredericton. \nAs well, the first five Kingston Prize-winning paintings — by artists Mike Bayne, Joshua Choi, Richard Davis, Marcia Perkins and Andrew Valko — are on display at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre in Kingston, Ont., until Dec. 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:18:35.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
