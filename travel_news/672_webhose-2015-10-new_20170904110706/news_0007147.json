Dannel P. Malloy and other state officials gathered at the airport in Windsor Locks to announce the September 2016 start of the service. Northwest Airlines halted flights between Connecticut and Amsterdam in 2009.\nCatherine Smith, Connecticut's economic development commissioner, said the state will reimburse Aer Lingus $4.5 million in each of the first two years of operation, but could cancel its commitment after the first year if the airline's performance falls below a certain level.\nWith service beginning in 11 months, the airline and the state have time to advertise the air service to improve the chances of success, she said.\n\"The good news is we have a year to do that marketing,\" Smith said.\nThe daily Aer Lingus-operated flight will include one evening departure from Bradley at 6:20 p.m., arriving in Dublin at 5:20 a.m., and one afternoon departure from Dublin at 2:30 p.m. and arriving at Bradley at 4:40 p.m.\nAirline CEO Stephen Kavanagh said the addition of daily service will link Hartford with the airline's Dublin gateway and \"provide convenient connections to a wide range of British and European cities.\"\nMalloy said the trans-Atlantic flights will connect Connecticut to new business and economic development opportunities.\n\"We have a significant corporate base within Connecticut and our surrounding states that have substantial regional and European connectivity needs,\" he said. \"As a centrally located, major airport, Bradley will continue to be an important economic driver for Connecticut.\"\nBradley also offers international flights to Canada and Mexico.\n____\nThis story has been corrected to show the announcement was Wednesday, not Tuesday.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Aer+Lingus+establishes+Dublin+flights+from+Bradley+airport"], "published": "2015-10-22T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:33:55.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
