At the same time, such trends in tyre industry as informatization, automation, intelligentization, greening, and high-end (less noise, low rolling resistance, low thermogenesis, run-on-flat, all-weather and tyre pressure self-control, as well as applications of new nano materials and framework materials) will stimulate the demand for the high-end safe and green tyres with high added value, thus further driving capital inrush into high-end tyre. In the future, the demand for the high-end rubber machinery in line with the development tendencies of tyre industry such as energy saving, environmental friendliness, automation, informatization and high intelligence will show rapid growth.\nMeanwhile, robots are increasingly utilized in tyre production, logistic automation, etc. In 2010, Mesnac Co., Ltd acquired Qingdao Kingerobot Automation Co., Ltd and set foot in the robot field. In 2014, Mesnac's robot and information logistic business revenue surged by 129.7% YoY to RMB193.75 million , a 6.8% share of total revenue. Greatoo Inc. also endeavored to involve in robot business, and in December 2014 the first industrial robot automation line customized by Greatoo for Hangzhou Zhongce Rubber Co., Ltd was officially put into operation. From 2013 to 2015H1, the robot business revenue of Greatoo reported RMB450,000 , RMB6.22 million and RMB25.29 million , respectively.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1.
