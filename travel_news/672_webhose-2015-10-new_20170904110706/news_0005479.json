All other passengers were towed back to the transportation center and evacuated. \nNo injuries were reported. \n\"The minute we got to the ticketing station, a bunch of people from Disney were there to meet us with water, ice and anything we needed,\" Pilichowski said. \nOfficials said a possible mechanical problem caused the stoppage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:06:41.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
