At least 50,414 fines were issued to parents who took their children out of school for an “unauthorised absence” in the academic year 2014-2015, nearly three times as many as in the first year of the ban, when around 18,000 were issued,and up 25 per cent on last year, when just over 40,000 fines were issued. Childhood is short; family relationships play a key role in each child’s development and contribute considerably to the overall education of the child. Craig Langman A regional breakdown of the figures, which were revealed in the week before children across England break up for half-term, show that Lancashire Council imposed the most term-time holiday fines last year, at 3,907. Since September, 2013, under guidance from the Department of Education, children can only be taken out of school during term time in “exceptional circumstances”. If they skip school during term time, parents face a £60 fine doubles if it is not paid within three weeks. Those failing to pay face prosecution – and a fine of a maximum of £2,500 following prosecution, or up to three months in prison. Many families have refused to pay the fines, leading to court proceedings. Just last week, a father who took his daughter to Disney World during term time overturned the court fine imposed against him. Jon Platt successfully argued that his daughter's unauthorised absence, to go to Disney World, did not mean she failed to attend school on a regular basis and had his fine thrown out of court Photo: Solent News Jon Platt, 44, successfully argued that his daughter's unauthorised absence did not mean she failed to attend school on a regular basis and had his fine thrown out of court by magistrates on the Isle of Wight after he argued that the law required parents only to ensure that their children attend school “regularly”. Campaigners have speculated that this could help pave the way for hundreds of other parents to also appeal their fines. But ministers have argued that missing school is detrimental to a child’s education. Over the past year, across 98 councils who responded to the Freedom of Information Act, 86,010 fines were issued in 2014/15 for pupil absence – either through holiday or truancy. This was up from 62,204 the year before and 32,512 in 2012/13. Craig Langman, who founded the campaigning group Parents Want A Say after his young son was prevented by his school from visiting his elderly grandfather during term-time, is concerned that the Government is lumping those pursing enriching term-time holidays with children who are playing truant. Writing in the Telegraph , he argued: “The Government has lost sight of what is in the best interest of children. Rather than applying blanket policies, each request should be assessed individually, to reflect on the differing needs of each family.” And workers in the hospitality industry have complained that the strict law has led to a sharp dip in revenues. One in five West Country tourism businesses have said that the 'Gove effect' has led to a drop of more than 30 per cent in turnover over the past two years – costing the industry £87 million a year. The latest figures were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act for an investigation by the Press Association into truancy fines.
