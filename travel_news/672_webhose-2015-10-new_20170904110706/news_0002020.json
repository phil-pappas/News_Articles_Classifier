The re-imagination reveals a fresh lobby look, complete renovation of all 266 guestrooms, new Club Level and Lounge and full updates of the ballroom and meeting spaces. \nA CLASSIC REIMAGINED: GUESTROOMS Led by Jude Mulhern of Bilkey Llinas Design, based in West Palm Beach, Fl., inspiration was drawn from the Gulf seascape and history of the destination to create a uniquely Sarasota experience at the luxury resort, playing on the hotel's scenography of \"Water, Rings and The Arts.\" The new color palate in the guestrooms evokes flora and fauna from the nearby Selby Botanical Gardens, alongside soft blues and purples reflected in Sarasota sunsets. Each room is appointed with an eclectic mix of contemporary and traditional furniture that speaks to the history of the destination as the winter home of American circus owner John Ringling; his Mediterranean Revival residence and former home, Ca' d'Zan; and the Ringling Museum. \nArtwork displayed in the Sarasota hotel rooms is a selection of images from local artists and students of the prestigious Ringling School of the Arts. The carpet features a non-repeating, abstract motif of a Nautilus shell, a first of its kind in hotel design, thanks to new technology. Guestroom corridors and elevator lobbies now feature an oversized contemporary moiré wall covering reminiscent of sand dunes and sea, offset by soft textured corridor carpet, which is an interpretation of a Sarasota sunset with blue water kisses dancing on a sea green and lavender textured ground. \nA NEW CLUB LEVEL AND LOUNGE EXPERIENCE The Club Level and Lounge experience that is distinctly Ritz-Carlton has been reimagined to reflect the new ambiance at the downtown Sarasota hotel. Continuing with the seashore theme used in the guestrooms, the Club is an inviting space for guests, evoking the feeling of a shore-side picnic under a banyan tree. Locally-captured photographs of seagulls and shore life, alongside colorful artwork and décor reflecting the beautiful Selby Botanical Gardens transforms the Club into an extension of the outdoors in Sarasota. \nA NEW LOOK: BALLROOM AND MEETINGS SPACES Inspiration for re-imagination of the 12,000-square-foot ballroom and five distinct meetings spaces started from a mosaic on the grounds of the Ca' d'Zan. This is particularly reflected in the carpet design: a background of star constellations reflecting in an abstract pattern that feels like the night sky, harkening to days when Sarasota sailors navigated their route home by reading the star patterns. The crystal ballroom chandeliers are interpretations of circus rings, illuminating over the mosaic motifs to become artwork elements in the carpet. The décor in the event venues serves as a linking element between whimsical resort themes and the sailor-inspired design of the Jack Dusty restaurant. \n\"The reimagined property encapsulates the soul of Sarasota, tying in local history, art and culture, which is prevalent in all areas of hotel,\" said General Manager Damien O'Riorden. \"The seashore theme is widespread throughout the hotel from the décor of each guestroom to the property being home to the only seaside restaurant in Sarasota, Jack Dusty.\" \nGuests can experience the re-imagined Ritz-Carlton, Sarasota with rates starting at $419 per night, plus taxes.
