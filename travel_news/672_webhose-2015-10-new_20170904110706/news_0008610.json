People are visiting Southampton for business, cruises or work to pay taxes to a bunch of idiots, for Gods sake get a grip on contractors taking the ****!

Not one worker to be seen whilst hundreds, if not thousands, of people are delayed by half an hour or more and hundreds of thousands of pounds drains out of the economy. Which clown has direct responsibility for ensuring that emergency works are treated as such and completed in the minimum possible time?

Talking of road works with no one there the M3 is a bloody joke, 10 miles of reduced lanes and speed restrictions from Basingstoke to Farnborough and not a soul to be seen ever!
