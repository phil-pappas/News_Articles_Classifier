Peter Barnett made hundreds of journeys from his home in Oxford to London's Marylebone station without buying tickets.\nInstead he pretended to have only travelled from Wembley, north west London, paying just for the short trips in the capital.\nThe 44-year-old was caught when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone, claiming to have travelled from Wembley instead of Haddenham & Thame Parkway in Oxford.\nCity of London Magistrates' Court heard that Barnett had received a conditional caution in 2010 for a similar offence.\nBut the father-of-three dodged a trip to jail today when a judge gave him a prison sentence of 16 weeks, suspended for 12 months.\nDeputy District Judge Olalekan Omotosho told him his serial fare-skipping was a \"serious offence\", saying: \"There is a need not just to punish you for the offences but also deter others from committing offences.\"\nLast updated Wed 30 Sep 2015 Travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:49:26.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
