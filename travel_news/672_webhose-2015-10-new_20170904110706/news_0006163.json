But don’t be fooled. This project isn’t your typical Halloween thrill. Far from it. The nonprofit organization has taken over a giant warehouse at 1505 King St., which some may remember as the set of Lifetime’s “Army Wives” a few years ago. Since the show stopped filming, the space has mostly been vacant, adding to the collection of drab warehouses in that industrial part of town. That is until Enough Pie’s Executive Director Cathryn Zommer got ahold of it recently. Through connections with its owners, she concocted a plan to install a free art and music experience over the course of Halloween weekend that will expose the community not just to one of the area’s many warehouses, but also to the rare experience of observing light as an artistic expression in a sea of immense darkness. Both are related to Enough Pie’s overall mission, which is to facilitate community on the upper peninsula through creative projects. “Warehouses are central to the upper peninsula,” Zommer explained. “We wanted to literally open the doors to a warehouse, invite people in, and say, look. And then beyond just look, experience the space in this new way.” On Tuesday, the community is invited to a special opening party, called “Igniting Sound and Light,” which will help replenish the organization’s funds that were used to create the free art installation for next weekend. Held at the warehouse, the festivities will involve a sneak peek of the full experience, plus a dance floor with the Preservation Soul Society of Charleston spinning records and Local 616 manning the pop-up bar, as well as an outdoor celebration with food trucks and roller derby girls and several other activities. But first, here’s an idea of what this installation is all about. Into the darkness Enough Pie will bring in Craig Colorusso, an Arkansas-based artist, to mount his works in and around the warehouse for the “Sound and Light” experience. Since the late 1990s, Colorusso has created four main projects that toy with the intersection of sound, light and space. The Charleston installation is the first time all four of his pieces will be displayed at once. “I see all of these (pieces) as separate entities, but at the same time, I see a connection between all of them, so I’m really excited to present all of them together,” he said. When guests arrive at the warehouse for the exhibit, they’ll walk up to a welcome area underneath a giant oak tree on the far east side of the building. There, they’ll find picnic tables strewn with merchandise that hint at what Enough Pie is all about: bags of recycled glass from Fisher Recycling, an upper peninsula business, intended for people to create their own glass mosaics; and a coloring book created by Colorusso and the organization’s 18-year-old intern, Paul Smith, called “Sound and Light: how the world could be, a contemplative coloring book.” Moving forward, guests will pass through a chain-link fence with swirls of barbed wire on top, adding a dash of authentic eeriness to the experience. In the paved outdoor area, there will be a collection of 20 structures that look like side tables with solar panels on top. Those are Colorusso’s “Sun Boxes.” When hit with rays, small speakers inside are activated to play a different guitar note in each box, which are looped at different lengths, creating a continuously evolving symphony of meditative sounds. “They’ll be there sort of inviting people in, kind of saying, ‘Hey, buckle up,’” Colorusso said. Then, through a small door on the edge of the building, up a few steps, and through another door, the indoor exhibit begins in what seems like it must be the largest part of the warehouse. The giant room will be pitch-black except for the blue light glowing from “MB 89,” a series of three, 10-foot-tall cylinders. Using the same sort of engineering as a wrap-around shower curtain, they’re essentially a circular rod draped with white cloth, illuminated from behind with blue lights. Inside one of the cylinders, Colorusso will actually play the bass clarinet through pedals that distort its sound. Typically, he plays four hours during each installation. The artist, who played guitar in punk-rock and hard-core bands for most of the ’90s, said showcasing “MB 89” in public meant he could leave his career as a traveling musician without giving up his love of playing live music. “It’s not a performance from start to finish ... it’s a continuous piece of music that sort of reflects, basically, just being able to articulate musical ideas for the rest of my life,” he said. “I wanted to obscure the fact that I was there, but not necessarily keep it a secret ... I wanted people to walk into a room and feel like they’re in a different place.” That’s essentially the whole theme of “Sound and Light,” and of Colorusso’s works in general. “In all of my pieces, I think I create environments for people to enter and exit at will. I just wanted to ... carve out a section of the world that was different, and invite people to come into it for a little while,” he said. After experiencing “MB 89,” the audience can follow a path of reflective tape to yet another door to an even larger room that, in the dark, feels like it could go on forever. That’s where they’ll find “Cubemusic,” six 4-by-4-foot aluminum cubes with different geometric shapes carved into each side. Internally, they have a light source that dims and brightens over time, which constantly changes the shadows of the room, and a speaker programmed with a four-note guitar chord. “It basically transforms the room into this sort of ... throbbing kind of glow,” Colorusso said. “The piece really becomes the room that it’s in because every room is different and the shadows it casts are just amazing.” In a smaller room off to the side, Colorusso’s fourth and latest piece, “Moon Phases,” will be on display. It’s a sculpture that plays pre-recorded music in a pattern that mimics the waxing and waning of the moon. Piece of the pie Taken together, the pieces are meant to immerse the audience in a space where they can contemplate the present moment, Colorusso said. “I literally wanted to make stuff that people could feel like they’re a part of,” he added. “There’s something about the stage where there’s a barrier between audience and performer, and I wanted to make something without that. Where somebody could really walk in and be a part of it.” Zommer said that’s why she wanted to partner with Colorusso on a large-scale project like “Sound and Light.” She met the artist at Art Fields, an art festival in Lake City, where he was displaying “Cubemusic.” “When I was watching the audience move through (“Cubemusic”) and play and move their hands toward the light, there was an engagement with the work that I was immediately ... so moved,” Zommer said. After discussing Colorusso’s other works, she said the vision of a “glowing warehouse” popped into her head for Enough Pie’s next project. It was such an exciting idea, she said she couldn’t help but bring it up a few weeks later when she was having a beer with a friend, Michael Woody, the founder of Raven Cliff Company, a real estate investment and development firm based in Charleston. “He gave me this look with a little glitter in his eye like, ‘You know I have a warehouse, right?’” Enough Pie then partnered on the project with BoomTown, the local technology business that’s taking over the warehouse in the coming months to transform it into the company’s headquarters. Zommer said the staff has been “so supportive” of the project. “They want to come to this community and really figure out ways to be a part of this neighborhood,” she added. “Sound and Light” is the latest in a string of Enough Pie’s initiatives centered around life and community on the upper peninsula. Since Zommer became executive director earlier this year, its projects have included block parties and play dates on the East Side; a community-wide public mural installation this summer on Huger Street involving dozens of local artists; a march for social justice with Black Lives Matter; and even a mayoral forum on race equity. “It’s hard to put Enough Pie in a box, we do so many different things,” Zommer said. “This past autumn, we’ve gone from hosting the mayoral forum on equity to the next day, doing a community pizza party, which actually walked the walk of what we were talking about the night before about how do we come together ... black, white, rich, poor, young, old, gay, straight. How do we really live the unity that we’re talking about? We’re determined to continue to try to find ways.” The “Sound and Light” warehouse project seemed like one of those ways, she said, because it gives everybody a place to be inspired. “Creativity wakes us up,” she said. “And once you’re awake, it’s hard to go back. You start to become aware, and then lots of stuff starts to happen.” Reach Abigail Darlington at 937-5906 and follow her on Twitter @A_Big_Gail .
