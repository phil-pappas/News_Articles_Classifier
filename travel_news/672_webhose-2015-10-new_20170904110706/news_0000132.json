The economy is largely dominated by the service sector and the city is an important transport, retail, events and conference hub. The announcement of this new route further strengthens Qatar Airways’ commitment to the UK regions, with Birmingham being the centre for the largest concentration of businesses outside of London, boasting 34,285 companies including over 700 international firms. The city attracts nearly 34 million people a year for both business and pleasure and is ideally situated at the centre of the UK’s rail and motorway network.\nQatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker said: “We are delighted to announce Birmingham as Qatar Airways’ fourth destination in the United Kingdom from March 2016. This additional route strengthens Qatar Airways’ commitment to the regions across the UK and will create new commercial and leisure links between the city of Birmingham and the 152 destinations served by the airline. We look forward to welcoming new passengers on board our award-winning product, and to connecting Birmingham to the rest of our rapidly expanding network.”\nBirmingham Airport Chief Executive Officer, Paul Kehoe said: “This is fantastic news for both Birmingham Airport and the region, and is our tenth new airline to announce or launch this year.\nNot only will our passengers have the choice of flying with the award winning carrier to Doha’s state-of-the-art hub Hamad International Airport, they will have a choice of 152 destinations served by the airline, including South East Asia, China and Australasia.”\nThe route will be operated by a Boeing 787 Dreamliner which has a two-cabin configuration, comprising of 22 seats in Business Class and 232 Economy Class seats. All seats include individual television screens, with Economy Class customers benefitting from a screen 10.6-inches wide, offering the latest inflight entertainment comprised of up to 2,000 options while experiencing the airline’s award-winning service. Every seat is an aisle seat in Business Class where passengers can catch up on sleep in a fully-flat bed or make productive use of their time utilising the large work surface area. Passengers can also stay connected while travelling with the option of Wi-Fi which is available throughout the aircraft.\nThanks to HIA’s modern design, passengers from Birmingham can now take advantage of\nconvenient, quick and seamless onward connections to 152 key business and leisure destinations across Qatar Airways’ ever-expanding global network, including those in Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Africa, with the West Midlands in the UK now easily accessible from cities such as Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangkok and Hong Kong.\nConnections between countries such as Pakistan and Australia to Birmingham have never been easier thanks to Qatar Airways. In Pakistan the airline serves seven destinations including Karachi, Multan, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Peshawar, Lahore and Islamabad. The airline has also recently announced two new destinations in Australia, Sydney and Adelaide, commencing in March and May 2016 respectively, to complement its existing Perth and Melbourne services.\nQatar Airways’ home, Hamad International Airport, houses one of the world’s largest and most luxurious Business Class lounges – the Al Mourjan Business Lounge – and also has over 40,000 square metres of retail space and restaurants that includes a selection of more than 70 retail and 30 food and beverage outlets.\nThe national airline of the State of Qatar was named the world’s best carrier at the 2015 Skytrax Awards earlier in June, marking the third time the airline has won this coveted accolade. The airline also won Best Business Class Airline Seat and Best Airline in the Middle East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:56:37.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
