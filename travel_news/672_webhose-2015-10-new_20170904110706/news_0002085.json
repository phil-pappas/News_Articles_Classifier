Spencer Green COMMENTARY\nIt was not so long ago that the Red Sox and Cubs were kindred spirits in a way that no two franchises would ever willfully choose to be.\nSo many crucial ballgames were lost through the decades—often in spectacularly self-destructive fashion—that the franchises themselves were perceived as a tandem of lost causes, their fans treated as lost souls.\nBad luck and bad decisions hovered and haunted the organizations like ghosts from one generation to the next. No, the Red Sox were never cursed. But there was enough circumstantial evidence suggesting as much that the perception became a recurring plot.\nThe Red Sox spoiled that narrative and left the Cubs all by their lonesome by winning three championships in 10 years. The first of those titles, as I suspect you recall rather vividly, was won in 2004, the 86-year championship drought ending with the most spectacular plot-twist possible.\nThe Red Sox lost the first three games of the American League Championship Series against the Yankees, their longtime tormentor, then won four straight by following a script the most optimist straggler among Red Sox fans might have dreamed, but would never have dared suggest out loud. When I watch the replays, even now, when we know we’re witnessing the truth, I half-expect Dave Roberts to be called out, you know?\nFour times since 1975 has a major professional North American sports team rallied from a 3-0 hole to win a best-of-seven series. Three times it has occurred in hockey: The 1975 Islanders, 2010 Flyers (against, ahem, the Bruins), and 2014 Kings have achieved such a feat.\nThe other time—the one other time—it happened was, of course, those ’04 Red Sox.\nThe Cubs, down 3-0 to the Mets in the ongoing National League Championship Series, have not won a championship since 1908. Their drought has lasted longer than the Red Sox’ did, and with less suspense along the way.\nBefore their three recent championships, the Red Sox came so close to winning so many previous times that they could practically taste the champagne. The Red Sox have had seven-game World Series showdowns four times (1946, ’67, ’75 and ’86) since the Cubs’ last Fall Classic appearance in 1945.\nThe Cubs have endured their share of agony and anguish. But the Red Sox suffered many more unfulfilled close calls, many more what-ifs.\nThe Cubs are stuck alone now, still awaiting their catharsis. Even their brothers in broad shoulders, the less-celebrated White Sox, won a title in 2005, ending their own 88-year drought.\nSure, the film Back To The Future Part II forecast 26 years ago that their time would come in 2015. But that future has become the present, and right now it feels like the same old weary story is playing out for the Cubs.\nThey are still waiting for their redemptive moment. And so it’s natural for the Cubs, stuck in a moment in which their next game could be their season’s last, to turn toward the Red Sox for a morsel of inspiration.\n“It happened to one New York team before,” said Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo after the Mets’ 5-2 win Tuesday night. “Let’s do it to the other one.”\nAs unlikely as such a rally is, there are some intriguing parallels and compelling connections between what the Red Sox accomplished 11 years ago and what the Cubs are trying desperately to achieve now.\nIn ’04, the Red Sox had a first-year manager in Terry Francona who had beaten out, among others, Joe Maddon for the gig. Maddon is now in his first year with the Cubs. The ’04 Red Sox and ’15 Cubs both beat teams with John Lackey on the roster in the previous round. (Hat tip: @timbhealey .) There’s the New York-based opponent element, of course.\nAnd there’s Theo Epstein.\nShould the Cubs win a World Series on his watch, he’s a lock for Cooperstown. Should they somehow rally to win this series, I mean, someone in New York will howl for him to be tried as a witch or something.\nCan you imagine if he oversaw the reversing of two presumed “curses”—and both franchises’ histories of misfortune were overcome in such dramatic and improbable fashion?\nHey, they’re imagining it.\n“It’s been done before,” said Epstein Tuesday night. “Rumor has it.”\nRealistically, the Cubs have at best a glimmer of hope—and it’s an especially faint glimmer at that. Even if they beat talented rookie Steven Matz on Wednesday, the Cubs will have to deal with fireballers Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard and Jacob DeGrom in Games 5, 6 and 7. That trio has allowed 12 earned runs in 45.2 playoff innings while striking out 63.\nIn 2004, the Red Sox came back against a Yankees pitching staff that lacked anything resembling an ace—even Mike Mussina was mediocre, with a 4.59 ERA that year. An angry and aging Kevin Brown won’t be starting Game 7 for the Mets, you know?\nOf course, with the Cubs looking back 11 years in hopes of finding hope for their own near future, it is fun to contemplate how they might go about duplicating the Red Sox’ miracle.\nWho on the Cubs would pass around nips of Jack Daniel’s, as Johnny Damon did. (Maddon is more likely to pass around a bottle of fancy wine he ordered from Hipster Manager’s Monthly .)\nWho drives in the winning run in two ballgames within 24 hours, as David Ortiz did in Games 4 and 5. My money would be on Jorge Soler. Kid can rake.\nWho on the Cubs could offer a proper sequel to Kevin Millar’s legendary “Don’t let us win tonight” speech before Game 5. I actually threw this one out there on Twitter.\nThe consensus seems to be David Ross. Good choice. I’d suggest Manny Ramirez, an awesome Cubs coach of some hazy definition, but I suspect he might not get the details right:\n“Man, let me tell you, we were down nine games to zero to the Yankees or Angels or Orioles, but then Derek Lowe, he was a knuckleballer, won nine games in a row to tie the series and, man, Mark Bellhorn never spoke all season and Dave Roberts stole home and Jeter had to go play golf and it was magical, man. I’ll never forget October 2006.”\nIt would be cool if the Cubs make this a series. But the Mets pitching is so exceptional that it feels like a sweep-in-the-making right now. But the Cubs have the right idea, looking to those ’04 Red Sox for a sign that all hope is not lost. A comeback? Sure, they’re considering the thought. It’s all they’ve got.\nUnless the Mets let ‘em win tonight. Because then it’s Jon Lester in Game 5 and Jake Arrieta in Game 6 and anything can happen in Game 7.
