As well, Regina Mayor Michael Fougere is set to make a cameo appearance as a hockey player in a \"faceoff against our concertmaster Simon McDonald,\" said Derksen.\nThe hall of fame is currently staging an exhibit on minor hockey in Saskatchewan.\n———\nOnline: http://reginasymphony.com/concerts/upcoming\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:20:24.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
