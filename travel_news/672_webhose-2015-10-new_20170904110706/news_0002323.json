Reynolds Retreat is a hidden gem at the heart of Kent NESTLED in the heart of the Kent countryside, the Reynolds Retreat is a hidden gem just waiting to be explored. PUBLISHED: 18:47, Wed, Sep 30, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:15, Wed, Sep 30, 2015 Reynolds Retreat The glistening pool at the Reynolds Retreat \nAfter a year of wedding organising, my fiancé and I decided to take in a little rest and relaxation, so I booked us for a day at their luxury spa. \nReynolds certainly isn't called a retreat for fun, located in a leafy village near Sevenoaks, the spa is surrounded by undulating countryside, visible from its floor to ceiling windows throughout. \nThe spa offers views across Kent which are second to none. \nWe were welcomed by a friendly face and booked in for our treatments. Ever conscious of my expanding waistline, I opted for the Pepper and Grapefruit Slim Effect wrap while my other half went for an aromatherapy body massage. \nIt didn't take long for the calming essential oils to take effect. \nCombined with a firming body treatment, this was a fat-fighting detox which left me feeling revitalised. Reynolds The Reynolds Retreat boasted fantastic facilities \nHaving built up an appetite, we made our way to the Waterleaf Restaurant and Spa, where the menu offered a range of healthy courses packed with super foods. \nWe opted for Salmon Tartar and Beetroot and Fried Duck Egg and Black Pudding for starters and Mackerel, Beetroot and Salad Kale and Quinoa, Sprouting Broccoli and Cashews. \nThe chef's attention to detail made the whole experience refreshing and the fresh ingredients collected from the Retreat's cottage garden added a sense of charm and uniqueness. \nIn the afternoon we explored the spa's facilities. \nFor the fitness types a fully equipped gym and spin room is on offer. \nHowever being more on the easy going side, we headed straight for the spa with its 16m deck level pool and hydrotherapy pool. Reynolds The treatment rooms on offer at the Reynolds Retreat Reynolds Retreat The bar where afternoon tea was served in luxury \nThe spa was tiled from floor to ceiling with Italian marble and boasted a steam bath, Finnish sauna, monsoon showers, deep relax room and ice fountain. \nYou could even wile away the hours with the hydrotherapy foot spas. \nWe finished off our day with a wonderful afternoon tea served up to a near Michelin star level and left feeling as as though we had been away for days. \nIf you have a weekend free and are in need of a littel r&r for even just a couple of hours, the Reynolds Retreat really is the perfect option. \nFULL DETAILS \nPrices for a spa day pass at The Reynolds Retreat start from £45 per person. \nThe Pepper and Grapefruit Slim Effect Wrap, costs £60 and the Full Body Aromatherapy Massage also costs £60.
