Seems that way from the results of this year's museum \"Oscars.\"\nOK, so the top prize in the prestigious Leading Culture Destinations 2015 awards, announced Friday in London, goes to a classic -- New York's Museum of Modern Art.\nPlenty of other usual suspects also made the cut including the Centre Pompidou in Paris and London's Tate Modern.\nBut other giants of the museum world were elbowed out in favor of new arrivals like the spectacular Oita Prefectural Art Museum in Japan, and architecture supremo Frank Gehry's Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.\nWho got left out?\nRead More Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, won Best Emerging Culture Destination in the Middle East. That meant no silverware for France's Louvre. It might be the world's most visited art museum, but it didn't even get a look-in.\nGlobal heavyweights including Florence's Galleria degli Uffizi and Madrid's Reina Sofia are similarly out in the cold.\nThe selections reflect the shift away from the art world's big boys in New York, Paris and London.\nAfter all, 2013's most attended art exhibitions were in Taipei and Rio de Janeiro, not Europe or North America.\nThe 2015 list gives shout-outs to Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art in Qatar, the Gran Museo del Mundo Maya de Merida in Mexico, and other unexpected destinations that are beginning to present serious competition on the global stage.\nEating, drinking and shopping\nLa Colombe d'Or's private art collection includes works by Matisse and Cesar. In addition, the cultural institutions leading the way this year aren't just about art appreciation. They're also places to eat, drink, work, shop, socialize and even sleep.\nAs Andy Warhol said: \"All department stores will become museums, and all museums will become department stores.\"\nSo alongside exhibitions and programming, museums are also judged on architecture and spatial design, digital experience, shopping, and eating and drinking.\nThere's even a category for best art experience in a hotel, with this year's winner being France's La Colombe d'Or, a favorite of stars including Francis Ford Coppola and Drew Barrymore.\nThe full list of winners and nominees are below:\nBest exhibitions & programming\nTate Modern, London (UK) -- Winner\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York (U.S.)\nVictoria & Albert Museum, London (UK)\nNew Museum, New York (U.S.)\nSerpentine Gallery, London (UK)\nBest architecture & spatial design\nFondation Louis Vuitton, Paris (France) -- Winner\nGuggenheim Bilbao, Bilbao (Spain)\nState Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg (Russia)\nMuseum of Islamic Art, Doha (Qatar)\nSolomon R.
