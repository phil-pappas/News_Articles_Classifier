Taking inspiration from the game, Pyramid Breweries recently teamed up with the Portland Trail Blazers to create its newest, limited-edition beer - Reigning 3s. This unfiltered White Pale Ale is Pyramid's take on its own 3-pointer - using a combination of Cascade, Apollo and Lemon Drop hops. With 5.5% ABV, this beer rates 30 on the IBU scale. Due to limited availability fans will have to travel to \"Rip City\" to get a shot of this brew. \"Lemon Drop hops are in high demand right now,\" said Ryan Pappe , head brewer, Pyramid Breweries. \"We used it along with Cascade and Apollo, then added real lemon peel to create a bold and citrusy flavor that we think matches the team and the city of Portland .\"\"Guests at Moda Center and Rose Quarter have come to enjoy the best craft beers in the Pacific Northwest, and we're proud to again offer a very special brew in Reigning 3s,\" said Adam Cook , Vice President and General Manager of the Rose Quarter and Moda Center, home court of the Trail Blazers. \"Pyramid Breweries has been an excellent partner of the Rose Quarter, and we're thrilled to continue that support for our fans and our team by showcasing one of their best craft beers at all of our world-class events.\"Pyramid also will capture the excitement of the 3-ball on the court by making a $10 donation to the Oregon Food Bank for every 3-point shot the Trail Blazers make during the 2015- 2016 season. \"Being able to make a great beer, while giving back is an amazing feeling - we're excited for fans to enjoy it all season long,\" Pappe added. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:57:54.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
