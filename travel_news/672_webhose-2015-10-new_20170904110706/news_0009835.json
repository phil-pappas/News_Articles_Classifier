Kicking off as the jet set and glitterati descend for the 2015 Formula 1TM Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix taking place 26-29 November, the iconic five-star hotel will be the place to see and be seen throughout the upcoming season.\nWhere fast cars meet fashion, the high-octane Formula 1TM weekend is as much about what’s happening off the circuit as on and as the world’s only hotel situated in the middle of a Formula 1TM track, Yas Viceroy is perfectly positioned to soak up the glamour and style. Expect poolside parties and international club nights for stylish celebrations that go beyond the racing.\nParty-goers can warm up with the Access All Areas party at Skylite Lounge on Friday 20th November. With 360 degree panoramic views across Yas Island, the spectacular rooftop club will see beautiful people dance the night away as anticipation builds for the week ahead.\nOnce the chequered flag goes down, the party crowd can look forward to three days of sheer exuberance as the hotel enjoys an unrivalled social scene. Bringing the glamour of the French Riviera to the Middle East, Sunset Monaco will be taking over Palm Gardens for the very first time, transforming it into a hangout for the sophisticated set. Framed by views of the racing track and with world-renowned DJs on the decks until 4am, guests can dance under the stars all night long. For reservation enquiries, please contact booking@sunsetmonaco.com\nWith clubs in London, Dubai and Shanghai, celebrity haunt Cirque le Soir will be joining forces with Rich List to host its one-of-a-kind-club experience at Rush. Performers from around the globe will entertain and keep the party going until the early hours, creating unforgettable memories with spectacular performances. For reservation enquiries, please contact richard@cirquelesoirdubai.com\nThe hotel’s rooftop bar will also be in on the action, allowing guests to enjoy post-race mingling whilst overlooking the stunning pool and soaking in views of Yas Marina. With a DJ spinning house tunes until 3am, the stylish lounge bar will provide a fitting setting for celebrations. Entrance is free.\nWith A-list parties, glitz and glamour, this is just the start of a season of Viceroy Moments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:28:18.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
