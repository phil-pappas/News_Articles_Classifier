In certain cities and small towns, however, there’s really nothing to fear. Both in the U.S. and abroad, there are five destinations that have truly perfected All Hallows’ Eve by offering amazing activities that are well worth the trip outside your door and into the dark of night. Here are the most thrilling things to do when you get there:\nWatch The Rocky Horror Picture Show at The Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles\nIt’s the 40th anniversary of The Rocky Horror Picture Show , and what better place to watch the 1975 musical film than Hollywood’s most culturally significant cemetery? Costumes are required for entry, and there’s a dance party before and after the screening. Doing “The Time Warp” near the resting place of Jayne Mansfield and Johnny Ramone? Yes, please.\nSleepover in the Paris Catacombs\nTalk about escaping the Halloween night crowds: On October 31, Airbnb is offering the chance to spend the night in what is typically referred to as the “world’s largest grave.” Located almost 70 feet below the streets of Paris, the labyrinthine catacombs are lined with the skulls and bones of about 6 million Parisians from the 18th and 19th centuries. The catch (besides sleeping in a legit grave)? You have to enter into Airbnb’s online contest to win the experience. The prize includes a bed and dining for two, as well as a private concert before tucking in among the decay.\nInstagram the pumpkins at The Great Jack O’Lantern Blaze in Hudson Valley, New York\nIt’s like something out of The Nightmare Before Christmas : more than 7,000 pumpkins, intricately carved and lit up for a beautiful walk-through display. There are “flying pumpkin ghosts” in the sky, a “Pumpkin Planetarium,” and a Sleepy Hollow—themed haunted house. Get your camera phone ready.\nDance at the Banks of the Foyle Halloween Carnival in Derry, Ireland\nLocated in Northern Ireland, the Derry Halloween carnival is one of the largest in Europe with extravagant costumes, loads of dancing in the streets, elaborate performances, and a huge fireworks finale. Traveling to Ireland on the 31st would be the ultimate celebration, as scholars have pointed to this country as the birthplace of Halloween and traces its origins back to old Celtic harvest festivals.\nWander the new hedge maze at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado\nThe hotel that inspired the classic 1980 horror film The Shining has a brand-new attraction: a hedge maze like the one that a mad Jack Nicholson ran through with an axe. Though the maze was planted in June and is only 3 feet tall at the moment, visitors and fans of the film can still wander through and get their film-inspired Halloween fix. If the new maze isn’t enough, the hotel will also host its annual “The Shining Ball,” on October 24, and a masquerade party on the 31st. At the soiree, just make sure not to engage any identically dressed twins in conversation.", "external_links": ["http://cinespia.org/event/the-rocky-horror-picture-show/", "https://www.airbnb.co.uk/night-at/paris-catacombs", "http://www.derrystrabane.com/Subsites/halloween/Derry~Londonderry-Strabane-Events/Derry~Londonderry-Events/North-West-Carnival-Initiative-presents,-Rise-of-t", "http://www.hudsonvalley.org/events/blaze", "http://www.stanleyhotel.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:11:11.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
