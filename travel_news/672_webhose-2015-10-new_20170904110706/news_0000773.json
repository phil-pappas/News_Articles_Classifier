You can view the scale at the link below.\nAccording to the company, with airports having strict weight restrictions for flights and carry on baggage, it is important to know how much luggage weighs before you go. This will help avoid delays or issues at the airport and ease the worry from your mind. This is especially true when it comes to travelling for holiday or overseas. There are many other important things to consider when traveling besides luggage weight. The JetSetGo digital luggage scale takes the guesswork out of preparing to travel.\n\"We are very excited to get this product to market to help travellers get their luggage on the planes with as little hassle as possible. We are confident that this is the best digital luggage scale on the market today, and we feel that consumers will strongly agree with us,\" stated Mr. Richard Cale, company spokesperson.\nSome benefits of the JetSetGo! luggage scales are listed below.\n• The scale works straight out of the box.\n• The scale has a simple, instant display, one touch digital luggage scale with a strap suitable for all types of bags, suitcases, hand luggage, and back packs.\n• The electronic luggage scales can lift bags up to 50kg, even though they only weigh 150g.\n• The luggage scales weigh in four different units - grams, kgs, ounces, or lbs.\n• The crystal clear digital display is visible at all times.\n• The auto off button preserves battery life. After 60 seconds of no use, it turns itself off so there's no battery wastage.\n• There is a 12-month warranty on the luggage scale, which means you can use them with peace of mind.\n• The scale is strong and reliable because it comes with a free battery, a sturdy black nylon strap, and durable metal clip.\n• The scale saves you money because you do not have to pay extra fees at the airport.\n• Ergonomically designed to be easy to use and comfortable in your hand.\n• Weigh up to anything weighing 50kg, including parcels.\nTo purchase the product go to this website: http://www.amztk.com/luggagescales\nMore About JetSetGo!\nFounded in 2015, JetSetGo!has helped many travellers travel with peace of mind and ease through the use of their products, including the top selling digital luggage scale.
