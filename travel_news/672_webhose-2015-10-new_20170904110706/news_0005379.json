Its main objective was to raise funds for the hospital’s Cardiac Rehabilitation Unit in order to improve patients’ cardiovascular health. That event featured a concert by La Libertad Symphonic Orchestra, volleyball games, an exhibit and demonstration by Fung, and yoga sessions and Tai Chi classes, among other activities; doctors were also on hand to test the vital signs, body composition and physical fitness of participants. The event raised $3,300, well above organizers’ goal of $2,000.\nMan Yu’s painting “La Espera.”\n(Courtesy of Man Yu Fung)\nThe second event will take place tonight at 7 p.m. at the National Gallery, housed within the Children’s Museum in downtown San José.
