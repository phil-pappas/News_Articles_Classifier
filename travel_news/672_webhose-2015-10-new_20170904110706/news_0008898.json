Picture: AP/Michel Euler Source: AP\nPierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty and Thibaud Simphal could face up to two years in prison and up to 300,000 euros in fines if they are found guilty, the New York Times reports .\nTheir trial has been stood over until mid-February to give their legal team time to examine computer evidence that was seized during raids at the company’s Paris headquarters.\nThe French government last year passed legislation making ridesharing illegal for drivers who do not have a professional license to pick up paying customers.\nMeanwhile, two cab drivers have been charged over Monday’s targeted attacks against Uber drivers in Brisbane.\nOne of the victims was allegedly told “F*** Uber, f*** you, you’re taking away our business” before he was assaulted, the Brisbane Magistrates Court heard this morning.\nThe taxi drivers, aged 26 and 29 from Calamvale, were allegedly part of a group who assaulted two Uber operators at Fortitude Valley and Kangaroo Point, along with a motorist they mistook as a driver with the ridesharing app.\nThe duo will appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on October 9, charged with a string of offences including assault occasioning bodily harm, stealing and unlawful entry of a vehicle.\nUber has enraged taxi drivers around the world, including in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where taxis blocked a main thoroughfare during a protest yesterday.
