ACTE’s annual Global Travel Conference (Europe) and CAPA’s World Aviation Summit will be held under one roof, in Amsterdam, on 26-28 October 2016. According to Greeley Koch, ACTE’s executive director, combining these events brings together two international groups with parallel interests, while shrinking the calendar for buyers and suppliers. . \n“This is an opportunity to provide our members with unparalleled access to the strategic intelligence, research, and data of CAPA, complete with a comprehensive educational programme the global travel community has come to expect from ACTE,” said Koch. “It’s all about providing membership value. In one move, ACTE and CAPA are maximizing membership exposure to industry insight, while shrinking the annual calendar. It’s another way we are working to bring buyers and suppliers together on a global scale.” “CAPA and ACTE have been working together on various programmes throughout the world,” said Peter Harbison, Executive Chairman of CAPA.”Both groups share common objectives and a common vision. ACTE’s reputation for innovation and senior level educational programmes is a perfect match for CAPA’s services, which span the interests of airline CEOs and business travel managers. Combining these two annual events provides more options for clients and members, while enhancing opportunities for buyers and suppliers.” The joint announcement was made at the first general session at ACTE’s annual Global Travel Conference (Europe), held in Paris 14-16 October 2015. ACTE and CAPA are building on an alliance now in its third year. The two groups also announced cooperation on nine major corporate travel summits in the Australasian markets for next year.
