Wild and undeveloped, the park preserves a 13-mile-wide crater of a dormant supervolcano, home to elk herds, grasslands and pine forests. The park offers few roads and services, and hosts just 10 primitive campsites for Saturday-night stays only, with no water and electricity. Visiting hikers, cyclists, snowshoers and cross-country skiers are encouraged to bring all supplies with them. The nearest gas station is 20 miles away.\nWOLF PHOTO SAFARI IN YELLOWSTONE\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
