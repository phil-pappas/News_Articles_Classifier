Nominated by his team for his exceptional leadership during a time of major investment and significant change for the iconic QEII Centre, Taylor outshone a number of other leading industry figures to claim the title. \nJane Longhurst, chief executive of the mia, said: “The nominations for this award were outstanding as you would expect from a passionate and innovative industry,” said Jane. “The judges selected the recipient of this award based on their knowledge of his 30 years in the industry, his passion, commitment and dedication to delivering cultural change. “The nomination for him came from his team who highlighted the difference he has made at his current venue, his commitment to the customer journey and the way he has galvanized his team to rebrand and reposition the venue.” Joining the iconic meetings and events venue the QEII Centre as Chief Executive in April 2013, Mark Taylor has worked alongside his team to evolve this iconic brand and deliver the ambition to become London’s finest specialist events venue with a diverse portfolio of events and a global reputation as a beacon of British excellence. Mark’s recognition that change management can only be successful if all staff are engaged and involved is evidenced by the successful completion within two years of three phases of a £12 million capital investment programme to re-establish the centre’s ‘wow factor’. Mark has also initiated the Exception Performance Scheme which is a cash reward for staff who go above and beyond by recommending ways to improve the business. He now regularly hosts quarterly full team updates. This programme followed a strategic audit involving all departments to solicit feedback and ideas and has seen the centre achieve stellar financial results. In the financial year 2014/15, more than 400 events were hosted with room hire revenue growing by 18.7% compared to 2013/14 and the best trading results across all income streams since 2009/10. June 2014 saw the centre deliver its highest ever occupancy level and revenue generating month since it opened 29 years ago. It is estimated that the centre contributed an economic impact to the London and UK economy of £122 million in 2014/15*. Speaking of his miaList 2015 Leadership Award win, Mark Taylor said: “I am absolutely delighted to have received such a prestigious award. Having been in the industry for all these years, one has seen many fantastic high achievers receive such accolades. What I am particularly proud of is that this has come about from a nomination from my team. The QEII team is a remarkable lean machine of exceedingly experienced and talented individuals. Venue management is of course a team sport and I do think that the centre fields one of the best teams operating at the top of the league table. “Together over the last two and a half years, we have been on an amazing journey of revitalisation and rejuvenation of the QEII, both physically and philosophically and the achievements over this period have been significant. “It’s been an incredible week for us at the QEII Centre all round, as QEII Live has just scooped Team of the Year at the prestigious AV Awards 2015. We have also won a high commendation at this year’s C&IT Awards for Best UK Conference Venue, which follows on from our gold award for ‘Large Venue of the Year’ at Evcom’s Eventia Awards 2014. Our end of year results were a triumph and I congratulate my whole team for the part they’ve played in achieving them.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:03:23.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
