Because, believe it or not, the colour you pick for the bodywork can give an interesting insight into your psyche. White After a surge in popularity, the UK’s favourite car colour – or rather, shade – is white, making up almost a quarter of new cars registered in 2014. With a 22 per cent market share, white makes for the highest proportion since records began, taking it from less than one per cent a decade ago. According to colour psychology white is a shade we are drawn to when looking for mental clarity. So, if these latest statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders are anything to go by, then as a nation we are becoming increasingly focused. “Personality-wise, you’ll go for white if you like everything clean and in its place,” explains colour psychologist Karen Haller. “Someone buying a white car is unlikely to have a smelly rugby kit languishing in the footwell, or a half-eaten packet of crisps going stale on the passenger seat. This is the kind of person who likes order and routine in their lives. They can’t stand mess and clutter.” Black Next in popularity is black, which came in with 19 per cent. This is often the shade used to symbolize threat and menace, but it is also popular as an indicator of power and style. “Someone who opts for a black car probably enjoys an element of mystery, and will want to be viewed as serious and not someone you would want to mess about as they pull up in it,” says Haller. “There might be an element of arrogance in the mix too.” Grey Grey, which came third in the popularity stakes, is often chosen by people who want to blend into the background. “Someone in a grey car doesn’t want anyone knowing very much about them at all,” suggests Haller. “They want to hide their personality.” Blue According to YouGov, the colour people most commonly choose as their favourite is blue. In Britain, 33 per cent of people say it’s their number one – the highest percentage of any colour by far. And it’s the leading shade in many other countries, too, including the US, Germany, Australia and China. But when it comes to picking a car, it falls fourth behind white, black and grey. The people who select it are happy to veer outside the norm and aren’t afraid of being noticed on the road. “Light blue is a fun, sociable colour,” says Haller. Red The fifth most common shade is red and it’s not for the timid. We often think of people showing off by purchasing a cherry-red sports car – and Karen agrees that it’s generally a colour for people who are seeking attention. “Red screams out ‘I’m fun – look at me’,” she says. Does colour matter? But what if you aren’t in a position to decide the colour of your car at the point of manufacture? Many of us buy from second-hand dealers and are looking more for a reliable motor and a good deal. Kylie Warwick is a salesperson at Airport Garage in Ipswich, and says she always sits down with customers to discuss colour preferences before talking through what cars are available. “I ask ‘are you fussy about the colour?’ and the most common answers are ‘I’ll take anything apart from green because it’s unlucky’ or that the only colours they’ll accept are white, black or red. “Sometimes people don’t want the same colour car they once had an accident in, and I think our more reserved clients tend to be drawn to silver.” Spend more time laughing and less time worrying behind the wheel.
