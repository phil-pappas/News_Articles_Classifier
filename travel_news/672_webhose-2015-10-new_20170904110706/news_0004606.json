(Photo: Adam Alexander Photography)\n85 CONNECT 22 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE CHICAGO — There's a reason the Marszewki family included the word \"community\" in the name of their Bridgeport bar in South Side Chicago.\n\"There's more of a neighborhood feel,\" Mike Marszewski, owner of Maria's Packaged Goods and Community Bar, says of Bridgeport. \"When I lived on the North Side, I didn't know my neighbors.\"\nHe knows his neighbors now, and he's determined to invest in the Bridgeport neighborhood. His mother, Maria, the namesake of the bar, took over the property in 1987 when it was Kaplan's Liquors. In that time, it's changed from a tavern and packaged-goods store to a craft beer and cocktail magnet for locals and hipsters — a destination bar.\n\"We call it the community of the future,\" Marszewski says of Bridgeport.\nThe announcement that President Barack Obama will have his library and museum built in the South Side of Chicago is a testament to the growing influence of communities such as Bridgeport, traditionally a working-class neighborhood, and nearby Hyde Park, which houses the prestigious University of Chicago. Officials have yet to decide the exact location of the library, but the contenders are Washington Park and Jackson Park near the University of Chicago, where Obama once taught. The Obamas have a home on the border of Kenwood and Hyde Park.\nThe culinary scene is flourishing and new breweries and entertainment venues are popping up. A burgeoning arts scene is attracting culturally-minded visitors as well.\nThe South Side of Chicago has had a reputation for being gritty and crime-infested, but many of its neighborhoods are evolving into vibrant communities that are drawing people from the usual attractions downtown.\n\"The whole South Side gets labeled as the dangerous section of the city and that's just not the case,\" says Jason Lesniewicz, cultural tourism manager for Choose Chicago, the tourism authority for the city.\nHyde Park has traditionally been a stable bedroom community, but a culinary renaissance is giving it a vibrant commercial base it had very little of before.\nChef Matthias Merges, who worked at the famed Charlie Trotter's, chose Hyde Park to expand his culinary empire, in recent years opening Japanese-inspired Yusho and northern Italian A10.\nMerges says Hyde Park was a gastronomic wasteland when he arrived.\nCraft breweries are popping up all over Chicago.\n\"People thought we were nuts to come down here,\" he says over a lunch at Yusho that includes cornmeal-crusted oyster steam buns and French fries loaded with ginger and spicy aioli. \"It turned out to be a positive thing for us.\"\nAfter lunch, he takes me on a tour of the neighborhood, probably best known for the university and the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Robie House. Construction cranes are everywhere.\n“The library is going to be a big game changer,” he says.\nThe University of Chicago will have a role in running the Obama Library and museum. Judging by the museums they already have on the campus, it’s a good choice. The Oriental Institute was founded in 1919 and has an impressive collection of antiquities from Egypt, Iran, Syria, and other countries in that region.\nHighlights from Egypt include a fragment from the tomb of a woman named Diesehebsed, who sang in a divine chorus that entertained the god Amun during rituals, and a colossal statue of a king of late Dynasty 18, believed to be Tutankhamun.\nSix miles away, the Bridgeport neighborhood is drawing artists as well as chefs.\nOn a recent afternoon in Bridgeport, the Zhou B Art Center is buzzing with artists at work.\nThe sprawling complex houses 40 studios. Brothers DaHuang Zhou and Shan Zhou, both artists who moved to Bridgeport from China in 1986, opened the center in what used to be a factory in 2004.\nThe duo thought it would be \"good to bring artists together and also would be good for the development and culture of the neighborhood,\" says DaHuang Zhou.\nArtist Amy Donaldson was searching for an up-and-coming art district when she decided to move to Chicago from Florida. She settled into the Zhou B Art Center two years ago.\n\"Bridgeport came highly recommended and is respected by the art community,\" she says. \"I see it growing every day and it's an evolving community. I'm excited to see what's next. It's definitely going to be the next art Mecca of Chicago.\"\nIt's a designation that few would have thought Bridgeport would achieve decades ago when it was fraught with racial tensions. The neighborhood has been home to five mayors, including two members of the famous Daley political family, and was known for rivalries that played out block by block and parish by parish.\nOver the years, affordable housing prices have attracted immigrants from China and Europe, making Bridgeport one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in the city.\n\"There's a new contemporary culture,\" says Ed Marszewski, Mike's brother and owner of Marz Community Brewing, a craft beer producer.\nFive years ago, the brothers decided to re-do Kaplan's Liquors. While it remains a classic slashie — half liquor store, half neighborhood tavern — it now has a more stylish look. The benches are made with recycled and reclaimed hardwood flooring. A chandelier was fashioned out of bottles. Table tops are actually butcher blocks. A refurbished Art Deco-style cooler holds craft beers. The clientele is a mixture of young and hip and older, more traditional.\nOn a recent evening, a chalkboard advertises the \"Bartender's Choice\" for $4. I ask the bartender what his choice is on a recent evening.\n\"It's a roll of the dice,\" says Ken Zawacki.\nI decide not to roll the dice and order the Marszewski Mule with ginger beer, Laird's Vodka and organic lime juice.\n\"There's so much possibility,\" Ed Marszewski says. \"I always believe you can do anything you want in Chicago but you have a better chance of doing it in our neighborhood.\"\nKevin Hickey certainly believed so when he opened Duck Inn nine months ago.\nThe chef grew up in Bridgeport but moved away for about 23 years, living and working in cities such as San Francisco and London.\nWhen he decided it was time to open a restaurant in Bridgeport, he took over a corner building that had been a neighborhood tavern since the early 1900s. His goal was to turn it into a restaurant where locals and visitors can have an affordable meal on the casual patio or splurge on fancier fare in the upscale dining room.\n\"It seemed like a great opportunity and timing for the neighborhood,\" he says. \"Bridgeport reminds me of Brooklyn five or 10 years ago.\"\n85 CONNECT 22 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1RwAaNt TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/1LkJN0R", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799257173678254-AAlexander-HydePark-55.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RwAaNt&text=South%20Side%20story%3A%20Chicago%27s%20urban%20renaissance&via=usatoday", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543827125001_IMG-4540.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799257173678254-AAlexander-HydePark-55.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543821102001_4543734565001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RwAaNt&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1RwAaNt", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543827125001_IMG-4540.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/044e9943a9163c10d160e2b733d6b55267070e39/c=0-0-3192-2400&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799257173678254-AAlexander-HydePark-55.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543827125001_IMG-4540.jpg?pubId=29906170001"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:35:11.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
