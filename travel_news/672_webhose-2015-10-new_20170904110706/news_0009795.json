Bathrooms are called Pods, equipped with rain shower, LED mood lighting, spa-branded amenities and bluetooth music speakers. \n\n\nThere will also be communal spaces named Nest, which encourages strangers to interact and relax over complimentary refreshments such as hot beverages, sodas, snacks and ice-cream. The lobby, called Void, will offer relaxation pods, while the all-day restaurant and bar Nook provides an array of breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Other facilities include a spa, a fitness centre and kids club. \n\nThe first Dhawa-branded hotel will open in Bo’ao, China, in March 2016. Dhawa Bo’ao will be a 346-key establishment featuring the above amenities as well as banquet and meeting facilities. The 516-key Dhawa Cayo Las Brujas in Cuba will follow, slated for an opening in July 2016. \n\n“We have signed projects for this fourth brand in China, in Pu’er, Leishan and Luo Yang, and we will likely open one of our own in Phuket,” added Ho. \n\nDhawa sits alongside the group’s sister brands Angsana, Banyan Tree and Cassia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:15:44.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
