As one of the pilot users, I’ve found the features that are being developed a major step forward.”\nDoug Anderson, president & CEO, CWT, said: “Our goal is to take our clients from a world of facts, figures and reports to a world of connections, insights and possibilities. Our aim is to not only change how we deliver travel data but change the industry for good.”\nCWT was named number one TMC in BBT’s 2015 Top 50 UK TMCs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:59:11.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
