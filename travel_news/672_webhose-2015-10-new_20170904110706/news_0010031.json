Photo: PackTowl Bring along the PackTowl Nano Towel, and you can give your clothes... Gear review: PackTowl Nano Towel 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nOn the road, your clothing items become much more than a way to cover your body. They take on the responsibility of napkins and towels — keeping your hands and face dry, and even wipe off your glasses and ski goggles when they become foggy. Bring along the PackTowl Nano Towel, and you can give your clothes a rest. The larger of the two sizes (medium) measures 18 by 33 inches and weighs only 0.9 ounces, so it’s easy to squeeze in a daypack, handlebar bag, or carry-on. Keep it in its mesh bag until you need it, then when you need to clean the towel, just machine wash it and tumble dry (or hang dry using the convenient snap loop). \nWhat we liked: The towel soaks up twice its weight in water and then wrings out almost completely dry, for as many times as you need it to. \nNot so much: The size of the towel may disappoint those of you who are used to wrapping your post-shower self in something. Find another habit. \nVitals: PackTowl Nano Towel, $7.95 or $9.95 (depending on size) from www.packtowl.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:14:51.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
