After a scenic drive cross country on Highways 54 and 73 to the south or via Highway D and the Pomme de Terre area, you’ll find one of the cultural centers of the Ozarks. Bolivar offers museums and art galleries in addition to outdoor fun. The Ella Carothers Dunnegan Gallery of Art at 511 N. Pike St. features the impressive art collections of the Dunnegan and Wainscott families. Now through Nov. 1, the gallery is featuring the works of artists from all over the U.S. and Canada in the 25th annual juried art exhibition, Best of America 2015. Sponsored by the National Oil and Acrylic Painters’ Society, the show includes more than 100 paintings selected from over 700 entries. The gallery is open 1-4 p.m. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. A short walk from the gallery, learn more about Ozark history with a stop at the North Ward Museum at 201 W. Locust. Early Polk County artifacts are on display in a building that previously served as a local school. Art Sync is another gallery - this one a cooperative gallery owned by local artists through the Polk County Artist Association. On West San Marten, it is open Wednesdays-Saturdays 11 a.m.-5 p.m. For a more hands-on art experience, try Fired Up Pottery and Art on the east side of the historic Bolivar square where you can paint your pottery or take a class on wheel throwing pottery or painting on canvas. While you’re in this part of town, be sure to hit some of the cute shops downtown. Head outdoors in Bolivar with a beautiful fall hike on the Frisco Highline Trail. An impressive 35-plus miles long, connecting Bolivar with Springfield, this trail is Missouri’s second longest. Open to hikers and bicyclists, it was formerly a rail line that hosted Harry Truman during his “Whistlestop” campaign in 1948. All the rail line is gone now, offering a quiet sanctuary to contemplate nature as you wind through woods and pastures. The route includes 16 bridges including Broadway Bridge in Bolivar. At mile marker 32 near the Bolivar end of the trail, the route also passes through La Petite Gemme Prairie. This virgin prairie features the native tall grass prairie that once covered nearly a third of the state. Located two miles south and one mile west of Bolivar on a gravel road off Highway 13, this 37-acre area is a surprising respite from the oak-hickory forests of the Ozarks. Find the Bolivar Trailhead for the Frisco Highline by taking the Highway 32 exit from Highway 13 and go east. Just before the downtown square, the street goes under the former railroad Broadway Bridge now painted with murals. Just east of the underpass is a the trailhead parking area.
