The group will visit popular birding sites in Trinidad and Tobago including Speyside, Asa Wright Nature Centre, Yerette, Hacienda Jacana and the Caroni Bird Sanctuary. \nSolomon indicated that initiatives such as the guide and birding FAM are part of an ongoing thrust by the TDC to raise the profile of the islands as an eco and soft adventure destination. \n“The visiting group will have an opportunity to interact with local guides who are intimately familiar with the country's ecosystems and experience the vast diversity of the best bird watching areas in Trinidad and Tobago,” Solomon revealed. \nTrinidad and Tobago is also hosting two additional FAM trips for 2015 including a FAM for travel agents who were recently certified as Trinidad and Tobago Specialists and a Super FAM which has attracted US wholesale tour operators, travel agents and Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) like Expedia, Booking.com and Orbit to facilitate one-on-one meetings with local hotels and other private sector stakeholders. \nAbout Trinidad & Tobago \nHome to the largest Carnival celebration in the Caribbean, Trinidad & Tobago is the southernmost Caribbean nation located seven miles east off the Venezuelan coast.
