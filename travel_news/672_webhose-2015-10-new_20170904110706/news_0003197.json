But they make sure the size of the company’s ships is always used to its best advantage. “We actually have the edge over the majority of cruise lines,” says James, speaking from Saga HQ in Kent, overlooking the English Channel. “A ship can be too big for some ports, but rarely too small!” And with no more than 449 guests aboard Saga Pearl II and 720 on Saga Sapphire, these ships really are small compared to the current trend for huge liners that cram as many as 5,000 people on board. “Next year we’ve created a special voyage around the Baltic Sea, sailing to some of the smaller, more interesting ports that other cruise lines simply wouldn’t be able to fit into.” James is referring to the Viking town of Hundested, on the Danish island of Zealand. Saga’s visit in 2016 will make them the world’s first cruise line to dock in the tiny harbour. There are no queues at the restaurants or entertainment venues and, most importantly, no massive crowds when you want to get off the ship “Saga Pearl II will sail in accompanied by Viking-style ships, then guests will be welcomed ashore by authentic Vikings, before setting off for tours to the longship museum and Norse market,” says James. It’s just one of many unusual ports. Saga was also one of the first to call at Wismar, a Hanseatic town on Germany’s north coast which has since become a firm favourite on Baltic cruise itineraries. “Of course we’ll be visiting the big must-see attractions too, like mooring for two nights in St Petersburg. Everyone wants the time to really explore this city, so we give our customers what they want. \"Our aim is to break up the itinerary, mixing well-known ports with out-of- the-way places for a unique Saga experience.” Life at sea on a boutique Saga ship also offers a more personal touch. The staff get to know their guests by name and service is warm and friendly. It also means no queues at the restaurants or entertainment venues and, most importantly, no massive crowds when you want to get off the ship. “A big part of our small-ship experience is enjoying a port without it being swarmed with thousands of tourists – which is especially important in small towns and places like the Norwegian fjords. We try to be the only ship in port so each call is more personal. \"As our numbers are more modest, it’s also easy to just hop on and off the ship. After all, who wants to spend time stuck in a queue when there’s so much to discover?” You may also like to read »» • Very interesting: take your hobby on holiday • Authentic holidays: immerse yourself in the real Cuba • Croatia’s top five Unesco World Heritage Sites For the latest travel news, sign up to the fortnightly Saga Navigator newsletter , or follow @SagaHolidaysUK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:28:14.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
