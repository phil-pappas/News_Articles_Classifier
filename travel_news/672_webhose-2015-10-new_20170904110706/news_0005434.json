Parham Road, represents the latest U-Haul® acquisition in the Richmond area.\nThe considerable 185,232-square-foot office and warehouse space was built in 1976 and housed McKesson® Medical-Surgical from 1994 until recently. U-Haul closed on the property Sept. 15 and is currently offering truck, trailer and U-Box container rentals.\nThe street address for this new U-Haul store was changed from 8741 Landmark Road.\n\"We will add a storage facility,\" store general manager Sovirak Top said. \"The plan is to build 3,000 storage units . We will add hitch bays. We have a U-Box warehouse. This will be a full-service U-Haul store.\n\"We needed a store in West End. The location was important. I'm excited because this will be one of the biggest locations for U-Haul and convenient for everyone in the area. Everyone I've spoken to has said this is a great location for them to get truck or trailer to help them move.\"\nThe acquisition of U-Haul Moving & Storage of West End was driven by U-Haul Company's Corporate Sustainability initiatives : U-Haul® supports infill development to help local communities lower their carbon footprint. Our adaptive reuse of existing buildings reduces the amount of energy and resources required for new-construction materials and helps cities reduce their unwanted inventory of unused buildings.\nCarlos Vizcarra , president of AMERCO Real Estate Company, noted that the E. Parham Road location would give U-Haul stores in Richmond more than 400,000 net rentable square feet of self-storage.\n\"The plan is to erect 126,000 net rentable square feet of self-storage in the existing building at U-Haul Moving & Storage of West End,\" Vizcarra said. \"U-Haul Moving and Storage at Lombardy (900 N. Lombardy) was previously our largest Richmond store with 112,924 net rentable square feet of self-storage.\"\nAmy Cox , marketing company president for U-Haul Company of Richmond , stated the new store is hiring and eventually plans to have 20 or more Team Members on staff.\nContact U-Haul Moving and Storage of West End at (804) 616-3629 or visit the store from 7 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday-Thursday and Saturday; 7 a.m.-8 p.m. Friday ; and 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Sunday .
