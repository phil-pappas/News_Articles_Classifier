One idea that's fun is to take an aerial tour of the Grand Canyon, and you can catch one in Arizona or Nevada. You can fly by airplane or helicopter, and there are several options to add. That makes it easy to find a fun tour that fits with your interests and budget. Best Grand Canyon Chopper ToursFlights to the Grand Canyon operate on the usual schedule over Halloween, in fact, there are flights every day of the year except for Christmas Day. If you're flying from the Vegas area, then flights will leave from The Strip, nearby Boulder City, or Henderson. If you'll be in Arizona instead, then departing from Tusayan is more convenient since the airport in Tusayan is near the gates at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. The advantage of taking a Vegas tour is that those tours can land at the West Rim. The air-only tours are fun too, but the landing tours pack in extra adventure. You can choose to land at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, the top, or even both. If you go to the bottom of the Canyon, you can enjoy a champagne picnic or even a boat ride along the Colorado River, and if you go to the top of the rim, you can experience the Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Skywalk is a stunning glass and metal platform which sits almost 4000ft above the bottom of the Canyon. You'll have the illusion of walking on air. You can purchase air flights that include Skywalk tickets in the package. The flights that depart from Arizona aren't allowed to land on the Canyon, but they make up for it in the beautiful scenery you'll see on a tour. There are two choices in the tours based on the amount of flight time they offer. One tour lasts about a half an hour, while the second tour is nearly an hour long. The longer tour is worth the extra cost because you will see the park from the South Rim to the North Rim and over to the eastern border of the park. In all, the longer tour covers about 3/4 of the national park, and it is one of the most comprehensive tours available. Basic And Deluxe ToursYou have your choice of flying on a basic or deluxe tour. While there is nothing wrong with a basic tour, it flies on the older helicopters. Even though they aren't considered the ultimate in sightseeing aircraft, they are still safe to ride in and you'll have great views. The best flights are on deluxe tours, and they are worth the extra cost. Deluxe tours use EcoStar 130 helicopters. They have roomier cabins and you'll be a lot more comfortable during your tour. The seats are carefully arranged, so there is no bad seat on the helicopter with obstructed views, plus, the windscreen wraps around the aircraft for panoramic viewing. Also, the deluxe tours that fly out of Vegas lift off right from the Strip and you'll get free ground transportation in a limo. The basic tours lift off from airfields in the suburbs, and you'll need to take a shuttle bus ride to get to your chopper. Grand Canyon Airplane ToursYou can also choose to tour by airplane, and the ones at the South Rim follow the same flight path as the helicopters. The planes fly at a higher altitude though, so the views aren't as nice as what you get in a chopper. Plane tours are fun and scenic though, and they are the perfect option if you're touring with a group because an airplane can hold up to 19 people per flight. Airplane tours cost less than helicopter tours too, so if your budget is tight, then an airplane tour might be the best choice for you. Wrapping UpSo consider your options. Do you want a basic tour or a more comfy deluxe version? Would you rather fly in a helicopter or an airplane? North Rim, or South Rim? You'll have a lot of choices, that's for sure. Start with a departure location close to you and buy the best package you can afford. Think of the memories you'll make if you book a champagne tour of the West Rim. Since Halloween is almost here, you need to book your tour now. Be sure to book your tour online too, because you'll get a great discount that way, plus you'll have a lot of variety in tour options to ensure you create a Halloween tour you'll never forget.
