There’s a slot for a barber, and there’s Ping’s Restaurant.\nInside, the air is heavy and has a vaguely unpleasant smell. Fishmongers chop away at a vacant-eyed, 2-foot-long catch. A gutted armadillo lies on its back, awaiting a customer. In another huge room, prepared food is for sale. A pharmacy offers conventional fare along with folk potions and herbal remedies.\nThroughout, there’s the din of languages — Dutch (the official language), Sranan Tongo (the local creole dialect), Hindi, Javanese and the languages of the Maroon and Amerindian natives.\nNjoek (pronounced “nuke”), our guide for today, effortlessly shifts from English to Dutch to whatever as she sweet-talks vendors into letting my girlfriend and me photograph them. She also sweet-talks us into trying peanuts, ginger beer, a coffee-cake-like delicacy called viado , and pastei , a meat pie of chicken, carrots and peas.\nSuriname — called Dutch Guiana until 1954 — sits on South America’s northeast coast, with French Guiana to the east, Guyana to the west and Brazil to the south. For a country of only about half a million, it has an amazing diversity of cultures. The Dutch colonized it in the 1600s and used slave labor from Africa to grow coffee, sugar cane and cotton on plantations. They abolished slavery in the mid-1800s and turned to indentured workers from Indonesia, China and India. Today this amalgam of cultures exists amicably. Paramaribo may be the only city in the world where you’ll find a mosque next to a synagogue as well as the intersection of Indira Gandhi/JFK Highway with MLK Highway.\nIn late March of 2014, we spent 11 days exploring this mix of cultures, history and the Amazon jungle through a package put together by the Great Canadian Travel Co.\nLate in the afternoon of our first day in Paramaribo (pronounced “Par-uh-MAR-ih-bo”), culture and nature combined on the Suriname River as we watched pink dolphins swim amid a cluster of fishermen in small boats. Snowy egrets perched here and there on the boats, hoping to snatch a fish when nets were pulled in.\nA bit later, our guide, Landi, motored up a narrow channel to a small village that had been a plantation. In the mangroves that lined the waterway, an orange howler monkey jumped through the foliage just above our heads.\nThe next day, “oohs” and “ahhs” erupted as large blue morpho butterflies occasionally flitted ahead of our narrow motorized canoes on tiny Warappa Creek. We were staying overnight in modest (but air-conditioned) lodgings at the nearby small settlement of Bakkie. Sampling another culture, our dinner would be roti, an Indian dish of chicken and potatoes with a curry sauce, eaten by wrapping it in chunks of flatbread.\nMost of the land in this area was once plantations, and it’s crisscrossed by footpaths and small canals that irrigated the crops. While walking a path the next morning, our guide Yves chatted with a local farmer as he sat on his front porch, sorting through beans he’d harvested. In a day’s time, he said, he’ll pick through about 65 pounds of beans, discarding the bad ones.\nThe Maroon culture began to develop in the 1600s when African slaves escaped the plantations, fleeing into the jungle to set up their own societies. Today they may venture into Paramaribo to sell their produce or find work, but villages like Santigron, south of the capital, still remain insular and primitive. On the day we visited, there were few people out, and our guide, Juergen, warned that our cameras weren’t welcome — at least not until he greased a few palms.\nA plane ride away, a more modern culture mixes with nature at Kabalebo Nature Resort, an eco-resort in the wilds of the Amazon rain forest in west central Suriname. From our single-engine plane, the rain-forest canopy stretched to the horizon, unbroken save for the occasional snaking river. People and supplies get here only by plane, and the nearest village is 90 miles away.\nNature doesn’t give up its secrets here as readily as a National Geographic film. A toucan teasingly flies into a tree on the resort grounds, then as quickly disappears.\nOn a jungle path, macaws flit through the treetops, cackling mockingly. The occasional spider monkey swings high above.\nBut, on two nights, we watched in fascination as two ocelots warily chowed down on meat that had been placed out for them at the edge of the resort.\nWorth the trip.\nAfter our days in the rain forest, what else was there to do but be on top of the rain forest? Fishing for piranha and peacock bass was ostensibly the reason for our visit to Brokopondo Lake, but the landscape is what really attracted us.\nThis is one of the world’s largest reservoirs, and it covers more than 600 square miles of what used to be villages and vast areas of rain forest. Just the rain forest’s ghosts remain. At times, the depth finder on our boat showed the water to be 130 feet deep, yet the trunks of thousands of trees still jutted toward the sky, creating a wonderfully surreal picture.\nNo fish to take home that day. Just memories.\nPhil Marty is a Florida writer and photographer.\nWhen you go Getting there: Surinam Airways and Insel Air fly to Paramaribo from Miami. Round-trip fares are apt to be in the $700 range including taxes and fees.\nThe trip: The Complete Suriname package from the Great Canadian Travel Co. is priced from $2,545 per person double occupancy for 10 days/nine nights. We extended our trip by one day and night so we could go to Brokopondo Lake. The package price includes lodging in Paramaribo, Bakkie and Kabalebo; various guided tours; round-trip airfare to Kabalebo; activities in Kabalebo and all meals there. 1-800-661-3830. tinyurl.com/nl8d3d5 .\nThe essentials: In addition to routine vaccines, the Centers for Disease Control ( cdc.gov ) recommends travelers to Suriname be inoculated for hepatitis A, typhoid and yellow fever. Malaria medication is also a good idea.
