Take a cruise through the photos above, which offer a first look at the swankiest suites on Norwegian Cruise Line’s new Norwegian Escape . \nSetting sail Sunday on its maiden voyage with paying customers, the 4,248-passengers vessel is one of the largest cruise ships ever built and features some of the most spectacular suites at sea, including 55 that are incorporated into a private enclave called The Haven that has its own pool, sun deck, lounge and restaurant. \nClick HERE to see the photos in larger format. \nUSA TODAY is getting a sneak peek at the just-completed ship this week as it works its way from the German shipyard where it was built to its future home in Miami. Scheduled to sail year-round to the Caribbean, it’ll be christened in the city on Nov. 9 in a ceremony headlined by American rapper Pitbull . \nAt 164,600 tons, Escape is the fifth largest cruise ship ever built and the largest ever at Norwegian. An expanded version of Norwegian’s recently unveiled Norwegian Getaway , it boasts one of the largest deck-top fun zones at sea with four major water slides; a restaurant-lined boardwalk; a giant spa with a flurries-filled Snow Room; and several other first-for-the line or the industry features. \nFor our first photos of the vessel’s public areas, including its many restaurants, bars, lounges and pool areas, scroll through the carousel below.
