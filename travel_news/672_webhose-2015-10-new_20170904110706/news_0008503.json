AFP Two processions set out from Gaza after Friday prayers, one in the direction of Nahal Oz and the other in the direction of the Erez Crossing, to protest Israeli policy on Temple Mount and to show solidarity with West Bank Palestinians. The media in Gaza reported the incidents under the headline “Palestine waged an intifada .”\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said in a homily he gave in Gaza Friday afternoon that Gaza is ready for confrontation in the battle, which he called “The Battle of Al-Quds,” referring to Jerusalem’s Arabic name. Haniyeh said in the Palestine Mosque in central Gaza that the third intifada had begun, and that it had opened in the cities of the West Bank.\n“We tried 20 years of negotiations and attempts at a deal, and the result was losing the way and internal fights,” said Haniyeh. “Therefore, there is a need to deepen the intifada, strengthening it and keeping it burning among our sons and daughters until liberation.”\nPalestinians also reported clashes all across the West Bank, including Hebron, Bethlehem and Beit El, describing them as “the harshest clashes since the outbreak of riots.”\nJack Khoury\nHaaretz Correspondent\n ", "external_links": ["http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:05:00.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
