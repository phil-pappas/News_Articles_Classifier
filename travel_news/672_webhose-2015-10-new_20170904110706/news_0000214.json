LOUIS (AP) â€” On a hike about 18 months ago, Cole Donelson and his wife, Elizabeth, wondered aloud about the possibility of visiting every national park.\n\"Then we just sort of said, 'Why not?'\" Cole Donelson recalled.\nSo the St. Louis-area natives who were working and living in Kansas City, Missouri, took on second jobs to save as much money as possible, then quit all of their jobs and took off.\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch ( http://bit.ly/1W4OFZE ) reports that the Donelsons, both 26, plan to visit all 59 national parks before the park system celebrates its 100th anniversary next summer, finishing Aug. 18 at St. Louis' national park, the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, which includes the Gateway Arch.\nThe first leg of the adventure took them to Colorado, Arizona, Utah and Nevada and famous parks including Zion, Bryce Canyon and the Grand Canyon.\nThe second leg started at Cuyahoga Valley in Ohio. They will then head to Acadia in Maine and other parks in the Northeast.\nThe third leg will go through Southern parks. The fourth is in the Northwest and Alaska. The fifth is Hawaii and American Samoa, before the return to St. Louis.\nCole Donelson grew up in Wildwood. Elizabeth graduated from high school in Washington, about 40 miles from the city. They met at the University of Missouri . They married two years ago and took jobs in Kansas City, where she was a teacher and he worked in information technology.\nHe took a second job as an Uber driver and she sold furniture to collect enough money for their dream. After quitting, they told their parents about their travel plans.\n\"At first, I don't think they believed we were going to do it, so it was like 'sure, kids, go ahead,'\" Elizabeth said.\n\"But when it seemed like we actually were going to do it, they got super parent-y and started telling us about insurance and car maintenance,\" she said. \"Then after we actually had our schedule laid out, they started telling us all the places they wanted to meet us.\"\nThe Donelsons spend at least four days at each park to get a sense of its unique features. Beyond hiking, they try an activity at each one.\n\"We did some fly-fishing in Black Canyon of the Gunnison,\" Cole said. \"And we're taking our kayak on this second leg.\"\nWhich park has been their favorite? Impossible to answer, they say.\n\"They're all amazing. So we talk about something special in each one,\" Cole said.\n___\nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1W4OFZE", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:51:25.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
