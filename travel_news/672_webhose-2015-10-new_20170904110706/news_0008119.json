Be it with high-speed ICE trains, modern long-distance buses, limousines or helicopter services, Lufthansa and its various transport partners offer customers a wide range of travel options to or from the airport to further enhance their overall travel experience. \nBy bringing these various services under a single brand name, Lufthansa is offering a wide range of local or regional travel options from a single source that customers can book individually in addition to their Lufthansa flight. In concrete terms, the current AIRail service will now be known as Lufthansa Express Rail, Lufthansa Airport Bus becomes Lufthansa Express Bus and the present Airport Shuttle Service will now be publicized as Lufthansa Express Shuttle. The new brand will further be home to Rail & Fly in collaboration with Lufthansa Express, to Lufthansa Express Helicopter and to Lufthansa Express Chauffeur. A further new service  Lufthansa Express Carsharing  should also be added soon. \nOur intermodal strategy is designed to provide our customers with a travel process that is as smooth and seamless as possible, from their region of origin right through to their final air destination or vice versa, says Markus Pauly, Lufthansas Director of Infrastructure & Development at its Frankfurt hub. In doing so, we can tangibly enhance their overall travel experience, by offering them all the mobility options they need within our service portfolio. \nLH.com , via the Lufthansa app or with any travel agency. \nLH.com/Express . \nhttp://photos.webwire.com/prmedia/2/200623/200623-1.jpg )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:20:20.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
