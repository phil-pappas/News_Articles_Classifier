No carbs, no dairy, and don’t even look twice at sugar — even if it comes home in the form of a lolly bag from a kid’s birthday party.\nPete Evans has revealed how the diet has not only changed his life, but also the lives of his wife and two daughters, Indii and Chilli.\nHe said replacing the bad stuff with the good wasn’t a challenge for his family, even when it comes down to sweet temptations.\n“We’re so much healthier, and that comes down to the fact that we’ve ditched gluten, dairy, processed foods and refined carbohydrates and sugars,” he said in an interview for his latest venture, The Paleo Way Magazine .\nChef Pete Evans at the opening night of his restaurant, Asanain, in Brisbane. Picture: Mark Calleja “Honestly, there haven’t been too many challenges because once I made this lifestyle adjustment and commitment to living paleo, I knew I wanted to stick to my guns. I’m pretty determined once I put my mind to something,” he said.\n“It’s interesting because they [daughters] generally make the right choices, even when I’m not there, which is awesome.”\nOther Stories Police trace terror gun trail to two young men News Council mergers spell doom for Salim Nsw 0 comments ‘It’s clear Hayne is not the man for the job’ More Sports 0 comments Tahnee: How I deal with big boobs Lifestyle Bedlam as France mutiny ‘sacks coach’ Rugby 0 comments Rugby league’s last survivors Nrl 0 comments An example stems from a kid’s birthday party, where his two girls returned home with a bag of lollies and asked if they could keep the gifts.\nChilli and Indii Evans. Picture: Instagram Pete admitted to turning the question back on his daughters, by asking if they would feed a pet bunny bad foods, even when they know the rabbit should only eat grass and water. His girls agreed they would only feed the animals good foods.\n“What if the bunnies wanted to eat lollies because the other bunnies in the street were and\nthere was a chance that maybe their bunnies would get sick or not live as long or be in pain, would they ever feed the bunnies the lollies?” he said in the interview.\nBoth daughters agreed they would stick to their guns and continue feeding their hypothetical pets the right diet.\n“I said that they need to think of themselves as ‘bunnies’ and hopefully they will learn to make wise choices when it comes to what they feed themselves.”\nBut Pete isn’t the only chef who poses questions to his children before they make un paleo-like food choices.\nMasterChef judge George Calombaris revealed he would send his young son to birthday parties at McDonald’s with a packed lunch, because he doesn’t want him indulging in fast food. Calombaris told News Corp in July this year his method wasn’t about being “the fun-police” but rather treating his food like a religion.\nMasterChef host George Calombaris with his son James. Picture: Supplied “In life, we’ve all got religions. Some are Buddhists, some are this, some are that, whatever, and we respect people in Australia for whatever religion that is. For me, I look at food like my religion and I have my beliefs in food. My son knows ... we’ll drive past a certain fast food chain and he’ll go, ‘that’s bad in there, isn’t it, Dad?’ and I explain it’s not about bad, it’s about having choices in life,” he said in the interview.\nPsychologist and parent of three girls Sandy Rea raised concern over parents taking complete control when it comes to a child’s diet.\n“I don’t approve of being overly controlling with a child’s diet. There should be variety in a diet and treats on occasion. There are special occasions in life. I’m sure Pete grew up on sweets,” Sandy said.\n“Each to their own when it comes to parenting, however, I think we are social animal and we/kids like to be part of the pack.”\nDid Cooking Make Us Human 51:58 With the Paleo trend still courting controversy, Horizon investigates how early humans really ate - and whether cooking made us who we are today.\nJune 8th 2015 4 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/TV/Documentary/ Originally published as Buzzkill Pete bans childhood institution", "external_links": ["http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/origin:video_integrator.s2ZHRqdTovBARIdC7INdZe2O9h5q55ed?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/pete-evans-rejects-lolly-bags-from-a-kids-birthday-party/story-fneuz8zj-1227570351832?sv=c5c06eded0dca1848c4ad484bb1cff44", "http://sandyreapsychology.com.au/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fgenerated%2Fprod%2F06%2F08%2F2015%2F125384%2Fimage1024x768.jpg%3Fcount%3D4&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fef8ad6a3a58c2908cff914c0e11c7d7?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4be261c48ba80e21feb2435c3ab17475", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7w4W2qAQN_c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8c6513aec5e3604f4856c3c87076e993?width=650", "https://thepaleoway.com/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0fd6e9634c550e901a1cfd4cd6fac032", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/mac-attack-masterchef-judge-george-calombaris-bans-his-boy-from-eating-mcdonalds/story-fn907478-1227443150453", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1c4827c9f681d25b5c1ffa8df29bc178", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f5a90de7a627731e7b15952f54824b8c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dabe7224ad6142587417739ef46b521c?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c1273975189af34d0531aaf2761cc22d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8915b948c34fec311f8af2033aea6844", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-10-16T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:58:30.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
