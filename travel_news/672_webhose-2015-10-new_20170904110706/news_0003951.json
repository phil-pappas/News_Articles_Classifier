Those stubby little biros about three inches long? There were two places you would find them: a betting shop, or a branch of catalogue retailer Argos (three places if you count a journalist’s desk — who knew so many shopped at Argos?). \nSoon, though, they will be a thing of the past. High-street bookie Ladbrokes has revealed that, since August, 20,000 traditional pen-wielding punters have been signed up to a new smartphone app while in store — and most now use the app to place and check multiple wagers (“track their accas” in the parlance) while still in a shop. Just two days earlier, Argos owner Home Retail Group said it was on track to open another 200 digital-format stores, where customers walk in, and click on giant iPads to select and collect goods. More New City world order / Tesco / LinkedIn \nRetail analysts call this a “multichannel offering”. Retail archeologists, when not wondering what the pens were for, are more likely to call it baffling. Why would anyone travel to a high street shop just to use mobile technology they already possess? \nAccording to Ladbrokes, “people like shops” — and people’s smartphone apps can track their location (as well as their accas) to alert them to offers at nearby shops. They can even bet via app and cash-out in store, providing readies that can be fed back into in-store gaming machines. \nIt seems to be working. While the group’s quarterly revenues were down 0.7 per cent year-on-year, its digital sales were up 6.4 per cent. Analysts also noted “better recycling”. \nBut it is not without cost. An advertising campaign featuring hirsute and decidedly post-pen betting philosophers has lifted Ladbrokes’ marketing spend to 30 per cent of net gaming revenue. This caused pre-tax profit to fall 57 per cent to £14.3m in the period. Ladbrokes has to keep spending, however, because it needs to make use of all that shop space. Although half of all in-store bets and 84 per cent of the money staked go into gaming machines, regulation says betting shops cannot be solely given over to them. Hence the need to make floor space pay, by selling digital apps (and acca trackers) to analogue types. \nWith Ladbrokes’ shop estate set to almost double to 4,000, after it merges with Gala Coral, it will need to make multichannel sign-ups a lot more cost effective, or hope it can dispose of some property. Argos’s digital shift could not prevent a profit warning this week. Ladbrokes will not want to find itself reaching for a big red pen. \nGrace-ful exit \n“Are you free, Mr Sharp?” If staff at Debenhams observed the department store etiquette of characters from BBC sitcom Are You Being Served , their chief executive would have to inform colleagues that, as of next year, he will be more fancy-free than the show’s doyen of menswear, Mr Humphries. \nAlongside results that showed like-for-like sales rose 2.1 per cent, CEO Michael Sharp has announced his intention to step down in 2016. \nBut while he was at pains to stress it had “always been his intention to serve a five-year term”, having been appointed in 2011, he is not exactly the octogenarian founder of TV’s Grace Brothers — and his move follows demands for management change from tough customers in the City. They felt that Debenhams share price, and its sales promotions, had represented too much of a bargain for far too long. \nMr Sharp denied this had played a part in his decision, although the company was keen to stress that it had cut promotional activity by 17 days and full price sales were up 7 per cent. \nStill, one retail analyst who has covered the sector since Grace Brothers closed it doors in 1985 suggests Debenhams problem is not that it is too like its fictional rival, but too unlike its real-life competitor: John Lewis. \nIn a squeezed middle market for department stores, John Lewis’s reputation for “customer service and a believable price promise” stands in contrast to Debenhams’ “price promotion led business” and failure to persuade customers to buy at full margin. Add uncertainty about the stake held by Sports Direct, and Debenhams’ refrain starts to sound a bit like its comic counterpart’s theme tune: “Ground floor perfumery, Boardroom buffoonery, Mike Ashley’s haberdashery, Kitchenware and food . . . going up?” \nSeeing stars \nAfter nearly a year, and 80 pages, of painstaking research, the Competition and Markets Authority has concluded that bank customers need help choosing the best account. This appears to be news to the report’s authors. If only they had been at the Guildhall this week to see the independent Fairbanking charity award star ratings to 19 banking products that “promote financial wellbeing”.
