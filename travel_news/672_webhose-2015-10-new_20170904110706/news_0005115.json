Mon, 19 Oct 2015 5:18 PM Share Your Email A statue in Pompeii. Credit: pixabay.com \nTourists who have stolen artifacts from the ancient city of Pompeii have been sending them back in droves - claiming the objects are cursed. \nThis is according to Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera . \nPompeii was covered in ash and pumice after Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79AD, killing the residents of the city. \nAccording to the newspaper, some believe that Pompeii is cursed because Mount Vesuvius' eruption was a punishment from the gods. \nThe punishment was incurred, according to legend, due to legionnaires destroying holy buildings. \nAnd now some tourists think the curse has been transferred to them. \nTourists who stole mementos have been sending them back with notes. \n\"At a certain point, people started believing in this story again. Even proper thieves have returned things to us,\" Pompeii's archaeological superintendent Massimo Osanna said according to Mail Online . \n\"They write that the stolen pieces have brought them nothing but trouble, they say they can trace back all their family troubles to their theft at Pompeii,\" Osanna said. \nOver the last few years, around 100 parcels have been sent back to Pompeii, containing stolen artifacts and fragments. \nOsanna is reportedly considering creating an exhibit from all the items which have been sent back.
