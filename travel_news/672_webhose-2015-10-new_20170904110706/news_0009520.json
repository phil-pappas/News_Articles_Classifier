It's one of those bucket-list destinations that must be experienced at least once in a lifetime. This high-octane showgirl is a mecca for hedonists and high rollers, but even the straightest of travellers find themselves seduced by her intoxicating energy. Come for the shows, casinos and cocktails, and beneath the neon facade you'll find a Downtown community in the midst of a revival. \nVISIT \nIn Sin City all roads lead to the Strip - the bedazzling 6.5km boulevard of casinos, hotels, restaurants and attractions. Strolling the Strip is a beguiling way to soak up the city sights. Have a mandatory flutter at one of the casinos, see a show (there are eight resident Cirque du Soleil acts and a revolving catalogue of headline performers), and hit one of Vegas's famous pool parties (the Golden Nugget has a waterslide that passes through an aquarium). \nView relics of old-school Vegas at the Neon Museum which is US$25 (NNZ$39) entry for adults, neonmuseum.org , enjoy panoramic vistas from the 350-metre-high Stratosphere tower (US$28 for adults, stratospherehotel.com ), and see the evening sound and light show at the Fremont Street Experience - a sprawling five-block pedestrian mall vegasexperience.com . \nEAT \nNo visitor goes hungry - or thirsty - in Las Vegas. The dining options are as vast as the neon tubing lining the glittering city streets; from takeaway chains and American diners to multicultural cuisine and top-shelf restaurants. Scarpetta at The Cosmopolitan is headed by New York chef Scott Conantâ€‹ and serves modern Italian dishes with views high over the Bellagio Fountains (mains from US$50, cosmopolitanlasvegas.com ). For a more relaxed bite, FIVE50 Pizza Bar at the Aria whips up a great range of inventive pizzas and share plates, with a selection of craft beers (pizzas from US$20, aria.com ). \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:13:18.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
