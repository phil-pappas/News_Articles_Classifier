There are now suggestions the pair not only survived the escape to live well into the 1970s, but they could still be alive today. \nAs recounted in the TV special, the photo was allegedly taken by the Anglins’ family friend Fred Brizzi, who claims to have run into the brothers in Rio de Janeiro in the ‘70s. Brizzi gave the photo to the Anglin family in 1992, but nephews Ken and David Widner only now handed it over to Art Roderick, the retired US marshal who was lead investigator on the case for 20 years. \n“When you work these types of cases, there’s a feeling you get when stuff starts to fall into place,” Roderick recently told The New York Post . “I’m getting this feeling now.” Authorities have long said no one ever escaped Alcartraz alive. Picture: Jenny Stevens Source: News Limited \nRoderick commissioned a forensic artist expert to analyse the photo, who concluded it was “highly likely” that the men in the photo are indeed John and Clarence Anglin. After looking into Brizzi’s own criminal background — as well as an alternate escape theory centred on a getaway boat — he now also suspects the Anglins’ childhood friend may have helped in their escape. \nThe new evidence was enough to spur Roderick to line up new interviews in the case and he is talking to the US Marshals Service about investigating in Brazil, where the brothers (who would be in their mid-80s if still alive) may have fled. \nHe ends the special by saying, “I truly believe we’re going to close it.” \nIn June 1962, the Anglin brothers and fellow inmate Frank Morris escaped through a hole they’d chiselled into the walls of Alcatraz prison and climbed up to the roof. \nTo mask their escape, they’d placed in their bunks realistic-looking dummy heads they’d made out of papier-mâché and human hair from the prison barber shop. They then grabbed makeshift paddles and plunged an escape raft they made from stolen raincoats into the dark waters of San Francisco Bay.

Source: Supplied \nAlcatraz officials have long insisted the men drowned, maintaining the prison’s bragging rights of no escapees. \nThe Anglin family are co-operating with authorities after withholding information from authorities for years because, they say, they were spied on and harassed by the FBI for years. But a desire to see the case solved before Marie Anglin Widner — the Winners’ mother and the escapees’ sister — passed away, combined with the cockiness of Alcatraz officials, inspired them to come forward. \nAmong the other evidence are Christmas cards, signed with Clarence and John Anglin’s names, that were delivered to their mother during the three years after the escape. They arrived without postage. \n“[Alcatraz officials] were not willing to ... say, ‘Maybe [the escapees] did make it’, ” David Widner says. “That gave me the motive to prove them wrong.” \nThe nephews hope the special rewrites the history of Alcatraz, and cements their uncles and Morris as the only people to successfully escape the island, out of the 36 who tried.
