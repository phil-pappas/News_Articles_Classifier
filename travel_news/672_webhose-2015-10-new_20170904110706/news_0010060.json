As corporate-owned farms evolve, Thompson has been working to make sure his family-owned farm, which grows cherries, apples, peaches, pears, and pumpkins, stays true to their small-town roots.\nDespite the early harvest making it challenging to stay profitable, Thompson’s Farms has kept its doors open to “If you’re not running 500 acres, you’re not farming,” said Thompson. “And so we had to change our direction, we went to Ag tourism. And ‘Ag tourism’ is what you see here today. These are people who are looking for a ‘true farm’ experience, and we’re more than happy to give it to them.”\nThompson says the younger generation isn’t familiar with Norman Rockwell, a 20th-entury American painter and illustrator who captured a unique vision of “Americana.” That vision, which portrays farms going back to their roots, where everything is home-made, is becoming more rare, says Thompson. It’s a vision he strives to “We don’t bring in any plastic stuff,” explains Thompson.\nThompson’s farm is open to the public every Saturday and Sunday in October. As part of the agricultural tourism experience, visitors can pick pumpkins, visit the maze, and go on a hayride.\nThe hourly pigs race and pumpkin cannon-firing is free to the public. There’s also no parking charge. Thompson’s farm is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends. “You can sit and do nothing,” said Thompson. “You can spend as little or as much as you want.” During week days, the farm is open only to school visits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:54:52.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
