He said the official launch of a hugely controversial document from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) had been delayed over the weekend. But Sir Richard, the British businessman who sits on the Global Commission on Drug Policy, announced in a blog that he had seen a copy of the document. The United Nations is understood to dispute Sir Richard's interpretation of the paper - but has not yet issued a formal statement. Sir Richard, the founder of Virgin, said: \"In an as-yet unreleased statement ... the UNODC, which has shaped much of global drug policy for decades, call on governments around the world to decriminalise drug use and possession for personal consumption for all drugs. \"This is a refreshing shift that could go a long way to finally end the needless criminalisation of millions of drug users around the world. \"My colleagues on the Global Commission on Drug Policy and I could not be more delighted. \"Together with countless other tireless advocates, I’ve for years argued that we should treat drug use as a health issue, not as a crime. \"While the vast majority of recreational drug users never experience any problems, people who struggle with drug addiction deserve access to treatment, not a prison cell.\" He added that the document had been set for release at the International Harm Reduction conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Sunday.

It would be unusual for such a significant UN policy change to be announced in this way. • Official report triggers Home Office row over decriminalisation of drugs The UN would normally take years to formulate such a policy and an announcement would be made by a senior UN figure. Sir Richard also announced the development on Twitter. . @unodc drug policy shift could end needless criminalisation of millions of drug users http://t.co/zoXmZKESRA pic.twitter.com/cfp6udxORA — Richard Branson (@richardbranson) October 19, 2015 Absolutely agree with this.
