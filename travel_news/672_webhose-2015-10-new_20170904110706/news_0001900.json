Steinmetz wants the global hotel industry to learn from Mr. Hernan Serna, front desk clerk of the ibis Medellin hotel, Colombia. eTN just added the hotel to THE LIST, a prestigious award by eTurboNews. \nHere is why: \nRecently, eTN Publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz attended the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) General Assembly in Medellin, Colombia. UNWTO, together with PRO EXPO Colombia, had arranged for a hotel room for 6 nights at the Ibis Medellin hotel. \neTN publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz said: “Upon a late midnight arrival after a long flight from Honolulu to Houston to Panama City onto Medellin, I was greeted with transportation organized by the Colombian Tourism Ministry and transported to the ibis Medellin hotel. \n“Even though I arrived after midnight when the sky was dark, the hotel appeared before me like a bright icon - brand new, very clean and pleasant, and close to the UNWTO Conference venue. \n“When I went to check in, no reservation was found and attempts to reach UNWTO or PROEXPO at such a late hour was impossible. \n“At first, the hotel appeared to be sold out, but a very pleasant Front Desk Manager, Mr. Hernan Sena, approached me and apologized. He said he would be able to accommodate me for the night free of charge, and we would sort everything out in the morning. \n“Not wanting to run the risk of not having a place to stay the following night, or for the rest of the conference for that matter, I asked him if he had 6 nights that he could book for me right then and there, and if so, how much would that be. Mr. Sena responded that he would be able to accommodate me somehow and would only charge around $50 a night. Happily and surprised the hotel would not take advantage of raising rates in a sold out situation, I agreed to pay this and gave him my credit card. \n“I was pleasantly surprised that for such a nominal rate, the room looked new and was well-equipped. After taking a shower and laying down for a half an hour to recuperate from the long flight, I went on my computer and was able to establish a chat with an UNWTO official. She found the reservation had been changed at the last minute and a room was booked at the Diez Hotel instead. After checking with that property, I found out that I was indeed booked at the Diez Hotel in Medellin. \n“I went back to the front desk to explain what had happened, and found Mr. Sena still working. He talked to his superior, then asked me for my credit card and immediately processed a full refund. He also went outside with me to make sure I got a safe taxi to take me to the other hotel. \n“This type of customer service was a wonderful experience, a great first impression on my trip to Colombia. It made me feel grateful and humbled just to be in Medellin. I applaud Mr. Sena for caring about his customers and Ibis Medellin hotel for its prompt cooperation to accommodate me in so many ways. \n“Mr. Sena was more concerned about my wellbeing than the short gain he could have garnered for his hotel. This is all so brilliant, because can you guess where I would choose to stay if I am traveling on my own accord and find myself in Medellin again? This type of action needs to be recognized with an excellent recommendation not only for Mr. Sena, but also the Ibis Medellin hotel as well, and for the Accor brand as a whole.” \nIt is because of this experience, that eTN is recognizing Mr. Sena to this prestigious group and adding the ibis Medellin hotel to THE LIST. \nSo how does one make it on THE LIST? Anyone can nominate a hotel, destination, attraction, airline, person, cruise, or restaurant based on a best moment or experience. THE LIST is not about rating how “luxurious” something is. It is more about how much something is appreciated or different. \nUpon hearing this story, Delfim Pinheiro, General Manager of the ibis Medellin hotel, said: “First, I want to thank you for your email where you expressed your satisfaction with the services received in our hotel Ibis Medellin during the last UNWTO General Assembly held in our city, especially for the service received by our receptionist and Mr. Hernan Serna which also I will share with all our staff as an example to follow.\" \n“We are pleased you saw one of our priorities is to train our employees so that from our policies, they can make decisions independently and streamline customer service. \n“As a brand that is part of Accor Hotels, we share the values of this hospitality group, which under the slogan, ‘Feel welcome,’ we aim to provide the necessary care to make our guests feel welcomed and especially warmly received by our partners, as we firmly believe that this is the rationale for the hotel industry in the world.” \nThe ibis Medellin hotel is located in a development known as Ciudad del Rio, close to the Medellin Museum of Modern Art (MAMM), 2 Medellin subway stations, the financial and industrial districts, shopping centers, clinics and bars, as well as restaurants and clubs. It is just 10 minutes from the city center and the Plaza Mayor Convention and Exhibition Center. \nThe property has 216 rooms, a restaurant, and a bar that make the ibis Medellin a strategically-located hotel at the heart of a thriving neighborhood with incredible views and a relaxing atmosphere. It is a unique 3-star hotel in the city, and it is 100% nonsmoking. \nThe rooms are designed in a standard layout, and each room has a television with a remote control, safe, hangers, extra pillows, and a private bathroom. Each style of room is functional and comfortable, perfect for working or relaxing, and has everything guests need: bed duvets, a big desk and telephone, high-speed Wi-Fi Internet, TV with all the best channels, a nice bathroom with a shower and hair dryer, air conditioning, operator or automatic wake-up calls, and 110/120 V AC and an RJ 11 outlet. Bed options include a room with 1 double bed, a room with 2 single twin beds, or a room with 1 double bed and 1 folding bed that would be suitable for families traveling with a child that is up to 11 years of age.
