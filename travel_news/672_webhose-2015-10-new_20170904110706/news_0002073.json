Kirk. (Star Trek: The Cruise)\nIt’s a bittersweet realization that the first official Star Trek: The Cruise has already sold out in less than two month’s time – clearly achieved at warp 9 speed. (Let’s be honest. I really wanted to go on this one)! The silver lining, however, is that a single cabin remains on the January 2017 sailing, and you can now enter a contest to win it.\nDeveloped by Entertainment Cruise Productions under license by CBS Consumer Products, the Trekker-friendly cruise will transform Norwegian Cruise Line’s Norwegian Pearl into an immersive Star Trek environment populated by crew dressed in uniforms from the sci-fi franchise and featuring cast members led by none other than cruise host William Shatner, or Captain James T. Kirk.\nIn celebration of Star Trek’s 50th anniversary, the cruise will have every venue of the ship referencing pivotal Star Trek haunts and destinations, and some locations from the franchise will even be recreated onboard. Special events will focus on its film and TV characters and social, technological and scientific impact; and parties and gaming competitions will be inspired by its history.\nInteractively headlining will be fan favorites Marina Sirtis, Jonathan Frakes, Robert Picardo, John de Lancie, James Darren, Denise Crosby, Steven Rankin, Vaughn Armstrong, Casey Biggs and recently added Terry Farrell. (Unfortunately absent from the list is Brent Spiner who played Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation and cruise director Gil Godwyn in the comedy film Out to Sea, who would be an absolute perfect fit). Although, there are more participants yet to be announced in the coming months, and maybe he will be a surprise addition. Fingers crossed.\nWhat’s more, the six-day cruise will set sail from Jan. 9-15, 2017 from Miami, Florida to Cozumel, Mexico; Nassau, Bahamas and Norwegian Cruise Line’s own private island, Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas.\nFor more information on Star Trek: The Cruise and to enter for a chance to win the sailing’s last cabin, visit www.StarTrekTheCruise.com . The winner will be announced on Oct. 1, 2016.\nMore from TravelPulse:\nHave a Great Love Story?
