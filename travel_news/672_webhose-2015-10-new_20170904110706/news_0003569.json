Vineyards line the approach to the lodge -- and you'll be greeted with a glass of Bernardus wine as you check in. \nGlittering chandeliers light the open and airy lobby, which has courtyard, croquet and bocce lawn views. Take time to walk around the lush organic kitchen gardens, pick up a game of bocce, or lounge poolside, where the water is a constant 80 degrees. At night, the grounds are aglow with fire pits. And a dip in the hot tub makes for a relaxing evening. One of the newly renovated lodge guest rooms at the Bernardus Lodge & Spa in Carmel Valley. (Bernardus Lodge & Spa) Rooms: The 57 refurbished rooms are decorated in a soothing, earth-toned palette, with French oak floors, a velvet sofa, flat-screen TV, fireplace and patio with croquet lawn, pool or mountain views. Everything in the mini fridge, which is stocked with juice and beer, and the in-room snacks, coffee and half bottle of Bernardus wine are complimentary. Or rather, they're included in your room rate and $30 resort fee. Zzzz's: Sink into a plush king featherbed mattress, piled high with fluffy pillows and goose-down comforter, covered in soft white Italian linens. \nSplashes: The all-white marble bathrooms include a deep soaking tub, big enough for two, separate shower with rain water shower head, and heated floors. Advertisement \nExtras: Guests can \"test drive\" a new model Mercedes-Benz for four hours, or head to the remodeled spa for pampering. When hunger strikes, make dinner reservations at Lucia Restaurant, or nosh elevated pub food and sip craft cocktails from the sleek new bar. Details: Rates from $515. A $30 resort fee covers use of eucalyptus steam room, sauna, pools, 24-hour fitness center and tennis courts. 415 W.
