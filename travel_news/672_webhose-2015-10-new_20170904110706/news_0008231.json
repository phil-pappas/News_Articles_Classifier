The flights will operate three times a week – Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday – with Boeing 777-200LRs. Flying time for the new San Francisco-Delhi flights will be 16 hours and 5 minutes – a full 3½ hours faster than any other airline.\nFor passengers traveling beyond Delhi to India’s technology or commercial centers, Air India offers fast connecting service to Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, and Mumbai, as well as to other major tourist destinations across India.\nThe non-stop flights depart San Francisco at 10:00 am, and arrive in Delhi at 3:35 pm the next day. Departures from Delhi are at 2:45 am, and the arrival time in San Francisco is 6:00 am the same day.\nLike Air India’s non-stop service from New York, Newark, and Chicago, the San Francisco-Delhi flights will feature First, Executive, and Economy Class and a choice of Continental or Indian cuisine served in the gracious style that is distinctly Indian.\n“The continuing expansion of technology and other business partnerships between the U.S. and India provides us with a very solid basis for starting service from San Francisco. We are also looking forward to serving the sizeable leisure travel market and Indo-American communities on the west coast,” said Air India’s Regional Manager, Americas, Ms. Vandana Sharma. She added, “With our state-of-the-art Delhi hub and seamless connecting service to India’s main businesses and tourism centers and other major cities, Air India is well positioned to serve all of those markets.”\nFor details on Air India’s new San Francisco-Delhi service, special introductory fares, and reservations, contact your local Air India sales office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:41:42.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
