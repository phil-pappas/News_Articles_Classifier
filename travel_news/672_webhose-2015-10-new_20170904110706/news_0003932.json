Perhaps more than we have seen at tournaments of the past. But it's the nature of the game. You're going to succumb to injuries. As far as Ireland are concerned, they could hardly have lost more key players than they did. It really took its toll on the team, not just in terms of the skills they were missing on the field but also leadership. Paul O'Connell and Johnny Sexton were a massive loss. I don't need to say that Sexton was sorely missed, but he would have made a big difference. He's one of the best No 10s in the world. When Ireland were down 14 or 17 points at the beginning they started making mistakes you'd never usually see them make. It's almost like they were trying too hard. They were forcing the ball because they were so desperate to get on the scoresheet. When you're within range, you don't panic. You know you can catch up with them. But when there's a big deficit it definitely affects the way you play. Cian will want some 'me time'. He'll spend that with his immediate family Cian Healy and the boys will have gone back to the bosom of the family after the debrief within the camp. I know from my own experience, from defeat in rugby and in mixed martial arts, family and your close friends are the people you want to be around, especially when you've been on the world stage like these guys are. There's so many critics and so many people talking about it and nitpicking. Everyone wants to talk about it and it's hard for you to get away from it. Your friends and family will never judge or critique. They'll just be there for them, to support them. They'll take comfort from each other as well. They're a tight squad of players . I'm in fight week myself this week for UFC Dublin, and it's a long, drawn-out process and there's a lot of people wanting your time, from media, to fans to sponsors. You're happy to do that. But when it's over, you just want a long break from that. These guys have had a much longer period than I would for fight week. I'm sure Cian will want to take a break from that. He'll want some \"me time\". He'll spend that with his immediate family. All the squad will have been sharing a hotel room with another member of the squad. He'll want some time alone and I completely understand that. Game-changer: Luke Fitzgerald takes it to Argentina Photo: Getty All the rest of the guys from our school rugby team are coming to the UFC event in Dublin, so I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up going. But, at the same time, I wouldn't be surprised if Cian doesn't. It is a period almost of grieving when you have suffered a significant defeat. I know it was a devastating loss and all those guys will be devastated. They might not want to be out and about in public. Some of them might just want to keep themselves to themselves. They've been in the spotlight over there for a long time and everyone is looking at them. They might just want to get away from all that. Just a word on Luke Fitzgerald , who was like super-sub for Ireland against Argentina. Luke was one of the best players I ever played against. He was a phenom. He broke into the Irish team straight after school and had only just turned 19. That following year he made the Lions tour at age 20. He started a test game and everything. He showed such promise at the start of his career. Then he had an awful run of injuries over the next couple of years and he lost some momentum in his career. But he's come back strong in the last year and it was great to see him come on and show that promise again . Luke has always been a game-changing player whenever the ball is in his hands Having played against him in all the age-groups, Luke was a game-changing player whenever the ball was in his hands. You'd worry whenever he got the ball because he had that potential to be able to sidestep someone and just break that line. He was in the same year as me and Cian Healy so we played against him pretty much every year. He was Blackrock and we were Belvedere. We met Blackrock in the semi-final of the Junior Schools Cup, when we were 15. We drew with them and he scored in that match. We replayed them and they beat us. When myself and Cian were in the fifth year we made the senior team and he made the senior team as well. He'd actually won the Senior Cup the year before when he was only 16. In the fifth year Ian Madigan and him were on the team and so were me and Cian in ours. We played Blackrock in the final and we beat them. Then, in the final year at school, me and Cian played against Blackrock in the semi-final against Luke and Ian Madigan and they beat us. We had a good back and forth with them. They were our biggest rivals at school. They are days you never forget. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:48:15.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
