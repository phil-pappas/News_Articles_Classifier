Photo via fb.com \nGrand Rapids Civic Theatre is getting into the Halloween spirit with a production of a favorite Halloween-time tale — with a modern-day musical twist. \nThe theater, or GRCT, will present “Sleepy Hollow: A Musical Tale” from Oct. 23-Nov. 1. \nThe Washington Irving classic has been updated with a “musical twist.” \nAllyson Paris, GRCT associate director, described the music as “outstanding” and said the production is filled with “modern pop-themed songs.” \nThe production \nThis updated spin begins in the present day on Halloween night as three children find themselves thrust into the mysterious village of Sleepy Hollow, in colonial New England. \nThe children encounter a slew of colorful characters and have a confrontation with the infamous \"Headless Horseman\" himself. \nAs the children sing and dance their way through the world of the 18th century, they find the origins for traditions that are celebrated today as they unveil the haunting allure of the legend of Sleepy Hollow. \n“Our cast has approached this show as a blend between a Tim Burton film and a 'Scooby-Doo' episode,” Paris said. \nChildren welcome \nThe production is recommended for children ages seven and up. \nChildren attending the Oct. 31 matinee showing at 2 p.m. are encouraged to dress in their Halloween costumes. GRCT said the first 200 children will receive special Halloween treats. \nTickets Charlsie Dewey Charlsie Dewey is a Grand Rapids Business Journal staff reporter who covers law, health care, manufacturing, travel and tourism, marketing, PR and advertising, sustainability and arts and entertainment.
