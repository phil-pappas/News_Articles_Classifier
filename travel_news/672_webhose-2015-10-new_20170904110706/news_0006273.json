August was the 21st consecutive month that full-time equivalent (FTE) employment for US scheduled passenger airlines exceeded the same month of the previous year and the highest monthly total since September 2008. \nMonth-to-month, the number of FTEs rose 0.1 percent from July to August, rising after one monthly decline. Scheduled passenger airline categories include network, low-cost, regional and other airlines. \nThe four network airlines that collectively employ two-thirds of the scheduled passenger airline FTEs reported 3.7 percent more FTEs in August 2015 than in August 2014. Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines increased FTEs from August 2014 while United Airlines reduced FTEs. American Airlines reported 6.1 percent more FTEs in August than American and US Airways reported separately in August 2014. July 2015 was the first month for which the two merged airlines submitted a combined report. Month-to-month, the number of network airline FTEs was unchanged from July to August for the second consecutive month. Network airlines operate a significant portion of their flights using at least one hub where connections are made for flights to down-line destinations or spoke cities. \nThe six low-cost carriers reported 5.8 percent more FTEs in August 2015 than in August 2014. Spirit Airlines, Allegiant Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Virgin America and Southwest Airlines reported increases while Frontier Airlines reduced FTEs. Month-to-month, the number of low-cost airline FTEs rose 0.7 percent from July to August, rising for the fifth consecutive month. Low-cost airlines operate under a low-cost business model, with infrastructure and aircraft operating costs below the overall industry average. \nThe 12 regional carriers reported 2.7 percent fewer FTEs in August 2015 than in August 2014. Seven regional airlines – PSA Airlines, Compass Airlines, Mesa Airlines, Horizon Air, GoJet Airlines, Republic Airlines and SkyWest Airlines – reported increased employment levels. The others reported decreases. Month-to-month, the number of regional airline FTEs declined 0.2 percent from July to August, the third consecutive monthly decrease. Regional carriers typically provide service from small cities, using primarily regional jets to support the network carriers’ hub and spoke systems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:05:26.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
