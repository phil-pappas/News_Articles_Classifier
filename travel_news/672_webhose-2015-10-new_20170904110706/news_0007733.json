Domestic tourism is growing steadily and international visitor arrivals recently surpassed 3 million a year. Importantly, there’s been strong double digit growth in spend by those visitors,” Tourism Industry Association New Zealand (TIA) Chief Executive Chris Roberts says.\n“But with growth come pressures. How can we successfully host thousands more visitors, spread them around the country and make sure they don’t all want to come in summer? How can we protect our natural environment and keep the goodwill of Kiwis? Where will the infrastructure investment come from? Can we attract the right staff? And how can we ensure we consistently deliver world class visitor experiences?”\nThe Summit will delve into these and other hot tourism issues and opportunities, as well as reporting progress against the Tourism 2025 aspirational goal of growing total tourism revenue to $41 billion over the next decade.\nThe programme features a stimulating mix of speakers, including British transformational change expert Roger Flynn, whose experience includes British Airways, BBC and Virgin, where he worked directly with Sir Richard Branson.\nThe TIA National Tourism Summit Premier Partner is Wellington Airport. The Summit is also supported by ServiceIQ, Lincoln University, Westpac, Smartpay and InterContinental Wellington.\nSource:- TIANZ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:09:29.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
