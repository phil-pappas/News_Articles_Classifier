The guide is intended for residents and the thousands of visitors who flock to this seaside pearl. \nUK , 7 October 2015 -- \nWhitstable, the Grande Depart for a new Food Trail being blazed across East Kent \nWonderfulWhitstable.com has just launched, and is the first in a series that is intended to explore East Kent . The journey starts in Whitstable, which it suggests is the obvious kicking off point, being a convenient distance from London or from France via the Eurotunnel . This region of Kent is rapidly establishing itself as a food lover’s destination, much in the way of the Tapas Trail or the Pintxos Trail (to give it its proper name) does for the Northern Territory in Spain. With seaside regeneration now spreading along the coast to Ramsgate, along the way just brushing the Turner Gallery which is the spearhead of Margate’s attempt to reverse it’s fortunes. The website is a companion to The Wonderful Kitchens of Whitstable, a printed pocket size restaurant map to the town, for use by visitors and residents alike. Whitstable is already firmly established as a culinary pearl. Renowned worldwide for the annual Oyster festival and of course Wheelers Oyster Bar which next year celebrates 160 years in business. Whitstable’s regeneration started about 15 years ago, when it pulled itself out of its sleepy past and began the slow climb to become oneof the ‘must see’ destinations for tourists from around the world. The culinary delights on offer coupled with a thriving art scene provide a mouth-watering selection of restaurants and galleries sprinkled throughout the town. A trip to Whitstable isn’t just for foodies. A unique High Street celebrated for the lack of chain stores which in their place offers a unique collection of independent shops including unbelievably, butchers, bakers and greengrocers. A new comer to Whitstable that is making the most of the town’s cultural heritage is the recently established Whitstable Literary Festival which continues to grow each year featuring local authors alongside some of the internationally renowned stars of the literary world. As icing on the cake the Whitstable Biennale is a festival of new visual art, performance, film and sound, taking place every two years on the Kent coast. The event has grown out of Whitstable’s extensive artistic community, and has developed an international reputation for showcasing the most exciting up-and-coming artists, and engaging audiences in a rich programme. The website provides a unique introduction to the town, exploring the Independent shops, cafes, bars and restaurants. Featured on WonderfulWhitstable.com is the artisan chef Mark Stubbs of Wheelers fame and Ben Mathers a furniture designer of note. In videos on the site Mark gives us a little insight to his culinary skills and Ben talks about design and craftsmanship. Wonderfulwhitstable.com is both a celebration and a guide to your Grand Depart for exploring the East Kent Coast before heading off to graze in pastures new in Herne Bay, Margate, Broadstairs and Ramsgate. The website and guide are the brainchild of Martin McLoughlin. Martin is an international award winning graphic designer who has worked with some of the top agencies in London and New York and now lives in Whitstable . # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:25:31.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
