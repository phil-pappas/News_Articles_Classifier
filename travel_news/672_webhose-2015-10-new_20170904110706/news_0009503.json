Daniel Cessna , P. E., elected officials and community members in celebrating the opening today of the new Hulton Bridge in Oakmont , Allegheny County .\n\"Today's opening represents another step forward for the region's mobility,\" Gov. Wolf said. \"Investing in our roads and bridges sets the stage for economic growth, and we are fortunate to have resources to deliver such improvements.\"\nThe $65.7 million Hulton Bridge replacement project over the Allegheny River began in September 2013 . The new structure is approximately 1,600 feet long and 69 feet wide and will carry two 11-foot lanes of traffic in each direction with a six-foot shoulder.\n\"We worked hard to minimize disruption during this project and the new bridge meets the needs of motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists,\" Cessna said. \"It is with great pride that our PennDOT team opens this bridge as a vital transportation link in our region.\"\nAdditionally, the project included the reconstruction of approximately 1,300 feet of Freeport Road in Harmar Township and 550 feet of Hulton Road in Oakmont Borough . Dual left turn lanes will be implemented on the western end of the project for southbound Freeport Road traffic to access the bridge. Eastbound bridge traffic will use two lanes to Allegheny Avenue.\nImprovements such as wider shoulders for safe bicycle travel and an improved walkway for pedestrians enhance the enjoyment of the Allegheny River view.\n\"For more than a century the Hulton Bridge has been a vital link in the Allegheny Valley,\" said Rep. Frank Dermody , an Oakmont resident. \"The new bridge means greater safety, smoother traffic flow and a better quality of life for thousands of people in the valley.\"\nThe existing structurally deficient bridge was built in 1908. It will be demolished in 2016. Gannett Fleming designed the new bridge, while Brayman Construction Corporation is the prime contractor.
