She gestures fruitlessly with the knob of her walking stick, resisting the temptation to poke it in Gregson’s direction. “Sorry Madam” Gregson says, muttering something inaudible in Kisawahili under his breath. Mrs Blake is off to the shops. An outing for which she must steel herself – and the fact that it is rainy season makes life even more challenging. Normally she would send Sandra the maid to do the shopping with Gregson, though they have a habit of disappearing for hours and today Mrs Blake would like to check her post office box and send a letter to her friend Mary on the coast. Dressed in a Liberty print shirt, string of pearls, sensible A-line denim skirt and flat pumps from Bata, she is ready for anything. Pulling into the parade of local shops, a dowdy collection of long low buildings and cottages that date from the 1930s, the car makes its way gingerly over an undulating surface, worn into waves from decades of traffic. Mrs Blake is off to the shops, an outing for which she must steel herself . She plans to check her post office box and send a letter to her friend Mary on the coast Photo: Alamy The chaos around the small provision store is worse than usual. Right opposite the post office, a new shopping centre is being built on a piece of land the size of a postage stamp. Unharnessed workers without so much as a hard hat between them, send buckets flying precariously up ropes to the third and fourth storey and the sound of the cement mixer is deafening. Unperturbed by the noise, the regular parade of hawkers and beggars descend on Mrs Blake’s car as Gregson pulls into a narrow parking space. Mrs Blake shuffles along the seat and attempts to get out. The hawkers are wielding fire extinguishers, windscreen wipers, bags of fruit and pairs of second hand shoes and boots, forming a human barrier to block her exit. \"Just your size Madam,\" a young man says. \"The ones you said you were looking for.\" \"Nonsense,\" Mrs Blake says, refusing to fall for his ploy. Mrs Blake calls for Gregson to bat the hawkers away before she proceeds to alight and pick her way around puddles and past the poorly dressed small child who is asking anyone who will listen for sponsorship for school fees. 'Shop assistants greet her like a long lost relative, relieving her of her baskets and pulling out a wobbly shopping trolley, with which to follow her dutifully around' A smiling chap who hops along with a long stick in place of a withered right leg selling handmade greetings cards, hangs back. He knows Mrs Blake is never free with her money so saves his breath. A less experienced young woman offers the old lady bunch of fresh lilies. \"Only 300 hundred for a bunch,\" the woman ventures. \"That much?\" Mrs Blake retorts. \"It’s daylight robbery!\" On entering the shop, Mrs Blake breathes a sigh of relief. She has run the gauntlet and arrived. Shop stewards greet her like a long lost relative, relieving her of her baskets and pulling out a wobbly shopping trolley, with which to follow her dutifully around as she makes her random selection of goods from the shelves. Mr Patel the elder waves a piece of paper in Mrs Blake’s direction from the raised glass booth where he sits cooking up numbers. A gesture that she studiously ignores since he’s been after her to settle her outstanding credit for months. She'll phone Gregson when it's time for him to drive her home in the Peugeot 504 Photo: Alamy Gregson arrives with the shopping list that Mrs Blake left in the car and together with the shop assistants, they make a kind of stately procession along the aisles. Suitable vegetables are selected under the micromanagement of Gregson, as Mrs Blake heads on up to the butcher’s counter and then on to the dog biscuits. A newly coiffed and manicured fortysomething woman, fresh from the salon upstairs, is holding forth at the checkout. \"Can someone help me? I really can’t be expected to unload my shopping onto the counter when I’ve just had my nails done!\" An unexpected downpour as Mrs Blake is about to leave the shop sparks a scramble for umbrellas. Once the post office errand is done, Mrs Blake heads over to the shinier, new shopping centre complex where a supermarket selling identical things notably does not extend credit to Kenya expat old-timers. Thank goodness for the comparative luxury of the Cafe des Arts at the end of it all, where a frappucino latte and the cosy company of her friend Beryl beckons. She will have all the gossip from the Haycock funeral and together they will set the world to rights. At the end of it all, Mrs Blake will call Gregson from her mobile phone and he will be waiting outside the café to sweep her home for lunch.
