Finally, enjoy dawn with the dead, as you become the only living person ever to wake up in the Paris catacombs,” reads the listing.\nTown hall sources said Monday the California-based Airbnb paid up to 350,000 euros (AUD$540,000) to privatise the tunnels.\nCould you sleep with millions of bones surrounding you?

It has already been rented out to film crews and for fashion shows.\nThe creepiest accommodation on offer.
