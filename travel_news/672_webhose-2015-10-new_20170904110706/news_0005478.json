Photographer's Note \n Arica - Made in France  The San Marcos Cathedral in Arica may perhaps look like a picturesque old church but it has a rather unusual history. The French engineer Gustave Eiffel , known for the famous tower in Paris and for different renowned bridges, has also designed a church. This all-metal prefabricated building has been manufactured in France and was afterwards shipped in pieces to South America to be assembled on site. In 1868 when Arica still belonged to Peru the original San Marcos Church was destroyed by an earthquake and a subsequent gigantic tsunami. The Peruvian president, José Balta y Montero, commissioned Gustave Eiffel to built the new cathedral on exactly the same place. The inauguration was in 1876 (still in Peru) and in 1984 it became a National Monument (in Chile). In Arica theres a second prefabricated building designed by Eiffel: the Aduana de Arica (Arica's Customs Office). \njemaflor has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:22:09.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
