In light of this, it’s hardly surprising that it is the most popular tourist city in the world. Millions of visitors every year are attracted to the city to immerse in the culture, cuisine, architecture and shopping. In Paris, however, as in any city, there are a few things to remember if you want to make sure you get the absolute most out of your stay.Don’t Rush ItWhile it’s entirely possible to have a fantastic time with only a day or two to spend in the city, it’s a fool’s errand to try to see it all. One or two night breaks in Paris are popular, and it’s all too common for eager travellers to turn what could be a marvellous snapshot of the city into a stressful, soulless whistle-stop tour of every overcrowded site of postcard fodder they can reach. Visitors only staying for a few days would be better advised to take things at their own pace and enjoy a smaller slice of the city in greater depth. If it’s the cuisine you’re interested in, for example, read up on a few good restaurants and spend your time and money on those. If you’ve always wanted to spend a day or two blowing the budget shopping in Paris, find a couple of good shopping streets and concentrate your efforts there - save the rest for another visit.Do What You WantYou know how it is: you friends you’re headed somewhere on holiday and they talk your ear off with recommendations and things you simply 'must' do. If their suggestions appeal, then you’ll find them a great starting point, but if they don’t, you shouldn't feel you have to see or do anything simply because it’s the 'done' thing. If you have zero interest in architecture or panoramic views, don’t bother with the Eiffel Tower, for instance, and if you hate shopping at home, don’t spend a miserable day shopping in Paris! Nobody knows what you like to do on holiday better than you do – and it's your holiday, after all.Dodge the CrowdsAs the world’s number one tourist city, Paris’ more popular tourist spots can get very, very crowded. If you don’t want to spend half your holiday queuing, try to avoid the crowds. Probably the easiest way to do this is to travel outside of school holidays, and to avoid the summer entirely. If you do travel during summer, consider avoiding the most popular tourist spots and save those for another visit instead.Being aware of the pitfalls will make your time in this amazing city even more unforgettable. Wander the historic streets, gaze at the beautiful buildings, enjoy the food, and take advantage of the amazing shopping. In Paris, there’s plenty to do, and if you go at your own pace and do exactly what you feel like doing, you can't help but have a wonderful time.   \nLukas Johannes is a driver for Shuttle Direct.
