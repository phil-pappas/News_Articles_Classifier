Below are additional key findings from this year’s holiday travel survey: Eighty-six percent of Americans plan to stay at a hotel over the holidays and 66 percent plan to take flights. 71 percent of survey respondents would rather stay at a hotel than with family with the number one reason being that staying at a hotel is less stressful. 33 percent of Americans listed long airport lines as something they are dreading this year, compared to just 13 percent in 2014. Vacation packages are hot this year - 34 percent of respondents have already booked a holiday vacation package rather than booking travel products separately. Sixty-four percent of Americans plan to spend more on holiday travel-related expenses than gifts, perhaps in a nod to quality time over material items. \nTerms and Conditions 1 The Orbitz holiday survey was fielded by Orbitz from Sept. 21 – 23, 2015 via HawkPartners. 800 U.S. adults aged 18 and older who had who planned to travel over the holiday were surveyed. 2 FEELGOOD: Book a qualifying hotel between Oct. 5, 2015 12:01AM CT and Nov. 29, 2015 11:59PM CT, for 2 or more nights for travel between October 5, 2015, and March 31, 2016, via Orbitz and instantly receive 15% off through the use of the promotion code up to a maximum savings of $150 per booking.
