His solution was a glass-fronted collection of hexagon-shaped spaces surrounding a brick chimney. \nNicknamed \"Honeycomb House,\" it was Wright's first design based on non-rectangular forms. The house that the Hannas thought would cost $15,000 ended up with a price tag of $37,000. While the house is generally considered to be one of Wright's Usonian designs, intended for middle-income families, subsequent additions pushed its eventual size and cost far beyond the means of \"Middle America.\" Hanna House is recognized by the American Institute of Architects as one of seventeen Wright buildings that best represent his contribution to American culture. \nThe house is made of redwood and brick, with a concrete slab floor. It has four bedrooms, three bathrooms, kitchen and a living area charmingly described on the drawings as \"sanctum.\" Also on the property are a guest house, hobby shop, garage and carport, as well as now-dry water features. \nThe house was the Hanna family home until 1975 when it was donated to Stanford University. It served as the provost's home until the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake severely damaged it and subsequently closed for almost a decade for a seismic retrofit. \nIf you want to know more about Usonian architecture, try this - or read Frank Lloyd Wright's Usonian Houses by Carla Lind. \n737 Frenchman's RoadStanford, CA (about 30 miles south of San Francisco off I-280) Tours are available by reservation only Photo Credit: Â©2001 Betsy Malloy Photography.
