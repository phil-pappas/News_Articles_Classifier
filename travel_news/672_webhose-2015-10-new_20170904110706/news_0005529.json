Delta, the third-largest American airline, said its capacity — or total mileage flown by its planes’ seats — would grow zero to 2 percent next year, compared with a nearly 3 percent rise this year. Wall Street analysts, noting stagnant foreign demand for United States carriers, have pushed them to shrink international service so fewer discount fares are necessary to sell out flights. For the fourth quarter, the airline said it would keep capacity flat compared with a year earlier to slow the decline in passenger revenue per available seat mile to between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent. That gauge fell 4.9 percent in the third quarter. Net income was $1.32 billion with an operating profit margin of 21 percent.
