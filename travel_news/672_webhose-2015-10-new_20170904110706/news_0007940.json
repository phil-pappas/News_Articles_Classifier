Wow \nThe most exciting destination in the world right now is Nihiwatu on Sumba island in Indonesia. Originally, this was a paradise for well-heeled surfers, but Nihiwatu has undergone a transformation thanks to American entrepreneur Chris Burch. \nHe’s kept with Sumbanese tradition to create a super luxury, eco-friendly resort, with pristine beaches and remote Indonesian jungles. A truly beautiful destination whose slogan is “on the edge of wildness.” \nJapan is the best country for Asia first-timers. As a westerner I’d never felt so foreign, yet so welcome, in Asia. And despite knowing none of the language, I felt at home within a day. \nThe country has the perfect mix of fast-paced city life and relaxing nature-filled countryside, with fantastic (and healthy!) cuisine, progressive technology and a wonderful respect for ancient traditions. Sexy snaps \nThe most underrated destination in the world has to be Malta. The island nation is home to some of the world’s most prehistoric settlements, beautiful coastlines and electric blue waters. Malta is a culture junkie’s paradise and still largely unknown to the global traveller. \nThe famous Blue Lagoon, Azure Window, island of Comino and “silent city” of Mdina are must-sees. \nAlso, Hollywood has filmed there for over 15 years, with the island playing host to the sets of Game of Thrones , Troy , Captain Phillips , World War Z , The Da Vinci Code , Munich and Gladiator . \nThe one place in America I am still dying to visit is Austin, Texas. I’m a tech guy that loves food and music so SXSW is high on my bucket list of things to do. Austin has tech, BBQ and Texan charm, who could ask for more? A second spot is Big Sur, California. Living in New York, I definitely do not see enough of nature and Californian national parks are about as good as they get. \nBritish Airways — as always — is the one airline that truly gets it right. Sure, they could do with in-flight Wi-Fi, but their new 787-9 Dreamliner is kitted out with loads of new tech and amazing in-flight entertainment. And the first class looks unreal. When in Greece \nMy idea of a perfectly packed carry-on would be filled with tech and ready for the beach. You’d find Bose QuietComfort Headphones, an iPhone 6+, a spare hard drive and Mophie juice pack, a Skyroam hotspot for global Wi-Fi, an Amazon Kindle, Ray-Ban aviators, Orlebar Brown Springer swim shorts, Rivieras cotton mesh beach shoes, and a Sunspel loopback sweat top or tee. Practical yet stylish! Awesome \nHvar, Croatia, is once place I can revisit time and time again. I love the Dalmatian coast. Although Split and Dubrovnik are stunningly beautiful, Hvar will always be a go-to place for me, with its rustic hillside houses, gorgeous harbour and calm waters. \nThe night-life is fantastic, with super yachts parked up outside Carpe Diem Beach club and perfect sundowners at the Hula Hula Beach Bar. \nAmanzoe in Porto Helli, Greece, is ideal for families. Set on the Peloponnese coast, this Aman resort offers stunning pavilions and large private villas with private chefs, drivers and all you will need for a luxury holiday. Plus it’s close to the islands of Spetses, Hydra and Poros, there’s a private beach and the amazing UNESCO World Heritage Site, Epidaurus, is just a short drive away. \nI’d love to spend a naughty weekend in … Punta del Este, Uruguay. This supercool spot in the heart of South America is the kind of place folks visit to let their hair down. With Brazil and Argentina having already been “done” so much, I think this would be a great weekend visit. And though it’s a bit far out, I might stay at Estancia Vik in the hamlet of Jose Igancio. \nFor me, Los Angeles has really emerged as an exciting business capital. Sure, it’s traditionally been the home of Hollywood and little else, but LA is now a thriving hub for tech and venture capital with a load of great companies basing themselves in “Silicon Beach”. \nWith the perfect climate and proximity to San Francisco, the city is now an amazing place to work, build a big business and enjoy the Californian lifestyle it’s so famous for.
