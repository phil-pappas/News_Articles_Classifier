Related Content \nAccording to a UPI.com post, Chinese airline Kunming is investigating allegations that female flight attendants were forced into overhead compartments as part of an industry hazing ritual. \nPhotos surfaced on popular app WeChat that showed the flight attendants for the airline in the bins. \nSome of the workers reported feeling bullied into completing the ritual, according the UPI post. \nThe WeChat post claims Kunming has long known about the ritual, according to the Washington Post. \nChina holds female flight attendants to strict height and weight standards, reports the Post, with some airlines requiring their attendants to be no older than 24, or even requiring them to master kung fu.
