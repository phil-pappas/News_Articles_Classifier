Source: AFP \nSince taking over from his father, Kim has pushed through a number of costly “leisure” projects that range in scale and ambition from theme parks to a swanky equestrian centre and ski resort. \nThis in a country where, according to the United Nations, 70 per cent of the population remains “food insecure” and cash-starved infrastructure leaves millions vulnerable to floods and drought.
