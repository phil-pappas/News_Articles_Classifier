Meadows shared. “Our number one priority is to offer outstanding guest experiences, and we’re extremely grateful for our incredibly talented culinary teams to be celebrated.”\nThe 2015 Good Taste Award is the third honor that Seabourn has received from Saveur in the past three years, having been named “Best Culinary Cruise Line” in the magazine’s Culinary Travel Awards in 2013 and 2014.\nExceptional cuisine runs deep in Seabourn’s DNA, and the line has a long-term commitment to fine dining. The line presents a number of culinary offerings beyond its award-winning restaurants, including appearances by guest chefs and the innovative “Shopping with the Chef” program. Seabourn recently began dedicated Food & Wine specialty cruises, such as the upcoming 14-Day Taste of Asia Food & Wine Cruise set to depart Hong Kong on January 3, 2016, bound for Singapore, stopping in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand along the way.\nThe Good Taste Award arrives at a transformative moment as Seabourn recently announced a partnership with world-renowned American Chef Thomas Keller, the Michelin-starred culinary leader behind Per Se, The French Laundry and Bouchon. The intimate, all-suite cruise line will soon begin serving menus from Keller on board all three ships, Seabourn Odyssey, Seabourn Quest and Seabourn Sojourn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:14:58.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
