The company guarantees a 400 percent ROI on their services. No one in our industry offers this. We recommend Digital Alchemy to the fullest.” Preferred Hotels & Resorts properties use Digital Alchemy for personalized email communications that include custom confirmations and pre-stay property marketing information on dining, event, amenity, and special offers. Properties within the brand’s member portfolio also rely on Digital Alchemy’s post-stay eSurveys that help hotel operators learn the most valuable areas of property operations to invest development resources. “A stay at The Joule Hotel is about having a genuine, unique experience for the discerning hotel guest. Digital Alchemy provides us with a direct link in reaching our guests before and after their stay so that we may better serve their individual needs,” said Kristin Assad, director of rooms at The Joule Hotel, a Preferred Hotels & Resorts property. “With comment card information we learn more about our guests and what is important to them when they stay with us. This provides us with an opportunity to make suggestions for upcoming visits. With so many different areas to explore at The Joule from retail to spa to food and drink, there is something for every guest. Having the Digital Alchemy tool to offer suggestions to our guests provides an opportunity to inform them about the many exceptional amenities of the hotel prior to arrival or simply a reminder of why they should return.” “Digital Alchemy maintains the high standards that Preferred Hotels & Resorts operators require. Our custom email marketing and mobile messaging services are on one integrated platform designed for instant guest response,” said Shannon Bedard, Digital Alchemy vice president. “Our messaging is attractive, personalized, and automated to deliver instant service which enables hotel staff to attend to guest needs.” Digital Alchemy produces and supports 100% of its clients’ email design and production requirements in-house based on an in-depth understanding of each customer’s operational requirements. “Many Preferred Hotels & Resorts properties use Digital Alchemy’s iNeed mobile concierge solution for fast, personal service on property,” said Osgood. “Guests use iNeed on their mobile device to request anything from room service to towels, spa appointments, or valet. This makes it very easy for guests staying at our member hotels to request and receive service.” Osgood noted that Preferred Hotels & Resorts properties also value Digital Alchemy’s Automated Bounce Back program that enables them to notify guests of special repeat-guest offers to strengthen loyalty. Digital Alchemy’s email platform also identifies members of iPrefer, Preferred Hotels & Resorts’ guest loyalty program, when they make a reservation. The system automatically creates a custom ‘iPrefer member ‘Welcome Back’ message that recognizes their participation with appropriate program benefits. “Digital Alchemy has a corporate philosophy to do the best job possible for its hotel operator clients. And they do,” Osgood said. Digital Alchemy delivers instant revenue statistics that show hoteliers return on each email and campaign. Hoteliers track, reservation by reservation, which email campaigns resulted in new room bookings or amenity selection. Digital Alchemy’s emails let guests click through to their folios when needed and are widely used for property spa CRM marketing.
