While many of her friends are settling in to Brighton’s student digs, complete with dingy kitchens, mangy carpets and new housemates, she’s installed in a pretty, refurbished two-bedroom flat that’s just a stone’s throw from the seafront. She has a balcony, a secure entrance and a supermarket in the basement. Her mum’s been on the phone again. First question: does she know how to clean the cooker? “We didn’t want her to suffer again what she went through last year,” says Daksha Modha; she and her husband have bought the flat for their daughter. “At least she’s comfortable now.” 80% of all new buyers aged under 30 get financial assistance from their parents* Finding somewhere to live in her first year was a grim affair for Pia. Three student houses she had signed up for fell through and she was left with nowhere to live days before the start of term. “It was awful; landlords were demanding deposits within the hour, people kept dropping out and I’d never met most of my potential flatmates before,” she says. “And the houses were really horrible – dirty and uncared for. My dad took one look at them and said he wouldn’t want a dog or cat to live there, let alone his daughter.” At the eleventh hour the university offered her a place in halls for her first year. It was a stroke of luck because Brighton, like many university cities, sees a surge of students seeking accommodation in autumn. Investment into the student rental market is predicted to rise to £5.7 billion in 2015, up from £1.7 billion in 2014* Pia realised in the first term of her first undergraduate year that she’d have to move quickly to secure accommodation. Her parents decided to buy a property , and eventually found the two-bedroom flat their daughter now shares with an equally housetrained student friend. Daksha used her savings and equity in the Modha’s family home in order to fund the purchase. “We see it as a good investment ,” she says, though there are risks – such as a property’s value falling or it becoming hard to sell if, say, the university starts to drop down the league tables. There is no guarantee that demand will stay high. “As any student knows, finding the right place to live is almost as important as picking the right course, and students are full of tales of unscrupulous landlords who don’t honour contracts,” says Nik Taylor, community editor at online forum The Student Room. “If there’s any stress about where you live, that’s going to reflect on your work,” he says. “You don’t want to be going back to a place every night where you’re not happy.” Investment into the student rental market has increased by more than 300% in just one year* “ There are many ways of structuring residential mortgages so parents can give their student children a helping hand,\" says Craig Calder, head of mortgages at Barclays. “Parents can use their own property to spread the risk or agree to a joint mortgage with their child. There’s a variety of ways to help them get on the housing ladder even when they can’t afford a property of their own. However, whatever the arrangement is, it’s crucial to keep up mortgage repayments to avoid the risk of losing the property.” Daksha plans to rent to a professional couple after Pia graduates, and while she may be exacting about the cleaning, she doesn’t charge Pia any money at all to live there. “Before Pia started university we hadn’t planned on buying a property,” says Daksha, “but it just made sense for us in our situation.” • To find out more about how Barclays can support you, book an appointment with a Mortgage Advisor, at barclays.co.uk/mortgages » YOUR VIEWS The Telegraph asked readers if they had a child or grandchild at uni and, if so, would they help them buy a property? Investment “Here in Edinburgh you’re unlikely to find a flat near the uni for less than £450k. In my opinion, if you can afford to, it’s much better to buy the flat outright for your children and then sell it once they complete their degree, or if you have more than one child, their degrees. Treat it as an investment, not as a gift.”** Studying abroad “I have helped my children with accommodation stateside – they both attend New York State universities. The house was very reasonable and saves on the cost of air travel back and forth during frequent university breaks. They are expected to leave campus during their breaks, so this arrangement made sense.” Making a profit \"When my daughter was at uni in the Noughties, I lent her the money to buy a house in her name – prices were lower then. She shared with friends who paid her rent. After three years, she sold it and made £70,000 profit, which was a useful deposit six years later when she got married and bought a 'proper' house.\" INSIDER VIEW Craig Calder, Head of mortgages, Barclays Residential mortgages can be suitable for buying a place for a family to live in but when structuring the arrangements you may need to get advice on tax, including income tax on any monies received, gains (subject to principal private residence relief) and even inheritance tax. Miles Shipside, Housing analyst at estate agent Rightmove Parents and grandparents with good levels of equity in their homes can find very low rates when remortgaging – much cheaper than a buy-to-let loan. They are effectively buying with cash, so can negotiate hard with sellers. It’s a good capital return and growth asset too. Nik Taylor, Community editor at The Student Room Living in halls in your first year is an important student experience. After that, you can work out where the best place to buy is. If you choose a property, you know it will be a certain standard – private landlords can offer variable quality – so this option buys peace of mind. Your home may be repossessed if you do not keep up repayments on your mortgage. The options outlined above should not be regarded as advice, and terms, conditions and exclusions will apply for all mortgages. *Source: Council of Mortgage Lenders/JLL **Like all investments, property values can fall and money can be lost You may also be interested in: • What to know when buying a second home • Get your CV in tip-top shape • Join the mobile cheque movement • It pays to be smart with social media", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:43:24.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
