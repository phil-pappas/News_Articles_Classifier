The Village received an official Train Town USA resolution signed by Union Pacific Executive Chairman Jack Koraleski during a presentation at a recent Farmers Market community event. Union Pacific launched its Train Town USA Registry as part of the railroad’s 150th anniversary celebration in 2012.\n \n \n“We are proud to recognize Grant Park as we celebrate our growing up together,” said Adrian Guerrero, Union Pacific’s director – Public Affairs for Illinois. “Union Pacific was founded to help connect the nation from east to west. Our shared heritage with Grant Park is a source of pride as we remember our past while delivering the goods American businesses and families use every day.”\n \n \nUnion Pacific’s Villa Grove freight line through Grant Park was originally built in 1871 by the Chicago, Danville and Vincennes Railroad, which was consolidated with other railroads to form the Chicago & Eastern Illinois (C&EI) Railroad. C&EI was acquired by the Missouri Pacific, which eventually merged with Union Pacific.\n \nSource:-Union Pacific Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:04:26.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
