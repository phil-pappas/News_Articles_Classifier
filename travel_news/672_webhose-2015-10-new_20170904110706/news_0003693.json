Flights between Qatar and Morocco have now increased from seven to 10 times weekly, operated jointly by Qatar Airways seven times-a-week and by Royal Air Maroc three times-a-week.\nBoth Qatar Airways and Royal Air Maroc will be offering a consistent product with an all Boeing 787 Dreamliner operation between Doha and Casablanca.\nSpeaking at the press conference, Mr. Al Baker said: “Qatar Airways is delighted and proud to welcome its partner, Royal Air Maroc, to our hub and home, Hamad International Airport in Doha.\n“Our new partnership will strengthen both airlines and provide greater options and a seamless network for our passengers between the Middle East and Africa, and beyond. Royal Air Maroc’s thrice-weekly service between Casablanca and Doha combines with our own daily flights between the two cities to provide an enhanced operation, while the frequency increase not only supports inbound tourism and trade, but is also an important new link for onward travel in both destinations.”\nChairman and CEO of Royal Air Maroc, Mr. Driss Benhima said the partnership with Qatar Airways is crucial in the history of Royal Air Maroc. “This joint business allows us to create a bridge between Asia and Africa that will facilitate the movement of passengers in a seamless fashion on the extensive network of Qatar Airways in Asia and the comprehensive network of Royal Air Maroc in Africa,” he said.\nHis Excellency Mr. Aziz Rabbah, Morocco’s Minister of Infrastructure, Transport and Logistics who was part of the VIP delegation that came to Doha on Royal Air Maroc’s inaugural flight said: “This partnership enhances the brotherly relations between the State of Qatar and the Kingdom of Morocco in the field of air transport, and will also enhance the cultural, economic and social exchanges between the two countries.”\nQatar Airways’ joint business with Royal Air Maroc will offer much broader opportunities for passengers who will benefit from a greater choice of flights and connectivity to destinations such as Marrakech, Agadir, Dakar, Accra or Nouakchott, which will be complemented by frequent flyer benefits such as the ability to earn and redeem Qmiles on flights operated by Royal Air Maroc.\nThis partnership allows both airlines to compete more effectively and share revenue on routes within the joint business, connecting more than 40 African destinations in Royal Air Maroc’s network to more than 70 Qatar Airways destinations in the Middle East and Asia Pacific region.\nThis new agreement also allows passengers the possibility of purchasing a single itinerary combining flights on both Royal Air Maroc’s and Qatar Airways’ global networks, allowing them access to one-stop ticketing and baggage check-in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:56:15.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
