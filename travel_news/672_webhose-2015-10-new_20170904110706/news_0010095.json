Following the coast from the Ring of Kerry to Kinsale, their visit combined historic sites with spectacular scenery and some delicious local food.\nThe group included writers for national magazines and two of Toronto’s biggest newspapers. The aim of the trip was to inspire the journalists to share their travels and experiences here with their two million readers back home.\nThey enjoyed an action-packed itinerary designed by Fáilte Ireland which included Muckross House, Ross Castle and a boat trip on Lough Léin in Co Kerry. They also visited Valentia Island, where they were wowed by the 360°views at the top of Geokaun Mountain and sampled artisan ice-cream at the Valentia Island Farmhouse Dairy. They stopped off the Skellig Centre and cruised around Skellig Rock, visited Garnish Island and enjoyed night kayaking on Lough Hyne. They visited Baltimore Castle and continued to Kinsale, where they did a walking tour of the town and visited Desmond Castle.\nDana Welch, Tourism Ireland’s manager Canada, said: “ Tourism Ireland was delighted to invite these journalists to visit the South West. Working with influential travel and lifestyle media is a key element of our annual promotional programme in Canada, to continue to raise awareness of the island of Ireland, the Wild Atlantic Way and all the many things to see and do for Canadian holidaymakers.\n“2014 was the best year ever for Irish tourism from Canada – with visitor numbers increasing by +30% over 2013. And the outlook for 2015 is also positive, particularly given that the number of airline seats from Canada increased by +22% in the peak summer months . With new, year-round direct air access from Toronto to Dublin, o ur message for Canadian holidaymakers is that the island of Ireland has never been so convenient or more affordable to get to. Our extensive autumn campaign is now in full swing and aims to take advantage of late booking trends, as there is still plenty of business to play for.”\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:08:31.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
