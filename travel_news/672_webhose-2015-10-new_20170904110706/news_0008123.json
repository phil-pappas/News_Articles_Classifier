We will work collaboratively with the Government of Canada to determine the best path forward given the ongoing challenges faced by the Canadian postal system.\nEfforts are now underway to place the comprehensive program on hold in an orderly fashion. This involves roughly 460,000 addresses across the country which are currently in the process to be converted to community mailboxes.\nAs a result, all conversions planned for November and December 2015 and those announced for 2016 will be placed on hold. Customers impacted by this decision will receive a letter within the next few weeks advising them of the status of their mail delivery service.\nIn neighbourhoods where the 10-month internal and community conversion process is complete, customers will collect mail and parcels at their community mailbox. This includes customers set to begin receiving their mail and parcels in their boxes in October. We remain focused on maintaining reliable postal service to all Canadians without disruption.\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C6814&Transmission_Id=201510261704CANADANWWEB______C6814&DateId=20151026", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:48:01.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
