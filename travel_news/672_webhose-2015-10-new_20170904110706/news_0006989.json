The company worked with the Columbia College Chicago Department of Fashion Studies and the Re:new Project – a nonprofit that provides employment opportunities for refugee women – to transform the large fabric signs into 100 eco-friendly carry-on bags.\nStarting tomorrow, customers can purchase these upcycled backpacks and duffel bags by visiting the United Shop at unitedshop.com. The proceeds will benefit Re:new and the Alto Mayo Forest Carbon Project in Northern Peru.\n“United is committed to operating sustainably and responsibly, and that means finding creative ways to further reduce our impact on the environment,” said the airline’s Managing Director of Environmental Affairs and Sustainability Angela Foster-Rice. “As part of our Eco-Skies commitment, we are excited to give these banners a second life, and know our customers will enjoy taking home a piece of the friendly skies.”\nThe Challenge\nUnited challenged the students at Columbia College to create a carry-on bag from the banner material that could:\nFit under an airplane seat (9″x10″x17″)\nBe economical to make, yet attractive\nBe durable and wearable\nAfter United selected the winning designs, Re:new stepped in to produce the one-of-a-kind, hand-sewn bags featuring distinct skyline images from the airline’s hub cities.\n \nSource:- United Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:37:11.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
