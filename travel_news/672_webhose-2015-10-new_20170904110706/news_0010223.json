But rental bikes don’t often have all the bells and whistles you may have gotten used to with your own tried-and-true bicycle. That means you need to consider bringing along the most important elements when you rent, like a bike light. The Nite Ize Inova STS Bike Light is a center-mount light with an easy-access, waterproof battery compartment, so you don’t have to worry about the rain ruining your illumination. Five modes per LED color (white and red) let you vary the power of the beam, as well as use strobe and lockout features. Best of all: You don’t need tools to attach and remove it with the stretch, grip-tight attachment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:48:24.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
