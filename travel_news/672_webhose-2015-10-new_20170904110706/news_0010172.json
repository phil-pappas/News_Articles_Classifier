McCoy . \"These are highly educated, successful, and well-respected women in their community, and the treatment they received was disgraceful and illegal.\"\nThe plaintiffs are seeking damages, the implementation of a racial sensitivity training program for the Wine Train management and staff, and the prevention of similar treatment to other minorities.\nThe lawsuit was filed on Oct. 1 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco ( See Lisa Johnson , et al. v Napa Valley Wine Train, Inc. et al, Case No. 3:15-cv-04515).\nHistory\nOn Aug. 22, 2015 , the 11 women, eight members of a book club plus three of their friends, boarded the Napa Valley Wine Train for a birthday celebration. Less than halfway into the trip, the plaintiffs - 10 of whom are black â€“ allege they were targeted by the Wine Train staff because of their race and kicked off the train for \"#LaughingWhileBlack.\" As they were disembarked, the plaintiffs, aged 36 to 85, were marched through the six cars comprising the entire train and turned over to police who detained the women in the hot sun.\nNapa Valley Wine Train officials posted a false statement on their public Facebook page alleging the book club members directed \"verbal and physical abuse towards other guests and staff,\" necessitating police involvement in the incident. That statement, though later deleted, was republished by countless international, national and regional media outlets seen by millions of people.\nFor More Information contact:\nBob Gold & Associates\nMike Levenstein (cell) 323-578-0760\nBob Gold (office) 310-320-2010\nBob@bobgoldpr.com\nOr\nWaukeen Q.
