The bridge will also help join communities in the town together by providing better step-free access to the public across Port Talbot.\nThe steelwork in the new bridge weighs 400 tonnes – the same weight as 58 African elephants.\nThe bridge was temporarily closed over two weekends in order to carry out the work safely. One of the largest cranes in the country was located on the road and used to lift sections of the bridge into place.\nThe work was scheduled to take place over the weekend to cause the minimum amount of disruption to passengers and the local community.\nNia Watkins, project manager for Network Rail Wales, said: “Revitalising Port Talbot Parkway gives the community a station they can be proud of and also acts as a catalyst for further regeneration in the area, helping to boost the economy locally in the long term.\n“The new bridge will provide an accessible route for everyone from the station entrance right through to the platforms and provides better facilities for the increasing number of passengers using the railway in Wales.\n“I’d like to thank passengers and local residents for their patience while we carry out this enhancement work, which will create lasting improvements as part of our Railway Upgrade Plan.”\nSome amenities at the station have already been improved, including an updated waiting room and new toilets with baby changing facilities and disabled access. A new information hub gives passengers easy access to a dedicated customer information office where staff can offer assistance.\nThere will also be a 111-space car park with a park and ride for commuters and better facilities for cyclists, bus passengers and taxis.\nThe £11.4m regeneration project at Port Talbot Parkway station is being carried out as part of the Wales Station Improvement Scheme. The work is being funded by the European Regional Development Fund, Welsh Government, Department for Transport, Network Rail, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council and Arriva Trains Wales.\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:27:17.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
