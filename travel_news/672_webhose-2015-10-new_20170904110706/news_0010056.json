These developments combined with our new 'Keys to the City' experience firmly distinguish the hotel's commitment to welcome the world to Chicago .\"\nGuest Room Design\nDesigned with the luxury traveler in mind, the new guest rooms are now the most technologically advanced in the world. Designer Bill Rooney of Bill Rooney Studio, Inc ., conceived contemporary interiors with cosmopolitan attitude in keeping with The Peninsula's prime location in the heart of Chicago . Mr. Rooney took design cues from luxury yachts: fine wood finishes, lush fabrics, rich leathers, and a sense of purpose where everything has its place. Built-in desks and vanities in rich wood grains create a luxuriously functional and interactive experience. An intimate dining table positioned at the window provides unrestrained, panoramic views of the Chicago skyline.\nA hand-crafted floral art piece by artist David Qian anchors each guest room and features the chrysanthemum, the official flower of Chicago and one of the four \"noble flowers\" of Asia , marrying the brand's Asian heritage with its Chicago influence. Bespoke chinaware featuring the chrysanthemum has been designed by Bernadaud exclusively for the hotel.\nWith nods to Chicago's connection to Lake Michigan and the Chicago River, deep-blue textiles and custom-designed Pratesi linens with a signature blue and wave pattern complement the furnishings of rich wood and cream leather. Chicago -based artist Jean-Jacques Porret created abstract bronze sculptures for each guest room.\nThe 74 newly redesigned suites at The Peninsula Chicago showcase custom artwork influenced by Chicago's rich artistic culture. Each suite features a hand-embroidered silk chrysanthemum art wall, along with hand-painted artisan glass elements by artist Michael Glickman that provide a decidedly chic yet residential feel. A nutrition center and Nespresso coffee amenities are housed in a hand-painted Chinoiserie cabinet designed by David Qian .\nTechnology\nIntroducing Peninsula's signature technology to the United States for the first time, the new rooms feature fully customized interactive digital bedside and desk tablets preset in one of 11 languages (English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese). Full control of all in-room functions is just a touch away, enabling control of all guest room lighting, room temperature controls, restaurant menus, hotel services, city information and attractions and TV channels. LED touch-screen wall panels offer weather details, language and privacy options.\nWith complimentary long distance, VOIP calls at the touch of a button, complimentary WiFi, tablets with 11 languages, 24-hour check in, PressReader (complimentary access to more than 2,000 international publications), as well as \"PenCities,\" (an up-to-the-moment online city guide), and LUXE printed city guides, all visitors can feel at home at The Peninsula Chicago.\nNew Service Experiences\nTo celebrate its new guest rooms, The Peninsula Chicago is introducing two exciting new service initiatives: 24-Hour Check-In for web bookings and Keys to the City.
