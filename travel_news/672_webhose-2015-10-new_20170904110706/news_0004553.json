It’s a steep climb up the ridge, but slow and steady wins the race. \nWe looked straight at Makalu, Lhotse and Cho Oyo – three of the six highest mountains in the world – it’s an incredible vista. \nAfter a hike back down and lunch, the rest of the day was ours to pick up some necessary supplies and enjoy a hot cocoa and piece of chocolate cake at one of the village’s bakeries. \nWe set off early in the morning day eight, up the Khumbu valley, passing yak herders’ shacks along the way. \nThe views of the twin peaks of Taboche and Cholatse, as they rise steeply above the open alpine valley, are outstanding. Arakam Tse appears steadily closer as we continued ascending to the village of Dughla. \nWe took a breather at this little streamside town before the final stretch up over the Thokla Pass to Lobuche, our home for the night and the last stop before our trek to Everest Base Camp. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:47:19.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
