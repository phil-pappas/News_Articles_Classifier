This winter the Sugar Bay Hotel (formerly Amaryllis) and The Sands (formers Sandy Beach) will also open their doors as all-inclusive products, adding 300 new rooms. \nThe Wyndham Hotel project at the site of the iconic Sam Lord’s Castle and the Hyatt Hotel in the historic Bridgetown, will see the island welcoming two new established global hotel brands by 2018.

During these year-long celebrations there will be chances to win free vacations and free destination weddings, as well as incentives for our top-performing travel agents.” Oct 21, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:01:58.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
