(NASDAQ: HDP), the leader in Open Enterprise Hadoop, today announced LHP Telematics (LHPT) , an industry leader in creating custom telematics solutions for both the heavy equipment OEM marketplace and aftermarket construction fleets, is using the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP™) to turn data into actionable insights for the Metro Transit of St. Louis (MTL). By using HDP, LHPT helps keep MTL buses operating safely and reliably, serving the greater St. Louis region all year round.\nInitiating a proactive bus maintenance program, MTL developed the K Plan to combine historical data on bus component failures, comply with changing emission standards and adjust to a smaller work force. To deliver on the K Plan, the LHPT data science team ran algorithms on HDP for pattern recognition to correlate events to component failures and weed out maintenance inefficiencies. As a result, MTL can predict when a component on a particular bus will fail, raising the average time between bus failures by a factor of five.\n\"We did not expect to get as much information as we did with access to data from HDP,\" said Darren Curry , chief mechanical officer for MTL. \"I still believe that we will be able to increase our performance with LHPT and Hortonworks another two to three times on top of what we have achieved.\"\nMTL estimates that since initiating the K Plan solution on its buses, the mean time between failures has further extended by 25,000 to 30,000 miles. With the launch of the K Plan, MTL also experienced improvement on operating mileage and a 30 percent increase in bus lifespan. More than two-thirds of the MTL bus fleet has been equipped with the LHPT and Hortonworks solution – with complete implementation expected in 2018.\n\"We are thrilled to work with LHP Telematics as a customer and look forward to continuing our work with them in creating custom telematics solutions for even higher levels of efficiency,\" said Mark Ledbetter , vice president of industry solutions at Hortonworks. \"Hortonworks is dedicated to supporting the telematics market and helping customers become successful, data driven companies.\"\nHDP enables the deployment of Open Enterprise Hadoop. It's the only platform that is 100 percent open, leveraging the latest innovations from the open source community.
