More than 6,000 fans enjoyed a full schedule of activities, capped off by a free concert by country superstar Trace Adkins who treated fans to an hour-long performance of his biggest hits. \nDarren Woodson, a three-time Super Bowl champion with the Cowboys, served as emcee for the event, which also included appearances by the Cowboys' mascot Rowdy, the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, Dallas Cowboys Rhythm & Blue Dancers and Dallas Cowboys Rhythm & Blue Drumline. \nAttendees took part in games that brought Carnival's unique cruise experience to life, with mini-golf, a bean bag toss, ping pong, an inflatable slide shaped like the line's iconic funnel, face-painting and a re-creation of the Football Academy training camp. Carnival also provided fans a taste of its onboard food and beverage offerings with a mocktail station featuring refreshing beverages inspired by the Caribbean-themed RedFrog Pub and BlueIguana Cantina Mexican eatery. \nThroughout the day, contestants were chosen at random and given the chance to compete in a football toss against the perennial all-star Woodson. At the top of every hour, one lucky attendee was chosen to win a Carnival cruise giveaway. \nCarnival is Texas' most popular cruise line with three ships sailing year-round from Galveston – Carnival Freedom, Carnival Magic and Carnival Triumph. Together, these three ships carry more than 600,000 guests a year – the most of any cruise operator. \n\"Creating fun and memorable moments is at the heart of what we do here at Carnival Cruise Line,\" said Christine Duffy, Carnival's president. \"Even though this is a bye week for the Cowboys, we're thrilled to bring our unmistakable brand of spirit and excitement to create a fun game day atmosphere for Dallas fans.\" \n\"We couldn't ask for a better partner than Carnival Cruise Line to help us keep up the Cowboys spirit even on a bye week,\" said Eric Sudol, Vice President, corporate partnership sales and service for the Dallas Cowboys. \"We were excited to see fans and Dallas residents not only enjoy Carnival's activities but interact with the Dallas Cowboys' fan favorites and Cowboys legend, Darren Woodson. Carnival's Ultimate Cowboys Fan Fest truly mirrored what we love to achieve at AT&T Stadium with our fans.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:37:22.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
