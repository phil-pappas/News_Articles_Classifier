Yes. On my current tour I've been to Canada, the US, South America , Europe and Bahrain. My partner and I also managed to cram in a five-day holiday in Turkey earlier in the year. But it was out of season, so sadly I couldn't really sunbathe. What do you need for a perfect holiday? My boyfriend - I never like to go away without him. Having a good time on holiday is all about the company you keep. I'd prefer to be somewhere hot, too. The beach coast of Putsborough, Devon Photo: Alamy Where did you go on holiday as a child? Mainly in England. We'd often go to Putsborough, Devon , which has a massive beach. I still love visiting Putsborough because you can walk for miles and take your dog there. First trip abroad? I think it was France , when I was about eight - but I have bad memories of it. Being vegetarian made it difficult, too. Even now if you go to France and tell them you're a vegetarian, I always get: \"You're what? What on earth is a 'veggie'?!\" But I've grown to like France more over the years. Do you travel adventurously? Yes, the first thing I like to do when I go somewhere is hire a scooter or a car, to go off and explore the area. I like to be free - I don't want to be stuck in a hotel. I think I got that from my mum. I remember on a holiday with her in Greece , she hired a Jeep, and off we went on this little adventure. The most adventurous thing I've done is swing through trees in the jungle in Costa Rica . The La Fortuna waterfall in Costa Rica Photo: Fotolia/AP The remotest place you've ever been? I'm an ambassador for Prince Harry's charity Sentebale , and a couple of years ago I visited a school in Lesotho to find out more about the work it does in Africa. Afterwards I travelled to a hotel in the mountains, which was in the middle of nowhere, and it was such a magical place. A river bend in Lesotho Photo: Fotolia/AP Your most luxurious travel experience? I once did a gig at the Capella hotel and resort complex in Mexico, which is just ridiculously luxurious. The entrance to the hotel was lined with flames, and you felt like you were the only one on the beach. The Capella hotel in Mexico Photo: Alamy Favourite hotel? I like a hotel with a good bed, and I don't think I've ever had a better night's sleep than when I've stayed at the W hotel in New York . Sleeping there is like sleeping on a little cloud. Favourite city? New York. It's so electric and full of life. I'm not really a city girl, but I love the Big Apple's energy. And if I need my nature fix, I can always hit Central Park . I particularly like Chelsea - and one of my favourite places to hang out is Tea & Sympathy, a café-style restaurant where they serve British classics like pasties and cucumber sandwiches. Worst travel experience? When I was very poorly while in South America earlier this year. I first became sick in Argentina - I think I was just exhausted from all the touring, so when I caught a bug that was going around, it really laid me low. But if you're on tour, no one really cares, they just want you to play the next gig! I was so unwell that I had to go on an intravenous drip and lie down on a sofa before the next few shows. It was pretty traumatising, but I managed to keep going until the end of the tour. Buildings in Chelsea, viewed from The High Line in New York Photo: Alamy Do you enjoy the 'rock-and-roll' tour bus lifestyle? Totally - I love it. I love having my own time and space to chill out. And you can have a little walk around the bus, which you can't do on a plane. I basically live on the bus when I'm on tour, and I can't be bothered to move all my stuff into a hotel room. I always sleep well on the bus, too. But when I'm not sleeping, I'll watch a movie or sit up the front and chat to the driver. Best beauty tip for travelling? Drink lots of water, and use moisturiser to avoid your skin drying out on a flight. And bring little things with you that are going to make you feel better, like a hairbrush, and don't forget your toothbrush. Your travel essential? Lip balm - I never travel without it. Putting it on just makes me think: \"Ah, that's better…\" Silly, I know. The Blue Lagoon in Iceland Photo: Getty Images Where next? I'd love to go somewhere like Iceland or Canada to see the Northern Lights . I know it's going to be chilly - I'll just have to make sure I take a woolly hat, scarf and gloves!
