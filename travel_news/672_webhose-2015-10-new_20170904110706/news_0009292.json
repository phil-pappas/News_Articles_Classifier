Related Content Stolen Car Found with Suspects Hours After a Foot Chase \nEven though efforts were made to separate the 50th anniversary party on Oct. 1, with the three day California Avocado Festival Oct. 2-4, some of the activities blended together and both local residents and guests came out by the thousands. \nThe jubilee celebration featured speeches and resolutions by civic leaders, and the return of some of the past city council members, police officials, and those who originally founded the city in 1965. \nAfter an afternoon to reflect back on the first 50 years of the quiet seaside city, free cake was cut up and served to everyone who attended. \nA specially ticketed gala was held under a large tent with live music, food and dancing. \nIt was followed by the annual Avofest which drew thousands of people Friday and Saturday. Sunday's event was shut down a little early when a very rare rain came in. \nBefore that however, the annual World Championship of Guacamole took place. Even with more than a dozen judges, many new, and 17 entries, Mark Schniepp, last years winner, took the title again. He even changed his recipe slightly. The entries were judges on presentation for one award, then taste and texture for the overall award. \nFor the four day event in the center of town, one of the most popular highlights was a 55-foot tall Ferris wheel on Linden Ave. The festival and the gala had over 70 bands. \nIt is also a zero waste festival with everything recycled or in a food compost system. Organizers say they run the largest free, zero waste festival in California. \nCopyright Â© 2015 NPG of California, LLC. All rights reserved.
