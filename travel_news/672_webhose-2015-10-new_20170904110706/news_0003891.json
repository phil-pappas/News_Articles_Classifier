A broader and more varied experience is key if we want to increase tourist numbers. That's why developing the local tourism product is one of the priorities included in Tourisme Montréal's strategic plan for 2014 to 2018. In 2014, an Investment Development Committee was created to oversee this initiative. Led by Tourisme Montréal, the group includes Investissement Québec, Fonds de solidarité FTQ, the Business Development Bank of Canada and Montréal International. The committee's goal is to develop a better understanding of business opportunities for tourist products, analyze the competition, solicit investors and forge connections with local businesses, private investors and international real estate developers. \"Product development is closely linked with Tourisme Montréal's mission and the various tourism and financial leaders have to be proactive in attracting international investors to promote growth in Montréal and enhance the city's reputation,\" said Yves Lalumière, president and CEO of Tourisme Montréal. With a dynamic tourism industry, substantial growth in 2015, promising projections for 2016 and the city's 375 th anniversary celebrations on the agenda for 2017, Montréal is well positioned to attract new tourism players, which will in turn foster growth within the city. \"Investing in the tourism industry is investing in local job creation. Fonds de solidarité FTQ recognizes how important this sector is for Quebec's economy and has supported its development ever since we began investment activities in the late 1980s,\" said Janie Béïque, Senior Vice-President, Industry, Entertainment and Consumer Goods at Fonds de solidarité FTQ \"We are very pleased to join forces with Tourisme Montréal and its partners to better support the development of Montréal's tourist offer, as it will benefit Québec as a whole.\" About Tourisme Montréal Tourisme Montréal is responsible for providing leadership in the concerted efforts of hospitality and promotion in order to position the \"Montréal\" destination on leisure and business travel markets. It is also responsible for developing Montréal's tourism product in accordance with the ever-changing conditions of the market.
