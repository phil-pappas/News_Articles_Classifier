In the summer timetable announced later today no less than five new destinations will appear.Although winter is coming up, the temperatures are already rising at Brussels Airlines. The company’s strategy to include popular vacation regions in its flight offer continues in 2016.\n \nBrussels Airlines adds five new destinations and many extra flight frequencies to existing destinations in the summer offer, which can already be booked as from tomorrow.Tourist attractions such as the Greek Crete and the South Spanish Jerez are added to the summer offer. With Belfast Brussels Airlines also expands her network to Northern Ireland. Tenerife and Las Palmas / Gran Canaria – two routes that are launched this winter season – are also offered during the summer season. An overview:\n \nJerez \n \nSherry wine, tapas and flamenco… Numerous ingredients of the Andalusian culture and gastronomy have their roots in Jerez de la Frontera. With Jerez, Brussels Airlines adds one of the most attractive South-Spanish cities to its network. More and more tourists visit the city and its surroundings each year. Wine tasters will be delighted to visit the well-known Sherry bodegas and wine cellars of Tio Pepe, Domecq or William Hubert. Horse lovers will relish the famous Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Ecuestre. Motor freaks can attend one of the many races at the F1-circuit located nearby.\n \nJerez is at the same time the perfect base for those who want to visit the coastal areas surrounding Cadiz and Puerto de Santa Maria or Pueblos Blancos in the mountains. Also the golf courses and luxury hotels of Novo Sancti Petro / Sciclana and Rota – which is very popular amongst Belgians – are just a stone’s throw away from Jerez.\n \nJerez is Brussels Airlines’ third destination in Andalusia. There are several flights a day to Malaga and Seville is served several times a week. Right across the border of Portugal Brussels Airlines already flies frequently to Faro. Flights to and from the different airports can be combined so as to make fly & drive holidays in the area possible as well.\n \nThe new route to Jerez de la Frontera starts in May and will last until the end of September. Flights are operated on Wednesdays and Sundays.Brussels, Brussels Airlines launches a new customer programme called Loop, which is available for all flights in the European network of the airline. LOOP is designed for the increasing number of customers that flies Brussels Airlines regularly within Europe and does not receive significant benefits from traditional frequent flyer programmes.\n \nIn the first nine months of 2015, Brussels Airlines welcomed 5.7 million passengers, which represents a growth of +12.4% and a new record in the history of the company. This growth is a result of a new commercial strategy that the airline introduced in 2014 to strengthen its position in a European market with continuously growing competition. With LOOP, Brussels Airlines presents a new programme as an addition to the existing Miles & More programme, to offer its customers more advantages, faster. LOOP wants to break with conventions of the traditional frequent flyer programmes. For each euro spent on Brussels Airlines flights (excluding airport taxes), customers receive three LOOPs, which is what the points in the loyalty programme are called. At the occasion of the launch of LOOP, each euro will temporarily be worth 6 LOOPs (until 31 December). Comparable with a fidelity card in a supermarket, travelers can use these LOOPs to book new flights.\n \nUp to five family members living under the same roof can collect LOOPs together, in order to have access to a free flight even faster. Restrictions on when points can be used are a thing of the past, as there are no blackout dates. LOOPs can be used on any European Brussels Airlines flight once the customer has flown five return flights or has earned 5,000 LOOPs. In case the customer does not have enough LOOPs, he or she can pay in part with points, in part with money. Moreover, LOOPs never expire, as long as the participant flies once a year with Brussels Airlines within Europe.\n \nSource:-Brussels Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:46:23.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
