Joining hands with Hong Kong Disneyland, T Galleria and HK Outlets, Hong Kong Airlines and the online travel platforms aim to promote Hong Kong tourism, attracting more Chinese tourists to experience the beauty of Hong Kong and Macau.\n \n \nIn the past two decades, China’s outbound tourism market has been growing rapidly. Since its first record in 1998, statistics have showed that the number of Chinese tourists traveling abroad has increased over 10 times, from 8.43 million to over 100 million in 2004, in which 65% traveled to Hong Kong/Macau. Popularity of Hong Kong as their destinations among Chinese tourists is beyond doubt. To further showcase the glamour of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Airlines joins forces with Alitrip and UUYOYO.COM to launch a special travel product – “Charismatic Hong Kong – 5d4n Hong Kong/Hong Kong & Macau Tour” (“Charismatic Hong Kong”), bringing them the most fascinating travel experience in Hong Kong.\n \n“Charismatic Hong Kong” is the fruit of joint efforts by four well-known enterprises – Hong Kong Airlines, Hong Kong Disneyland, T Galleria and HK Outlets. Travelers can experience the real Hong Kong from the airlines’ quality services and have extra fun in Hong Kong Disneyland’s new attractions celebrating its 10th anniversary. All tourists joining the tour will receive a scarf from international top brand (valued RMB$3000 or above) and exquisite cosmetics gift pack from T Galleria. The travel package is now exclusively available for pre-sale on Alitrip website. Users simply have to pay a deposit of RMB$299 to book, and settle the balance on or before 11 November to complete the payment.\n \nAnd to welcome the famous shopping fest in Mainland China “11·11″, Hong Kong Airlines is rolling out a series of attractive promotions on Alitrip starting from yesterday. From 15 October to 11 November, air ticket auctions will take place 6 times a day, attracting all Chinese netizens to fight for RMB$1* one-way air ticket from Hangzhou to Hong Kong. On the other hand, Hong Kong Airlines is extending the sales platforms of AIRPASS from official website and mobile APP, to Alitrip online platform exclusively from 11 November to 11 December. It offers various combinations in either four or six sets of Economy Class to be used within 6 months, starting from 1 January to 30 June 2016#. The minimum price of 6 sets of one-way Alitrip AIRPASS between Huanan region (Fuzhou and Sanya) and Hong Kong is just as low as RMB$2400, which means it is RMB$400 per set only.\n \n \nMr. Li Dianchun, Commercial Director of Hong Kong Airlines, said over the press conference, “Development of aviation and tourism are complementary. As a Hong Kong-based airline, Hong Kong Airlines adheres to the concept of ‘Fresh and Very Hong Kong’, and is committed to provide quality service which best shown the beauty of Hong Kong. By cooperating with Mainland enterprises, we are dedicated to offering passengers with an extraordinary flight experience, promoting the long-term development of Hong Kong and Macau tourism. With our attentive service and professional fleet, we strive to expand the route network and fleet size, bringing more passengers to Hong Kong and contributing more to the industry.”\n \nSource:- Hong Kong Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:39:51.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
