Monteverde/Santa Elena hostels and backpacker hotels: Monteverde Backpackers , Pension Santa Elena , Cabinas Tina's Casitas Hotel Guanacaste in Liberia. Kirsten Hubbard 4. Liberia \nLiberia isn't much of a destination in its own right. But many Costa Rica backpackers stay there because of its central \"crossroads\" location at the northeast edge of the Nicoya Peninsula , as well of its possession of the only Costa Rica international airport outside San Jose. Liberia is also the best jumping-off place for visiting the volcanic landscape of Rincon de la Vieja National Park . \nLiberia hostels and budget hotels: Hotel Liberia (one block from Central Park; 666 0161), Hotel Guanacaste (by the bus station; 666 0085), La Posada del Tope (on Calle Real; 666 3876) Drake Bay on the Osa Peninsula. Anita Hermecz 5. The Osa Peninsula \nThe Osa Peninsula in Costa Rica's remote southwest is one of the best Costa Rica destinations for adventure travelers on a budget. Corcovado National Park , the crown jewel of the Osa Peninsula, was heralded by National Geographic as \"the most biologically intense place on Earth.” Top backpacker destinations in the Osa Peninsula include Drake Bay , Puerto Jimenez and Matalpo, as well as other beaches along the peninsula's coasts. \nOsa Peninsula budget jungle lodges and hostels: Cabinas Manolo and the Poor Man's Paradise Resort in Drake Bay; Cabinas Marcelina in Puerto Jimenez .

Quepos & Manuel Antonio Manuel Antonio is a must-visit for Costa Rica backpackers seeking perfect beaches and lush jungle scenery – which probably includes every Costa Rica backpacker!

Buses leave Quepos for Manuel Antonio every half hour for the fifteen minute ride (about 25 cents US). Problem solved.

La Fortuna & the Arenal Region \nMany travelers arrive in La Fortuna through the famous Jeep Boat Jeep combo from Santa Elena/Monteverde. La Fortuna is located at the foot of the Arenal Volcano , which you can climb for an up-close glimpse at some fiery magma. Cheap rooms and restaurants are plentiful -- though a day at the hot springs of Baldi Termae or Tabacon is worth the splurge. La Fortuna hostels and budget accommodations: Arenal Backpackers Resort , Cabinas Arsol (cabins or dorm beds), Hotel Jardines Arenal 9. The Nicoya Peninsula \nA number of Costa Rica's most popular beaches are located on the Nicoya Peninsula , a massive hunk of land jutting out from the country's northwest coast.

Ecotel in Playa Hermosa, Tamarindo Backpackers in Playa Tamarindo, Tranquilo Backpackers in Mal Pais. More » 10. Puerto Viejo \nCosta Rica's Caribbean Coast is much less traveled than its Pacific Coast. But for Costa Rica budget travelers, that's usually a good thing: cheaper prices, less crowds, and underexplored natural attractions. Puerto Viejo, south of Limon, offers backpackers leisurely days and lively nights, as well as accessibility to other Caribbean hotspots.
