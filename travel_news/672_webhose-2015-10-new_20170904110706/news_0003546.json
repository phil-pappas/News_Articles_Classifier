The new chargers will be installed in two phases, the first of which has already begun. Ultimately, Honda estimates that the chargers will enable hundreds of associates to use an EV for their daily commute.\nTo support the local community in conjunction with the project, Honda is installing a publicly-accessible DC \"fast\" charger on Harpers Way, adjacent to its campus, which will enable Torrance residents to rapidly refuel EVs equipped with DC charging capabilities. The fee-based DC Fast charger will open in early 2016 and will support both the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo standards.\n\"Making workplace charging ubiquitous and accessible is the cornerstone of an effective public charging strategy that supports the maximum number of vehicles,\" said Steven Center, vice president of Honda's Environmental Business Development Office and Product Regulatory Office. \"This expansion will make commuting in an EV a convenient option for the vast majority of Honda associates in Torrance , including those without access to charging at their homes or apartment buildings.\"\nFunding for the project was provided, in part, by a California Energy Commission (CEC) grant. Honda's announcement coincides with its participation in \"Drive the Dream 2015,\" an event hosted by the California Plug-in Electric Vehicle Collaborative and attended by Governor Jerry Brown to encourage businesses across the state to install workplace charging.\nHonda will offer several next-generation, advanced powertrain vehicles, including a new fuel cell vehicle (FCV) set to launch next year, followed by a new battery-electric model and a new plug-in hybrid model by 2018. The new EV chargers on the Torrance campus will complement existing refueling options on-site, including compressed natural gas and hydrogen refueling stations.\nHonda's Environmental Commitment\nBased on its vision of \"Blue Skies for our Children,\" Honda is working to advance technologies that address society's environmental and energy concerns. The company's \"Green Path\" approach seeks to reduce or eliminate the use of substances of concern (SOCs) and scarce natural resources in the design of its vehicles, significantly reduce the CO 2 intensity and water use of its manufacturing operations, continue to decrease CO 2 emissions from the transportation of vehicles from its plants to dealers, and expand the involvement of U.S. Honda and Acura dealers in its \"Green Dealer\" program.\nThese activities reinforce Honda's goal to voluntarily reduce its total corporate CO 2 emissions by 50 percent by the year 2050, compared to 2000 levels. In 2006, Honda was the first auto company to voluntarily and publicly commit to global reductions in its CO 2 emissions.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/277163\n releases/honda-to-add-120-ev-chargers-to-torrance-campus-300160298.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA28976&Transmission_Id=201510151100PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA28976&DateId=20151015", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/277163", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151014/277163", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/honda-to-add-120-ev-chargers-to-torrance-campus-300160298.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:22:53.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
