While Thanksgiving is guaranteed to be just as special as ever this year, a different November weekend is garnering the most attention. From November 20th - 22nd, Woodloch will host its first-ever \"Nashville Songwriters Weekend,\" where guests will get to meet the songwriters for some of today's most popular country performers including: Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw, Jason Aldean, Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, and Big & Rich. \nThe idea was originally conceived when Woodloch's Social Director, Joey Ranner, and long-time guest, Jon D'Agostino, were discussing their shared love of country music. It just so happens that D'Agostino is the owner of Demolition Music Publishing, the Nashville publishing firm on the world-famous \"Music Row.\" The idea of bringing Nashville to Woodloch seemed only natural. \n\"Music has always been a passion of mine,\" says D'Agostino. \"Of course, I love listening to the final product from performers like Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert and Rascal Flatts. Many of these acts, however, perform songs written by professional songwriters. For me, there's a definite thrill of knowing the real inspiration and stories to these popular songs that are all over the radio. The writers are somewhat unsung heroes.\" \nIn addition to the bonfires, line-dancing, Southern BBQ and bourbon samplings that Woodloch has planned for the weekend, the all-inclusive resort will hold its very own songwriting competition. Over the years, Woodloch has hosted its own versions of talent shows themed after popular television shows such as American Idol and America's Got Talent. During the weekend, guests will have the chance to have their songwriting skills evaluated by a professional talent scout. In addition to receiving a complimentary stay at Woodloch, the winner(s) will have the eyes and attention of some of Nashville's top songwriters such as: Jeff Cohen, James, Slater, Dylan Altman, Jamie Floyd, Jimmy Robbins, Pete Sallis, and Adam Searan. \n\"Putting all of this together, we thought it was the perfect time to create our first ever Woodloch Songwriting Competition,\" says Ranner. \"We've heard some exceptional voices here, but there's also been a lot of great original music that has been shared. I'm excited to see how this pans out.\" \nDuring Nashville Songwriters Weekend, all-inclusive rates start at just $165 per adult per night.
