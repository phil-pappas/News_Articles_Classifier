To commerate her, Cavell Nurses' Trust has launched the 'Moments of Thanks' campaign, asking people to thank the medical professionals who have touched their lives and share Edith's values in the present day. The campaign hopes to celebrate nurses and midwives whose work is often \"under-appreciated or unacknowledged\". Steve Charlton, chief executive at Cavell Nurses’ Trust, said: \"Our nurses are there for us from childbirth through to the end of our lives. \"They offer support and comfort through some of the most challenging times, but all too often we don’t get the chance to say thank you. \"This isn’t about clinical excellence – it’s about celebrating those precious moments of connection that can make all the difference to a hospital experience: a reassuring hand on the shoulder or a well-timed chat.\" Here are some of the most touching dedications. Edith Cavell's statue Photo: David Rose To the nurse I went to primary school with... My mum was recently undergoing tests ahead of starting her 3rd bout of chemotherapy for her 3rd different type of cancer. The fun of the fair, huh. Recognising my mum's surname from my time at school with the nurse 20 years prior, she asked 'you're not Charlie's mum are you?'. This kicked off great merriment and recounting of stories from years gone by. Such distraction was exactly what she needed. When I saw my mum the next day, she didn't mention her pain, simply that she'd seen an old school chum of mine and how great the care was she'd received from her. Thank you for brightening her day. From, Charlie To Sophie the midwife... I would like to say a massive thank you to a midwife called Sophie at Dorchester hospital. When we lost our baby in December 2013 she was by my side through the whole journey from the horrific delivery, including the operation and the two days in hospital. Furthermore she supported us for 6 months after, with home visits (in a flooded house); she came to appointments with consultants, made telephone calls and sent text messages. She guided me through like a guardian angel, I will be forever grateful for her kindness. She is a very special lady with a big heart, professional integrity and compassion. Thank you Sophie I wouldn't have got through the toughest challenge of my life without you. From, Sarah To the nurses in the hospice... When my grandma was ill, the whole family struggled to come to terms with what was happening. The nurses in the hospice worked really hard to make sure that we could all try and have a few moments of normality, taking her outside into the sun so she could wear her favourite hat, laughing at her terrible jokes. She had some pictures that she wanted to be able to see, and the nurses put them up for her, when she was sad they sat with her if we couldn’t be there and brought her photos from off of the side for her to hold. Without the nurses at the hospice, the last weeks of her life would have been all the more painful for her and the family. Thank you, ladies, for restoring a little bit of humanity, for showing compassion, for having neverending patience, and for comforting the family with shoulder-squeezes and cups of tea. From, Gary Princess Anne and Belgium's Princess Astrid unveil a bust of World War I nurse Edith Cavell Photo: AP To the nurses at John Radcliffe hospital... I can’t thank the nurses enough at The John Radcliffe Hospital, who nearly 25 years ago, were absolutely fantastic in supporting both my mother and myself. Having been born 3-months premature and my mother requiring immediate open-heart surgery – there was a fear that neither of us would survive – but thanks to their commitment, undying attention and compassion, we both made a full-recovery and are extremely grateful that we are both still here to tell the tale. If I could, I’d love to be able to tell them personally how much their efforts mean to us, but that same message goes out to all nurses – your efforts will never go unnoticed – you don’t realise the impact you have on each and every one of us who you tend to with so much care and attention. From, Wesley To the midwives at UCH hospital... I would like to thank the midwives at UCH hospital who were all A-M-A-Z-I-N-G for the birth of my three children! They were kind, wise and went the extra mile every single time. My husband and I are so grateful. Thanks so much! From, Anonymous A portrait of Nurse Edith Cavell in uniform - in the background a German firing squad Photo: Mary Evans Picture Library To the ICU nurses at the Royal Hallamshire hospital... At the worst possible time in my life nurses were our saving grace. Just over a year ago my 21 year old brother was rushed to the Hallamshire Neuro Intensive Care unit in Sheffield following a massive stroke caused by an aneurysm in his brain. As a family not only were we terrified and in a state of shock, we were struggling emotionally and physically to cope. At a time when our world was falling apart the specialist nurses in ICU were nothing other than incredible. Providing 1-1 care to my brother and attending his every need wasn't where there duties stopped. They supported us all as a family, provided a shoulder to cry on, gave explanation when required and made sure we were eating and drinking. They even let us all stay on the ward in the family room for the entire time my brother was there because we couldn't bear to leave. They went above and beyond to help us all so I'd like to say a huge thank you to the ICU nurses in that unit for all they did. Their simple acts of kindness were more than appreciated and they should be proud of the people they are and job they do!
