Special Halloween deals. All-air flights marked down. Seats are limited. Please RSVP. Must book online to qualify for discount. LAS VEGAS, NV, October 13,   In celebration of the Halloween holiday weekend, Grand Canyon Helicopter Tours is slashing prices by up to 30% on its hottest sightseeing flights from Las Vegas, NV, and South Rim, AZ. Las Vegas The Vegas tour that's received the deepest price cut is the air-only trip. It goes form Vegas and flies over Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, the Colorado River and the Canyon before heading back to town. This trip is just 3 hours long and perfect for travelers who have limited time to sightsee and who are on a tight budget. The discount rate is fixed and includes all taxes, fees and surcharges, as well as hotel pick up and drop off. Of course, there are more monster deals available, especially ones that fly below the rim and land at the bottom of the Canyon. The most popular of these tours is the one wherein travelers enjoy a Champagne picnic alongside the banks of the Colorado River. This popular tour can also be upgraded to include a Colorado River boat ride and a VIP pass to the Grand Canyon Skywalk, which is a glass bridge that lets guests walk some 70 feet past the edge and stand 4,000 feet over the bottom. South Rim The South Rim 30-minute basic all-air tour is this year's Halloween special. It goes from the South Rim to the North Rim and back via the Dragoon Corridor, which is the widest and deepest section of the National Park. Travelers who have the budget are urged to consider the 50-minute tour, which is the better value due to the fact that it visits both rims and the Corridor just like the 30-minute flight, as well as everything up to the East Rim of the Canyon. More than 75 percent of the Canyon will have been seen once guests complete the longer trip. Deluxe Tours There are two kinds of tours: Basic and Deluxe. The key difference is the kind of helicopter used. Basic flights utilize the older Bell Ranger or AStar helicopter, while deluxe tours use the superior EcoStar 130. What makes the EcoStar best is its cabin, which is 25 percent larger. This extra size results in it being fitted with a 180-degree windshield as well as stadium-style seats. The Halloween Weekend is a busy time at the Canyon. Thus travelers are urged to book their flights in advance and online. Rule of thumb is to book your heli ride at least a week or two ahead of time. Avoid booking within 48 hours as prices usually go up and availability goes down. Further, always try to book your tour online. The best deals, including the ones referenced in this press release, are only available over the Internet. To qualify for these discounts, make sure to complete your transaction online and afterwards wait to receive a confirmation number.
