Germay's Welt am Sonntag newspaper also reported that Mr Poetsch told managers last week that he was still certain the car giant would overcome the crisis. In a bid to regain public trust, VW has launched a media campaign, which included a full-page ad published in major German newspapers to mark the 25th anniversary of the country's reunification. The company used the column inches on Sunday to say it would set aside celebratory expressions, instead assuring the public that it would resolve the crisis. \"We just want to say one thing: We will do everything to win back your trust,\" the carmaker said in the advertisement. A VW passat undergoes an emissions test The German government has given VW until Wednesday to present a plan outlining how it will fix some 2.8 million vehicles in its home market fitted with illegal emissions-rigging software. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday called the disclosure by her country’s largest car maker that it had fitted \"defeat devices\" in up to 11 million of its vehicles worldwide to cheat government emissions tests \"a dramatic event\", and said Volkswagen must clarify the affair swiftly. But she also ruled out a longer-term impact on the country’s industry. \"I believe that the reputation of German industry, the trust in Germany as a business location, hasn’t been so shaken that we won’t continue to be seen as a good business location,” Ms Merkel told Deutschlandfunk radio in an interview. Volkswagen's new boss, Matthias Mueller, has vowed to repair the carmaker's damaged reputation following the biggest scandal in VW's 78-year history. A total 1.2 million of the affected cars were sold to UK consumers, including VWs, Audis, Seats, Skodas and commercial vehicles. The scandal has wiped almost €30bn off the company's value and prompted a raft of government investigations and lawsuits around the world as the carmaker issues a mass recall. An internal investigation at VW has already found several engineers who admitted to installing the fraudulent software in 2008 for VW's 'EA 189' diesel-motor models, according to reports in Bild am Sonntag newspaper. Bild claims that, at the time, project engineers determined there was no way to meet both emissions standards and cost controls. The solution was a so-called defeat device that switched on emissions controls when a car was being tested. Volkswagen has also found that more executives than previously thought were involved in the scandal, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported, citing officials close to the supervisory board. Volkswagen declined to comment to Bloomberg on the German newspaper reports. Former CEO Martin Winterkorn stepped down from the company on September 23 amid mounting pressure to resign, while Audi development chief Ulrich Hackenberg, a Winterkorn confidante who was responsible for VW brand development from 2007 to 2013, and Wolfgang Hatz, who ran the group’s powertrain development from 2007 and 2011, are among others who are rumoured to be leaving, according to people familiar with the matter. Engine-parts supplier Bosch is alleged to have warned VW in 2007 that its planned use of the software was illegal, Bild claimed in a report last week. • What happens if my VW car has emissions cheating software? • VW emissions scandal: what's it all about? Meanwhile French environment minister Segolene Royal said carmakers must prepare for the day when diesel no longer is used to power vehicles and that the French government was considering ending its tax advantage compared to other types of fuel. \"It’s obvious that it’s necessary to prepare the end of diesel,\" she said during an interview with France 5 television. France is part of a long list of countries investigating VW, including the UK, Canada, the US, Switzerland, Australia and South Korea, as well as several individual US states. VW could be hit with with as much as $18bn in fines under the Clean Air Act in the US and is already facing more than 190 lawsuits by individual car owners. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:38:24.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
