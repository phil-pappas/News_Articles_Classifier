Heathrow is ready to build – let’s make it happen,” he added.\nLast week, Heathrow published images of what the airport would like with a third runway.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:10:42.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
