The only differences are the venue and the duration—in an airport and for a full month. \n\n“This October marks the first anniversary of the debut of Airport Restaurant Month and we are thrilled to be offering travelers this month-long culinary event again with seasonally-themed menus,” said HMSHost Vice President of Marketing Atousa Ghoreichi. \n\nHMSHost’s executive chef and culinary team have created special menus for Airport Restaurant Month inspired by the essence and aromas of fall. \n\nFeatured for the whole month of October, this seasonal fall menu showcases rich flavors and dishes such as pan roasted Wild Alaska salmon from Copper River Seafoods served at the Anchorage International Airport with maple mustard; grilled chicken breast with fall mushroom ragout; and Berkshire pork tenderloin with caramelized apples, pan jus. \n\nAppetizers and side dishes complement each meal, and wine pairings are recommended to add the perfect touch to round out the combination of flavors. Guests can select their choice entrée, accompanied by several side dishes. \n\nRestaurants at numerous airports will be participating.
