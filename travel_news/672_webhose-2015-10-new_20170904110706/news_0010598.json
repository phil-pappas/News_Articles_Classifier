In addition, exotic traditions, dusty cellars and ancient chateaux , led many to perceive the wine business as stuck in the past.\nThat’s anything but the case. In fact, there are a growing number of apps out there that are helping to demystify the process of identifying a wine, and are tapping into a fast growing demographic of mobile-centric customers.\nBy making it easier to understand wine and visit wine-related event they encourage wine enthusiasts, and the same time set an interesting example for other specialty tourism businesses.\nAt the premier cru end of the market there are apps like Delectable and Vivino , which recognise a wine just by pointing the phone’s camera at the label.\nAnother app, Plonk , as the name might suggest is aimed at the less experienced wine drinker and although it doesn’t scan wine labels or recognise the wine, it will help with pronunciation.\nWhile these apps are for home use, preferably in a cellar, or perhaps furtively in a restaurant, there are a growing number that meet at the crossroads between tourism and the passion for wine drinking. Among these are apps like: Winery Finder , Winery Passport and Corksharing .\nUsing geo-location features with a database of wineries, users are steered towards opportunities to visit nearby vineyards or wine tasting events.\nMost originate in California with a focus on US establishments, though some, like Corksharing, extend coverage to other wine producing countries such as the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia, France, Spain and Italy.\nThe Corksharing experience\nBryan Petro, CEO & Founder at Corksharing says their aim is to give wine lovers a new way to explore wine regions.\nHere are three examples:\nWine tasting in a submarine on Treasure Island, CA Wine Tasting at the Vampire Lounge Explore the Wine Cellars of Tuscany Not only does Corksharing’s app and website allow users to search and plan for trips to wineries or wine tasting events, it also facilitates reservations.\n“What makes it different from typical restaurant booking apps like OpenTable is that you can pay in advance, which can be especially useful for business users,” says Petro. It will also create a QR-coded ticket stored in the phone that can be scanned on arrival for a completely paperless experience – just like electronic boarding passes at airports.\nCorkSharing’s business model is to take small percentage of each reservation fee. “There are no subscriptions and the app is free. We feel that no customer should pay if they don’t get business”, says Petro, who believes this “is ethical business at it’s best”.\nInitially the company reached out to wineries to sign them up, but now there is also an interface for entering all relevant information. Having said that, a team is available to lend a hand if a winery needs help.", "external_links": ["http://eyefortraveldrupalfs.s3.amazonaws.com/oct_1_image_1.png", "https://corksharing.com/wine-tasting/ca/sf/sottomarino-flight-1409", "https://corksharing.com/wine-tasting/california/beverly-hills/wine-tasting-at-vampire-lounge-425", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/delectable-wines-wine-scanner/id512106648?mt=8", "http://eyefortraveldrupalfs.s3.amazonaws.com/oct_1_image_2.png", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/winery-passport-wine-wineries/id642211245?mt=8", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vivino-wine-scanner/id414461255?mt=8", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/plonk/id644898155?mt=8", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corksharing/id944234881?mt=8", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/winery-finder-instantly-find/id419570092?mt=8"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:58:19.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
