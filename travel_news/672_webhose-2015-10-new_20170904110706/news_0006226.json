It will be the first Wyndham branded resort in Barbados. \n\"The famous buccaneer Sam Lord settled in this area for its beauty and mystique. Today, we believe he selected the perfect location for our continued growth in the Caribbean,\" said Paulo Pena, president and managing director, Latin America and the Caribbean for Wyndham Hotel Group. \nSam Lord's Castle Barbados, A Wyndham Grand Resort will be situated along the gorgeous beaches of Long Bay by Sam Lord's Castle. The site was a beautiful Georgian mansion built in 1820 by Samuel Hall Lord, known as 'Sam Lord'. It is said that the notorious buccaneer used to hang lanterns on palm trees to attract merchant ships whose captains mistakenly thought the place was a safe harbor. \nWhen it opens in 2018, the hotel will be Wyndham Hotel Group's 13th property in the Caribbean.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:40:49.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
