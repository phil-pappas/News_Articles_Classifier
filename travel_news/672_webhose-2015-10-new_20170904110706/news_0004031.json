Cue sharp intakes of breath from my female colleagues. “Wait until you have a baby, Emma, then you’ll see,” they advise darkly, appalled at my stance. Meanwhile, a male friend chimes in: “You try telling that to my pregnant wife.” ?It has to be concluded that there is no ?safe? limit for alcohol consumption during pregnancy\" Photo: Alamy But here’s the thing – I won’t waver on this. There’s not much I can say with certainty in this life but if I am lucky enough to have a child of my own, I won’t touch a drop (and yes, I am allowed an opinion on this, despite being child-free). Which is exactly the advice being given out by two doctors writing in the new edition of the British Medical Journal . They say there is no evidence of a safe threshold of alcohol and that the “only ethical advice that can be given is complete abstinence from alcohol in pregnancy”. This has been the direction of travel for some time in the UK – and it matches the global picture. Health authorities in the US, Canada, Denmark, France, Norway, Israel, Mexico, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and Spain all recommend no alcohol in pregnancy. Zero. Zilch. Not even a teeny-tiny drop of Prosecco. It's just nine months off the sauce. That's it And yet the Department of Health’s official guidance still contains a caveat that muddies the water: if they must drink, women should have no more than one or two units of alcohol (equivalent to one or two small glasses of wine) once or twice a week. Thus thousands of pregnant British women, especially among the middle classes, continue to feel they “deserve” a little glass of something at the end of a hard week. Recently, I experienced the awkward scenario of assuming that a pregnant friend who’d come for dinner wouldn’t want wine. I was wrong. As I poured out the plonk for everyone else, she requested “just a splash”. Duly obliging and embarrassed at my error, I did the English thing: apologised profusely and overcompensated with a massive goblet of the stuff. She necked it. As is her choice. But I would be lying to say I didn’t half find it baffling. My bemusement turned to outright rage last year, when at a party I noticed a friend’s heavily pregnant wife knock back a bottle of lager, followed by two huge glasses of wine. “It’s fine,” she roared beerily. “The baby’s fully formed now!” I felt like smashing the bottle over her head. Not even a drop of Prosecco... Photo: Alamy It’s just nine months. That’s it. I managed two months off the sauce earlier this year for no reason at all – other than to give my sorry organs a breather. Perhaps it’s also to do with timing. I am now at the stage of my life where many of my friends are trying for a baby. And sadly miscarriage statistics being what they are (one in four pregnancies) there have been many painful moments along the way. These women would do anything to be pregnant. Anything. The idea of getting through those first few months even to be in a position to refuse alcohol would be a dream come true to them and no sacrifice at all. This isn’t about judging women unnecessarily – God knows there’s enough of that. Nor is this a feminist or religious issue. This is about scientific facts . And to me the facts are crystal clear. Pregnant women shouldn’t drink, no matter how much they feel it’s their “right”. And just for the record, I’m not some teetotal puritan – I confess I wrote this hungover as hell. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telewonderwomen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:49:45.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
