Boats depart from the Georges Stael landing stage at Katelijnestraat 4 every 30 minutes, daily from 10h00 to 17h30. Closed from the middle of November to the middle of March. \nBruges is known for chocolate, lace, and to a lesser extent diamonds. The diamond museum is at Katelijnestraat 43.

The municipal lace Museum is on the main canal at Dijver 16. \nThe Belfort en Hallen (belltower of the market) is a symbol of Bruges and the tallest belfry in Belgium. Climb the 366 steps to top for a panoramic view of Bruges; on a clear day you'll see all the way out to the sea. \nThe 12th century basilica Heilig-Bloedbasiliek , or chapel of the Holy Blood, on Burg square contains a rock-crystal vial containing a fragment of cloth stained with what is said to be the coagulated blood of Christ. They bring it out on Fridays for veneration, but if that's not your thing the basilica is still worth a visit. On Ascension Day the relic becomes the focus of the Procession of the Holy Blood , in which 1,500 Bruges citizens, many in medieval garb, form a mile-long procession behind the relic. \nYou probably don't think of visiting sites of early public housing on your vacation, but Bruges has a considerable number of whitewashed almshouses , many clustered around a cozy inner courtyard. They were popular ways of currying favor with God in the 14th century by wealthy townspeople or guilds and than 46 blocks of these have been preserved. \nBruges is a great walking town (or you can rent bicycles and go around like natives). The cuisine is top notch (although a tad expensive), and the beer is some of the best in the world (try the Brewery De Gouden Boom at Langestraat, 47 which has a small but interesting museum). \nLike old-time motorcycles? You can see more than 80 motorcycles, mopeds and scooters at the Oldtimer Motorcycle Museum in Oudenburg (Close to Ostend).
