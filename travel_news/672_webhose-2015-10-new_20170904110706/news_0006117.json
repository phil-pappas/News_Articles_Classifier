The official dates are September 19 to October 4, but in Munich, who's counting?\nYes, Munich is still the epicenter of Oktoberfest, and seats are available. For late September going, early October return, I found nonstop fares from Boston at around $1,400 and from San Francisco at around $1,500, but, as is so often the case these days, a connecting itinerary can often cut the cost substantially. A relatively tight connection itinerary on Aer Lingus from Boston or San Francisco through Dublin, for example, cuts the cost by almost $400. And I saw a few even cheaper routings through Moscow or Kiev -- those eastern airlines are really hurting. Hotel prices in Munich are up, but you can usually find good deals in outlying areas with good transportation to and from the city center.\nGiven just about any destination's penchant for cooking up year-round \"events\" to lure visitors, you shouldn't be surprised to see Oktoberfests of varying authenticity throughout the United States and Canada. I've seen three different centers listed as \"biggest outside of Munich:\"\n-- New Braunfels, Texas, between Austin and San Antonio, often gets the nod. The settlement was established in 1845 by Prince Carl of Solms-Braunfels and developed to attract German immigrants. And if you miss Oktoberfest, the city celebrates \"Wurstfest\" in November.\n-- Cincinnati is a recognized center of German-American culture: After all, residents are known as \"Rheinlanders.\"\n-- Kitchener-Waterloo, about 90 miles southwest of Toronto, runs events through mid-October, with a few continuing through the end of the month.\nOther cities that show up on various Oktoberfest events lists include Addison, Texas; Appleton, Wisconsin; Atlanta; Big Bear Lake, California; Boston; Chicago; Breckenridge, Colorado; Cleveland; Denver; Frankenmuth, Michigan; Fredericksburg, Texas; Fremont, Washington; Helen, Georgia; Hickory, North Carolina; La Crosse, Wisconsin; Leavenworth, Washington; Los Angeles; Mount Angel, Oregon; New Orleans; Phoenix; Pittsburgh; Reno/Tahoe; San Francisco; St Louis; Toronto; and Washington, D.C. Even such unlikely venues as Alyeska, Alaska, and Honolulu get mentioned. And if you happen to be on a foreign trip somewhere other than Germany, one source lists Brisbane, Australia, and claims Hong Kong's Marco Polo German Bierfest as \"The best Oktoberfest in Asia.\"\nRaise your glass and enjoy the annual German festival from afar. The 2015 festival runs from Sept. 19-Oct. 4 and draws millions from around the globe for the world's largest beer festival.\nThe last time I covered Oktoberfest, I noted some surprise at the absence of Milwaukee, a city with a strong history of German cuisine and beer. Still, Milwaukee is a good place to visit any time of the year; it's iconic Milwaukee Brat House, Old German Beer Hall, Karl Ratzch's, and Mader's are still going strong. My main quibble with lack of authenticity is that, for a variety of reasons, most of them valid, the \"schnitzels\" you encounter these days are mainly either pork or chicken rather than the traditional veal. But if you're serving pork, why not call it \"Schweinschnitzel,\" which it is, rather than \"Wienerschnitzel,\" which it isn't?\nFor a while in the late '90s, German restaurants went into some sort of eclipse, and in New York's Yorkville, once a hotbed of German cuisine, the only remaining traditional name is Heidelberg. Now, the cuisine is making a comeback elsewhere in Manhattan, and, more broadly, throughout the U.S. Especially in the Midwest, you can find a few German restaurants in most good-sized cities. But some of the listed Oktoberfest centers pretty much close up shop after the main event.\nOn balance, as I noted last year, you can't discuss Oktoberfest without honoring Munich at the top of the list. And the nice part of Munich is that you can do the beer, wurst, sauerbraten and schnitzel routine any time of the year. Some folks even prefer to avoid the crowds at Oktoberfest and go during more relaxed off-season times. Don't ever worry that Munich will run out of beer.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins(at)mind.net.
