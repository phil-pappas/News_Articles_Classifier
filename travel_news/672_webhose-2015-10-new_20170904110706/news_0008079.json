Dewayne Bevil Contact Reporter Ticketholders will see new film at Disney Springs, fireworks at Studios \nDisney World is planning a two-pronged \"Star Wars\" celebration, teaming the debut of the upcoming film and a private party at Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park on Dec. 17. \nTicketholders for the special event will watch \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" at the AMC Disney Springs 24 theater and then attend an after-hours party at Hollywood Studios until 2 a.m. The park event will include the new Star Wars Launch Bay exhibit, the Star Tours ride, a dance party and a preview of the fireworks show set to the \"Star Wars\" score. Folks will also get a souvenir ticket. \nTickets will go on sale tonight after the latest trailer for \"The Force Awakens\" during halftime of the Monday Night Football game on ESPN. (Go to amctheatres.com/starwarswdw to buy.) Tickets for the event range between $94.99 and $99.99, depending on the format of film selected. \nDisney's Hollywood Studios eventually will be home to a land dedicated to the \"Star Wars\" franchise. The 14-acre area, announced in August, will be part of the park's makeover that also includes a \"Toy Story\" land. \nThe fine print: Disney will not sell party-only tickets; participants must provide their own transportation between the theater and the party; at the theme park, some merchandise and food outlets will be open, but Disney does not plan to operate other non-\"Star Wars\" attractions that evening; and costumes are encouraged for the event -- with some safety restrictions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:35:28.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
