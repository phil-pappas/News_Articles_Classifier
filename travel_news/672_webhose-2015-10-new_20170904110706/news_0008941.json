The new ship will be based in China year-round beginning in summer 2017 and become the first vessel built specifically for Chinese guests incorporating a unique blend of international and Chinese features.\n\"Royal Princess and Regal Princess were named after iconic previous vessels, while Majestic Princess will carry a name that was chosen by our global employees,\" said Jan Swartz , president of Princess Cruises. \"The name Majestic Princess is well suited to the Princess Cruises experience in China , and she will offer a truly magnificent experience to our Chinese guests,\" added Swartz.\nBefitting her dedication to the Chinese market, Majestic Princess will also carry a Chinese name on the hull, (Shèng Shì Gong Zhu Haò) – an interpretation selected by Carnival plc's China employees, which has the suggestive meaning of \"Grand World\" or \"Grand Spirit.\"\nThe 143,000-ton vessel, Majestic Princess, is being built at the Fincantieri shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy . She will be home-ported in Shanghai , carrying 3,560 guests for cruises to Japan and Korea, and will offer many of the special features that have made Royal Princess and Regal Princess so popular and distinctive. These include a dramatic multi-story atrium serving as the social hub of the ship; the unique over-the-ocean SeaWalk - a glass-floor walkway extending 8 meters (28 feet) beyond the edge of the ship; the Princess Live! interactive studio; and the special Chef's Table Lumiere, a private dining experience that surrounds guests in a curtain of light.\n\"We're excited that Shanghai will be welcoming this newest, most advanced addition to the Princess fleet, as it represents our brand's long-term commitment to the continuing growth of the China market,\" said Swartz.\nMajestic Princess will offer the international flavor of cruising with Princess, drawn from the brand's award-winning expertise as the world's leader in premium destination cruising. The cruise ship's cuisine will span the globe, serving authentic dishes from Italy , France , North and South America , Southeast Asia , Japan and China – all freshly prepared onboard. Guests will enjoy a festival celebrating dance, music and crafts of exotic cultures; an array of international guest entertainers; and Las Vegas-style production shows starring a cast of singers and dancers from around the world.\n\"Every day, around the world, our guests create lifelong memories from authentic experiences while enjoying freshly made cuisine designed to bring each destination to life,\" added Swartz. \"Majestic Princess will allow us to bring the best the world has to offer to more Chinese guests, for an unparalleled premium and international vacation, inspired by our passion for the many places we sail.\"\nLike all Princess cruises in China , Majestic Princess will showcase the brand's exclusive Princess Class experience, designed specifically for the Chinese market. Delivered by the ship's extensively trained international crew, these Princess Class enhancements enrich the travel experience of each cruise guest: authentic, classic events like the World Leaders Dinner and Traditional English Afternoon Tea; special culinary experiences such as the Lobster Grill, Ultimate Balcony Dining, and an ocean-view hot pot dinner option; and an unparalleled duty-free shopping experience, featuring leading designer brands.\nThe cruise ship will also offer Princess' signature Movies Under the Stars , with the largest outdoor screen at sea, and the exciting Princess WaterColor Fantasy fountain and light show. Accommodations will be configured to appeal to families and multi-generational travelers; all outside staterooms will have private balconies.
