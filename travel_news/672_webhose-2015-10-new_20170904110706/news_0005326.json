Inside, images from the movie and snowflake decals feature prominently on overhead bins, bulkheads, lavatory mirrors and headrests. Onboard, guests will be able to watch a selection of on-demand Disney videos.\n\"This aircraft takes the relationship between WestJet and Disney to a completely new level of cool,\" Bob Cummings , WestJet Executive Vice-President said in a statement. \"Two years ago, we launched the #MagicPlane, our first Disney-themed aircraft, and no matter where it flies throughout our network, it is the most-anticipated and most-photographed aircraft in WestJet history.”\nAnd if that doesn't get you revved up, the first of three Star Wars themed aircrafts from Japanese airline, All Nippon Airways (ANA) took to the sky this past weekend from Tokyo to Vancouver and back.\nANA who serves purple ice-cream, sushi, prawns and cheeseburgers is in the front line of fun innovative flying. The exterior of the plane, painted to resemble the droid R2-D2, flew over Tokyo’s Haneda Airport, while Star Wars fans, clothed in the finest outer space gear enjoyed every minute.\nMore on this...
