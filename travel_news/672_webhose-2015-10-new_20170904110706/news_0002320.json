On that day, thousands of people across the country head out to their favorite trail to enjoy a good walk in the woods, while taking the opportunity to reconnect with nature along the way. Others donate their time to help build new trails, or provide maintenance on those that already exist. It is a chance for hikers, bikers, horseback riders, paddlers, and others to show their appreciation for the more than 200,000 miles of recreational trails that are available across the U.S., a resource that few other countries can come close to matching. \nSome of the absolute best hiking trails are found inside America's national parks of course, many of which are tailor made for exploring on foot. With so many trails to choose from, it is difficult to pick which ones are the very best. But here are 10 hikes that every outdoor enthusiasts should have on their national park bucket list. \nBright Angel Trail - Grand Canyon (Arizona) Grand Canyon National Park is home to one of the most classic hikes in all of North America. The 12-mile roundtrip walk along Bright Angel Trail provides stunning views of the canyon, and the surrounding landscape, which is amongst the most iconic and well known in the entire world. The walk can be a strenuous one at times, but it is also a very rewarding one. \nNavajo Loop - Bryce Canyon (Utah)Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park offers some of the most unique landscapes that you'll find anywhere, and one of the best trails to explore that environment on is the 3-mile long Navajo Loop. Starting at Sunset Point and running out to place called the \"main amphitheater,\" this trail takes hikers past some of the more scenic elements in the entire park. Beware of falling rocks though, as it can be a bit treacherous at times. \nSargent Mountain Loop - Acadia National Park (Maine)As one of the preeminent wilderness areas in the eastern United States, Acadia National Park is a wonderful escape for many hikers. One of the top trekking routes found there is the Sargent Mountain Loop, a 5.5 mile round-trip walk that takes visitors to the top of 1373-foot Sargent Mountain, one of the main landmarks in the park. At the summit you'll find outstanding views of the Acadia coastline, as well as the lush forests of spruce and fir below. \nJohn Muir Trail - Multiple Parks (California)In terms of sheer beauty, few trails can match the John Muir Trail, which passes through Yosemite , Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Parks along its 211 mile route. The path, which is actually part of the much larger Pacific Crest Trail , offers numerous day hikes, or can be tackled end-to-end for a true backcountry adventure in the High Sierra mountains. Breathtaking vistas, crystal clear streams, and peaceful solitude are the norm here. \nGrinnell Glacier Trail - Glacier National Park (Montana)Montana is a state filled with beautiful scenery, but Glacier National Park just might encompass the absolute best of all.

This trail is only open from July to September, but it is a grand walk none the less. \nHawksbill Loop Trail - Shenandoah National Park (Virginia)At just 3 miles in length, the Hawksbill Loop Trail in Virginia's Shenandoah National Park may not seem very long, but it packs plenty of punch.

Surprisingly, there is plenty of wildlife to spot on Isle Royal, including moose, deer, and wolves. The hike is a scenic one too, often offering prime views of the Lake Superior shoreline along the way. \nGuadalupe Peak Trail - Guadalupe Mountains National Park (Texas)Texas is well known for its dry desert landscapes in the west, thick forests in the east, and rolling hill country in the center.
