Quote: Chances are, you've already done it. You're at the airport, checked in and excited to be going on your plane journey to a new destination. So you snap a photo of your boarding pass, with your flight number and destination listed, and share it with your friends and followers on social media. If you're really lucky, you might be bragging about your seat number if it's particularly low. 1A means you're in the best seat in the plane, in either first or business class, but generally speaking a low number on your boarding pass is worth bragging about. But you should think twice before posting that photo online, a security expert warns. Btw, as If all the stupid selfies are not enough, who would take photos of boarding pass and post online for bragging...?
