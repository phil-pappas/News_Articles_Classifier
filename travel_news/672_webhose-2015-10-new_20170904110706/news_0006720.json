This region, to the north of the state of Jammu and Kashmir is home to incredible sights and amazing monuments. From monasteries to palaces, forts to museums, there are a number of great attractions that you can visit here. Leh, which is the capital of the region, is always the starting point for any tours in Ladakh. Most of the famous tourist attractions in Ladakh such as Tsemo Fort, Leh Palace, War Museum, etc. can be found in or at a short distance from the city. Of these, one of the most popular is the Shanti Stupa at Changspa. This famous monument was erected in 1991 by a Japanese Buddhist organisation called 'The Japanese for World Peace'. The Shanti Stupa was built to commemorate 2,500 years of Buddhism and to promote world peace. The stupa, which stands on a hill overlooking the village of Changspa has a two-level structure. These two levels of the Stupa are laden with symbolism about dharma and Lord Buddha's life and teachings. Here is short explanation of the different symbols you can find on each level: Dharmachakra:The Dharmachakra or 'Wheel of Dharma' can be found on the first level. This symbol has been used since the early period of Indian Buddhism. It is also called the 'Wheel of Law'. It represents Lord Buddha's teaching of the path to enlightenment. Apart from Buddhism, a symbol similar to the Dhramachakra is also used in Jainism. Relief of Buddha Defeating Devils:This relief that depicts Lord Buddha defeating the devils while meditating can be found on the second level. The devils in the relief refer to the attractions of the material world and to human desire. Through meditation, Lord Budhha was able to overcome his desires and spurn the trappings of material possessions. Relief of Buddha Attaining Parinirvana:The relief that depicts the death of Lord Buddha represents his attainment of parinirvana. Parinirvana is a concept that refers to nirvana-after-death. This occurs on the body of someone who has attained nirvana during their life. On attaining parinirvana, the soul is released from 'samsara', 'karma'and 'skandas'. There are a lot of other reliefs that you can find on the second level of the Shanti Stupa. However, they are generally straightforward and depict different events in Lord Buddha's life. The most significant of all the reliefs in the Shanti Stupa in Leh are the Dharmachakra, relief of Lord Buddha defeating the devils and that of Lord Buddha's death or parinirvana.
