Available from February to June, when the Flying Scotsman exhibition will be taking place, the package is available to any company hiring the Great Hall for dinner and capitalises on the trend for providing an immersive and interactive event experience for guests. \nNeil Ormondroyd, Group Sales Manager, said: “We are thrilled to be able to welcome the iconic Flying Scotsman to the National Railway Museum in February next year. The famous locomotive is a national treasure, which we hope delegates will take great pleasure in seeing up close with the help of our new corporate event packages. “The Flying Scotsman’s return to the tracks will take place in February when it makes its inaugural run from London Kings Cross station to York where it will arrive at the National Railway Museum. The train will be in situ at the museum from 25 March to 8 May, with additional activities taking place including a Flying Scotsman exhibition and photography events. We are pleased to be able to extend this unique opportunity to celebrate the famous locomotive to our corporate clients.” The Flying Scotsman exhibition will explore the big questions relating to the fame of the world’s most famous locomotive and route, as well as the highs and lows of its rollercoaster career. Based on a minimum number of 50 guests, the themed events package costs £85 incl VAT per person and includes exclusive use of the Great Hall, a welcome drink on arrival, a Flying Scotsman themed three-course dinner menu and photo opportunities around the famous locomotive, which will be situated at the NRM from 25 March to 8 May 2016.
