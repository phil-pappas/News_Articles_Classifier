The two airlines will together operate twice daily services and manage the route jointly. This replacement will take effect from 16 January 2016. Tigerair will also operate additional services on certain dates during the Chinese New Year 2016 period.\nScoot’s CEO, Mr Campbell Wilson, said, “Guangzhou will be Scoot’s sixth destination in China and second in the Pearl River Delta area after Hong Kong. Complementing Tigerair’s existing services, which also include Shenzhen and Macau, travellers to and from this region now have more choice, more connections and the opportunity to travel on our brand-new 787 Dreamliners – featuring inflight connectivity, in-seat power, revamped ScooTV, a wide range of customisation options and, of course, service with Scootitude.”\nContinued Mr Lee Lik Hsin, CEO of Tigerair, “With Scoot operating one tranche of Tigerair service to Guangzhou with their larger aircraft, we jointly serve the market more efficiently. We are also finalising a similar arrangement for another route. The partnership agreements on these routes are structured to ensure win-win for both sides, and Tigerair can also redeploy resources for expansion to new destinations.”\nGuangzhou is the third largest city in China – a bustling metropolis that is the business and cultural hub of southern China. With close proximity to the South China Sea, Hong Kong and Macau, it is often called the “South Gate of China” and is a key entry.\nSource:- Tigerair", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:14:35.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
