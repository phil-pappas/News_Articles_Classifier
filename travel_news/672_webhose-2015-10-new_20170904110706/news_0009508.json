Signing this agreement with MEXICO 2 , means that Aeromexico has adopted the International Aviation Transport Association (IATA) guidelines to offset carbon emissions, based on the commitment set in 2005 for carbon-neutral growth by 2020 with 50% reduction by 2050 relative to 2005 levels,\" said MEXICO 2 director Eduardo Piquero .\nIn signing this agreement, Aeromexico, and its passengers join one of the best international practices for environmental protection offsetting part of their annual air emissions. A percentage of the sum collected will be provided directly by the airline with another amount supplied by its customers. The full amount will be used to acquire carbon credits from renewable energy and methane capture projects through MEXICO 2 .\n\"The acquisition of carbon credits represents an excellent opportunity for us to contribute to the fight against climate change, as part of our concern for environmental protection. As the leading airline in the Mexican aviation industry, Aeromexico is fully committed to participating in actions that produce a positive impact on the environment,\" said the airline's CHRO Sergio Allard.\nOffsetting emissions by buying carbon credits is just one of the actions listed in the reorganization document for Aeromexico's \"Fly Green\" program launched in November 2013 . Its primary objective is to raise environmental awareness and reduce CO 2 emissions while offering customers a new way to travel by reducing the environmental impact of flying.\nIn addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), our investment in carbon credits supports the reuse of Mexico's natural resources and the sustainable development of its economy as this encourages innovation and motivates companies to care for our planet.\nMexico's financial exchange, Bolsa Mexican de Valores (Grupo BMV) and the Mexico Carbon Platform, MEXICO 2 , recognize that Aeromexico is a company committed to the fight against climate change, and interested in preserving best practices and engaging its customers in this effort that involves us all.\nAbout MEXICO 2\nThe Mexico Carbon Platform, MEXICO 2 , is an initiative that responds to the needs of the country in the face of climate change. It proposes an efficient mechanism that helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions by supporting projects intended to protect and increase the country's natural and social resources. MEXICO 2 is the first effort in the creation of a voluntary carbon market that supports the transition of Mexico and its business corporations towards a greener economy. MEXICO 2 was created as a market initiative collectively sponsored by the Mexican Stock Exchange and SIF ICAP, the British Embassy in Mexico , the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR), and the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC).
