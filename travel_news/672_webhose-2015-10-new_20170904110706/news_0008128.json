This recognition follows two more accolades – Heathrow was shortlisted for the best in passenger transport by the inaugural National Air Quality Awards and is shortlisted for the Energy Management Award in the forthcoming Edies’ Sustainability Leaders Awards.\nMatt Gorman, Heathrow Director of Sustainability and Environment said:\n“We are honoured to receive these awards, particularly as they recognise the work that we have done in the past few years to improve Heathrow’s air quality and reduce our emissions but we are committed to doing more to be a good neighbour. Even with expansion, we can meet air quality limits, and carbon targets, and ensure a bigger Heathrow can be better neighbour.”\n“Road traffic, particularly in the M4 and M25 junctions around the airport continues to be the greatest contributor to poor air quality, but the majority of this – over 80% – is not airport-related. While we have been recognised for making progress, and plans for transformational public transport will change the way many people travel to and from the airport, we cannot solve the air quality problems in West London without the collaboration of City Hall and the Government.”\nHeathrow’s multi-million pound investments in electric vehicle infrastructure, technology to reduce aircraft emissions, and public transport options have all already played a key part in reducing emissions around the airport by 16% over five years. In the future, the airport has plans in place to cut emissions even further, including by investing £5 million so that every car or small van owned or leased is electric or plug-in hybrid by 2020. This initiative on its own could reduce up to 100 tonnes of nitrogen oxide emissions each year from our airside fleet alone.\nHeathrow will continue to ensure passengers have a range of options to travel sustainably to the airport, and increase the amount of people travelling to the airport by public transport to over 45%. Heathrow is already the best connected airport by road, rail and air – and with expansion it could be at the heart of an integrated transport hub. New upgrades like Crossrail, Southern and Western Rail Access, links to HS2 and an expanded bus and coach station will help ensure there is no more airport-related traffic on the roads around the airport compared to today.\nThe GreenFleet, Air Quality News and Edie awards and nominations follow other notable Heathrow recognitions in sustainability this year, including the airport’s 8 th Biodiversity Benchmark Award and the ACI’s Eco-Innovation Award.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:37:29.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
