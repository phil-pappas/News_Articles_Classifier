Many developing nations that are now experiencing rapid tourism growth have agrarian societies and tourism is the first or second source of export earnings.\nThe main objective of this report is to enhance the understanding of linkages between these two sectors, as well as propose suggestions for how they could be strengthened with the aim of promoting bottom-up sustainable development in the United Republic of Tanzania.\nIn Brief\n20 out of the worldâ€™s 48 least developed countries (LDCs) rely on tourism and agriculture as the basis for the livelihoods of most of their inhabitants. On average, international tourists stay about 10 days in the country, spending a total of US$1,691 per visitor.\nThe report notes the lodging, food and beverage sectors together account for about 20 per cent of tourism-related income in the country. This represents a large opportunity for pro-poor businesses because organic agricultural products are in high demand by tourists and often provide price-premiums to producers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:08:11.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
