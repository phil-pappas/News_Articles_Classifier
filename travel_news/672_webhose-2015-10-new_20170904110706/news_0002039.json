That's why several new sessions at The Work Truck Show ® 2016 will demonstrate how to best utilize fleet performance and maintenance metrics.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278171\nThe Work Truck Show, North America's largest work truck event, is produced annually by NTEA – The Association for the Work Truck Industry. The 2016 Show will be held March 1–4 at the Indiana Convention Center in Indianapolis, Indiana . Educational sessions and the Green Truck Summit begin March 1 , and exhibits open March 2 .\n\"The right data can help fleet operators enhance productivity, control costs, maximize investments and stay ahead of the competition,\" says Steve Carey , NTEA executive director. \"But for the best results, you have to know what data is critical and how to leverage it for each fleet's specific needs. At The Work Truck Show 2016, attendees can find answers to these types of questions and learn effective strategies for improving fleet operations.\"\nOne of the new numbers-driven Work Truck Show sessions is \"Acquiring and Using Fleet Data: What You Can Learn From Your Equipment.\" Presented by the Indiana Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP), this course shows how truck data loggers can be used to predict component failures and limit unexpected vehicle downtime. The practice of using information to develop a proactive truck maintenance program will further be discussed at \"Maintenance and Repair Shop Management.\" This two-part session can help fleets with in-house maintenance operations measure service technician performance, parts management and facility usage efficiency.\nAt the updated \"Fleet Management 101: Fundamentals of Truck Fleet Management\" seminar, attendees can learn how to use information systems and analytical tools for benchmarking. This immersive session also covers fleet performance measurements and shows how to determine total cost of ownership for each vehicle.\nAfter discovering new ways to apply data to improve current operations, fleet managers can prepare for the future by attending update sessions presented by 14 leading work truck OEMs. At these sessions, chassis manufacturer representatives will discuss vehicle updates and answer technical questions. The Work Truck Show 2016 will also provide attendees with the unique opportunity to discuss equipment updates with exhibitors' product engineers and get their regulatory questions answered by NTEA experts.\nThe Work Truck Show, recently named one of the top 100 trade shows in the U.S., brings together more than 11,000 truck fleet managers, dealers and equipment distributors annually.
