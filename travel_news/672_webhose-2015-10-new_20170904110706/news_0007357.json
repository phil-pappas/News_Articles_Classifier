That's where it became the malodorous marathon.\n\"It pretty much smelled,\" said Eric Hubbard, who has run all six Rock 'n' Roll Denver marathons but won't get to run another one because race organizers can't live with the restrictions the city has put on them. \"Smelled like sewer from about (mile) 11 to 18 or 20, and that was kind of brutal.\"\nMarathoners also had to run much of the race on a concrete bike path. While it might be hard for nonrunners to believe, concrete is much harder on the legs of a runner than asphalt.\n\"The last four miles for me were pretty tough,\" said Stephen VanGampleare of Colorado Springs, 25, who won the marathon in 2 hours, 43 minutes, 51 seconds. \"I don't know if that had mostly to do with the concrete or if that was mostly because of me trying to pick up the pace a little more to make sure I had big enough gap behind me.\"\nWomen's winner Anne Staeheli of Denver, 27, said the concrete bothered her.\n\"We were on a bike path from about mile 6, pretty much the entire way,\" said Staeheli, who finished in 3:14.21. \"I was feeling it in my hips.\"\nAdvertisement Staehli said there was a scenic aspect to the miles along the Platte, despite the odor.\n\"Beautiful,\" said Staeheli, who won the women's race by more than 10 minutes. \"There's water out there, so that's kind of refreshing. There were enough turns to keep you busy, and your mind off of it.\"\nRace officials and the city were at an impasse, so there won't be a marathon next year. There will be a half marathon. While the Denver-Boulder area is one of the world's hotbeds of running, Denver will have only one marathon, the Colfax Marathon in May.\n\"Kind of unfortunate, especially in a state like Colorado,\" VanGampleare said. \"That's kind of what we're known for: People that like to get outside and be active. That's too bad.\"\nThe demise of this marathon bothers Hubbard, too.\n\"I think something needs to replace it,\" Hubbard said. \"I think Denver really needs a spring marathon and a fall marathon. It is disappointing to lose a fall marathon.\"\nMarathons also manufacture inspiration, and there was lots of that Sunday. Dylan Batz, a developmentally disabled 22-year-old who has a passion for running and fitness, finished his first marathon in 3:39:50.\n\"It was tough at the end, those few last miles, but I toughed through it,\" Batz said, adding that his legs were \"a little bit shooken up, but all right.\"\nBraun wins half marathon Aaron Braun of Fort Collins, a 28-year-old graduate of the powerhouse Division II cross country and track program at Adams State, won the half marathon in 1:07:15, edging Colorado School of Mines runner Phil Schneider by 28 seconds.\n\"We ran together until about 9&frac12; (miles) or so,\" said Braun, who is training for the Olympic Marathon trials in Los Angeles in February. \"I just tried to run controlled, get a good effort in. Still pretty early in my season. It was fun.\"\nStevie Kremer of Crested Butte won the women's half in 1:20.57.\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:07:16.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
