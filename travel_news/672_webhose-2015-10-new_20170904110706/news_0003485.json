You'll have fun on any kind of Grand Canyon tour, but none are as exciting as soaring above the massive landmark in a helicopter. These tours fly all seasons of the year, and you can pick and choose different upgrades to create a tour package of your dreams. Get Going! The helicopter tours take off from the airport in Tusayan, Arizona near the South Rim and from airfields around Las Vegas. While you can take air and land tours at the South Rim, if you want to take a helicopter flight down to the canyon floor, you'll have to take a Vegas flight to the West Rim, because the West Rim is the only part of the canyon where flying below the rim is allowed. The National Park Service has banned flight below the South Rim because of noise restrictions. Vegas Voyage! When you take a flight out of Vegas, your sightseeing tour starts right away. In addition to seeing the canyon from the air, you'll get an aerial view of Lake Mead and the Colorado River as well as other scenic landmarks during your flight. Landing tours fly to the bottom of the canyon, the top or a combination of both. A fun tour to consider is the one that flies you down to the canyon floor where a champagne picnic awaits. Another tour upgrade to consider is a fun 11-mile floating tour through the canyon on the Colorado River. This rafting tour starts at the base of the Hoover Dam and wends its way through the dark rocks of Black Canyon. The raft ends its journey in the tranquil waters of Willow Beach. Here you'll find a welcoming oasis that's the perfect spot for a relaxing dip in the cool waters of the river. This tour departs early morning once a day. South Rim Air Tours The South Rim is known for its spectacular panoramic views from the air. You can choose from two flights depending on the amount of money and time you have. One flight lasts about 30 minutes and flies over the North Rim and circles back. The 50-minute tour, goes from rim to rim, but also includes views of up to 75% of the entire Park. Another tour option is to take the 30 minute helicopter flight and combine it with a Jeep tour of the park. This combo visits the most recognized stops in the park and gives the best canyon experience. At Mather Point, you see the canyon stretch out in brilliant colors for miles. The path the Colorado has cut through the canyon will be on full display at Yavapai Point. You'll even get to take a break at historic Grand Canyon Village where you can step back in time, shop, or dine. This is one of the best tours you can take at the South Rim because you get to see so much of the canyon. Which Way To Fly? The basic or deluxe tour type depends on the helicopter used. The basic tours fly on A Star choppers or Bell Rangers. They are okay for flying, however, they are noisy and there isn't very good climate control in them. Deluxe tours fly on the EcoStar 130 chopper that has climate control, deluxe seats arranged stadium-style, and roomy cabins that are 25 percent bigger than basic helicopters. In addition, the EcoStar is a lot quieter and gives you a smoother ride. Perhaps the best benefit of all is the huge panoramic windshield that offers the best viewing possible from the air. Many Helicopter Options You can see there is no shortage of options when it comes to choosing a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon. Hopefully, this article has narrowed the choices down. Deluxe flights are the way to go since they come with great perks and offer a more comfortable flight. I personally recommend the Las Vegas Champagne picnic tour or the South Rim tour that includes access to a Jeep tour. Since all helicopter tours are popular, they sell out fast, so be sure to book your trip early and do it online so it won't be sold out. \nGrand Canyon expert Lea Fallon is a huge fan of helicopter tours and recommends these helicopter tour reviews plus this page so you can get deals that make these flights cheaper: http://grandcanyonhelicopter.org/grand-canyon-helicopter-tour-coupons.html   10   11  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:06:59.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
