Could not subscribe, try again later Share LinkedIn The fire broke out at Wey Farm near Fairoaks Airport \nFire crews were called to a warehouse blaze near Fairoaks Airport in Chobham on Wednesday, which sent a vast plume of black smoke spiralling into the air shortly before midday. \nSurrey Fire and Rescue Service received a call at 11.31am to an incident near Wey Farm, to the east of the airport in Chertsey Road. \nThe site comprises of Wey Farm Outdoors, Dragon Fireworks and Wey Farm Boarding Kennels and Cattery. \nRebecca Davis, who works at Wey Farm, said: \"It [the fire] was in the old workshops behind the kennels - but it's miles behind. \n\"We saw some black smoke rising up and we could hear paint pots going pop.\" \nMs Davis said the fire was in an old warehouse near the site, not at Wey Farm itself. She added none of the businesses were affected, and all 30 dogs and five cats on site were absolutely fine. \nPeter Green from High Level Photography, which is based at Fairoaks Airport, said: \"[We] saw it at around 11.30am. \n\"There was a lot of black smoke, but it wasn't in the airport grounds. Now it's just steam, so I assume it's all been put out.\" \nCrews from Woking, Chobham and Camberley fire stations attended the incident. \nA Surrey and Fire Rescue Service spokesperson said: \"It was in an outbuilding. A bit of it collapsed. \n\"I think the guy was welding in there and it caught alight. \n\"About 25% of the workshop was damaged and an outbuilding. \n\"It was about 50 metres long, so it was quite a proportion of it. \n\"We stopped it from spreading onto the log pile, which is pretty much his livelihood. \n\"Luckily the guy had a digger so he managed to move a lot of the logs.\" \nIt was the second time this month that emergency services were called out to the Fairoaks area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:26:18.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
