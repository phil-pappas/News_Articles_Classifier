The performance last week against Samoa with all or nothing to play for, and especially Greig Laidlaw 's individual performance, was outstanding. Getting 24 points himself and the try at the end to guarantee a place in the quarter-finals epitomised what our leader from Jed-Forest is all about. Greig has always been coolness personified. Samoa didn't have anything to lose and they were throwing everything at us. Greig's leadership was tremendous. He would return to the arms of the community a conquering hero if Scotland were to beat Australia on Sunday, and reach the last four. Once you're on a roll, anything can happen. Australia are the team on form at the moment. They had a great performance against England and Wales ands we've got to perform well to beat them. Back in 1983, Greig's uncle Roy Laidlaw, also a scrum-half, was part of a great side who had a match never to forget. I remember it well. We'd never beaten the All Blacks and that was the closest we've got when it was 25-25 that day. Roy put in a tremendous performance that day. He was only 5ft 6ins tall and 11st. Greig showed a lot of the same qualities uncle Roy did, last week. Roy had that same tenaciousness in his game. Greig is at his peak at the present moment, and obviously celebrated his 30th birthday this week, and the experience he's gained means he's playing some of the best rugby of his career right now. Greig has got the best percentage at the moment in goal-kicking in this Rugby World Cup, too. It means he can always keep us in the game. Scotland didn't panic against Samoa, and that is often down to the core leaders upon the pitch. They were pretty cool in a difficult situation. We were always in the game and you've got players like Tommy Seymour who are scoring well and taking every opportunity. We struggled a bit defensively in the first half and were under pressure, but we didn't panic and in the second half we gained control of the game. And then Greig's goal-kicking and his try between the sticks helped us. Greig's best man, Gary Hughes, is flying down on the Sunday morning with his girlfriend, and Greig's immediate family. It's a big day. When things are going wrong, Greig really speaks well, too. He can rally people around him. I remember listening to Greig when they were down to 13 men and he was tremendous. He's got that calming influence. He's got an understanding of what they've got to do and he tells them what to do. He's also got the respect of the players. Australia will be a huge test. I think after them beating England and Wales they've given themselves that mantle of potential winners of this Rugby World Cup. They've had a few injuries and some key players who have maybe not been playing. But Michael Hooper is coming back and it's going to be a real tough test. The technology has been spot-on in the scoring of tries in this Rugby World Cup. But on the foul play, it's not as consistent. I thought the decisions to give bans to Scotland players Ross Ford and Jonny Gray were harsh. I know we want to make the game safer but it still is a contact sport. You've got to take the maliciousness out of it, but are we going over the top? I suppose the IRFU set their stall out when they sent off Sam Warburton for Wales in the semi-final of the last World Cup. That's kind of set the standard. But the referee dealt with that on the field and gave Warburton a red card. Again, was it a red card or not? For me, personally, it was a yellow. He seems to be really enjoying it. All those who know him, and have supported him, certainly are You've got to take every game as it comes, but you've also got to think about the tournament and you don't want the best players missing games. Scotland has achieved what it set out to do. I think they're the lowest ranked team in the final eight. After the Six Nations it was a bit doom and gloom, but it has lifted the whole of Scotland, and the Scottish rugby community in the last few weeks. This is a huge game for us. We're into the quarter finals and we're achieving something, and we just have our fingers crossed now and hope we can get over that next hurdle. Greig knows he will be a target for Australia in this game. He's captain, has his hands on the ball all the time at No 9, and is kicking the goals. You always try to put the general and leader under pressure. You try to take them out of the game. They say you take the shepherd out and the sheep go all over the place. Their back row will try to put a lot of pressure on Greig, but I think at the moment he is relishing all these challenges. He seems to be really enjoying it. All those who know him, and have supported him , certainly are. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:43:26.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
