Total Adjusted EBITDA (1) was $163.2 million , up 20.5% from the comparable pro forma amount of $135.4 million for the year-ago period. Effective September 30, 2014 , the Company deconsolidated Borgata and is accounting for its 50% investment in Borgata by applying the equity method for periods subsequent to that date. The prior-year pro forma amounts reflect the results for Borgata on a comparable equity method basis.\nKeith Smith , President and Chief Executive Officer of Boyd Gaming, said: \"The positive momentum that began late last year carried into the third quarter, as we continued to deliver strong growth in revenues and profitability. Increased consumer spending and effective marketing programs drove revenue growth across the portfolio, and our efficiency efforts delivered strong flow-through to the bottom line. Additionally, our long-term strategic initiative to enhance amenities in key markets resulted in continued non-gaming revenue growth. In all, this was another successful quarter for our Company, as we continued to generate increased value for our shareholders.\"\nAdjusted Earnings (1) for the third quarter 2015 were $30.4 million , or $0.27 per share, compared to $0.3 million , or breakeven on a per-share basis, for the same period in 2014. The calculations of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted Earnings per share, and pro forma results reflecting Borgata on a comparable basis for all periods are presented in tables at the end of this press release.\nOn a GAAP basis, the Company reported net income of $25.4 million , or $0.22 per share, for the third quarter 2015. By comparison, the Company reported a net loss of $15.1 million , or $0.14 per share, for the year-ago period. The prior-year third quarter included a pretax impairment charge of $12.1 million to adjust the value of the Company's equity ownership in Borgata as a result of its deconsolidation, and a $6.2 million pretax impairment charge to write down certain non-operating assets to their estimated recoverable value. These prior-year charges are not included in Adjusted Earnings or Adjusted Earnings per share.\n(1) See footnotes at the end of the release for additional information relative to non-GAAP financial measures.\nKey Operations Review\nLas Vegas Locals\nIn the Las Vegas Locals segment, third-quarter 2015 net revenues increased 4.8% to $148.0 million , compared to $141.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Third-quarter 2015 Adjusted EBITDA grew 15.0% to $32.3 million , compared to $28.1 million in the third quarter of 2014. Gaming revenue growth continued, while non-gaming revenues increased for the ninth consecutive quarter. Adjusted EBITDA benefited from continued operating efficiencies, as margins improved by nearly 200 basis points across the segment. All four major Locals properties achieved year-over-year revenue and Adjusted EBITDA gains, led by particularly strong performances at The Orleans and Gold Coast .\nDowntown Las Vegas\nIn the Downtown Las Vegas segment, net revenues rose $3.3 million to $56.7 million , compared to $53.4 million in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.1 million , up $3.8 million from $6.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue growth was driven by continued gains in pedestrian traffic throughout the area, as well as strength in the Company's Hawaiian business. Adjusted EBITDA benefitted from revenue growth, strong flow-through, and the positive impact of lower fuel costs at the Company's Hawaiian charter service.\nMidwest and South; Peninsula\nIn the Midwest and South segment, net revenues were $215.8 million , an increase of 2.4% from $210.7 million in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.3% to $50.7 million , compared to $43.6 million in the year-ago period.\nThe Peninsula segment reported net revenues of $125.8 million , up 1.8% from $123.6 million in the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was $45.6 million , increasing 6.4% from $42.9 million in the year-ago period.\nContinued growth in customer spending drove increased revenues and Adjusted EBITDA across the two business segments. Additionally, refinements to operations and marketing programs led to margin improvement of more than 230 basis points across the Midwest and South and Peninsula segments.\nBorgata\nBorgata reported third-quarter 2015 net revenues of $237.5 million , increasing 13.1% from $209.9 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was $76.0 million , up 33.5% from $56.9 million in the third quarter of 2014.\nDue to its deconsolidation, the Company now applies the equity method of accounting to its 50% investment in Borgata. The Company's share of Borgata's Adjusted EBITDA was $38.0 million for the third quarter of 2015 as compared to pro forma Adjusted EBITDA of $28.4 million in the prior-year period.\nBorgata achieved its highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA ever, driven by revenue growth throughout the operations, strong flow-through, and higher table game hold. Gross gaming revenue increased nearly 14%, including an 11% increase in slot volume. Additionally, online gaming contributed $3.4 million to Adjusted EBITDA during the quarter.\nBorgata's third-quarter results were impacted by pretax losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $17.8 million , primarily related to the redemption of its 9.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2018. In addition, Borgata's income tax provision for the third quarter of 2015 was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain state income tax issues, which resulted in a $9.5 million reduction in the provision.\nBalance Sheet Statistics\nAs of September 30, 2015 , Boyd Gaming had cash on hand of $125.0 million , including $26.2 million related to Peninsula. Total debt was $3.34 billion , of which $1.02 billion was related to Peninsula. As a result of the deconsolidation, Borgata's cash and debt balances are no longer included in the Company's balance sheet. Borgata had cash on hand of $28.1 million and total debt of $677.2 million at September 30 , 2015.\nFull Year 2015 Guidance\nBased on third-quarter results and continued positive trends in the business, the Company is raising its previously provided guidance for the full year 2015. The Company now projects Adjusted EBITDA, including 50% of Borgata's Adjusted EBITDA, of $610 million to $620 million .\nConference Call Information\nBoyd Gaming will host its conference call to discuss third-quarter 2015 results today, October 22 , at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.

Holding Company owns all the equity interests in Marina District Development Company, LLC, d.b.a. Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa (\"Borgata\"). Boyd Gaming is the managing member of Holding Company and is responsible for the day-to-day operations of Borgata.\nIn February 2010 , Boyd Gaming entered into an agreement with MGM to amend the operating agreement to, among other things, facilitate the transfer of MGM's interest in Holding Company (\"MGM Interest\") to a divestiture trust (the \"Divestiture Trust\") established for the purpose of selling the MGM Interest to a third party. The proposed sale of the MGM Interest through the Divestiture Trust was part of a then-proposed settlement agreement between MGM and the New Jersey Department of Gaming Enforcement (the \"NJDGE\").\nOn March 17, 2010, MGM announced that its settlement agreement with the NJDGE had been approved by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (\"NJCCC\"). MGM transferred the MGM Interest into the Divestiture Trust on March 24, 2010 , and Boyd Gaming determined that it had control, as defined in the relevant accounting literature, of Holding Company and commenced consolidating the business as of that date. Subsequent to a Joint Petition of MGM, Boyd Gaming and Holding Company, on February 13, 2013 , the NJCCC approved amendments to the settlement agreement which permitted MGM to file an application for a statement of compliance, which, if approved, would permit MGM to reacquire its interest in Holding Company.\nThe NJCCC approved MGM's application for licensure on September 10, 2014. On September 30, 2014 , the Divestiture Trust was dissolved and MGM reacquired its Borgata ownership interest and its substantive participation rights in the management of Borgata. As a result, Boyd Gaming deconsolidated Borgata as of the close of business on September 30, 2014 , and is accounting for its investment in Borgata applying the equity method for periods subsequent to the deconsolidation.\nThe following unaudited supplemental information presents Boyd Gaming's financial results for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and pro forma financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 . The prior year unaudited pro forma financial statements give effect to:\nthe deconsolidation by Boyd Gaming of Holding Company, and the recording by Boyd Gaming using the equity method of accounting for its 50% share of the operating results of Holding Company for the periods presented, and assumes that these transactions occurred as of January 1, 2014.\nThe unaudited supplemental pro forma information has been prepared based upon currently available information and assumptions that are deemed appropriate by Boyd Gaming's management. The pro forma information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of Boyd Gaming's actual results that would have been reported had the transactions occurred on the

\"Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information in public disclosures. We believe that our presentations of the following non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance to investors: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted EPS). The following discussion defines these terms and why we believe they are useful measures of our performance. We do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding forward-looking GAAP measure due to our inability to project special charges and certain expenses.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in our industry that we believe, when considered with measures calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), provides our investors a more complete understanding of our operating results before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes and facilitates comparisons between us and our competitors. Management has historically adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. We refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA. We have chosen to provide this information to investors to enable them to perform more meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core on-going operations. We have historically reported this measure to our investors and believe that the continued inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency in our financial reporting. We use Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because we believe it is useful to investors in allowing greater transparency related to a significant measure used by our management in their financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBITDA is among the more significant factors in management's internal evaluation of total company and individual property performance and in the evaluation of incentive compensation related to property management. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in the evaluation of potential acquisitions and dispositions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by management in the annual budget process. Externally, we believe these measures continue to be used by investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our company. Adjusted EBITDA reflects EBITDA adjusted for deferred rent, preopening expenses, share-based compensation expense, impairments of assets, asset transactions costs and other operating charges, net, and Borgata's preopening expenses and other items and write-downs, net. For periods prior to the September 30, 2014 , deconsolidation of Borgata, the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA includes 100% of the adjusting items for Borgata. For periods after the date of deconsolidation, the calculation includes Boyd's share of the adjusting items. Pro forma EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA reflect Borgata on the equity method for all periods presented. Both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA include corporate expense.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted Earnings is net income (loss) before preopening expenses, asset transactions costs, impairments of assets, certain adjustments to property tax accruals, write-downs and other charges, net, losses on early extinguishments of debt, other non-recurring adjustments, net, valuation adjustments related to the consolidation of Borgata, and the impact on Boyd's income tax provision of tax audit settlements, and Borgata's preopening expenses and other items, losses on early extinguishments of debt, write-downs, net, and the income tax provision impact of tax audit settlements. For periods prior to the September 30, 2014 , deconsolidation of Borgata, the calculation of Adjusted Earnings includes 100% of the adjusting items for Borgata. For periods after the date of deconsolidation, the calculation includes Boyd's share of the adjusting items. Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS are presented solely as supplemental disclosures because management believes that they are widely used measures of performance in the gaming industry.\nLimitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and certain other non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS or certain other non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, income taxes and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization, interest and income taxes, capital expenditures and other items both in our reconciliations to the historical GAAP financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and certain other non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and certain other non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP, nor should these measures be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and certain other non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding historical GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.\nForward-looking Statements and Company Information\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
