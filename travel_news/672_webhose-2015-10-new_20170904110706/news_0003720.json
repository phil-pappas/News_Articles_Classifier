This year’s ibtm knowledge program is going to be full of inspiring and engaging content, which we hope everyone will make the most of and enjoy. \n“We’re particularly excited about Christine Renaud’s session; Brain Dating: The Next Frontier For Events. In this session, based on the case study of a partnership between C2 Montréal & E-180, social entrepreneur and CEO of E-180 will share her best practices to boost the peer-learning component of events. Following the presentation, attendees will be invited to test this unique approach by using the mobile app Braindater which will create spontaneous brain dates.” \nNegative Brainstorming: Using The Power Of The “Pre-Mortem” To Reveal Problems Before They Happen is also set to draw in the crowds. Presented by Brandt Krueger, Owner of Event Technology Consulting, the session invites participants to think creatively and critically about their events and meetings. \nKrueger comments: “In pre-mortems, stakeholders are encouraged to imagine the worst possible outcomes of their projects - and then try to make sure they never happen. Using this business strategy promoted by the likes of authors, economists, and critical thinkers, I will challenge participants to change the way that they think about meetings.” \nFinally, in partnership with ISES and presented by Héctor A. Venegas, Chief Executive Officer and Partner of SwarmWorks Ltd. and Heiner Koppermann, Co-founder and CEO of SwarmWorks Ltd. (Germany) and SwarmWorks, Inc. (USA); The Business of Bore Busting in Meetings and Events: Using Neuroscience and Technology for Breakthroughs in Live Communication will introduce the subject of collective intelligence. \nVengas comments, “In the right conditions, people are more intelligent collectively than they could ever be as individuals and this session will enable attendees to experience first-hand the power of tapping into the collective wisdom of crowds.” \nTo find out more about the Hosted Buyer Program, watch the Hosted Buyer Journey video or apply for your place click here . \nTo find out more about the benefits of attending ibtm world and to register as a trade visitor, please click here . \neTurboNews is a media partner for ibtm world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:00:15.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
