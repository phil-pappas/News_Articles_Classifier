After he notified staff when the button didn’t work the second night, the hotel upgraded him to a suite and moved all of his belongings to his new room.\nHe said: ‘It was delightful because something was wrong, there was nothing that could be done about it and I think I was being quite reasonable.’\nBe specific\nIt doesn’t hurt to write down a few notes, including exact dates or times, which can be given to staff while making a complaint.\nThe more information provided to the employee or manager, the more likely they will be able to assist.\nPhotos can help as well, especially if something is dirty, broken or faulty.\nRemember the names or any staff members who have taken a complaint.\nAirline passengers should make sure they have a genuine complaint before approaching staff at the gate\nBe reasonable\nIt’s important to remain calm and be reasonable when speaking to staff, as a confrontation will only make matters worse.\nBut don’t be too nice and understanding, as you may let the hotel, airline or cruise line off the hook.\nMr Hanson said: ‘The British are programmed to complain in quite a nice way, as opposed to Americans, for example, who make quite a song and dance about it.’\nIs it a genuine complaint?\nIf it is, be firm but fair, said Mr Hanson.\nHe added: ‘You actually have to have a genuine complaint. There are some people who complain for the sake of complaining.\n‘You need to have some just cause to complain and if right is on your side it should be easily rectifiable by whoever you’re complaining to.’\nThe goal is to get the person on your side, he said.\nExplain what you want\nStaff may ask what they can do to rectify the problem and satisfy the customer.\nUnhappy customers should clearly explain how they expect the employee to resolve the matter.\nBut they should not make unreasonable requests for free goods or services.\nPeople who work in the service industry should be treated fairly and with respect when making a complaint\nDon’t be rude\nPeople who work in the service industry are among the worst-treated employees on the planet.\nThey deserve to be treated fairly and with respect, as the problem quite often has nothing to do with their actions.\nAn employee may be less likely to help if they are insulted or talked down to.\nGo above their heads\nUsually, the first point of contact is a front-line member of staff such as an employee at a hotel’s reception desk, a flight attendant or a restaurant server.\nIf they fail to understand or resolve the complaint, ask to speak to their manager, said Mr Hanson.\nIf the traveller still isn’t satisfied, they should write a letter and send it to the manager’s boss.\nMr Hanson said: ‘When you copy it up so that the manager’s manager sees it sometimes that gives the manager a kick up the bottom.\n‘Be factual in the letter. End with a sentence or two to let them know how you feel and don’t go on too long. Let the crime speak for itself.’\nHolidaymakers who are still unhappy can also complain to industry regulators or organisations such as the Association of British Travel Agents in the UK.\nRead more: William Hanson, the UK's leading Etiquette Coach | William Hanson", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1iYbt0H", "http://williamhanson.co.uk/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-10-05T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:15:08.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
