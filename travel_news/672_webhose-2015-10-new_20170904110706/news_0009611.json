The river, by the way, would be lucky to pass for a ditch in rainier climes. That didn’t keep 19th-century flimflam artists from selling stock in the Reese River Steamship Co. to slickers back East.\nI found far more water at Spencer Hot Springs, a detour of 7 miles down a dusty dirt road that was well worth the wear and tear on my vehicle, which was, after all, a rental car.\nThe springs today are a series of small tanks, like large cattle troughs, filled continually by a trickle of naturally steaming, soothing mineral water.\nI found myself an isolated tank, stripped down to my skivvies and pulled my ukulele from the trunk. You don’t think I’d drive the Loneliest Road without a ukulele for company, do you?\nI like to imagine that the coyotes and rattlesnakes enjoyed the brief serenade of On the Road Again , Crazy , and my own little up-tempo Hawaiian/hillbilly version of Danny Boy.\nNot far from the springs, I pulled into Hickison Petroglyph Recreation Area. I picked up a self-guide brochure and followed a short trail to an incredible overlook of the Toiyabe Range to the west.\nThe carved, prehistoric abstract designs were impressive, too. The designs were etched onto huge sandstone boulders, but the boulders had been weirdly carved by wind and water long before the primitive artists arrived about 12,000 years ago. Examining their odd, alluring shapes, I could understand why those rocks would be an inviting canvas.\nFrom Hickison Summit, U.S. 50 winds 60 miles through the Monitor and Antelope valleys to Eureka, which, as the name suggests, was once a mining boom town. No more.\nAlthough mines still operate nearby, Eureka’s population now stands at 1,300, down from a peak of more than 10,000 in the 1870s. But the town still has its old courthouse and historic Jackson Hotel.\nAs a longtime newspaperman, I also enjoyed seeing the old building that once housed the Eureka Sentinel. Now the building is a museum displaying, among other things, much of the newspaper’s antique printing equipment.\nAnother must-see stop is Raine’s Market, a singular grocery/general store with a famous taxidermy display and the only place I know where a row of stuffed animal heads seems to guard the cereal aisle.\nThe Eureka Opera House, built in 1880, has been carefully restored and now is the site of special exhibits and events. I was lucky to be stopping in one night when Western singer-songwriter Juni Fisher was performing.\nFisher gave a terrific, if cowgirl-centric, concert to a tiny crowd, nearly doubled by the half-dozen souls bused in from Ely, 90 minutes away, for the event. When Fisher put down her guitar and picked up a uke for a few numbers, it made my night. You really can find kindred spirits out in the desert.\nIn Ely, I parked myself for a night at the Hotel Nevada & Gambling Hall, which was built in 1929 and has welcomed many luminaries. (I stayed next door to the Jimmy Stewart suite.)\nAlmost every little tavern along the Loneliest Road has a few slot machines in back. But the Hotel Nevada offered the only table games I found east of Reno.\nAfter a bit of $5 blackjack and a good meal at the hotel restaurant, I visited the Nevada Northern Railway Museum. Exhibits are housed in the old East Ely Depot and dozens of other buildings at the old rail yards. The museum’s rolling stock includes a working steam engine, and scenic rail rides are offered on most days during warm weather.\nGreat Basin National Park, near the Nevada-Utah line, is much smaller than the Great Basin itself, which covers some 200,000 square miles.\nBut the park includes 13,063-foot Wheeler Peak, Nevada’s second-highest mountain, and Lehman Caves, the state’s most extensive cave system, brilliantly decorated with natural features.\n“The Lonelist Road isn’t really that lonely,” said park ranger Diane Pierce.\n“You really want lonely, you should drive (U.S.) Route 6 from Ely to Tonopah. There’s nothing for 75 miles, except maybe one ranch. That’s really lonesome.”\nVisitors to the park can take a scenic drive up Wheeler Peak above the 10,000-foot level. Getting to the top requires a strenuous hike. I bypassed the summit, though, for a shorter walk to a grove of bristlecone pines, some of which are more than 5,000 years old.\nDespite the stories the ancient trees could probably tell, the grove was remarkably quiet, all sound seeming to be drawn off by the vast, empty spaces around the mountain stretching off into an immense distance.\nI finally reached Utah just a few miles east of the park.\nFrom the state line, U.S. 50 was one of the longest, straightest stretches of road I’ve encountered. The highway rose slightly toward the distant Confusion Range, offering a view of the whole length, making it seem even longer, until the road seemed to run into a wall of solid mountain in the far, far distance.\nMy destination was Delta and the Great Basin Museum. I’d miscalculated, though, and forgotten that I’d lose an hour at the state line, where Pacific Time changes to Mountain. I arrived after closing, but, happily, the museum happened to be holding an evening open house, with refreshments, a cakewalk and a string band to celebrate a new farm equipment exhibit.\nI met a lot of nice folk who were happy to welcome an itinerate newsman to their party. Among them was Gayle Bunker, whose horse-drawn Daisy Reaper machine, built in 1897, used by his grandfather and restored by his father, was the centerpiece of the new exhibit.\nHe was happy to tell me about life in the Great Basin and interested in hearing about my journey across the Loneliest Road in America.\n“You know, though, it’s not as lonely as it used to be,” Bunker said.\n“I drove it a couple years ago. There are people all over the desert.”\nsstephens@dispatch.com\n@stevestephens", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:11:20.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
