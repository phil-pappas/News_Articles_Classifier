Exact dates for the work will be announced by the New NY Bridge team, but the first is planned for Oct. 23-24.\n“Metro-North has coordinated with the New NY Bridge team to minimize the impact on Hudson Line train service while work is underway by the contractor,” said Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti. “This coordination will ensure that no passenger trains are beneath the work site while the girder assemblies are moving overhead. This means fewer trains than normal will operate during three 13-hour construction periods. Metro-North will adjust its schedule slightly on those Friday nights to accommodate this work and will communicate schedule information to our customers. We greatly appreciate that the New NY Bridge team is working with Metro-North and has scheduled their work to minimize service impacts for our customers.”\n“The New NY Bridge project team and Tappan Zee Constructors are working very closely with Metro-North as construction takes another major step forward,” said New York State Thruway Authority Executive Director Robert Megna. “Our goal is to ensure the three structural steel girder placements at the Westchester landing over the railroad are completed as safely as possible and with minimal impacts to train service.”\n \nSource:- MTA Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:40:02.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
