Did Saigon actually fall? Maybe not. \nHo Chi Minh City People’s Committee Building and Nguyen Hue boulevard. \nOfficially renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the reunification, the city is still often referred to as Saigon. Many hotels, restaurants and shops there still bear this word in their names. For sure it's not that the Vietnamese have much to miss about its foreign oppressors. But rather it's because there was a beautiful side to the French legacy which adds charm to the modern-day Saigon -- you can see it in its colonial architecture. \nThe Notre Dame Cathedral, built in 1877, is among the most famous of the survivors. Centrally located, it serves as a good starting point for visitors to explore the city's wealth of colonial buildings. \nAlthough smaller in size than its namesake in Paris, the Vietnamese version is not of any less importance. In 1962, it was designated by the Vatican as a basilica. When the cathedral was first built, the two bell towers on the façade had flat tops like the French Notre Dame. But in 1897, the spires we see today were added. They have become a feature that makes it easy for us laymen to quickly distinguish between the two churches. Literally a stone's throw from the Notre Dame is the General Post Office which is another architectural gem that allows you to appreciate its beauty up close. \nFrom the square where the cathedral and the post office sit, walk down Dhong Khoi Street and you will soon find on the left-hand side the Hotel Continental Saigon, the hangout spot for foreign reporters during the final years of the French colony. The hotel is now celebrating its 135th anniversary. \nLooking further down the road, you will see the Ho Chi Minh City Municipality Theatre, also known as the Opera House. The theatre began its operation in 1900, entertaining the French and local elites with performing troupes from France. These days it's a venue for hire for functions and various events. \nFrom Hotel Continental Saigon, if you follow Le Loi Street southwest for a few minutes, you will find an expansive pedestrian area, the Nguyen Hue Boulevard. It meets the City Hall (full name, Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee Building) at its northern end not far away and extends almost all the way to the Saigon River on the other end. \nIn front of the City Hall stands a new statue of Ho Chi Minh which replaced the former, smaller one that depicts Uncle Ho sitting with a girl, on April 30 of this year to mark the 40th year since the end of the Vietnam War. \nThe boulevard was made car-free just a few months ago. It has since become a popular recreational area for the townspeople, who come to enjoy a variety of activities in the evening, from strolling, jogging, taking selfies to singing, playing music and just people watching. \nThese are just a few snippets of Ho Chi Minh City's vast architectural heritage. Of course, even though most of these colonial buildings can be appreciated only from the outside, you will still need at least a couple of days to explore the Saigon that survived. \nDuring French rule, this elegant gate was the main entrance to the Saigon Opium Factory, one of the colonial government’s major sources of income. These days business is still brisk but it’s of a much cleaner type. The compound is now home to a number of upmarket bars and eateries. \nNot all heritage buildings are open to the public; the city’s Fine Arts Museum is among those that are. As the former residence and company of one of Cochinchina’s wealthiest families, the compound is made up of three beautiful buildings. The main one, designed by French architect Rivera in 1929, boasts a harmonious and graceful blend of Oriental and Western elements. It houses a collection of paintings and sculptures by master artists. In Building 2 you will find exhibitions of works by contemporary painters. Building 3, the smallest yet not to missed, features sculptures, ceramics and other antique works of art from different cultures that existed in what is now Vietnam, including the Champa. \nLike its neighbour the Notre Dame Cathedral, the Ho Chi Minh City Central Post Office is one of the city’s oldest and most beautiful public buildings. It was completed in 1891 after a design by Gustave Eiffel, the architect credited for the iron tower that is Paris’ worldfamous landmark. Many tourists come here not just to appreciate the architecture but also to send postcards to their friends and families. \nHo Chi Minh was a great man. There is probably no political leader in human history with more museums dedicated to his life and work as this late Vietnamese president. The one by the Saigon River in the city named after him tells current generations not just about the incredible life of the legendary patriot but also others who joined in the fight for Vietnam’s independence. This photo from 1951, one of the hundreds displayed at the museum, clearly reveals Uncle Ho’s humble and down-to-earth nature. \nThe stately neo-classical building that is the Ho Chi Minh City Museum initially served as the official residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Cochinchina. Dating back to 1890, it is the work of French architect Alfred Foulhoux who also designed a number of other colonial buildings in Saigon. Over the years, the building had been used for several purposes, including the residence of South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem who had secret escape tunnels built underneath it. Now a museum, it is dedicated to different aspects of the city’s history. Outside the building, a Soviet M41 tank and a number of military aircraft including the Huey helicopter which is often featured in films about the Vietnam War are on display. In the back of the museum, there is a café and behind the café you’ll find a collection of old cars, each of which comes with an information sign telling you how it was used to contribute to the revolutionary movement in the 1960s. \nThe Ben Thanh Market is one of the most popular places for visitors to Ho Chi Minh City. A variety of goods, from clothes, handicrafts to coffee beans, preserved food and numerous other things are on sale here. Many vendors can communicate in Thai and most shops accept Thai baht. In the next few years, the area will become a major junction for the city’s metro system which is currently under construction. \nIn Ho Chi Minh City, people watching is a pleasant way to enjoy and educate oneself. Individuals on the street can amaze you with the way they earn their living. A beverage vendor at Ben Thanh Market operates her almost invisible business with nothing more than an old icebox and a black plastic bag in which she keeps coffee, milk, sugar, limes, cups and other things. The city’s residents have so many practical ways to make the most out of their bicycles. Food vendors and their customers are also interesting to watch. Join them to get a real taste of the local life. Travel info \nA number of airlines operate direct services between Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City. I flew with Nok Air which, since the beginning of this month, offers four weekly flights on this new route, leaving Don Mueang Airport at 7.35am on Thursdays and Fridays and at 6.30pm on Monday and Sunday. The flight takes about 90 minutes. \nSaigon's city centre is not too big to explore by foot. The sun is usually very strong so you must be well prepared to deal with it. It is not without reason that locals, especially motorcycle riders, are fully covered. \nMotorcycles are notoriously popular in Vietnam. Crossing the street in Ho Chi Minh City which is home to a population of around 9 million can therefore be intimidating even for Bangkokians. But unlike Bangkok, the motorcycles in Saigon do not go very fast. They kind of flow leisurely along together, all going pretty much at the same speed and there is usually no sudden change of lanes. However, it's wise, and safer, to cross at designated spots where there are pedestrian traffic lights. It is important to be aware of the fact that motorcycles travelling against the traffic and on the pavement are a lot more common in Saigon than in Bangkok. \nThere are many hotels available in Ho Chi Minh City. The 31-floor Pullman Saigon Centre I stayed in is within walking distance from the Ben Thanh market, west of the city centre. The hotel's rooftop bar is a good place to enjoy the cityscape. You can even see the old opera house if you recognise it.
