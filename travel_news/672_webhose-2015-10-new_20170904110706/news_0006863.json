The new DFW brand and its tagline “Travel. Transformed.” were unveiled today at the Airport Headquarters to employees and community members.\n \nParticipating in the brand launch were Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price, DFW Board Chair Lillie Biggins, members of the Board of Directors and CEO Sean Donohue.\n \nDFW Airport’s current brand was introduced more than 14 years ago. Since then, DFW has opened its world-class international Terminal D, Grand Hyatt and Skylink people mover, added over a dozen new airlines and new air service to five continents and has evolved from a national hub to a world-class global superhub.\n \n“DFW is a very different airport than it was 14 years ago. With our dynamic international growth, customers’ expectations are different today than they were in 2001,” said Sean Donohue, CEO of DFW Airport. “We recognized that our brand needed to evolve and match the responsibility we have as a global hub that drives global business and contributes $32 billion annually to the local economy. The new brand signifies our commitment to our customers, positions us for the future and helps communicate our story of transformation.”\n \nToday, DFW is the fourth busiest airport in the world in operations providing nonstop flights to more than 200 destinations. DFW serves more than 63 million passengers a year, nine million more than in 2001. Seventeen cargo airlines provide service to the world’s major cargo hubs from DFW.\n \nThe new brand encompasses the Airport’s renewed commitment to elevating the customer experience and includes a visual identity and logo that is simple, clear and bold with the DFW letters prominent. A key element of the brand design is the “journey line” which moves through the logo, representing the role DFW plays in the journey of its customers.\n \n“Our new brand represents that DFW Airport will always move forward with confidence and optimism, continuously introducing the world to what’s next,” said Donohue. “The brand gives us a way to differentiate ourselves, communicate our story of transformation and excite others with our vision of the future and of connecting the world.”\n \nOrange was selected as the primary color of the new DFW Airport logo drawing inspiration from the color of the sunrise and marking the new beginning that travel brings.”The new color resonates very well globally and reflects the spirit of DFW which is warm, welcoming and optimistic,” said Donohue. “The color helps DFW stand out and convey the energy, stature and enthusiasm of a global superhub.”\n \nDevelopment of the brand was based on research and a creative design process, culminating in the final concept unveiled today. DFW contracted with the internationally renowned firm Interbrand for consultation services in developing and implementing the new brand.\n \nThe new DFW brand will be rolled out over the next three years, starting with employee attire, Skylink trains, ground transportation vehicles, signage and digital media, which were introduced today. Customers will ultimately see a completely redesigned look DFW’s web and social media presence.\n \nTwo Skylink train cars and four DFW buses were rebranded in time for the launch event. DFW also dedicated a large logo sculpture sign in front of its new headquarters, flew its new flag and unveiled a banner of the Tokyo skyline from the top floor of the headquarters building commemorating the most recent international announcement – the return of Japan Airlines to DFW with new flights to Tokyo Narita.\n \nSource:-Dallas Fort Worth International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:04:36.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
