The Costa Rican keeper continues to rise up in the discussions of the world’s best goalkeepers, as he has now led Real Madrid to sole ownership of first place in Spain’s La Liga. \nNavas made five saves on goal to secure a 3-1 Madrid win over Celta Vigo on Saturday. Early in the match, San Keylor made an incredible diving save to get enough of the ball to deflect its course from the goal. CELTA 1-3 REAL MADRIDOtro partidazo más de Keylor Navas.¡¡¡LÍDEREEES!!! pic.twitter.com/7ueU1OSAiH \n— Real Madrid C.F. (@RMadridIsco) October 24, 2015 \nCelta Vigo had another opportunity on goal in the 43rd minute when a header coming off a well-placed free kick. But Navas, who may as well have been donning a red cape Saturday, dove to the right hash to knock away the would-be goal. \nIn the second half, Celta had an easy try right in front of the net, but Navas again read the attacker and made another incredibly athletic save to keep the shutout going. \nNavas finally conceded a goal in the 85th minute, but fittingly, it took an absolute beauty to do so as Celta Vigo’s Nolito fired home a goal into the high left corner of the net to beat Navas. \nReal Madrid’s win gives it 21 points in La Liga’s standings, putting it ahead of a Celta Vigo club that remains in second place. Madrid will play next Saturday against Las Palmas to try and further its hold on the La Liga lead.
