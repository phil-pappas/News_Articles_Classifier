So imagine a meal cooked by all five. Only Redzepi and designer (and consummate hostess) Lela Rose could produce such a roster, and that’s exactly what they did last week: hosted a dinner party to end all dinner parties at Rose’s Tribeca home to benefit MAD , a nonprofit founded by Redzepi in 2011 to expand knowledge of food.\nGuests arrived to a long table inspired by Redzepi’s Noma: stark white decor paired with black chargers, wooden plates, and stone serving pieces from Dan Barber’s Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Fifty delicate paper sculptures of olive branches, parsley leaves, chives, and fennel flowers by artist Daniel Sean Murphy lined the center of the table. Rose, whose entertaining book, Prêt-à-Party , was just published, oversaw the strikingly minimal decor.\nSo what was on the menu? After a series of passed bites by Patterson and Choi inspired by their new concept restaurant, LocoL, Barber and Redzepi traded off serving two main courses each. From Barber came “NY-151 potato and cover crops” and “NY-229 potato pizza,” and from Redzepi, “scallop and grains” and “pumpkin and caviar.” Boulud then took the stage with his dessert: “Black mission fig, sweet olive oil vinaigrette, and coconut butter ice cream.” But the evening wasn’t just about the food being served, it was about the message of expanding awareness about what and how we eat. “This particular group is not only chefs but forward-thinkers about sustainability, environmentalism, and world issues surrounding food,” says Rose. “It wasn’t just a dinner party but a party with a purpose, which, to me, is the best kind.”", "external_links": ["http://www.madfeed.co/", "https://www.lelarose.com/?gclid=CL7KsdjkocgCFcERHwodpkMK8g"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:36:01.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
