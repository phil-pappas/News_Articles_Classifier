Its EnviroGuard ™ -coated steel enclosure limits corrosion while also keeping oil and shop fluids from entering the ground.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275291\n\"We wanted something that would protect the environment. Being self-contained, the Rotary Lift MOD Series gives you the protection you need,\" says Tom Hodge , Greater Dayton RTA manager of fleet maintenance. \"Everything about that lift is very earth-friendly, worker-friendly, user-friendly, and I would highly recommend it.\"\nThe MOD35 lift builds on the success of Rotary Lift's bestselling MOD30 heavy-duty inground lift. Greater Dayton RTA recently installed two MOD35 lifts to complement its existing six MOD30 lifts. All of the MOD Series lifts feature Rotary Lift's exclusive EnviroGuard treatment. EnviroGuard seals the inside and outside of the lifts' underground containment units, which are warranted against corrosion and electrolysis for 10 years.\nIn addition to the environmental benefits, Greater Dayton RTA staff also praise the MOD35's new patent-pending pendant-only control. This custom remote control comes standard with every MOD35 lift instead of a floor console. The pendant makes it easy for technicians to operate the lift from anywhere in the bay, for more efficient spotting and lifting.\nVictor D. Hall , utility specialist for Greater Dayton RTA, says the pendant makes spotting buses \"a breeze.\" \"I can actually just take the pendant right to the side of the bus, lean down, and control the lift while I'm looking at it,\" he says. \"It will retract back to the smallest piece of equipment out to the largest piece of equipment with no problem: You just hold the joystick and away it goes.\"\nTo see more of what the Greater Dayton RTA team has to say about its Rotary Lift MOD Series lifts, watch the video at https://vimeo.com/130248773 or visit www.rotarylift.com/original .
