Elliott Advisors UK, which manages money for its US hedge fund parent, said turnover fell 14pc to £89m in 2014, and it swung to a pre-tax loss of £2.3m. The loss appears to have led to a huge pay cut for its highest-paid director, who is not named. The director was awarded £38m in 2013, but for last year his pay has been slashed to a relatively meagre £1.6m. Katherine Garrett-Cox will step down from Alliance Trust's main board amid pressure from shareholders for a change in strategic direction Keith Horn, the former chief operating officer at the US hedge fund, is one of three possible recipients of the pay packet, along with Gordon Singer, who is the son of company founder Paul Singer, and chief trading officer Jonathan Pollock. The company’s overall headcount rose from 53 to 61 during the year, while the average payroll costs per employee fell from £1.55m to £1.11m. Elliott said it is appealing the Autorite des Marches Financiers’s €8m fine imposed in May 2014 for trading on inside information concerning the French motorway operator APRR. Elliott and its investment partner sold a 13pc stake in the firm in 2010, and according to the watchdog also generated profits of €2.7m by buying shares ahead of the deal. “EAUK believes strongly that the findings of the Sanctions Committee against it represent a misapplication of French law and are not supported by the evidence,” the company said. The firm agreed a truce with FTSE 250 firm Alliance Trust earlier this year after trying to push through strategy changes and new board members. @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:34:41.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
