Canada has announced a new outreach campaign with a simple message to winter ski resorts â€“ \"We can solve your staffing headaches, for free.\"\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276578LOGO\nEvery autumn, as resort managers plan for the upcoming busy ski season, they face the challenge of finding the frontline staff they need to deliver a world-class experience. With students in school, and governments worldwide clamping down on temporary foreign staffers, finding the bartenders, ski lift operators and trail groomers is becoming more and more difficult.\nInternational youth travel company, The Global Work & Travel Co., believes it has an innovative solution, in the form of working holidays.\n\"It's a beautiful matchup,\" says Eve Canali , the Partner Relations Manager of The Global Work & Travel Co. Canada . \"Ever year, hundreds of youth travel to Canada with our company, and we connect them with our network of partner organizations across the country. We'll assist with the paperwork and organizing the logistics. It's smart and simple.\"\nA working holiday is a cultural exchange that young people do in order to experience living abroad and being able to fund their stay through seasonal work. The visa is unique in that it falls outside the often-controversial 'temporary foreign workers' program. An organization is free to hire hospitality, maintenance or housekeeping staff for their resort, while the traveler gets an opportunity to visit a foreign country and see the world. The concept is not just limited to ski resorts, but almost any industry.\n\"Quite frankly, I don't know where I'd be without the staff we've brought on board from The Global Work & Travel Co. Canada ,\" said Samuel Hicks , the Director of Operations & HR Manager of Hemlock Resort in British Columbia . \"We've had fantastic experiences, hiring staff from Australia to help run our restaurant or operate the ski-lifts.\"\nStaff from The Global Work & Travel Co. Canada will be reaching out to ski and winter resorts across Canada over the next few weeks, to provide relief to companies under pressure due to seasonal staffing shortages.\nThe Global Work & Travel Co. is the world's largest working holiday travel agency, specializing in gap-years and cultural exchanges for youth. With offices in Canada , UK and Australia , Global has provided meaningful travel experiences for over 21,000 people.\nFor more information, contact:\nThorsten Himmelmann\nEmail\n1-877-744-5622\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-global-work--travel-co-offers-solution-to-winter-resort-staffing-woes-300159369.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151013/276578LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-global-work--travel-co-offers-solution-to-winter-resort-staffing-woes-300159369.html", "http://www.globalworkandtravel.com/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH27354&Transmission_Id=201510140845PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH27354&DateId=20151014", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=292330"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:19:15.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
