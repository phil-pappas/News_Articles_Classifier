TORONTO, Oct 19 — Looks like people still aren’t ready to “Let It Go” which is why we now have a “Frozen” themed airplane courtesy of Canadian airline company WestJet \nThe mostly-blue plane features Anna and Elsa working some snow magic on the tail, while snowman Olaf features on the front, lying under an umbrella on the beach. \nDisney artists and cast members collaborated with WestJet to design the Boeing 737 and it took the painting crew 21 days of 12-hour rotations to finish the paint job. \nThe plane’s interior also got a makeover, featuring decals and headrest covers that follow the exterior’s cold-to-warm theme. \nThis is the second Disney-themed aircraft to join WestJet’s fleet following the “Magic” plane that featured Sorcerer Mickey from the 1940 Disney classic “Fantasia” that was unveiled in 2013.
