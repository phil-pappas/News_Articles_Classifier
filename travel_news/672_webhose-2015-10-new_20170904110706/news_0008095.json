Rates have slightly fallen since earlier on in the year, with competitive deals on offer from multiple banks. Below, we have compiled the best deals. Applicants should bear in mind that they will not always get the rate advertised. They may even be rejected by the best deal but accepted for one of the others, although remember that each application leaves a mark on your credit file. In fact, up to 90pc of applicants are being turned down for the best deals because of their credit score . Lenders frequently offer borrowers a much higher rate than the one advertised or simply turn them away altogether. The best rates on offer are typically for loans between £7,500 and £15,000. Borrow below or above these figures, and the rate can often rise above 10pc.
