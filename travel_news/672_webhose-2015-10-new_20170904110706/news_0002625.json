Credit: Megan Ellis \nRelais & Châteaux boasts many fine hotels and villas under their collection. We were lucky enough to see what they have on offer in Cape Town and surrounds. \nOn a rainy day we enjoyed the splendour of the different hotels and estates, getting a peek at the luxury on offer. \nHere's what we found... \nThe Cellars-Hohenorts \nThe Cellars-Hohenorts boasts the old-world feel of estates that are often seen around the Western Cape, but it also has luxury at its heart. \nThe manor house is almost 100 years old and you can feel the history emanating from the architecture as you walk by. However the interiors are grand, and you would never realise the age of the buildings. \nExquisite views sneak up on your as you walk around the estate, from lush greenery to rustic verandas. \nThe lounges in the hotel are grand yet also snug. From the chubby cat snoozing on the couch to the warm fire heating up a cold day, you will feel like you're in one of the most comfortable places in the world. \nOf course, there is also the food. The Conservancy boasts an array of dishes which will satisfy almost any taste preferences. \nSee a gallery of our visit below: \nFind out more about the Cellars-Hohenorts here . \nDelaire Graff Estate \nDelaire Graff is as vast as it is elegant - the grape vines are visible from the hilltop to the edge of the estate and the views seem to go on forever. \nEverything about the wine estate seems larger than life - the high ceilings, the sprawling buildings and the giant artworks. \nUnfortunately we were unable to capture the beauty of the estate due to rain, but even that couldn't ruin our fun. \nGolf carts transport you around the estate, allowing you to take in the beauty with minimal effort. Of course, the estate also makes for a great setting for a leisurely walk. \nThe wine cellar is accompanied by the Delaire Graff Restaurant, where you are able to enjoy wine and food pairings, as well as regular dining. \nThe other restaurant, Indochine, is a feast for the eyes, with metal silhouettes of swallows gloriously adorning the ceiling. \nThe estate even has several boutiques where you can shop for diamonds and clothing. \nThe estate is a destination on its own and will keep you entertained and content. Meanwhile the accommodation seems to be the epitome of luxury and indulgence. \nFind out more about Delaire Graff here . \nEllerman House \nDid you know that Ellerman House is one of the top five highest-rated boutique hotels in Africa for multi-millionaires? In fact, it came in second place . \nThis is probably because of Ellerman House's refinement and uniqueness. \nNo one would blame you if you thought Ellerman House was actually an exceptionally elegant art museum - the walls of the hotel are lined with beautiful artworks which have been expertly laid out to be viewed and enjoyed. Rooms themselves seem to be small art installations, but they're actually havens of luxury and amazing aesthetics. \nEven the rain couldn't put a damper on our short visit to Ellerman. While the hotel boasts beautiful views in a prime location in Camps Bay, the interiors are a sight by themselves. \nIt seems like a place you could explore for hours, with interesting nooks and tucked-away rooms. \nYou can see why multi-millionaires love this boutique hotel. \nYou can read about Ellerman House on their site . \nInterested in finding out more?
