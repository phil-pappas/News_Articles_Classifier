The State of Alaska will be performing data center upgrades and maintenance to multiple state systems during this time. \nFor travel on Oct. 11 sailings, it is highly recommended that customers make reservations and purchase tickets in advance either online at FerryAlaska.com or by calling 1-800-642-0066. Making advanced reservations is the best way to guarantee travel aboard the AMHS ferries and purchasing tickets before the Oct. 11 computer system outage will make the travel experience easier. \nCustomers wishing to book travel on Oct. 11 for travel occurring the same day may do so by visiting the ferry terminal. These travelers are advised to arrive at least 2 hours prior to departure as the manual ticketing process will take longer. \nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. The AMHS reservations system is expected to be fully operable Monday, Oct. 12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:51:57.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
