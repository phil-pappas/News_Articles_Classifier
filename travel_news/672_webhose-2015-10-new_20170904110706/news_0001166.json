In fact, peak foliage has been reached only in the very northern parts of New England — more time for us to savor this incredible time of year in our part of the world.\nHere are a few ideas to help you find the perfect way to celebrate foliage season.\nFalconry: At the beautiful Woodstock Inn & Resort (14 The Green), in the quaint town of Woodstock, Vt., you can get outside and truly touch nature thanks to its new falconry program, held in partnership with New England Falconry.\nIn the resort’s historic 10,000-square-foot Rutherford Barn, surrounded by a 50-acre meadow, New England Falconry offers guests opportunities to get up close and personal with the fascinating birds of prey. The staff conducts introductory and extended flying and handling sessions, sharing the history of falconry, raptor adaptations and conservation. A 45 minute session is $95 for participants and $30 for nonparticipants. There are also weekend stay packages available that include falconry.\nYou’ll bond with the birds while soaking in the colorful surroundings. The resort has other foliage activities on tap, including bike rentals, free cruiser bikes for poking around town, hikes and more. www.woodstockinn.com\nRamblewild: Even the name sounds like fun. Ramblewild is located in the Berkshires (110 Brodie Mountain Road, Lanesboro), where even a drive during foliage season is breathtaking. But you can do so much more with a day trip to this adventure center. Its aerial park doesn’t just show you the trees, it lets you ascend them.\nSet on nine acres of pristine New England forest, the adventure begins on a central wooden platform, or “tree fort.” A variety of challenging aerial obstacle courses originate from there, going from tree to tree throughout the forest. Each course consists of 15-17 adrenaline-pumping “elements” that include high-wires, zip lines, balancing logs, rope ladders, cargo nets, suspended bridges and the like. There’s an 80-foot ravine with a 200-foot suspension bridge, and you can cross it via zip lines.\nRamblewild has added a new cool way to get into nature during foliage time with a Pinzgauer all-terrain vehicle. Visitors can climb aboard this six-wheeled Swiss military vehicle to explore the stunning 1,450-acre property.\nThe Fall Foliage Pinzgauer Tours are available several times per day, Wednesday through Sunday, and cost $45 per person. (In addition to $48 park admittance price.) www.ramblewild.com\nHike: Hiking during foliage season is something everyone in New England should do at least once. Trails are well marked in state parks, and some even have guides. One favorite is Lafayette Trail, located in Franconia Notch State Park (Flume Gorge, Daniel Webster Highway, Lincoln, N.H.) The lovingly-maintained trail always has rangers on duty who will point you in the right direction and make sure you are properly dressed and carrying what you need for a successful hike. This is not an extreme hike, but it’s enough of a challenge to make you feel you’ve earned the spectacular view. Looking down over Cannon Mountain and across the entire state, on a clear day you can see for hundreds of miles. www.nhstateparks.com/franconia.html\nThere are numerous great hiking choices, many closer to home. From the simple paths along the Concord River in Concord, to the trails of the Arnold Arboretum, to the Rail Trails of Cape Cod, there is a wealth of safe, well-maintained and beautiful places to walk along this extended foliage season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:52:17.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
