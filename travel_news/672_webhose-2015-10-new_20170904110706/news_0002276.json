As the third largest arena in London, the Copper Box collected the prestigious accolade for quickly establishing itself as London’s most versatile entertainment and events space. \nSince opening its doors to the public in 2013, the Arena has hosted major international sporting competitions in front of capacity crowds and is utilised for a variety of events, including award ceremonies, conferences, trade shows, car launches, exhibitions and television spectaculars. In addition, the venue continues to deliver its London 2012 Legacy commitments through running a diverse and plentiful grassroots sports programme for the local community. In its first full year in operation, the Copper Box Arena successfully delivered 423,000 visits and 224 events of which 106 were community and non-sporting events, 94 sporting events and 24 British Basketball League games. The New Event Space award is a huge boost to the Copper Box Arena which leisure charitable social enterprise GLL has been managing since 2012 on behalf of the London Legacy Development Corporation, creating 50 jobs, under the consumer facing brand Better. Peter Bundey, Deputy Managing Director, GLL said: “10 years ago, GLL were instrumental in backing the bid that brought the 2012 Games to London. Three years ago we were proud to be entrusted with the management of the Copper Box Arena - one of London’s premier sports venues - in legacy mode. “Today, this award confirms we have met our commitment to deliver not only a successful sport and leisure community programme for the residents of East London but establish the venue as a home for major sporting events – such as the Invictus Games, England Netball International and World Wheelchair Rugby Challenge 2015 - and as a top class corporate event and entertainment venue.” Peter Tudor, Director of Visitor Services, London Legacy Development Corporation, said: “We are delighted that all of the hard work that has gone into delivering a lasting legacy for the Copper Box Arena after the Games is delivering such resounding results. This award is great recognition of the versatility of the venue and its success in the years since the summer of 2012.” The good news follows the shortlisting of GLL under its consumer facing Better brand as National Facility Operator of the Year for swimming venues including the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre and the London Aquatics Centre at the ASA National Awards (14 November). The Copper Box Arena is available for private hire for community and corporate events, which have recently included the Gfinity European Gaming Championship, the launch of the Fiat 500X and the Toni & Guy Fashion Awards.
