Although not adhered to as strictly as it once was; many of the islands still keep that tradition alive with Friday night community fish frys that celebrate the catch of the day. Bring your appetite and your dancing shoes for a tasting tour of the top five Fish Fry feasts under the starry skies. \nThe Bahamas Open seven days a week (although busiest on Fridays), the smorgasbord is served from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday to Thursday, until midnight on Friday and Saturday and 9 p.m. on Sunday. (Photo: nassauparadiseisland.com) \nPassing the test of time with flying colors, Fish Fry at Arawak Cay was born in 1969 when the harbor was dredged and the sand used to build a cay. Along the waterfront just west of downtown Nassau, the curve of land was named for the Arawaks; the first West Indian inhabitants and today serves up some of the most authentic Bahamian fare on the island. About 15 pastel-painted shacks with names like Twin Brothers, Bruno’s, Candies and Oh Andros invite the hordes of hungry to take five at open-air tables on West Bay Street. Close to the hotels and resorts on Cable Beach, chefs serve up a smorgasbord of fishy palate-pleasers like grilled shrimp, fried snapper, buttery lobster tails and the iconic Bahamian conch delectable in a salad, frittered or scorched, as the locals say, which means rubbed with a spicy melange of lime and peppers. Sides like a wedge of cornbread and a scoop of killer mac cheese do a heaping platter proud. Thirst-quenchers on the A-list include the local Kalik beer, fruity Bahama Mamas or for those with a sweet tooth, Sky Juice is a potent blend of gin, coconut water, sweet milk, ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Open seven days a week (although busiest on Fridays), the smorgasbord is served from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday to Thursday, until midnight on Friday and Saturday and 9 p.m. on Sunday. An open-air stage hosts Junkanoo bands and if you’re lucky, you might catch ‘The Valley Boys’ rehearsing for the New Year’s Parade. \nGrenada On the main streets that are closed to cars, Gouyave Fish Friday is big on flavors from fish balls, fish loaf and fish cakes to quiche, pizza and kebabs made from bounty fresh from the sea. (Photo: Grenada Tourism Authority) \nIt’s a frenzied fiesta of fish on the northwest coast in a small town called Gouyave (pronounced Gwav) where chefs get busy every Friday night with their fryers, barbecues, steamers and grills. On the main streets that are closed to cars, Gouyave Fish Friday is big on flavors from fish balls, fish loaf and fish cakes to quiche, pizza and kebabs made from bounty fresh from the sea. Along St Francis Street and Chapel Lane, chefs at the stalls and kiosks are delighted to scoop a side of coo coo (fried breadfruit) and pour you a cold brew or glass of fruity rum punch. Named for the many groves of guava trees, the little town of Gouyave heats up with steel bands and drummers who spike the air with their booty-grinding calypso rhythms until the wee hours. Hiring a guide is recommended, as driving up the coast can be tricky and parking a challenge. “During the journey to the festival,” says Edwin Frank, affable owner of Edwin Frank Tours, “I provide a commentary about our islands highlights like the underwater sculpture park, various parishes and the Grenada Revolution.” Tours for four are priced at USD$20.00 per person and include hotel pick up and return. Reservations are recommended:1-473-407-5393 or edwinnatfrank@gmail.com. \nBarbados Oistins is legendary not only as the epicurean epicenter for all things fried but also for the seasoned fishermen (yes, they are mostly men) who are island-famous for catching the tastiest tuna, kingfish, marlin and mahi mahi on the south coast. (Photo: David Cowan) \nBy day, it’s a fairly quiet fishing town in the parish of Christ Church, but at night — especially Friday night — Oistins is packed with locals and travelers sitting shoulder-to-shoulder at picnic tables piled high with plates of grilled flying fish wrapped in tin foil, wedges of macaroni pie, mounds of savory rice and peas and frosty cups of Banks Beer. Named after a raucous landowner called Austin who frequented the town’s many rum shops, Oistins is legendary not only as the epicurean epicenter for all things fried but also for the seasoned fishermen (yes, they are mostly men) who are island-famous for catching the tastiest tuna, kingfish, marlin and mahi mahi on the south coast. Get there early to pick up a bag of scraps and head to the jetty to feed the turtles swimming alongside the boats. By 7 p.m., the throngs have arrived, the music is loud and the old-timers have wrapped up their game of dominoes. Stay until midnight for a second helping and a spin around the makeshift dance floor. As it’s close to Sandals Barbados , resort guests are encouraged to soak up the local vibe with Friday night shuttle buses to the Fish Fry. Hitting the sweet spot of sustainability, $5.00 of the $7.00 fee goes to the Sandals Foundation that benefits the local environment. \nSt Lucia With no shortage of rummy cocktails and live bands, the party is booming and sweaty way past midnight. Tours offered by Real St. Lucia are recommended for taking in the sights along the way. (Photo: stlucianewsonline.com) \nFor nearly two decades, Anse La Raye Fish Fry in the largest town in Anse la Raye Quarter is the go-to Friday night party for king lobster, red snapper, crab cakes, conch, shrimp and a yummy slow-simmered octopus stew. On the west coast halfway between the cities of Castries and Soufriere, fish fans head to Front Street, which runs parallel to the beach, to wait in line as enterprising cooks fire up their grills and barbecues and fill big platters with bargain-priced treats like a USD$15 grilled lobster. With no shortage of rummy cocktails and live bands, the party is booming and sweaty way past midnight. Tours offered by Real St. Lucia are recommended for taking in the sights along the way. “There is no better place to enjoy local food,” smiles Janus Gyan, team leader and guide, “And to see our most popular attractions, like the two waterfalls named after the river rock and the village and the rivers Grande Riviere de l’Anse la Raye and Petite Riviere de l’Anse la Raye that flow right into the Bay.” \nAntigua Come hungry for scrumptious appetizers like dumplings and saltfish cakes and stay for the seafood rice that is jam-packed with shrimp and mussels and a side salad splashed with a piquant passion fruit marinade. (Photo: Copper and Lumber Hotel) \nGood things come in small packages at Nelson’s Dockyard overlooking the yacht-stocked English Harbour. It’s called ‘ Seafood Friday ’ and it’s one of the tastiest treats in the capital city of St John’s. On the dockside lawn of the charming 14-room Copper and Lumber Hotel (which was constructed by Lord Nelson in 1783 to store the copper and lumber used to build ships), the spirited soiree gets underway at 7 p.m. with smiling chefs like Alex and welcoming bartenders like Marlon ready to greet guests. Come hungry for scrumptious appetizers like dumplings and saltfish cakes and stay for the seafood rice that is jam-packed with shrimp and mussels and a side salad splashed with a piquant passion fruit marinade. Snapper so fresh it’s still angry goes for between USD$19.00 and USD$21.00 depending on the size and with plenty of carbs like potatoes, rice, macaroni and boiled corn, you’re guaranteed a full belly. For true seafood fanatics, there are plenty of choices like lobster with all the trimmings and seafood pasta and garlic bread so good you can’t eat just one slice. If meat is your muse, look for Chef Sergia, whose infectious smile is easy to spot at her flame-licked steak grill. Local spin master Kuma keeps the Fry lively with his Caribbean rhythms until 10 p.m. Reservations are appreciated: 1-268-460-1058.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:42:35.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
