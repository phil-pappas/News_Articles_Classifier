CROWDED, BUT NOT SO MUCH! The west coast of the Island has many beaches, but mostly are urbanized! During holidays they usually get crowded, but those days I was there, they weren't all that much! When I arrived in ILHA BELA it was cloudy and rainy, but the sunset was wonderful like in this picture! The next entire day was bright and sunny, with warm temperatures, not too humid, that means, just the way I like weather to be when I visit beaches! Together with that the scenes of Ilha Bela surely get even prettier and more pleasant-looking! It was very enjoyable to be there! I was in ILHA BELA for four times: 2005 (first time), 2007, 2013 and 2014 ! I'll be back for sure, although there are so many other places I want to visit or revist! Once more, visiting ILHA BELA! I arrived there on december 5th and, as the weather forecast had told us, it would be cloudy and rainy in the morning, but it would be better in the late afternoon and on during the whole week-end! Fortunately, it was precisely correct and the following days there we had such a wonderful time and I fell in love with this island again! Ilha Bela has more than 40 beaches and 365 waterfalls! It's the third largest island in the brazilian coast and the one that has the highest peaks, ancient volcanoes: BAEPI (1,048 masl), PAPAGAIO (1,302 masl) and SÃO SEBASTIÃO (1,378 masl). It's official name is ILHA DE SÃO SEBASTIÃO (SAN SEBASTIAN ISLAND). It's got a STATE PARK where 3% of the remaining MATA ATLÂNTICA (Atlantic Woods) of the State of São Paulo is preserved!
