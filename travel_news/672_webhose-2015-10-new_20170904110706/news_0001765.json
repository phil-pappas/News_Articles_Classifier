Many historic destinations embody a specific period in our nation's history: Philadelphia and Boston for colonial America; Natchez, Miss., for the South's antebellum heritage; even Honolulu for World War II. Wilmington provides an authentic glimpse into all these eras in one compact, walkable downtown.\nFounded in 1740, the city was an important port along the Southeastern seaboard during the 18th and 19th centuries. Perched on the Cape Fear River 30 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, Wilmington joined Charleston and Savannah as a significant commercial center.\nHowever, it was little more than a trading outpost when 22-year-old John Burgwin sailed up the river in 1753. Having come to America seeking his fortune, the enterprising Welshman proved a savvy real estate investor and merchant, soon acquiring a prime lot to build a house. Never mind that it was the site of the dilapidated jail. The property was well-situated, and the jail's foundation, on which the house was to be built, was solid.\nCompleted in 1770, the Burgwin-Wright House offers visitors a window into life in colonial Wilmington. Faithfully restored, the Georgian house would fit alongside dwellings in Society Hill or Williamsburg. Remnants of the jail's original outdoor holding cells form part of the foundation and are still visible between the main house and kitchen outbuilding.\nMore coverage Where the Venus flytrap grows A Boston market for every taste and price point Flying museum visits Coatesville By the Revolutionary War, Wilmington had more than 1,200 residents, making it the largest city in North Carolina. Skirmishes between Colonials and Redcoats occurred frequently in and around the city. The British occupied it in spring 1781, and Lord Gen. George Cornwallis spent time at the Burgwin-Wright House.\nThroughout the next century or so, Wilmington thrived. Its proximity to the coastal plantations that produced pine-related products used for shipbuilding - pine tar, pitch, and turpentine - made it the center for exporting some of the South's most important products.\nA block or two from the Burgwin-Wright House are two house museums that depict this period of prosperity. The Latimer House is an Italianate mansion built in 1852 by the wonderfully named dry-goods merchant Zebulon Latimer. The house remained in the family until the 1960s, when it was donated to the local historical society.\nMany of its original furnishings are on display. Opulent crystal chandeliers, marble statues, and artwork demonstrate the urban sophistication of Wilmington in its heyday.\nThe third major house available for tours, the Bellamy Mansion, was completed in 1860. Although a few years younger than Latimer House, it harks back to an earlier era. With its massive columns and sweeping verandas, it seems less like a townhouse than a grand Southern plantation house that somehow wound up in downtown Wilmington. Scarlett O'Hara would be right at home on the front steps.\nUnlike the others, the Bellamy Mansion is largely unfurnished. A fire destroyed most of the original furnishings shortly after Bellamy descendants deeded the house to a museum trust in 1972. Upon restoration, the trustees chose to focus on the architecture of the house and outbuildings. Tours highlight features such as the belvedere - a windowed tower that draws air up and out through the roof, a primitive version of air-conditioning - as well as a 19th-century bathroom with indoor plumbing.\nNot everyone at the mansion was enjoying these amenities in the antebellum South. The Bellamys were slave owners, and perhaps the most important, if somber, of the relics on the property are the slave quarters out back. The two-story brick structure incorporated into the back wall of the property is considered one of the best-preserved examples in the country. At first glance, the slave quarters resemble a charming row of city townhouses, until the tour guide points out the lack of windows and doors on the rear brick wall, a feature designed to keep slaves from escaping at night.\nWilmington was an important supply port for the Confederate army during the Civil War, before being captured by Union soldiers in early 1865. The Bellamy home became the headquarters of the Union Army and was seized by the federal government at the close of the war. Dr. Bellamy, the family patriarch, had to petition President Andrew Johnson to have his home returned to the family.\nAfter the Civil War, Wilmington was no longer a commercial hub. Demand for pine-related materials sank as shipbuilders turned to metal-clad vessels, so the shipping industry declined. Many of the city's newly freed black citizens migrated inland to Raleigh for better job opportunities. Wilmington settled into a more sedate pace, its historical buildings safely out of the path of progress and a potential wrecking ball.\nWorld War II brought Wilmington back into the limelight and help shaped the cityscape as it is today. More than 240 U.S. Navy ships were built at a shipyard created as part of the government's Emergency Shipbuilding Program. It was dismantled in the 1960s, but the view across the Cape Fear River of the USS North Carolina - its 16-inch gun turrets that once pounded Iwo Jima and Okinawa now pointing silently at the waterfront - takes visitors back to another era.\nThe most decorated battleship of World War II, a National Historic Landmark, is now preserved as a museum and memorial to the state's war veterans. When it was due to be scrapped in 1958, residents of its namesake state held a fund-raising campaign to have the ship berthed and displayed in Wilmington; many of the donations consisted of dimes contributed by schoolchildren in exchange for an admission ticket.\nOn a self-guided tour that takes about two hours, visitors can scurry up and down ladders to explore virtually every nook and cranny on nine decks of the historic ship, from the massive steam turbines in the engine room to the command center on the bridge.\nAcross the river, stroll over to the restored Hannah Block USO to stay \"In the Mood.\" The building opened in December 1941 to provide an activities center for the thousands of military personnel training in southeastern North Carolina. Throughout the war, the USO hosted 35,000 uniformed visitors per week.\nToday, the building is a community arts center, but the lobby has been preserved as a small museum to the war years. Seating areas are furnished in vintage style amid display cases of uniforms and wartime memorabilia, with music from the 1940s playing softly in the background. The (nonworking) refreshment counter still posts wartime prices for ginger ale and Pepsi Cola, along with \"coffee and doughnuts always free.\"\nIt is a step back in time, much like the rest of Wilmington.
