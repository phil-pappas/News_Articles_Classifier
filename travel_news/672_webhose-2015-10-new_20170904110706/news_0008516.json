The menu, unsurprisingly, focuses on seafood – this time Asian-inspired dishes – but the venue itself also has aspirations towards becoming a meeting point for heavy hitters in the creative industry. Its art collection will include installations from Frank Gehry and works by Damien Hirst, Michael Roberts and others, and a number of tanks packed with tropical fish should help hold the attention of whoever might end up there after a big night out –the restaurant will open until 3am. Opening prep.

The easy-to-locate restaurant in St James’s will open from 7am to midnight daily so there’ll be plenty of dining opportunities on offer. Breakfast dishes will include basics such as buttermilk pancakes and baked eggs, while those on lunch and dinner dates can choose between solid, unpretentious dishes such as lamb cutlets, or more unusual options such as spatzle with lobster and sea aster. A second branch of popular ping pong haunt, Bounce, arrives in Shoreditch this month. Following in the footsteps of its Farringdon original, the Old Street offering is below ground and kitted out with rows of table tennis tables. With graffiti-covered surfaces and edgy fluorescent lights, the younger sibling has a little more about it (as the endlessly hip neighbourhood dictates it must), but the successful formula is much the same: book a table (from £10 for 30 minutes in off-peak time, up to £28 for an hour in peak times), order a beer or cocktail, and some of the bar’s renowned pizza, and show off an immense lack of hand-eye coordination like everyone else in the room. Opening on Chelsea ’s Hollywood Road, Bandol restaurant will serve Nicoise and Provencal sharing dishes. Its owners set up Margaux wine bar in South Kensington in 2013, so fans of that venue should expect a complementary vibe and style here. • The best hotels in central London London is home to some of the best hotel bars in the world , but it’s good to see the Corinthia Hotel is making an effort to improve things further. Adopting one of Italy’s greatest culinary traditions, its Massimo Ba r will now serve complimentary aperitivo to drinkers between 5.30pm-7pm from Monday to Saturday. Light dishes on the menu include arancini, freshly baked breads and regional cheeses and meats. Nearby, The Savoy is also trying something new. Its new “ Temptation Wheel ” is a mahogany spinning wheel with different sections representing different chocolates, desserts and cocktails. Visitors to the hotel’s atrium, wedged between its American and Beaufort bars, can spin the wheel for ordering inspiration and though the answer obviously isn’t binding, it might provide the encouragement they need to choose sundries such as the Kings and Quince cocktail – a mix of fruit, spices and vanilla – or the One Thousand and One Layers cake with ginger cream, mangoes and passion fruit caviar.
