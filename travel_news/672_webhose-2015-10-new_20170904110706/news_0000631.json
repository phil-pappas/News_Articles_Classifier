Whether that’s a good thing depends on the city. Officials view them either as a scourge or as an attraction.\nIn Paris, where there may be more locks than ever, it’s the former.\n“People who haven’t been to Paris can’t understand how bad it is,” Lisa Anselmo, a co-founder of nolovelocks.com , a grass-roots group whose goal is to educate the public about the damage the locks can cause. “When we travel to other cities as a tourist, we should think about our impact on the people who live there.”\nThe group’s online petition requesting that Paris ban the locks citywide has more than 10,000 supporters.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Paris Bridge’s Love Locks Are Taken Down JUNE 1, 2015 Paris Falls Out of Love With the Padlocks on Its Bridges SEPT. 20, 2014 Using a formula based on how many locks the city said it removed from the Pont des Arts, Ms. Anselmo, estimated that there are now roughly 1.5 million locks in the city, attached to 11 bridges and several landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower.\nThe locks became a craze in Rome almost a decade ago, inspired by a successful novel, and Paris became a destination for people in search of a bridge on which to hang their locks more than five years ago.\nThe removal of locks from the Pont des Arts in June came a year after a section of fencing collapsed under their weight. Citing aesthetic and structural concerns, the city removed the grilles of locks and temporarily replaced them with panels painted by street artists.\nContinue reading the main story Video Love Locks Removed From Paris Bridge Tourists lamented the removal of 45 tons of padlocks from Paris’s Pont des Arts on Monday. Authorities say their weight is damaging the structure, and will replace them with plexiglass panels.\nBy Reuters on Publish Date June 1, 2015. Photo by Philippe Wojazer/Reuters. Watch in Times Video » embed Now, Paris is installing permanent anti-reflective glass panels on the bridge and expects to complete work by January, a city official said. A similar upgrade will take place on another bridge that is filling with locks, the Pont de l’Archevêché near Notre Dame, early next year.\n“There are many other ways to say, ‘I love you,’ ” Bruno Julliard, Paris’s deputy mayor in charge of culture, said in June. “The message we want to send is that this practice has to stop.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Paris has yet enact a citywide ban, and despite the effort to encourage tourists to instead take selfies and post them to social media with the hashtag #LoveWithoutLocks, determined tourists are locking their love anywhere they can find space.\n“People hang locks next to signs that say ‘Don’t Hang Locks,’ ” Ms. Anselmo said. “There are even locks on garbage cans.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Since the locks started appearing in Paris, they’ve spread to several other cities, large and small, in all parts of the world.\nSo many have cropped up on the Brooklyn Bridge in New York that the city’s Transportation Department began removing them in the summer of 2013, a department official said.\nThe department said the locks pose a danger to the infrastructure and the cars on the bridge, and that 9,363 locks were removed from Jan. 1 to Sept. 25 this year.\nContinue reading the main story DOT removed 450 #BrooklynBridge #LoveLocks today; that's another 75lbs of waste headed to landfill :( #NoLoveLocks ! pic.twitter.com/SDfwr6en0Y\n— NYC DOT (@NYC_DOT) April 6, 2015 Other cities, though, are welcoming the trend.\nIn the small Scotland town of South Queensferry, a fund-raising event was organized around the Forth Road Bridge’s 50th anniversary to raise money for a local charity.\nThe town sold more than 3,000 love locks through a website, according to Chris Waite, the communications manager for the Forth Road Bridge, and raised more than £10,000 (over $15,000). But the town made sure the bridge could take it.\n“We learned from the experience of Paris and provided specially designed panels that were strong enough to take the weight of the locks,” Mr. Waite said.\nGeorge Affleck, a member of the Vancouver City Council, first learned what a love lock was during a visit to Paris in 2012.\n“At that time they hadn’t overwhelmed that bridge, but I thought it was quite interesting to watch people share their love and express it through this lock,” Mr. Affleck said.\nThree years later, Mr. Affleck is known in Vancouver as “the C ouncillor of Love” for his continued efforts to find a permanent location in the city for tourists and residents to attach love locks.\nThe locks began appearing spontaneously on bridges and fences around Vancouver a few years ago, and eventually caused infrastructure and safety concerns, particularly on bridges not built to withstand the weight of the locks, and had to be removed.\nMr. Affleck’s efforts led to a public survey in August by the Vancouver Park board, which allowed Vancouver citizens to have their say on a permanent location for love locks.\nIn October, the city approved Queen Elizabeth Park as the future home for an art installation that locks can be attached to.\n“It’s not a new idea, but we’ll put sort of a Vancouver twist on it,” John Coupar, the city’s park board chairman, said.\nThe idea of turning love locks into art has been done elsewhere, including Toronto , Moscow and several European cities.\nLike Mr. Affleck in Vancouver, Mathew Rosenblatt, a developer of the Distillery District in Toronto and the designer of its love locks art installation, was inspired by what was happening in Paris.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story “It looked like the opportunity of love locks was dying,” Mr. Rosenblatt said. “We wanted to plant new seeds and allow people to express themselves, even if it’s across the ocean.”\nUnlike Vancouver’s project, the sculpture in Toronto, which uses metal and wood to spell the word “love,” is not a city initiative and resides on private land. It was not created to solve any particular problem the city was having with the locks.\nContinue reading the main story One reason to love #Toronto . While other cities are busy tearing down love locks we're building them. via @blogTO pic.twitter.com/hlZrC6YN2B\n— Mikey Sadowski (@MikeySadowski) June 12, 2015 “For us, it was an opportunity to take an idea that’s happened organically and create conditions where the city could come, or at least this city could come, and allow that organic love to flourish again,” Mr. Rosenblatt said.\nMr. Rosenblatt said residents and tourists have responded well to the installation, which opened in August 2014.\nCould a designated area for love locks help to solve the problem in Paris?\n“No, that ship has sailed. The problem is too big to control or contain,” Ms. Anselmo said. “You can’t possibly say, ‘You can hang locks here, but not over there.’ It’s a mania now.”\nWhile unregulated love-locking can cause problems, it’s clear that tourists enjoy the activity, and will likely continue to do it where it’s allowed.\n“People want to recognize moments in their lives,” Mr. Coupar said, “and love is an important thing to people.”\nLoading...
