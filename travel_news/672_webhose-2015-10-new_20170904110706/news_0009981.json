The San Francisco icon features redesigned guestrooms and reimagined public spaces, including the famed Garden Court. On track to surpass 100 hotels in more than 30 countries by the end of 2015, The Luxury Collection is one of the world’s fastest growing luxury hospitality brands, continuing to expand and improve its renowned hotel portfolio around the world. \n“Entertaining generations of San Francisco’s most innovative social set, from Thomas Edison and Henry Ford to the tech titans of today, The Palace Hotel endures as the city’s most captivating destination,” stated Hoyt H. Harper II, Global Brand Leader, The Luxury Collection Hotels & Resorts. “A new age of contemporary glamour has debuted at this beloved address, and the renovation of The Palace Hotel reinforces The Luxury Collection brand’s commitment to investing in our landmark hotels and to growing our global portfolio in destinations that our guests are clamouring to explore.” The Palace Hotel, known for over a century as the arbiter of San Francisco style and society, was once at the center of America’s first Golden Age of Travel, which inspired the exquisite interior re-design of the hotel led by Beatrice Girelli of indidesign. The hotel’s 556 luxuriously-appointed guestrooms, including 55 suites, reflect a modern sophistication, complemented by original design elements, including elegant crown moldings that frame wrought-iron windows and solid oak doors adorned with brass monogrammed knobs. Dark wood furnishings, mixed metals, and artistic lighting juxtapose a fresh color palette of midnight blue, charcoal, dove grey and plum textiles to create an exquisitely layered look. Former icons of industry, politics, innovation, aviation and cinema – who called The Palace their San Francisco home – inspired the guestroom design. For instance, trim lines, stitching and tailored bed frames recall the details of men’s suiting and speak to the custom-made clothing worn by former guests such as Andrew Carnegie. Complementing the design of the space, feminine details are introduced in the drapery and upholstery, inspired by the sultry elegance of Sophia Loren. Nightstands are inspired by vintage travel trunks, like those carried by Amelia Earhart, with stitched leather details and chrome accents. Several grand suites have been introduced to the hotel following the renovation, including the Royal Suite and the State Suite. The Royal Suite spans almost 1,000 square feet with breathtaking city views from curved windows that hug the corner of the suite’s living room. Meticulous architectural details, including an intricately carved marble fireplace, give the suite tremendous character and balance the palette of pale blue, plum and ivory textiles and furnishings throughout. Similarly, the State Suite is designed to feel like an elegant San Francisco apartment with natural light that streams through large windows, classically-inspired contemporary furnishings, hardwood floors, lush custom-made area rugs throughout every room and a serene spa-like bath that completes this city retreat. In addition to the introduction of several new specialty suites, the hotel’s renowned Presidential Suite has also been refreshed. Lined with expansive windows, the six-room suite wraps around the northwest corner of the hotel’s eighth floor, overlooking Market Street. The Presidential Suite’s luxurious bedroom is adorned in neutral tones and ocean blues alongside a large marble bath featuring a glass enclosed rain shower, spa tub, and exquisite amenities. A spacious living room and formal dining room – each with original carved fireplaces, authentic architectural detail, and vintage chandeliers – are beautifully appointed with classically inspired, contemporary furnishings and a baby grand piano. The suite also features a media room, kitchen, and guest bath, completing the feeling of a private residence in a cosmopolitan city setting.
