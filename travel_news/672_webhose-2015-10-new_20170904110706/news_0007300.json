The negotiation between the 2,700-plus pilot group and the Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary began in late-June 2013. \n\"Getting to this point has required a massive effort from top to bottom,\" NJASAP President Pedro Leroux said. \"We could not have succeeded without the tremendous support of our members and their families: I am extremely proud of this outstanding group of professional pilots.\" The Union president added, \"I would also like to thank the National Mediation Board, the new NetJets senior management and their negotiators for their commitment to the bargaining process.\" \nThroughout the next several days, the parties will work to finalize the negotiated language that will form the tentative agreement. Although the details have not yet been released, the NJASAP Executive Board and Negotiators have confirmed the proposed agreement features enhancements consistent with the Membership's goals of protecting, repairing and improving the previous agreement. \n\"In our highly competitive segment of aviation, major improvements to collective bargaining agreements require that everyone do their part to ensure the highest levels of safety, customer service and reliability,\" Leroux said. \"The NJASAP pilots have led the industry in these categories, and, going forward, we will redouble our efforts to ensure NetJets retains its industry-leading position.\" \nThe Union has scheduled the 2015 Tentative Agreement Referendum to begin in late November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:57:38.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
