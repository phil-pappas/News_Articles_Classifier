Agent Andrew Langsford said the company was committing to selling but wouldn't comment on the price they were chasing this time around. \n\"We've had some very strong interest... the majority of it was domestic and a healthy amount of offshore interest,\" he said.

It'll need a bit of money spent on it. (Islands) are not cheap to do up because you're so remote everything has to come in on a barge.\" \n>> Heron Island for sale: your stories, photos \nDespite the romantic location, we understand Heron Island Resort has been through its fair share of managers over the years. \nMr Johansen says that short cycle on most island resorts is because of the isolation and pressure on managers. \n\"Logistically there are a lot challenges. You are virtually running a little city where you have to provide water, power and sewerage. Everything around you is heritage listed and compliance is very stringent,\" he said. \nBut, he says, profitability is easy if the basics are done right; the right people are hired, because the Great Barrier Reef will always attract the visitors. \n\"When people think of Australia they picture the Uluru, Sydney Opera House and the Great Barrier Reef, they are always going to come,\" he said. \n\"Heron Island is right on the reef, and is really a great resort.\" \nMr Johansen added that the resort had been profitable in his four years at the helm. \nMr Langsford said the main selling point for Heron Island was the wildlife. \n\"It has a spectacular natural habit. (One of the most famous undersea explorers) Jacques Cousteau put it in his top 10 diving sports in the world,\" he said. \n\"There's been some trading growth across the Great Barrier Reef over the last 12 months on the back of the low Australian dollar with an increase travel from Asia,\" he said. \nThe agent wouldn't say how much commission he would get when the sale is made; but it wouldn't be pocket money. And he said he isn't expecting it to be a fire sale. \n\"Historically they do take some time; it's in a remote location,\" he said. \n\"They would most likely visit the island before they buy it.\" \nSo, we'll certainly be keeping an eye on the private jets that start landing at Gladstone Airport. editors picks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:48:03.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
