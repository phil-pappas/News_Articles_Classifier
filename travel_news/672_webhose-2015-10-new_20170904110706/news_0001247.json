Source: Supplied\nThe production cuts will be implemented in the current quarter, Glencore said.\n“Glencore believes that current prices do not correctly value the scarcity of our zinc resources. Our finite resources are valuable and reducing production, in response to current prices, preserves value and optionality for all stakeholders,” it said in a statement.\nThe company said it is undertaking a statutory consultation process with its employees.\nGlencore’s financial health has been under immense scrutiny in recent weeks due to its $US29 billion in debt, and the increasing contributions to earnings from its relatively unknown commodities trading operations.\nShares in the firm have fluctuated wildly amid investor fears that sinking commodity prices will affect its ability to meet outstanding debt obligations.\nGlencore shares have plunged more than 60 per cent this year . Earlier this week, the company said its Australian coal mines will be shut down if the long downturn in commodity prices makes them unprofitable.\nOriginally published as Glencore to shed jobs in Australia", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/glencore-prepared-to-make-tough-decisions/story-fnkgdg1h-1227560813244", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/09/1227563/299192-f3c29302-6e27-11e5-8252-216a34f84008.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/glencore-to-shed-jobs-in-australia/story-fnkgdg1h-1227563298957", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/could-glencore-trigger-the-next-gfc/story-fnkgdg1h-1227550915667"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:59:10.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
