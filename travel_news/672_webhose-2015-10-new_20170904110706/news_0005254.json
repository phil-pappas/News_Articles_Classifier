But have we clued up anymore than the older generation? Not according to a new survey, which reveals that our grandparents were not only happier than us, but wiser too. Photo: Alamy The skills that made them so content are at risk of disappearing forever, according to flower experts Interflora . Their survey, carried out on more than 1,500 grandchildren nationwide in time for today's Grandparents' Day , forms part of their campaign to bring the wisdom of the grandparental generation to those younger. The survey found that half of people agreed that their grandparents were more principled than today’s young people, but also happier, wiser, more caring and more social. These positiities could be attributed to the older generation’s lack of reliance on modern technology, rather to focus on traditional skills.

Although technology has a huge impact on improving many aspects of our world, it is also crushing other elements into the dust. Interflora’s survey revealed that 84 per cent of those surveyed were concerned that the traditional skills so favoured by the older generation are at risk of crumbling away. “It would be an enormous shame for the traditional skills and positive world outlook of the older generation to be lost,” said Interflora spokeswoman Bethany Day. “That’s why we’re calling for grandchildren everywhere to spend quality time with their grandparents, learn from them and show their appreciation.” Photo: Gamma Keystone The 10 skills that could die out forever – if we’re not careful Letter writing Sewing Cooking from scratch Correct spelling and grammar Basic home maintenance Proper ‘courtship’ Meeting people without use of the internet Map reading Remembering phone numbers Formal dancing telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:47:56.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
