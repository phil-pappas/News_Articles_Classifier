Surat, Bharuch and parts of south Gujarat felt the quake. Strong tremors were also felt in different parts of Nepal including Kathmandu. Electricity was cut off in Srinagar. Noida, the business centre near Delhi felt the tremors for about a minute and a half as the lights fluctuated when the quakes were felt. Phone lines were down in Srinagar (J&K) due to the Earthquake. Tremors were felt in Shimla, Srinagar, and Chandigarh.\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, The earthquake was centered in the mountainous Hindu Kush region, about 75km (46 miles) south of Faizabad. Pakistan has put its army on alert. The second quake struck at 4.00pm measuring 4.8 at Farkhar in Afghanistan. Some died in stampede at a girlâ€™s school when the earthquake hit Pakistan.\nPeople in the Indian Capital, Delhi ran out of high risers into the streets when they felt the tremors. The Delhi metro also briefly halted.\nPeople in Pakistan too were shocked at the first sign of the quake and ran out of their houses. They also went on record saying that they had never experienced anything like this before.\nThe quake occurred 200km from the ground surface and that is the reason the shaking of the ground surface was less than it would have been for a shallower earthquake of the same magnitude.\nThis region is earthquake susceptible. In 2005 a 7.6 magnitude earthquake killed about 75,000 people. Nepal has still not been able to recover from the earthquake devastation which killed 9,000 people.\nThe Indian Prime Minister has has extended his assistance to Afghanistan and Pakistan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:45:42.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
