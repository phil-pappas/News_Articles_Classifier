The honoree, Gregory Doyle of SEACOR, signaled the beginning of construction by pressing a button to cut the first piece of steel.\nThe 610-foot tankers are a continuation of the ECO MR Tanker design, offering improved fuel efficiency and incorporating the latest environmental protection features, including a Ballast Water Treatment System and reduced emissions. When delivered, the tankers will be among the most fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly tankers anywhere in the world.\n\"We are pleased to begin construction on another tanker for our customer and partner, SEA-Vista,\" said Kevin Graney , vice president and general manager for General Dynamics NASSCO. \"These tankers represent the evolution of new, innovative green ship technology, offering our customer a competitive advantage.\"\nDesigned by DSEC, a subsidiary of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) of Busan, South Korea , the tanker's ECO design achieves improved fuel efficiency through several features, including a G-series MAN ME slow-speed main engine and an optimized hull form. The tankers will have conversion-capable, dual-fuel-capable auxiliary engines and the ability to accommodate the future installation of an LNG fuel-gas system and tanks.\nAs noted by SEA-Vista: \"The tankers will play a key role in offering SEA-Vista's customers the most modern and fuel efficient vessels available as they address their Jones Act transportation requirements for the movement of their current and projected crude oil and refined product volumes in the U.S.\"\nFor more information about General Dynamics NASSCO, please visit www.nassco.com .\nFor more information about SEACOR Holdings Inc., please visit www.seacorholdings.com .
