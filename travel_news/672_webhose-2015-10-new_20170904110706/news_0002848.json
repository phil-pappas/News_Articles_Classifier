As the face of business travel changes, the largest accommodation booking platform in the world has responded with additional, highly tailored services designed to give today's road warriors an easier and more rewarding experience, as well as better value for employers. \"Among Booking.com customers, location is the primary factor when selecting a place to stay when travelling for work. With around a third of US business bookings on Booking.com made at places that are not hotels, there's also a clear and growing desire for something different,\" explains Ripsy Bandourian, Senior Product Owner, Booking.com. \"The traditional executive crash-pad of the past may have had its day. Today's business travellers wear more guises and require more choice, control and flexibility over where they choose to rest their heads than ever before. Understanding these trends and listening to our customers' specific asks, we've shaped our product to best empower business travellers across the world to easily discover, book, and enjoy the best places to stay when travelling for work.\"Enhanced features for business travel on Booking.com highlight those places which are used a lot for business.

Travellers themselves are also given exclusive access to special deals and complimentary extras at select properties, helping to turn a 3-star budget into a 4-star experience. With the majority of business travellers (65%) booking travel themselves and preferring to book directly online, Booking.com for Business provides the additional choice, simplicity, savings and the seamless control they crave. \"We are seeing more and more businesses opting to use Booking.com instead of their current method,\" confirms Bandourian. \"As well as a much broader selection of great places to stay, they get better prices and a simple, trustworthy mobile-enabled experience.
