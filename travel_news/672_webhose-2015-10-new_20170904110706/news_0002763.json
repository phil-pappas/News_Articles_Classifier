Groundbreaking 1980s artist Andy Warhol was a teetotaler who found the scent of Absolut vodka so beguiling that he used it as cologne. This cultural revolutionary, who transformed Campbell’s soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles into Pop Art, became so captivated by the sleek lines of Absolut’s 18th-century apothecary bottle that he decided to paint his own interpretation. \nThe result—a primal image with ethereal power—suggested an equally radical marketing path to Absolut’s importer, Michel Roux: using avant-garde art from rebels like Warhol, Keith Haring, and Damien Hirst on Absolut’s labels and ads. \nWhen this staid Swedish company began backing Warhol’s fashionably Boho crowd, they carried Absolut vodka into their countercultural haunts: the rowdy scene at Studio 54, the gay bars dictating fashion, even Warhol’s studio, The Factory, transforming grandpa’s tipple into a darling of the demimonde. \nAbsolut’s boundary-smashing ad campaign ran for more than 25 years, expanding to iconoclasts in other fields, such as fashion designer Stephen Sprouse, filmmaker Spike Lee, musician Lenny Kravitz, and even the remarkable graphics of Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood. \nThese days, Absolut is backing Indie films, music concerts, and live events, and has just premiered a new limited edition of the Warhol bottle—still available for purchase at press time—to benefit the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.
