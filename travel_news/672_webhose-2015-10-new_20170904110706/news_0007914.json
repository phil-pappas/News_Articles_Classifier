Picking a ship where you’re cruising with like-minded folks helps with the bonding. Theme cruises – whether focused on Star Trek or nudism – assure common ground. There are also ships where a particularly convivial atmosphere reigns. \nHere are the best ships for meeting people. \nNorwegian Cruise Line: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nOn the latest Norwegian ships including the soon-to-debut Norwegian Escape, singles in particular can meet up in a community setting. The ships have a block of cleverly designed 100-square-foot cabins, together in a complex called The Studios. A common lounge is open for drinks, coffee and mingling, including around large plasma TVs. It’s kind of like a fancy dorm at sea for grownups. \nViking Ocean: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nThe line’s elegant 930-passenger Viking Star is set up for socializing. The Viking Living Room is a three-story atrium with comfortable nooks where people gather, including for organized “Knit Chat” sessions. The Explorer’s Lounge encourages conversation with views through double-height glass windows and an amazing collection of curios. The line also encourages people to meet pre-dinner for a Social Traveler’s get together. \nRiver Cruises: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nWith fewer than 200 passengers, open-seating meals and time together on shore excursions (included in the cruise fare), you have plenty of opportunity to bond with your fellow passengers on river cruises. Complimentary wine with lunch and dinner helps the cause. Most onboard will be couples, but singles will also feel at home. \nRegent Seven Seas Cruises: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nWith shore excursions included in your cruise fare, you can mingle with fellow passengers shipboard and on land – tasting wine at a vineyard or doing a bike trek, for instance. The line also encourages a getting-to-know-you atmosphere with events such as its Block Party, where everyone is invited early on in the cruise to gather in stateroom corridors to meet your neighbors over wine. \nSeaDream Yacht Club: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nThe atmosphere on the line’s 112-passenger yachts is akin to a privileged club. If you want to be alone you can be, but the experience can also be like one big dinner party. People invite fellow guests to organized dinner tables (indoors and out) and after several rounds of complimentary drinks you may have opportunity to join a conga line at the pool. \nSeabourn: There are 13 categories of suites in all, ranging in size from 295 to 1,182 square feet (not including balcony space). The largest suite, shown here, is the Grand Wintergarden Suite, which includes a glass-enclosed solarium with a tub and daybed, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a guest bath, a whirlpool, a dining area for six, two bars and three flat-screen televisions.Scroll upScroll down Michel Verdure, Seabourn Cruise Line \nLast Slide Next Slide \nWhile some of the well-heeled passengers may prefer not to chitchat, most come onboard the line’s all-suite ships for the sophisticated social atmosphere, enhanced by luxury accouterments. Seabourn encourages its guests to get to know one another with invites to dinner tables, with an officer or entertainer serving as gracious host. \nUn-Cruise Adventures: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nOn these small ships (the largest has 88 passengers), you eat together, hang out in the lounge together, explore on shore together and get to know both fellow passengers and crew. Shared experiences include off-the-beaten-path adventure, whether hiking, kayaking or learning to stand-up paddleboard. There is down time together too, watching a breaching whale or staring at the stars. \nLindblad Expeditions-National Geographic: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nWith this soft adventure line you can mingle with your fellow passengers on the small ship (the largest carries 148 passenger) and on skiffs or Zodiacs as you go off exploring – in places such as the Amazon and Antarctica. There’s no need for formality. Meals are family style and since cabins are on the small side, the lounge and dining room are the main hangout spots, places for conversation with onboard naturalists. \nAzamara Club Cruises: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nThe line’s two 684-passenger ships operate with a club-like atmosphere that includes open seating in the dining room. Most itineraries are for more than a week, so there’s time to get to know your fellow travelers. Drinks are included in the cruise fare, and so is a special AzAmazing Event on shore. \nOceania Cruises: \nLast Slide Next Slide \nWith open seating in the dining room and a variety of complimentary specialty restaurants, you can organize your own dinner group on Oceania’s 684-passenger and 1,250-passenger ships. A favorite in warm weather is ordering up grilled steak and lobster from the buffet and dining outdoors. Other events including deck parties encourage bonding, as do activities such as cooking classes (on the larger ships) at The Culinary Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:23:55.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
