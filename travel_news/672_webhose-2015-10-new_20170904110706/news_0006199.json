The research includes unit shipment and revenue forecasts; pricing, distribution channel, and market share analyses; market drivers and restraints; a market overview; key conclusions and findings; and a future outlook. The product scope includes exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valves, EGR coolers, and diesel particulate filters for heavy-duty commercial vehicles. All units, prices, and revenue are presented at the manufacturer level and are expressed in US dollars. The base year is 2014. Forecasts are provided from 2015 to 2020, and historical data is provided for 2010 to 2013.\nExecutive Summary-Key Findings\n1 Up to 2 million Class 6-8 trucks will enter the aftermarket for emissions control and aftertreatment components over the next 6 years, driving manufacturer-level revenue from an estimated $ * million in 2014 to $ * million in 2020.\n2 Diesel particulate filters (DPFs) will account for the bulk of the growth?rising from an estimated % of Class 6-8 emissions control and aftertreatment components revenue in 2014 to % in 2020?because of the increasing replacement rate and the high cost of repair.\n3 Frost & Sullivan expects prices to decline across product and service lines, but weighted average price to rise by an estimated % annually as sales of expensive components (e.g., DPFs) grow much faster than less-costly parts (e.g., exhaust gas recirculation [EGR] valves).\n4 Original equipment suppliers (OESs) such as Cummins and BorgWarner capture over % of revenue because this market is still in its infancy and emissions control and aftertreatment systems require a high degree of expertise to maintain and repair.\n5 Aftermarket companies that can remanufacture DPFs and related components for heavy-duty engines could enjoy high growth in this industry.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3290919/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/strategic-analysis-of-the-north-american-class-6-8-emissions-control-and-aftertreatment-components-aftermarket-300165201.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
