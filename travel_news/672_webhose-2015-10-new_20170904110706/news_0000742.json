In plane view: The stunning pictures that show why you... This demi-Eden was named The Emerald Coast and developed as a Guccified retreat to which his posh friends, British Royalty and movie stars could escape, investing it with a red carpet glamour ensuring high prices kept mere mortals at bay.\nEven Princess Diana was drawn here for her last holiday on Dodi Fayed's yacht before her untimely death.\nMy own arrival in this celebrity paradise was less cinematic than Roger Moore's, on a crowded Easyjet flight from Stansted to Cagliari, in the south of Sardinia.\nThe resort is a collection of four 'family friendly' hotels and private villas in the south of Sardinia\nNightly rates at Chia Laguna's Hotel Laguna start from £337 based on two persons sharing a room\nAll the children are given the smart blue and white strip of the Italian national soccer team\nThis is the opposite end of the island to the palatial villas of the Beautiful and the Damned where Silvio Berlasconi entertained Tony Blair as well as leggy starlets at his 68-room Bunga Bunga Palace just sold to the Saudi Royal Family for £350million.\nHowever I was happy to be visiting somewhere much more fun where kicks of a very different kind are to be found.\nThe Chia Laguna resort is a collection of four 'family friendly' hotels and private villas in the south of the island, a lush green landscape with deserted beaches which until a decade ago was roamed only by impoverished goat herders.\nIt is the rural yesteryear Italy of nostalgic films like Cinema Paradiso.\nChia Laguna, is really a village linked by shaded terracotta paths with three swimming pools, nine restaurants, spa, boutiques, pharmacy and a free open air theatre in a spacious piazza where professional singers perform a different musical every night.\nThere are two basic rules of holidays known to all parents.\nOne, if the kids are happy so are the Mums and Dad's. Two, children on holiday, especially teenagers, have enough energy to power the national grid but a low tolerance threshold that finds them moaning after only a couple of days – 'I'm bored'.\n'They see no reason why their gender should stop them playing a game they love.' said Roderick\nChia Laguna, is really a village linked by shaded terracotta paths with three swimming pools\nChia Laguna's solution to channel all this energy is provide a soccer academy for children, aged from six to 16 years old, where they are coached by Premiership heroes they have seen playing on Match of the Day.\nThis allows parents to relax by the pool in the tranquillity of fifty acres of manicured gardens, glass in hand, or work on their tan at one of the two bay protected beaches, shaded by towering sand dunes and rushes.\nSignificantly, in what is new and an important cultural as well as sporting change in society there are many girls among the boys today, their enthusiasm for soccer ignited by the success of the England Ladies team in the recent Women's World Cup.\nOne, feather light Anya Helden from Bromley Kent, aged seven, a passionate West Ham supporter, doesn't seem much bigger than a tot, but every day at the two sessions, in the cool of the early morning and late afternoon, she dribbles the ball like a little Lionel Messi, blonde ponytail flying.\n'Sardinia is the biggest island in the Mediterranean but delightfully empty' said Gilchrist\nCoaches entertain children with 'keepy uppy' games and ten minute matches throughout the day\nAndrew Johnson, who played for Everton and nine times as centre forward for England and Bobby Zamora, another England striker who scored one of the goals of the season for Queens Park Rangers last year, teach the kids how to bend it like Beckham.\nThere are penalty taking contests, 'keepy uppy' games on the well screened astro-turf pitch, where these young tyros juggle a ball from foot to foot without it touching the ground ,and ten minute matches in which the wannabe Wayne Rooney's play with demonic energy.\nSara Heshmati, aged ten, from Ealing South, London, seeks no favours for being a girl and is shrieking 'Long ball Paulo', to a team mate as she races past a much bigger boy to receive a pass.\nAll the children are given the smart blue and white strip of the Italian national soccer team to wear and love it so much they keep it on all day, even at meals.\nAt the end of the week all the children are called on stage at the theatre, given a DVD of their game time\nSara's Dad, Adi, told me: 'These soccer sessions are brilliant. All the children become friends and go swimming together after games. It breaks the ice for parents too. You know what the British are like on holiday. A bit reserved. But we all get together at dinner as well.'\nFilm maker Richard Curtis, who produced Four Weddings and a Funeral as well as creating Live Aid, was one of the Dad's cheering on his son Spike.\nAt the end of the week all the children are called on stage at the theatre, given a DVD of their game time and on the big screen congratulated by John Terry, the Chelsea Captain.\nChia Laguna, built on a gently rising hill with mountains behind ,derives its name from the peaceful lagoon between the resort and the sea, home to a flock of pink flamingos.\nThe four hotels within the resort offer a contrast in styles.\n'All the children become friends and go swimming together after games. It breaks the ice for parents too,' said one of the dads, Adi\nThe high end Laguna, with commanding views of the Mediterranean, appeals to couples seeking a romantic Dolce Vita ambience.\nThe Village Hotel is a collection of family cottages where there is no charge for children under 12.\nSpacia Oasis has more commodious rooms and the rustic Hotel Baia is located right on the beach within sight of a sixteenth century Spanish watch tower.\nFor those too exhausted to walk to the beach, where the swimming, protected by a bay is peaceful and safe, a shuttle bus artfully disguised as a toy train glides guests to their favourite sun lounger.\nThe staff at Chia Laguna, most fiercely proud Sardinians, need no encouragement to shower you with notes about picturesque places you just must visit, like Isola di San Pietro, a pretty fishing village just down the coast.\nThe island lays a fair claim to serve the world's best cuisine. Gilchrist describes the food traditions as 'heroic'\nSardinia is the biggest island in the Mediterranean but delightfully empty unlike it's neighbours, Sicily, Ischia and Capri which are becoming increasingly crowded.\nThe island lays a fair claim to serve the best cuisine in the world and the seafood, shaped by Mediterranean culinary traditions – Octupus roasted in balsamic vinegar, swordfish carapaccio – is heroic. I feasted like a Ducal Prince on a terrace painted white by the moonlight.\nThe kids in the soccer academy were just pulling on their boots as I was leaving. I was sad I was watching their uninhibited delight for the last time.\nI cheered up though when Laguna manager Antonello Cocco breezed by 'La Vita e Bella,' he laughed wolfishly, which translated means 'What A Beautiful Life.' That's close to what they call football – The Beautiful Game. Out here, for these boys and girls, there's no doubting that.\nTRAVEL FACTS The Soccer Academy at Chia Laguna is available at a cost of £387 pp.\nNightly rates at Chia Laguna's Hotel Laguna start from £337 based on two persons sharing a classic room on a half board basis.\nRates also include wi-fi, fitness facilities and beach service.\nContact info@chialagunaresort.com or call +39 070 92393431.\nRead more: © Resort in Sardinia: Discover a Luxury 5-star holiday", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1FYJmZF", "http://en.chialagunaresort.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:34:44.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
