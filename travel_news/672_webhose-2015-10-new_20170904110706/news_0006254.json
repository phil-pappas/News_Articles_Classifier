Prince Philip's adjoining room has plainer dark wood furniture, and the unadorned bedspread is a silky deep maroon. \nTheir quarters are near the stern lounge and deck, \"Princess Diana's favourite area\" when she and Prince Charles honeymooned on the Mediterranean in 1981, duty manager Andrea Bradbury said. \nAt receptions and state dinners, the Queen received world leaders and other VIPs aboard the yacht. To maintain a dignified atmosphere, \"there was no shouting,-Bradbury said. Orders between the 21 Royal Navy officers and 250 Royal Yachtsmen \"were given by hand signals.\" \nBuilt at Clydebank, south of Glasgow, royals used the 5,769-ton, 126-by-17-metre steamship from 1954 until 1997, when it was retired after 696 foreign voyages and 272 visits to British waters. \nVisitors can listen to narrations in 27 languages on audio handsets while exploring five decks, state apartments, crew quarters, the engine room, plus chinaware, silverware, portraits, photos, and a retired Rolls-Royce state car. \nCared for by the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust, a Scottish charity, the popular attraction -- with more than 300,000 annual visitors -- is also available for special events, catered dinners and private tours. \nOn a Canadian note, a photo of Diana greeting her two sons as they stepped aboard Britannia in Toronto harbour is displayed at the entrance and exit. The boys were joining their parents on a 1991 royal visit to Canada. \nQuoted saying: \"Britannia is the one place where I can truly relax,\" the Queen reportedly wept at the ship's decommissioning ceremony. \nReplacement plans never floated through Parliament. \nHIDDEN STREETS \nVisiting High Street has been a must-do since my Glasgow-born grandfather brought me to Edinburgh in 1971. On subsequent visits, I've always enjoyed the bustling Old Town with its cobblestone streets, shops, spired churches, costumed street performers and cafes. \nIn addition to battles, royal intrigue, business and crime, tales of ghosts, deadly plagues, killers and executions both titillate and haunt visitors. \nLife was hard and usually short centuries ago, especially for poor families jammed into tiny, dark and dank alleys called \"wynds\" or \"closes\" -- one of which survives. \nThe Real Mary King's Close is an underground time capsule under the City Chambers, which were built over razed sections of the city in the 1750s. The close contains four streets, stone-walled rooms, plus narrow stairs and alleys, where a plague killed up to half the residents. \nOpened in 2003, the recently redeveloped five-star attraction tallied more than 200,000 visitors last year. \nWhile day manager Graham Mackay said current operators emphasize well-researched history, \"myths\" about apparitions and skeletons in sealed rooms persist. \nMackay's only ghostly tale was a psychic's report of a child's spirit describing her mother fleeing after she became ill. Also heartbroken over her missing doll, the apparition's \"sad feeling vanished\" when the woman provided \"Annie\" with a tartan-clad Barbie. \nMementoes visitors leave beside that doll eventually go to charities, Mackay said. \nOyster shells embedded in a door frame to ward off evil spirits, plus a floral block-printed wall are among the few relics in the close. \nMannequins and recordings behind photos of costumed staff bring stories about long ago close residents alive. One tale features Mary King, a 1630's seamstress. \nTEA IN THE CASTLE \nExploring part of Edinburgh Castle, where my Gramps was billeted as a volunteer during the\"First World War, was fun. \nBut unlike that long-ago visit to the home of the Scottish royals from the 12th century until 1603 when Scotland, England and Ireland united under a single monarch, this time I had afternoon tea. \nFor $32 each -- comparable to some high-class Canadian hotels -- we sampled small, delectable roast beef, egg and salmon sandwiches, tasty tarts and Scottish scones on a balcony overlooking The Tea Rooms, where patrons enjoyed similar treats from towering trays. \nPrimarily a barracks by the 1600s, the castle still has cannons aimed toward city homes and halls are lined with armour, swords and other military memorabilia. \nDamaged by time and 26 sieges, the buildings, streets and ramparts underwent several restorations starting in the early 1800s. The oldest section, St. Margaret's Chapel, dates from the 12th century. \nVisitors can also see the Scottish Crown\"Jewels used for coronations from 1543 until 1651, regimental museums, the National War Memorial and the National War Museum of Scotland. \nWith more than 1.4 million visitors in 2013, this is a busy place. Obviously, the castle's colourful history offers more than good tea. \nANSWERING THE CALL \nOn my last evening, I couldn't resist visiting lush\"Princes Street Gardens and a statue I first saw as a boy in a historic grist mill near Almonte, Ont. \nSculpted by Dr. Robert Tait McKenzie -- a military surgeon, rehabilitation pioneer and artist -- the original of The Call 1914 is in his home, the restored 1832 Mill of Kintail, now a museum owned by the Mississippi Valley Conservation Authority. \nThe 1927 bronze casting of a hatless, seated First World War soldier facing Edinburgh\"Castle with a rifle across his knees was commissioned as: \"A tribute from men and women of Scottish blood and sympathies in the United States of America to Scotland.\" \nThe last time I saw the Scottish-American War Memorial in the Princes Street Gardens was with my late great uncle. This time, 35 years later, one of two poppy wreaths at the base of the memorial was signed by the U.S. Army's commander in Europe. \nDecades have passed. Memories remain. \nNEED TO KNOW \n-- West Jet has seaonal flights to Glasgow from Toronto via Halifax with connections from other Canadian cities. See westjet.com.
