Chengdu is one that has stood out. The south-western city topped the American thinktank Milken Institute’s list of best performing cities in China in 2015. The rankings were based on employment levels, salaries, regional GDP and foreign direct investment among 34 first- and second-tier cities and 232 third-tier cities. Chengdu has received a number of international accolades in recent years: Forbes magazine ranked it as the world’s fastest growing city for the next decade, Fortune magazine rated it as one of the 15 best emerging business cities, while the World Bank has called it “a benchmark city for the investment environment in inland China”. With a dynamic economy, vast market prospects, liveable environment, good government services and international connections, the Sichuan provincial capital has attracted a growing number of top professionals and hi-tech companies. Zou Xueming, founder and chairman of AllTech Medical Systems Zou Xueming, founder and chairman of AllTech Medical Systems, has been in Chengdu for a decade. His company released a series of new products and solutions for its 10th anniversary in September, including in the fields of superconducting magnetic resonance, colour Doppler ultrasound, digital radiography and digital mammography. In the 1980s, the 56-year-old executive was one of the first 100 graduate students sent by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to the United States. He acquired a doctoral degree in nuclear magnetic resonance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1990, going on to become Vice-President of General Electric Healthcare and general manager of its magnetic resonance division in Greater China. Mr Zou returned to China in 2005 and founded AllTech Medical Systems in the Chengdu Hi-Tech Zone. The company developed China’s first 1.5-tesla superconducting MRI system with independent intellectual property rights, breaking the monopoly held by Siemens, GE and Phillips in China. He said the city and its surrounding areas had a solid industrial foundation and could provide his company with what it needs. And the nearby universities and hospitals provided plenty of high-level talent. Attracted by Chengdu’s rich business opportunities and development potential, Dalian Wanda Group, China’s largest private property developer, signed an agreement with the Chengdu government in April, which involved a total investment of at least 102 billion yuan (£10.5bn) during the next five years. The investment will include a Wanda Cultural Tourism City, a top-class international medical centre, a cloud-based e-commerce centre and six Wanda plazas. It is the largest single investment to be made by a private company in a Chinese city. With a proposed investment of 55 billion yuan, construction on the Wanda Cultural Tourism City started in September in Dujiangyan, Chengdu. It will include an indoor ski field, an outdoor theme park, a big mall, a stage show, a movie park, hotels and a bar street. According to Wang Jianlin, chairman of Wanda Group, the project will create 30,000 jobs, be able to host 30 million visitors and generate revenue of 5 billion yuan annually when it opens for business by the end of 2018. With the increasing internationalisation of Chengdu, more and more international air routes now connect the city with other cities around the world. Chengdu mascot Panda Rong Rong Comparatively low living costs, a rich cultural heritage and pleasant environment all make the city very attractive. To attract professional s from home and abroad to star t businesses here and improve innovation, and to encourage venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to invest in Chengdu, the city government this year launched its Entrepreneurial Tianfu programme. The goal is to establish a comprehensive support system for entrepreneurship by 2020, attracting 100,000 technology companies, which could generate annual revenue of 2 trillion yuan. The city has been improving its international competitiveness by developing hi-tech industries such as IT, biopharmaceuticals, aerospace, new energy and high-end equipment manufacturing. Tianfu Software Park, in the south of the city, focuses on the IT industry and has attracted Fortune 500 companies such as IBM, GE, SAP, NEC, Philips, Siemens and Ericsson. Longquanyi district in the east has also become an important production base for FAW Volkswagen, FAW Toyota, Volvo and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, with vehicle production forecast to exceed 1 million units this year. • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:05:10.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
