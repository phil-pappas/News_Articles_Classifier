In the campaign, everyday people get in the zone for the first time while experiencing the next-level performance and sophistication of the all-new 2016 Optima – the Official Vehicle of the NBA – and find an eternally calm Griffin reading the newspaper, playing chess, making the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich or acting as a weather forecaster in the midst of an impressive basketball performance. The multiplatform campaign, which includes television, digital and social media elements, debuts during Kia NBA Tip-Off 2015.\n\" Blake Griffin is a powerful force both on and off the court, and as a brand ambassador, he has helped raise Kia's profile during our rapid transformation over the last few years,\" said Tim Chaney , vice president of marketing communications, KMA. \"Our partnership with Blake has played a significant role in Kia becoming the most recognized automotive brand among basketball fans across the country, and in this new campaign he's back and better than ever with his distinctive deadpan humor.\"\nCreated by David&Goliath, Kia's advertising agency of record, the Griffin spots can be viewed on cable and network NBA programming and on all of Kia's social and digital platforms, including YouTube.com/Kia and Kia.com .\nGriffin Advertising Background\nBlake Griffin's comedic talents and deadpan delivery have made a connection with Optima buyers and basketball fans over several NBA seasons. Kia's partnership with Griffin was born in 2011 following his famous dunk over an Optima to win the Slam Dunk contest. As a Kia brand ambassador, Griffin has helped grow the brand's presence in both basketball and pop culture through national marketing campaigns, commercials and social media. During the 2012-13 NBA season, Kia's ad campaign featured Griffin offering helpful suggestions to younger versions of himself as Kia's available UVO voice-activated infotainment system 1 took his futuristic Optima on a time-traveling musical journey through the mid-1990s and early 2000s. In the 2013-14 NBA season, Griffin and funnyman Jack McBrayer became a crime-fighting dynamic duo in \"The Griffin Force,\" trying to save the world one Kia Optima at a time. For the 2014-15 NBA season, Griffin was cast in the lead role for several big-budget action movies set in the Old West, ancient Rome and an aircraft carrier, each time replacing his scripted mode of transportation – be it horse, chariot or fighter jet – with a Kia Optima.\nAbout the 2016 Kia Optima\nThe all-new 2016 Optima is passionately designed and obsessively crafted with European styling, a refined premium interior and significant ride and handling improvements. Kia's best-selling nameplate challenges the midsize sedan segment with three engine choices, including a new 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder that's mated to a seven-speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT), making the Optima more confident on the road than ever before. The roomier, more luxurious cabin features an impressive level of craftsmanship that comes standard across five trim levels. The all-new Optima is built at Kia's plant in West Point, Georgia .*\nAbout Kia Motors America\nKia Motors America (KMA) is the marketing and distribution arm of Kia Motors Corporation based in Seoul , South Korea.
