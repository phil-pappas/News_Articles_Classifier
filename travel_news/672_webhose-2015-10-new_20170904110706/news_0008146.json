It is tipped that West Australian rookie Cameron Bancroft will be handed a Test debut at just 22 years, to open the batting with Warner, while Khawaja will come in as first drop.\n“I’m not as well credentialed as others, I haven’t seen Cameron Bancroft play for example, but I’ve spoken to Justin Langer and he says he’s the real deal, he’s got a great temperament, good technique, loves batting, likes a tough situation and is a good kid,” Waugh said.\n“That’ll do me as a referral from Justin Langer. He seems like a good choice.\n“Khawaja I think is ready to play for Australia again, Joe Burns deserves an opportunity, he got two 50s last time he played a Test (58 and 66 against India in this year’s Sydney Test).”\nAsked what he expects of the West Indies, who tour Australia from December, Waugh didn’t mince his words.\n“Not much, don’t buy tickets for day four or day five,” he said.\n“To see guys like Chris Gayle prefer to play Twenty20 games over Test cricket doesn’t send a great message to the younger generation.”\n Waugh to Smith: 'trust your own instincts’", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/26/1227583/190767-f57f5c8c-7bcb-11e5-b858-124d84ad5405.jpg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/10/25/DVU_2510_CRI_STEVE_SMITH_SMASHES_NSW_TO_MATADOR_CUP_VICTORY_PKG.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/cricket/former-test-captain-steve-waugh-offers-sound-advice-for-new-skipper-steve-smith/story-fni2fnmo-1227583182897"], "published": "2015-10-27T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:52:00.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
