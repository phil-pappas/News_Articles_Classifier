This includes providing consumers with more information about airline product and service options, showing product images and enabling comparison shopping among airlines. Highlights of the findings include:\nMore than 75% of air travelers said the NDC-based display would make it easier to compare flights and prices and understand the true cost of their flight, compared to how they shop and book travel online today More than 70% of business fliers and 65% of leisure travelers would be more likely to purchase optional airline services if presented with information about the services in an NDC-based display Sixty-three percent of business travelers and 69% of leisure travelers would find it helpful to receive timely promotional offers via text message 68% of business passengers and 64% of leisure passengers would be comfortable with an airline or travel agent informing them about the availability of optional products based on previous purchase data\n“When presented with the opportunity, air travelers welcome the comprehensive shopping information and graphic visual displays that the NDC Standard enables. A substantial majority also look forward to the opportunity to be recognized and to receive personalized offers,” said Aleks Popovich, IATA’s Senior Vice President, Financial and Distribution Services.\nThe survey also revealed the following travel trends: 88% of business passengers and four of five leisure passengers own a smartphone. Seventy percent of business passengers own tablets, as do 60% of leisure passengers Business passengers are younger than leisure travelers, suggesting a “passing of the torch” from older generations of business passengers\nNDC is a travel industry-supported program launched by IATA for the development and market adoption of a new, XML-based data transmission standard that is intended to enhance communications between airlines and travel agents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:11:10.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
