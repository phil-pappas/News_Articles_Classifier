They have also been specially designed to bring local music influences into each hotel to enhance the guest experience by creating a unique and pleasant ambience. Together they have curated a collection of 15-track playlists that capture the essence of three UK cities: London - Kensington, Glasgow and Liverpool. Drawing on inspiration from local artists, musical landmarks and the many riffs, beats, melodies and songs that have emerged over the years, each playlist represents a personal journey inspired by the local neighbourhood. The Sunday Socials in London, Liverpool and Glasgow will see Edith, together with Jazzie, Dave and Mylo bringing the community together to experience the perfect blend of live DJ sets, food & local conversation. Guests will be taken on a musical journey through the sounds of the neighbourhood, with tracks from each of the playlists. The free Sunday Socials will take place between 1pm – 7pm on the following dates for people to join: • Hotel Indigo London Kensington - Earl’s Court – 1st November • Hotel Indigo Liverpool – 22nd November • Hotel Indigo Glasgow – 29th November Edith Bowman says: “I love making playlists and giving them to people as presents; I used to make them for people I was going to interview when I first started my job. It’s a very thoughtful and enjoyable thing to do for someone. In this case, I did it for three of my favourite places: London Kensington, Liverpool and Glasgow. I’m excited to share some of the tracks at the Sunday Socials alongside Jazzie B, Dave and Mylo. It’s nice to have something to look forward to on a Sunday before the week starts again so I hope people come down and join us for some food, music and lots of fun.” For Liverpool, Dave McCabe has paired iconic melodies from The Beatles and The Beach Boys with tracks by Nirvana, The La’s and Neil Young. In Glasgow, Mylo has drawn inspiration from some of Scotland’s biggest names, blending Franz Ferdinand with Primal Scream and John Paul Young. Jazzie B has mixed his personal experience with musical history to shape his playlists for London-Kensington. You’ll find David Bowie mixed with Aswad, Curtis Mayfield and Hollie Cook. In addition, Edith has also curated two further playlists inspired by the neighbourhoods surrounding the nine Hotel Indigo properties in the UK and its 19 hotels in Europe, adding Edinburgh, London Tower Hill, London Paddington, York and Birmingham to the UK list and popular destinations across the Channel, including Berlin, Helsinki, Madrid and Rome, into the mix. Music-loving guests can tune into a blend of artists during their stay, from Radiohead to Dusty Springfield, Wolf Alice and Jessie Ware, as well as discover exciting, new local talent, as well as enjoy tracks by some of music’s greats. Tom Rowntree, Vice President of Hotel Indigo, Europe, said, “At Hotel Indigo, the uniqueness of the neighbourhood is woven into every element of the guest experience, from design to menus - and now through our music. We are currently rolling out a new locally inspired music programme for guests and the wider community to enjoy via our new music hub, which launches today.” Just as no two neighbourhoods are alike, no two Hotel Indigo properties are the same. Each is designed to uniquely reflect the local culture, character and history of the surrounding area. Hotel Indigo artfully combines the modern design and intimate service associated with a boutique hotel with the conveniences and consistencies you can expect from staying at one of the world’s largest hotel groups. There are currently 19 Hotel Indigo properties in Europe, 9 of which are in the UK.
