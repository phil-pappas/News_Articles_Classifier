With inter airport events in China and Singapore, as well as the mother show in Germany, it is of course very important to work closely with German airport technology suppliers. As such, we’re delighted to renew our on-going agreement with GATE on the 40th anniversary of the creation of inter airport and we look forward to working together for, at least, another 40 years!” said Stephen Brooks, Chairman of Mack Brooks Exhibitions, the organisers of the inter airport events.\n \n“GATE’s airport exhibition strategy gives members and customers high valued orientation on events worldwide, the inter airport Europe in Munich in particular. The cooperation with the organiser Mack Brooks made this event the largest and most popular for the development in the airport industry and gave this trade its own identity in the aviation world,” said Dieter A. Heinz, President GATE.\n \nThe official signing of the agreement took place at the GATE stand during the tour of the\nexhibition on the opening day of inter airport Europe 2015. Stephen Brooks and Dieter A.\nHeinz signed the new partnership in the presence of Dr Michael Kerkloh, President & CEO\nMunich Airport and President ADV (German Airport Association) and Ralph Beisel, CEO\nADV (German Airport Association). A large number of representatives of the GATE member companies as well as international industry experts joined the ceremony.\n \ninter airport Europe is renowned as the world’s leading event for the airport industry. The\nshow is the first choice for airport operators when it comes to sourcing airport equipment,\ntechnology and services for ground handling, terminal operations, airport IT and airport\ndesign. With its international audience of industry professionals from airports, airlines, air\ncargo carriers and aviation support the exhibition offers suppliers to the airport sector a\nunique international marketing platform. At this year’s 20th International Exhibition for Airport Equipment, Technology, Design & Services, from 6 – 9 October 2015 at the Munich Trade Fair Centre, a total of 676 exhibitors from 44 countries are presenting their products and services. Mack Brooks Exhibitions also holds a series of inter airport events in other regions of the world, such as China and South East Asia.\n \nGATE has been the German umbrella association for airport equipment suppliers since\n1992. The association is a contact point and broker for solving infrastructural tasks in the\nairport sector worldwide. The continuously increasing complexity of logistical challenges,\nsuch as information logistics, goods logistics, passenger handling and ground support\ntogether with the task of linking them into integrated airport technology, calls for expertise\nthat extends far beyond the skills of a single system supplier. GATE bundles this knowledge by uniting German top software, systems and equipment suppliers and their core skills into one strategic alliance. With their products and services, the associated members of GATE offer integrated solutions for optimum airport infrastructure, from terminal and retail design to ground handling.\n \nSource:- Inter Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:35:45.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
