His remains weren't found until 11 years later.\nVictims of the guillotine\nFamous residents include guillotine victims Princess Elisabeth of France and Maximilien Robespierre, architect of the French Revolution and the subsequent Reign of Terror, who lost his own head after taking those of others.\nBones are grouped according to the cemeteries they came from.\nSome are neatly stacked, while others are arranged to create patterns and pictures.\nL'empire de la mort\nMining engineer Louis-Etienne Hericart de Thury was responsible for the renovations that turned the bone-strewn caverns into a visitable mausoleum.\nThe archway inscriptions were also his idea.\n\"Arrete, c'est ici l'empire de la mort!\" (\"Stop! This is the empire of death!\") is a favorite.\nAirbnb has paid up to 350,000 euros ($400,000) to privatize the Catacombs, which includes the financing of renovation works, according to the AFP news agency.\nMeasures have also been put in place to ensure the safety of participants and the preservation of the ossuary.\nAnyone interested in a sleepover 20 meters below the Paris streets -- so deep that screams don't carry -- should visit the Catacombs' listing on Airbnb no later than October 20 at 11.59 p.m.\n10 of the most ...
