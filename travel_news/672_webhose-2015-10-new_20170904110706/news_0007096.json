The judges commented that the Idioms of the World project was not only \"Humorous and engaging\", but also \"A great campaign idea that was extremely well executed.\"\nIdioms around the World bring to life the eccentricities of cultures across the globe. For this campaign, which has already won several awards for creativity and innovative SEO, Verve Search collaborated with V&A featured artist, Marcus Oakley , and gained international coverage right from the start.

The awards, now in its sixth year, sets the industry-wide benchmark in digital stakeholder engagement and honours the best corporate digital communications work in Europe .\nBrittany Golob , editor of Communicate magazine, said: \"Digital plays a role in almost every communications campaign, but it is those that are pushing their limitations in the digital sphere, breaking down barriers and driving innovation that the Digital Impact Awards celebrates. Each year we recognise new achievements and see the industry overcome new challenges. Verve Search use digital to disrupt traditional communications to reach new audiences and new markets.\"\n2015 has proven to be a great year for Verve Search, who has already received several accolades for their client work, including a Commendation Award in the 'Best Use of Content category' at The Drum Search Awards .
