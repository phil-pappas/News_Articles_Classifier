A project that sees her write inspirational notes to stick on the windows of the plane, before a flight. A photo posted by Taylor Tippett (@taylortippett) on Jun 12, 2015 at 9:38am PDT \nThe idea came to Tippett about a year ago, when she was struggling to mend her broken heart after her engagement was called off. \nTippett realised she had been pretty hard on herself, and decided to brighten someone elses day with a note that simply read \"Be Kind To Yourself\". \nSpeaking to the Huffington Post, Tippett said: \"I was being really not nice to myself and I've learned over time how important it is to love yourself. \n\"I was sitting just kind of reflecting and giving myself a pep talk. I was doodling and I found this little notebook that one of my instructors gave me at flight attendant training, and I had a Sharpie right there, so I just wrote down, 'Be kind to yourself.'\" \nAfter posting the image to her Instagram account, the response was huge, leading her to create the Words From The Window Seat project because she \"wanted to let others know they weren't alone.\" \nThe project has become such a hit, the American now has around 122k followers on Instagram. \n&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp; Ad Feedback \nThe flight attendant tries to post a picture during each trip, and said the project has given her a chance to connect with people. \n\" If I'm not encouraging and inspiring others, what am I doing with my life? What am I doing with my time here?\" Tippett said to Seeker Stories. \n\"For my voice to matter and for other people to connect or feel loved or just to feel understood and heard, that is all that matters to me.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:32:49.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
