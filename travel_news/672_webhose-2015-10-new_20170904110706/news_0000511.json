It will be transferred to the National Park Service.\nPresident James Lighthizer says the land was at the centre of the bloodiest one-day battle of the war, on Sept. 17, 1862. The clash left 23,000 men killed, wounded or missing.\nThe trust is now raising funds to protect another 7.2 acres at Antietam and 43 near the state-owned South Mountain battlefield.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:14:34.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
