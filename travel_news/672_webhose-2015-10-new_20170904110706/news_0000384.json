But as it is endemic to the rainforests of the Philippines, its existence is gravely affected by natural habitat loss and hunting. \nSadly, only 400 pairs remain, making it one of the most endangered species in the world today. \nOne such eagle is “Mindanao,” the Philippine Eagle ambassador for education. From the day he was hatched, he, along with 17 other Philippine eagles, has been under the care of the Philippine Eagle Foundation (PEF) through a captive breeding program—a system that breeds and re-introduces raptors to their natural habitat in the efforts to augment the dwindling wild population. \nOver the years, 13-year old “Mindanao” has inspired both locals and visitors of the Philippine Eagle Center in Davao to learn more about its kind. “Mindanao” has helped raise awareness about the delicate situation the eagles are in, as well as PEF’s mission to advocate for its survival and the sustainable use of forest resources towards a better future habitat. \nStarting October 15, 2015, Cebu Pacific, the country’s leading airline, takes Philippine Eagle “Mindanao” under its wing. The adoption of “Mindanao” strengthens the airline’s commitment to act on environmental conservation issues that are greatly linked to the country’s rich biodiversity. \nFor five years, Cebu Pacific will provide food and necessary veterinary care that will help flourish and sustain the well-being of “Mindanao” as one of the country’s prominent national symbols.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:00:11.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
