The Whitney received 550 artworks by more than 75 American artists and the Pompidou got about 300 by some 40 European artists.\nThe Whitney exhibition will show about 100 works from both gifts, including pieces by Robert Adams, Diane Arbus, Cindy Sherman and Christopher Wool.\nAn exhibition at the Pompidou will follow, opening June 9, 2016.\nThe Wagners acquired many of the works when the artists were relatively unknown. They continue to collect.\nThe Whitney relocated from the Upper East Side of Manhattan to the West Side downtown, near the High Line, and reopened in a striking new building designed by Renzo Piano on May 1 of this year. Its exterior spaces, on a series of terraces with varied views of the urban landscape and outdoor art installations, are as much a draw for visitors as the indoor exhibitions.\n___\nOnline video showing views from Whitney terraces: http://youtu.be/Ui_L_388Z7Q\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:00:21.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
