Ad Feedback \nRestoration of the train was completed in April last year, and cost the company $500,0000. \nBetween 150 and 180 passengers would be travelling on the train each day, Bovis said. The majority were from overseas. \nSteam crewman Wayne Mason said the diesel engine would only be used from Picton to Kaikoura. \n\"After that it's fine for the rest of the way.\" \nHe and his fellow crewman Alastair Maciver would still be manning the train in \"light steam\" mode but control would be in the hands of the diesel engine up front. \nRestoration of the Passchendaele began more than 20 years ago and had been a \"full-time job\" for the past few years, Bovis said. \nThe engine was built in the South Island and had been used on freight trains, passenger trains, and even on two royal tours; the Prince of Wales' tour in 1920 and the Duke of York's tour in 1927. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:38:27.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
