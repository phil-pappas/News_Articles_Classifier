Apart from these, there were senior businessmen and investors concerned with this industry at the regional and international levels.\" The aim was to familiarize them with the concept of halal tourism and its services.

He said they can benefit from halal tourism in order to market the Arab region and promote it by linking the sector to Arab culture and traditions.\nAl Fehaid said the magnitude of halal tourism is estimated at 10 percent of the total income of the global travel and tourism sector. The income of the sector reached $145 billion last year. The number of travelers from the Muslim countries reached 108 million. This segment is expected to grow further to reach 150 million by 2020 with returns expected to reach $238 billion.

These include taking advantage of means of communications and the social media in increasing the share of halal tourism in the travel and tourism sector, laying down quality criteria and supporting tourism in the hotels, resorts and restaurants that conform with the standards of this sector. They also include drawing up strategies to attract a segment of tourists interested in halal tourism. \nEarlier, Halabooking.com revealed, at the start of the summit, the popularity of Muslim-friendly holidays is soaring faster than any other travel sector in the world.
