(AP) â€” Federal prosecutors say a Maryland man who offered national-security commentary on Fox News has been charged with fraud for falsely claiming a CIA career.\nAuthorities say they arrested 62-year-old Wayne Simmons of Annapolis Thursday and charged him with fraud against the U.S. and making false statements to the government.\nAn indictment states Simmons lied about having a 27-year career with the CIA as an \"Outside Paramilitary Special Operations\" officer. The indictment alleges that Simmons made the claim as he sought security clearances and in seeking work as a defense contractor.\nAs recently as April, Simmons was identified on air on Fox radio as a \"Fox News contributor.\"\nHowever, Fox News spokeswoman Carly Shanahan said Simmons was never more than a guest on the network and was not a paid commentator.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:07:25.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
