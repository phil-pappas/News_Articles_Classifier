Alaska is the only airline to operate Honor Flights for veterans in the state of Alaska. \n\"We work continually throughout the year to make these flights happen and we deeply appreciate our partners at Alaska Airlines,\" said Ron Travis, president of Last Frontier Honor Flight. \"When a veteran who is in their 90s looks at us with tears in their eyes to say thank you, we are honored to do it.\" \nVeterans in the state of Alaska are selected for Honor Flights by age and can apply for the program by visiting the Last Frontier Honor Flight's website at http://www.lastfrontierhonorflight.com/ .
