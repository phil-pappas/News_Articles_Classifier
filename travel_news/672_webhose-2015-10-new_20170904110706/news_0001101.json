Well, it’s an interesting way to raise money for charity!

Admittedly it would have been nice to have bettered our record — but we are still the World Record holders at the end of the day.” Guessing it would be pretty breezy up there. Picture: Nick Ansell/PA Source: AAP \nSouthend Hospital Charitable Foundation praised those who took part for their bravery. \n“It takes a lot of nerve to take off all your clothes in front of complete strangers, plus the world’s media,” spokeswoman Lucy Thomas-Clayton said. \n“We would like to say a massive thank you to everyone who was brave enough to bare all and raise such a huge amount of cash for our vitally important cause.” Nude cruise anyone?
