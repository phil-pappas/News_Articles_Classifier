Some guests were puzzled, but this was shortly overcome with delight as they arrived at the Air Seychelles VIP Lounge where they received a warm welcome by the CEO of Air Seychelles, together with the management team of Denis Private Island. \nThe guests were re-assured that everything was in order, and they were invited to this special ceremony as the aircraft that they would be boarding is a new addition to the Air Seychelles domestic twin otter fleet. Furthermore, this new aircraft has been named “Isle of Denis” and today would be its first flight to the island itself. The guests were delighted to be part of this event, sharing a momentous day for both the airline and Denis Island. Each guest was presented with a certificate for having been part of this inaugural flight aboard the new aircraft. \nDespite the clouds and the rain, the aircraft took off punctually at 11:45 and arrived at Denis Island in 30 minutes. On the island, they were warmly welcomed by the team, and the guests awaited their departure back to Mahe. The Denis Private Island team expressed their gratitude that Air Seychelles had recognized their “little corner of paradise” and most importantly how they have supported a Seychellois owned and operated business. By delivering this new aircraft to their fleet, it in turn allows Denis Private Island to offer a superior standard of service to their guests. “Such a gesture strengthens our partnership allowing us to deliver a great service, whereby enhancing trade and ultimately tourism flows to the island,” says PR Manager Nicole St.Ange of Denis Private Island. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
