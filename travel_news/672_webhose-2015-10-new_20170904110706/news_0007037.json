In the dim light of dawn, fresh powder snow brightened the high country's typically sombre appearance. \nThe climb offers few technical challenges. Cheroot smoking Lord George Paget, an officer in the Crimean War, could have taken his horse up and along Paget Ridge; although on the day of our expedition his mount might have skidded on patches of snow, a fate less dangerous than his ride into Tennyson's Valley of Death. \nWe set off through tall snow tussock, our boots flicking snow. A singing skylark of European ancestry rejoiced in the twilight accompanied by the subdued cries of New Zealand pipits. \nWhile Molesworth country is New Zealand in character to its deep heart's core, several northern hemisphere animals inhabit its wide horizons. Evidence of one of these emerged when the sun cast shadows on a network of footprints in the snow: hares are hard to see, but they can't hide their tracks. \nThe Paget Ridge walk provides views across a topography peppered with interesting historical and literary references. On Paget Ridge's eastern side (beside the Crimean Range) Nightingale Stream flows gently, recalling the persona of the Lady with the Lamp. \nTo the west the Spenser Range sets a backdrop to Lake Tennyson, named after the British poet laureate. From the lake's outlet the Clarence River makes a 230km journey to the sea. \nCloser at hand we could look down on the road climbing over Island Saddle, one of the highest roads open to the public. (Don't attempt the saddle in winter) Ad Feedback \nThe sun had melted much of the previous night's snowfall as our boots slid down tongues of shingle and where prostrate vegetation stabilises the slopes. And far below the Clarence River gleamed in the sunlight. In summer, keen fishermen answer the siren calls of its clear waters but on the drive home we weren't tempted by frost-fringed pools. \nThe country beyond Hanmer created memories for men who built the road and accompanying pylons that still command centre stage in the Clarence Valley. Today another generation makes forays along the road seeking adventure and high country memories. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:10:20.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
