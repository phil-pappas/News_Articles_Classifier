FARE (Food, Allergy, Research & Education) and the Teal Pumpkin Project understand the challenges parents and children face during this candy-filled holiday, and have started a nationwide movement to offer an alternative for children who cannot partake in the usual fare.\nBy encouraging families to offer non-food options this Halloween, like scented pencils, stickers, small toys and erasers, the Teal Pumpkin Project hopes to transform this holiday into something every child can enjoy and participate in.\nWant to take part? Here's how you can have a safe and fun Halloween this year!\nJoin more than 100,000 families by pledging your support for the Teal Pumpkin Project . Paint and display a teal pumpkin, which shows that you support allergy awareness and a food-free Halloween. Make sure to print out a free sign from FARE to place next to your pumpkin. Offer only non-food items at your door for trick-or-treaters this year. If you really want to help take charge of Halloween, you can spread awareness of Halloween-related food allergies by holding your own fundraiser. The Teal Pumpkin Project suggests a few easy ways to raise money, including hosting your own pumpkin walk, a teal pumpkin painting party, a teal-painted pumpkin sale, neighborhood collections, and having a food and candy-free Halloween party.\nFor more information, contact FARE and Teal Pumpkin Project at 1-800-929-4040", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/05/32/5a/FARE_TPP_RGB.jpg", "http://tealpumpkin.org/"], "published": "2015-10-06T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:52:48.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
