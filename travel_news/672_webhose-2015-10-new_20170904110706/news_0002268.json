Marriott International recently launched an original podcast series, The Wandernaut Show, providing listeners an opportunity to scratch beyond the surface of the world at work. The show features light-hearted, authentic conversations that tackle topics related to workplace dynamics – all in an accessible and entertaining format. In recent episodes, David Rodriguez , Marriott's Executive Vice President and Global Chief Human Resources Officer, mixes it up with show host, Alex Wandernaut, to dissect those over-used business buzzwords – and have a little fun.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279302LOGO\nHave you ever been sitting in a meeting when someone says, \"Let's leverage that synergy to ideate on an innovative strategy that our matrixed team of high-potentials can execute against to deliver high impact, game-changing results.\" Ugh! Listen in as Dr. Rodriguez gets to the truth behind some of today's trending buzzwords in the workplace.\n\"There are a lot of conversations happening about the evolving workplace,\" stated Rodriguez. \"We decided to create a podcast series, something with a bit of an unexpected twist, to take the spirited dialogue we have about work and share it with the world in a snackable and entertaining way.\"\nThe first six episodes of the original podcast series explored the disruptive forces unleashing accelerated generational change and the path to employee wellbeing and sustainable organizational effectiveness. In the latest episodes, Rodriguez talks with host Alex Wandernaut to decode business jargon such as high-potentials, innovation and the ubiquitous matrix organization. (Hint: Every organization is \"matrixed\" whether they recognize it or not.) Listen in to hear for example, why many organizations may have it wrong in their approach to attract and retain top talent. The Wandernaut Show will continue to evolve with more topics related to the world at work. Whether you work for Marriott, want to work for Marriott, or your travel brings you into the world of Marriott as a guest, we are all unified by this thing called work, so let's talk about it.\nListeners can access The Wandernaut Show below or subscribe via SoundCloud and iTunes .
