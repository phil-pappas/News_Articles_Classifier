Among the hotel barges offering 10% off per cabin is L’Art de Vivre in Burgundy for its April 10th and 17th departures; the Anjodi on the Canal du Midi in the Languedoc-Rousillon region for its March 20th and 27th departures; and the Rosa in Gascony for its April 17th and 24th departures. These “specials” must be booked by December 31, 2015.\n“Along with comfortable temperatures, a landscape in bloom and fewer tourists, Spring is an ideal time for a leisurely hotel barge cruise,” said Derek Banks, managing director of European Waterways. “The cruises wind their way through some of the country’s most renowned vineyards, visit medieval towns, châteaux, cathedrals and colorful local markets. And the cuisine and wines served onboard reflect the region’s gastronomic tradition.”\nThe Art of Fun\nL’Art de Vivre hotel barge truly lives up to its name, “the art of living.” It offers a real taste of Burgundian good life” as it cruises serenely along the Canal du Nivernais, one of France’s most picturesque canals. Among the highlights is a visit to the medieval village of Noyers-sur-Serien and its food markets; a tour of the stately, 800-year-old Château de Bazoches , and a wine tasting of Chablis and Petit Chablis at a renowned Domaine.\nThe Anjodi ’s cruise along the 300 year-old Canal du Midi takes guests from the sunny shores of the Mediterranean across lagoons full of migrating birds past ancient Cathar cities such as Carcassonne and canalside vineyards bursting into life in the Spring. This tree-lined canal, with its elegant arched bridges and ever-present towpath, is renowned for its beauty and historical significance.\nHighlights of the cruises aboard the Rosa on the Canal de Garonne include visits to fortified medieval towns known as bastides , and a crossing of a magnificent 1,000 foot long aqueduct.\nGuests also visit artisan producers to learn about and sample local specialties such as foie gras and Armagnac .\n“Every European Waterways cruise offers memorable experiences particular to each region, whether it is Burgundy or further south in Gascony and the Midi, and Springtime in France has its own unique appeal” said Banks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:14:21.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
