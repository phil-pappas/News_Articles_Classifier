Morocco has four Imperial Cities and each of them is a capital at least once and several times for a couple. They are: Fes (Fez), Marrakesh, Rabat and Meknes.Fes: It is Morocco's big cultural destination. Fes el Bali (Old City) is an authentic chaos of a place where it is impossible to not get lost. The pathways with chipped plaster-work and attractive old doors attract everybody to take photos on every corner, while the foul-smelling tanneries are one of Fes' most popular attractions for those who can handle the smell.Rabat: It has a heavy French influence and houses of the King and embassies.
