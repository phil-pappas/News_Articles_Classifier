Manresa joins fellow three stars The French Laundry and The Restaurant at Meadowood, which have held the honor perennially. Additionally, Benu and Saison retain their distinction of three stars, having earned them in the previous year's guide. Worldwide, only about 100 restaurants hold three stars.\nIn the two-star category, seven restaurants across the region offer \"excellent cuisine, worth a detour.\" Moving up in the ranks are Campton Place and Commis . At Campton Place, Chef Srijith Gopinathan is serving from a menu that highlights the Indian and South Asian flavors of his heritage. Chef James Syhabout's contemporary establishment, Commis, is the first two-star restaurant in the East Bay and continues to impress Michelin inspectors with his flavors and technique.\nWith more one stars than ever, 38 Bay area restaurants offer diverse yet quality cuisine. Standouts include new hotspots from storied Michelin chefs: Chef Mourad Lahlou's eponymous Mourad joins Aziza in offering delicious Moroccan cuisine worthy of a star and Chef Melissa Perello (Frances) is impressing diners with bold and fun flavors at her new spot, Octavia. Also new and noteworthy is The Lazy Bear , a popular former pop-up, and Kin Khao , a Thai Bib Gourmand that is being promoted to one star. The list also welcomes newly located All-Spice, Al's Place, Aster, Californios, Commonwealth, Lord Stanley, Nico, Omakase, Rasa, Sushi Yoshizumi and Wako.\n\"The number of new restaurants in all categories, including Bib Gourmands, demonstrates the growth and fortitude of the level of cuisine found on the West Coast,\" says Michael Ellis , international director of the MICHELIN Guide. \"Over the last 10 years, our inspectors continue to be more impressed with the level of cooking that can be found across the entire region.\"\nThe MICHELIN Guide San Francisco Bay Area & Wine Country 2016 goes on sale Wednesday, Oct. 21 , for $18.99 .
