It's happened to me many times, leaving me frustrated and annoyed. I've been asking myself for years why there wasn't a product that would solve this dilemma. I called countless automotive stores, walked tons of aisles, even searched Yahoo when Google results turned up nothing. I drove myself crazy trying to find a product to solve this problem. So I decided to take matters into my own hands and make a product that would keep a vehicle's side windows clean and dry, while maintaining a factory appearance.\" -- Edwin Phillip , Founder & CEO of ViperSwiper™ .\nViperSwiper™, the world's first ever Side Window Wiper, is a patent pending, no hassle, easy to attach wiper, designed to keep side windows clean and clear, providing maximum visibility.\nThe Side Window Wiper is durable, reliable, and best of all it is practically invisible, merging flawlessly with any car's original design. Simple and understated, but with results users will see and love.\nKickstarter is the largest funding platform for creative entrepreneurs in the world. Each day, tens of thousands of people become backers of projects by pledging funds, thus becoming the \"earliest adopters\" of new, innovative products and companies. When ViperSwiper™ discovered Kickstarter, they instantly recognized it as an important funding strategy that would shape both their own and their supporters motivation to bring this first ever product to the auto accessory industry.\n\"There is no question that our campaign on Kickstarter is a huge part of our future. ViperSwiper™ Side Window Wiper is just the first of several products being designed and brought to market at this very moment. Now the idea of having the resources to release a full line of ViperSwiper™ branded products means everything to us and our supporters,\" said Phillip.\nViperSwiper™ will be launching its Kickstarter campaign with the goal of funding the production and distribution of the Side Window Wiper. The chance to be one of the first to own a pair of Side Window Wipers will start at only $20 .\nViperSwiper™'s mission is to spread the message that they are dedicated to making car owners experiences with their vehicles easier, by creating products that make the work of maintaining a car more convenient.\n\"We greatly appreciate you backing, sharing, and spreading the word about our Kickstarter project\" , says Phillip.\nContact ViperSwiper ™ to learn more about the Kickstarter campaign , or to talk with founder & CEO, Edwin Phillip , about this innovative new to market product!\nMedia Contact:\nEdwin Phillip\n(917) 635-2424\nEmail\nwww.ViperSwiper.com\n@viperswiper\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/274965\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/274966\n releases/viperswiper-side-window-wiper-launches-a-fundraising-campaign-on-kickstarter-300156141.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151007/274966", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151007/274965", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1147209375/side-window-wiper-0", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.viperswiper.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/ViperSwiper-107568092921894", "https://twitter.com/viper_swiper", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH22519&Transmission_Id=201510080830PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH22519&DateId=20151008", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/viperswiper-side-window-wiper-launches-a-fundraising-campaign-on-kickstarter-300156141.html", "https://instagram.com/viperswiper/", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=291969", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/274965", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151007/274966"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:52:02.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
