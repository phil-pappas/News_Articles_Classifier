Expanding to Montreal opens up the service to an additional 2.2 million people, growing the total number to about 8.5 million people across the country.\n\"As the company that delivers two out of three parcels ordered online, we want to continue to introduce services that offer consumers the control and convenience they want in their delivery experience,\" says René Desmarais, Senior Vice-President, Parcels at Canada Post. \"We learned a lot from our experiences in Toronto and Vancouver , and we're looking forward to bringing more merchants on board in Montreal .\"\nDelivered Tonight is another example of how retailing and Canada Post's delivery options are changing rapidly in response to growing consumer demand. In May 2015 , Canada Post launched another innovative service, FlexDelivery TM , which allows customers to direct their online orders to a post office near their workplace, their child's caregiver, their cottage or a travel destination (or all of the above).\nAbout Canada Post\nCanada Post is the country's leading provider of electronic commerce and customer communication solutions.
