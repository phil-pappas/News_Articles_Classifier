This attitude is different from many other European nations and makes Britain a good entry point for companies looking to expand and establish good track records in developed countries. Danae Kyriakopoulou, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said China ’s interest in Britain has shifted more towards technology-based investment. “Chinese companies are now using their capacity to invest abroad as an opportunity to not only make lucrative financial returns but also get hold of valuable know-how in terms of project management in the operation of key infrastructure and other projects,” she said. Previously, it was common for the Chinese to act as fi nancial investors only. In 2012, China Investment Corp, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, bought an 8.68 per cent stake in Thames Water Utilities Ltd and a 10 per cent stake in Heathrow Airport Holdings. \"If you’re a global company you look at various construction management processes and different designs and you’re more prone to look at how you innovate approaches to meet construction standards.” Charlie Cornish, Chief Executive of Manchester Airport In 2011, Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings bought the British utility company Northumbrian Water for £2.4 billion. But since then Chinese companies have altered their tactics and are now bidding for contracts to use the infrastructure sector as a springboard to demonstrate their technical expertise. The £800 million investment by Beijing Construction Engineering Group in the Airport City project in Manchester is one such highprofi le project. The Chinese developers took a 50-50 split with Britain’s Carillion. Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airport, said the Beijing company’s international perspective made it unique in the bidding process to build the Manchester Airport City. “If you’re a global company you look at various construction management processes and di erent designs and you’re more prone to look at how you innovate approaches to meet construction standards,” he said. The airport is one example of the infrastructure projects in England’s manufacturing regions and many more opportunities exist as the government presses ahead with its Northern Powerhouse strategy to generate growth. When Chancellor George Osborne visited China in September, he shared with potential investors his vision for the Northern Powerhouse and encouraged Chinese investors to look into the opportunity. The scheme was proposed to boost economic growth in north England, particularly in the “core cities” of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. The proposal was based on urban agglomeration with the aim to rebalance the British economy away from London and the south-east. Serkan Bahceci, director of infrastructure research at JP Morgan Asset Management, said that because the British government had given its support to the Northern Powerhouse strategy it would be attractive to Chinese investors as an overall idea. • Find more fascinating articles at China Daily • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:51:13.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
