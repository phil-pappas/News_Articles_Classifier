Service experts, Quintessentially, will be given access to Heathrow’s retail operation over the next three months in order to survey the airport’s current retail offering and consult with passengers, commercial partners, and staff. Quintessentially will review Heathrow’s full retail proposition including shops, restaurants and services such as Personal Shopping, Shop & Collect, and Reserve & Collect. \nFollowing its review, Quintessentially will provide Heathrow with a full, independent analysis complete with recommendations based on their expertise in service across the globe. The report will be designed to complement Heathrow’s own expertise in travel retail, helping the airport set a new benchmark for service standards and offer passengers the best airport service in the world. \nJonathan Coen, Retail Director at Heathrow, explained: “Over the past 30 years, Heathrow has been at the forefront of travel retail on a global scale. We are delighted that we have been consistently recognised by our customers, but we cannot be complacent. This initiative is about building on our strengths, listening to our passengers and surrounding ourselves with experts in service.” \nFiona Noble, Managing Director at Quintessentially, added: “Service is such an intangible concept, but so powerful when you get it right, inspiring loyalty, passion and advocacy. We are proud to be working with Heathrow on this innovative brief and look forward to working together to build some recommendations that will enable them to continue their leadership in delivering surprising and innovative service propositions that set the standard both in the industry and beyond.” \nThe announcement comes ahead of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) exhibition and conference in Cannes (18 – 23 October). Heathrow will be looking to engage businesses partners suppliers at the conference to provoke discussion with the view to raising the standards of the retail experience, with the ultimate aim of providing a better service for passengers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:18:55.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
