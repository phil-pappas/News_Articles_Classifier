Much like airline prices, tickets to Disney parks would cost more during weekends and around major holidays, and less during the weekdays and low tourist season.\nWith the popularity of franchises like Frozen and Star Wars , attendance at the Disney parks has been at record levels for the past three years, according to WSJ. While this is indeed a good problem to have, it also means that visitors experience long wait times for rides, as well as gate closings--not exactly what people coming to the “Happiest Place on Earth” would expect.\nThis change in pricing comes amidst a number of changes to the domestic Disney parks. For one, Disney has been experimenting with using technology to manage crowds. For example, its “My Magic Plus” wristbands allow customers to reserve times for rides and meals before their arrival. And Disney is continuing to expand its parks. In August, Disney announced that it would add Star Wars-themed lands to parks in Anaheim and Orlando.\n© Peter Ptschelinzew/Getty Images Crowds outside the Magic Kingdom castle at Disney World in Orlando, Florida.\n ", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf8xIY.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf0y37.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA28Nb&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;U.S.", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;travelnews&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&qu", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA42cl9.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Disney", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeT3ye.img&quot;}}", "http://www.newsy.com/partners/msn/mrss/category/Newsy_Business/5/&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA42cl9.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;U.S.", "http://fortune.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf7LIi.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA2e9Q&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-parks-consider-higher-prices-during-busy-times-1443960001", "http://www.newsy.com/videos/disney-considers-park-pricing-based-on-demand-1&quot;,&quot;shareUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/disney-considers-park-pricing-based-on-demand/vi-AAf8d8n&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;Newsy&quot;,&quot;sourceLogo&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Disney"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:08:18.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
