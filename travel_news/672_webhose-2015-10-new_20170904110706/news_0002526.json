Since 2009, Mr Allcott and his colleagues have helped individuals and businesses across the UK to cut stress levels and to work more efficiently. Mr Allcott says that one of the easiest ways to improve productivity is to reform your email habits. Aside from the fact that almost everyone uses email, the inbox is a very personal space where people spend a lot of time. “If you think about the psychology of the inbox space, most people use their inbox as their orientation in the morning, their to-do list, their archive, and the place where they are holding messages while they wait for someone to reply,” says Mr Allcott. “When considering an email, your brain must work out which of those things the message relates to.” Rather than using the main inbox as a place to work from, Mr Allcott recommends setting up a series of folders in which you file your messages, based on their content. For example, you might use an “Action” folder to keep any emails that require a lengthy reply. This then effectively becomes your to-do list. Think about an email once, move it, and then what you end up with in your Action folder is just the messages where you need to take action “Filing and moving messages allows you to see the wood from the trees,” says Mr Allcott. “Your inbox becomes just the place where things land. That’s where you make your decisions, and then the folder structure is where you work from. It creates real clarity.” While some might dismiss this idea as more effort than it’s worth, Mr Allcott explains that the strategy has a transformative effect on the psychology of your inbox. “Your short-term memory doesn’t want to hold 15 or 20 things at once,” he says, “If you have 100 messages in your inbox and some of them are off the screen, you create a stress based around the fear that you might be overlooking something that’s not on the first page. “Even if you have 20 messages sitting in front of you, you’ll be stressed because you’ll need to go back over those 20 items to work out how to process them.” “Think about an email once, move it, and then what you end up with in your Action folder is just the messages where you need to take action.” Much of the strategy that improves productivity is common sense, says Mr Allcott. But common sense is not commonly applied. “Doing the simple things really well, and being aware of how you manage them, makes a huge difference.” • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:29:34.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
