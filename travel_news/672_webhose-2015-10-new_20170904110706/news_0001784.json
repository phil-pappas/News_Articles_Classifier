This season, Hankook Tire was curious to know what spooky ideas Americans have for their cars in its latest Gauge Index.\nAccording to the Hankook Tire Gauge Index, thirty-six percent (36%) of Americans would dress their car as a superhero for Halloween. Coming in second place is something a little scarier, as fourteen percent (14%) said a vampire is the way to go for their vehicle. And although it may be the easiest costume concept to execute, mummy came in third place with eleven percent (11%), closely followed by a celebrity costume at ten percent (10%).\nWith the spotlight on the 2016 presidential race, a political figure might be an obvious choice for Americans. However, the Hankook Tire Gauge Index found that this idea is the least popular choice with eight percent (8%) of Americans electing this costume, tied with a witch also at eight percent (8%).\n\"Our quarterly Hankook Tire Gauge Index continually sets the tone for new insights on American drivers' car behaviors and opinions. This season's results are some of our most interesting to date,\" said Henry Kopacz , Public Relations and Social Media Manager, Hankook Tire America Corp.\nThe Hankook Tire Gauge Index is a quarterly survey of Americans that uncovers their attitudes and opinions about all things related to driving.
