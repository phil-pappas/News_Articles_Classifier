However, the data still outperformed analysts’ forecasts of an increase of just 3.9 per cent. More Fantasy sports groups fight for survival \nRichard Solomons, IHG chief executive, said: “Looking ahead to the remainder of this year, we are encouraged by current trading trends and remain confident in the outlook.” \nRegional figures for revenue per available room in the quarter were up 4.3 per cent — 7.1 per cent in Asia, the Middle East and Africa and 7.8 per cent in Europe, fuelled by “solid trading in Germany, and double digit growth across southern Europe and Russia . . . reflecting signs of recovery in these markets” — but down 0.7 per cent in Greater China, as occupancy growth was offset by a decline in room rates, the company reported. \nAnalysts had been expecting growth of 0.8 per cent in China. However, the company noted that revenue per available room in mainland China was up 2.1 per cent. \nIn September, IHG suffered a share price wobble as fears that global geopolitical and macroeconomic issues would hurt demand appeared to materialise when its US peer Host Hotels & Resorts trimmed its earnings guidance amid weak demand in August. A number of US hotel real estate investment trusts, including La Quinta and Pebblebrook, also cut guidance last month, sparking concerns that expansion by large hotel operators has not been matched by rising demand. \nIHG continued its pursuit of an “asset-light strategy” of reducing its property portfolio while retaining management contracts to operate the hotels. In July, the group sold its flagship Hong Kong hotel for $938m — well over the $298m valuation for the building. The completion of the sale of InterContinental Hong Kong “marks the successful conclusion of our major owned asset disposal programme”, Mr Solomons said. \nActivist investors including Nelson Peltz and more recently US hedge fund Marcato have been scrutinising the group’s management in recent years. Last year, the company returned more than $1bn to shareholders, including a $763m special dividend in May. \nIn July, the FT reported that IHG had held early stage talks with Starwood Hotels & Resorts over a union to create the world’s largest hotel group, after Starwood effectively put itself up for sale in April. IHG responded that it was not at that time in talks with Starwood with a view to a combination of the businesses. There is also chatter that the Holiday Inn owner is reportedly close to buying luxury hotel chain Fairmont. \nIHG shares are up 6.5 per cent in the last 12 months, ahead of the FTSE 100 which has climbed just 1.5 per cent in the same period. \nAdditional reporting by Mackenzie Weinger Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:28:19.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
