They will replace the airline’s four-engine RJ85, which have hindered CityJet’s profitability, particularly since British Airways put a renewed focus on the east London airport.\nCityJet is the first European airline to order the aircraft, which is built by Superjet International, a joint venture between Russia’s Sukhoi corporation and Italy’s Alenia Aermacchi.\nCityJet executive chairman Pat Byrne said the Sukhoi was a “game changing” aircraft for the company. “We believe our customers will love this jet,” he added.\nThe SSJ 100 seats 98 passengers and is the first aircraft in its class to offer five abreast seating with a 32” seat pitch. It is claimed that the cabin height of more than two metres means the SSJ100 offers more cabin and overhead bin space than competitors.\nCityJet has agreed to take four aircraft in 2016 with the delivery of an additional 11 throughout 2017. The airline has also taken options on an additional 10 aircraft.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BBT_online"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:47:01.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
