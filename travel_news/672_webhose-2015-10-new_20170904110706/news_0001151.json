All 60 of these are expected to fitted by autumn 2016.\nJetBlue uses Ka-band satellite technology to provide broadband internet capable of streaming videos and using multiple devices at the same time. Wifi speeds of up to 20 mbps per device are promised. However, coverage is only guaranteed over the US.\nJamie Perry, JetBlue's vice president of brand and product development, said: \"Soon every JetBlue customer will step onboard knowing their aircraft is equipped with free, fast internet and entertainment.\"\nJetBlue is also preparing to launch unlimited, on-demand entertainment via on-board Amazon Video. This will allow Amazon Prime members instant streaming access movies and TV episodes in-flight, at no additional cost.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:48:57.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
