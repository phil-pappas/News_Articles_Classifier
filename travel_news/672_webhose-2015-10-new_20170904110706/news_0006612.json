Not all things can be covered - that bad haircut or tattoo you could later regret - but a good insurance policy should cover you for most of the normal glitches. As someone famous once said, \"Time spent in reconnaissance is seldom wasted.\" \nRESEARCH, RESEARCH,RESEARCH \nRecommendations from friends aside, make sure you know what to expect from your destination. Travelling outside peak times may be easier on the budget, but experiencing cyclone season or travelling into potential conflict zones or being unaware of social etiquette in unfamiliar areas can land you in trouble. There are enough websites and travel guides nowadays for this to be unnecessary. \nBOOK AND PAY AHEAD OF TIME WHERE POSSIBLE \nPrepaying for accommodation and tours locks you in to a particular time and place giving you certainty and helps budgeting. Many attractions are more expensive on site, so paying up front does save dollars. Also, a well-planned itinerary saves you time and allows for flexibility. \nKEEP CALM \nWhile our first reaction may be torage at airline stewards, hotel staff or tour operators, a calm approach could turn a disaster into something bearable. If the problem you're facing is unavoidable, a considered approach can win friends and get you upgrades. Generosity of spirit in the face of adversity may not win any Nobel peace prizes, but when you're accommodating and understanding you keep your blood pressure down and win admiration. \nPACK FOR EMERGENCIES \nBe a pessimist and pack a carry on bag for the worst case scenario. \nLong gone are the days where two suitcases packed with an outfit for every occasion was the norm. Bags often go astray and occasionally they never return. Make your carry-on luggage count. Pack an emergency change of clothes, plus toiletries in your carry-on. If you are unfortunate enough to lose your luggage, at least you won't have to wear the same set of undies. \nCARRY EMERGENCY FUNDS \nNot long ago a couple of volcanoes blew their tops, disrupting the travel plans of thousands of people. Make sure your travel budget has enough backup to cover extra accommodation and living expenses. Whatever you don't use can always go into the kitty for your next trip, but if you're caught out, you could end up in worse debt than you planned. \nLEAVE HOME SAFE AND SECURE \nThere is nothing like returning home to a disaster. The power went off and your freezer smells like the inside of last month's kitty litter. Or worse, you've been burgled. Tell neighbours and friends what your plans are and get someone to collect the mail, take in the rubbish bins and give the place a lived-in look. Getting a house-sitter may be an option, but if not, a few simple precautions will avoid any home disasters. - AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:27:09.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
