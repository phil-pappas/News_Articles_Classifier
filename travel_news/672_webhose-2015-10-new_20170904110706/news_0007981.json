Gaining global critical acclaim as \"a monumental achievement\" that is \"nothing short of breathtaking,\" ROGER WATERS THE WALL is the brand new feature film written and directed by Roger Waters and Sean Evans . The film unfolds on many levels - an immersive and undeniably epic concert experience of the classic Pink Floyd album, a road movie of Waters' reckoning with the past and an anti-war protest film, highlighting the human cost of conflict. The film received a 'one night only' global cinema release in September, where hundreds of thousands of fans worldwide witnessed the impact of The Wall in a special cinematic event. Now, for the first time, the release will be available on DVD, 2-disc Blu-ray, and Digital HD starting December 1, 2015 and is a must-own release for 2015. Roger Waters said, \" I 'm glad that we have an opportunity to share the film with people on a wider scale. It has had a deep effect on my life; and I'm not the only one. This release provides an opportunity to remember all of our fallen loved ones.\" ROGER WATERS THE WALL was shot during 'The Wall Live' sold out 2010-13 world tour. Seen by over 4 million fans at 219 shows over a period of three years, the show was the highest grossing tour by any solo artist in history. The film, shot in 4K and mixed in Dolby Atmos, features never-before-seen concert footage from this breathtaking tour and includes the hits 'Another Brick in the Wall Part 2', 'Comfortably Numb' and 'Run Like Hell.' Beyond the music, the film follows Roger Waters as he embarks on a deeply personal pilgrimage and reflects on the impact of war with his own family. Woven throughout the film, Waters travels to France to the site where his grandfather is buried, and Italy to a memorial for his father - both lost to war. The journey offers a revealing, candid portrait of a man who is passionately and unapologetically anti-war. The DVD release features bonus footage of Roger Waters visiting the grave of poet and soldier, Frank Thompson , who lost his life during the Second World War. The 2-disc Blu-ray and Digital HD features over 95 minutes of bonus footage from the unforgettable moment when Roger Waters was joined on stage by David Gilmour and Nick Mason at London's O2 Arena in a performance of 'Comfortably Numb' during 'The Wall Live' tour, as well as driving outtakes from the road movie.
