It wasn’t for a huge sum but they and my two grandfathers had put it away over the years for this eventuality: that one of their own would move far from home to a strange and expensive land. I was 21 and unprepared for what the big city was going to throw at me, financially and otherwise. Having that cheque was a good start – it meant I could focus on the more important things: settling in, doing well in my studies and, eventually, getting a job. Money is one of their measures of whether I’m doing OK Six years (and a few pay packets) later, phone calls home still always include a discussion about my bank balance. “How are you doing for money?” asks my Mum. “Can you afford to eat?” says my Grandma. At first these seemed silly, fussy queries, but as I get older I realise that money is one of their measures of whether I’m doing OK. Of how much I might need their support, and of how comfortable I am – a test for my well-being that can be done 200 miles away, over the phone. For them, money is not about status or power. It is a means to show support. Because of them, I can support myself now. One day I’ll be the one giving out the ham sandwiches and a cheque. Christopher Middleton, property journalist and features writer I found a letter from British Telecom the other day at the bottom of my desk drawer. It was at least 10 years old, headed Friends and Family, and listed the names of the people I used to phone most often. And it gave me a shock when I read it. Because I discovered that I am no longer friends with anyone I listed as a friend, but everyone on the list as family, I still telephone regularly. Ask me when I filled in that form who I would still be in touch with in 10 years and I would have said friends. After all, you choose your friends, don’t you? You can never undo the bonds that make you similar Your family – well, they’re just dealt to you, like playing cards. I had always imagined that the people I would stay closest to would be those with whom I had been to school, sat next to at work, or else played in the same cricket and football teams. But not so. For a variety of reasons, they had moved away, we had gradually drifted apart, I couldn’t stand the person they had married – those friends weren’t even on my Christmas card list. And yet, rock solid and immovable in my list of top 10 people, were all the members of my family. Which brought home an uncomfortable truth. That however much you distance yourself from your family, you can never undo the bonds that make you similar, rather than different. Dominic Utton, author of Martin Harbottle’s Appreciation Of Time When I became a father to Eithne, now eight, and Albert, six, one of the things I most looked forward to was being able to teach my children about the world. From the simplest questions (“Why do we need money?”) to the abstract (“What is blue made of?”), I saw fatherhood as a chance to help shape my children’s minds, to instil in them a sense of wonder at all there is to learn and understand. I was also into the idea of them thinking I was really clever. I didn’t expect them to teach me. Relative values: family is a learning experience for all its members Photo: © Image Source, all rights reserved. Naturally there’s all the emotional stuff about unconditional love, sacrifice, the sheer joy that can be had from dancing in the kitchen to ‘‘Nellie the Elephant’’... but lately they’ve been teaching me about more conventional things, too. This summer we visited the remains of a Roman villa in the Cotswolds. “Romans like Julius Caesar?” asked Albert – and then spent 20 minutes explaining the relationship between Julius Caesar, Cleopatra and Marc Antony. He had earnt it in school a few weeks earlier: I had naturally forgotten it. This it is not an unusual occurrence. Eithne regularly tells me about Stonehenge, or photosynthesis, or how glaciers were formed. When we switched broadband providers, our children taught us how to operate our TiVo box. My wife Heidi and I were baffled. If family for me means teaching my children how to become happy, well-rounded, knowledgeable people it seems it’s also about my learning, too. Family truly is a two-way street. Rosie Millard, author and broadcaster How much pocket money do you give your children? When I reached my teens, my father started paying me an “allowance” into a bank account. I well recall the moment when, as a teenager, I asked loudly at the dinner table “What does Refer To The Drawer mean?” I think I knew I was in trouble, but I wasn’t quite prepared for the lecture from my father in my bedroom later on. Nor the sniggering Shakespearean Quote: from my bookish elder brother, namely “Neither a borrower nor a lender be!” My parents came of age in more innocent times, when interest-only mortgages (indeed mortgages of any sort), were things that existed largely on the Monopoly board and certainly were not part of dinner-party conversation. I try to instil my parents' war-time sensibility in my own children Overdrafts? Not if they could help it. Flipping properties that don’t exist? Are you mad? They look at the way I run my finances, which sometimes involves all of the above and roll their eyes. Interestingly, I try to instil something of their war-time sensibility in my own four children. I don’t give them pocket money in cash. I put it into savings accounts. Each of my offspring behaves differently with it. One child is almost always skint. Another spends simply the same amount every month. The third saves it all and has more ready money than her mother. And the fourth saves up for giant Lego box sets (Tower Bridge, and the like), and then spectacularly blows it. I’ll be interested to see what happens if and when they all have mortgages.
