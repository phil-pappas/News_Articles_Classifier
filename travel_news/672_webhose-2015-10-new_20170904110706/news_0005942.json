Consider the Yin and Yang of it all; no trip to China is without its highs and lows. To maintain the highs and keep the lows at a minimum, here is a little advice to help you enjoy your trip to China. mother image/Taxi/Getty Images 1. Getting grossed out \nCome on now, you've heard the saying, \"the Chinese eat every part of the pig but the oink\". Well, there may be a seed of truth to every legend, but consider that with over a billion mouths to feed, waste not is want not. Rather than dashing out of the restaurant squealing \"enough with the entrails\", it's not rude to tell your host that you prefer to eat meat and not the insides, and that you like eating rice and vegetables too.

Not so in China. Don't be surprised if you hear a loud hawk as a bicyclist rides by preparing to expectorate or a healthy satisfied burp from your taxi driver as he nods acknowledgement of your destination. These attributes go part and parcel with the merry and demonstrative Chinese people. You don't have to embrace these quirks, but accept that cultures are different. And difference is good. 3. Being afraid of the Chinese language \nChina is made up of 23 provinces with many dialects and a huge amount of internal migration. While Mandarin Chinese is the common language, many people at home speak a dialect. Therefore, Chinese people are used to being flexible with their language and welcoming to those who try to speak it. A few words go a long way. Even the shopkeeper from whom you are trying to extract a lovely vase at a tenth of the price she asked for it, will smile when you say \" tai gui le \" (too expensive) in Chinese. More » 4. Skipping the street food \nOf course you should take precaution when eating anything you're unused to. But skipping out on street food snacks in China is like missing out on the Great Wall . Food is important to Chinese people, a colloquial greeting goes \"have you eaten yet?\" Most of the time, street stalls make the food fresh and sell out quickly. Don't buy it if it looks like it's been standing out for a while or the stall looks particularly filthy. And look for folks standing in line, this is a good sign.

China is a casual place. You won't need to dress up too much when dining out and you want to be comfortable for the site-seeing and walking you'll be doing. Bring the essentials: comfortable shoes, sun protection, comfortable clothing, your medical kit and toiletries. But leave room for the hoard you will very likely pick up during your stay: chopsticks , silk , porcelain, jade , pearls , embroidery...
