Forecasters warned that the dry, sunny days were over and that plunging temperatures would mark the start of the season in earnest. Much of the UK will experience heavy downpours on Monday and Tuesday with the south west and Scotland seeing nearly half a month's rainfall in just a few hours, prompting concern about flooding. The Met Office said the rest of the country would not escape with showers expected in many areas of the country. There will be some respite on Wednesday, when conditions in the south will improve again but temperatures will remain average for this time of year, following an unusually warm week last week. By Friday, hurricane Joaquin will have reached the UK and could hit the north-west, bringing gale force winds to Scotland. With the weather feeling more autumnal this week, we’ve taken a look at 8 facts about #autumn http://t.co/3wMQLQ9ciM pic.twitter.com/8QZYWiwXsO — Met Office (@metoffice) October 4, 2015 Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: \"There's an initial band of rain that will move through on Monday and generally after that it will be showery with thundery downpours, especially on Tuesday, with persistent rain in the north and north-east. \"There's potential on Tuesday for heavy downpours and heavy thundery showers too. We could see half an inch, 10 to 15mm, an hour in some places. \"There is a possibility we will see some sort of warnings issued for that. \"It's going to be fairly breezy, quite windy. We could see gale force winds in south-west England and west Wales.\" From Monday, temperatures will drop to between 16C and 17C in the south-east and 14C to 15C elsewhere, remaining so for the rest of the week. The hurricane is currently moving over Bermuda with wind-speeds of 115 knots and could hit the north-west of the UK on Friday. Mr Partridge said: \"It's currently in the Bahamas, a fair way off. \"We are not expecting it to come anywhere near the UK until the end of the week, and it looks as though it will stay to the west of the UK and head towards Iceland, so most of the UK will probably not see the effects of it. \"It may well come just close enough to the north-west that we may see strong to locally gale force winds in Scotland from Friday into Saturday.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": ["http://t.co/3wMQLQ9ciM"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T21:01:15.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
