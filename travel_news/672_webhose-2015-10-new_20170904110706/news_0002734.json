The only other year that came close was 2011 when New Zealand hosted the Rugby World Cup. \nPositively Wellington Tourism chief executive David Perks says about 70 per cent of the capital's visitors are domestic travellers. Wellington's visitors are in town on business trips, visiting family or keen to get away for a weekend to check out the culture, food and coffee the city has to offer. Perks describes Wellington as \"the ultimate urban getaway\". Visitors get the best of both worlds with shopping, museums and great dining balanced out by outdoor activities like the zoo , a stroll up Mt Victoria or a visit to Zealandia wildlife sanctuary. The success of Lord of the Rings and Weta Workshop has just added to Wellington's appeal, he says. If you're looking for good food and good fun you can't go too far wrong in the capital. ROSS GIBLIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nYou can't beat Wellington on a good day but even with a bit of wind or rain the capital is full of fun things to do and eat on a weekend getaway. \nTE PAPA HIGHLIGHTS TOUR \nIf you haven't visited the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa before, the highlights tour is a great way to familiarise yourself with the national museum, New Zealand culture, heritage and social issues. \nDon't worry if you're already familiar with Te Papa, the hour-long tour will no doubt include exhibits and information you did not know existed. \nTe Papa tour guide Rangimoana Taylor has a way of bringing New Zealand history to life with his expressive storytelling and personal anecdotes. \nWhile you're at Te Papa, be sure to check out the Gallipoli Scale of our War exhibit with its larger-than-life sculptures of New Zealand at the front in World War I and listen to their stories taken from diary accounts. The exhibit is free and open 10am-6pm. \nZEST FOOD TOUR \nIf you're looking for a taste of the foods New Zealanders hold dearest, then get yourself on a Zest Food Tour . Ad Feedback \nIt's ideal for international visitors looking for an insight into the foods Kiwis and Wellingtonians are most proud of – dairy, coffee and fresh produce. \nThe tour kicks off in central Wellington before heading to the artisan City Market , started six years ago by well-known chef Martin Bosley, then across to the bustling Harbourside Market that offers everything from fresh kale to Egyptian cuisine, an Elvis impersonator to fish sold straight off the boat. \nTourists get to sample custom-made gelato flavours at Graham Joe's award-winning Gelissimo Gelato , a tasting platter full of New Zealand cheese at gourmet supermarket Moore Wilson's and try chocolate made at the Wellington Chocolate Factory . \nIf you're familiar with New Zealand produce, or are a little more adventurous, you could do the loop of the capital's foodie highlights without a guide but if it's your first time in the windy city, or you want the inside scoop on what's hot in the food world, then a Zest Food Tour is a great experience – Just make sure you've got room in your belly for all the samples. \nWALK ALONG THE WATERFRONT \nAfter all that sampling you're bound to feel like a walk to work it off. \nIt's true what they say – you can't beat Wellington on a good day. \nAnd there's no better way to soak in the sights and the sun than with a walk along the waterfront. \nOriental Parade offers a beautiful views of the harbour and a generous number of seats, if you feel like stopping and taking it in. \nIf you've got a bit more energy a hike up Mt Victoria gives a panoramic view of Wellington, sitting 196 metres above the city. \nEXPLORE CUBA ST \nCuba St is the heart of the capital with its shopping, eating and colourful characters. \nThe street has a vibrant shopping culture with both well-known chains and independent retailers. \nA mix of buskers, locals and tourists add to the colourful nature of the street. \nYou can stop and take in the infamous Cuba St bucket fountains or pick one of the numerous cafes or bars to stop in for a bite to eat or drink. \nOn Fridays and Saturdays you can try an array of international food at the Wellington Night Markets. \nThe Friday market has been running for the past three years at the Left Bank on Cuba Mall. \nSaturday's market was launched on lower Cuba St in 2014 following the success of the Friday night market and is full of good food and entertainment, even on a rainy night. \nWHERE TO LUNCH OR BRUNCH \nPossibly one of the best and worst things about Wellington is deciding where to eat – it's great to have so many delicious and unique places at your fingertips but it's often hard to choose. \nSet on Cuba St, Loretta is the little sister restaurant of the much-loved Floriditas. \nA casual but smart eatery with plenty of room (a big plus in a city known for \"intimate\" eateries). \nThe new cafe has already earned a rave review in Australian Vogue . \nLoretta showcases an inventive, seasonal menu, alongside its selection of woodfired pizzas – the artichoke and rosemary pizza is a winner if you're having trouble choosing. \nAt the other end of the spectrum, Mt Vic's Five Boroughs restaurant and bar offers an array of guilty pleasures, including a salted caramel milkshake and a buttermilk chicken burger to die for. \nThe New York-style eatery serves hearty meals in a cool but unassuming spot just around the corner from Wellington's Embassy Theatre. \nA definite must-visit for anyone looking for a healthy portion of comfort food. \nDINNER SPOTS \nCharley Noble is a popular spot for local businessmen and women looking for a drink after work or a classy meal. \nThe eatery sits in the heritage-listed Huddart Parker building on Post Office Square and conveniently just across the road from Queens Wharf, making it an ideal spot for dinner before a show at the TSB Bank Arena. \nCharley Noble was named after a galley chimney, a nod to the building's shipping history. \nThis restaurant has something for everyone, from fresh oysters to ravioli (a favourite) back to melt-in-your-mouth lamb shoulder. \nDessert should not be overlooked by anyone with even a hint of a sweet tooth. If you're not sure, go with the caramel panna cotta. \nSet at the opposite end of town, tucked away off Cuba St in a brightly painted villa, is the fun and justifiably crowded Havana Bar . \nThe menu includes all the must-have traditional tapas, with a twist. Think smoked salmon with vodka creme fraiche or delectable duck. \nWhile the food is amazing, the highlight has to be the attentive staff who move through the jam-packed restaurant and bar with ease, taking the hustle and bustle in their stride. \nIt's likely to be packed and you have to stay on the premises while waiting for a table but it's worth it and the bar staff are quite happy to fix you a drink while you wait. \nCAFFEINE FIX \nIt can be a touchy subject – who serves the best coffee in Wellington? \nYou probably don't want to get into that argument, but luckily there are a lot of places that serve great coffee. \nThe Hangar on the corner of Willis St and Dixon St houses the roastery and cafe of Flight Coffee. \nYou can't go wrong with a cuppa from the Hangar and like all good coffee headquarters, you can buy Flight Coffee's different blends to take home. \nJoe's Garage is often bursting with people looking to sit down for a feed and a flat white. Again the great vibe and attention to good coffee makes it a winner in a capital full of coffee lovers. \nIf you're the type of person who needs multiple caffeine fixes a day, Memphis Belle and Cafe L'affare are also famous for their great coffee and skilled baristas. \nWHERE TO STAY \nQuality Hotel offers everything you need for a weekend stay in the capital, with friendly staff and a perfect location on the central Cuba St. \nThe reporter travelled to and stayed in Wellington courtesy of Positively Wellington Tourism. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:25:34.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
