One of the highlights of a fall vacation is that those who plan a trip to the Cabo San Lucas area will get to enjoy a place home to many beautiful beaches, as well as both exotic and delicious authentic Mexican or other varieties of fusion cuisine, and of course plenty of fun adventurous activities to do. There are many different reasons why travelers are so drawn to the area, but one of them has to be that there is so much excitement going on all of the time. In fact, one of the year’s biggest events is coming up soon, drawing fans of the sport in droves.\nFor all those who don’t know, the fall fishing season is one of the most popular times for travelers to visit Cabo San Lucas, and GlobeQuest Travel Club shares that many people hope to visit during the fall months in order to participate in this competitive sport. A lot of people plan a trip during the season because of the legendary tournaments going on in the area, including the world famous Bisbee Black and Blue Tournament.\nAnglers from around the world compete for the largest black or blue marlin, and many participants of the past have astonished spectators. Past winners have included marlins weighing in at over 330 pounds, a sight that every traveler will want to see. GlobeQuest Travel Club shares that all those who do decide to compete have a lot at stake, especially since this competition has a huge pay day in the end. The contest’s slogan isn’t, “Come for fun and leave a millionaire,” for no reason.\nAlthough it does cost a pretty penny to enter, it might just be the perfect time for travelers to take a chance at coming to Cabo as a normal visitor and leaving a champion. For those who just want to watch, the entertainment the competition provides will still be a fun family activity to enjoy on the famous Los Cabos Marina. Visitors can walk along the marina and enjoy lunch or a cold drink at one of the many restaurants and bars and wait for the fish at the weigh scales.\nThe GlobeQuest Travel Club was designed for the modern traveler and provides a wide variety of luxurious vacation destinations along with several world-class leisure benefits. With the GlobeQuest memberships, unforgettable vacation experiences can be planned over the phone with a live Vacation Expert or just the click of a button on the member-only GlobeQuest website.
