For example, our Utah National Park Ultimate Adventure explores five national parks in the state, including Arches, Bryce Canyon , Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion.\"\nNew trips include:\nArizona Ultimate Adventure – Grand Canyon & Beyond \nArizona's defining geologic feature is surely its breathtaking canyons of every shape and size. This landscape is the backdrop of an eight-day hiking and kayaking adventure that begins with two days in the Grand Canyon . Explorers kayak the emerald-colored waters of Lake Powell and explore Antelope Canyon, a magnificent sandstone slot canyon. The itinerary visits the towering monoliths of Monument Valley and wraps up in mysterious Canyon de Chelly National Monument where a local Navajo guide enlightens guests on the history of the canyon and cultures that thrived here over the centuries.\nGreat Smoky Mountains Adventure \nThe Smokies have the distinction of being America's most visited park and a UNESCO World Heritage site. By day, visitors explore the old growth forest along the classic Appalachian Trail and picturesque viewpoints that many hikers dream about. By night, the forest comes alive during hikes to experience fireflies, bioluminescent foxfire and owls. After three days of hiking, the group's final adrenaline-pumping day includes zip-lining between mountain tops, followed by whitewater rafting down the Nantahala River. A Great Smoky Mountains Family Adventure is also available.\nRocky Mountain National Park Adventure \nOver six days, guests have an immersive experience through this park well-known for its alpine lakes carved into rugged mountain peaks. They hike along meadows and tranquil lakes contrasted by massive rock formations formed by glaciers. Mid-way through the trip, the group sets off on a whitewater adventure on the Cache la Poudre, Colorado's only designated \"Wild and Scenic River\" for an exhilarating change of pace. A scenic drive follows on Trail Ridge Road, the highest paved road in the America, and a hike that crosses the Continental Divide Trail. A family itinerary of this adventure is available, including young guests taking part in the Junior Ranger program.\nUtah National Parks Ultimate Adventure \nREI's Utah trip is a comprehensive itinerary through five of Utah's national parks: Arches, Bryce Canyon , Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion.
