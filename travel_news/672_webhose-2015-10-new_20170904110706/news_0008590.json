It's no wonder the city was listed in the top 10 for public transit and bike friendliness by WIRED and Bicycling Magazine, respectively.\n\"Esurance is responding to consumer demand for alternative insurance options for those who drive less, opting to walk, bike, or take public transportation instead,\" said Eric Madia , auto products vice president at Esurance. \"With Esurance Pay Per Mile, our customers will pay largely based on how many miles they drive, whether that's 1,000 or 10,000 miles per year.\"\nAs the insurance provider for the modern world, Esurance helps customers make smart insurance choices, and delivers personalized product and service options (like Esurance Pay Per Mile) that fit their lifestyles. Esurance Pay Per Mile is an ideal solution for drivers who have a low annual mileage or flexible commuting options. It offers the same coverage options as an unlimited-mileage policy, but of course, the less you drive, the more you save. If you don't drive at all, you only pay the low monthly base cost. Or, if a road trip is in your future, you can hit the road knowing you'll only be charged a maximum of 150 miles in a day.\nEsurance automatically tracks mileage and GPS location through a small device that easily plugs into a port in the dashboard of your vehicle known as the OBD-II port 1 . When you sign up, you'll receive instructions to log into your Esurance Pay Per Mile account, which allows you to set alerts and monitor your detailed driving history.\nTo celebrate the launch of Esurance Pay Per Mile and Portland's passion for being green (and biking), Esurance is providing free bike valet at popular events throughout the city from October through December.
