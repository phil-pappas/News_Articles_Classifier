October 26, 2015 \nTRAVEL planning and local discovery app Gogobot has started curating content of events happening in Singapore, updated weekly under a section called “GoGo this week”. \n\nThis is the travel site’s first international market in Asia for curated content and the second international market outside of London and its home base in the US, said its chief marketing officer, Tim Hannan. \n\nHannan said the California-based site is strong in the US, but looks at Asia as an important market because of its rising middle class of travellers as well as growing interest to travel to the region. \n\nHe added: “The Asian market is interesting. It is skewed towards mobile which we had invested heavily in. Our most active users are app users.” \n\nThe site has also seen an expanding base of users from Greater China, Tokyo and Singapore, and the management has plans to add foreign language capabilities in the future, according to Hannan. \n\n“We are also looking at new ways to make the search experience better so users will get more tailored results,” he added. \n\nFounded in 2010, Gogobot engages users (known as tribes in Gogobot) to write reviews and to discover things they can do in their destination of choice based on interests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:30:47.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
