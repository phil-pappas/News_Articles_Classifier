The website is in both English and traditional Chinese and follows a simple 4-block layout: Discover Chengdu, Event Calendar, Things to Do and Traveler Information, making it easy for users to find the information they need.\nThe website arranges three stages for tourists, namely, information searching before the tour, information services during the tour and social network sharing after the tour. Before the trip, tourists can use the site to plan a detailed itinerary for the Chengdu tour. During the trip, visitors can get the most specific touring news via the website app, and after the trip, visitors can share their tour experience via Facebook, Youtube and other social network platforms and also interact with YoYochengdu, the official account of Chengdu tourism on Facebook .\nS ince October 14, the brand new advertising video for Chengdu tourism has been played on the electronic screens both in the New York Times Square and the international departures and arrivals of San Francisco International Airport. The advertising video, themed as \" Chengdu Can do \", displays a number of Chengdu elements and cultural heritages, including Giant Pandas , Chengdu Hot Pot , Dujiangyan Irrigation System, Mount Qingcheng, and the Temple of Marquis .
