Well, when after more than seven years of courtship, one relation becomes official, you can understand the excitement of that . Note: Please be ready to wait for few more months till the trip actually happens; still now January of 2016 is long away, and I am still long long away in Argentina waiting to be back to my motherland. But still I started the prologue, because the plan already started in my mind, actually not now, for that I have to do a time travel of more than four more years back in the treasure island of my memory. Yes, the decision was taken looong ago, to be pr écised, in the month of March, 2011. Reason? My north Sikkim trip, done then. And additionally I shall be going to some unvisited places in West Sikkim also which I started loving due to few wonderful TRs regarding the same in IM. I know that apparently it is not a part of this trip, but that trip done in the March 2011 was the reason to decide the place for the honeymoon, and back then I was not a member of Indiamike, so could not post any TR of the same also. Hence please let me add few lines about that trip also. Please let me know if you get bored of the below mention of the memory of my trip to the same place where I am planned to go this time also. It was back in 2012, and I was planning for a trip to celebrate my parents 25th marriage anniversary in March. I was not getting long leave from my office, as at that time I was very newly joined in the project. Luckily few days could have been managed and we planned for a trip to North Sikkim & Chhangu lake(Tsongmo lake). I wanted my girlfriend also to join us along with her family as both our parents knew each other, but as none of them were aware of our relation at that time, she could not convince her parents to make the trip at the same time along with us, and moreover at that time she was also yet to get her job and busy with the preparations of different govt job exams. Hence we could not go together then . It was second week of March and due to snowfall the road to Gurudongmar was closed & at that time we made only two day one night trip to Lachung & Yumthang, but that itself made us spellbound. And because of snow, we could not even make it to Katao/Zero point also. This time also we might face similar situation (if not more rode blockage) as we are planning to go earlier, in the first week of February. But still the snow clad mountains and the roads, the superb greenery of the mountains & the beautiful waterfalls made me fall in love with this wonderful state. After returning from the trip I told one thing to my girlfriend back then- Tor sathe biye ta kobe hobe jani na but honeymoon ta north Sikkim ei hobe, bujhli !  (I am not sure after how long we shall be able to get married, but one thing is for sure, the honeymoon destination will be in north Sikkim). I am a huge fan of greenery & waterfalls both of which are in abundance in Sikkim. And it was really lovely, but still I know that the north Sikkim trip is incomplete without crossing the barren lands after Lachen to do the Gurudongmar trip , which we could not do earlier, this time I am keeping one day for that though I am very uncertain whether I shall be able to make it or not in first week of February. But even if not, I shall surely come back to this lovely place again. So our meet will surely happen someday. I shall share few snaps from that trip also to explain the magnificence that made me awestruck and compelled me to take this decision. I am a mountain lover, and hence the trip had to be done in someplace like this. But the splendid beauty of north Sikkim was unparalleled. Though I must mention that I have not seen Kashmir yet, but this was even better than the beautiful mountains of Andes And those places in Latin America are often called as the South American counterpart of the Swiss Alps! And I like this place more as it is nearest from my state West Bengal, though lot of people underrates it! Before the current trip of my honeymoon itself I would like to post few snapshot of my earlier trip so that the pictures can do the talking on my behalf. Some might say that the trip might be less relaxing, but I know the beauty will compensate the journey. And for the last seven years we are already spending relaxing & lazy moments, hence this time let it be like this, I guess both of us would like it, after all going to my dreamland along with my dream girl should be really awesome. Isnt it? And prior to the beginning of our journey to Sikkim, we would be spending one night in Kolakham. The two reasons for this might sound really crazy. Being a Bengali, I wanted to spend at least one day of our honeymoon trip in one of the beautiful hamlets in the lap of Himalaya in our own state. And additionally almost ten years back, in a short trip to the beautiful north Bengal I first befriended one of the co-travellers in our group who was the only person of my age in the group. Later the mere co-traveller of the trip turned into my best friend, and after couple of years even more than best friend. And now , she is the co-traveller of the journey of my life. Yes, my better half, I met her there. And moreover both of us made a trip to these mountains of Bengal together earlier also, when we were infants, along with our parents who knew each other! I know all these may really seem to be silly & crazy reason, but while two are on honeymoon the heart rules over head right? Let me add some pictures from my mentioned trip to North Sikkim with my parents & my brother four years back, due to which I have decided to make my upcoming honeymoon in this wonderful place-", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:03:52.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
