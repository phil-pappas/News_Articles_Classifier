To celebrate the launch of the new flights, the company, known for its exceptional travel deals, is offering one-way fares as low as $41*.\nWith the launch of the new flights, Allegiant now serves five of the country’s top vacation destinations from Memphis, including Florida and Las Vegas. Combined with recently announced service to Phoenix, by the end of the year, Allegiant will operate over 12 weekly flights to six destinations.\n“We know that Memphis travelers are hungry for more low-cost flight options to the places they want to go,” said Jude Bricker, Allegiant Travel Company senior vice president of planning. “We’re pleased to add nonstop service to Austin and Tampa Bay to our portfolio of destinations from Memphis, and we’re certain Memphis travelers will take advantage of our low fares and great travels deals to these two popular destinations.”\nThe new flights to Austin will operate twice weekly between Memphis International Airport (MEM) and Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS). Flights to Tampa Bay will also operate twice weekly into St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport (PIE). Memphis travelers can take advantage of everyday low fares when they book air, hotel and car reservations together.\n“Allegiant’s decision to quickly add additional air service is a strong validation that Memphis passengers have embraced the Allegiant product,” said Scott Brockman, Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority president and CEO. “Airlines are seeing opportunity here, and we look forward to the possibility of continued growth by Allegiant.”\nAllegiant’s innovative business model has allowed it to grow from one plane and one route to offering access to low-cost flights in over 100 cities nationwide, more than any other domestic low-cost carrier. Allegiant passengers can enjoy unique savings by bundling their air, hotel, car and even activity and attraction reservations together for less.\nSource:- Allegiant Air", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:24:31.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
