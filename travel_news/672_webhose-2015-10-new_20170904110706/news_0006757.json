This is our hellish version. Click on to see what real aviation engineers are coming up with. Hide Caption 1 of 9 9 photos: New Airbus patent – Airbus has offered a chilling glimpse into what the future of air travel might hold with a patent that envisages two rows of seats layered on top of each other . The patent states that the design \"still provides a high level of comfort for the passengers\" with seats that could be reclined 180 degrees. Hide Caption 2 of 9 9 photos: Airbus saddle seat – At least with the stacked-rows design passengers will actually be sitting down. Not so much with the so-called saddle seat , another Airbus patent, which would require them to assume a semi-squat position during a flight. Hide Caption 3 of 9 9 photos: Saddle up – The seat (our imagined version shown here), which wouldn't look out of place on a bicycle, has no headrest, with back support also in limited supply. The patent admits that the increase in the number of seats is achieved to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers . Hide Caption 4 of 9 9 photos: Abandoned Ryanair proposal – Fully-standing spaces were proposed by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary a few years ago, although they haven't been rolled out. \"We have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights,\" an airline spokesperson told CNN. If our rendition is even close to accurate, that's a good thing. Hide Caption 5 of 9 9 photos: Economy Class Cabin Hexagon – Those for whom flying means getting lost in a book or a film while politely ignoring their neighbors probably won't enjoy the designs from Zodiac Seats France. Hide Caption 6 of 9 9 photos: Just keep looking down – Zodiac Seat France's Economy Class Cabin Hexagon consists of a tightly packed jigsaw of alternating backward and forward seats, making it difficult to maintain the number one rule of traveling on any form of public transport -- avoiding eye contact. Or so we imagine here. Hide Caption 7 of 9 9 photos: Upright sleep support system – Not to be outdone, Boeing has filed its share of eccentric patents, such as the \"upright sleep support system.\" Its purpose is to help passengers rest during a flight by letting them lean face-forward into a cushion that has a hole to accommodate eyes, nose and mouth. Hide Caption 8 of 9 9 photos: Boeing sleep support – Its purpose is to help passengers rest during a flight by letting them lean face-forward into a cushion. Another cushion supports the chest. Both are deployed from a backpack attached to the seat. Hide Caption 9 of 9 (CNN) You know that blissful feeling when you finally sit back in your airplane seat, giddy with the anticipation of being served delectable dishes on your way to an exotic destination? Us neither. And with airlines under pressure to slash fares and cram in ever more people without extending cabin space, passengers might soon be stacked on top of each other -- literally. Airbus has offered a chilling glimpse into what the future of air travel might hold with a patent that envisages two rows of seats layered on top of each other . The patent states that the design \"still provides a high level of comfort for the passengers\" and seats could be reclined 180 degrees. Read More \"There are myriad concerns when looking at this design, chiefly whether or not passengers would be able to evacuate in 90 seconds,\" says Mary Kirby, editor of Runway Girl Network aviation news website. The time frame is a regulatory requirement set out by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Kirby adds that the concept also doesn't take passengers with disability into consideration, or pregnant women who might struggle to climb to the top level. Mid-flight squat But at least with this design passengers will actually be sitting down. Not so much with the so-called saddle seat , another Airbus patent, which would require them to assume a semi-squat position during a flight. The seat, which wouldn't look out of place on a bicycle, has no headrest, with back support also limited. The designers are under no illusion that this would make for a pleasant traveling experience. The patent states that the increase in the number of seats is achieved to the detriment of the comfort of the passengers , but does offer these words of solace: \"This remains tolerable for the passengers inasmuch as the flight lasts only one or a few hours.\" However, it's still a notch up from the fully standing spaces proposed by Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary a few years ago. The budget airline's CEO took the no-frills concept to another level by suggesting passengers could be transported to their destination strapped in to a standing position for between $6 and $13. Ryanair seems to have abandoned the idea for now. \"We have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights,\" a spokesperson tells CNN. The nightmare of standing flights is likely a long way off. Even so, we can't stop our imaginations. Eye to eye Those for whom flying means getting lost in a book or film while politely ignoring their neighbors probably won't enjoy the designs from Zodiac Seats France. Its Economy Class Cabin Hexagon consists of a tightly packed jigsaw of alternating backward and forward seats, making it difficult to maintain the number one rule of traveling on any form of public transport -- avoiding eye contact. Not to be outdone, Boeing has filed its share of eccentric patents, such as their \"upright sleep support system.\" Its purpose is to help passengers rest during a flight by letting them lean face-forward into a cushion that has a hole to accommodate eyes, nose and mouth. Another cushion supports the chest and both are deployed from a backpack attached to the seat. Passengers may, however, run the risk of looking like they've overindulged in inflight alcohol. All in your head? If the grim reality of air travel is too much to handle, why not escape your surroundings with the help of a sensory helmet ? The Airbus-patented headwear could isolate passengers from sound, sight, smell -- or all three at once -- for a more pleasant and relaxing journey. Presumably this would come in handy if the person in front has lowered the back of their seat and the baby next to you has just had an accident. The science fiction-like helmet would fit in with the company's vision for the airplane of the future, which might look like a donut if Airbus has its way. The patent for its futuristic-shaped aircraft looks like the plane is hoisting the popular pastry on its back, complete with a hole in the middle. According to Airbus, this configuration can fit more passengers and distribute cabin pressure more evenly.
