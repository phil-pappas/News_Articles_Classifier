Upon seeing a post on Facebook about his untimely death, she requested to attend the burial as she had the best memories of Ziwa as a happy and caring person. \nClients from his last group trip were unable to send him off, but sent a generous contribution towards the burial costs. \n“We received condolence messages from [those who worked at] many lodges and hotels who knew him well. All in all, many said they lost not only a colleague but also a dear friend,” said Anna. \nPreviously overlooked by government and tour operators, tour guiding has grown into a professionalized body over the last fifteen years under the current leadership of the President of the Uganda Tourist Association, the apex body for the tourism sector with members drawn from the tour guides association. This is a feat that would have been frowned upon a decade ago. \nZiwa undoubtedly had a lot to do with this, as testimony from several young guides at the burial attested to who said that they perceived him as a role model and always appreciated his advice. In the divine mercy of the Universe, Ziwa died doing what he loved best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:33:26.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
