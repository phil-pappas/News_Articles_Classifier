At the topping out ceremony, Sands China executives in attendance signed the tower's dome before a crane lifted it into its final position. \n\"The Parisian Macao, and in particular its Eiffel Tower, is certain to be a landmark presence on the Cotai Strip, and an iconic addition to the city's skyline,\" said Wilfred Wong, president and chief operating officer designate for Sands China Ltd., who will be working for Sands China beginning Nov. 1, 2015. \"Sands Resorts Cotai Strip Macao is truly like no other integrated resort destinations. Where else but here could you have lunch alongside the serenading gondoliers plying the picturesque canals of Venice, and then have dinner at an authentic French bistro before enjoying some of the most breathtaking views of the Cotai Strip from the Eiffel Tower.\" \nThe Parisian Macao is the latest addition to the integrated resort city of Sands Resorts Cotai Strip Macao. It is part of Sands China's commitment to tourism diversification in Macao, helping support the city's growth as a world centre of tourism and leisure, and one of the region's top destinations for business, leisure and family travellers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:00:10.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
