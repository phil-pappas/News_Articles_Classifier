But Monastero Santa Rosa Hotel&Spa, situated on the famous Amalfi Coast, proves that this idea is much more attractive than most people suppose. Because today, the rooms look nothing like the meager nuns´ chambers.\nFor centuries, the Amalfi Coast has basked in the glory of the rich and famous, like George Clooney and Frank Sinatra. The reason is simple: Italy is very glamorous and elegant here. Monastero Santa Rosa Hotel&Spa lies between the former fishing city Positano, also known as “the pearl of the Amalfi Coast” and the eponymous city of Amalfi and is regally perched on a cliff´s edge. The former convent counts 20 stylish rooms and suites, in which warm colors dominate. Accommodation in a Sea View Superior room starts at 400€ per night, including breakfast. The smell of rosemary, lavender and jasmine as well as the bright blue ocean are the consistent companions during the drive to the five-star-boutique-hotel Monastero Santa Rosa. It is known as the most beautiful hotel at the Amalfi Coast: Elegant interior, lovely decorated accessories, sap green gardens with its blooming bougainvilleas, lemon trees and oleanders, a spectacular infinity-pool and the most exquisite cuisine. Here, guests feel like on cloud nine, although the majestic location plays a prominent role.\nThe herbs, which are growing in the still active Monastero Santa Rosa, give each room at the hotel its name. Guests can relax in the four levels of gardens, while enjoying the stunning view. Typical for Italy, culinary at Monastero Santa Rosa Hotel&Spa plays a major role. At Ristorante Santa Rosa, with its original vaulted ceiling, the awarded chef Christoph Bob has created an innovative Mediterranean gastronomic experience for the most discerning palate with the freshest ingredients from the surrounding Campania region. The Sunset Terrace is located on the hotel´s highest level, where guests can enjoy breakfast, the afternoon tea or complete the day with a cocktail.\nMonastero Santa Rosa Hotel&Spa also hosts a fully equipped spa to rival any major city spa, offering not just treatment rooms, but large-scale amenities that include a sauna, steam, mosaic-tiled experience shower, hydro pool and a tepidarium.\nSource:-Santa Rosa Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:41:28.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
