This is another example of the NSW Government supporting major events to grow regional visitor economies around the State.”\nThe event will be held at the Narromine Aerodrome from 1 – 12 December, and represents the first time the competition has been held outside Europe since it was first contested in 1999. The competition involves various time trials over set courses with pilots tracked via GPS.\nDeputy Premier and Member for Dubbo Troy Grant said the event, with a world-wide following, would give Narromine valuable exposure and provide a boost to local businesses.\n“The conditions and facilities for aviation at Narromine are regarded among the best in the world, and it has become a great way to attract visitors to the area,” Mr Grant said.\n“I am delighted the NSW Government will be working with the Narromine Shire Council and the Gliding Federation of Australia to deliver a great event for Western NSW this summer.”\nSource:- Destination NSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:13:00.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
