The ships will be built by the renowned Meyer Werft shipyard – a recognised leader in cruise ship construction.\nThe new ship will be for fewer than 1,000 passengers and so will retain the intimacy and personal touch for which Saga is renowned, but with some new features including balconies for all cabins.\nLance Batchelor, chief executive officer, Saga plc who announced the decision at the company’s half-year results said:\n“The cruise operation remains at the heart of the Saga brand and demonstrates our commitment to deliver excellence in customer service and outstanding value. This investment will be transformational for the cruise business and for our cruise customers. The precise details of the new purpose built ship will be finalised over the coming months but will retain the traditional features our customers cherish.”\nRobin Shaw, chief executive, Saga Cruises, said:\n“Our plan for the first of our new modern and elegant cruise liners is sure to delight our existing passengers and we hope it will entice new passengers to cruise with us. We will retain an intimate small-ship feel, for fewer than 1,000 passengers, a high crew to customer ratio, great public spaces and entertainment facilities and dining can be accommodated in a single sitting.\nThe artist impressions have been well received and we will continue to consult with our loyal cruise customers throughout the design and build to ensure they get ships that they have helped to make their own.\nAbove all the new ships will continue to provide the quality and excellent service for which Saga is renowned.”\nBernard Meyer, managing partner of Meyer Werft said: “We are happy and honoured to work with Saga Cruises in bringing their first purpose built new ship to life.”\nPlans for the ship will be refined over the coming months but we anticipate her to have some 540 suites and cabins each with a balcony. Around 15% of cabins will be designed for single occupancy and the maximum capacity for the ship will be fewer than 1,000 passengers. There will be single sitting dining throughout a range of restaurants as well as a variety of bars, speciality restaurants and al-fresco dining options. There will also be outdoor and indoor swimming pools, a spa, saunas, treatment rooms and beauty salon.\nThe 55,900 GT vessel will be approx. 234 metres long, 30.8 metres wide and with a planned completion date of summer 2019.\nResearch commissioned by Saga into the UK’s over 50s spending on travel and tourism, found that spending on cruising is expected to increase by 43% to £2.2 billion by 2020. This compares £1.65 billion in 2014 out of a total over 50s spend of £41 billion on travel and tourism. Nearly a third (32%) of over 50s in work said they were planning to increase their spending on cruises after retirement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:20:29.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
