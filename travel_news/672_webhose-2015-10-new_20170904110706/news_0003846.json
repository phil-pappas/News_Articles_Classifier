Cohda Wireless is a world leader in V2X technology, which enables connected vehicles to interact with other vehicles (V2V) or with roadside infrastructure (V2I). Cohda Wireless will launch its V2X-Radar at the ITS World Congress in Bordeaux, France , which runs from October 5-9 . Cohda's V2X-Radar is a game-changing product that will deliver value for drivers of V2X-equipped vehicles, particularly in the early days when the penetration rate of V2X connected vehicles is low. Cohda's V2X-Radar delivers a ground breaking 360-degree sensor that can detect buildings, road signs and also older vehicles that are not equipped with V2X technology. Unlike any current technologies, it is unaffected by rain, snow or fog, and can \"see\" around corners. In combination with a 3D map, V2X-Radar provides highly accurate positioning even in urban canyons. It can instantly detect vehicle speeds via Doppler measurements and obtain 360-degree sensing from a single antenna. As such, V2X-Radar is an important new sensor for autonomous vehicles. Cohda Wireless CEO Dr. Paul Gray said V2X-Radar solved the 'chicken-or-egg problem' of delivering value for drivers in the early days when V2X deployment rates are still low. \"The challenge of deploying V2X is realizing clear benefits for early adopters,\" he said. \"Cohda Wireless, a V2X pioneer, developed V2X-Radar to solve this issue for the V2X business case. V2X-Radar uses standard V2X radio signals to sense the surrounding environment, transforming a standard V2X communications system into a 360-degree car radar.\"V2X-Radar takes advantage of current V2X systems that use IEEE 802.11 compliant wireless signals to share sensor information between vehicles and infrastructure. These radio signals bounce off many objects - walls, road signs and other vehicles - as they travel from transmitter to receiver. V2X-Radar can use these radio waves to identify objects within that environment, including non-V2X equipped vehicles. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T15:52:11.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
