Hotel bookings can also be entered into the mobile device calendar. \n\nTodd Arthur, managing director of HRS Singapore, said: “Mobile channels are a great help, especially on business trips, because last-minute changes to the schedule often call for new travel planning to take place. \n\n“With the HRS Corporate App featuring pre-stored information and specific corporate rates of importance for the business traveller, we make mobile bookings a lot easier for our customers.” \n\nThe app is available for iOS and Android smartphone devices. After downloading “Hotel Search HRS” in the respective app stores, travellers can send a link to their smartphone via the company-specific corporate booking portal to confirm the imported corporate settings. \n\nRead more reports from the ground in our IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific 2015 Show Dailies .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:47:01.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
