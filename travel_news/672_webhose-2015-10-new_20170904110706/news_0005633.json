Although \"standard\" Japanese is spoken here, there are also a number of dialects that are foreign even to native Japanese. The capital of Okinawa is Naha, the island prefecture's capital and largest city. Its metropolitan area covers most of the southern portion of the main Okinawa Island, Naha (population 321,000) has been a port of entry for travelers and goods since the 15th century. Other popular Okinawa holiday islands include Ishigaki, Taketomi, Irimote and Yonaguni. When Okinawa hits the news media it is mainly around a U.S. military presence on the island, that includes some 8,000 marines, most based on the main island. When to visit Okinawa Weather-wise, the best time to visit is July through the end of September. At the tail end of that period, travelers run the risk of getting caught in the dreaded, holiday-wrecking typhoon season. October and November, and February through April, are also popular times to visit, though cooler than in peak months. We're still talking 20 degrees Celsius, a far cry from the chilly temps found in northern Japan. Times to probably avoid include the rainy season, which runs May through June, and the holiday of Golden Week, the first week of May, when crowds of Japanese tourists throng the islands and make getting reservations a nightmare. Getting there is becoming easier with ANA and JAL running multiple flights a day from most of Japan's major cities to Naha -- the three-hour flight from Tokyo makes it a popular getaway from the big city. It's even closer to Hong Kong and Taiwan; Hong Kong-based Dragonair operates four flights a week. Naha offers connecting flights to other islands in the archipelago.

Japan's southernmost prefecture has its own unique cuisine, the result of both its location and complex history.
