The massive gray and pink castle links many architectural styles, dating back to the 13th century and to Slavic rulers. It passed into Austrian and then Prussian hands and was known as Schloss Furstenstein, while repeatedly being expanded, the last time in the early 20th century. It was private property of the aristocratic Hochberg family since the early 16th century, until the Nazis seized it in order to punish the Hochbergs who did not support Hitler.
