Although they're not everything that consumers might want, they're a good start toward solving today's top consumer abuses. Specifically, the Committee recommends:\nAirlines, rather than government, should set rules for use of mobile phones and other communications devices on airplanes, subject only to any safety problems that might arise. This is a no-brainer, and evidence suggests that safety is really not a problem.\nDOT should ensure fair and equitable airport gate and slot allocation to maximize competition and prevent legacy airlines from monopolizing use of airport capacity. This is another no-brainer; no airline should be able to \"hog\" airport and access capacity.\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) should conduct \"realistic\" tests to ensure that in current aircraft, with their tight economy class seating, passengers can still evacuate the plane in 90 seconds or less in the event of a survivable emergency. This is a tough one. A truly \"realistic\" test would include the panic factor that would obviously be present in an emergency evacuation from a burning plane, but I have no idea how to test the panic effect without serious risk to test participants. I am, however, pretty sure that today's tight seating poses a potential safety risk, as well as a comfort disaster.\nDOT should urge airlines to disclose seat dimensions on their websites. This is an odd one: Most airlines already post online seating information, although you sometimes have to dig for it. And the recommendation did not stress that the currently used measure of seat width -- space between armrests or seat cushion width -- is misleading. The correct measure should reflect the critical factor of shoulder-level space, which is essentially the same as the distance between armrest centers. Let's hope that DOT addresses this problem if and when it acts.\nDOT should urge airlines to provide reasonable notice of major changes in frequent flyer programs in a transparent manner. This recommendation is on the right track, but falls short of what frequent flyers need. Disclosure is an insufficient remedy: Program members should own their miles, not the airlines, and airlines should be required to allocate reasonable numbers of seats to award travel in the same way that they are required to offer reasonable numbers of seats at any promotional fare.\nDOT should require that change/cancellation fees be adequately disclosed during the buying process. Again, disclosure is an insufficient remedy: Change fees on most lines are at unreasonably high \"gouge\" levels, and if airlines don't voluntarily reduce them to more reasonable levels, DOT should clamp a lid on these fees.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) should require that hotels include any mandatory hotel fees in the advertised base room rate, not treated as add-on fees. Another no-brainer: If a fee is mandatory, it's part of the price. The Committee does not suggest that DOT enforce this requirement on airline air/hotel packages, as I formally requested in March, 2013, but the Committee is certainly on the right track. The FTC historically moves so slowly on this kind of matter, however, that the issue might gain more immediate traction by action at the state level. In 1997, the Florida attorney general stopped cruise lines from using a similar scam: They were carving up to 30 percent out of the real rate, posting the remainder as a phony low-ball cabin rate, then adding the carved-out portion back in as mandatory \"port charges.\" Individual states clearly have the authority to ban such a practice, which is \"inherently deceptive\" in the words of the Florida attorney general.\nThe Committee, which includes airline and DOT representatives, probably went as far as it could on consumer recommendations. Fortunately, the Committee chairman, Travelers United's Charlie Leocha, and other consumer advocates are not bound by such a limitation, and we're continuing to press these issues. I'll be covering developments, and I urge you to check out all the other projects TravelersUnited.org is pursuing on your behalf.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins@mind.net .
