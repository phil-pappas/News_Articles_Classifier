Make sure to save some time to enjoy the city’s green spaces! \nIf you're in Prague for a few days, seeing the sights and wandering along the cobbled streets, you'll probably tire yourself out quite quickly. This is a gorgeous city with plenty of amazing things on offer, but once your Prague airport transfers have dropped you to your accommodation, you may find yourself doing a lot of walking. Fortunately, Prague also has a host of serene green spaces on offer, where you can rest your weary feet and calm your mind. For some welcome time out, pack a book and some food, and seek out one of the many parks within the city for a relaxing experience to re-energize.Riegrovy Sady, a.k.a. ‘Riegrá e’: Beer on TapLocated in the established district of Vinohrady, this park offers an amazing view of Prague. Moreover, it houses the city’s most popular beer garden. Loved by locals, expats, and tourists alike, it offers three different types of beer on tap, wine, cocktails, grilled food, and screens on which to watch sports.It is also very affordably priced, which can lead to some queues on particularly busy nights. The regulars, however, will confirm that the quality of the beer and the lovely location make the wait well worth it.Vyšehrad: An Important Place In HistoryAlthough found in most city-guides to Prague, Vyšehrad is actually a little way away from the city centre; chances are you won’t pass by it on any of the Prague airport transfers routes, and even locals tend to ignore it. This is a real shame, as this park is perfect for a peaceful walk and a lesson in Czech history.Get the tram to VýtoH and walk up the hill, where you will immediately feel the fresh, clear air and a beautiful view will appear before you. Not only can you find various spots from which to look down over Prague, you can also visit the majestic Basilica of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, as well as the gorgeous Vyšehrad cemetery, where numerous famous people from Czech history are buried.Within the park you will also be able to find the oldest surviving building in Prague: the Romanesque rotunda of Saint Martin, an 11th century construction that is impeccably conserved.Kampa: An Island of Peace within the CityYou'll probably be surprised to discover there is an artificial island in Prague, which is an oasis of calm amidst the city’s busy streets. You can find it by walking from Prague Castle, then when you reach the Charles Bridge cross and turn off from the Lesser Town. Continue down a broad street lined with traditional benches (just a few minutes walk from here, through an alleyway, is Lennon’s wall) and you will find yourself in Kampa Island.The park is a wonderful retreat from the humming streets of Prague’s city centre. The perfect spot for a picnic or a romantic walk at sunset, you'll find many locals decompressing from a long day at work or simply enjoying a catch up with friends and family. If you want to make it a full day out, you can include a visit to the Kampa Museum, a museum of modern art. You should also seek out David erný’s gigantic statues of three crawling babies.Making the Most of PragueAfter you've landed in Prague, airport transfers will quickly and affordably get you in to the city to your accommodation. It can be very tempting, when you’re visiting a city as exciting and full of life as Prague, to be constantly on the go, so it's a good idea to keep these green spaces in mind if you find yourself needing a bit of a break before continuing your exploration of the capital.
