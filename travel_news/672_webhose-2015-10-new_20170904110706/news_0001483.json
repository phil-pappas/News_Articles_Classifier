They last played together at under-18 level. I spoke to them last night for feedback on Greig. They said he didn't talk all that much about the rugby, to be honest! And that's probably about right. Greig's been in camp a long time, he's in a pivotal position on the field, he's the goal-kicker, the captain, and it's at times like these, when friends have come en masse, you can kick off your playing boots and just catch up with old mates. Normal life, away from the pressure cooker of Rugby World Cup 2015 . You go down the street and everybody has something to say about the rugby They're a good group of boys. Jed-Forest Rugby Club, Greig's home club, was on a high last week, on the day of the Scotland-South Africa game. With the boys visiting Greig, it set me thinking about the influences on Greig and these other boys at a young age. Father figure Bill Johnstone was a huge influence in the local school. He’s the nephew of the late BBC commentator Bill McLaren, who was known as “the voice of rugby”. Bill Johnstone was a PE teacher who'd identify players and help them out with speed and agility, to go with the physicality. He was there for maybe 30 years. Things have changed a bit now: you get eight weeks of this and eight weeks of that, whereas rugby was the predominant thing in the school back then. On the road: travelling to the game He’s now a commentator, like his uncle, for BBC Radio Scotland but he remains a father figure to so many players who have come through here. He was for Greig at an early age. Bill and I often stand in the high street in Jed and talk about the game and what's happening. Bill recalls that Greig was always very competitive, even when he was tiny. It didn't matter whether he was playing rugby or golf. Bill's right, he was very tenacious – maybe that's why he's got where he's got. You get certain boys that are really skilled, but you also get boys who understand the game. Greig knows the game inside out. He's got a great understanding on the field. He can read the game really well. Sons of toil The Borders have always had a huge skill set and a great feel for the game. We used to have a lot of physical men – builders and farmers – playing the game although that changed maybe 20 or 30 years ago. Match time: all set for the clash against South Africa John Jeffrey was a renowned farmer and player, and he's got the farm outside of Kelso. A lot of Kelso’s boys were farmers when we used to play them. Farmers or engineers. They were big, strong men. Now the players are looking to the gym to build their physiques because we don't have as many physical jobs any more and they’re all at university. The game has totally changed in that sense. The support for rugby around here at the present moment is huge. The kids are actually talking about the rugby more than the football at the present moment. You never normally hear that. The Rugby World Cup has been huge. It's really taken off. You go down the street and everybody has something to say about the rugby . If Scotland win on Saturday [against Samoa], that's us into the quarter-finals and that's our goal. That would be a great thing for us. You do feel sorry for England going out, but sometimes they bring it on themselves. You have a bit of sympathy in a way, but you should have heard the cheers in the pub I was in Dundee when England were getting beaten. I suppose some rivalries never change. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:06:45.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
