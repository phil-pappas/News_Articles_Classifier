(NYSE: CNW), Con-way Truckload and Menlo Logistics, were recently honored as industry leaders in environmental performance and energy efficiency with SmartWay Excellence Awards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nCon-way Truckload received the excellence designation on the strength of its fleet of nearly 3,000 tractors being 100 percent equipped with SmartWay-certified fuel-savings and emissions-reduction technologies, while nearly half of its fleet of 8,000 trailers is aerodynamic, equipped with the SmartWay-certified UT6 Trailer UnderTray System, manufactured by SmartTruck Systems. The company's tractors also have automatic idle shutdown, and both tractor and trailer equipment feature low-rolling-resistance tires to increase miles per gallon and lower carbon emissions.

Currently, 91 percent of Menlo's network miles are with SmartWay-approved carriers. Menlo also brings proven Lean practices for reducing waste and minimizing resource intensity to all operations and has instituted processes to capture and analyze accurate and timely data to measure sustainability programs and identify areas for improvement.\n\"The EPA is pleased to recognize the 2015 SmartWay Excellence Award recipients. I commend Con-way Truckload and Menlo Logistics for their superior environmental performance and leadership in advancing freight sector efficiency,\" said Chris Grundler , director, EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality. \"Their commitment is helping lead the freight industry to a more sustainable future.\"\nThe EPA launched SmartWay in 2004 to help businesses improve the sustainability of their freight supply chains. Today, the program consists of more than 3,000 partners, representing a cross section of the freight supply chain industry. The SmartWay Excellence Awards , started in 2006, honor top carriers for environmental efficiency performance. Shipping and logistics partners are also recognized for efficiency; for their actions to reduce freight emissions through collaboration, advanced technology and operational practices; and for having a robust system for validating and reporting their SmartWay data, communications and public outreach.
