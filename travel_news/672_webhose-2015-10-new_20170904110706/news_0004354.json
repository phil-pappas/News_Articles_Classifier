After he tied her to a post, the cow got strage fridge and made a run for it, uprooting the post and dragging it around the car park, causing £800 worth of damage to the parked car. One driver crashed his car into a bridge in an attempt to avoid hitting a mallard. Luckily, the duck escaped with just a few ruffled feather, while the driver caused £1500 worth of damage to the bridge. Saga's chief executive Roger Ramsden said: “It seems that just about anything can send a road trip into turmoil and the over 50s have to have their wits about them when they’re in the driver’s seat. “We understand that some things are out of our customers control and that they can’t predict when they may face low flying ducks or deers darting across the road.\" telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:19:06.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
