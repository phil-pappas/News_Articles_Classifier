Next thing we know, the girl is thrown off the plane.\" \nThe video starts with the woman telling the flight attendants that they are being mean to her. \n\"I didn't do anything,\" she can be heard saying. \nWhen the woman doesn't want to leave, a female flight attendant tells the woman that they will call security if she does not leave. \nFellow passengers seem shocked at the incident, with some remarking that they will never fly with the airline again. \nAs the woman leaves the plane, passengers begin booing the cabin crew. \n\"You just lost a lot of customers,\" one passenger says. \n\"It was nuts, and that poor woman was so upset. She handled it well, but you could tell it was super embarrassing for her,\" Byrne told KATU . \nAmerican Airlines told KATU that the investigation is being investigated. \nWatch the video below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:23:45.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
