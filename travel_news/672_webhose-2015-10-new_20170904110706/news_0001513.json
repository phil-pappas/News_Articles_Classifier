It will be the second Rosewood property in Cambodia, following Rosewood Phnom Penh opening in 2016, also owned by Vattanac Properties, and marks Rosewood’s ninth hotel management agreement in Asia. \nThe property will be situated in the heart of Siem Reap, within six kilometers of the fabled Angkor Wat temple complex and UNESCO World Heritage site, with the Royal Gardens, National Museum, Floating Village, Phsar Chas market and other cultural attractions close by. Modern Khmer architecture and abundant indigenous materials will be featured in 135 guestrooms at a minimum size of 60 square meters (645 square feet), all with balconies, and 15 standalone villas. All villas will feature individual pools and landscaped terraces and the largest three-bedroom villas will feature 280-square-meter (3,014-square-foot) interiors. Also showcased will be a free-standing Manor Club villa, a tranquil private space with reception and lounge offered exclusively to villa guests. Rosewood Siem Reap will offer five restaurants and bars with outdoor terraces, including a bistro, a poolside bar and restaurant, a destination bar, a library lounge and a specialty restaurant. There will be a 700-square-meter (7,534-square-foot) residential-style Pavilion meeting and event space as well as outdoor function areas. Facilities and recreation will include Rosewood’s signature Sense spa, a fitness center, outdoor lap pool, children’s pool and play area. “We are delighted to anticipate our second property in Cambodia, providing the Rosewood customer a link between the charm of the capital and the culturally rich destination of Siem Reap,” says Sonia Cheng, chief executive officer of Rosewood Hotel Group. “We’re very grateful for the confidence of Vattanac properties to manage two such significant new properties in the country.” “We could think of no more fitting brand than Rosewood Hotels & Resorts to manage this exquisite resort in Siem Reap – its A Sense of Place guiding concept ensures a sensitive and beautiful reflection of this unique destination,” says Sam Ang Vattanac, executive director of Vattanac Properties. “Our collaboration will certainly elevate the concept of ultra-luxury in the Kingdom of Cambodia.” Rosewood Siem Reap will join sister property Rosewood Phnom Penh, opening in 2016. The landmark 175-room Rosewood Phnom Penh will occupy the top 14 floors of the 39-storey Vattanac Capital Tower One, the tallest building in the capital, situated in the heart of the Central Business District.
