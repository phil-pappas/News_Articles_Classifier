That pass comes with free parking and unlimited downloads of park photos. \nIncreases are also occurring at Disney World. \nDisney spokeswoman Suzi Brown told the Los Angeles Times a restricted version of the pass sells for $849 but has two weeks of blackout days, including the Christmas and New Year's holiday seasons, the park's most popular dates. The park says the move is meant to prevent overcrowding. \nPrices of most other annual passes also went up. \nThe anytime-anywhere pass, good any day at parks in Anaheim, California, and Florida, rose 31 percent to $1,439. \nParking went up $1 to $18, but the single-day admission price of $99 remained the same. Meanwhile, multiple news outlets report that Disney has increased prices at Walt Disney World, with the passes including new benefits, such as free parking for annual pass holders. Disney now sells two passes with blackout dates, with the pricier one allowing people to visit more days. \nThe $329 seasonal pass is now gone. Instead there are gold and silver passes, costing $549 and $389, respectively for Florida residents. The platinum plus pass, which has no blackout dates, is now $729 for state residents, and includes admission to four Walt Disney World theme parks, two water parks and other attractions.
