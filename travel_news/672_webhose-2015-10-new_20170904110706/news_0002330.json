Visa requirements define and shape individuals' ability to travel across borders. They also reflect strongly on each country's relationships with others, and will take into account diplomatic relationships between the countries, reciprocal visa arrangements, security risks, and the risks of visa and immigration rules violations.\nHenley & Partners, the global leaders in residence and citizenship planning, has published the annual Visa Restrictions Index for the last decade, and now launches the latest 2015 edition. This year's Index, along with the unique cumulative data from the last ten years, gives an unprecedented and inimitable insight into the development of visa policies over this time.\n2015\nComparing the 2015 Index to the previous year shows many interesting results.\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), for example, has been catapulted into the spotlight as the biggest climber with its dramatic addition of 37 countries and improvement in rank from 55 to 40. It is also the biggest climber over the ten years of the Visa Restrictions Index, and one of only 22 to have moved up in the rankings over the last year. Marco Gantenbein , Managing Partner of Henley & Partners in Dubai , comments, \" Europe , the US and Canada , as the world's economic powerhouses, continue to dominate the top 10 as we anticipated. However, it's the performance of the UAE which needs to be applauded for the implied improvement of its international relations, which is very much reflected in the improved ranking in the Henley & Partners Index\".\nMalta , the EU country which runs the world's most successful citizenship-by-investment program with over EUR 1 billion in capital raised since its launch about 18 months ago, further improved its position and now has the 7 th best passport in the world.\nTwo countries have held their position in the top spot with visa-free access to 173 countries out of a possible 218, Germany and the UK. Finland , Sweden and the US all dropped to 2 nd place. The four worst passports in the world remain Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia and Pakistan .\nThe Last Ten Years: 2006 - 2015\nLooking at movement over the last decade highlights other interesting patterns. European countries are notable for their stability over this time - Belgium , France , Italy , Luxembourg , Spain and Sweden all remain in exactly the same position as 10 years before. The 'Top Tens' are almost identical, with 30 countries in 2015, compared to 26 ten years before. While Liechtenstein dropped, the Czech Republic , Finland , Hungary , Malta , Slovakia and South Korea all made it into the top ten\nTaiwan , Albania , UAE, Bosnia and Serbia all moved up more than 20 places in the Index over the last ten years, while the biggest drops were experienced by Guinea (-35), Liberia (-36), Sierra Leone (-38) and Bolivia (-40).\nThe growing importance of investment migration can be seen in steady growth of those countries offering residence and citizenship-by-investment. Those countries with relevant programs continue to perform strongly and all now feature in the top 40 of the Index. It is encouraging to see Malta enter the top 10 after launching its Malta Individual Investor Programme, which is ranked as the best citizenship-by-investment program in the world in the Global Residence and Citizenship Programs 2015 report. Portugal , whose program earned the title as best residence-by-investment program, is in 4 th position this year; and the leading Caribbean country, Antigua and Barbuda , moved up again this year.\nThe continued development of these countries demonstrates the critical nature of good visa-free access to counties offering investor immigration programs. In turn, this speaks of the importance of due diligence in such programs, since the reputation of a country's passport and its relationship with other countries is only as good as its newest citizens.\nThis decade has also seen the launch of the Investment Migration Council, the worldwide association for investor immigration and citizenship-by-investment, highlighting the increasing understanding and acceptance of this important force in globalisation.\nHenley & Partners' powerful insight and experience continues to lead the industry, supporting both governments to create and manage the top immigration programs in the world, and individuals to improve their lives by achieving alternative residence or citizenship.\nThe global progress in travel freedom looks set to continue for citizens of all countries.\nTo download the Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index 2015 Factsheet, containing the detailed scores and rankings, as well as information about the methodology of the index, please visit henleyglobal.com/hvri\nSee Notes to Editors for a Summary of Results\nFor related images see: henleyglobal.com/press-images\nNotes to Editors\nNotes on the Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index 2015\nSince 2006 the Index has been produced in collaboration with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which maintains the world's largest database of travel information. In compiling the index, the unique global ranking methodology by Henley & Partners is applied to data provided by IATAÂ´s proprietary passport and visa database.\nHeadlines 2015 vs 2014\nUAE was the highest mover, up 15 places and adding 37 to its score. The dramatic climb can be attributed to a new agreement with the EU for visa-free travel to 36 countries including the 26 Schengen area states, which was made public in May this year. As the first Arab country to be granted a European visa waiver, Emirati citizens may travel to a total of 113 countries visa-free, making it the most powerful passport in the MENA region 22 countries moved up in the rankings: Australia , Brazil , Czech Republic , Dominica , Estonia , Grenada , Hungary , Iceland , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , New Zealand , Norway , Samoa , San Marino , Slovakia , Slovenia , St. Lucia , St. Vincent and the Grenadines , Trinidad and Tobago , United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu Only two countries remain in the top spot: Germany and the UK ( Finland , Sweden and the US all dropped to second place) Sierra Leona saw the biggest drop, losing 24 places Guinea and Liberia had the next biggest loss of 21 ranks, then Syria with 16 Afghanistan , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Iraq , Kosovo , Nigeria , Somalia and South Sudan all lost 15 places The four worst passports in the world remain Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia and Pakistan Headlines 2015 vs 2006\nThe biggest climbers were Albania , Bosnia , Serbia, Taiwan and UAE. each moving up more than 20 places The two most prominent countries offering citizenship-by-investment programs in the Caribbean , Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis , both moved up 13 places Nine countries held exactly the same spot in the rankings as 10 years earlier: Belgium , Brazil , France , Italy , Japan , Luxembourg , Malaysia , Spain , Sweden The biggest drops were felt by Guinea (-35), Liberia (-36), Sierra Leone (-38) and Bolivia (-40) The 'Top Ten' are almost identical. 30 countries feature in the top ten ranks in 2015, compared to 26 ten years before Liechtenstein left the top ten, and the Czech Republic , Finland , Hungary , Malta , Slovakia and South Korea all entered it Residence and Citizenship-by-Investment Country Performance\nThose countries who offer the most important residence or citizenship-by-investment programs in the world continue to perform strongly:\n- Portugal is 4 th with visa-free access to 170 countries\n- Malta climbs to 7 th with visa-free access to 167 countries\n- Cyprus is 14 th with visa-free access to 158 countries\n- Antigua and Barbuda is 26 th with visa-free access to 133 countries All other relevant countries with such programs feature in the top 40, among them\n- Austria , Belgium , Canada , Hong Kong , Monaco , Singapore , Switzerland , the UK and the US About Henley & Partners\nHenley & Partners is the global leader in residence and citizenship planning.
