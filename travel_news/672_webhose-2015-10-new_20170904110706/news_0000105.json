The agreement allows Responsible Tourism Tanzania's \"Tree Level\" businesses to be eligible for marketing under the Fair Trade Holiday brand. \nThe signing of the MRA stands testament to the efforts made by Responsible Tourism Tanzania to incorporate mainstream sustainability practices into tourism operations in order to help safeguard the country's rich culture and sensitive biodiversity. \nUnder the terms of the MRA, Fair Trade Tourism’s approved travel trade partners and tour operators can now incorporate \"Tree Level\" tourism products in their product listings, as well as including them in Fair Trade Holidays - holiday packages that represent global best practice in responsible tourism. \nFair Trade Tourism is a leading Southern African non-profit organisation promoting responsible tourism development. It grows awareness about responsible tourism to travellers, assists tourism businesses to operate more sustainably and facilitates a globally recognised certification programme.
