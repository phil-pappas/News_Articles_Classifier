It is fully integrated with cameras from Liteye Systems providing the capability to slew-to-cue the PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) thermal imaging surveillance systems and to automatically initialise the CCTV recording system.\nBlighter's electronic scanning technology with its FMCW Doppler fast scan capability performs well in cluttered airport environments, detecting small and slow moving targets with minimal false alarms. The Blighter radar can also be mounted high up on existing airport infrastructure thereby minimising installation costs and maximising surveillance as the radar can see over obstacles including aircraft and vehicles.\nJorge Alfonso Ramírez, vice president, Omni S.A., said \"We needed a robust, reliable and maintenance free solution that could provide 24-hour surveillance across the airfield and airport perimeter in all weather and light conditions. Blighter exceeded our expectations and outperformed the other suppliers' systems. The benefits of the Blighter PESA e-scan radars are clear - superior performance, ease of installation onto existing infrastructure, intuitive operation, seamless integration with cameras - as well as lower installation costs, lower through life costs and lower false alarm rates.\"\nUsing Blighter's PESA technology, man detection ranges out to 3, 5 or 6.5 miles (5, 8 or 11 km) and ultra-wide elevation beams (up to 20 degrees) can be achieved. This allows the radars to stand-off from the area to be monitored, for example mounted on top of existing airport buildings, giving clear line-of-sight to the airport perimeter, while still maintaining the full integrity of the radar coverage zone. Being able to mount the sensors on the existing airport buildings, allows for ease of connection to readily available sources of power and network connectivity.\nMark Radford , CEO of Blighter Surveillance Systems, said: \"We are delighted to have secured this contract for the two main airports in Paraguay , our first sale in South America . The significant benefits of the Blighter radar are now being recognised by busy international airports such as London Heathrow and others in the United States , Europe and Africa . We plan to build on this success in this region by targeting other airports and infrastructure sites - oil and gas facilities, mines and air bases that would clearly benefit from our advanced protection technology.\"\nBlighter PESA radars are all-in-one integrated units comprising antennas, signal processing, plot extractor, GPS and compass. The radars contain no moving parts and therefore offer dramatic improvements in reliability compared with mechanically-scanned radars. Blighter radars provide modular scanning from 90º to a full 360º configuration in a single radar.\nBlighter Surveillance Systems delivers an integrated multi-sensor package to systems integrators comprising the Blighter radars plus cameras, thermal imagers, trackers and software solutions. Its ITAR-free systems are used worldwide in commercial, government and defence markets in area and asset protection for national border security, homeland security, critical infrastructure protection such as airports, coastal surveillance, and in military applications.\nFor more information about the Blighter perimeter security radar or other products from Blighter Surveillance Systems, please visit http://www.blighter.com , telephone +44(0)1799-533200 or email enquiries@blighter.com .\nBlighter will be demonstrating its airport surveillance solutions on stand 1932 (Hall B4) at Inter Airport Europe 2015, 6-9 October at the Munich Trade Fair, Munich, Germany ; and at Airport Security 2015 (stand 10) at the Renaissance Barcelona Fira Hotel, Barcelona, Spain , 17-18 November.\nHigh resolution photography of Silvio Pettirossi International Airport and the Blighter B400 Series radar with PTZ camera from Liteye Systems can be downloaded from the link below:\nhttp://www.blighter.com/images/images/pr/international-airport-silvio-pettirossi-copyright-felipe-mendez-high-res.jpg\nhttp://www.blighter.com/images/images/pr/blighter-b400-series-radar-with-liteye-aquila-camera-high-res.jpg\nAbout Blighter Surveillance Systems ( http://www.blighter.com )\nBlighter Surveillance Systems is an electronic-scanning radar and sensor solution provider.
