You will be, after taking one of these small-group tours. >> What it does : Connects docents — not guides — with travelers who seek in-depth experiences in historically rich destinations around the world.\n>> What’s hot : Browsing through the website will open your eyes to travel experiences you might not know are available. Walk through Florence, Italy, with a docent who’s written a book about the Duomo, have dim sum with a local food writer in Hong Kong or stroll through the National Portrait Gallery in Washington with an art history professor, to name a few tours. Have deep conversations. Enjoy the attention that a tour with no more than six people can offer. Prices vary, but I found several tours for less than $100 per person. If you’re willing to splurge, go for a full private tour.\n>> What’s not : I was excited to “Meet Context docents,” but when I clicked the link from the home page, I found broken images and place-holder photos. You can also find information about docents on the individual tour pages, but those photos were inconsistent, too.\n———\nJen Leo, Los Angeles Times\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:31:40.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
