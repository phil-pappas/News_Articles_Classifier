Thankfully, pension rules have been dragged into the 21st century and most schemes recognise cohabiting partners alongside spouses and civil partners. What’s more, the changes that came into force in April mean that, when it comes to defined contribution schemes, should you die with a hefty pension pot, it can now be left to anyone you would like – whether you are married or not. Although pensions aren’t counted as someone’s estate for inheritance tax purposes, under previous rules there used to be a hefty 55pc pensions death tax until earlier this year on pensions in drawdown. If you die before 75, there is no tax to pay on your pension In April, this was scrapped as part of the Government’s pensions freedoms. Adrian Walker, pensions development manager at Old Mutual Wealth, says: “If you die before 75, there is no tax to pay on any such payments. If you die after your 75th birthday, any payments will be subject to tax at the beneficiaries’ marginal rate of income tax.” But he adds that not all policies offer the drawdown option, despite it being a beneficial way for holding any legacy capital. “This gives the beneficiary total control of access to funds but outside their estate for inheritance tax purposes and not part of their pension lifetime allowance, which means they can pass on the value to whoever they nominate, or can secure annuity purchase where relevant for their life. The key is to ensure notification of intended beneficiaries is up to date ‘‘These options are not available under a final-salary scheme, but there will be potential pension entitlements available to spouse/civil partner and/or dependent children in the event of the member’s death before and after benefits have been drawn.’’ Mr Walker adds: “For money-purchase arrangements, the key is to ensure notification of intended beneficiaries is up to date so scheme trustees can understand current plans when they use their discretion in terms of applying value.” The new rules do not apply to your state pension, which cannot be passed to someone else. If you have contributed towards an additional state pension, your spouse or civil partner may get some. If your spouse or civil partner is over state pension age when you die, they may be able to increase their basic state pension by using your qualifying years’ entitlement, so long as they don’t already get a full pension.
