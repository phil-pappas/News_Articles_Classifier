The room also has a library of books, audiobooks and films related to space travel, with an automated female voice inspired by John Carpenter's science fiction film \"Dark Star\" welcoming the guests. \n\"They will forget that they are staying in a hotel room -- they will feel like being on board a space station,\" says Najjar. \nWhile in most hotels guests can take a pick of rolling news channels, the Space Suite gets a live stream from the International Space Station and a direct link to NASA TV. \n$2,000 price tag \n\"Space is the final frontier for humankind,\" says Najjar. ''Current developments in space travel and exploration will have a huge impact on our life on earth in the future. One day we will see hotels floating in space. What we did here is a space station floating in a hotel.\" \nWith a price tag of nearly $2,000 a night and an unorthodox concept, who is the Space Suite designed to appeal to? \n\"A guest who is art loving, a collector, a visitor of Art Basel or someone who would like to have an overall art experience,\" says Carsten K. Rath, CEO of Kameha. \nPatrons will also get to spend an hour in an Airbus A320 flight simulator and try body flying, a training technique used by skydivers which sees them suspended in a vertical wind tunnel. \nAnd if they're curious to meet the man behind the design, they'll be given an opportunity to visit Michael Najjar's Berlin studio and see him there. \nKameha Grand Zurich offers the galaxy getaway two-night package from 1845 CHF ($1,890) per night. This includes bed and breakfast accommodation in the space suite, space amenities on arrival, 1.5 hours body flying /1 hour flight simulation in an A320, a signed book of Michael Najjar's work, a designer art gift, and an invitation to meet Najjar in his Berlin studio. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:33:02.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
