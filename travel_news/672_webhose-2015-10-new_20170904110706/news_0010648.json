Held by the Stars of the North WAI (www.starsofthenorth.org) and AirSpace Minnesota, and co-sponsored by Sun Country Airlines, the experience brought 1,000 people to the Downtown St. Paul Airport on Saturday, September 26. The skies over St. Paul were filled with excitement as 213 young people received Young Eagles flights provided by volunteer pilots from EAA Chapters 25, 1518 and 237.\n \nThe free event for girls ages 10-17, titled “Navigate Your World – Pathways in STEM,” showcased the broad spectrum of careers available in aviation and aerospace, education pathways, aircraft displays and role models of all ages. Featured trailblazers included Honeywell engineer Elizabeth Bierman, Northwest Airlines flight attendant and author Anne Billingsley Kerr, aerobatics and airline pilot Julie Clark, aerospace leader and astronaut Dr. Sandy Magnus, WWII pilot Elizabeth “Liz” Strohfus and Barb Wiley, first female pilot for North Central Airlines.\n \nJulie Clark thrilled the crowd by arriving in her beautiful T-34 plane with smoke trailing, and Scott Romuld, who flies with the T-6 Thunder North American Flight Team, brought his plane to show one of the favorite planes flown by Liz Strohfus during WWII.\n \nParticipants received Logbooks that highlighted the career pathways and featured aircraft, with pages for autographs from the featured “Legends.” A new Pathways Poster was unveiled that includes this information and more. The poster will be made available to all Minnesota schools and youth groups to help students, parents and teachers access information about the many exciting opportunities available in fields connected to flight, from healthcare to wearable technologies.\n \nAfter heart-warming, inspirational presentations by the featured speakers, everyone received aviator sunglasses as a symbol that flight helps us see the world differently, and Go Boldly buttons to encourage everyone to find and pursue their dreams with confidence. It was an amazing day of blue skies, big smiles and a chance to imagine what’s possible when dreams and skills connect.\n \nThis experience was made possible by many outstanding volunteers and sponsors, including presenting sponsor UTC Aerospace Systems and category sponsors Academy College, Cirrus Aircraft, SkyWest Airlines, Sun Country Airlines and Thunderbird Aviation.\nSource:- Sun Country Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:09:37.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
