This will be especially problematic over recent burn scar areas, where rampant wildfires have charred millions of acres. \nHowever, it won't all be bad. California is expected to receive much-needed mountain snow, which is necessary to fill reservoirs in the spring. \nAccording to AccuWeather Expert Long-Range Forecaster Paul Pastelok, the 2015-2016 season may yield triple the amount of snow than that which fell last year in the central and northern mountains. \nThis will allow locals to breathe a sigh of relief since April 1 measurements revealed snowpack across the Sierra Nevada was at its lowest level in 500 years. \n\"The current deficit is too large for this winter to end the drought,\" according to Noll. \"But this would certainly put a dent in it.\" \nOn the opposite coast, the Northeast and Southeast will also help bear the brunt of El Niño's effects. \nAbove-average storminess will greet cities such as Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Newport and Raleigh, but the million dollar question remains: In what form will the precipitation fall? \nThe weather pattern threatens to send chilly air masses into the Eastern U.S., which could result in a corridor of snow from Texas up into the spine of the Appalachians. \nHowever, the wild card will be whether the timing of the cold air matches up with the timing of the precipitation. \n\"If so, there could be a few big storms that blow our forecasts out of the water,\" Noll said. \"That's a risk right there.\" \nWhile it's a precarious position for the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, there's a good deal of certainty that the Great Lakes region will get less lake-effect snow than usual. \nClimatologically, some of the driest years on record have occurred during El Niño years, according to Noll. Less lake-effect snow is typical, especially for the upper lakes. \nFarther south, forecasters are concerned El Niño will lead to exceptional storminess. \n\"These big storms that will be barreling across the southern Plains and Southeast often drag fairly impressive cold fronts across the Gulf Coast,\" Noll said. \n\"Once they head into Florida, you can be talking about explosive thunderstorms and very heavy rainfall.\" \nAdditionally, El Niño may prolong the drought across the interior Northwest and promote milder days with less snow across much of the northern tier of the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:57:45.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
