We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:\nBy eliminating fuel expense and certain special items from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long term, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Cost per ASM (CASM) excluding fuel and certain special items is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted income before income tax and CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) are important metrics for the employee incentive plan that covers all Air Group employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as mark-to-market hedging adjustments or special revenues, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. Note B: Air Group has two operating airlines - Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air. Each is a regulated airline with separate management teams primarily in operational roles. To manage the two operating airlines, management views the business in three operating segments. Alaska operates a fleet of passenger jets (Alaska Mainline) and contracts with Horizon, SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest), and Peninsula Airways, Inc. (PenAir) for regional capacity under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue from those flights (Alaska Regional). Horizon operates a fleet of turboprop aircraft and sells all of its capacity to Alaska pursuant to a capacity purchase arrangement (Horizon). The Company believes the amounts paid by Alaska to Horizon approximate current market rates received by other regional carriers for similar flying and are available to pay for various Horizon operating expenses such as crew expenses, maintenance, and aircraft ownership costs. All inter-company revenues and expenses between Alaska and Horizon are eliminated in consolidation.\nGlossary of Terms\nAircraft Utilization - block hours per day; this represents the average number of hours our aircraft are flying\nAircraft Stage Length - represents the average miles flown per aircraft departure\nASMs - available seat miles, or \"capacity\"; represents total seats available across the fleet multiplied by the number of miles flown\nCASM - operating costs per ASM, or \"unit cost\"; represents all operating expenses including fuel and special items\nCASMex - operating costs excluding fuel and special items per ASM; this metric is used to help track progress toward reduction of non-fuel operating costs since fuel is largely out of our control\nDebt-to-capitalization ratio - represents adjusted debt (long-term debt plus the present value of future operating lease payments) divided by total equity plus adjusted debt\nDiluted Earnings per Share - represents earnings per share using fully diluted shares outstanding\nDiluted Shares - represents the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion, such as stock options, were exercised\nEconomic Fuel - best estimate of the cash cost of fuel, net of the impact of our fuel-hedging program\nLoad Factor - RPMs as a percentage of ASMs; represents the number of available seats that were filled with paying passengers\nMainline - represents flying Boeing 737 jets and all associated revenues and costs\nPRASM - passenger revenue per ASM; commonly called \"passenger unit revenue\"\nProductivity - number of revenue passengers per full-time equivalent employee\nRASM - operating revenue per ASMs, or \"unit revenue\"; operating revenue includes all passenger revenue, freight & mail, Mileage Plan, and other ancillary revenue; represents the average total revenue for flying one seat one mile\nRegional - represents capacity purchased by Alaska from Horizon, SkyWest, and PenAir. In this segment, Alaska Regional records actual on-board passenger revenue, less costs such as fuel, distribution costs, and payments made to Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir under the respective capacity purchased arrangement (CPAs). Additionally, Alaska Regional includes an allocation of corporate overhead such as IT, finance, other administrative costs incurred by Alaska and on behalf of Horizon.\nRPMs - revenue passenger miles, or \"traffic\"; represents the number of seats that were filled with paying passengers; one passenger traveling one mile is one RPM\nYield - passenger revenue per RPM; represents the average revenue for flying one passenger one mile\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alaska-air-group-reports-record-third-quarter-2015-results-300164494.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.alaskaair.com/investors", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF35431&Transmission_Id=201510220800PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF35431&DateId=20151022", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alaska-air-group-reports-record-third-quarter-2015-results-300164494.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.alaskaair.com/newsroom"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:33:45.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
