Two years ago the company launched their #magicplane which featured Mickey Mouse. WestJet/Instagram \n\"westjet#Elsa, with her magical snow powers, graces the tail of our newest custom-painted aircraft.\" \n\"This aircraft takes the relationship between WestJet and Disney to a completely new level of cool,\" Bob Cummings, WestJet Executive Vice-President, Commercial said. \n\"Two years ago, we launched the #MagicPlane, our first Disney-themed aircraft, and no matter where it flies throughout our network, it is the most-anticipated and most-photographed aircraft in WestJet history. Today, we are proud to team up with our great friends at Disney to create a sequel like no other.\" \nAccording to World Airline News, the plane was painted by team members from Canada, the US and Germany, who were said to have watched Frozen to \"get them into the spirit\" before work began. \nThe job took 21, 24 hour days to complete. Sparkles were added to the paint in certain sections to allow the aircraft to \"shimmer and shine\" as it moves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:27:23.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
