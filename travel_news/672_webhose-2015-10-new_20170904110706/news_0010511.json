Click HERE to read a bit more about CHAPADA DOS VEADEIROS !!! CORREDEIRAS DO RIO PRETO (3) ! BLACK RIVER RAPIDS (3) ! On September 17th, I took a plane (TAM AIRLINES, using miles) and flew from CAMPINAS/SP to BRASÍLIA/DF, where I spent one entire day. On September 18th, I took a bus (REAL EXPRESSO) and went up north, to the town of ALTO PARAÍSO DE GOIÁS, the gate to CHAPADA DOS VEADEIROS/DEER HUNTERS' MOUNTAIN RANGE, in the northern region of the STATE OF GOIÁS! On September 20th, I spent most of the day visiting two falls and the rapids of RIO PRETO/BLACK RIVER, inside PARQUE NACIONAL DA CHAPADA DOS VEADEIROS/DEER HUNTERS'S MOUNTAIN RANGE NATIONAL PARK! We had to walk for 5km to reach the two Falls (one - the highest - 120m - we could only see it from high, standing on a look-out point, and the other one - the lowest - 80m - we could only see it from down low, staying around a lake, enjoying the cold water, which was good for it was pretty hot, although we were during the changing seasons (winter - spring)! After that, we went back up and headed for the rapids, which was hard, because the 3 o'clock sun was even stronger! As we reached the rapids, how fun, we all jumped into the waters with our clothes on (some even with their shoes on)! Lots of bathing and having our backs, heads and other parts of our bodies massaged by the falling waters! During the rainy season, the rapids are rougher in this place! When I was there, it was still pretty dry and, therefore, one could find those peaceful lake-looking waters!
