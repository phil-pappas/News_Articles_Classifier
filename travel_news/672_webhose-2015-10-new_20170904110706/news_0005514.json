Jeddah, its second largest city, is both a commercial centre as well as the principal gateway for religious pilgrimages to nearby Mecca. With thrice-weekly non-stop services (to Jeddah), Scoot looks forward to improving connectivity between Singapore and this important world city.” \n\nCustomers who have made advance bookings to or from Jeddah on SIA will be re-accommodated on Scoot’s new services, or may otherwise opt for a refund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:03:28.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
