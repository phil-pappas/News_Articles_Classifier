Commenting on these results, airport CEO, Jean-Jacques Cloquet, said he believes that Brussels South Charleroi Airport has plenty of potential: “ After a difficult year in 2014, we saw a significant increase in passenger traffic out of BSCA. This is the result of a major effort on the part of everyone. The 10% increase in September clearly shows that the demand is there and is high. The increase of 9% seen over the first three quarters is sizeable given the context in which we operate. Collaboration with the airlines continues and aircraft capacity utilisation is increasing. It is clear that the efforts made in different areas benefit everyone. 2015 is gradually drawing to a close; the end of a year in which two new destinations will be added to those available from BSCA, namely Copenhagen (Denmark – Ryanair) and Debrecen (Hungary – Wizz Air).” \nSource:- Charleroi Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:35:34.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
