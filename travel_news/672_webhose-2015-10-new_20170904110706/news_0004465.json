This enables vehicle owners to raise their earnings significantly, and also reduces car rental rates by 40 percent. P2P carsharing has become the next step toward more affordable car rentals in the new sharing economy, as it targets vehicles that are idle 92 percent of their lifetime.\nKoolicar, a French P2P CSO, is revolutionizing the P2P carsharing market by introducing the KoolBox, which enables keyless transactions between vehicle owners and renters.\n\"Koolicar has not only reduced the cost of rentals by approximately 40 percent, compared to traditional carsharing models, but also allows members to rent out their cars from one to several hours, even when they are away from their vehicles. Also, Koolicar's strategy to partner with MAIF, one of the most trusted insurance companies, has resulted in high customer confidence and strong community engagement,\" said Frost & Sullivan Research Analyst Krishna Achuthan .\n\"When we launched Koolicar in 2011, we decided to focus on customer experience and invested in technology. We developed the KoolBox in order to eliminate all carsharing constraints. We recently added advanced fleet management functionalities, and through our OpenFleet brand, we can now address not only the P2P carsharing market, but the more global worldwide carsharing and fleet management markets. We are delighted to receive this Award from Frost & Sullivan,\" said Koolicar founder Stephane Savoure .\n\"The cornerstone of Koolicar service has always been to make the user experience easier; this is what makes it unique in the market,\" added Thomas Ollivier , who is in charge of Collaborative Economy and New Practices at MAIF.\nFor its overall success in the French P2P CSO space, Frost & Sullivan is proud to present Koolicar with the 2015 European Growth Excellence Leadership Award.\nEach year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in growth and customer value. It recognizes the superiority of the product/service as well as the overall customer, purchase, ownership and service experience offered, which has resulted in the recipient company seeing above-market growth and increased share of wallet. The award lauds the growth, diversification and sustainability strategies of the company.\nFrost & Sullivan Best Practices Awards recognize companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service, and strategic product development. Industry analysts compare market participants and measure performance through in-depth interviews, analysis, and extensive secondary research to identify best practices in the industry.\nAbout Koolicar\nKoolicar was founded in 2011 by Stephane Savoure .
