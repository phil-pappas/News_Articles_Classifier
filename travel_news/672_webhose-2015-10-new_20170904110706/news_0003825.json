If I’m afraid of something I’m going to figure out a way to deal with it. Since I was a little kid I’ve loved fast, powerful machines but the truth is I find all my hobbies – scuba diving, helicopter flying and motorcycling – nerve-racking. I’m terrified.\nDuring my scuba diving training, the dive master made me sit on the bottom of the bay and take my mask off, then put it back on. I could not do it. The water went rushing up my nose, I thought I was going to drown, I started to bolt up to the surface and he grabbed my ankles to hold me down. It was just an awful experience.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest “If you don’t confront your fear, it wins. ... Patricia Cornwell in the cockpit of her helicopter. Photograph: Patricia Cornwell\nEven now when I dive, I hope the weather gets bad so I don’t have to go. I get into the water and have to settle for a minute because my heart starts racing. But you cannot dive if you get hyped up – you have to calm down. And when you do, you might have the dive trip of your life.\nThe first time I flew a helicopter solo, my knees were knocking together – literally – I had to start singing to myself. Then all of a sudden it was like, “Oh my God, this is the most fun thing I have ever done. I am flying, I’m alone and it’s just me doing this.”\nThe most frightened I have ever been was flying a helicopter. We were north of Florida, and we got caught in weather we weren’t expecting – a volatile storm was moving in. We got trapped in fog, flying at 100-something feet in a wooded area, and couldn’t see. It was raining like a monsoon and I really thought this was going to be it; any minute we were going to hit a powerline and come down. It was terrifying. Just when we thought it was hopeless, all of a sudden this little grass strip opened up under us and we landed.\nI’m a bit of a method actor. I wanted to incorporate all these experiences into my writing, so my readers would feel like they’re in a helicopter flying over the South Florida Keys looking at turtles and sting rays, or diving a shipwreck in the Bermuda triangle. If I didn’t experience those things, I couldn’t describe them – so I had to learn how to do them.\nIf I hadn’t learned to deal with fear, I would have been crippled by it. I grew up with it: there was dysfunction in my home, a lot of instability. I never knew from one day to the next what was going to happen: were we going to be bankrupt? Was my mum going to be depressed and go into hospital? Would we be staying with horrible people in a foster home?\nI wandered the streets of Miami alone, at four or five years old, because there was no one to look after me. I was molested by a local patrolman and ended up going through grand jury proceedings.\nFrom then on, I knew what it was to be so terrified that you almost couldn’t move and I learned that if I didn’t conquer this, I would die. So as I got older, if something scared me I would run right into it. My fight became stronger than my flight, because I had no choice.\nIf you don’t confront your fear, it wins. Which is why I’m a totally different person since I took up my extreme hobbies. It’s made me more confident, bolder, keener to try other things.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In deep ...

But you could do a helicopter tour and enjoy the ride. Scuba diving is more accessible. You can go out on a charter boat with a group of people and down you go.\nIt’s as simple as this: if an opportunity presents itself, don’t walk away from it. If someone says it might be cool to learn to snorkel, or ride a motorcycle, and you light up like a Christmas tree when they say it, don’t argue yourself out of it. Take the next step. And don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something. Everything I do is stuff I was told I couldn’t do.\nMy brothers wouldn’t let me borrow their bikes, so my revenge was to learn how to be a helicopter pilot and own a helicopter. That’s what a girl does when her brothers won’t let her ride their bikes. Women don’t need to apologise because we’re female. If you want to try something adventurous, that doesn’t make you a tomboy. I don’t do all these things just because I’m gay – although that’s what some people have tried to say. That’s just a baloney, sexist comment. I do it because I can – women can.\nMy sports have reawakened a part of me that for a long time I pushed aside – my ability to be scary as a writer. I am constantly exploring the place where life and death meet. As a child, I wrote stories that would scare the neighbourhood kids so badly they would go home crying. I probably could have been a Stephen King in terms of my ability to scare myself silly, and everybody else too.\nA lot of people enjoy fear as pleasure. It’s delicious that you can get so close to the dragon that you can feel its warm breath, but you’re not going to get burned. That’s an empowering experience.\nAll this makes you feel more alive because you are taking power and control over a world that is random and difficult. And the more you do with boldness and confidence, the more you get out of life. That’s what we should do while we’re here. Don’t just exist – do something.\nPatricia Cornwell’s Depraved Heart is published by Harper Fiction on 22 October", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387435677/53bc10c4-3e25-4f2b-970f-7eaca87f5a21-2060x1297.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=44fe6875b7b8c1f65cd678761b8f7bd9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387333706/58924804-088d-4685-9d6f-5a2e858a7b2c-2060x1545.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=4e0f3c9030868d94f359ee4bdba37086", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ck8h%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ck8h&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F9%2F1444387435677%2F53bc10c4-3e25-4f2b-970f-7eaca87f5a21-2060x1297.jpeg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Patricia+Cornwell%3A+how+extreme+sports+changed+my+life&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Flifeandstyle%2F2015%2Foct%2F10%2Fpatricia-cornwell-extreme-sports-fear-scuba-helicopter&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F9%2F1444387435677%2F53bc10c4-3e25-4f2b-970f-7eaca87f5a21-2060x1297.jpeg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Patricia+Cornwell%3A+how+extreme+sports+changed+my+life&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Flifeandstyle%2F2015%2Foct%2F10%2Fpatricia-cornwell-extreme-sports-fear-scuba-helicopter&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F9%2F1444387333706%2F58924804-088d-4685-9d6f-5a2e858a7b2c-2060x1545.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387435677/53bc10c4-3e25-4f2b-970f-7eaca87f5a21-2060x1297.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=3b46e29b07467ac267e9265eaa430cfb", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Patricia%20Cornwell%3A%20how%20extreme%20sports%20changed%20my%20life&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ck8h%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Patricia%20Cornwell%3A%20how%20extreme%20sports%20changed%20my%20life&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ck8h%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ck8h%2Fsfb%23img-3&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4ck8h&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F10%2F9%2F1444387333706%2F58924804-088d-4685-9d6f-5a2e858a7b2c-2060x1545.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387435677/53bc10c4-3e25-4f2b-970f-7eaca87f5a21-2060x1297.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=82fd8156b789cc47bcc701633b6d5f8c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387435677/53bc10c4-3e25-4f2b-970f-7eaca87f5a21-2060x1297.jpeg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=737f8047f5d514a570956905c72b229e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387333706/58924804-088d-4685-9d6f-5a2e858a7b2c-2060x1545.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=ea526d5e00b4f518bd497ad444164222", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387333706/58924804-088d-4685-9d6f-5a2e858a7b2c-2060x1545.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f4fe3cb040a6a2bf107f56d4219edafd", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387333706/58924804-088d-4685-9d6f-5a2e858a7b2c-2060x1545.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=8396f24575c7f609cde35efa13f02db0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/9/1444387435677/53bc10c4-3e25-4f2b-970f-7eaca87f5a21-2060x1297.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0daa102d106edfffb4acaca079708926"], "published": "2015-10-10T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:55:40.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
