The innovative closed-loop system measures temperature on the surface of the glow plug and uses a proprietary algorithm to respond accurately and quickly to dynamic engine conditions. Unlike open-loop systems which require calibration and set-up for each vehicle model powered by an engine, BorgWarner's closed-loop technology requires calibration for the engine only and can operate with any engine control unit (ECU).\nA first-to-market innovation, BorgWarner's electrical heated thermostat with stroke sensor helps automakers accurately monitor thermostat functions to fulfill new emissions regulations. BorgWarner engineers utilized an innovative combination of wax elements and magnetic field sensors, allowing the ECU to directly and continuously detect thermostat stroke without running the coolant pump. The patented, corrosion-resistant technology maintains the same small package size and interface as a standard thermostat, reduces parasitic losses and increases fuel economy while improving engine performance and protecting the engine from overheating. \"At BorgWarner, we don't just talk about innovation-it's what we do. Since 2005, 20 BorgWarner innovations have been named finalists in the annual PACE Awards. In addition, each of our finalists in this year's competition has earned multiple patents,\" said James R. Verrier , President and Chief Executive Officer, BorgWarner. \"We are driven to transform today's challenges into tomorrow's solutions and proud to be honored among this year's distinguished PACE Award finalists.\"\nSponsored by Automotive News, Ernst & Young and the Transportation Research Center Inc., the annual PACE Awards honor superior innovation, technological advancement and business performance among automotive suppliers. Known around the world as the industry symbol of innovation, PACE stands for Premier Automotive Suppliers' Contribution to Excellence. Winners are selected by an independent panel of judges and will be announced in Detroit on April 11, 2016 .
