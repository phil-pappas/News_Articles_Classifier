Disney Resort is gearing up to open its doors in Shanghai in early 2016 and Universal Studios , which Steven Spielberg will help design, is slated to arrive in Beijing in 2019. \nNot to be outdone, the Chinese government opened its very own Communist theme park on Monday in the city of Wuhan. The opening of the three million-square-foot \"educational park\" conveniently comes just days before the \"Golden Week,\" a seven-day public holiday from Oct. 1 to 7 commemorating China National Day.

It features sculptures, interactive experience areas, and galleries themed on the Chinese flag, the lives and work of major Communist Party figures and the party's history.

In 2001, former Soviet republic Lithuania opened Grutas Park -- nicknamed \"Stalin's World\" -- featuring statues of Vladimir Lenin, Josef Stalin and other Soviet party leaders. In the early 2000s, Serbian businessman Blasko Gabric built \" Yugoland \" in the former Soviet republic of Lithuania, where people could take part in communist sing-alongs, buy communist merchandise, and even obtain virtual Yugoslavian passports . While Grutas Park remains a popular tourist attraction , Yugoland has since been shut down due to lack of funding. \nAnd in China particularly, \" red tourism \" is back on the rise, where millions flock to parks like the one in Wuhan to enhance their \"patriotic education.\" In 2008, China's Wuxiang county opened a cultural park featuring stage shows and trips that allowed visitors to experience life as a guerrilla fighter in the Sino-Japanese War of 1937-1945.

Millions flock to parks and historical sites to enhance their \"patriotic education.\" \nThe propaganda-filled park seems to have attracted some enthusiastic supporters on its first day. Some 300 attended the opening ceremony and festivities, the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, reported. Some of the shouts overheard at the park were: \n\"What do you see?\" \n\"Prosperity! And you?\" \n\"Civilization!\" \nThe Internet wasn't so hot about the news, however. Critics on Weibo, China's microblogging website, lamented the park's opening, calling it a waste of taxpayers' money , The Guardian reported Thursday.
