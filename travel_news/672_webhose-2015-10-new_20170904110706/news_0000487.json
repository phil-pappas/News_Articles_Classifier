Think again! \nFrench people often get a bad rap. \nFellow European and people around the world like to joke that they're a lazy group of people who spend their time going on strike or going on holiday. \nMy mum was born in France, I have many French relatives, and I have visited the country many times. \nHere's my attempt to counter some of the myths out there about French people. \nALL FRENCH WOMEN ARE CHIC AND FASHIONABLE \nYes, you're likely to run into a number of well-dressed women on the streets of Paris and St. Tropez. \nBut there's more to France than just the big name cities, and I can assure you that there are plenty of women who live in smaller cities and towns in the countryside who aren't particularly concerned with whether they're wearing Dior or H&M. \nJust because French men like to dress well, doesn't mean they are not 'real men'. Flickr / Miwok \nFRENCH WOMEN DON'T SHAVE \nAccording to a Quora thread , this rumour originated during WWII when American soldiers returned home and claimed that French women were hairy. Even if this is true, that was a while ago, and it's safe to say that French women today do shave - trust me, I've seen enough of them on French beaches to know this. \nSure, there are probably some who choose to go au naturale, but that's not an inherently French thing; there are some American women who make that same choice. \nFRENCH MEN ARE EFFEMINATE \nEffeminate should not be confused with having some sense of style. The most obvious example I can think of to dispel this notion is the fact that some French men wear scarves. In the US, scarves are seen as an accessory more commonly worn by women than by men. In France, they're more unisex. It's as simple as that. Just because French men wouldn't be caught dead in basketball shorts and a T-shirt doesn't mean they're any less masculine for it. \nTHE FRENCH ARE LAZY AND DON'T WORK MORE THAN 35 HOURS PER WEEK \nWhile there is in fact a 35-hour work week law in France - known as loi Aubry - it's gone through a lot of changes in recent years and now it's basically a threshold or a minimum for workers, that once exceeded, leads to paid overtime for employees. \nAnd according to the Guardian , France is more productive than both Britain and Germany, and the number of hours the French have worked in recent years has increased. In 2012, full-time employees in France worked an average of 39.5 hours per week. Maybe the French don't work as much as us, but contrary to popular belief, they also don't spend their life on holiday. \nIf you thought all of France ate snails all the time, you are very wrong.

Although escargot (snails) and cuisses de grenouilles (frog legs) are French delicacies, they're far from a staple in the French diet. I've been to France multiple times and have only had snails once and have never even tried frog legs. In reality, some French staples would be very appealing to the average non-French person: steak and fries, grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, and chocolate croissants, just to name a few. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:21:40.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
