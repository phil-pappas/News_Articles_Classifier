For over a decade, the best hotels in the UK have significantly underinvested in IT. With this, the hospitality industry in the UK has faced serious consequences. The emergence and dominance of OTAs or Online Travel Agents in the recent years have provided great impact in the bottom line profits of the hotels in the UK. To be able to surface and win the battle against OTA and to generate bookings through their own proprietary websites, IT investment is needed. In addition to this, the hospitality industry has fallen behind on the other service industries especially in addressing the revolution of data insights. As a result, the best hotels in UK are not as competitive as they should be in the loyalty schemes and customer relationship management field. With the fast changing technology and with today’s competitive climate, investing to the right IT can be crucial.\nThe need to determine the guest behaviors in terms of booking and spend patterns, the use of the data in gathering relevant information such as researching trends and cost behavior of the guest is highly important in the customer relationship management field. Just like what a hotel owner in Japan have done, the launching of Robots as hotel concierge where it will greet guests carry their bags and clean their rooms as they leave. These robots are designed with an eerily realistic female face and are able to speak several languages and are expected to respond to guest inquiries anytime. The aim for employing life-like robots is to create an all-around hi-tech experience that includes facial recognition software for door opening. As there are no imminent threat yet for Japan’s receptionist and bell boy employees, the wider hotel business in Japan only show that they are embracing new technologies.\nSo why can’t the UK hotel industry do the same? The major barrier in achieving the modern IT system for some hotel owners is that the hotel industry does not know who to trust. As IT is an enormous subject to be tackled in addition to the complexity of the hotel industry’s IT systems. For some business sectors, employing a diverse set of IT skill is obtainable. Unfortunately for the hotel industry and its complex IT system, employing a team of proficient IT people is not truly viable. From the infrastructure providers and IT vendors to high end IT consultants that are commanding large fees, making a critical business decision makes the hotel industry reliant on IT Vendors. As IT has a language of its own, many hotel owners and managers has no understanding on what is being sold to them. Which is why, it is best to look for unbiased IT experts that have in-depth knowledge in the hospitality industry to provide an advice on what type of system is suited on such operation. The best hotels in the UK that are able to get hold of such good IT system have been able to utilize and maximize its potential and support the hotel's future plans for growth as effectively and efficiently as possible.\nAbout The County Hotel Bath\nThe well-renowned company is an award-winning hotel in Bath, Somerset that provides all their guests and clients with an extremely luxurious experience with their superior facilities and services without having to pay exorbitant fees.
