And when it comes to on-island accommodations, those visitors have plenty from which to choose. \nThe Ritz-Carlton, Aruba opened in November 2013 and sits on Palm Beach, one of the most pristine beaches found on the island. Guests can choose from 320 guest rooms, including 55 oceanview and oceanfront suites ranging from a Junior Suite to the Ritz-Carlton Suite, each with private balcony, deep full-size tubs with separate showers, and in-room Internet access. Throughout the resort’s grounds, guests find two pools (one for adults only), an expansive beach, a 15,000 square foot spa and four restaurants from which to choose to dine. When the sun goes down, the action heats up inside the 24-hour casino with slots and traditional table games such as Blackjack, Craps and Texas Holdem Bonus. \nThe gallery above showcases the resort’s highlights, including rooms, restaurants, pools and, of course, the beach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:56:22.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
