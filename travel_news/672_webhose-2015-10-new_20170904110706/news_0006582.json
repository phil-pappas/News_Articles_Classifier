It was designed by Piero Lissoni for Boffi, and has a custom island and professional appliances by Gaggenau and Miele.\nFor dining, guests have access to 24-hour room service by The Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges, and can request an al fresco dining experience on the terrace with an exclusive menu prepared by three-Michelin-starred chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.\nThanks to the hotel’s partnership with luxury goods department store Bergdorf Goodman, guests have access to around-the-clock service, meaning they can get their suits tailored at midnight if they fancy it.\nThey also have access to in-suite hair styling by the in-house Frederic Fekkai Salon, a private car and driver of their choosing, and personal training by Dan Flores.\nBilled as a ‘castle in the sky’, the palatial space, designed by Jacques Grange, is more like a grand residence than a hotel suite\nEvery piece of furniture has been custom-designed exclusively for The Mark, which bills itself as New York’s ‘most boldly lavish hotel’\nLocated near Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Mark Hotel is a favourite retreat for A-listers and power players\nIzak Senbahar, owner of The Mark Hotel, said the penthouse is the culmination of a near-decade long collaboration with Mr Grange.\nHe told MailOnline Travel in a statement: ‘The Mark penthouse oozes pure sex appeal for your wedding night, is beyond palatial for entertaining – with a ballroom to boot – and private enough to transact your multinational M&A deal, all at the same time. We are in the business of creating memorable experiences.’\nFor Mr Grange, his work on the penthouse suite is his largest project to date.\nHe said in a statement: ‘This majestic penthouse is the ultimate residence away from home for those who truly appreciate rarified luxury, who seek a grand space that is equally equipped to lavishly entertain as it is to provide a homely private oasis with the extraordinary amenities and services The Mark Hotel offers. It is really like a castle in the sky.’\nWith old-world charm and avant-garde design, The Mark Hotel is set in an Art Deco building with 106 rooms and 50 suites, in addition to the penthouse.\nThe penthouse will no doubt be occupied by celebrity guests next spring, when the hotel is teeming with famous faces, fans and paparazzi ahead of the star-studded Met Gala.\nGiven its proximity to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the lavish hotel is a popular hangout for stars before and after the event, which draws a who’s who of A-listers and raises funds for the museum’s Costume Institute.\nRead more: 5 Star Luxury Hotels in Manhattan NYC | The Mark Hotel | New York City Luxury Hotels", "external_links": ["http://www.themarkhotel.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1L8upoq"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:30:22.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
