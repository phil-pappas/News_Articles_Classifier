But there is a new restaurant in Cologne that combines modern fine dining with a focus on families and children.\nEat, drink, play and explore – at THE KIDCHEN restaurant in Cologne as it’s all about creating an experience for children.\nHead chef Jens Dannenfeld, who has twice been awarded a Michelin star, conjures up imaginative names for his dishes designed for younger diners. All the while, the star chef stays true to his heart by producing fresh and regional dishes that encourage children to eat healthily.\nThe restaurant, which opened in June, has much more to offer than just its fun children’s menu. While you enjoy your food or look forward to your next course, your little ones are free to roam around a huge ‘adventure kitchen’. The restaurant has everything to make life easier for families: a play area for small children, a quiet zone for breastfeeding, pushchair parking and baby changing facilities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:14:53.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
