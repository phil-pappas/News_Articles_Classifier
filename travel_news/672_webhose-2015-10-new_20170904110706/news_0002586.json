Persuasion, as he put it, “happens to be not a science, but an art”. \nFor Marriott International that art of persuasion has lately taken on a distinctly new form. The hotel group’s marketing campaigns used to be deployed via billboards, print ads and television spots but in the past year it has added original film production to the mix. Financing and producing two short movies is more in keeping with a media company than a hotel operator. More Lord Bilimoria UK should be more open \nThe first film, Two Bellmen , a light-hearted heist of just under 20 minutes set at its hotel in Los Angeles, has been viewed more than 5m times on YouTube. A second, French Kiss , 25 minutes, was set at a Marriott property in Paris, while a Two Bellmen sequel is in the works. \nMarriott is not about to start competing with Hollywood studios by releasing films in cinemas, as Karin Timpone, its global marketing officer, acknowledges. But it has similar aims to media companies. “[They] look for audiences they can monetise and brands can now do the same thing,” she says. “We want to get people to think of our hotels and get into their attention space in the same way.” \nOriginal content produced by brands — usually called branded content — is part of a growing trend in advertising. The branded content market is forecast to increase 20 per cent a year in the US, from $10bn in 2014 to $25bn in 2019, according to recent research from Boston Consulting Group, the management consulting firm. \nBrands underwriting original content is not new. As far back as 1895 John Deere, the farming equipment maker, began producing The Furrow , a magazine aimed at the farming community. Marriott also dabbled in early forms of original content marketing: in the 1960s, its Hot Shoppe diner chain produced a comic book aimed at younger customers. \nBut this latest twist on the genre is quite different, given that Marriott is the creator, producer — and distributor — of the videos. As well as the films, it recently commissioned a Hot Shoppe animated series, which will run to five episodes and air on YouTube. \nMs Timpone knows something about storytelling — in a previous job she was a senior marketing executive at Walt Disney — and says digital distribution has changed the game for brands. “I remember thinking that one day there would be technology available that would let you get movies out to anyone who wanted to see them,” she says. “Everyone in the content business needs to look at what has changed in the economics of making it.” \nThe mini-movies form one part of Marriot’s developing approach to marketing; it has also created a news “studio” at its Bethesda headquarters in Maryland. Called M Live, it is designed to bring together the company’s public relations teams, an in-house creative agency and media buyers. \nThe studio is staffed 24 hours a day — “It’s a real-time command centre,” Ms Timpone says — with the aim of reacting rapidly and producing quick-fire content that can latch on to topics that are trending on social media. The newsroom team works from a calendar of events, such as the Super Bowl and recent Emmy awards, but is also ready to dive into stories or themes that emerge on social networks such as Twitter. \nOther companies have experimented with rapid-reaction social media campaigns. The best, such as the impromptu tweet by the Oreo cookie brand during a blackout in the 2013 Super Bowl ( “You can still dunk in the dark” ) can be propelled to a vast online audience that shares and distributes it because they are amused or because they can relate to it. <!--.--> \nCreating content that catches fire in this way is the goal at M Live, says Ms Timpone. This summer was the 10th anniversary of the theft of the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz . When an anonymous donor offered a $1m reward for the return of the slippers, the Marriott newsroom observed the resulting flurry of stories. \nIt quickly drew up a campaign — Ms Timpone calls it “quick-fire activation” — offering its own reward of 1m points in the Marriott Rewards loyalty scheme. It bought space on the biggest billboard in New York’s Times Square and caught the trending topic on social media. The campaign reached 4.5m people on Twitter and many more on Facebook and Instagram, according to the company’s analysis. “It was about tapping into a social conversation,” Ms Timpone says. \nThe movie studio and marketing “newsroom” are in line with a push to reach younger, potential customers who might stay in a Marriott hotel. In recent years the company has devoted more attention to this demographic by branching out beyond its core business-travel brands, such as Courtyard, and its Ritz-Carlton luxury chain, with properties aimed at more style-conscious travellers. \nMarriott was late to the boutique hotel boom and Bill Marriott, its former chief executive, resisted following rivals such as Starwood, owner of the W brand, into this sector until a change of heart led to a partnership with Ian Schrager, the veteran hotelier and one of the pioneers of the boutique concept. \nMore recently, under the leadership of Arne Sorenson, its chief executive, Marriott has created new brands skewed towards more stylish consumers. The hotel group launch­ed Edition, a boutique chain with properties in London, New York and Miami, with Mr Schrager, while another new brand — Moxy — is launching across the US. For Marriott, this means, says Ms Timpone, that there are still many travellers who are not aware that it has different kinds of hotels, which they might want to stay in. \nIt can reach these potential customers through its fresh approach to marketing, she believes. “There are all these new distribution channels and more desire for personalised content.” \nYet even as technology and distribution have changed, the fundamental goals of marketing remain the same, she says. “We have to draw [consumers] out and have them stay loyal to us for a long time.” Digital’s new battles \nBrands are facing new digital challenges on more than one front. As consumers’ television viewing habits change and they spend more hours online, companies are shifting more of their spending to online campaigns. Research firm eMarketer estimates that global digital ad spending will increase 18 per cent in 2015 to reach $170.2bn, close to 30 per cent of the total international advertising market. \nThe growth of digital advertising has its own challenges, such as adblocking software. This is expected to have a significant effect on whether campaigns are seen by the intended audience. A report from PageFair, an ad blocker specialist, and Adobe estimates that ad blockers will cost the advertising industry $22bn in 2015. \nThe search for new ways to reach consumers is placing more emphasis on branded content and social media campaigns. Some big companies are moving marketing money into this area. For example, GE and National Geographic Channel are developing a science-themed TV series produced by Imagine Entertainment’s Ron Howard and Brian Grazer.
