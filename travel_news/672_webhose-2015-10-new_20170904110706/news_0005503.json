No wonder why people flock to this state for their honeymoons and all special moments. I have never been to Jammu and Kashmir but have heard a lot about it. So, the coming vacations, I am planning to visit Srinagar, which is the prized possession of the Vale of Kashmir. Imbibing many colours of the state, Srinagar is called the true reflection of authentic Jammu & Kashmir. The city sits quietly on the bank of Jhelum and contemplates the vivaciousness. The canopied Shikara boats, plush houseboats, snow-capped mountains and the sparkling water of Dal and Nageen Lake come together to bring the picture of authentic Srinagar come alive. I have read all this but now want to experience it myself. The next in my list is Leh, the land of queer beauty and sheer adventure. The lofty mountains, the alpine lakes, divine Gompas and the quaint settings make Leh one of the best places to visit in Jammu & Kashmir. Located 434 kms from Srinagar, it majorly intrigues adventure enthusiasts and people with artistic bent of mind. \nThe architectural grandeur of spiritual places like Alchi Monastery, Hemis Monastery, Matho Monastery, Spituk Monastery and Thiksey Monastery dazzles visitors, whereas General Zorawar fort, Stok Palace and Jama Masjid has the potential to surprise spectators. You might be wondering as to how I know so much about these places because till now, I am just planning to go there, and I haven't been there. So, how is it possible for me to know about all this in detail? This is because I have already booked the best tour operator in Jammu and Kashmir and he is the one who has sent me a complete itinerary of my forthcoming travel. This is the advantage of hiring a local tour operator as he knows the best of places around. I just told him that I need to explore the state and my budget is so and so. He worked around with some options and gave me the best ones to choose from. He advised me about where to travel as well as the best means of reaching local destinations. He has also done transport and accommodation arrangements. I am thrilled to visit Jammu and Kashmir and pretty comfortable because I know everything has been taken care of. And once I am back, I will certainly pen down all my memories to share it with you. I am author of this article and write on behalf of vaishnodevijammu.com.
