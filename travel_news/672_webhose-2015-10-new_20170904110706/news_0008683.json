Over the past few years, overnight trips by disabled tourists and their companions have increased by 19 per cent, and their spending is up by a third.\n“VisitEngland estimates that the overall annual value of overnight accessible tourism to Derbyshire is £45m, so it makes sense for local businesses to invest in improving their facilities and services for this key sector of the market,” said Lindsay Rae, Deputy Director and Head of Industry Engagement at Visit Peak District & Derbyshire.\n“We’re delighted that eight businesses across the Peak District and Derbyshire have had the opportunity to review and improve their accessibility thanks to this pioneering Access for All project, and we’re very grateful to Accessible Derbyshire for their expertise in helping to make it a success for all involved.”\nSally Ambrose, Head of Marketing and Visitor Services at Chatsworth said: “Chatsworth is delighted to be part of VisitEngland’s Access for All initiative. We have always been committed to providing the best possible service to all our visitors, including those with mobility impairments, and this scheme has enabled us to ensure we are constantly improving our facilities to provide the best possible visitor experience for all.”\nSarah Fowler, Chief Executive of the Peak District National Park, said: “We’re delighted to be part of the Access For All campaign, which is helping get the message out that we have fabulous opportunities for people to experience for themselves and enjoy our inspirational landscapes with accessible facilities, a wide range of adapted bikes and miles of traffic-free, safe and easy to ride fun trails for everyone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:55:42.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
