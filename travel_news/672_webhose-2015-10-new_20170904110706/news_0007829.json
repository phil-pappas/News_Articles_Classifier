The investment comes on the heels of the brand's exceptional year with recent debuts in New York , New Jersey , San Francisco and Orange County . Sequoia partner Omar Hamoui has joined the Clutter board. The investment brings Clutter's total funding to $12.3 million , and will help the company aggressively expand its sales and marketing efforts as well as broaden and accelerate product development. Clutter will also use the funds to expand their presence in cities and regions throughout the U.S.\n\"Self-storage is a large and fragmented market suffering from a poor user experience,\" said Omar Hamoui , partner at Sequoia and founder of AdMob. \"Clutter's focus on addressing the real consumer pain point while solving some fairly complex technical problems has positioned them for explosive growth.\"\nTwo years ago, entrepreneurs Brian Thomas and Ari Mir co-founded Clutter to take on the self-storage industry and transformed the space with on-demand pickup and delivery so people no longer have to visit inconvenient and aggravating self-storage units. With its convenient, one-click storage solution akin to a valet car service and online visual inventory of all items, Clutter is now helping its clients de-clutter, guaranteeing they never lose anything again.\n\" Sequoia's support allows us to continue national expansion while growing our existing markets: Los Angeles , New York and San Francisco ,\" says Brian Thomas , Clutter's CEO and Co-Founder. \"We're excited they value the opportunity ahead as much as we do and together we're going to make millions of consumers' lives easier.\"\nSince its inception in 2013, Clutter has been disrupting the $27 billion self-storage industry by providing transparency, world-class service and a superior product experience. Clutter takes the \"self\" out of self-storage and is first-to-market catering to both large and small storage needs through a variety of customized plan options. After visiting the company's website, users coordinate their items to be stored with free pick-up and one-hour onsite packing included in the price. Clutter's careful categorization system, which photographs and labels all belongings, allows clients to manage their inventory online and get items returned on a whim.\nAbout Clutter\nBased in Culver City, California , co-founders Brian Thomas and Ari Mir set out to make the world more convenient. Clutter's storage service allows consumers to safely and affordably store their belongings without lifting a finger. Clutter sends professional movers who can help pack and transport clients' belongings to their safe and secure storage facility. Customers can then browse their online storage unit and select photos of any items they're storing and request for them to be returned to their doorstep within 48 hours.\nAbout Sequoia\nThe Sequoia team helps a small number of daring founders build legendary companies. We spur them to push the boundaries of what's possible. In partnering with Sequoia , companies benefit from our unmatched community and the lessons we've learned over 40 years working with Steve Jobs , Larry Ellison , John Morgridge , Jerry Yang , Elon Musk , Larry Page , Jan Koum , Brian Chesky , Drew Houston , Adi Tatarko and Jack Dorsey , among many others. In aggregate, Sequoia -backed companies account for more than 20% of NASDAQ's total value. We're proud that their success also fuels great causes. The vast majority of money we invest is on behalf of non-profits and schools like the Ford Foundation, Mayo Clinic and MIT , which means that the returns generated from the incredible achievements of founders can make a massive difference.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/poised-for-growth-self-storage-company-clutter-raises-9-million-in-series-a-funding-from-sequoia-300164957.html\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
