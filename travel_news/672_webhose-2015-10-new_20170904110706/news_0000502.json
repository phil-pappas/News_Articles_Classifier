You probably already know that using your regular wireless phone can run up a huge bill: Even with an \"international\" package, you pay close to $1 a minute each for both incoming and outgoing calls -- plus, maybe, a connect charge. Of the big wireless providers, T-Mobile offers no-charge foreign roaming in Canada and Mexico and its Simple Choice plan lets you call from Europe and other popular destinations for 20 cents a minute. But with the other carriers, using you regular phone can be expensive.\nOf course, if you plan to use your phone only in emergencies, paying $1 a minute or so may not be a deal-breaker. But if you want to talk a bit more than that, and stay with your current carrier, you still have some options. I'm currently testing the two most likely approaches on my current trip to New Zealand.\nLocal or global SIM card. Lots of experts say that the best approach is to unlock your phone (if it isn't unlocked yet) and then buy and install a SIM card that is either local or global. I'm testing a global SIM card from Telestial.com that I arranged before I left home. With this package, you get two phone numbers: one based in the United States and a global number based in the UK. Rates to call the U.S. are 15 cents a minute from most of Europe; 45 cents a minute from New Zealand. Incoming calls cost nothing through the global number and 15 cents a minute from the U.S. number, all with no connecting fee. Costs for text messages are about the same. Local calls within a foreign country cost the same, or somewhat more.\nThe Telestial SIM card cost $29, including $20 of phone credit. You can arrange for automatic replenishment of credit through a credit card. You can also buy a local SIM card on arrival at most international airports that may be cheaper.\nThe big advantage to this approach is that you're always available, as long as you're in an area with wireless service. People can call you 24/7. The problem is with Apple phones, which can be problematic to unlock.\nVOIP App. For a serious phone habit, you can't beat an Internet-based calling program. As long as you're connected to a Wi-Fi network, you can call anywhere in the world for 2 to 3 cents a minute and calls to and from other folks with the same app cost nothing. I'm testing the system from wirelesstraveler.com, but several others provide a similar deal. Costs per minute are based solely on the country you're calling, not the country from which you place the call. Calls to the U.S. cost 2 cents a minute from most of Europe and 3 cents a minute from New Zealand; most incoming calls cost 3 cents a minute.\nYou load the free app, either Android or Apple, install it, select a payment system and you're ready to go. You get a U.S. number, which people can use to call you as a local U.S. call. Ease of use and voice clarity are a bit better than with the SIM card. Several travel companies offer their own \"private brand\" version of WirelessTraveler, with preinstalled connections.\nThe big problem with VOIP calling is that you have to be logged onto a local Wi-Fi network to make or receive calls. And logging in can be a bit cumbersome, at least for someone with a fat thumb who has lots of trouble entering network names and passwords from one of those tiny \"keyboards\" that mobile phones provide. Still, you can't beat the low rates -- and especially \"free\" to others on the same system.\nThe takeaway is that both approaches work as advertised. Pick your preference -- or go with both.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins(at)mind.net.
