The new handset features a 13MP rear-facing sapphire cover lens and front-facing UltraPixel camera, with Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor and 5-inch AMOLED display with 1,920 x 1,080 resolution. It will come in two iterations, 16GB and 32GB, and support up to 2TB in SD card storage. Carbon grey and opal silver will be the two colour options available at launch, with deep garnet and topaz gold following several weeks after. The in HTC One A9 in carbon grey and opal silver The more cynical among you may point out its strong resemblance to the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus ' anodised aluminium frames, bar HTC's centre-camera positioning. It also sports a multi-directional fingerprint scanner in its home button for the first time, which, like the iPhone, can store up to five prints and will be used to make purchases through Android Pay once it reaches the UK in the next few months. Its textured power button on the right-hand side of the frame is a point of differentiation, the company said. However, the A9 may prove to be an extremely clever move for HTC indeed. Its combination of a sleek, iPhone-esque frame with the best version of Android to date could be extremely appealing to a lucrative segment of consumers. The new handset's back In the hand, the A9's brushed hairline detail lends it a decent grip and at 5-inches, its screen is larger than the iPhone 6s' 4.7-inch display. Android Marshmallow: fast and functional HTC has focused on optimising the phone's camera functions, including optical image stablisation and the ability to convert previously shot video footage into hyperlapse. Like the One M9 , released earlier this year, the front-facing lens uses HtC's UltraPixel sensor to capture 300pc more light than regular cameras, the company claims. The Taiwanese manufacturer is going through a difficult period as of late. It announced operating losses of NT$4.94bn (Â£100m) for the three months ending September 30 earlier this month, in the wake of announcing plans to slash its workforce by up to 15pc. Sales over the past four years have fallen as it struggles to compete with the market dominance of Samsung and Apple, the latter of which is estimated to account for 90pc of all profits made by the smartphone industry. The One M9 will remain HTC's flagship smartphone, with the A9 priced slightly cheaper when it goes on sale in early November. telegraphsciencetech", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:31:44.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
