If you’re an Amazon Prime member (or want to become one), you can watch its movies and TV episodes through its app. This opens up a new world for travelers who like to have their entertainment with them at all times. Simultaneous downloads are a plus. My favorite feature was in Settings. Go to “Download Quality” and select from “Good, Better or Best” default download qualities to save time and storage. You can watch your downloaded movies on international soil, but if you forget to download them before your trip, you can add content (over the Internet) in countries where the app is available (currently the U.S., Britain, Germany and Austria).\nWhat’s not: Make sure you have plenty of space on your device to store the movies. I did not. Although it was great that I could simultaneously download one adult drama and one kid-friendly movie, my iPhone would periodically stop when out of room. I had to delete some apps to continue downloading. I hope future versions will include a page where I can monitor the progress of my downloads in one place instead of opening each individually.\n— Jen Leo, Los Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:23:38.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
