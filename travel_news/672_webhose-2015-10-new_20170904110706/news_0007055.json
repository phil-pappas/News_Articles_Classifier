It is the first hybrid plug-in vehicle in the national UhaulCarShare fleet.\nThis partnership provides the student body, faculty and staff at Southern Maine Community College , as well as residents of South Portland , with a sustainable transportation option to travel around their community. In one cost-effective package, UhaulCarShare gives members the freedom a car provides without the financial burden.\nThe electric hybrid vehicle fits in with the college's commitment to environmental sustainability and social responsibility. The vehicle is available for use every hour of every day. An eco-friendly form of transportation, each UhaulCarShare vehicle takes up to 20 personally-owned vehicles off the road, reduces parking congestion and improves air quality.\n\"This car offers an affordable transportation option that reduces our carbon footprint and is particularly beneficial to students who don't have a vehicle on campus,\" said SMCC President Ron Cantor . \"It provides students, employees and members of the community the convenience of using a car without the hassles of owning one.\"\nUhaulCarShare has a unique yet flexible rate system that allows people 18 and older to enjoy all the benefits of driving without having to worry about overpaying for mileage. With no start-up application fee or annual-membership dues, drivers pay only for what they use. Vehicles can be reserved on the spot for as little as an hour and up to three days. With guaranteed low pricing, the C-MAX Energi can be reserved at $4.95 per hour plus mileage or $62 per day. For those who drive longer distances, UhaulCarShare offers a capped rate which includes 180 free miles.\n\"UhaulCarShare is a valuable and practical way to make transportation available to those in need in one convenient package,\" said Mariah Reid, UhaulCarShare program director. \"In addition, the service provides peace of mind of knowing that insurance, maintenance, reserved parking spots and 24/7 roadside assistance are included in the rates.\"\nAbout UhaulCarShare\nContact:\nAndrea Batchelor\nJeff Lockridge\nEmail: publicrelations@uhaul.com\nPhone: 602-263-6194\nWebsite: uhaul.com\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uhaulcarshare-cruises-into-southern-maine-community-college-300159077.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://new.uhaulcarshare.com/home/howitworks", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA27220&Transmission_Id=201510140900PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA27220&DateId=20151014", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "https://uhaulcarshare.com/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=pressrelease&utm_medium=news", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uhaulcarshare-cruises-into-southern-maine-community-college-300159077.html", "http://www.uhaul.com/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=pressrelease&utm_medium=news"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:25:13.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
