Don't miss the hub of Grafton St in the southern city centre, stopping to admire the country's oldest and most magnificent university, Trinity College. If you want more, take a stroll around the Georgian district to admire the many fine public and private buildings. For places of interest not easily accessed on foot, take a Dublin Bus Hop on Hop off city tour - it stops at all the attractions and provides a double-decker perspective on central Dublin. \n2 THROUGH ITS LITERATURE \nFrom Shaw to Wilde, Yeats to Joyce, Ireland's illustrious literary heritage is celebrated at Dublin Writers Museum, housed in a charming 18th century mansion in the north city centre. The museum's collection includes letters, books, portraits and personal items. Step back in time at Marsh's Library, an exquisite scholar's library almost unchanged over three centuries, next to St Patrick's Cathedral. If these seem too highbrow, there's always the option of a Dublin Literary Pub Crawl. \n3 VIA THE PAST \nHistory buffs are spoilt for choice in Dublin. Top historic attractions include the treasure trove that is the National Museum of Ireland - Archaeology, tracing the development of Irish civilisation from the arrival of the first people in the Middle Stone Age. Explore the soaring St Patrick's Cathedral, which dates from around 1190, where Handel's Messiah was first performed in 1742. At Trinity College, see is the famous AD800 illuminated manuscript, the Book of Kells (but get there early to avoid the queues). \n3 IN A NEIGHBOURHOOD \nSpend some time in a Dublin neighbourhood and you'll get a deeper sense of daily life. With its bohemian bent by day and raucous taste for fun at night, Temple Bar is ripe for exploration. It's also the city's cultural heart, so if browsing vintage shops or hitting the bars isn't for you, check out the galleries, bookstores and historic buildings instead. \n5 AT THE BAR Ad Feedback \nWhat better way to soak up this city than in a pub? Firm downtown favourites with locals and visitors alike include The Stag's Head, which opened in 1770 and has starred in many movies, the ornate Victorian pub Long Hall, and John Mulligan's, built in 1782 and according to Lonely Planet, has one of the finest pints in Guinness in Dublin and a colourful crew of regulars. \nThen there's the Guinness Storehouse, Dublin's most popular attraction, located in the heart of the Guinness Brewery. Learn how Ireland's most popular export is produced and then adjourn to the Gravity Bar for a tasting or three while drinking in the panoramic views. \nGETTING THERE Emirates flies three A380 aircraft from Auckland and a Boeing 777 aircraft from Christchurch to their hub in Dubai every day. From there, Kiwis can connect with two daily Emirates flights to Dublin. See emirates.com/nz \nSTAYING THERE The Gresham is a comfortable four-star hotel big on old-world elegance. Opened in 1817 in an ideal location on the north side of the river, it is the oldest surviving hotel in Dublin and is a city landmark. Standard double rooms from around €125 (NZ$215) per night.
