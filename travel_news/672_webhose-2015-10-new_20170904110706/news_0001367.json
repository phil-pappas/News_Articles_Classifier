The book is valid for 10 years, and the agency is preparing for an onslaught of renewals from the WHTI Generation. ADVERTISEMENT \n“We encourage passport applicants to apply for or renew U.S. passports well ahead of planned travel,” said Brenda Sprague, deputy assistant secretary for passport services, “as we anticipate longer-than-average wait times for passport processing” starting around the new year. \nTo handle the deluge, the department has added more than 550 passport services employees since 2007 and plans to hire more in the next two years. It also opened 10 new passport agencies across the country and may expand call-center hours during the next few years. \nProcessing time is, on average, four to six weeks, but could stretch to 10. The agency is expecting 16 million applications in 2016 and 20 million in 2017. \nMail is the quickest and cheapest route to renewal; you can find all of the forms and requirements on the State Department’s website at http://travel.state.gov/ .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:10:54.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
