The government has also increased the number of immigration check points which can provide the visa-free facility. While entry points remain at the same five airports and nine seaports, the exit points now include 19 airports and 29 seaports. \n\nImmigration at Soekarno Hatta International Airport.

Arief Yahya, Indonesia’s minister of tourism, said: “The new regulation lifts the cabotage rights for international cruises and yachts. Now, international cruise liners are allowed to lift and disembark passengers in five Indonesian seaports.” \n\nThese seaports are Tanjung Priok Jakarta, Tanjung Perak Surabaya, Belawan Medan, Soekarno-Hatta Makassar and Benoa Bali. Formerly, only Indonesian-flagged ships had the rights to lift and disembark passengers in Indonesian waters. \n\n“The regulation also makes it easier for foreign yacht owners to obtain permits in 18 seaports around the country. We expect this will boost yacht arrivals to Indonesia to reach 6,000 yachts by 2019 and contributing US$600 million in earnings,” added Yahya.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:19:54.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
