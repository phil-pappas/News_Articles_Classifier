(Photo: NBC News 4) \nIt’s the kind of thing that should never happen. \nA man with disabilities had to crawl off a plane at Reagan National Airport after United Airlines forgot about him. \nD’Arcce Neal has cerebral palsy and relies on his wheelchair for transportation. He says that as others deplaned, he was left waiting for the airline to bring him an aisle chair. \nNo one ever came. \nNeal needed to use the restroom, so he took matters into his own hands. \n“I decided to get out and crawl down the plane, to my chair, got in it, and then just went about my business and left the airport,”Neal told NBC’s News 4 . \n“It’s humiliating. No one should have to do what I did.” \nRelated: Woman in Wheelchair Forced to Crawl Onto Plane — Sues American Airlines \nThe National Disability Rights Network has received thousands of complaints about inaccessible travel. (Photo: iStock) \nNeal is an advocate for people with disabilities and was actually returning from a trip to San Francisco, where he had just given a speech about accessible transportation. \n“Half the time I feel like airlines treat people with disabilities as a secondary concern,” said Neal. \nAccording to News 4, United Airlines said it regrets the delay in providing an aisle chair to assist Neal. \nSadly, this kind of thing has happened before. \nIn June, Theresa Purcell announced that she was suing American Airlines after she was forced to crawl onto a plane. \nAccording to Purcell, she was boarding a commuter plane from San Diego to Hawaii when the gate agent told her it was too late for them to set up the wheelchair ramp. Left with no other option, she had to crawl onto the plane as others watched. \nIn an interview with News 4, Dara Baldwin of the National Disability Rights Network confirms that this is an issue that has occurred on various airlines. \n“In 2014 there were over 27,500 complaints in reference to things like this, so it is not uncommon,” she said. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
