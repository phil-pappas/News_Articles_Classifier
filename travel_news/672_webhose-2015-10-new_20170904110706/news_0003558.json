Allows a dentist to perform his duties in a good manner for a shorter period of time. Reasonable prices for treatment. There is no need for hospitalization as the patient in 20-40 minutes after an anesthesia comes back to full-fledged consciousness. There is no need of collecting a set of sickness certificates and analyses – the decision to carry out an anesthesia (at the consent of patients/parents) is made by the anesthesiologist so he or she can independently estimate contraindications for anesthesia. \nOUR OFFER: Aesthetic restoration of teeth with application of veneers and laminates First-class dental prosthetics with the use of modern materials and technologies Bite correction and modeling of a smile by bracket systems of the last generation, including self-ligating braces Damon, metal, sapphire, titanic, lingual braces Implantation and removal of teeth with restoration of a bone tissue General anesthesia High level of service and perfect monitoring system of an infection Extract from the price-list 121 articles posted.
