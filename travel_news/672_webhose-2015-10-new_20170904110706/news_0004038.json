Vanderslice, global head, Waldorf Astoria Hotels & Resorts, in a statement. “Waldorf Astoria is committed to culinary excellence at each of the brand’s more than 140 world-class bars, lounges, and specialty restaurants worldwide.” Recently, Waldorf Astoria paid homage to its namesake Waldorf Salad with a recipe contest in partnership with the California Walnut Commission, which represents the leading growers of one of the dish’s key ingredients. For the Waldorf Salad Refresh contest, consumers were asked to share their own take on the salad for the chance to win a stay at the chain’s New York flagship and $5,000.
