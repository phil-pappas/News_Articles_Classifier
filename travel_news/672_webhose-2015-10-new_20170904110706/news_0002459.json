Tram lines: 3, 7 or 9. Features: Huge grassy field; stretches of shady, waterfront lawn; large winding pond that attracts large water birds; children's wading pool; dog-friendly and dog-free zones; wide-paved paths for through bikers. One permanent food vendor; others are seasonal. Attracts mostly locals, who make up one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in Amsterdam, home to a large Surinamese, Indonesian and Indian population. Popular with musicians, couples and families. Ideal for a longer park visit, as it lies quite far east of the center. Plenty of room for sports and group gatherings of all kinds. Located just behind the imposing KIT Tropenmuseum (KIT stands for Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen, or Royal Tropical Institute), which was formerly dedicated to Dutch colonialism and now houses a fascinating anthropological museum about the developing world. Oosterpark is home to the free, open-air portion of the Amsterdam Roots Festival , a world music festival held every June in Amsterdam. The park has several pieces of sculpture; perhaps the most moving is the National Monument of the History of Slavery (titled \"Shared Past, Common Future\"), which acknowledges the country's inhumane trade that brought the ancestors of this neighborhood to the Netherlands.
