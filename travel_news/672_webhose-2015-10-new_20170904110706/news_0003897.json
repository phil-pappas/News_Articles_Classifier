Morris gift shop in San Francisco and completed in 1951. It has a wide roof, supported by the central chimney, which bears the roof's weight and allows almost-unbroken casement windows on the ocean side. Design details include repeated horizontal elements.\nA master bedroom was added in 1956. In the 1959 movie \"A Summer Place,\" (which was ostensibly set on the East Coast) characters Ken and Sylvia mention that their beachfront house was designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright - and indeed it was. The film shows views of the Walker House's interior and exterior and from the patio. \nScenic Road at Ocean View AvenueCarmel, CAPrivate Residence, no public tours Photo Credit: Â©2010   Permission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:37:19.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
