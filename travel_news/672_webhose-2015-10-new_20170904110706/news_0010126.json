He understood and was compliant, returning the sign without resistance,” he said. \nBut motorists say he continued to obstruct drivers after going home and returning with a homemade sign. \nHis protest, which lasted more than two hours, was aimed at stopping people from using Frys Lane to get from Wainsford Road to Everton Road. \nOne woman who took to social media said: “Very intimidating for lone drivers, who had to stop and turn around to find other route.” \nLast night people living in the area stopped short of condoning his attempt to stop the traffic. Promoted stories \nBut they praised him for drawing attention to traffic issues and urged highway chiefs to take a fresh look at the problem. \nDavid Ironside, chairman of Hordle Parish Council added: “Frys Lane is a very narrow country lane that tends to be used as a rat-run by people who drive too fast, thus creating a safety issue. \n“We have suggested various options over the years. \n“However, residents wouldn’t want us to close one end of the road and I can’t see a way of widening it because there are houses on both sides. \n“If there was a simple solution I’m sure it would have been implemented by now.” \nA parish council spokesman added: “We have previously been made aware of concerns by some local residents about cars using Frys Lane and other routes that are meant to be access only. Share article \n“We take the issue of speeding and traffic in general very seriously, which is why we have set up SpeedWatch with local volunteers.” \nNo-one from Hampshire County Council was available for comment.

When you have people doing 75mph in a 40 zone on a daily basis, what is going to happen. It is a rat run, so is Mill lane Emery down, there are many more like it in the area.
