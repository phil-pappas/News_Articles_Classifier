Disney The 2015 season has barely wound down, but theme parks are already hyping what's on the way for 2016. We've highlighted the top coasters that will be rolling out next year. Now, let's take a look at everything else that's coming to parks soon from a king-sized hairy ape to a mega-popular Harry wizard.\nHarry Potter and the Forbidden Journey at Universal Studios Hollywood, Hollywood, Calif.\nThere will be all kinds of rides and attractions, big and small, opening in 2016, but none is more anticipated than Forbidden Journey. It will use a robotic arm vehicle, projected media, and practical sets to whisk muggles away on an adventure with Harry and his wizard pals. The queue leading to the ride will be an adventure in itself. Guests will enter Hogwarts Castle (which is typically forbidden for muggles) and encounter oil paintings that spring to life, an indoor snowstorm, and other magical moments.\nThe ride will be similar to the existing Forbidden Journey attraction at Florida's Universal Orlando with one major difference: The media for the Hollywood version will be projected in high resolution 3D and should be sharper, brighter, and make for a more immersive experience. Forbidden Journey will be part of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which will invite visitors to explore the village of Hogsmeade and also include highly themed shows, dining, and shops.\nSkull Island: Reign of Kong at Islands of Adventure, part of Universal Orlando, Orlando, Fla.\nAt the park where Pottermania first began, an old friend will be returning. Universal's poster ape used to terrorize guests at sister park, Universal Studios Florida, until he was banished to make room for the Revenge of the Mummy indoor coaster ride. Kong's new home will be in Islands of Adventure's Jurassic Park area. If the attraction will be similar to Universal Studio Hollywood's King Kong 360 3-D (and I suspect it will), the big guy will be focused more on battling dinosaurs than defenseless park patrons. Expect a wild ride with the likelihood of some enormous animatronic creatures and Universal's trademark in-your-face action.\nJustice League: Battle for Metropolis at Six Flags Great America, Gurnee, Ill.\nSpeaking of in-your-face attractions, Six Flags will be borrowing from Universal's playbook for its DC Comics-themed ride, Battle for Metropolis, which will feature sophisticated roving motion base vehicles, 3D imagery, stunning animatronics, interactive laser guns, and other theme park trickery. Citizen recruits will be helping Superman, Batman, and their Justice League buddies defeat The Joker and Lex Luthor in their scheme to take down the Man of Steel's adopted city. Known more for soaring coasters and over-the-edge thrills, Six Flags demonstrated that it could deliver stunning, story-based, E-Ticket attractions when it debuted similar Battle for Metropolis rides in 2015 at its parks in St. Louis and Texas.\nFrozen Ever After at Epcot, Lake Buena Vista, Fla.\nDisney's Frozen juggernaut continues. In 2016, it will even invade Disney World's somewhat staid, edutainment park, Epcot. The Maelstrom attraction at the Norway pavilion is getting an Olafian makeover and will reopen as Frozen Ever After. Guests will travel by boat to Arendelle, the North Mountain, Queen Elsa's Ice Palace, and other locales from the hugely popular animated film. There will undoubtedly be a stirring chorus of \"Let It Go.\"\nFrozen Stage Musical at Disney California Adventure, Anaheim, Calif.\nSpeaking of the Frozen juggernaut, Anna, Elsa, and their Scandinavian posse will be taking over the stage from Aladdin at Disney California Adventure's Hyperion Theater. The new show will have some big, curly-toed genie shoes to fill. The Aladdin musical has been both a popular and critical success. Disney is promising some nifty effects in its retelling of the Frozen saga. And yes, there will undoubtedly be a stirring chorus of \"Let It Go.\"\nLego Ninjago - The Ride at Legoland California, Carlsbad, Calif.\nThe ninja heroes featured in the Ninjago TV show and Lego building sets use their hands to engage in martial arts. Likewise, passengers aboard the unique new 4D ride will use their hands – and only their hands – to direct lightning blasts, ice crystals, and other virtual weapons at targets and rack up points.\nMass Effect at California's Great America, Santa Clara, Calif.\nVisitors will be able to enter the science fiction realm of the popular Mass Effect videogame series next season at California's Great America. The park is retrofitting its existing Action Theater and will present a 4D adventure that will incorporate motion simulator seats, 3D media, and sensory effects. A live actor will lead guests on the intergalactic journey.\nLuigi's Rollickin' Roadsters at Disney California Adventure, Anaheim, Calif.\nCars Land, the highly immersive area at Disney California Adventure based on Pixar's Cars movies, has been wildly successful – except for Luigi's Flying Tires. The air hockey-like ride never quite worked as intended and closed earlier this year. Its replacement will invite guests to pile into anthropomorphic dancing cars at Casa della Tires. The vehicles will reportedly use a trackless ride system and be able to interact and perform sophisticated choreography with one another. It will be the first Disney park attraction in the USA to feature trackless ride technology (although SeaWorld Orlando beat Disney to the punch with its trackless Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin ride).\n241 CONNECT 213 TWEET 80 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1Lluh4N MORE STORIES", "external_links":
