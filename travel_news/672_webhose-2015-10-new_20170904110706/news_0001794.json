This means that frequent visitors to Ambergris Caye , residents, ex-pats and travelers just discovering this popular Caribbean hot spot can finally fly directly to their favorite island. \nIt was no understatement when PM Barrow talked about the “veritable tourism explosion” expected once the Jones landing strip is expanded and ultimately re-named Efrain Guerrero International Airport in honor of a San Pedro patriot who recently passed away. The airport is expected to dramatically escalate visitor numbers that totaled an impressive 321,217 overnight visitors in 2014, says the Caribbean Tourism Organization. \nOrchid Bay , an active residential community in the Corozal District of Belize (the north of Ambergris Caye) has been attracting record numbers of retirees from North America and once ex-pat residents have access to an international airport in close proximity to their homes, they won’t have to travel to the International Airport in Belize City to return home for family visits. \nFurther, current Orchid Bay homeowners anticipate exciting rises in real estate values once the new airport is in place, so the community is projected to attract even more home buyers eager to enjoy the Belize retiree lifestyle that includes everything from a laid-back vibe to generous tax breaks. \nGetting in on this boon before the new airport is open for business has the Belize tourism and real estate markets abuzz, which is why the Orchid Bay Residential Community is scheduling Buyer’s Tours –so visitors can see the community’s beauty and learn about current, affordable home prices before the airport triggers projected property value increases. \nPremier Orchid Bay Buyers tours are to be held between October 22nd and 25 th ,and November 12 th and November 15th, and will include opportunities to see Northern Belize sites in addition to the lush Orchid Bay community, but you must reserve a place to be part of this exciting tour.
