Today, companies large and small are making inroads, with some growing organically while others have used acquisitions, which have become more common since the 2008 financial crisis. One of the largest employers in Britain’s telecom sector now is Huawei, which opened its first office in the country in 2001 and works closely with local companies such as BT as well as universities. Over the past three years, the Chinese company has contributed £956 million to Britain’s GDP, according to research published in June by the think tank Oxford Economics. The report also said it had created 7,400 jobs either directly and through its supply chain. Ken Hu, rotating chief executive and a member of the Huawei UK board, said Britain’s outstanding record in fostering business growth and pioneering technological innovations make it one of the company’s most important markets. “We’re proud to make a contribution to Britain’s economy through our products and services and our groundbreaking innovation and research development,” he said. The thing we admire and respect most is that they often take a long-term view on the business More than 70 per cent of the company’s employees and most of its management team were recruited locally and Mr Hu said it planned to increase its workforce by about 200 to 1,500 by 2017. Huawei’s spending on research and development in Britain grew from £30.6 million in 2012 to £78.4 million last year. The telecom company is just one of the many high-profile Chinese enterprises operating in Britain’s financial services, technology and high-end manufacturing sectors. Four major Chinese banks – Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China – have played a large role in helping finance this growth and expansion. Many Chinese insurance firms have also established a presence in London. In November, China Reinsurance became the fi rst from China to own a syndicate on Lloyd’s of London. From 2009 to 2014, trade between China and Britain doubled, growing from $39.1 billion to $80.9 billion. Britain is China’s second-largest trading partner in the European Union and the 2015 target for trade is $100 billion (£66 billion). Since the financial crisis, British companies have welcomed fresh investment from Chinese companies. In 2010, Chongqing Machinery and Electric Co’s acquired Precision Technologies Group, a manufacturing company in Manchester, for £20 million. Precision had conducted business in China since the 1980s and since the sale has seen sales in China increase annually. Tony Bannan, chief executive of Precision, said most of the research and development work by Precision is on advanced machine tools, something that would not have been possible without support and funding from the Chinese company. “The thing we admire and respect most is that they often take a long-term view on the business. For a technology company this is ideal as it brings new growth opportunities,” he said. “British and American investors often expect returns on their investments after one or two years. But Chinese investors often say, ‘do it in three years but if it takes five we’ll still support you’.” China Railway Rolling Stock Corp’s acquisition of the British semiconductor manufacturer Dynex through its subsidiary Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric in 2008 is another example. Paul Taylor, chief executive of Dynex, said the deal helped his team increase its research and development capabilities through financial support and technology sharing as well as its ability to commercialise its technology. Since the acquisition, Dynex has experienced two stages of technology expansions and gained access to skilled engineers from Zhuzhou CSR. “The fact they’ve been here and understand the way we work as a team also means they can help to co-ordinate the partnership with our parent company in the longer term,” Mr Taylor said. According to research by accounting firm Grant Thornton and China Daily, the 25 fastest-growing Chinese companies in Britain have generated 38 per cent growth overall, generating a combined turnover of more than £25 billion and employed about 4,000 people. • Find more fascinating articles at China Daily • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:40:13.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
