The activities include the distribution of recyclable bags made of nonwoven fabric by the laundry department, and providing reward to the staff with the most creative use of plastic alternative. The management also shared tips and information on how to reduce plastic consumption including a \"Bring Your Own Bag\" approach when shopping, and using mugs or metal tumblers instead of plastic bottles, among others. \nRamada Ajman will also conduct a consumption analysis report on plastic usage, alongside a waste audit, on how they were able to reduce the percentage of plastic products after the steps taken. On top of the \"Living Plastic Free\" drive, Ramada Hotel and Suites Ajman planted more trees in its urban farm, which can also aid in the goal of carbon footprint reduction. \n\nIftikhar Hamdani, General Manager, Ramada Hotel and Suites Ajman, \"We fully support Wyndham's Green initiatives, as our hotel has been very active in these types of activities over the past years.
