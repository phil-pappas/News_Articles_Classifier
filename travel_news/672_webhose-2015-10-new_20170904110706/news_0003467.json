In addition, the integration of public policies in support of innovation, the private sector and innovation centres is set to foster technology sectors. With a broad industrial and technological base, and increasingly looking to turn scientific knowledge into social and economic development, Brazil presents a set of incentives and a supportive environment for the research and development of new business solutions. Skilled labour, abundant natural resources and specific challenges in areas such as health, infrastructure, logistics, ICT and renewable energy and oil and gas, create opportunities that are already being explored by several global companies, who have recently launched R&D activities in Brazil. The Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade of Brazil (MDIC) and the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (Apex-Brasil) have developed a specific programme to attract international companies’ projects and R&D centres, with the goal of incorporating technological innovations, creating jobs and increasing the Brazilian productivity chain. The programme has identified oil and gas, health, renewable energy and ICT sectors as potential opportunities for foreign investors. At the Innovate in Brasil Seminar we will present international investors with an overview of the Brazilian innovation environment. The seminar takes place in London, on 29 October 2015 at the Jumeirah Carlton Tower. Innovation specialists; executives from international companies developing R&D in Brazil as well as representatives of Brazilian public institutions will take part. On the agenda , the debate will focus on topics including the business environment, government incentives, financing and production factors. Moreover, companies interested in investment opportunities in Brazil – in R&D or other sectors – will be able to meet with government representatives regarding projects in Brazil. I strongly encourage you to take a look at the programme and to register for what will be a stimulating and worthwhile morning. I look forward to welcoming you to our event in London. David Barioni Neto President of Apex-Brasil", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:28:33.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
