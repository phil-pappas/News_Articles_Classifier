Kandasamy among other senior officials.\nWith rain threatening to play spoilsport, the event's organisers — the Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) and the Chennai City Connect, had to hold off on a few events such as street art and painting competition.\nThe enthusiasm shown by children and parents in playing cricket, badminton and football on the wide open space on the promenade ensured that the initiative commenced on a successful note.\nEven as early as 5 am, the entry of vehicles to the promenade was restricted with around 80 traffic police personnel manning the barricades at six entry points. Preeti Aghalayam, president of Chennai Runners group, told DC that car free Sundays must expand to more pockets in the city. “People like us who are passionate about running would feel safe without cars and vehicles,” she said.\nYuvaraj Dorairaja, a resident of Velachery, who was at the venue with his family, welcomed the concept and said that the event needs to be publicised well. \"Obviously, the easiest way to do that is by word of mouth and then there is the media. Areas like Velachery and Anna Nagar should have car free days because there are a lot of senior citizens residing in these places, just like Besant Nagar, and they will all benefit and feel safe,\" he said.\nA Madurai native, Selvaraj, who was out visiting his relative, was enthused by what he saw on the promenade. “Madurai needs such an event. The corporation there has to come forward with the idea. It feels nice seeing people indulging in sports on the road,” he said. Shreya Gadepalli, regional director of ITDP, told DC that the ideal challenge would be to expand the car free concept to around a dozen locations in the city within a one year time frame. “But it should be a citizen driven concept. We need people who approach and tell us that they need a car free day in their area,” she said.\nShe added that holding a car free day on a massive scale requires more number of volunteers so that pressure on the traffic police personnel is reduced. Residents on the promenade who had expressed concern about the parking arrangements and also feared that the place would be littered beyond recognition, post the event, expressed surprise at the tidy way the event was held.\n“We are extremely happy that the traffic police helped prevent vehicles from being parked in front of our doorways. The event has been great and now the only thing to ensure is that it happens every Sunday” said Rajeshwari Arunachalam of the Elliots Beach Home Owners Welfare Association. “It was like Diwali today. They need to extend car free days to all around the city,” exalted K.R.
