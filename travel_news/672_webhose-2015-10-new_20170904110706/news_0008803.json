The dishes will be paired with specialty cocktails using Angostura 1919 rum, the brand famous for its Bitters. The twins, owners of the catering business “Twice the Spice” in Toronto, and their delicious dishes will be featured on the “I’ll be Host for the Holidays” stage at 1:00 pm on Friday, October 30, 2015 and on Sunday, November 1, 2015. Both events are free with a day pass to OWFF. \nAt the Trinidad and Tobago booth, Angostura House will sample its multiple award-winning Angostura 1919 rum on its own as well as in a sorrel rum punch by Ottawa-born chef Resa Solomon St. Lewis, who also has roots in Trinidad and Tobago. Sorrel is a specialty drink made from the sepals of the sorrel (roselle or hibiscus) plant and is served at Christmas time in Trinidad and Tobago. \nTobagonian chef and author of “Taste of Tobago Blue Food,” and Baking and Pastry Arts lecturer, Sonia Malika Phillip will also be present at this year’s Festival. \nVisitors to the Trinidad and Tobago booth are in for rhythmic treats courtesy the Mason Hall Folk Performers from Tobago and the Nepean Pan Harmonics, an Ottawa-based steel pan band.
