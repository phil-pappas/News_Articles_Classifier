The mix of attendees from yacht designers and shipyard personnel to captains and crew ensured a broad cross section of exposure for all marine product exhibitors. \n“The level of market confidence seemed reasonably buoyant with future expectations appearing positive,” says Global Superyacht Sales Manager of Muir Winches Stephen Vincent. “The weather was great and the levels of show attendance appeared consistent on each of the four days.” \nPutting Australia in the spotlight at the show was Australian boat builder Silver Yachts who were winners of the prestigious Finest New Yacht Award for their recent build Silver Fast. \nThe incredible superyacht is the world’s largest and fastest aluminum motor yacht with conventional propulsion, capable of speeds in excess of 27 knots and a cruising speed of up to 20 knots. \nLaunched earlier this year by Australia’s Silver Yachts (previously Hanseatic Marine), Silver Fast made the three-week journey from the shipyard in Australia to Monaco with only one fuel stop. This win provided an excellent focus towards the Australian superyacht industry. \nThe Australian contingent present at this year’s show included BSE Maritime Solutions, Muir Winches and VEEM, Abell Point Marina, Bray Management, Echo Yachts, Greencorp Marine, Ocean Alliance, Ocean Media, Rivergate Marina & Shipyard, Silveryachts, Silverstar Marine, Sevenstar Yacht Transport, Sorgiovanni Designs, Superior Jetties, Marine WA, Superyacht Queensland, Superyacht Group Great Barrier Reef and Superyacht Sydney. \nExhibitors from the Australian pavilion have all reported a successful show. \nInterest in refit businesses in Australia was significant with both Rivergate and BSE Maritime Solutions fielding a number of enquiries. BSE, who made their debut at this year’s show, were pleased with the shows outcomes. \n“The sheer scale of the show, with 121 superyachts and 350 exhibitors present, was at first a challenge in maximizing the opportunity of doing business with the global who’s who of the superyacht industry,” says BSE Business Development Manager Denis Maher. “But with the support of AIMEX and Superyacht Australia, and the other Australian companies present at the show, catching up with those most important quickly fell into place.” \nThe Australian companies present at this year’s show included several key superyacht agents who were on hand to explain the current charter regulations in Australia. \nSuperyacht Australia is excited by the new legislation currently in parliament and urge captains and owners to utilize the services of member agents who are totally across all aspects of the charter regulations and will simplify the process for visiting superyachts. \nAustralia’s presence on the global stage is set to be significant over the coming months with an Australian Pavilion also at the forthcoming Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show (Nov 5-9) and Marine Equipment Trade Show in Amsterdam (Nov 17-19).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:49:06.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
