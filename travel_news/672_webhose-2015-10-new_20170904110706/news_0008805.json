This year the U.S. is projected to account for 150 or more exhibitors â€” perhaps as much as 15% of the total projected, and the largest international contingent of exhibitors expected at the event. \nThe U.S. presence at Dubai, featuring such industry giants as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, is anchored by the 2,200-plus sqm (gross) U.S. International Pavilion organized by Kallman Worldwide, Inc. In coordination with numerous government agencies, including the U.S. Commercial Service, the Pavilion serves as a primary destination for buyers looking for an efficient way to meet U.S. companies, and an on-site business hub for U.S. exhibitors looking to maximize their exposure and impact at the event. \n\"When the U.S.A. commits to exhibit at the Dubai Airshow, we're saying we believe in the power of this event to attract real business prospects and customers. The steady growth and diversification of this show speaks for itself,\" said Kallman Worldwide President and CEO, Tom Kallman. \"As the organizer of the U.S International Pavilion, our team is proud to help our exhibitors capitalize on this international business event to grow their share of the regional marketplace, and further extend our nation's global aerospace and defense leadership.\" \nOf the 90-plus U.S. companies participating in the U.S. International Pavilion, more than 30 are affiliated with six state pavilions representing Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Virginia, New Hampshire and Washington. Ranging from publicly-traded stalwarts to privately-held innovators, Pavilion exhibitors represent a cross-section of leading American suppliers looking for new export opportunities and to strengthen regional business relationships.
