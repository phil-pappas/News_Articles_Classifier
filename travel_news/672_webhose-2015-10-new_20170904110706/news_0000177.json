From May 27 to June 21, 2016, the 2004-vintage ship will be dry docked for 25 days for the redesign, which encompasses cabins and restaurants. The new single staterooms will be in the higher-end Britannia Club room category, which offers occupants access to a dedicated restaurant, as well as nightly turndown service and 24-hour room service. The ship is best known for its trans-Atlantic crossings, and next summer, post-retrofit, those cruises start at $1,549 per person, double occupancy. NORWEGIAN PLANS A CHINESE SHIP Joining the rush to Asian waters, Norwegian Cruise Line has just announced it will launch its first ship custom-built for the Chinese market in spring 2017. The new 4,200-passenger ship, yet to be named, will belong in its new Breakaway Plus class, which will debut with next week’s launch of the Norwegian Escape. The company has not said where the ship’s home port in China will be. Other details are vague as well, though Norwegian plans to cater to Chinese cruisers with restaurants featuring Mandarin and Cantonese food as well as continental fare. A 40-DAY SAIL ON SALE Marking its 40th anniversary, the river cruise line CroisiEurope will run a unique 40-day trip through Europe, May 5 to June 15, 2016. Beginning in Spain and ending in Romania, the itinerary uses four ships to visit 12 countries including Portugal, France, Germany and Hungary, stringing together its most popular routes. Fares start at $10,900 per person, double occupancy. CRUISE PRICES ARE UP SLIGHTLY The Texas-based travel agency Cayole Cruises has recently begun publishing average cruise prices on its website, and its latest monthly report found that prices are trending up slightly, at .62 percent for all cruises compared with last year. By region, the results are more variable, with Panama cruises spiking at 17 percent up over last year and Europe down nearly 4.5 percent. The calculations reflect price averages of six major cruise lines including Carnival, Celebrity, Holland America, Norwegian, Princess and Royal Caribbean. “The prices are trending up because [the] global economy is growing and prices for cruises is slowly going up,” wrote Cayole president Ashot Hayrapetyan in an email. “Europe is not doing well economically and prices of European cruises are down.” Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:07:50.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
