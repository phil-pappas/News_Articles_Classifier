VTE is a leading cause of preventable death in hospitals worldwide - ahead of infection and pneumonia , according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Patient-Safety Program . [i] Culminating on 13 October and led by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, World Thrombosis Day (WTD) seeks to build awareness of thrombosis, the formation of blood clots and a condition that kills approximately 1 in 4 people around the world.[ii] Globally, an estimated 10 million cases of VTE occur annually.[iii] In Europe and the United States alone, more than 600,000 people die from VTE every year - more than the combined death toll from prostate and breast cancer, AIDS and motor vehicle crashes.[iv],[v] Currently, most health systems do not require hospitals to assess incoming patients for their risk of developing VTE, despite the fact that up to 60 percent of all VTE cases are hospital associated.[vi] When enforced, risk assessments have been associated with reductions of VTE-related deaths among hospital patients.[vii] \"A patient going into the hospital is at an increased risk for developing VTE, whether admitted for surgery or medical illness,\" said Gary Raskob , Ph.D., dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center , and chairman of the World Thrombosis Day Steering Committee. \"People need to know that hospitalization is a leading risk factor for VTE, and hospitals owe it to their patients to be vigilant about performing VTE risk assessments on every patient. The results of that assessment should be used to decide about the use of evidence-based preventive measures against VTE.\"Only 25 percent of adults around the world think that hospitalization is a risk factor for VTE, according to a nine-nation survey conducted by global polling firm Ipsos for the ISTH and published earlier this year in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis .[viii] The survey queried 7,233 participants and was the largest international survey of its kind. In addition to issuing the hospital and health system mandate call-to-action, efforts during WTD will focus on public education and urging people going into the hospital to proactively ask for a VTE risk assessment. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:16:52.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
