VPC \nPHILADELPHIA – The US Airways name went out with a sentimental bang in the wee hours of Saturday morning. \nFlight 1939, the last-ever to fly under the US Airways name, left San Francisco a little after 10 p.m. PT Friday evening. It touched down in Philadelphia on Saturday morning at about 5:50 a.m. ET, sending the US Airways brand into the aviation history books alongside names like Pan Am, Braniff and TWA. \nThe farewell flight was packed with both employees and long-time US Airways customers as well as a number of aviation enthusiasts. All said they couldn’t pass up the chance to “witness history.” USA TODAY US Airways’ final flight closes curtain on another major airline USA TODAY Era of airline merger mania comes to a close with last US Airways flight \nOnboard, champagne flowed in a toast to the airline — along with tears and tales of US Airways’ past. The flight’s first two hours had a party atmosphere, though things finally calmed down around midnight PT as passengers began to nod-off on the 5-hour cross-country “red-eye” flight. \nOn arrival to Philadelphia, a crowd of perhaps 100 or more well-wishers roared with applause as passengers left the plane just after 6 a.m. \nJoe and Carol Kalista of Barnesville, Pa., were among those who made a special trip to California just to be on the final flight to Philadelphia. \nLast Slide Next Slide \nJoe learned in July that the Oct. 16 flight would end up becoming the last to fly for US Airways. “I called immediately and I was able to get on,” he says. \nKalista says he’s been a loyal customer for nearly four decades, going back to the company’s days as Allegheny Air. Now retired, Kalista says he flew up to six flights a week on the airline – mostly out of Allentown and Harrisburg Pa. – during his days as an executive for an engineering firm. \n“Something is going away that’s part of my life … USAir, US Airways and Allegheny,” Kalista says. “That’s why I booked it.” AZCENTRAL US Airways passengers, employees bid airline adieu \nHelena Valentine (left), a retired employee who spent 35 years with US Airways, becomes emotional while talking to former CEO Ed Colodny prior to the airline’s last ever departure from San Francisco on Oct. 16, 2015. (Photo: Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY) \nBefore the flight left San Francisco, the Kalistas joined a rambunctious-but-good-spirited crowd that had gathered at Gate 45A to witness US Airways’ final departure. \nThe biggest cheers were reserved for Ed Colodny, who was CEO of the company from 1975 through 1991. He led the 1979 rebranding from Allegheny Air to USAir amidst a broad expansion. He also helped engineer the 1980s mergers with Piedmont and Pacific Southwest. Colodny is remembered affectionately by many employees as “Uncle Ed” for the close relationship he cultivated with workers. \nApplause and cries of “we love you Ed!” filled the gate area as the former CEO emerged from Gate 45A after arriving on Flight 1939’s Phoenix-to-San Francisco leg. \nHelena Valentine of Carnegie, Pa.., was among a throng of people vying for Colodny’s attention before Flight 1939 continued on from San Francisco for its final leg to Philadelphia. Now retired, Valentine worked for the company for 35 years, starting in reservations in Syracuse for Allegheny Air back in 1973. \nShe broke down in tears as she talked with Colodny Friday evening at the gate, where she had brought a copy of the first company newsletter after the switch to the USAir name in 1979. Valentine hoped Colodny might sign it, which he happily did. \nLast Slide Next Slide \n“He told us that people like us made the company great,” Valentine said in explaining Colodny’s appeal to employees that worked under him. “He was a great man to work for.” \nGlenda Yerse of Phoenix also was on hand in San Francisco. A retired flight attendant, she had just flown in on Phoenix-San Francisco leg of Flight 1939. She dressed for the occasion, donning her Allegheny Airlines flight attendant uniform from the 1970s. \n“I never thought I’d get the opportunity to wear it again, but here I am,” she said Friday night in San Francisco. \nLike the others, she came to witness the history of US Airways’ final flight. She wasn’t taking the last leg to Philadelphia, but was pleased to be part of the spectacle. \n“I’m surprised at such a big turnout,” she said about the large crowd and party atmosphere at the gate. “I’m just happy to be part of this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:13:58.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
