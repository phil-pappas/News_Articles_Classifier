Orlando, FL, October 11, 2015 --( PR.com )-- The combination of a pencil beam and uniform scanning to increase the precision of radiation and, thereby, reduce damage to nearby healthy tissue is advancing the treatment of cancer at the Provision Center for Proton Therapy, a recipient of the Medical Tourism Cancer Center Leader of the Year Award, the Medical Tourism Association announced today.“For years patients facing cancer had very few options to combat not only their condition, but the severe side effects that resulted from their treatments,” said Renée-Marie Stephano, president of the Medical Tourism Association®, at an awards ceremony during the 8th World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 27-30, 2015, in Orlando, Fla. “That’s no longer the truth. Provision has placed great emphasis on patient compassion and sensitivity and that, combined with exceptional success rates, have pushed proton therapy into the mainstream as a highly effective means for treating cancer.”The Provision Center for Proton Therapy is the first of its kind in Tennessee and only the second in the Southeast United States to offer proton therapy, considered one of the most advanced cancer treatments in the world. Like conventional treatment, proton therapy directs radiation into the tumor site where doses of destroy cancerous cells. However, unlike conventional radiation therapy, in which x-ray beams deposit their energy into the healthy tissue before and after the tumor site, physicians can control the timing and dosage of energy from protons, which allows the maximum energy deposited directly into the tumor, reducing damage to nearby healthy tissue and, thus, limiting negative side effects.Only one of 14 cancer centers in the United States treat cancer with proton therapy; yet, 99 percent of men are living cancer-free and with excellent quality of life, five years after proton therapy treatment for prostate cancer. However, doctors at the Provision Center for Proton Therapy also treat cancers of the brain, breast, lung, pancreas, head and neck as well as pediatric, Hodgkin lymphoma and sarcoma conditions.The World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress accepts nominations to honor leadership, innovation, education, service and top facilities and destinations in the care and treatment of both international- and domestic-traveling patients.Stakeholders who make up the billion-dollar medical tourism industry are encouraged to forward news of tremendous performances that recognize customer-focused care, international quality and standards, patient safety and satisfaction, effective leadership and state-of-the-art technology within the calendar year 2015-2016.
