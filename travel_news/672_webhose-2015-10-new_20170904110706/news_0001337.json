After all, to most outsiders, Whanganui is known for three things - its floods, Michael Laws, and its 'H' debate. \nBut repairs have been underway since the devastating June floods and the region is expected to be back to normal by the summer season. Michael Laws, the outspoken former mayor, moved to Timaru. And the 'H' debate is set to come to a conclusion, after the New Zealand Geographic Board decided the letter should be included in the district's official name. The final call now lies with Land Information Minister Louise Upston, who is expected to make her decision by the end of the year. \"We market Whanganui with the 'h' anyway,\" says Main. \"It's the name of the river, it's the name of the park. It's one step to go.\" READ MORE:* Wet and wild on the Whanganui The name change comes as part of an overall renaissance for Whanganui, which, Main says, is putting the focus back on the river. \nThe Big Orange cafe, with a view of the Watt Fountain, is a picture-perfect location for lunch. Image: Visit Whanganu \nBy that, she means two things - the more obvious adventurous pursuits, such as canoeing, jetboating and the National Park. But also the thriving arts and foodie culture that has built up around the river. \n\"Down towards the river there's a lot of studios, galleries and opportunities for people to engage with the working artists.\" The jewel in the crown of Whanganui's art scene, the Sarjeant Gallery, is currently located on the quay while its historic building in Queens Park undergoes earthquake strengthening over the next few years. With a collection of more than 6000 pieces, it is recognised as one of New Zealand's best regional galleries, and is the perfect place to spend a quiet morning before checking out one of the nearby cafes for lunch. \nMain is hesitant to name favourites - \"it's a bit hard when you're the mayor\" - but says Mud Ducks and Recaffeinate deserve special mentions for their great coffee and riverside locations. Just up the road on the main street is the iconic Big Orange cafe, located in a historic renovated post office. \n\"It's a very photographed corner.\" \nIf you're coming for the weekend, Main says, checking out the Saturday markets is a must. There are two of them, located on the banks of the river - together they are known as the Whanganui River Traders and Farmers Market. Main, who was involved in establishing the River Traders market a decade ago, says half of the market is dedicated to the region's arts and craftspeople, while the other half focuses on the farmers and producers. With 50 to 100 stalls every weekend, rain or shine, there is something for everyone. \nThe Cemetery Circuit is a legendary event. Image Visit Whanganu \nShe also suggests timing a trip to fit in with some of the major events on the Whanganui calendar. On Boxing Day, the town will be filled with the roar of engines for the famous Cemetery Circuit motorcycle races. \n\"That is a legend of an event,\" Main says. \n\"It's hot, dusty, noisy, lots of people sitting around drinking cold beer watching the races. It's a great day whether you're a biking fan or not.\" \nIf pretty dresses and nostalgia are more your thing, perhaps consider Whanganui's Vintage Weekend, held over Wellington Anniversary Weekend. The heritage event features retro music, market shopping, fashion and even a vintage bathing suit competition. \nFor families, Main recommends a visit to the Whanganui Regional Museum - a place that often falls under the radar of many visitors. \"People think, 'oh, I'm not going to look at a museum'. But we've got a fantastic moa exhibition there - the best in the world. We've got a full skeleton, we've got thousands and thousands of moa bones. Kids find it absolutely fascinating.\" \nVisitors to Whanganui will find they will be received with a warm welcome, Main says. \"It's not unusual to be taken to a local's home for dinner, or to chat to people in the cafe. It is the people that make it here.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:01:37.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
