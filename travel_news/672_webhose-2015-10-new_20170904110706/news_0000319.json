Lake Winnipesaukee is a bucolic, serene, and truly happy haven where life's worries evaporate in the fresh air (no need for air-conditioning). For the last 18 years, we have visited this New Hampshire wonderland, as well as the White Mountains and Lake Ossipee region.\nThis summer's two-week vacation combined the best of every experience we've had on Winnipesaukee. Our three-bedroom, two-bath lakefront cottage in Tuftonboro's Melvin Village was the best rental house yet. Its 8-foot-wide wraparound porch became the dining, resting, and reading place. The renovated kitchen allowed six of us family members to dine in in comfort. So what if there was no dishwasher? We had low-maintenance meals, and several meals out, that kept dishwashing to a minimum.\nThe 40-foot dock was our living room on this crystal-clear lake. Our 20-foot Four Winns powerboat, which we trailered to New Hampshire, was docked just steps from the house. Over the years, we've visited many parts of Winnipesaukee, 21 miles long and 9 miles wide, with 244 islands and 182 miles of shoreline.\nThe eastern side of the lake has drawn us over the last few years. The main town, Wolfeboro, is less than a 20-minute drive away and is quintessential New England: the Main Street mom-and-pop shops and restaurants (no Starbucks); Town Docks, where you can boat from your house and dock to get ice cream at Bailey's Bubble (low-fat Mint Patty yogurt, my favorite); a terrific gym, Olympic Gym & Fitness, where you can work out as much as you want for two weeks for $35 (or $5 per visit).\nOn the lake, we ventured to Ragged Island twice. You anchor close to shore, and children swim in a sandy-bottomed, roped-off area, or out to rocks that jut above the surface. The Lakes Region Conservation Trust maintains this tiny gem, which has a dock and short walking trail with signs marking plants and flora, and wild blueberries bursting with flavor.\nMy adventurous husband encouraged me to try a hike along part of Rattlesnake Island, visible from Wolfeboro and many spots along the eastern side of the lake. We boated to this distinctive-looking, 2-mile-long island that rises 900 feet at its highest peak. After docking, we hiked up the rocky trail to enjoy breathtaking views of the lake.\nOther enjoyable family hikes - accessible by land - include Mount Major and Red Hill. The Abenaki Tower in Tuftonboro offers the shortest, easiest hike, with eye-popping 180-degree views of Winnipesaukee and the Ossipee Mountains.\nTwo weeks is becoming too short for this vacation destination. From visiting High Meadows Farm (with its horseback-riding class) and the abundant farmers' markets to enjoying countless day and night trips exploring Lake Winnipesaukee, this happy place is tops for a family getaway. But, please, don't tell anyone.\nBrenda Jorett writes from Cherry Hill.\nDid a travel experience move you, change you, or give you great memories?
