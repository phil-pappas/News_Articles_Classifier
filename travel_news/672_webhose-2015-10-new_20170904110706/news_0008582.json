The Rickey, a brand new concept, is a cultured craft cocktail bar with a lively social scene. The two new spaces will have distinct personalities and offer guests innovative, curated experiences within the bustling Midtown neighborhood.\n\"I am very excited about these two new venues and the extension of the successful PHD Downtown property that we opened over six years ago,\" says Vikram Chatwal .\nNoah Tepperberg says, \"Over the years of both work and personal friendship we are looking forward to continuing to grow and operate venues within the Dream Hotel brand with Vikram.\"\nPHD Terrace, housed in the restored 1895 Beaux-Arts building that is the original Dream hotel, marks the second PHD rooftop lounge location in Manhattan . Midtown's newest hotspot will offer neighbors and visitors alike a wide variety of vibrant experiences from after-work happy hour to a weekend night out on the town. Similar to its downtown outpost, PHD Terrace will be a nightlife destination with rotating DJs, weekly parties and exclusive events.\nLocated on the 15 th and 16 th floors, PHD Terrace is designed for partygoers to flow between the outdoor deck and the indoor lounge, both boasting spectacular skyline views of Midtown Manhattan, home to some of the city's most iconic buildings.\nDesigner Josh Held , whose distinguished past projects include LIGHT Las Vegas , Voyeur Los Angeles, Marquee New York and The Lobby Lounge and Guest House at Dream Downtown, collaborated with the Dream Midtown team to execute the design of PHD Terrace. Inspired by a luxe penthouse apartment, the leading-edge lounge focuses on green, gold and rich wood tones. Guests will enter the space via a dedicated elevator and proceed down a hallway with ivy vines draped within metal slats on one wall and bark with gold leaf on the other, leading to the indoor lounge.\nBrown leather banquettes and mirrored tables line the window wall of the PHD terrace's indoor area. Mirrored light fixtures are on the wall adjacent to the windows and three large, modern-sculptural chandeliers hang above. The indoor bar adjacent to the entrance - which features three-dimensional, custom gold ceramic tile - is designed to resemble a kitchen island as a nod to the space's luxurious penthouse theme. Behind the bar stands a large, rectangular window with earth-tone marble on each side. During warmer months, the window will open to the outdoor space, allowing guests to order cocktails without leaving the spectacular terrace.\nLocated just up the stairs on the second level lies an additional outdoor deck featuring oversized parquet flooring, wood banquets and concrete tables akin to an amplified penthouse patio. Fashioned with custom green, red and off-white ceramic tiles, the extensive outdoor bar offers guests yet another area to imbibe al fresco. Green potted plants and hanging ivy vines permeate the space for a homey, garden-like ambience.\nWhile posted high above the city, guests of PHD Terrace can expect an innovative drink list and light bites. Specialty cocktail highlights include offerings made popular by the downtown location such as the Hot to Trot (Cazadores Tequila Blanco, cucumber, agave, jalapeno) and Wet Dream (Grey Goose Cherry Noir, white cranberry & pineapple juice, St. Germain), among others. Selections from the new dining offerings include Crunchy Orzo & Cheese Balls, Duck Confit Spring Rolls, Prosciutto, Fig & Gorgonzola Flatbread and Buttermilk Fried Chicken Waffle Tacos.\nHours of operation are 4pm until late, seven days a week. For more information or reservations, please visit phdterrace.com or call 646-756-2044.\nThe Rickey will exemplify an energetic and inviting craft cocktail lounge, with an unconventional cocktail menu and a sophisticated-yet-accessible wine program. Aptly named after the classic cocktail, The Rickey will feature four versions of the drink, including one that will be a nod to Colonel Joe Rickey , who is said to be the drink's namesake. A prominent lobbyist in D.C., Colonel Rickey regularly closed deals over drinks; many consider him the first to introduce fresh-squeezed lime in his signature Bourbon and Seltzer cocktail, which may have sweetened his deals. Playing off the history of the drink, The Rickey is the perfect place for guests to indulge in an after-work craft cocktail or business meeting drinks the same way that the Colonel did years ago, but now with a modern twist. The Rickey's craft cocktails offer an inspired spin on classic cocktails, leaving guests with a unique balance of satisfaction and intrigue.\nThe Rickey's design is inspired by the early 1900s, in celebration of the era when the cocktail namesake first appeared in Daly's Bartenders' Encyclopedia in 1903. The bar's furnishings and subtle design details are all one of a kind. Handpicked lamps, created by the self-proclaimed \"Steampunk Illuminist\" Terry Peikin , are made out of brass and copper with vintage pressure gauges, Edison bulbs and perforated diffusers. These functional works of art will be placed on the tables throughout the space. Guests can enjoy their drinks while lounging on plush velvet sofas, chairs and barstools. Hidden in the back corner of the intimate, dimly lit lounge will stand an unsuspecting DJ booth, allowing for the true focal point to be the hand-crafted, wrap-around marble bar, which commands the room.\nConceptualized by acclaimed mixologist Johnny Swet (JIMMY at The James, The Skylark, Rogue & Canon, Cafe Clover), the eccentric specialty craft cocktails menu will feature only fresh ingredients delivered to the venue daily - a true farm-to-bar experience, with a rotating offering for guests to play around with flavors and tastes while highlighting seasonal produce. Nightly visitors will be privy to an \"ingredients index\" written on a grandiose mirror alongside the bar.\nStaying true to its name, the cocktail menu will include a separate Rickey cocktail section featuring two classic and two seasonal Rickeys. The Pomegranate Rickey (vodka, PAMA pomegranate-flavored liqueur, pomegranate seed ice, ginger beer, lime) is designed to be the seasonal standout, while the refreshing Gin Rickey (gin, fresh lime, simple syrup and seltzer) will satisfy guests who prefer a classic cocktail.\nAdditional highlights include innovative cocktails with inventive and often-surprising ingredients, such as The Cartel (Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum, pineapple syrup, a block of coconut water ice, topped with grated Colombian coffee bean); Bourgeois Pig (Chopin Single Potato Vodka, dry vermouth, bacon elixir, rosemary bitters, freshly shaved black truffle), and the Jerry Lee Lewis, a deconstructed, modern version of the Fireball (12-year bourbon, Ancho Reyes chili liqueur, topped with cinnamon and served over an ice sphere).\nKeeping with the crafted nature of the cocktail menu, The Rickey will also offer a wine list hand-selected by Managing Partner Matt Strauss, which boasts favorites from his personal discoveries over the past 10 years. Every bottle of wine on The Rickey menu will be offered by the glass, giving guests a chance to discover new wines and indulge in old favorites. The passionate staff will be able to walk guests through each bottle of wine on the menu, and tailor selections geared to excite wine experts and novices alike.\nIn addition to the wines on the menu, multiple bottles consisting of some of the great wine treasures, such as first growth Bordeaux and California cult wines, will be available in 3-ounce and 6-ounce pours using the Coravin system. A light food selection of cheeses and charcuteries will shortly follow the opening on October 1 . The menu will include at least one suggested wine and one craft cocktail to pair with each dish.\nFor more information or reservations, please visit www.TheRickey.com or call 646-759-2054. The Rickey will be open daily starting at 4 p.m.\nABOUT VIKRAM CHATWAL\nSince opening his first hotel in 1999, Vikram Chatwal has redefined the essence of high-end boutique hotels through his design-driven, luxury approach.
