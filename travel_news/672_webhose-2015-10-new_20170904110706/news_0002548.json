Vines grow on the sunny slopes of Central Bohemia and South Moravia that produce premium wine every year. Head to the traditional autumn wine festivals or a few cozy wine cellars for a taste of the Czech Republic. \nČeský Krumlov 2015 Wine Festival \nFine Czech and international wines, local culinary specialties and face to face meetings with wine experts. This is the Český Krumlov Wine Festival, which will be held from 30 October to 29 November. You can look forward to the opening ceremony, including the planting of a new vineyard, which takes place on 6 November. Five days later, on 11 November at exactly 11 minutes after 11 o’clock in the morning, the first bottle of St. Martin’s wine will be opened – the first wine from this year’s harvest with its typical light fruity taste, which you can use to toast the tradition of the Feast of Saint Martin on 11 November. These wines mature in just a few weeks, but it’s enough time to develop their own individual character. The Castle Wine Festival, which take places on 21 November, offers you a unique opportunity to taste various Czech and foreign wines in the charming scenery of Český Krumlov Castle. Take some time to walk through the labyrinth of streets of Český Krumlov so that you don’t miss a unique opportunity to experience one of the 12 Czech sites included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. \nSt. Martin’s Mikulov \nThe city of wine, Mikulov in South Moravia, is again hosting a wine festival.

Children will have a field day with all the theatrical fairy tales and historical performances being prepared for them. On 11 November St. Martin himself will arrive at the festival on his white horse (according to legend, his arrival on a white horse symbolizes the first snow and the coming of winter) and take part in the ceremonial opening of the first St. Martin’s wines. You can also attend the Sanctification of Wine, which will be held on 13 November at Mikulov Château. In addition to blessing the young wines, the program will offer fresh samples to taste. \nSt. Martin’s degustation in Brno \nWine lovers traditionally gather on Freedom Square in Brno on St. Martin’s Day to try the first wines of the year.

You can stop at 19 points with trilingual information panels that explain more about the Valtice vineyards and the everyday working life of the winemakers.
