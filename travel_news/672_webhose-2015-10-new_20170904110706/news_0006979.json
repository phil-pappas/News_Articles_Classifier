Our integrated campaign, ‘We’ve got the whole package’, designed by Dublin-based agency, Principle, used a visual and creative approach to deliver key messages to our audience of UK and European buyers, and was integrated across all our activity, with print and online advertising complemented by direct and digital marketing.”\n \nThe annual awards, which were held at the QEII Centre in London last Friday 9th October, were launched in 2002 by Meetings & Incentive Travel magazine, to raise the standards of marketing in the meetings and events industry and to recognise best practice in marketing.\n \nThe CCD has now received 31 industry awards in just over five years, including eight MIMAs for international marketing campaigns. Last month, the venue also won ‘Best Overseas Conference Venue’ at the UK C&IT Excellence Awards.\n \nThere were a number of other Irish winners on the night, including Fáilte Ireland who won silver for ‘Best Use of Video Marketing’, and Croke Park who won bronze for ‘Best Social Media Campaign’.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:41:41.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
