But now, more than 50 years later, new leads are being presented by the Anglin family, who are cooperating with authorities for the first time. \nThey claim that not only did the brothers survive the escape, they were alive and well up through at least the mid-1970s — and may still be alive today.

Source: News Limited \nThe evidence is offered up by the Anglins’ nephews David, 48, and Ken Widner, 54, who are featured in Alcatraz: Search for the Truth , a History Channel special about to air in the US. The evidence has pumped life into the cold case, and has investigators lining up new interviews and planning to search South America for signs of America’s most notorious escapees. \n“This is absolutely the best actionable lead we’ve had,” Art Roderick, the retired US marshal who was lead investigator on the case for 20 years, tells The Post .

Dive into Breaking HISTORY's look at #Alcatraz , Monday at 8/7c. https://t.co/IjKfNhX8a7 — HISTORY (@HISTORY) October 10, 2015 \nThe Anglin family sat on those leads for years because, they say, they were spied on and harassed by the FBI for years. But a desire to see the case solved before Marie Anglin Widner — the Winners’ mother and the escapees’ sister — passed away, combined with the cockiness of Alcatraz officials, inspired them to come forward. \n“[Alcatraz officials] were not willing to ... say, ‘Maybe [the escapees] did make it’, ” David Widner says. “That gave me the motive to prove them wrong.” The card. Picture: History Channel Source: Supplied \nFirst there were the Christmas cards, signed with Clarence and John Anglin’s names, that were delivered to their mother during the three years after the escape. They arrived without postage. \nIn the History Channel special, the nephews take the cards and other evidence to Roderick, who retired in 2008 but is still working on the case. Though the handwriting matched, the investigators were unable to pinpoint the exact date of the cards. Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers dug through the walls in their cells into this hallway. They then perpetrated the only successful escape from Alcatraz.

That really caught Roderick’s attention. \n“When you work these types of cases there’s a feeling you get when stuff starts to fall into place,” he says. “I’m getting this feeling now.” \nThe next big piece of evidence was buried — about two metres in the ground. The family finally let investigators dig up the remains of the Anglins’ other brother, Alfred, who was electrocuted during his own escape attempt from an Alabama prison. They needed his DNA: Authorities had discovered a set of bones that washed ashore north of San Francisco in 1963, which they said may have belonged to one of the escapees. The Anglin brothers.

(The bones could still belong to Morris, though; he has no living relatives to test.) \nDavid Widner says he’s working on a book that will contain more evidence not included in the TV show. That includes a surprise guest star: Boston crime boss Whitey Bulger, who met the future escapees in Alcatraz. Bulger, in a 2014 letter to Ken Widner, said he instructed John and Clarence on how to navigate bay currents, and dropped a key piece of advice about being a fugitive. \n“He taught them that when you disappear, you have to cut all ties,” Ken says. “He told me in a letter, ‘This is the mistake that I made.’ He told me, ‘These brothers undoubtedly had done exactly what I told them to do.’” The atch tower overlooking the dock.

If they are still alive (both would be in their mid-80s by now), international laws may not even allow extradition to the US. \nNonetheless, Roderick would want to sit down with them to figure out how they did it. \nIf they died and their bodies can be found, however, Ken and David want to bring the Anglin brothers back to the family plot in Ruskin, Fla. \nSays David, “We should get ’em a place ready.” \nThis story originally appeared on the NYPost .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:45:38.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
