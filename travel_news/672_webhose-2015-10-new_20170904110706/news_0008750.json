The study, conducted by the Perryman Group, also said DFW supports 228,000 jobs in the area with an associated payroll of $12.5 billion annually, a significant increase over the figures calculated in a study two years ago. \n\"Our economic impact can't be measured alone in jobs, it must also be measured in the economic impact it has on so many other businesses in our area including the success and growth of small, minority and women-owned businesses,\" said Donohue. \"At DFW International Airport, we are proud that we have played a part in helping the Dallas Fort Worth area grow to one that is now home to 21 Fortune 500 companies, including American Airlines.\" \nDonohue delivered the news during his State of the Airport address outlining his vision for the future of DFW, which includes strategic planning for future expansion, more effectively telling the DFW story to the world and enhancing the customer experience. At the event, Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas and Mayor Betsy Price of Fort Worth also held an open dialogue on the potential for international expansion and opportunities for the community, while DFW Airport Board Chair Lillie Biggins introduced the hundreds of community leaders in attendance to DFW's new brand. \nWith regards to expansion, Donohue pledged DFW Airport would continue to aggressively market itself globally to bring new airline service from major international destinations and position DFW and the region on the international stage. DFW has already succeeded in attracting airline service to 57 international destinations, with 17 of those arriving in just the past five years. \n\"To build the airport of the future, we must start to think strategically how and where to expand our operations,\" said Donohue. \"We already know that much of our future growth will come from international travel.\" \n\"DFW Airport has played a major role in the ongoing economic success, of the Dallas Fort Worth region,\" said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings. \"Our region's growth rate far outpaces the U.S. average population growth since 2011, and we are continuing to see new businesses expand here.\" \n\"While we have seen a tremendous expansion of international flights at DFW, we see a great opportunity as a region to win even more on the global stage,\" said Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price. \"The ability to connect the DFW area to international commerce and tourism will keep our region strong and growing.\" \n\"DFW Airport is our gateway to the world,\" said Airport Board Chair Lillie Biggins. \"It makes our world just a little bit smaller and allows us to learn and appreciate new cultures and traditions, to expand new horizons, and to embark on a journey that will leave an impression on us forever.\" \nDonohue said the new DFW brand unveiled two weeks ago will serve as a central component in communicating DFW's story to the world more frequently and more richly. Over the last five years DFW has conducted about a dozen air service development missions to promote new air service and support existing service to places including China, South America, the Middle East and Australia. \n\"Working together, we can build on our success, we can continue to expand the North Texas economy, achieve new goals and reach new heights around the country and around the world,\" said Donohue. The Airport CEO also reported that DFW has become the first U.S. airport to achieve a Level Three certification under the Airport Carbon Accreditation program for successfully reducing carbon emissions and engaging local partners to do the same. \n\"This certifies our leadership as an airport that takes care of the environment even as we take care of business,\" said Donohue. \nDonohue also revealed that the United States Patent Office today has issued DFW Airport its first ever patent for the development of \"interactive information display\" technology that allows customers to use touch screens to find their way to restaurants, shops and services in the terminals. \nAs a key factor in improving the experience for DFW customers, Donohue referenced the ongoing $2.7 billion dollar Terminal Renewal and Improvement Program (TRIP) project to renew DFW's four original terminals, now more than halfway complete, along with the addition of compelling amenities such as the new duty-free shopping facilities scheduled to open in Terminal D next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:33:53.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
