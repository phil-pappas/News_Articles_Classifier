Located at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas , the 2015 JD Power Automotive Marketing Roundtable is the industry's leading marketing event with over 1,400 participants representing every facet of the automotive marketing profession. Covering information deemed important to explore in today's automotive environment, the event will present topics such as media mix and targeting strategies, cross-tier marketing, advertising platforms, industry trends and issues, and more.\nDMEa's breakthrough digital method utilizes first-party and other data so brand dealers can better reach customers with specific, targeted messages in the digital spaces they visit most. As it addresses an increasing service interval and the bleed of customers to aftermarket service providers, the DMEa technology enables dealers to increase lucrative revenue from their customers while deepening the relationship throughout the life of customers' car ownership and into subsequent brand-loyal car purchases.\n\"Service is incredibly profitable for OEMs and their dealerships, and a loyal service customer becomes a loyal customer to the brand. Too many customers are leaving their new car dealer for service from the aftermarket or other providers,\" said Mike Walther , Managing Director of DMEautomotive. \"We have to reach customers through the digital channels they interact with all the time. And with this technology we are able to expand targeted owner communication beyond traditional channels, pinpoint key service prospects, then target these owner segments specifically with digital display advertising, adding DMEa's loyalty segmentation to optimize targeting and timing. Through this process, we found that targeting digitally resulted in tremendous growth for dealers, welcoming a brighter future for dealership service marketing.\"\nUsing the vehicle ownership cycle as a measuring tool, DMEa found that targeting owners through new digital channels increased service sales by 30%, drove incremental service revenue back to the brand dealer, maximized reach and ROI, garnered actionable intelligence about dealers' most lucrative customers, and kept the customer conversation and personal relationship strong throughout.\nThe presentation, \"Scale Your Business Profitably by Taking Digital Data and Retail Marketing Beyond New Vehicle Acquisition,\" will take place at 11:45 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st at the 2015 JD Power Automotive Marketing Roundtable.\nAbout DMEautomotive\nDMEautomotive (DMEa), a Solera Holdings Inc. company, is the industry leader in science-based, results-driven automotive marketing, and provides turnkey marketing to the largest and most innovative automotive organizations, from automobile dealerships to many of the largest aftermarket companies in the U.S. DMEa's uniquely panoramic view of the complete automotive sales and service market, combined with its cutting-edge, science-based marketing programs, increases customer yield, conversion and retention.
