Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference. Jim Rowe (Director of IR): Thank you, [Regina] and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO John Stumpf and our CFO John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf (Chairman and CEO): Thank you, Jim, and thank you, good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We earned $5.8 billion in the third quarter as our diversified business model generated growth in revenue, loans, deposits, and net income compared with a year ago. We remain focused on meeting the financial needs of our customers and investing in businesses so we may continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers in the future. The strength of our franchise also positioned us well for the acquisitions we have recently announced. We are excited that the transactions with GE Capital will enable us to deepen relationships and increase our presence in commercial businesses that serve the real economy. General Electric , like Wells Fargo , is one of America's great companies, and the businesses we are acquiring are industry leaders with proven business models and exceptionally talented and experienced people. We are excited to have them join the Wells Fargo team. John Shrewsberry will provide more details on the recent GE Capital announcements at the end of the call. Let me now highlight our results this quarter compared with a year ago. We earned $1.05 in earnings per share, up 3% from a year ago. We generated $21.9 billion of revenue, up 3% with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. We grew pretax, pre-provision profit by 6%. We continued to have broad-based loan growth, with total loans reaching a record $903.2 billion. This is a bit larger than the size of our loan portfolio at the time of the Wachovia merger at the end of 2008. However, the quality of our current portfolio is significantly better than at the time of the merger. Our core loan portfolio increased by $73.4 billion, or 9% from a year ago, reflecting both strong organic growth and the benefit of the acquisitions we've completed over the past year. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth, with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion, up $71.6 billion or 6% from a year ago. And we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.8%. Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation, and returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority. Our dividend payout ratio is 35%, and we repurchased 52 million shares of common stock in the third quarter. 1 of 13", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:52:54.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
