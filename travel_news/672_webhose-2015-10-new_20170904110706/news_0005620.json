On Tuesday, Singh called for calm.\n“Throughout the years, this civilisation celebrated diversity, promoted and advocated tolerance,” said Mukherjee, a constitutional figurehead with a largely ceremonial role. “We cannot allow the core values of our civilisation to be wasted.”\nModi has been criticized for not publicly commenting on the controversy, but seven days after the murder, the home ministry said perpetrators of violence would be punished.\nAuthor Nayantara Sehgal, the niece of the first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, on Tuesday returned a 1986 prize she had received from India’s national academy of letters, to protest against what she called the rising dominance and intolerance of Hindu nationalism.\nFormer foreign secretary Shyam Saran also weighed in, with an article saying the lynching and other incidents were worrying signs that the “idea of India” was diminishing.\nThis week, in Delhi and the southern state of Kerala, where beef is widely eaten, groups of young people held beef-eating “picnics” to protest against the imposition of food prohibitions.\nModi’s government has clamped down on the illegal trade of cattle with Muslim-majority neighbour Bangladesh, and two states ruled by his party have tightened laws to protect cows.\nFirst Published on October 07, 2015 10:35 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:48:26.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
