For some, the attraction is presumably the prospect of a little peace and quiet, perhaps the solitude of a lorry cab. But many others are seeking travel, thrills and an element of danger… and there are plenty of jobs out there that can fulfil those criteria. Personally, I think that the hardest driving job in the world, purely from the point of remaining mentally engaged, must have been that of the coach driver on the “internationally recognised” M25 sightseeing tour that ran until 2012. I’m told junction eight was the best bit. Other jobs pose different challenges. Take for example Wing Commander Andy Green, below, whose job is to break the land speed record that he already holds. Next year, on a patch of South African desert, Green will be piloting the supersonic car Bloodhound SSC, which is powered by a jet engine and a rocket, to over 1,000mph. Green calls Bloodhound his “holiday job”. It’s not quite a Jaguar: Andy Green and a model of the supersonic Bloodhound SSC No less tough is the job of Top Fuel dragster driver. There’s a man at Santa Pod raceway, in Northamptonshire, whose job it is to give passenger rides. A ride only lasts seven seconds, which is how long it takes him to get down a quarter-­mile strip and hit 170mph before deploying a parachute to slow (and risking a detached retina from the negative G-force). But he does it again and again, encountering forces of 3.5G while essentially sitting in a shopping trolley with 1,000bhp strapped to his back. To race in three-hour stints at speeds that reach 200mph, is barkingly insane. To do it at 3am, in the pitch black, is something else again At the other end of the scale is a job that, at its most dangerous, involves the drivers going at about 5mph. Yes, it’s the ice road truckers, made famous by the reality TV programme of the same name. In the remote American and Canadian territories they regularly drive their heavy loads over frozen lakes, the ice cracking as they go, slowing for trucks coming the other way to prevent bow waves under the ice breaking through. Even former Top Gear Stig and Bond stuntman Ben Collins tells me he thinks that’s a truly crazy job. Then of course there are the jobs that involve both speed and a seriously long time spent under pressure. I’m talking about World Endurance Championship racing drivers. No wonder so many former F1 drivers consider the Le Mans 24 Hours a very worthy next step. To race in three-hour stints at speeds that reach 200mph, is barkingly insane. To do it at 3am, in the pitch black, is something else again. The winning prototype car last year covered 395 laps on its Michelin tyres, and the winning car in 2010 covered 3,362 miles. In one race. And what of World Rally Championship co-drivers, who must not only risk travel sickness by reading pace notes at speed, but trust their lives to the driver as he hurtles flat out through forests and round country lanes? Of course, all this pales into insignificance alongside the hardest and most dangerous job of the lot, bar none. Spare a thought, ladies and gentlemen, for the driving instructor. For the crashes, the missed gears, the leisurely pulling out in front of traffic, the tears, the tantrums, the bad drivers out there learning and asking you to get in a car with them. Andy Green, you’ve got nothing on these.
