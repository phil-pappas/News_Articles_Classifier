Of these, 2,800 were men and 2,999 were women. Last year, Caja doctors issued 17,650 sick-leave permits to 11,682 workers for depression.\nThe Caja’s disability commission, which oversees sick and disability leave, reported that an additional 22,924 people applied for sick leave due to stress-related disorders.\n“These people accounted for a total of 365,712 days off of work, representing ₡5.6 billion [$10.3 million] in expenses for the Caja,” the commission reported.\nThe most affected age group last year was 20- to 44-year-olds, followed by 45- to 64-year-olds.\nCarolina Montoya, head of the National Psychiatric Hospital’s rehabilitation department, said the campaign is based on messages to help viewers understand the benefits of maintaining good mental health.\n“Life consists of moments, so we are emphasizing activities shared with family and friends,” she said.\nQuality time with family and friends, along with individual and group recreational activities contribute to wellness and stress prevention, she added.\nThe media campaign is being aired on television and radio, and published in newspapers and on social media. It includes public recreational activities across the country for the rest of the year.\nMontoya noted that the aim of the campaign is to raise awareness about mental health in the adult population, but that the messages also target children.\nWatch one of the campaign’s TV spots:\nContact L.
