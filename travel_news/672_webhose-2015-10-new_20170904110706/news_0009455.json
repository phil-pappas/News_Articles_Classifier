The capital of Sichuan province is also a growing MICE destination and we are pleased that Hilton Chengdu has joined our portfolio as our 66th hotel in Greater China.\" \nHilton Chengdu's eye-catching architecture is courtesy of world-renowned design firm, Atkins, which was also behind high profile projects such as the development of downtown Dubai and the Eiffel Tower light displays. The hotel building is capped with crystal-like structures and at night-fall, visitors are treated to a light show put together by the same company that was responsible for the famous light displays at the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The interior of the hotel draws inspiration from the galaxy and features different lighting installations set against a lobby that boasts a three-storey high ceiling. \nHilton Chengdu is located in the new CBD area of Chengdu, opposite the rapidly expanding Tianfu Software Park and close to the Century City Convention Center, which is the latest International Exhibition & Convention Center. \nHilton Chengdu's 395 rooms and suites emulate Sichuan design elements while offering modern features. \nRecreational facilities at Hilton Chengdu include a full service spa, a well-equipped 24-hour fitness center and a rooftop swimming pool.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:51:11.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
