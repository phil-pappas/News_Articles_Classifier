The beloved 143-year-old landmark established the classic California beach town as an important commercial port for goods and passengers traveling between Los Angeles and San Francisco, but safety concerns over the deteriorating pilings that support the wooden structure shut it down in 2013. A ribbon cutting and tour of the rehabbed pier will be the warm-up act for the popular Hawaiian slack-key guitarist Makana. \nVitals: Oct. 31, 1-5 p.m. Free. Ocean Front Street, Cayucos.
