The panel will centre on Abu Dhabi’s incredible journey in becoming a location of choice for content creation for global audiences. The panel will be moderated by Christophe Erbes, the children’s media author and former children’s TV executive, and will feature Paul Baker, twofour54’s Executive Director for Film and TV Services. Speaking about twofour54’s involvement in MIPCOM Paul Baker commented: “Our participation at MIPCOM this year is a fantastic opportunity to collaborate with our valued collaborative partners discussing Abu Dhabi’s transformation into a world-class content creation hub. Over the past two years, Abu Dhabi has attracted major productions including Fast & Furious 7, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, The Bold and the Beautiful, Top Gear, and Nissan PlayStation’s GT Academy – in addition to a host of Arabic projects including The Brothers and the Arabic version of Sesame Street Iftah Ya Simsim, MIPCOM is a great platform for us to showcase the strength of Abu Dhabi’s offering.” He added: “twofour54 facilitates a comprehensive ecosystem of production services, studios, post-production facilities, highly skilled local talent, and a network of companies that enable seamless, end-to-end facilitation of media projects in one location. twofour54’s efforts over the past eight years have yielded outstanding results and we look forward to embracing MIPCOM as an avenue to showcase what Abu Dhabi has to offer and ultimately, attracting more projects to the Emirate.” Paul continued. Abu Dhabi Film Commission has contributed to attracting productions to Abu Dhabi by offering a 30% cash back rebate, which applies to production spend in Abu Dhabi, free scouting assistance and a diverse range of unique locations including stunning coastline with year-round blue skies, wild desert, amazing oasis and iconic architecture. MIPCOM holds a number of networking, screening, and conference events over the course of its four-day programme and welcomed over 13,500 attendees in 2014. The event has become a robust stage for industry professionals to connect, access collaboration opportunities, and discover new channels to launch and promote projects.
