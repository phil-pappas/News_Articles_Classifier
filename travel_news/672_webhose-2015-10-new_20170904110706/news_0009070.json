Float tours are available daily inside the Grand Canyon National Park. They are a lot of fun, so don't miss the chance to take one. Rafting Tours Fill Up Fast Since the rafting tours last so long, they only depart once a day, and that means there is a lot of demand for available seats. You can choose from the float tour only, or you could even add on some extra touring to make the experience even more special. A basic rafting tour starts out with a bus ride to the Glen Canyon Dam were your raft awaits, however, you can upgrade the tour and fly to the Dam instead and use the extra time to take a Jeep tour through the park. You'll see many important and scenic landmarks, such as Horseshoe Bend. The entire tour is very scenic, and you'll have a lot of opportunities to take some great photos. Touring By Raft The rafting tour covers 15 miles of the Colorado River as it winds through the Grand Canyon. It goes through Horseshoe Bend and some other beautiful landing nooks along the way. There is lunch included with the package, and on one of the stops you can even enter the secret canyon at Petroglyph Beach. This beach connects you with the ancient settler area of the Grand Canyon, so you can ground your energy before continuing along the tour. The rafts used on the tours carry 19 people, so these outings are great for groups. This portion of the Colorado River has smooth waters, so you don't have to worry about white water rapids. These float tours are suitable for small kids too since there are no rough waters, so don't hesitate to bring your kids for a trip they'll never forget. Since the raft carries so many people, it's a perfect outing for an extended family trip or a company adventure. However, you want to book your tour in advance to make sure you reserve all the seats your group needs. You should come prepared for your tour, taking into account the fact that you will be outside all day. Bring a waterproof bag where you can keep a change of clothes, and any snacks and accessories. Make sure you bring some extra bottled water too. Don't forget to apply sunscreen at appropriate times throughout the day, and try to wear lightweight clothing that covers up as much as possible, and bring a wide brimmed hat. The sun shines bright and gets hot inside the Grand Canyon, so be prepared. Wrapping Up As an added bonus, you'll have an expert guide on your river tour that will bring the area to life. The tour guide makes sure you don't miss seeing important landmarks and other areas of interest. So don't forget to book your tour early, and do it online. If you're looking for the budget tour, book the one that transports you to the Dam by bus. However, if you can make the stretch for the airplane and 4x4 tour, then you won't regret it. The Grand Canyon is a popular tourist destination for a reason, it's one of the most unique places in America. So if you're looking for adventure, look no further than the Grand Canyon and a float tour on the Colorado River.
