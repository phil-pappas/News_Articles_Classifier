Ursula Andress as Honey Ryder rising Venus-like from the Caribbean in 1962’s Dr No?\nOr is it Daniel Craig’s own iconic appearance from the surf in his snug bathing shorts in a scene shot in the Bahamas for Casino Royale in 2006?\nThese notable exceptions apart, Bond movies are largely about good-looking people knocking seven bells out of each other.\nIn December 2013, a new restaurant, Ice Q, was opened at a height of 10,000ft on the peak of the Gaislachkogl\nBut while one fight blurs into the next, the attractive locations where they happen have a habit of lodging in your memory.\nGiven that a Bond film is seen by an awful lot of people – more than 35 million paid to see Skyfall at the cinema in the United States alone – it’s not surprising that for most tourist destinations, a proposed visit from a Bond production crew is the equivalent of a big win on the lottery.\n 2 Next From restaurant to runway: Hungry passengers can now order...

Half-term heaven: Children will love every action-packed... 007'S GREATEST MOMENT By Mark Mason for Mail on Sunday\nPlaying it cool: Hanley, right, and another Bond girl with Lazenby\nThe helicopter appears from nowhere, its approach hidden by the mountain.\nAs it passes over our heads, there are bursts of gunfire that have us clutching at our hearts, in shock if not genuine injury.\nThe second time around, the helicopter lands and out steps James Bond himself – in the form of George Lazenby.\nHe’s here at Piz Gloria, the 007-themed attraction atop Switzerland’s Schilthorn mountain, to launch its Walk of Fame.\nThis honours the stars of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, the 1969 film in which Piz Gloria’s restaurant featured as the hideout of villain Blofeld.\nSeveral of those involved in the film are present, including Jenny Hanley. Before she hosted children’s show Magpie, Hanley was one of Blofeld’s ‘Angels of Death’. She and I are soon involved in a discussion about the correct collective noun for a group of Bond girls.\nWe reject ‘bevy’ as too obvious. Other suggestions are too risqué for a family newspaper. The ‘Bond World’ section of Piz Gloria shows clips from the movie, including the ski chase where Blofeld (Telly Savalas) pursues 007 down the mountain. At one point the villain hits a tree, prompting Lazenby to quip: ‘He’s branched off.’\nThere’s a helicopter simulator in which you can attempt your own landing at Piz Gloria, as well as a bobsleigh car positioned before a screen, allowing you to recreate part of the ski chase with yourself as the star.\nInstructions tell you when to lean left or right, as well as when to fire the gun, and afterwards you can play back your role at leisure.\nAs the evening comes to an end, Jenny and I finally solve the collective-noun problem. It is, we decide, a ‘cleavage’ of Bond girls.\nAlmost a year ago, the crew from the forthcoming blockbuster Spectre went to Solden in Austria’s South Tyrol to finalise plans for location filming.\nThere are better known ski resorts in this part of Austria: for example, the long-standing British favourite Obergurgl is just up the road.\nBut when you’re looking for a modern building that will ‘play the part’ of a mountaintop residence, it’s not the number of testing ski runs that you’re considering – it’s glamour.\nIn December 2013, the Bergbahnen Solden Lift Company opened a new restaurant at a height of 10,000ft on the peak of the Gaislachkogl – the area’s number one ski mountain – and they can hardly have guessed that they were creating a future Bond star.\nThe Ice Q restaurant promises gourmet cuisine, excellent wines, 94 seats inside, 34 seats on the terrace and efficient table service.\nWhile this is all delightful, this won’t be the main reason so many have visited here; this is an ultra-modern restaurant with a view (and only two rapid cable car rides up from Solden).\nAs you sit here gazing out, your mind is not fully on the special pinot painstakingly created to be enjoyed at this rarefied height of 10,000ft – what you’re really drinking in is the jaw-dropping scenery. (The altitude here really does make you breathless, even before the effects of the scenery work their magic.)\nThe floor-to-ceiling picture windows of Ice Q restaurant are filled with views of the stunning Otztal mountains.\nThe architect designed the building to be as transparent as possible, and so fit seamlessly into its natural surroundings.\nTogether with the neighbouring top station of the mountain gondola, it ranks among Tyrol’s undisputed highlights: this an architectural ski resort masterpiece that surpasses any other.\nWhat part does the Ice Q restaurant play in Spectre? Well, with the film’s premiere still a few weeks away, people who might know the answer to that question clam up and plead that it is as secret as any code lodged in M’s safe.\nOne thing we do know about the films is that the plot will be fairly preposterous – but you’re not watching Bond for verisimilitude. This is a fantasy world, into which the Ice Q fits perfectly.\nOur waiter fondly remembered the day earlier this year that Hollywood came to his mountaintop. Daniel Craig was happy to chat between scenes, while his co-star Lea Seydoux looked suitably glamorous, helicopters buzzed the valleys and Range Rovers burst into flames. ‘It was freezing but Daniel was cool,’ said the waiter. Well, 007 has always had a licence to chill.\nIt’s understood that a replica of the Ice Q restaurant was created at Pinewood Studios, which suggests that Solden plays a significant part in the story, and could even be used as the baddie’s mountaintop lair (it wouldn’t be a Bond film without a mountaintop lair),\nGiven that the Ice Q is under shared ownership with the excellent Das Central hotel in the heart of Solden, it might have been expected that this was where Craig would be based during filming.\nMountain Marvel: Craig on location while filming Spectre - which is due for release in the UK on October 26\nLady in black: Craig's co-star Lea Seydoux filming the latest 007 film in Solden earlier this year\nHowever, the production company wanted an entire floor where he could rest undisturbed.\nThis wasn’t possible at Das Central, so Craig had a floor to himself at the nearby Hotel Bergland instead.\nBy not staying at the Central, however, the actor missed a treat.\nThe Central is the hotel equivalent of an iceberg: big above ground but massive below it, a labyrinthine maze offering one of the biggest hotel spas I’ve ever seen.\nThe Central does not just boast the regulation pool, sauna and Turkish bath; there are several pools, saunas and Turkish baths (some where you can wear a swimming costume, some where you are asked to divest your outfit – always a testing moment for buttoned-up Brits but a bare-all rule, one supposes, that any self-respecting 007 would have been delighted to obey).\nLocals are excitedly anticipating their 15 minutes of Hollywood fame when Spectre reaches the cinemas, and crossing their fingers for a resulting rush of visitors keen to wander in Bond’s footsteps.\n‘I know it’s only film,’ said a Bergland receptionist. ‘But we had James Bond staying here.\n‘I gave him his room key! How do you top that?’\nTRAVEL FACTS Das Central ( central-soelden.at ) has double rooms available from £142 per person, based on two people sharing on a half-board basis.
