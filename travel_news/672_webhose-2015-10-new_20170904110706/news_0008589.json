These flights go over the Park, as well as to the top and the bottom. Learn more. Read this article. \nIf you want to take a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon, you can fly out of Arizona or Nevada, but the tours out of Nevada are the only ones that land at the canyon. Choosing a deluxe Las Vegas helicopter tour will give you the best experience. Less Than An Hour To The CanyonA side trip is a nice break from the excitement of Vegas since it is just a short 45 minute to the West Rim. The flight isn't wasted time since you'll see interesting things during the trip such as Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam. Visiting the canyon is a breathtaking experience. And seeing it from the air in a helicopter makes it even better. Plus, landing at the canyon so you can explore on foot only adds to the fun. When you take a landing tour to the West Rim, you can opt for a tour package that lands on top of the rim or one that flies down to the canyon floor. If you want to descend to the bottom of the canyon, then the champagne picnic tour is a good one to take. This package will set you down next to the Colorado River, where you can toast to the journey, and the magnificent canyon walls. You can add a boat ride to this trip as well as a flight back to the top of the canyon for some more exploring. The Skywalk ExperienceThe Skywalk is on top of the West Rim, and you don't want to miss it. The Skywalk is a huge platform that's made from glass panels that lets you look down to the canyon floor 4000 feet below you. A walk on the Skywalk is the perfect way to top off an exhilarating helicopter tour of the canyon. Tour ChoicesYou will have the option to choose a basic or deluxe tour package. Both provide mind blowing sightseeing, but as the names imply, one adds a little bit extra. One difference is the basic tours take off from Boulder City which is just outside of Vegas. If you can opt for deluxe Las Vegas helicopters, then I highly recommend doing so. The tours utilize the state-of-the-art EcoStar sightseeing helicopters. These choppers are quieter, more comfortable, and provide better views than any other tour helicopter. The huge panoramic viewing window and spacious cabin makes the deluxe tour worth every penny. Deluxe tours come with a complimentary limousine service, they depart from The Strip, and you will also be able to enjoy a Las Vegas flyover, which is especially impressive if you choose a sunset tour. Be Sure To Book EarlyMy rule of thumb is to book right after you have organized your accommodation. Since the chopper tours are so popular, they fill up fast, so try to get your tour purchased about two weeks ahead of time. Also, buy your tickets online so you can cut out the markup added by travel agents. Buying your tour online is easy when you use your credit card, and it will qualify you for the low Internet rate and instant confirmation of your flight reservations. You Won't Forget An Exciting Air TourLas Vegas helicopter tours provide for the perfect vacation experience. With so many options to have the perfect adventure, there's no excuse not to take an air tour while you're in Las Vegas. Don't forget to buy your tour early and buy it online. You don't want to miss out on the flight of a lifetime that gives you the perfect view of one of America's most loved landmarks.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nThe author is an expert on Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon and recommends these helicopter tour reviews http://grandcanyoncheap.com/helicopter-tours.html and these helicopter tour coupons: http://grandcanyoncheap.com/helicopter-deals.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:04:33.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
