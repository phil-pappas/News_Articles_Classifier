The Body Shop returned to the Bedfordshire-based Village for its second event exactly a year on from its first. To celebrate the company as Woburn’s first anniversary client, Wayne Matton, General Manager at Woburn Forest, and Ryan Gray, Head of Sales, presented Tracy Lees, UK Market Office Manager for The Body Shop, and Linda Campbell, UK Retail Director, with a beautifully carved, handmade bird box. \nSituated within 365-acres of natural woodland, Woburn Forest has experienced unprecedented demand and success during the last 12 months. The Village has welcomed 140 events with over 10,000 delegates in the last year, and has hosted corporate organisations such as Amplifon, Virgin Atlantic and TPRG (Theo Paphitis Retail Group). Demand for teambuilding events in an inspiring setting continues to grow, with the Village seeing an increase in companies choosing to dedicate time in their conference programme to a teambuilding activity. Of the 140 events that have been hosted at Woburn Forest in the last 12 months, 70% have used teambuilding facilities. Ryan Gray, Head of Sales, said: “Woburn Forest has experienced a fantastic first year open for conferences and events and we are already well on track for a record pace in 2016, which is great news. Our newest Village benefits from being located just under an hour away from London offering city-based organisations a forest retreat complete with ample conference facilities in The Venue and an array of teambuilding activities to suit all personalities. “As we have seen with The Body Shop, who we were thrilled to celebrate our first anniversary with, clients continue to return to the Village for their conferences and events.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:57:30.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
