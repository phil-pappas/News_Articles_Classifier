The museum has managed to reduce the number of cases by capping visitors, especially during the National Holiday week. \nAt the Beijing Zoo, tourists went wild feeding animals. One visitor fed an entire bag of vegetables and carrot sticks to a gazelle. Another tried to lure an elephant closer by throwing grapes in a line towards him. Three alpacas were quarantined after overfeeding during the Golden Week bonanza. \nChildren were almost indistinguishable from their zoo counterparts. One child broke his arm after climbing onto and falling from a rail at China's Palace Museum. In the Beijing Zoo, children ignored warning signs and clambered over animal statues as if they were monkey bars on a playground, said the report. \nDespite Beijing's ban on smoking in public areas, the law went all but defunct over Golden Week. In the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, cigarette ashes and butts littered the trash cans in 'non-smoking areas.' \"Most of the tourists were fairly well-mannered, despite some of them asking me where to find an area to smoke,\" said one of the grounds maintenance staff. \nChina published the Tourism Law in 2013 to regulate its citizens' notorious disregard for public decency while on vacation. Any behavior that is 'uncivilized' qualifies for a fine. Those caught smoking in public areas can be fined a maximum of 200 yuan (US$32).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:49:10.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
