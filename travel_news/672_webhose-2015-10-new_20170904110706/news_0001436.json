When an to-be mother went into labor earlier than expected on a flight from Taiwan to Los Angeles, flight attendants asked if there was a doctor onboard. Dr. Angelica Zen stepped up to help. Having flight attendants acting as her stand-in nurses, Dr. Zen was able to deliver a healthy baby, even though she had never done so before. The newborn girl was greeted with a round of a applause from the entire flight as her first introduction to the world. The captain of the flight changed course to the closest airport, in Anchorage. According to ABC 7 , it is unclear if the baby was born in a 12 mile range of Alaska, which would make the baby a U.S. citizen. Contact Ron Paul Gavino at rgavino@reviewjournal.com .
