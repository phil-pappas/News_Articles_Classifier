For example, strawberries pair well with white wine, roasted meats with beer, peanuts with peanut butter, etc, as the flavours are similar and overlap. The western concepts of cooking swear by this method, and most of their food preparation is based on combining similar flavours.\nBut did you know that Indian food turns this concept on its head, revelling in the perfect harmony of flavours that actually clash? Any Indian dish would have at least about seven ingredients, all of them having absolutely contrasting flavours. For example, onion, herbs, red chilli powder, coriander, garam masala and turmeric are the fundamentals of most Indian dishes. And yet, none of these flavours complement each other.\nSurprisingly, this clash is what makes Indian food one of the most tasty cuisines in the world, as discovered in an experiment recently by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur. What these researchers did was, they analysed over 2,000 recipes from the popular website Tarladalal.com, and examined the ingredients used in Indian food at the molecular level. They discovered that except for a minor overlap in some ingredients, most others actually had clashing flavours.\n“Opposites attract,” is how chef Arun Sundararaj, executive chef at Delhi’s Taj Mahal Hotel, explains this phenomenon. Having dabbled in various regional cuisines of India during his stints at the chain’s multiple properties in Mumbai, Goa, Hyderabad, and now New Delhi, he feels Indian food is like a symphony performed by an orchestra. “Each spice and ingredient has nothing in common with the other, just like the various music instruments in an orchestra. But together they can produce magic if combined in the right measures and with proper techniques.”\nThe westerners don’t have as many ingredients and spices to play around with and not many that contradict in terms of flavour. So they prefer to pair food to create their dishes. For example, if anyone cooking an Indian dish is controlling two contrasting flavours like cinnamon against cumin, in a western dish, something like pepper is controlled against the entire dish, as it’s probably the only spice being used.\n“Even a regular household in India is exposed to a part of the large gamut of spices that we have. The everyday garam masala is a perfect example. A regular masala will have cumin, cardamom, pepper, cinnamon, etc. But add things like nutmeg, jaiphal and black cardamom, and you are just adding to the whole flavour, which will take things to a new level. Despite being very clashing flavours, all these spices come together beautifully if balanced well,” he says.\nThen cuisines in places like Hyderabad and Lucknow use potli masalas that have exotic elements like khas ki jad, dry rose, sweet sticks, etc. In a potli masala, there are at least 12-13 spices, but the final flavour they produce is something else—a perfect blend, a new flavour. “The only key is balance, using things in the right amounts, which is the essence of any regional cooking in India.”\nA typical western sauce will have cream, butter, flour, eggs, wine, vinegar, salt and pepper. All these flavours are uni-directional and have no clash with each other. This is perhaps why a dish like chicken tikka masala was such a runaway hit in the UK. The flavours and textures were absolutely shocking and surprising to the people. Chilli, tomato gravy, smoky char-grilled meat—all these undiscovered elements coming together in a single dish were a welcome surprise to the Brits, otherwise used to bland, floury sauces and poached meats. It’s another matter that the avatar in which the dish is served across the West tastes nothing like actual Indian food.\n“Most westerners are either shocked by the variety of spices used in Indian food, saying ‘we have been missing so much all this while’, or are just unable to handle the spice levels,” chuckles chef Sundararaj.\nHowever, the real beauty in Indian cooking is in its diversity, with even a simple dish like sambar having multiple versions, differing across regions and even households. And, the real champions are the housewives, who ladle up dishes that even accomplished chefs are unable to reproduce in their extensively-equipped kitchens. Unity in diversity—that’s a motto that applies well to Indian food as well.\n 25, 2015 12:03 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:26:45.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
