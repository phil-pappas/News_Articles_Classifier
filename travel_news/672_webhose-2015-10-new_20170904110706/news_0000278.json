Along the campaign, KEEN , maker of original hybrid footwear, collected more than 30,000 petition signatures, rallied support from more than 40 businesses, and hosted more than 47 events – including a reception on Capitol Hill that marked the finale of the 2015 tour and start of KEEN's 2016 campaign efforts.\n\"This summer, through the Live Monumental road trip, we experienced some of the most treasured landscapes in America,\" said Linda Balfour , KEEN brand marketing manager. \"Along the way we connected with thousands of people with a shared passion for our natural playgrounds and preserving the public lands on which we play. We look forward to carrying the momentum and enthusiasm generated by the trip into 2016.\"\nROAD TRIP VIDEO | LiveMonumental.com\nIn addition to recreating with, engaging, and educating tens-of-thousands of supporters about public lands and national monuments along the cross-country trip, the campaign urged the Obama Administration to protect five specific areas in the U.S. that have environmental, recreational, and historic significance, and designate them as national monuments through the Antiquities Act . The areas include: Mojave Desert, CA, Owyhee Canyonlands, OR, Birthplace of Rivers, WV, Boulder-White Clouds, ID, and Gold Butte, NV. A victory during the campaign came on Aug. 7 when Idaho's majestic Boulder-White Clouds was permanently protected as Wilderness.\nFrom collaborating with local, regional, and national organizations to raising awareness of public lands in communities around the country to sitting down with government policy makers at the local, state, and federal levels, the campaign sculpted a strong foundation in which to build on for 2016. Live Monumental celebrates our lands, and was designed to immerse with people across the U.S. to rally support, enjoy our natural surroundings, and have lots of fun in the process – with the RV as a centerpiece for the mission.\nMajor focuses for 2016 will include amplifying local outreach and support in and around Live Monumental's targeted locations, attracting advocacy from more businesses, and attaining a critical mass of signatures before President Obama leaves office with the hope of having the remaining four areas preserved as national monuments.\nTo learn more, please visit: livemonumental.com .\n#LiveMonumental\nAbout KEEN\nInspired by a love of the outdoors, KEEN, maker of original hybrid footwear, supports the lifestyles and outdoor adventures of active people around the world and is committed to building stronger communities and a healthier planet. keenfootwear.com .\nMEDIA CONTACT | Keith Cozzens | Verde Brand Communications | keith@verdepr.com | 970.259.3555 x122\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/277003LOGO\n releases/keens-live-monumental-road-trip-wraps-up-as-campaign-sets-sights-on-2016-300159932.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquities_Act", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151014/277003LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA28673&Transmission_Id=201510150900PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA28673&DateId=20151015", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/keens-live-monumental-road-trip-wraps-up-as-campaign-sets-sights-on-2016-300159932.html", "http://www.verdepr.com/", "http://www.keenfootwear.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/277003LOGO", "http://www.keenfootwear.com/livemonumental"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:26:30.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
