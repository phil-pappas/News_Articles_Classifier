After a long day on the Grand Vitesse from Paris, we stopped off for the night in Montpellier before travelling on to friends in Montélimar. We checked into a little inn opposite the station and went out for a stroll after settling in, watching the colourful trams bustling past. The trams going one way were wrapped in huge junk jewellery on a glowing blue background, and were covered in giant fruit [motifs] in bright citrus colours. Even the seats were upholstered in bright colours. The city had once asked the citizens if they wanted new trams, but everyone said non. They preferred their retro ones. We sat at a pavement café and ordered drinks and snacks. At first the charming Algerian lady said she had no snacks, but then came out with some warm, newly baked salty almonds. When we tried to pay for them she refused, saying that they were from her own stores. Then we strolled into the town centre, pausing to admire a very old ginkgo tree with roots sprawling across the ground in a park and children on a carousel. In the morning the proprietor came bustling in with a huge tray laden with bright orange apricots, huge light croissants, muesli, jam and cheese and creamy local yogurt. After that we reluctantly headed across the street to take the train to our final destination. A wonderful discovery.

When I got lost in Venice, I found myself by the university. Entering its piazza, I heard blood-curdling screams and raucous laughter. A student stood in the middle wearing false breasts, thigh-length boots, Y-fronts and a laurel wreath. Plastered in flour, eggs and ketchup, he read from a scroll and giggled uncontrollably. When he fluffed his lines, onlookers jeered, pelted him with stinking fish and squirted him with cream. Then his “friends” forced him to run the gauntlet of thwacks with fly-swatters, newspapers and kicks to his backside. Piazza San Marco in Venice Photo: Fotolia/AP The student had graduated and was reading out the papiro. He had to wear outrageous clothes chosen by friends. This is the custom in Venice and the Veneto. The friends inscribe the papiro with hilarious incidents from his life. Afterwards, the papiro is pasted on a wall and everyone drinks prosecco. Shelley White Exploring “hidden” Venice on foot is easy and rewarding . Work out your hotel’s position in relation to the railway station, San Marco, Rialto, Accademia or Piazzale Roma, memorise the route from whichever is closest to the hotel and you will never get lost – well, not for long – as just around the next corner, or the next, you will find a wall sign pointing the way to one or two of these landmarks. Then you can explore at will, even after dark, discovering new campi or recognising ones you think you know, but whose names you can’t remember. And go in late October or early November when the weather is still warm but the crowds have gone; there might be an acqua alta but it won’t last long and adds to the adventure. Hilary Spon To Jonathan Glancey’s list I’d like to add Campo Maria Mater Domini in Santa Croce . Comment posted online Flying Scotsman Catherine Farrell, Quote: d in Adrian Bridge’s Travel News story last week, was right to say the climb to Ais Gill will be an extreme challenge for the soon-to-return Flying Scotsman (“ Grab a ticket for the return of the Flying Scotsman ”). The old Midland Railway always ran double-headed or with a banker up that climb. If the Flying Scotsman can handle it solo with eight coaches she’s ready for anything. Comment posted online When I was about nine , I was admiring the Flying Scotsman at Newcastle Central when I was invited on board. What a thrill! I was amazed by the heat when the fire door was opened for a shovelful of coal. The thrill was not quite replicated when I later got the Hornby Dublo model. Comment posted online A steam train on the Glenfinnan Viaduct in Scotland Photo: Fotolia/AP Airline meals Our picture gallery of on-board food on airlines and Chris Leadbeater’s piece in defence of the airline meal drew a lot of comment online. Here’s a flavour: I fly often, usually long-haul – always in economy and always on major airlines. I usually find the meals reasonably tasty and sometimes rather good. If I was paying several thousand, rather than several hundred, dollars for the flight I’d expect better. Flying, especially long haul, is so tedious, I’d consider eating ANYTHING just to break the monotony. Most other travellers seem to feel the same. If you want fine dining, go to a restaurant. Unless you are up the front, airline food is a lost cause. Take a picnic on board from one of the airport options. Best ever airline meal ever was on a Qantas internal flight; a meat pie and mash washed down with a cheeky XXXX or five. 'Unless you are up the front, airline food is a lost cause' Photo: Fotolia/AP I flew to Rome with budget airline Monarch in August and the meals both ways were very good and filling. Mind you, I did have to pay extra for them: maybe that’s why they were so good. It’s not really the food that’s the problem, it’s trying to eat with dignity armed only with useless plastic cutlery in a space that gives you no elbow room.
