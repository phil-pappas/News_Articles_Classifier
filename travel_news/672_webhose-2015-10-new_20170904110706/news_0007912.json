A striking and memorable base for exploring “royal” Norfolk. Location: 8/10 Built in 1877 to supply the royal family with water, this red-brick octagonal tower stands on a low hilltop within the arable fields and woodland of the peaceful Sandringham estate. The tower's 'viewing room', with spectacular prospect over the surrounding countryside Close to the small village of West Newton, it’s a 20-minute drive to King’s Lynn and the Wash, and nine miles from the beach resort at Hunstanton. The best beaches, seaside villages and market towns of North Norfolk are within an easy and scenic drive. Style & character: 8/10 The second floor “viewing room”, which contains a double bed and armchairs grouped around an open fire, looks out over the beautiful surrounding estate. However, this outlook is surpassed by the breath-taking panorama of the surrounding countryside from the rooftop, a perfect lookout for stargazing and sunrises. The cosy, “back in time” atmosphere (sepia photos of royal family groups on game shoots, strong Victorian colour schemes, old-fashioned lighting and solid antique furniture) is combined with modern additions: a tiny ground-floor shower room and large, third-floor bathroom, accessible up a steep, wrought iron spiral staircase. Steep stairs make the tower unsuitable for very young children Curl up with an interesting choice of local guide books and the detailed account of the waterpower's history, plus a collection of guest books dating back to 1977. Paintwork is shabby in places; the Landmark Trust says that a renovation is planned. Facilities: 6/10 Adequate and clean. The simple, wood-floored kitchen has an electric cooker, small fridge, microwave and large dresser with blue-and-white Old Chelsea crockery. No dishwasher, television or Wifi – but there is a washing machine. Only two deck chairs are provided for the rooftop sitting area; a couple more would be useful. Value for money: 8/10 From £855 to £1,754 per week. Three nights from £562. Family friendly: 7/10 Babies and children are welcome but steep stairs could be hazardous for toddlers and small children. Dogs are allowed. Eating Local produce from Walsingham Farms Shop at Heacham. Good food from The Rose and Crown pub at Snettisham . Details Landmark Trust (01628 825925; landmarktrust.org.uk ). Access for guests with disabilities? Not suitable. Steep, narrow stairs, no ground floor bedrooms.
