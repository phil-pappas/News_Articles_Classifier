As Mexico’s capital and one of the largest markets in the Americas, Mexico City marks JetBlue’s 91st destination in its global network and 35th destination in the Latin America and Caribbean region.\n“We are thrilled to launch nonstop service to Mexico City from our two Florida focus cities,” said Dave Clark, vice president network planning, JetBlue. “Mexico City is one of the Americas’ most cosmopolitan cities, with a unique and rich history, beautiful architecture, world-class museums and lively nightlife. Our new nonstop service makes it easy to get there for business or leisure and our flights are timed to allow connections from many points throughout the JetBlue network. We also look forward to introducing the JetBlue experience to Mexico City based travelers and welcoming them onboard flights to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and many other destinations across the JetBlue network.”\nThe daily service from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood and Orlando to Mexico City operates on JetBlue’s spacious A320 aircraft featuring the most legroom in coach*, free first-run Hollywood movies on flights to/from Mexico City, and unlimited snacks and soft drinks. Flights to Mexico City operate in the evening, with flights returning to the U.S. in the early morning.\nTravelers can also choose to continue on to other destinations in JetBlue’s network such as New York, Washington, D.C. and Boston.\n“Mexico City is privileged to have strategic partners that enable the increase in the supply of air transportation to generate a greater number of international visitors to Mexico City. With the start of operations by JetBlue, the daily operations from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood and Orlando to Mexico City, will result in a greater number of foreign visitors to the destination and an increase in hotel occupancy, which will generate more economic profit for tourism service providers of this city,” said Miguel Torruco Marques, Minister of Tourism of Mexico City.”\nJetBlue continues to grow its footprint in Latin America and the Caribbean. The airline now offers up to 142 daily flights from the U.S. to Latin America and the Caribbean, of which up to 49 daily flights are nonstop from Ft.
