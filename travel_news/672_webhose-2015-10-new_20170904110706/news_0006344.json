More often than not, I’m too uncomfortable and I fear someone will run off with my belongings. But fortunately for those like me, more and more airports are installing sleeping options that allow passengers in transit to squeeze in some quick, quality sleep.\nAll these tiny rooms — whether they’re called pods, cubicles, cabs or capsules — provide a spot to snooze with some dignity, meaning not splayed out across three chairs for the gawking pleasure of passers-by . They’re mostly past airport security and all bookable by the hour, which is doubly convenient, plus budget friendly.\nThe options range in size, price and amenities provided — some even have high-def TVs — though the majority presently operating in airports are from a handful of chain providers like Yotel, which is a well-known capsule hotel brand. Some are self-service, and others, like Minute Suites (where they’ll even do you the courtesy of a wake-up call) are staffed. The more spartan, the cheaper they tend to be, with prices ranging from around $15 per hour to upwards of $30.\nHere’s where to find airport nooks to take a nap:\nAbu Dhabi (AUB): GoSleep pods in Terminal 3, at Gate 35.\nAmsterdam Schiphol (AMS): Yotel capsule hotel, main terminal in Lounge 2, near Pier D.
