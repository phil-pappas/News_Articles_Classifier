Present at the meeting representing the Indian Ocean Vanilla Islands were Pascal Viroleau, the CEO of the Vanilla islands; Arnaud Martin, the Chairman of the Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority (MTPA); Ambassador Joel Rault, the Ambassador of the Republic of Mauritius accredited to France; Minister Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture; and Patrick Serveaux, the Head of Ile Reunion Tourisme (IRT). \nThe consensus arrived at is that Silvesea Cruises is ready to look at the Indian Ocean region for the positioning of one of their luxury small cruise ships, and proposals would be discussed in greater details during the November World Travel Market (WTM) Tourism Trade Fair of London in November. Both sides have more homework to do before a firm decision and announcement can be made, but the meeting was seen by all as productive and interesting.
