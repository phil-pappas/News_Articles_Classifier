It’s crammed with the kind of poetic headstones, artful statuary and intriguing tales that make for a fascinating, if slightly macabre, day out.\nAnd the best way to take it all in? A tour of Highgate’s West Cemetery, a richly historic swath only accessible via guided walks.\nFollow this with a self-directed weave around the almost equally antique East Cemetery, “eternal residence” of luminaries from Karl Marx to Malcolm McLaren.\n“We can only scratch the surface today but we’ll definitely see all the parts of the cemetery,” says twinkle-eyed guide Kevin Bourne as 15 visitors from around the world gather in the West Cemetery’s cobbled courtyard.\n“Keep your eyes open for large tree roots — and make sure you stay on the path,” he adds.\nFor Bourne, one of several Highgate guides, the tours are an opportunity to share his fascination with funerary architecture. It’s a rich litany of stone-carved symbolism that would be easy to miss on a casual stroll.\nDeciphering angels\nWe learn that angel statues look to the sky to indicate the deceased’s heavenward passage, or mournfully glance downward to represent a grievous loss. A broken or cloth-draped stone column, in contrast, denotes a life cut short, while clasped hands point to souls reuniting in the afterlife.\nBut while Victorians, in particular, were keen on these ornate flourishes, not every 19th-century trend stood the test of time.\nTapping the era’s fascination for all-things Pharaonic, Highgate’s eye-popping Egyptian Avenue was built as an elaborate, obelisk-flanked “street” of vaulted tombs, each with heavy iron doors. Marketed as London’s most fashionable final destination, the trend fell from favor long before the tombs were filled.\nStrolling the avenue today, most of us pull out our cameras — especially at the adjoining Circle of Lebanon. Highgate’s most stately quarter, this round walkway of grand stone chambers was built around a towering, still-standing cedar tree.\nFor decades, it was the cemetery’s most sought-after real estate. But while most tombs are locked, Bourne has a key for the nearby Terrace Catacombs, a Gothic building with an arched, churchlike entrance. Nosing inside and adjusting to the sudden chill and cloaklike gloom, we hear of the 825 coffin spaces — stacked floor-to-ceiling — each with a glass pane or inscription panel at one end.\nOr at least that was the plan.\nIn the decades since bodies were interred here, many panes and panels have disintegrated, exposing some antique coffins to slightly shocked onlookers.\nInching through the brick-vaulted interior, we spot several caskets that have split. Luckily, lead linings in each keep anything untoward from popping out.\nAfter saying goodbye to Bourne back at the West Cemetery entrance, I amble across Swain’s Lane to the East Cemetery. It’s usually about $6 to enter, but West Cemetery tour tickets include free entry here.\nEast Cemetery Opened in 1854, the East Cemetery doubled the size of the original site. And it’s still used today. I spot a simple 2001 headstone for Douglas Adams where fans leave pens for their favorite sci-fi author. There’s also Sex Pistols’ manager Malcolm McLaren’s 2010 grave, complete with death mask.\nThen there’s Marx. I had last visited the gigantic, expansively bearded bust in the 1980s. But the grand, gold-lettered monument hides a story I had long forgotten.\nMarx was buried at Highgate in 1883 in a side-path grave already occupied by his wife. Only 11 mourners attended. By the 1950s, his reputation rising, a fund was launched for relocation and both bodies were moved to a newly hewn tomb on a main path, complete with bold “Workers of all Lands Unite” lettering. The original grave also remains. And this time, using a free map from the main entrance, I search it out. Its cracked, almost illegible stone slab lying on the ground in the trees is well-hidden and rarely visited.\nI spend the rest of the afternoon trawling these side-paths, gingerly inching over tree roots, squinting at faded statuary and pushing aside curtains of ivy to reveal the Gothic lettering on dozens of crumbling headstones. I soon have a shortlist of favorite names — Edward Truelove, Cubitt Nichols and Charles Toogood.\nResident critters\nI also meet a resident critter. Bourne had told me that Highgate is like a wildlife refuge, with foxes, hedgehogs, bats and birds residing unencumbered here — alongside a rare orb spider colony recently discovered in the Egyptian Avenue vaults.\nBut my discovery is less exotic: a black cat posing atop a leaning headstone like a prop from a Halloween diorama. Hopping down, it leads me deeper into the tangled undergrowth, where thick roots stretch like veins across the graves. As the autumn sun slinks away, I realize the ivy here is so thick it’s like a communal blanket for the eternally rested.\nJohn Lee is a U.K.-born writer based in Vancouver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:06:33.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
