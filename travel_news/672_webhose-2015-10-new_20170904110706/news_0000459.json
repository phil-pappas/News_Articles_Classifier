NVN Hotels, an affiliate of Arbor, will manage the hotel as Arbor oversees a significant renovation and revival of the property. The extensive renovation will highlight Hotel Phillips' unique history and reposition the iconic property to be the leading lifestyle and experience-driven hotel in the market with new food & beverage outlets and creative programming. Upon renovation, the hotel will join the Curio Collection by Hilton, a collection of unique hotels appealing to travelers seeking local discovery. \nAn Iconic Past \nSteeped in local history, this art-deco icon of downtown Kansas City originally opened in 1931, and since that time has consistently hosted key business and society events. Listed on the National Registry of Historic Places since 1979, the hotel has hosted many a celebrity in its rooms, from Tina Turner to John Barrymore and many others as they perform nearby. For performers and guests alike, the neighborhood simmers in nightlife and entertainment options, including the live music venues of the adjacent popular nightlife destination, the Power & Light District; the neighboring Sprint Center; and, events at the Kansas City Convention Center. \nOnce the tallest building in Kansas City, the hotel's architecture makes the hotel a nexus in the urban fabric of this \"big small town.\" Equally impactful inside and out, the lobby is on many tourists' bucket list for places to see in Kansas City. Elaborate bronze and nickel metalwork stand out against lustrous walnut paneling, offering a uniquely luxurious yet Midwestern ambiance. \nA Bright Future \nToday, the hotel offers a full-service guest experience, convenient to participants of functions in its approximately 11,000 square feet of flexible meeting and pre-function spaceâ€”or those attending functions in nearby venues. It also features a restaurant and bar, 12 Baltimore, where guests and downtown theatre attendees can enjoy food prepared by an award-winning chef, as well as live music three nights a week. The renovation will add programming to underscore the hotel as a unique local destination, with a vibe appealing to all generations. \n\"We are launching our renovation of this beautiful historic hotel immediately, to deliver a guest experience that takes advantage of all the amenities its downtown location has to offer, and contributes to the revival of the heart of Kansas City,\" explains Vamsi Bonthala, chief executive officer of Arbor Lodging Partners. \nThe sale closed earlier today, and the transition of management is effective immediately. \n\"Our hotel platform is in expansion mode; we want our hotels to offer communal spaces to work and socialize; healthy, local selections of food; and for our guests to have an authentic and satisfying experience,\" added Arbor Lodging Partners principal Sheenal Patel, also chief executive officer of NVN Hotels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:00:10.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
