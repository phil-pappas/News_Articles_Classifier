The airline has been losing money since 2008, amid pressure from low-cost rivals and cash-rich Gulf state carriers. It has gradually cut costs and jobs in recent years and is now in talks with unions over a sweeping plan that involves 2,900 more job losses and longer hours.\nNegotiations broke down after Monday’s violence and resumed Friday between managers and leading pilots unions SNPL and SPAF on Friday. Neither the unions nor Air France commented on the talks publicly.\nThe government, which owns 17 percent of Air France, backs the restructuring plan and was embarrassed by Monday’s violence. Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron told CNN that the incident “is not about France. It’s about stupid people, and they will be condemned for that.”\nMacron is trying to loosen France’s famously stringent labor protections , hoping that will encourage companies to hire and reduce the country’s 10 percent unemployment rate. His moves have angered unions and fellow members within the Socialist government.\nThe resumed negotiations capped a week of unusually high labor tensions in France.\nIn addition to the incidents involving Air France, the streets of Paris overflowed with garbage as about half the city’s waste workers went on strike over wage and career stagnation.\nAfter four days of disruption, city officials and unions reached an agreement Thursday night to end the walkout. City hall said it agreed to raise pay for certain workers and consider expanding promotion opportunities.\nThe Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:13:39.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
