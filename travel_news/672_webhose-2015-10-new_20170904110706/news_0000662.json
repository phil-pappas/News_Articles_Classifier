THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO Cultural & Historical Travel \nOTTAWA -- Installation of a towering stainless-steel sculpture inspired by icebergs began on Monday on the grounds of the Canadian Museum of Nature . \nDesigned by artist and adventurer Bill Lishman, the work will serve as the focal point for the tundra section of the museum's new Landscapes of Canada Gardens, an outdoor botanical exhibit nearing completion. \nThe 13-metre-high sculpture will be \"a vivid reminder of the Arctic as one of Canada's significant natural environments,\" said museum president and CEO Meg Beckel. \nThe permanent installation includes five large components as well as smaller pieces representing ice chunks. Landscapers will lay down granite and limestone rocks as well as Arctic plants to complete the tundra component of the gardens, which also include boreal forest and prairie grassland zones. \nLishman, whose work leading migratory birds with an aircraft was dramatized in the 1996 Oscar-nominated film \"Fly Away Home,\" lives in Blackstock, Ont., near Lake Scugog, and has travelled extensively in the Arctic and Antarctic. \n\"I have every hope my work will bring a semblance of the awe felt by most who experience the vast reality of the Canadian Arctic,\" he said in a statement.
