Keen to replicate this experience at home, coffee fans are increasingly willing to spend more on higher quality products. So as the gap between standard and premium brews widens and producers keep up with demand for new, unusual coffees, have you considered starting your day with something a little different? If you’re feeling brave, why not try the world’s strongest coffee? Death Wish Coffee An early leader in the unusual coffee arena was kopi luwak aka “cat-poo coffee”. A shy cat-like wild animal, the Asian palm civet has a penchant for the ripest of coffee cherries and an inability to digest the stone. Instead, the civit “delivers” the stones back to mother nature, and we humans, in turn, collect them in order to produce a smooth and musky coffee. Much less palatable was the cruel caging of Asian palm civets in a bid to increase coffee production. Thankfully, there are now plenty of options for purchasing it free of cruelty – just be sure to look for official certification. Coffee Direct sells a 227g bag for £39.99. For a really next-level animal-based coffee experience, there’s elephant poo coffee. Like the Asian palm civet, elephants can’t digest coffee beans and thus Black Ivory Coffee was born. Working with the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation , whose residents are mostly rescued from the streets, the elephants have their vegetarian diet supplemented with coffee cherries, the stones of which are later collected from the dung, sun-dried and roasted to produce a coffee with an aroma that is “floral and chocolate”, according to Black Ivory Coffee founder Blake Dinkin. “The taste is chocolate malt with a bit of cherry,” he adds, “and there’s no bitterness.” Although it is currently out of stock, you can join the reserve list for the next batch at blackivorycoffee.com If you’re a real connoisseur, you might enjoy designing your own coffee blend. De’Longhi coffee partner eightpointnine is the only post-roast coffee blending company operating a bespoke blending and home-delivery service in the UK. It sources its coffee from the finest plantations in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Sumatra. As well as allowing customers to create (and name) their own blends, eightpointnine is launching a series of blends with De’Longhi from mid-October. Register your new bean-to-cup machine with the De'Longhi Coffee Club to become a “Coffee Explorer” and receive a free month’s supply of coffee. Coffee-shop culture – and in particular the rise of the artisan coffee shop – has raised awareness of unusual premium blends With a reputation as an excellent brew, Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, named after the area in which it is grown, produces the equivalent of just 0.1 per cent of Colombia’s total coffee output. The Peaberry, meanwhile, is an even rarer whole coffee bean that is harvested from the same trees and amounts to a mere five per cent of Blue Mountain’s coffee harvest. Said to have a more concentrated flavour, you can buy it for £16 per 125g from Sea Island Coffee or, for a quarter of the price – £8 per 250g – Whittard offers a medium-to-light roasted Kenya Peaberry , grown in the rich red soils surrounding the extinct volcano, Mount Kenya. It's bright and citrusy notes are a contrast to the smooth, herby tones of Blue Mountain. If you’re feeling brave, why not try the world’s strongest coffee? Death Wish Coffee , adorned appropriately with a skull and crossbones, was created by a New York coffee shop owner after his customers kept asking for a stronger cup. With 200 per cent more caffeine than your average cup, the disclaimer reads: “This is not your regular morning coffee. This is not your store-bought coffee. You will not find this coffee at your local diner or at your sissy Starbucks.” Confident in the quality and flavour of their dark roast blend, if you’re not happy they even offer a full refund. Sea Island Coffee specialises in bringing rare and unusual coffees to the public. There’s even a section for “wild animal coffee” where, alongside Kopi Luwak, you can try Wild Bat Coffee from Costa Rica and Jacu Bird Coffee from Brazil. Or try the gift set taster collection containing their best-selling Kopi Luwak, Jamaica Blue Mountain and St Helena coffee – a bean produced on a small, mountainous island in the South Atlantic Ocean and processed with pure spring water, £40.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:53:54.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
