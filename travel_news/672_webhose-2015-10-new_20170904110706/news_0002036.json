Water For Life has partnered with Sawyer to provide Personal MINI water filters for pledges that provide Family filters to suffering families, through Indiegogo . In its first few days, Water For Life has already achieved its initial goal of $25,000 to deliver 500 filters to Cambodia and is working on securing funds to send filters to Kenya and India as additional goals. \"Clean water is a basic human need, but not available to 1.4 billion people around the world,\" says Water for Life founder, Rudy Shaffer . \"I have traveled to many countries where children are in desperate need of safe drinking water. This high-tech filter is a sustainable solution to supply clean, safe drinking water and directly affects the children that are dying each day from water borne diseases. We see the immediate difference and impact in people's lives from this amazing technology.\"The Personal MINI filters available in the campaign are perfect for hiking, camping, traveling and for emergency use during natural disasters. These are the lightest, smallest and most efficient water filters on the planet. Each Personal MINI filter can purify up to 100,000 gallons of clean drinking water from any freshwater lake, river or stream, filtering out 99.9 percent of water borne diseases. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:51:18.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
