Impossible? Not if you board the Key West Express at either Fort Myers Beach or Marco Island. While the high-speed ferry skims the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, you relax and enjoy the sunshine and scenery. So, the old saying, \"Getting there is half the fun,\" really is true! \nTravel to Key West used to be limited to either driving the Oversea Highway to Key West or flying into Key West International Airport . While the Oversea Highway is a beautiful drive, the historic highway that stretches from Miami to Key West can become clogged with heavy traffic. While the drive from Miami usually takes less than four hours, those traveling from Southwest Florida may find the trip likely taking a day out of their vacation... each way. \nTaking the Key West Express is as easy as parking your car and boarding the large catamaran. You may choose from traveling in air conditioned comfort inside or soak up the sunshine on the outside deck. A completely stocked galley and bar are available as are large flat-screened TVs with satellite television. \nConsidering the price of gasoline for the one-way 300 mile trip from Fort Myers to Key West, the current round trip Key West Express fare of $146.00 ($81 for children ages 5 - 12 and $136 for seniors over age 62) is reasonable. One-way tickets are available for $86 for adults and seniors and $58 for children (5-12). Children under age five pay only applicable fees and surcharges. Discounted advance tickets are available for weekday travel. Special fares are available for groups of 15 or more.

When making your reservations, you can plan to stay over in Key West and come back a different day â€” simply reserve your return date. When boarding, each passenger is allowed two small carry-on bags or pay an additional fee for larger luggage. Arrangements can also be made to take along your bicycle. Additionally, the crew can accommodate disabled passengers and their wheelchairs or ECVs. \nThe Key West Express even has limited space for your dog. Simply pack Fido in an approved kennel and reserve space for an additional charge. What can't you take with you on the Key West Express ferry? Your car or motorcycle.
