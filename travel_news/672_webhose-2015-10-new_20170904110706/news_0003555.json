Over the past five years (2009-2014), the number of overseas visitors coming to London has risen by 22.5 per cent. \nThe national picture is also positive with 9.9 million international visitors coming to the UK between April and June 2015, five per cent more than the same period last year. Over half of these international visits to the UK were to London. Tourist spending across the UK over this period was £5.8 billion, a seven per cent increase compared with the second quarter of 2014. \nThe latest figures follow on from a record-breaking 2014 when 17.4 million overseas visitors travelled to London, spending £11.8 billion across the city’s restaurants, hotels and attractions. Earlier this year the capital was named the most popular tourist destination in the world for the second year running by MasterCard in the Global Cities Index report. According to the report, London is forecast to host 18.82 million international visitors in 2015 putting the city ahead of Bangkok and Paris. \nThe Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, welcomed the figures. He said: “These numbers prove that our great capital is without a doubt the best place on earth to visit. People come from around the world to experience our unique mix of history, culture, shopping and world-class events. With our spectacular Autumn season of culture and the Rugby World Cup having put London in the spotlight once again, we’ll undoubtedly be welcoming even more tourists to London in the months ahead.\" \nGordon Innes, CEO at London & Partners, the capital’s official promotional organization adds: “The positive figures for the second quarter of 2015 bode well for another year of strong visitor numbers and spend across the city’s museums and art galleries, attractions, restaurants and hotels. As VisitLondon.com we constantly look for new ways to build and grow the city’s tourism offer which supports tens of thousands of jobs across the capital. That work includes innovative campaigns promoting London to the world such as the launch of London’s Autumn Season of Culture and our hugely successful Guest of Honor campaign.” \nThe IPS figures show that London’s popularity is going from strength to strength, with increasing numbers of visitors coming to London each year to attend the capital’s calendar of world-class exhibitions, visit the city’s famous landmarks, enjoy its diverse culture, and watch major sporting events. \nLondon’s Autumn Season of blockbuster exhibitions, including Cosmonauts: Birth of the Space Age at the Science Museum and Crime Museum Uncovered at the Museum of London, are expected to attract many thousands of international visitors. The city’s major events are also drawing significant numbers of tourists. Earlier this year the capital hosted the annual cycling event Prudential RideLondon, and over the last month has welcomed some of the biggest matches of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In January 2016, the city will add another major event to its calendar with the free outdoor light festival, Lumiere London. This is the first event of its kind to take place in the capital and will feature a stunning array of light installations, to be enjoyed by Londoners and visitors alike.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:37:53.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
