The training is being done under the United National Development Program (UNDP)/Uganda Tourism Board project in support of inclusive markets in tourism. \nPeter Miles, UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) International Consultant for inclusive markets, conducted the initial session at the Metropole Hotel in Kampala on October 7. He said: “Without proper preparation for exhibiting, it is unlikely that first-time exhibitors will get any business. They have to understand that the World Travel Market is where buyers and sellers meet to negotiate tourism business. This means package tours and itineraries need to be designed to match the latest tourism trends and profiles of viable tourism markets.” \nThe training covered an overview of international arrivals and expenditure, visitor and exhibitor statistics, pre-exhibition planning and preparation, planning itineraries, the role of intermediaries and the tour operator/wholesaler, measuring exhibition success, social media platforms, and branding at WTM. \nIn recent years, signs demonstrate that focusing on training for exhibitions prior to exhibitions is beginning to pay off since Uganda recorded its best performance at the ITB Travel Exhibition in Berlin, Germany, coming third among African exhibitors in 2012 and most recently edging out her East African neighbors Rwanda, Kenya, and Tanzania to become best exhibitor at this year’s INDABA 2015 Tourism Expo in Durban, South Africa. \nThis is why the Uganda Tourism Board, armed with proven confidence, is keen to raise its profile on both the domestic and international scenes by adding the Pearl of Africa Tourism Expo - Kampala on the East Africa events calendar from November 17-20, 2015. \nTourism Excellence Awards shall be the highlight where the rewards of training and capacity building shall be evidenced. As the saying goes, the proof of the pudding is in its tasting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:02:24.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
