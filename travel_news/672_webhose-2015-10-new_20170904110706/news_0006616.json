At the time of her trial, stories circulated that as a child she would kill birds so she could hold funerals. “There were stories about her killing (sister) Emma’s kittens, stories about decapitated cats. Outlandish stories,” said author Michael Martins. Lizzie and Emma were among the top donors to animal-welfare groups in Fall River. In her will, Lizzie left $30,000 to the Animal Rescue League of Fall River. That bequest continues to help animals today.\n— The Borden slayings were not the first on that block of Second Street. In 1848 in the house next door (which still stands), the wife of Andrew Borden’s brother Lodowick threw her three children into a cistern, killing two of them. She then killed herself.\n— To escape the pressures of Fall River, Lizzie often would take off for Washington, D.C. “Things were getting bad, so I’ve run away,” she wrote to friends. Martins said that in Washington “she could live a life without being publicly scrutinized. She loved theater, loved traveling, loved shopping.”\n— Lizzie and her older sister had a falling out in 1904. Emma moved out, and the two never spoke again. The reason for the split is unknown. The two died nine days apart in 1927.\n— The Borden death scene photos, long heralded as groundbreaking in the field of criminal investigation, aren’t what they seem. The bodies of Andrew and Abby had been moved, examined and relocated before the photographers arrived.\n———\n©2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Lizzie+Borden+facts%3A+She+loved+animals%2C+for+one+thing"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:03:12.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
