Geoff Lewis, from Shropshire, won the men’s competition and Bristol’s Brenda Oxford prevailed in the women’s – to complete an epic golfing journey that has featured nearly 600 golf clubs in the UK and 25,000 amateur golfers. From a starting point of 780 qualifying club medal competitions earlier this year and through a series of four regional finals, 16 players – eight men and eight women – reached the grand final at the spectacular Old Head Golf Links, perched on a promontory reaching out from the southern coastline of Ireland’s County Cork, near Kinsale. “There is not anywhere else in world golf like Old Head,” said Sam Torrance, captain of the 2002 European Ryder Cup team, who added his inimitable charm to the two-day event. “With sea views on every hole, building this course was an incredible achievement.” Geoff Lewis from Shropshire took the men's title The 18-hole stroke-play final was not straightforward either, even with the help of local caddies, as 20mph winds ensured the stunning, rocky cliff edges were an ever-present danger to a stray ball. “We have five par-threes and so the wind plays a significant factor on those holes,” said Danny Brassil, director of golf at Old Head. “Golfers don’t receive any protection from the wind here. You really need to get off to a good start because the golf course does not get any easier as you go along.” Lewis played the course exactly the way the conditions demanded. “I had the mindset that I was not going to lose the golf ball,” said the technician, after his one-ball round. “If I didn’t fancy a shot I didn’t take it on. I laid up if necessary, and if that meant I was walking off some holes with bogey, I knew I would still have a chance.” I’ll never forget this. I won’t be able to – this cup is going on top of the telly Lewis posted a net 75, three over par, to win by two shots from Brian Porteous, from Bearsden Golf Club near Glasgow. It was that shrewd course management that saw Lewis finish runner-up in the Wales & South West regional final on the 2010 Ryder Cup course at Celtic Manor, which was where Oxford also qualified for the final as runner-up. Oxford shot a net 79 – seven over par – at Old Head and edged out Kate Dunham from Clandon Regis Golf Club, who also shot 79 but was runner-up after a back-nine countback. A retired school resource manager, Oxford says the key for her is staying relaxed when the pressure is on. “My weakness used to be my head getting in my own way – thinking too much over each shot. Brenda Oxford from Bristol was the top woman \"My pro always says to me: ‘It’s only a game, don’t worry so much, don’t beat yourself up.’” Torrance presented the silver cups to the winners, who will both receive a set of custom-fitted Callaway clubs. “Events like this are great for the game,” adds Torrance, who has played more European Tour events than any other golfer. “Just being here today, all 16 finalists are winners. It’s a fantastic competition.” The Old Mutual Wealth Golf Challenge has made its mark. “I’ll never forget this,” said Lewis. “In fact I won’t be able to – this cup is going on top of the telly. • Discover more about the Old Mutual Wealth Golf Challenge »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:15:35.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
