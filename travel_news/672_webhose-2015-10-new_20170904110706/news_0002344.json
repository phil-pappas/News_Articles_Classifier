Martin’s art is known for her commitment to abstraction, and her soft-spoken oeuvre evolved in the milieu of Abstract Expressionism and minimalist tendencies. In the 1960s, Martin’s artistic vocabulary concentrated on horizontal and vertical lines that structure the surface in grid fashion or subdivide it into stripes – almost exclusively on square canvases and sheets of paper and working with pencilled lines and a reduced palette of delicate grey and chromatic tones. Through this reduction and concentration, Martin developed a pictorial universe of overwhelming richness, one that offers mesmerizing visual experiences to the patient eye.\nEarly on in her artistic career, Martin won the recognition of New York’s male-dominated art scene. The artist, however, spent most of her life in the solitude of New Mexico.\nThe exhibit is a collaboration of the Tate Modern, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.\nK20 Grabbeplatz is one of three art institutions and exhibit venues in Düsseldorf that house the art collection of the State of North-Rhine Westphalia (Kunstsammlung NRW). In 2011, Kunstsammlung NRW acquired a painting by Martin for its permanent collection. It has since been presented in the “American Gallery” (Robert Rademacher Galerie) along with works by her contemporaries Jackson Pollock, Ellsworth Kelly, Franz Kline, Ad Reinhardt, and Mark Rothko.\n on the retrospective, please visit http://www.kunstsammlung.de .\nDüsseldorf’s tourism office is offering hotel and city specials for stays in 2015.
