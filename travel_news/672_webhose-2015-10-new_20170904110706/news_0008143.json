The 90 minute finale episode was filmed in New Zealand and will be viewed by over 1.4 million Australians this Thursday.”\nChina continues to go from strength to strength achieving a 40.5 per cent increase in holiday arrivals year on year. Tourism New Zealand’s work with tourism ambassador celebrity Huang Lei, Chinese New Year and Golden week celebrations have all contributed to strengthening this market.\nTourism New Zealand’s prioritised market of India has seen another month of staggering holiday arrivals up 23.9 per cent for the year.\n“Earlier this month Tourism New Zealand announced Bollywood star Sidharth Malhotra as New Zealand’s tourism ambassador for India.\n“The popular young actor experienced his first taste of New Zealand earlier this month sharing his experiences with his social media following of over 4.3 million and generating significant interest in India,” says Kevin.\nGrowth has been further supported by strong holiday arrivals across Tourism New Zealand’s other prioritised Asian markets with Japan up 14.9 per cent, Singapore up 12.9 per cent, Malaysia up 12.4 per cent and Korea up 20 per cent.\nArrival figures for the markets of the US and Germany have again shown significant growth, with holiday arrivals for Germany up 9.7 per cent and the US arrivals up 14.4 per cent on the same period last year. The UK continues to see growth, up 9.8 per cent.\nSource:- Tourism New Zealand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:41:38.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
