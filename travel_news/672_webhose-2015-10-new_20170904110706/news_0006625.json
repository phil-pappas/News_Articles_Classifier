They will then rebook the later flight, subject to availability, and a new e-ticket will be issued. \nFor day-return journeys, on-the-day changes can be made to the outbound and/or return flight. \nLast month, Flybe called for APD to be scrapped entirely or “dramatically reduced” in an open letter to chancellor George Osborne.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:36:27.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
