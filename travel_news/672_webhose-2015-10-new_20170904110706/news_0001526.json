Russian experts said it was a smaller area, and Ukrainians indicated a smaller area still. \nThe DSB did not set out to find who fired the missile. That will be dealt with by prosecutors later. \nRussian missile-makers have carried out their own investigation which they say point to Ukrainian fighters being to blame. \nAfter the findings were released, Prime Minister David Cameron, said: “We have always been clear that justice must be done for all of the victims of MH17 and today’s report brings us one step closer to establishing the truth. \n“We, alongside our partners, will continue to send a clear message; those responsible for downing this plane will be held to account.” \nBarry Sweeney, whose son Liam, 28, was on board, said he had been told that the passengers would have died soon after impact. \nHe told the BBC: “That is a comfort for 298 sets of relatives.” \nThey wanted to know their loved ones had not suffered. “We cannot be 100%, but we have to think that was the case,” he said. \nHe added: “I’m going to have to go away and think ‘Yes, Liam died instantly as (did) 297 other people’. If you think otherwise, it’s just going to hurt forever.” \nLiam was travelling with his friend and fellow Newcastle United superfan John Alder to watch their side play pre-season games in New Zealand. \nMr Sweeney believed his son was “probably having a drink” as the plane flew high over Ukraine, and would have been excited. \n“It was the trip of a lifetime, unfortunately they didn’t get there,” Mr Sweeney said. \nThe investigation was led by Holland because 196 of the victims were Dutch. \nThe MH17 disaster followed on from the disappearance in March last year of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 237 passengers on board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:38:10.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
