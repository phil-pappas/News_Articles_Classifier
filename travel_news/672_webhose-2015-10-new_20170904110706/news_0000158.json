Camera Equipment \nWith camera gear, my ultimate goal is to be as efficient and low-key as possible with my setup. It’s hard to have an authentic experience when you’re walking around with tons of camera gear. \nBefore this trip I purchased the Sony Alpha a7II Mirrorless Digital Camera (with the 28-70mm kit lens) to go along with my Canon S120 and GoPro Hero4 Black 4k. I also replaced an old tripod with the Manfrotto 60″ Compact Action Tripod , Joby Gorillapod and a small pocket-size tripod for the point-and-shoot. \nI also added the Zoom H2n Handy Recorder for voiceovers, the Rode lavalier microphone to improve audio, and a great pair of LSTN Headphones to hear it all. \nI carry all my batteries, chargers, memory cards, and GoPro gear in a compact Contour Case . \nNot Pictured: iPhone 5s (primary phone) and iPod shuffle (exercise). Computer / Memory / Notes \nThe 15″ MacBook Pro that I bought in Ecuador ( read this ) is still going strong (knock on wood), and I carry a LaCie 2TB Rugged External Hard Drive and small Samsung 1TB portable hard drive. \n*I need to start bringing more memory, as I always run out of space somewhere along the trip. \nAlong with all that flashy technology gear, I pack at least three notebooks with me; one for my OCD-driven need for “To-Do” Lists, another to keep a journal of plans and events, and several pocket-sized pads for on-the-go ideas and thoughts (highly recommended). Accessories \nI go through sunglasses like they’re chewing gum, so I bring two pairs of cheap shades (both lost/broken at this point), two LED Headlamp , G-Shock watch, water bottle, bottle opener, lock and TSA approved locks , wallet, passport, business cards, lots of pens, and any necessary paperwork – on this trip it was the Active Adventures EBC itinerary and gear list. Toiletries \nThe most essential items in this category are the Mitchum deodorant and baby powder . If you’re a man and don’t utilize these two products, especially for long travel days, I don’t agree with your lifestyle. \nOther notable items include a small first-aid kit, beard trimmer, athletic tape, hair paste (3 years old), and travel-size bottles of soap, shampoo and cologne. \nAnother travel must-have is a small bottle of Downy wrinkle releaser . I hang my clothes in the bathroom during a hot shower (steam) and then add this stuff, and it works like magic (for wrinkles and smells). \nJust because you’re traveling doesn’t mean you have to look like a backpacker. Clothing \nI go heavy on the t-shirts, throw in a few henleys and button downs, one pair of jeans, two pairs of chinos (more comfortable for walking and travel), one bathing suit, black socks, a baseball hat, a belt, a MicroDry Towel , and an ankle brace (ball is life). \nThe most important item in my suitcase is without question, my Exofficio Boxer Briefs . I swear by them. \nThey’re like a cool summer breeze running through your crotch all day. Trust me. \nFor this trip, I also packed a lot more dry-fit clothing than usual because cotton doesn’t mix well with long days of sweating. \n*Clint loves the Icebreaker shirts for traveling, and they seemed to hold up great during the trek (he didn’t smell that bad). I need to invest in a few of them. \nAnother tip for all the gentleman travelers out there – black v-neck t-shirts are great for any situation. You can wear them in a nightclub or for a run – I highly recommend throwing one or two in your bag. Just don’t let your “V” dip too low. Hiking Gear \nThese are the items that I purchased in Kathmandu. Thanks to the advice of past trekkers and the Active Adventures staff, we were able to get a bunch of good quality hiking gear for a fraction of the price – Including: North Face* rain suit, waterproof bag (used for my camera), SmartWool* socks, two trekking pants and a Salomon* fleece – all this for $150 USD. \n*Brand authenticity is just a logo away. \nNot Pictured: I purchased thin pair of gloves and winter running hat at Target before leaving and then purchased down mittens during the trek in Dingboche ( video proof ). Shoes \nShoes take up the most weight in the suitcase so I try to pack only what I really need. Depending on the trip, I might also bring a pair of dress shoes and/or basketball sneaks as well. Whenever possible, I buy shoes when I’m at my final destination. \nFor this Everest trip, it was crucial to research, purchase, and break-in hiking boots a few months before we arrived, so I went with a pair of Vasque St. Elias GTX . \nI have to say, I was very disappointed. After two months of breaking them in, I still had to tape up my toes on the trek to avoid serious blisters. They were durable and waterproof, but you would think for the price, they would be more comfortable. Luggage & Bags \n. I’ve been using it for the past five years and it’s still in great shape. All my computer gear goes in the Ogio backpack, and I use the Altosy 40L Hiking Pack for day trips (and trekking). New Additions \nSince the last adventure, I upgraded a few items in my arsenal, including a new computer bag and the Rode Shotgun Video Mic . \nThe beautifully simple design of The Idle Man’s C6 Pocket Backpack makes this the perfect addition for urban adventures. Its compact, super comfortable, and I might even be able to trick people into thinking I’m stylish with this fresh piece. \nAs for the Rode Mic, a friend smuggled it into Turkey for me a few months back and I used it to film the Walks of Turkey video series . It’s great for picking up dialog as well as ambient noise – big improvement. Wish List \nWhile I am pretty happy with my current travel setup, there are a few things I’d like to add to the lot. \nDepending on the location of the next adventure, I’d love to invest in a steady cam, a few more GoPro accessories, a portable battery charger , and another lens for the Sony A7ii (70-200?). \nI also want to get my hands on a drone, but that would completely throw off my strategy of being as efficient and low-key as possible. Maybe I can pick one up for some state-side videos next year : ) —– What am I missing? \n*Please note some of these products contain affiliate links but that comes at no cost to you.
