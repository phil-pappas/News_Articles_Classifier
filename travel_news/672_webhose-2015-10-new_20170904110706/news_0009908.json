(Reuters)\nYou may want to start packing your bags.\nNorwegian Air says it plans to sell one-way tickets from Europe to the United States for as little as $69, according to Reuters .\nA round-trip fare would be more like $300, the airline's CEO, Bjørn Kjos, told Reuters. That's still about $200 cheaper than the airline's current fare for a round-trip transatlantic flight.\nKjos said the fares would be possible because there are U.S .airports with low fees, such as New York's Winchester County Airport and Connecticut's Bradley International Airport, because they have little to no international service.\n\"I think you will see a lot to that effect within five years' time,\" Kjos told Reuters . \"What will happen to (Lufthansa) when everyone starts to fly direct?\"\nIt's not yet clear where the flights will originate from. The airline said that while no decisions have been made on which U.K. airports to include, its existing operations at Gatwick, Manchester, Edinburgh and Birmingham would \"naturally be the first destinations to consider operating from,\" according to The Telegraph .\nSeveral budget airlines have tried to break into the transatlantic market recently. Earlier this year, Ryanair said it could offer one-way flights across the Atlantic for as low as £10 . And, Iceland's Wow Air now offers one-way tickets between Boston and Paris for $99.", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/16/ryanair-plans-to-offer-flights-between-europe-and-america", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/06/us-norwegian-air-fares-idUSKCN0S02YF20151006", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/11916191/Norwegian-Air-plans-69-flights-to-Europe-from-US.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:59:47.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
