I think the cruise ships in particular (have made a differerence). I believe since 2012 there's been over a 70% increase in cruise ships coming to the island so it couldn't be better.\n– Luke Wheadon, Chamber of Commerce Tourism and Hospitality sub-group 20% Passenger increase since 2014 But for local businesses, feelings are mixed on whether cruise ships do benefit the tourist industry.\nAt Sausmarez Manor, Peter de Sausmarez believes that the cruise passengers do help.\nI think since they moved the landing spot to by the bus stop that's produced a great deal more adventurous passengers who have ventured further into the island and some of them have come here and some of them have gone on to some of the other attractions and not just got stuck in St Peter Port.\n– Peter de Sausmarez, Sausmarez Manor However, at Guernsey's Occupation Museum owner Richard Heaume doesn't agree.\nHe says he sees some extra visitors when a cruise ship is in but restricted numbers in the museum and the need to offer discounts means there's no financial benefit.\nRichard would prefer the States encouraged more visitors in the quieter tourism periods.\nLast updated Thu 8 Oct 2015 Travel Guernsey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:37:38.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
