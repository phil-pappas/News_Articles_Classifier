Furthermore, the weaker yen boosted revenue figures from airline tickets sold in foreign currencies. \nANA Holdings is expected to report a record operating profit for the six months through September, with Chinese and Southeast Asian visitors to Japan a boon for international routes. \nOperating profit for the interim half apparently rose nearly 50% on the year to around 85 billion yen ($697 million), an all-time high for the period. Lower fuel costs resulting from the drop in crude oil prices also provided a boost. \nThe operator of All Nippon Airways likely grew sales 5% to roughly 900 billion yen. The launch of new routes from Tokyo's Narita Airport to Houston and Kuala Lumpur helped to increase international service. \nDomestic operations took a hit from the opening of a bullet train service connecting Tokyo and Kanazawa, a regional hub to the northwest. Yet business traffic was strong and the use of smaller planes improved margins. \nFor the full year through March, ANA forecasts operating profit rising 26% to 115 billion yen. Results may come in even higher, considering plans for additional flights between Tokyo's Haneda Airport and various Chinese cities in the second half.
