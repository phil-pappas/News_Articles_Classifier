The theme park has teamed up with video-game creators Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) and PopCap Games to open Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare: 3Z Arena , billed as the world's first \"intra-active\" 3-D game experience, according to a news release . The new attraction is set to open in spring 2016. Carowinds is about to get a little more digital with the addition of a 3-D gaming… more Grant Baldwin The nearly 3,600-square-foot arena will be equipped with 3-D technology, large screens, surround sound, motion-based seats and hand-held laser devices. Teams will compete in a nearly five-minute backyard battle, shooting screens with blasters and tracking their scores. The attraction, which will be located in the County Fair section of Carowinds, will run about 10 times each hour to accommodate between 600 and 700 players. “ Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare: 3Z Arena is another example of how Carowinds is committed to bringing unique and innovative experiences that the entire family can enjoy together,” said Mike Fehnel , Carowinds' vice president and general manager, in the news release. “This wildly popular brand has such a universal appeal and aligns perfectly with our promise to deliver the best day experience ever.” The gaming attraction is based off the Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare franchise, where players use plants to block zombies from getting through to \"suburbia.\" It will be exclusive to Carowinds, which straddles the Carolinas border off Interstate 77 south of Charlotte. The franchise is launching in spring 2016 a new Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 edition, with new features and characters. “We’re always striving to create new and unique ways for people to experience the Plants vs. Zombies universe,” said Jeremy Vanhoozer , senior creative director. “Our franchise is all about creating fun moments and doing things differently. This first-ever interactive Garden Warfare attraction from Carowinds will be unlike anything people have seen before and we can’t wait for them to experience it next spring.” Carowinds, owned by Ohio-based Cedar Fair Entertainment Co. (NYSE:FUN), is the Charlotte region's top tourist attraction with nearly 2 million visitors in 2014. The park is in the midst of a makeover that started in late 2013 and involves more than $50 million in improvements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:19:47.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
