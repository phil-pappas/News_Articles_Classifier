In some ways, though, it is conversation about routines and normalcy that therapeutically forces us to persevere and return to a daily existence. Most conversation the past few days has opened with the question, “Did you have flooding?” Sitting in a recliner for five days and watching it rain can add perspective, but unless your own house is damaged, it doesn’t mean as much. When the sun finally came out this week, we returned to work. But it was then we also saw soaked carpet piled up at the curb and the overfilled trucks hauling debris. We learned of friends who could only leave their neighborhoods by boat and others who were afraid to turn on the electricity because AC units had been sitting in 4 feet of water. Rain, rain go away When churches are forced to cancel Sunday services, you know the rain is falling in historical, if not Biblical, proportions. And yet, all many of us could do was watch. My house lost power for maybe an hour that Saturday night. It meant I couldn’t watch the third quarter of the Clemson-Notre Dame game. It was inconvenient, but hardly something that should be mentioned in the scheme of things. By that time, a community of homes less than a mile from my front door had water rising in their dens almost as high as their mounted big-screen TVs. Their “down and distance” concerns were far more significant. I found myself thinking of the Johns Island folks who had recently been in the path of the tornado. Those blue tarps on their roofs couldn’t have provided much protection from the rain. And after so much effort to pick up and clean up, they were now mopping up. I don’t care how much of an old-timer you consider yourself to be, nobody’s ever seen it rain like this before. Tomorrow, tomorrow So here we are, waterlogged and trying to figure out if even more water may eventually make its way here via broken dams or bloated rivers. The crumbling sheetrock and fallen oak trees will continue to pile up for removal. Roofers will have enough work to keep them busy through the holidays. Insurance adjusters will keep checking off their stops and prioritizing their claimants. Carpet and hardwood floor installers won’t need to worry about finding any customers. We all may squeak a little when we walk for a few more days. Somehow, we’ll get through it. We always do. Once again, the eyes of the nation are fixed on this little state. I wonder how a state so relatively small in size and population garners so much attention, both for good things and bad. What we always seem to figure out is that the best thing we can do is roll up our sleeves and go to work. We help each other, we comfort each other, we provide for each other. How poignant the political cartoon on the editorial page showing the crescent moon and palmetto tree with water more than halfway up the trunk. That symbol of resilience remains, and you know what? The sun is now shining and the water is going down. There’s a chance in nine months some local hospitals will notice an increase in newborns. Let’s hope the most popular boy’s name isn’t Noah.
