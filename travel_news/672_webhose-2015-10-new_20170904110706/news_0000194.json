(AP) — Two former CNN journalists are suing Motel 6, saying one of the budget chain's Albuquerque inns didn't do enough to ensure their safety the night a man tried to rob them and an exchange of gunfire ensued.\nChuck de Caro and Lynne Russell also argue Motel 6's famous motto — \"We'll leave the lights on for you\" — misrepresented the dangers at the Albuquerque location and contributed to a false sense of security when they checked into their room for a night's stay in June.\n\"All I can say is we were under the impression we were in a safe place and it turned out we were not,\" Russell said Friday. \"This is a story of disappointment and misplaced trust.\"\nMotel 6 did not return a request for comment responding to the lawsuit.\nDe Caro and Russell, of West Virginia, contend that had the motel implemented 24-hour, real-time monitoring of surveillance cameras, staff could have stopped the intruder before he reached the couple's room.\nSurveillance video showed Tomorio Walton, a 27-year-old convicted felon, forcing his way into the room and spending about seven minutes inside.\nThe Motel 6 where the couple stayed is a \"haven for crime,\" and officers have responded hundreds of times to calls at the location in the last five years, said Randi McGinn, the couple's attorney.\nCourt records show the couple's complaint was filed Tuesday in New Mexico district court in Albuquerque.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:03:20.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
