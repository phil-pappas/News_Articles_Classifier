In the summer timetable announced later today no less than five new destinations will appear.Although winter is coming up, the temperatures are already rising at Brussels Airlines. The company’s strategy to include popular vacation regions in its flight offer continues in 2016.\n \nBrussels Airlines adds five new destinations and many extra flight frequencies to existing destinations in the summer offer, which can already be booked as from tomorrow.Tourist attractions such as the Greek Crete and the South Spanish Jerez are added to the summer offer. With Belfast Brussels Airlines also expands her network to Northern Ireland. Tenerife and Las Palmas / Gran Canaria – two routes that are launched this winter season – are also offered during the summer season. An overview:\n \nJerez \n \nSherry wine, tapas and flamenco… Numerous ingredients of the Andalusian culture and gastronomy have their roots in Jerez de la Frontera. With Jerez, Brussels Airlines adds one of the most attractive South-Spanish cities to its network. More and more tourists visit the city and its surroundings each year. Wine tasters will be delighted to visit the well-known Sherry bodegas and wine cellars of Tio Pepe, Domecq or William Hubert. Horse lovers will relish the famous Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Ecuestre. Motor freaks can attend one of the many races at the F1-circuit located nearby.\n \nJerez is at the same time the perfect base for those who want to visit the coastal areas surrounding Cadiz and Puerto de Santa Maria or Pueblos Blancos in the mountains. Also the golf courses and luxury hotels of Novo Sancti Petro / Sciclana and Rota – which is very popular amongst Belgians – are just a stone’s throw away from Jerez.\n \nJerez is Brussels Airlines’ third destination in Andalusia. There are several flights a day to Malaga and Seville is served several times a week. Right across the border of Portugal Brussels Airlines already flies frequently to Faro. Flights to and from the different airports can be combined so as to make fly & drive holidays in the area possible as well.\n \nThe new route to Jerez de la Frontera starts in May and will last until the end of September. Flights are operated on Wednesdays and Sundays.\n \nSource:-Brussels Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:46:23.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
