Not only do you get a value-for-money holiday at sea, or on one of the world’s great rivers, but you will also have time to stay in or near your departure port and explore the destination properly. The inclusion of a land-based stay will make the holiday less of a gamble for first-time cruisers and offers a perfect compromise for families, couples or travelling companions who can’t decide which type of holiday to take. It’s easy to create your own cruise-and-stay holiday, as demonstrated here, but several companies do the job for you. Thomson Cruises ( thomson.co.uk/cruises ) matches hotels from its stablemate tour companies with voyages from all the ports it sails from in Europe and the Caribbean. Virgin Holidays Cruises ( virginholidayscruises.com ) also offers ready-made cruise-and-stay holidays, likewise travel agents The Cruise Traveller ( thecruisetraveller.co.uk ), Imagine Cruising ( imaginecruising.co.uk ) and Cruise 1st ( cruise1st.co.uk ). Imagine Cruising, whose latest brochure twins river and ocean cruises with stays in North America, Alaska and Dubai among others, has seen a 40 per cent growth for cruise and stay this year. Land tours include African safaris, Niagara Falls and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train. Cruise1st reports strong growth in Asia, where some cruise lines will be basing ships (in Singapore, Shanghai and Hong Kong) from 2016. A 24-night cruise that includes stays in Singapore, Xian and Beijing and visits the Great Wall and Terracotta Army costs from £2,599 per person, including flights. Barbados is the Caribbean's cruising hub 1. Barbados In the first three months of 2015 – peak time for cruising – 100,000 more visitors travelled to Barbados to join a cruise than to stay in one of its hotels, according to the Caribbean Tourism Organisation. But while Barbados is the Caribbean’s cruising hub, the island’s quirky British charm tinged with a West Indies vibe should not be overlooked. It has sandy beaches, good restaurants and luxury hotels that sit well with a six-star cruise. SeaDream Yacht Club ( seadream.com ) and Silversea ( silversea.com ) both have ships in Barbados during the winter. Other cruise lines homeporting in Barbados include Thomson Cruises ( thomson.co.uk/cruises ), Star Clippers ( starclippers.co.uk ), Carnival Cruise Lines ( carnival.co.uk ), Fred Olsen Cruise Lines ( fredolsencruises.com ) and Windstar ( windstarcruises.com ). Pair with... Feeling flush: Arguably the best address on the island, Port Ferdinand ( portferdinand.com ) is a new resort-cum-residential property with two, three and four-bedroom houses set around a marina. If you find it hard to leave, you could always purchase a property (a three-bedroom home costs from US$2.5  million/£1.6  million) but there are also short-stay rental rates (from US$650/£589 per night for a one-bedroom home). On a budget: Bayfield House Hotel ( bayfieldbarbados.com ) is a 10-room family-run hotel on the west coast, close to the beach and with its own swimming pool. Doubles from US$165/£108 per night including breakfast and free Wi-Fi. 2. Cuba MSC Cruises ( msccruises.co.uk ) has new seven-night Caribbean cruises from Havana this winter that include two days in the Cuban capital. That’s long enough to stroll around old Havana, ride in a classic American car and wander along the seafront Malecon, but adding a few days at the end of the cruise will allow time to seek out restaurants and bars at your leisure and visit the Museum of the Revolution – as interesting for its lavish surroundings as for its subject matter. Celestyal Cruises with Cuba Cruise (yourcubacruise.com), Variety Cruises ( varietycruises.com ) and Star Clippers offer voyages from Havana that cruise around Cuba. Pair with... Feeling flush: Havana’s Hotel Saratoga ( hotel-saratoga.com ) is situated in an enviable location that affords a rooftop view across to the Capitol building, the seat of government until after the Cuban revolution in 1959. From US$179/£117 per night. On a budget: Rooms are spartan but what you lose in style you gain in location because Hotel Ambos Mundos ( hotelambosmundos-cuba.com ) is bang in the centre of atmospheric Old Havana. Doubles from £45 per night. A classic Havana street scene 3. Miami Home to the world’s busiest cruise port (4.8 million passengers passed through its terminals last year), Miami, via Fort Lauderdale, is the North American springboard for voyages worldwide, with a focus on the Caribbean and South America. The port is used by 15 cruise companies including Carnival, Celebrity Cruises ( celebritycruises.co.uk ) and Royal Caribbean International ( royalcaribbean.co.uk ). A great option for younger couples, Miami will also appeal to foodies and those with an interest in Art Deco. It is one of those enviable cities that combine a fabulous beach with hip nightlife, sophisticated dining, glamorous hotels and great shopping, making it perfect for those who enjoy city breaks. Other lines based here include Crystal Cruises (crystalcruises.co.uk) and MSC Cruises. From November, Norwegian Cruise Line ( ncl.co.uk ) will have a new ship, Escape, homeported in Miami all year.

Feeling flush: SLS South Beach Hotel ( slshotels.com ) is in the heart of South Beach’s trendy Art Deco district, on the beachfront, and has two pools and dining options ranging from Spanish to Japanese. From £325 per night. On a budget: YVE Hotel ( destinationhotels.com/yve-miami ) is on Bayside Marketplace, a 10-minute drive from Miami Beach. Rooms are simple but contemporary. Doubles from US$220/£144 per night. 4. Orlando The main reason to add a few nights in Orlando to the start or end of a cruise from Port Canaveral (about 45 miles east of the city) is to spend time in the theme parks – making this the perfect family option. A week at Walt Disney World ahead of a three, four or seven-night Caribbean cruise with Disney Cruise Line ( disneycruiseline.co.uk ), is the obvious combination, but there are alternativesl. Royal Caribbean, NCL and Carnival (details above) sail the Caribbean from Port Canaveral – and in Orlando you can visit Universal Studios, SeaWorld or Legoland. Near the port, Kennedy Space Centre tours take you inside the launch room. Pair with... Feeling flush: The Disney Grand Floridian Resort & Spa ( disneyholidays.co.uk ) is at Walt Disney World, just one stop by monorail from the Magic Kingdom. It’s not one for minimalists – think Victoriana, Disney-style. Doubles from £378 per night. On a budget: On International Drive, Wyndham Orlando Resort ( wyndham.com/hotels ) provides a free shuttle to Universal Studios and SeaWorld. Doubles from US$179/£117 per night. 5. Hong Kong Most ships offering turnaround cruises from Hong Kong (where one set of passengers disembarks and another comes on board) are sailing one-off itineraries through Asia to Europe or the Orient. Cruise lines calling at the port include Seabourn ( seabourn.com ), Silversea ( silversea.com ), Cunard ( cunard.co.uk ) and Celebrity. Read more: Hong Kong city guide If you are making the 13-hour journey from the UK to join a cruise, it makes sense to add a few nights in this dynamic East-meets-West Asian metropolis. Safe, and good for exploring independently, the city has extensive, easy-to-use and affordable public transport, not to mention superb restaurants, vibrant markets, scores of temples and quieter, outlying islands to explore. Pair with... Feeling flush: Perfect for special occasions and worth pushing the boat out for, The Peninsula Hong Kong (peninsula.com) on the harbour front in Kowloon is one of Asia’s must-see hotels. The Star Ferry terminal, numerous shopping malls and waterfront museums are within easy walking distance. Even if you don’t stay at The Peninsula, at least pay a visit for its legendary afternoon tea. Doubles from HKD3,480/£295 per night. On a budget: The Novotel Hong Kong ( accorhotels.com ), on Kowloon’s busy Nathan Road, is minutes from Temple Street night market and a stone’s throw from the main shopping district. Doubles from £80 per night. 6. Jamaica Thomson Cruises put Jamaica on the cruise-and-stay map when it chose Montego Bay as the new homeport for Thomson Dream last winter. It works for the British cruise brand on several levels. The port’s location opened up cruise itineraries to Central America, Mexico and Cuba; accommodation is plentiful, the island is popular with UK visitors and there’s plenty to keep them occupied for several days, including beaches, restaurants and activities such as climbing Dunn’s River waterfall or bobsledding down Mystic Mountain. Celestyal, which uses Montego Bay as an alternative port for its Cuba cruises, is among the more cosmopolitan options as it attracts multiple nationalities including Canadians, French and Spanish. Read more: Jamaica Travel Guide Pair with... Feeling flush: Perfect for relaxing with a partner, Sandals Royal Plantation ( sandals.co.uk ) is a 74-suite all-inclusive couples-only property in Ocho Rios. Expect butler service and extensive watersports options. Doubles from £429 per night all-inclusive. On a budget: Palms Resort, Negril ( palmsjamaica.com ) has just 34 rooms on Negril’s Seven-Mile beach. Doubles from US$125/£82 per night.
