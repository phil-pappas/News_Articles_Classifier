Today's savvy hotels are offering over-the-top amenities to make guest-stays more memorable. Check out these perks compiled by the travel experts at The GO Group: \nThe Gwen, A luxury Collection Hotel in Chicago offers a Prohibition Porter who will come to guest's rooms and pour custom made cocktails per request, or one off of the Giggle Juice 1930's cocktail menu featuring classics such as a Gin Rickey or French 75. Also, upon request from the concierge, any guest can have an easel, canvas and vintage paint palettes/supplies delivered to their room or set up in public area in the hotel. \nThe Capella Washinton D.C., offers star gazing lessons. The Constellation Series program features a complimentary tutorial from a University of Maryland astronomy graduate student, who helps guests gaze through telescopes on the hotel's rooftop. \nNew York's The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria, located in the top 14 floors of the venue, lets VIP guests partake of the Top of the Waldorf Rooftop Honey produced in the hotel's six apiaries. Guests also receive recipes incorporating the sweet stuff from the hotel's culinary team and the resident mixologist. \nNo sunburns allowed at the The Ritz-Carlton South Beach, Miami which boasts a Tanning Butler. The butler's job is to patrol the pool deck to help guests apply sunscreen and offer a selection of tanning products, sunglasses and other sun necessities. Thirsty guests also can cool off with crafted concoctions provided by the poolside mixologist on wheels. \nThe SLS Hotel in Beverly Hills has introduced a Saints and Sinners mini-bar. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages as well as treats (unsalted nuts vs. chocolates) are separated into the two halves of the refrigerated unit. If money is no object, book the penthouse suite and dine on cotton candy foie gras and caviar cones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:39:53.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
