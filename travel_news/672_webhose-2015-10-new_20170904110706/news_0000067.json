Don't miss it! \nDufftober fest beer is now at Springfield U.S.A in Universal Studios for a limited time. Don't miss it! Review: Dufftoberfest beer at Universal's Springfield U.S.A. \nEven the once fictional beer made famous in \"The Simpsons\" has jumped aboard the fall beer train. \nDufftoberfest is the first seasonal offering (available through Oct. 31) of Duff Beer at Springfield U.S.A. at Universal Orlando. The area, home of The Simpsons Ride, has been serving up Homer's favorite brand of beer since 2013. \nDufftoberfest joins three full-time signature brews found at both Moe's Tavern and Duff Brewery, a limited-service waterfront bar. According to Bill Young, assistant director of revenue operations at Universal Orlando, Dufftoberfest is a beer two years in the making. \n\"Our fans really enjoy new and diverse experiences, so we're always challenging ourselves to develop products you can't find anywhere else,\" Young told the official Universal blog . \nDufftoberfest isn't as full-bodied as many Oktoberfest (or Octoberfest) or Marzen-style beers and has a slightly lighter copper color than others in the category. \nIt also isn't as rich and toasty as say a Samuel Adams Octoberfest, but it does finish smooth. \nThis actually plays into its favor, as the last thing you usually want at a hot and humid Florida theme park is a heavy beer to slow you down. \nOverall, Dufftoberfest is a great option for the theme park goer looking for something different. It's not too heavy, still flavorful with a hint of caramel, and not too light and water-downed. \nAt $8.51 for a healthy pour, it's on par with most draft beers at theme parks, and is easily a better alternative than staples like Bud and Bud Light. \nBy far, the best thing about Dufftoberfest is ability to drink it in Universal's Springfield, whether it's inside Moe's Tavern or waterfront at Duff Brewery. \nYou could even pair with with a pink icing with sprinkles donut from Lard Lad, something that would surely make Homer go \"Woo-hoo!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:35:32.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
