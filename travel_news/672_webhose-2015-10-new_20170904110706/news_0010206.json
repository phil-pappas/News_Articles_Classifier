It is a highly scalable solution that can support the brake system requirements from A segment cars through to large Sport Utility Vehicles.\nManfred Meyer , vice president, ZF TRW braking systems, commented: \"The Integrated Brake Control system represents the future of braking technology and helps to satisfy the global industry trends of CO 2 efficiency, safety and automated driving. It supports all powertrain configurations and can integrate regenerative braking technology for hybrids and electric vehicles; helps deliver advanced safety in the form of rapid building of brake pressure for high dynamic demands such as automatic emergency braking; and will support the gamut of brake vehicle control and stopping requirements for partially to fully automated driving functions.\"\nAt the heart of the system is an actuator that is driven by a fast acting motor capable of brake pressure builds that translate into up to one g vehicle deceleration in less than 150 milliseconds for significantly reduced stopping distances. This is particularly important when seeking to comply with the stringent new test protocols for EuroNCAP that simulate pedestrian and crossing bicyclists in urban environments.\nIn addition IBC offers packaging and weight advantages, typically weighing about 25-30% lighter than a comparable traditional brake system configuration. This can add additional fuel savings and space savings for vehicle manufacturers.\nZF TRW has deep experience in the design, development and supply of high complexity, powertrain independent electro-mechanical brake control technologies and has been in series production since 2007.\nThe IBC system will launch in high volume in 2018 for a major vehicle manufacturer and supports both traditional braking safety functions as well as partially automated functions.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275266\n releases/zf-trws-innovative-integrated-brake-control-system-to-launch-in-high-volume-in-2018-300156608.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275266", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151008/275266", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zf-trws-innovative-integrated-brake-control-system-to-launch-in-high-volume-in-2018-300156608.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DE23469&Transmission_Id=201510080930PR_NEWS_USPR_____DE23469&DateId=20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:22.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
