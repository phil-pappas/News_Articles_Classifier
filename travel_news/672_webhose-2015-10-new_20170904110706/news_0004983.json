Rutter said in a statement that the Pope's \"visionarymessage advocating tolerance and understanding for others communicates an ideal shared by all of us at the Kennedy Center.\" \nThe program will include portions of Mozart's \"Exsultate, jubilate\" and Holst's \"The Planets\" (the movement \"Venus, the Bringer of Peace\"), as well as Cesar Franck's \"Panis angelicus.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:31:07.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
