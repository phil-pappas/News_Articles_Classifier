All opinions are 100% mine. It’s quite interesting to think of what the future can behold for travelers. What kind of new gadgets will be invented, renovated, or upgraded What will people consider when planning their next vacation abroad? As it so happens, in a new survey brought to you by the stellar guys behind the Marriott Rewards Credit Card from Chase , they asked Americans to predict what the travel experience could look like in the year 2030. From unique travel experiences to putting the real in virtual reality, the top predictions reveal some unique surprises. What will the future have in store for travelers? Did you know that about seventy-one percent of travelers who participated in the survey agree that Americans will choose “eco-travel” destinations for vacations? This doesn’t surprise me. With the rise of global warming and the awareness for change in our daily lives, the new generation of millennial travelers recognize the need to protect our local environment. If we fail to protect the fragile ecosystems around us, going on adventures such as the Gibbon Experience or treks through the Costa Rican rainforest could come to a screeching halt. And taking experience like this could change altogether in the future as well. Nearly half (47 percent) of all travelers who took this survey believe personalized mobile travel guides will become available in the future. Can you picture that? You’re essentially going on a self-guided tour with your phone or iPad in hand as a guide. This could drastically improve (or decrease) the experience, depending on your outlook of the changes and how it’s implemented. Fancy sleeping with the fishes? Among travel experiences of the future, 40 percent think underwater hotels might become more of a reality in the next 15 years. In fact, this is already a possibility for people who have the check book to do so. For a mere $1,500 a night, India will soon be surfacing a resort that allows you to sleep, essentially, an a giant bubble surrounded by an coral reef! All of these studies and more can be found on the infographic if you’re more visibly entertained: If you happen to be planning a trip in the future, you may want to do so by using a specific credit card that offers good perks.
