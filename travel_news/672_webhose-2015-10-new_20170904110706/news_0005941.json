They are scheduled at the tour desk at the front entrance of the building between 8:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday through Friday. \nThe tours begin on the first floor in the rotunda of Kentucky's fourth permanent capitol building since statehood in 1792. It is the multi-purpose room of the Capitol, serving as the site of public rallies, news conferences and inaugural balls since 1922. \nDenny informs visitors that the Capitol was designed by architect Frank Mills Andrews in the neoclassical Beaux-Arts style. The rotunda contained no statues until Abraham Lincoln's was placed there. It now has five. The others are statesman Henry Clay, frontier surgeon Ephraim McDowell, former vice president Alben Barkley and the controversial Confederate President Jefferson Davis. \nHighlighting the rotunda is the dome, the apex of which is 180 feet — or about 18 stories — from the floor. The dome was inspired by the one that rises above Napoleon's tomb in the Hotel des Invalides in Paris, France. \nAlso on the first floor of the Capitol, which is home to the executive branch of government, is the governor's office. It moved from the second floor in 1955. \nA few feet from the governor's office is an exhibit of miniature figures displaying the inaugural gowns of Kentucky's first ladies. \nThe second floor is home to the judicial branch. On its east end is the Supreme Court room with its Honduran mahogany paneling and Dutch metal-leafed ceiling lacquered to resemble bronze. \nIn the center of the second floor on the north side of the Capitol is the most elegant room in the Capitol, the state Reception Room. It was intended as a place for special events and as the reception area for the governor's office, which originally was next door. \nInspired by grand salons in European palaces, the room has Louis XVI-style Circassian walnut furniture and a center table covered in Italian marble. \nDenny's tour then take the west steps (or an elevator) to the Senate chamber on the third floor, the site of the legislative branch. \nThere are desks for 38 senators, who also have individual offices in the Capitol Annex behind the Capitol. At the other end of the building is the 100-member House of Representatives. \nBoth chambers have spectator galleries, but the rooms are undergoing renovation. The work is expected to be completed in November. \nThroughout the Capitol are busts or plaques in honor of notable Kentuckians, from Col. Harland Sanders of Kentucky Fried Chicken fame to former Gov. A.B. \"Happy\" Chandler. \nIf time permits, visitors are urged to take a walking tour of the Capitol grounds to see such sights as the giant Kentucky Floral Clock that is 34 feet across and the Rose Garden with about 500 rosebushes representing about 22 varieties of roses. \nOn the east end of the Capitol grounds is the 1914 Executive Mansion, home of Kentucky's governors while they are in office. It is open for free tours on most Tuesday and Thursday mornings between 9 and 11. \nTour guide Denny's goal: To have every Kentuckian and tourist soak in the beautiful and historic richness of the Capitol and its campus.
