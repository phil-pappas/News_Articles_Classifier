It is a system of ensuring proper flow of fuel into the ICE. These are used in the automobiles engines of both gasoline and diesel engines of passenger cars and commercial vehicles.\nAutomotive GDI systems atomize fuel and spray fuel vapours into the combustion chamber. These systems are primarily used in the two-stroke and four-stroke engines. The key components of an automotive GDI systems are fuel injectors, fuel pump, fuel pressure regulators, and sensors. These systems offer high-performance output combined with improved fuel efficiency and reduced exhaust emissions compare to carburetor engines. An increased oil consumption combined with shortage of oil reserves and rise in carbon emission is forcing European governments to encourage the usage of fuel-efficient automobiles and automotive components and parts such as GDI systems.\nTechnavio forecasts the automotive GDI system market in Europe to grow at a CAGR of 13.94% during 2014-2019.\nCovered in this Report\nThe automotive GDI system market in Europe can be segmented into two divisions on the basis of end-users: OEMs and aftermarket.\nTechnavio's report, Automotive GDI System Market in Europe 2015-2019, has been prepared based on an in-depth market analysis with inputs from industry experts.
