The Food Chain exists to ensure people living with HIV in London can access the nutrition they need by delivering meals and groceries, offering cookery and nutrition classes and providing communal eating opportunities. The dinner will be one of The Food Chain’s biggest fundraisers, attended by 100 donors, volunteers, corporate supporters and former service users. \nRIBA Venues has created a bespoke menu for this event, utilising modern cooking methods such as the sous-vide process to ensure that the food retains the maximum amount of nutrition and flavour. In addition the menu offers a balanced diet with the all-important omega 3, low sugar and fat content. Charlie Belbin, Fundraising Coordinator at The Food Chain, comments: “Healthy eating is important for all of us, but for people living with HIV, it is absolutely vital. Good nutrition helps to rebuild a weakened immune system, ensures that medications are properly absorbed and side effects are reduced. Our fundraising dinner is our biggest of the year and we aim to raise as much money as possible to support people living with HIV in London. “The Florence Hall at RIBA Venues is smart, spacious and its hire is reasonably priced. The menu is exquisite too – our guests are in for a real treat!” Stephanie Ellrott, Head of Venues at RIBA Venues, adds: “I’m delighted to be able to host what is clearly an extremely important event. Fundraisers such as this are vital for providing charities with much-needed donations, so I’m pleased that we can provide a venue for The Food Chain’s dinner.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:23:59.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
