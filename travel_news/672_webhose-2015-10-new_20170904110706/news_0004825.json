Expert Videos \nIf you're planning a trip to California this November - or if you're a California resident who wants to visit another part of the Golden State - I'm opening my travel writer's notebook to show you what's inside. \nHere's a roundup of all kinds of things to do, things we like and fun events happening in California this November.

Used by Permission. • November's Big Holiday: Thanksgiving \nOf course there's the traditional family meal, but after you're finished stuffing yourself, you have 3 days to play. \nForget those crazy Black Friday sales, shop online on Cyber Monday and spend the rest of the time having fun. Just a few of things you can do over Thanksgiving weekend include running events, the beginning of Christmas holiday celebrations and a couple of fun parades. More » Adapted from Cat/Flickr/CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 • Things I'm Enthusiastic About Right Now \nThis year, I hope to enjoy one of my all-time favorite California Christmas parades, the Newport Beach Harbor Parade . And I was happy to discover that they now offer bleacher seating. Or maybe I'll just get a spot on one of the lighted boats and be part of the action. \nBetween Christmas and New Year's, I'm longing for the desert: Palm Springs , Anza-Borrego , Joshua Tree . Maybe a quick stop in Pasadena on the way home to see Rose Parade preparations. \nI'm also gearing up to be online at the state parks reservation website at 8:00 a.m. sharp on November 1 because I want to stay at Crystal Cove Cottages next May. I know it's ridiculous, but that's how it works. Here's how you can make your reservations too . General Sherman Tree, Sequoia National Park. ©2009 Betsy Malloy Photography. Used by Permission. • The Best Things We Can Think of to Do in November \nIf you're a cook who loves great olive oil, November is the only time you can get newly-pressed \"olio nuovo\" in California. Find out where to get it . \nThanksgiving weekend is a nice time to visit Sequoia National Park . When I lived in LA, we did it every year, enjoying the park when it wasn't crowded, buying a holiday tree at a lot near Visalia to take home. Sequoia is nearly equidistant from LA or San Francisco, making it a good choice no matter where you live. \nOne of our favorite San Francisco tour companies had a new addition recently. Vantigo offers city tours, beer tours and oyster experiences in classic VW vans. To their already lovely Lillie Belle (a cream and red beauty) they have added Harvey, a handsome, classic blue devil named after Harvey Milk. \nDungeness Crab season starts in November. You'll find lots of restaurants starting to feature it on their menus. This is the Last Sign You Want to See On Your Vacation.
