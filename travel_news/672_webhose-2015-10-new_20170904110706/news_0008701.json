Driehaus Museum\nFeaturing more than 35 costumes from the British television series, Downton Abbey®.\nHigh-resolution images are available at www.driehausmuseum.org/press/images.\nCHICAGO , Oct. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Celebrate the sixth and final season of the beloved period drama Downton Abbey , at Chicago's Own American Palace, The Richard H. Driehaus Museum.\nTickets are now on sale for the special exhibition, Dressing Downton™: Changing Fashion for Changing Times , on view from February 9 through May 8, 2016 at the Driehaus Museum. The exhibition will feature more than 35 costumes from the popular British television series Downton Abbey. The award-winning costumes are produced by renowned London costume house, Cosprop Ltd. Many use original fabrics and embellishments from the early 20 th century, while others are re-created from old photographs, paintings, patterns, and magazine pictures. The exhibition will offer visitors a new perspective on the show's most memorable characters, both upstairs and down, while chronicling the great changes taking place in Britain during the tumultuous early 20 th century.\nThe costumes are presented in an immersive context, surrounded by the lavish interiors of the Driehaus Museum, which were once the drawing rooms, living rooms, libraries, and bedrooms of the affluent Nickerson and Fisher families of Chicago . The stories of the Fishers in particular, an urban family of new industry wealth who lived in the house from 1901 to 1914, create a fascinating contrast to the aristocratic lifestyle of the Crawley family in the British countryside.\n\"It's fascinating to see the evolution of fashion over the course of four seasons of Downton Abbey ,\" says Driehaus Museum Guest Curator Ruta Saliklis. \"Throughout the exhibition, visitors learn about the historical and cultural influences evident in these visually stunning costumes. These remarkable costumes imbue the Museum's galleries with a powerful sense of that life, reminding us of what it was like for the Nickerson and Fisher families to socialize and entertain in grand Downton Abbey style right here in Chicago .\"\nDownton Abbey introduces us to the aristocratic Crawley family and the servants who inhabit the fictional country estate of Downton Abbey in 1912, just after the sinking of Titanic. We then follow them through events that uprooted British society on the eve of World War I and ushered in the Roaring Twenties, the Jazz Age, and a new way of life. Lord and Lady Grantham ; their daughters Mary, Edith, and Sybil; and the retinue of servants in their employ represent the full spectrum of life during this period as they struggle to adapt to a rapidly transforming world.\n\"This is a special opportunity for visitors to view the costumes of Downton Abbey in a magnificent period home such as the Nickerson Mansion,\" says Driehaus Museum Executive Director Lise Dubé-Scherr . \"The exhibition was wildly popular at the Biltmore in Ashville, North Carolina and this past summer at The Paine Art Center and Gardens in Oshkosh, Wisconsin . We are anticipating it will be equally as popular here in Chicago . I am also delighted to welcome WTTW and WFMT as the exhibition's Presenting Sponsor. We greatly appreciate their support and enthusiasm.\"\n\"We are thrilled to partner with the Driehaus Museum on this landmark exhibition – one that is connected to the highest-rated program in public television history,\" says Dan Schmidt , President and CEO of WTTW and WFMT. \"We can't imagine a more perfect setting for these costumes that are so beloved by the WTTW, WFMT, and PBS audiences everywhere.\"\nDue to the anticipated popularity of the exhibition, Driehaus Museum visitors will be required to purchase advance tickets online or by phone.
