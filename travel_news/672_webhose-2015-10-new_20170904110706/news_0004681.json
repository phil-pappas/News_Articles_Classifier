Here are excerpts of the interview. What are your feelings on President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Britain? Sun Yu of the Bank of China London branch It’s encouraging and we believe it will cement bilateral relations in terms of the economy, culture and friendship and herald a golden era between the two nations. From an economic viewpoint, we anticipate a surge in bilateral trade and investment after the visit. As China’s most globalised bank with a worldwide network and the most diversified financial services platform, the Bank of China has a strong competitive edge in facilitating these business opportunities. We would also be pleased if the visit led to more yuan-denominated products being offered to investors in London to make it the world’s leading offshore RMB trading centre. As RMB internationalisation moves forward, how will it change China’s economic relations with Britain? As China’s RMB internationalisation progresses, Britain and China will enjoy better and closer financial co-operation and bilateral economic ties. The countries both agreed to hold the first meeting of the China-UK Bilateral Investment Taskforce in the latter part of this year to optimise the investment environment. During its 86 years of continuous operation in Britain, the Bank of China has been playing an active role in promoting economic and trade relations. On Sept 23, we organised the first China-UK Cross-Border E-Commerce Co-operation Roundtable in Shanghai, during which Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary, signed an agreement that is aimed at supporting British exporters and helping to promote their online sales in China. The British government is keen to develop London’s offshore RMB centre. What business changes will the Bank of China need to make? When cross-border RMB pilot programmes were launched as early as July 2009, the Bank of China London branch took the lead, offering comprehensive RMB products and services. After more than six years of continuous work, the bank’s RMB business has achieved sustained and rapid development, maintaining the leading position. Over the years, London has grown to be an offshore RMB trading centre, with its RMB forex trading volume close to Hong Kong. It’s time for the bank to upgrade its existing trading capabilities to enhance its competitiveness in the London market. The bank is building up a global service platform for customers comprised of a trading centre, syndication centre and commodity centre. This month, to fully utilise London’s position as a rising offshore RMB trading centre, the bank plans to launch an EMEA trading centre for the Bank of China in London. This will be the group’s second largest offshore trading centre after Hong Kong, will allow 24-hour integrated operation of its financial markets business and will strengthen the position of London as a global offshore RMB trading centre. What are the main challenges to internationalising the RMB? One of the greatest challenges is the relatively low acceptance of RMB by the real economy outside the Asia- Pacific region. Although Chinese banks have developed an overseas corporate customer base with keen interest in the RMB, the overall RMB awareness and usage by individuals and enterprises among offshore real economies is still limited. The other great challenge will be furthering reforms of the domestic financial system while maintaining its safety and stability, such as the liberalisation of interest rates and exchange rates and the opening up of capital account's . RMB internationalisation takes time and has to be carefully planned. It requires significant investment in financial market infrastructure and development.
