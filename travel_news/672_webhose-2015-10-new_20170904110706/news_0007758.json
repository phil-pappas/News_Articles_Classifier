And it's created a disturbing trend of photographers, and the media, ignoring the warnings and taking photos and shooting video on train tracks,\" explained Operation Lifesaver's national director, Mike Regimbal .\n\"Whether it's trying to get a shot for a news story, shooting B-roll, taking clients out to the tracks for wedding photos, snapping photos for Instagram, or taking stock photo images-when you venture onto the tracks illegally it's incredibly dangerous for everyone involved.\n\"This fall, we have committed to reaching out to the photographer and media communities in hopes of changing this life threatening behaviour,\" said Regimbal. \"We hope by reaching these audiences we will see fewer instances of railway related photographer fatalities and a decline in the publication of dangerous railway images .\"\nNew rail safety resources for photographers and media\nTo help photographers and media do their jobs safely, Operation Lifesaver has developed a set of \"Photographer Tips\" to guide professional photographers in safely incorporating railway imagery in their work. They have also launched a \"safe\" railway image gallery with photos that are free to download and are credited, courtesy of Operation Lifesaver.\nAdditional resources for photographers can be found on Operation Lifesaver's website .\nJoin the rail safety conversation online and off\nPhotographers attending this year's Profusion Expo , in Toronto , Nov. 11-12, 2015 , can expect to see Operation Lifesaver staff and volunteers in attendance, sharing the rail safety message.\nAnd online, photographers and media can join in on the rail safety conversation by following the #SeeTracksThink and #railsafety hashtags and finding Operation Lifesaver on:\nFacebook.com/oplifesaver Twitter.com/oplifesaver Instagram.com/oplifesaver About Operation Lifesaver\nEstablished in Canada in 1981, Operation Lifesaver is a national public-rail safety program sponsored by Transport Canada and the Railway Association of Canada.
