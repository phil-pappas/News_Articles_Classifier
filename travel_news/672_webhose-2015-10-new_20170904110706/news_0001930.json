This is the first year that Hyundai has teamed up with the off-road gurus at RPG, injecting off-road lifeblood into Hyundai's popular CUV. The car will be revealed at Hyundai's SEMA press conference on November 3 at 11:30 a.m. PT , in Las Vegas .\nThe bumper-to-bumper overhaul started with the most important piece of any serious off-roader: the suspension. The Tucson now sits six inches over stock height, riding on massive, 32-in. MTZ P3 tires from Mickey Thompson , and a fully-custom, adjustable shocks and struts system from King Shocks. The vehicle's wheel wells were reconstructed to create space for the new setup, now able to fit the massive suspension and tire combination.\nUpgraded turbo piping, a high-flow Magnaflow exhaust and a new K&N intake and intercooler from Mishimoto help the engine breathe more freely, providing a performance boost to the Hyundai's 1.6-liter \"Gamma\" four-cylinder power plant. Power is delivered to all four wheels through a 6-speed DCT transmission.\n\"The focus behind this build was to create an off-roader that nobody expected,\" said Nic Ashby , owner and general partner, Rockstar Performance Garage. \"The Tucson was a great starting platform with its rigid frame and plenty of room in the engine bay for modifications. With the complete suspension overhaul and blacked-out appearance, this Tucson is guaranteed to be a head turner in line with the Rockstar lifestyle.\"\nRounding out the exterior visuals, the RPG Tucson has been finished in a black and yellow livery, smoked rear tail lights, a custom LED light bar setup from Bulldog LED Lighting, and custom off road bumpers to help the vehicle shrug off impacts.\nThe RPG Tucson also comes equipped with Hyundai's next-generation Blue Link system. Blue Link's Destination Search Powered by Googleâ„¢ will help the vehicle get to all its events with ease as it tours the country next year, and all the gear inside will be kept safe using remote lock from the Blue Link mobile app for Apple Watch and Android Wear. The RPG team can also rest easy, knowing that if their Tucson is ever stolen, Blue Link can assist authorities to quickly find and immobilize it.\nFollow #HyundaiSEMA to keep up to speed on all of this year's SEMA activity.\nPOWERTRAIN MODIFICATIONS\nMishimoto 2.5-in.
