The campaign will center on \"& TOKYO ,\" a new logo and slogan that embodies the concept of the city. The logo will gain exposure through various opportunities, both in Japan and overseas, thereby spreading the Tokyo brand far and wide.\n\"& TOKYO \" is based on the brand identity \"A city that promises all kinds of fun by constantly generating new styles while bringing tradition and innovation together,\" formulated this March as part of Tokyo's branding strategy. It seeks to disseminate the underlying message to the world that Tokyo is a city where a variety of people, things and events create new kinds of enjoyment by forming new values and connections.\nVarious words or corporate logos can be inserted before the \"&.\" Therefore, the logo can be used widely by Tokyo residents, private businesses, and foreign tourists as a tool for conveying Tokyo's value and appeal to the world.\nFrom here on, we hope that more Tokyo residents and private businesses will participate in the Tokyo Brand Promotion Campaign, coming together as one to promote the city's diverse values, as well as its fun-filled days packed with new discoveries and experiences that can only be had here. Through this, we will ultimately aim to create even more fans of Tokyo all over the world.\n-- Examples of PR tools (stills/videos) featuring the \"& TOKYO \" logo and slogan can be seen on the Tokyo Brand website and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government website, and via the URL below.
