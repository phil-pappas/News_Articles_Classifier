Customers will be able to easily pre-book door-to-door transport to and from Napa Valley. One-way, per-person rates from downtown San Francisco start as low as $54 (based on six passengers riding in an SUV). The service will be available via the company’s award-winning mobile app, at http://www.groundlink.com/napa , or by calling the company’s 24/7 reservations line at 1 -855-231-9684. Napa Private Driver is competitively priced according to the vehicle category selected and the destination. Transport from downtown San Francisco in a three-person luxury sedan to/from Napa Valley is priced at $249 (each way), at $275 (each way) to/from San Francisco and Oakland airports and $325 to/from San Jose. The six-person, SUV-class vehicle is priced at $325 (each way) to/from downtown San Francisco, $349 (each way) to/from San Francisco and Oakland airports and $399 from San Jose. Tips, tolls, taxes and gratuity are additional, but are shown in the final price prior to booking. Unlike with on-demand services or other black car services, Napa Private Driver customers will never be subject to surge prices or increased pricing during peak periods.\nGroundLink’s user-friendly app and website allow customers to easily select their pick-up and drop-off locations for Napa Private Driver using nearby airports, venues, addresses or their ride history. Customers can also track their car and driver from the time the driver is dispatched until they are dropped off at their destination, using the GroundLink mobile app or a link provided in SMS car location alerts sent to them.\nThe launch of Napa Private Driver follows this successful launch of Hamptons Private Driver in New York this past summer and is in direct response to California residents and visitors looking for an alternative to driving themselves to wine country. The service provides an alternative to self-driving following wine tastings and consumption of alcoholic beverages. With Napa Private Driver, riders can leave the driving to a fully-insured and professional driver, and not be concerned about drinking and driving. This service is also a scheduled alternative to on-demand, shared-economy providers.\n“With our new Napa Private Driver service, travelers don’t have to be concerned about drinking and driving and don’t have to chance their precious weekend getaway or vacation time with an on-demand service in hopes that a car might be available. They can schedule their ride exactly when they wish to leave, “ said Liz Carisone, CEO of GroundLink. “They also won’t have to deal with the unpleasant sticker shock of surge pricing during high demand periods.”\nIn addition to the luxury sedan and SUV-class vehicles, Napa Private Driver also offers the option of travel in a VIP Sedan, Mercedes, or Van. Pricing of these class vehicles will vary according to availability.\nAbout GroundLink\nGroundLink is a tech-enabled provider of executive black car service in major cities throughout the world.
