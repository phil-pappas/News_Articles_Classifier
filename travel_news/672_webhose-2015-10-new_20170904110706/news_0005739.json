The tail of the aircraft features Anna and Elsa celebrating sisterhood and the magic of snow. Moving along the aircraft from back to front, the magic travels to warmer climes where Olaf can be found enjoying a summer day on the beach. The theme carries through to the interior of the aircraft with images on the overhead bins, bulkheads, lavatory mirrors and headrests. \n\"This aircraft takes the relationship between WestJet and Disney to a completely new level of cool,\" said Bob Cummings, WestJet Executive Vice-President, Commercial. \"Two years ago, we launched the #MagicPlane, our first Disney-themed aircraft, and no matter where it flies throughout our network, it is the most-anticipated and most-photographed aircraft in WestJet history. Today, we are proud to team up with our great friends at Disney to create a sequel like no other.\" \n\"To see our vision come to life is so exciting, as we collaborated on this project for over a year. Only a very small group of us (WestJetters and Disney Artists and Cast Members) knew and we had to keep our secret under wrapsâ€¦ or should I say, on ice,\" said Marlie Morrison, Managing Director, The Walt Disney Company (Canada) Ltd., Parks & Resorts. \"It's a truly unique and unforgettable design that Disney Fans and WestJet guests alike will enjoy for years to come.\" \nFun facts about the #DisneyFrozenThemedPlane: \nThe aircraft was painted in Fort Worth, Texas. The paint team included team members from Canada, the United States and Germany. They watched Frozen to get them into the spirit before work began. The job took 21 days of 12-hour rotations involving a constant crew of six painters working 24/7. The crew used 643.5 litres of paint consisting of 23 colours -- five for the umbrella alone. Sparkles were added to the paint in sections to add shimmer and shine as the aircraft moves. An airbrush artist was brought in to work on details around the sun, water and castle. The inside of the aircraft has decals and headrest covers that mimic the cold-to-warm (back-to-front) theme on the outside of the aircraft. There are 54 separate overhead bin doors on the aircraft and each has a unique Frozen decal. Several dozen bagels were consumed during the painting of this aircraft (there weren't any doughnut stores nearby). The crew drank more than 100 litres of sweet tea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:57:12.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
