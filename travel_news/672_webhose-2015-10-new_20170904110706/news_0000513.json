I’ve been playing tennis for most of my life and can hold my own with accomplished players. I’m able to make a respectable showing at racquetball and squash and play a decent game of Ping-Pong. And badminton? Please. So when, asymmetrical wooden racket in hand, I took to the Royal Tennis Court at Hampton Court Palace in Surrey, England , for a “real tennis” lesson, I was unprepared for the humbling that was forthcoming.\nWhen I first heard about real tennis a few years ago — people playing tennis with old-fashioned rackets, balls and rules — I imagined it was either a questionable fad like “beach tennis” or involved linen-clad trendsetters ironically re-enacting scenes from Victorian costume dramas. And I had no idea that indoor pro tournaments, like the World Tour Finals held each November in London, had an ancient precedent.\nAs time went by, however, the roots of the game began to intrigue me. I took keen notice, for example, when the author Hilary Mantel, in “Bring Up the Bodies,” her acclaimed novel about the court of King Henry VIII, wrote of Anne Boleyn’s unfortunate ties to real tennis. When she was arrested she had been “doing what she always used to do: She had been to the tennis courts, where she placed bets on the outcome of the matches.”\nPhoto Real tennis is still played at Hampton Court, outside London. Credit Andy Haslam Anne Boleyn would have been familiar with tennis at Hampton Court, the residence of Cardinal Wolsey, an enthusiastic tennis player, and appropriated by Henry VIII after the cardinal fell from favor. The indoor Royal Tennis Court was completed in 1529 and rebuilt on the same site in 1625 for King Charles I.\nLike all “real” tennis courts, the Royal Tennis Court features sloping roofs, called penthouses, which abut three of the four interior walls and are in play. A picture of Henry VIII fills a window on the receiving side and, among many other arcane rules, a point can be won by hitting his ample, kingly frame with the handmade, felt-covered ball, which is fashioned at the court’s pro shop. A comically oversize net looks as if it’s been allowed to sag in the middle from neglect.\nThough it’s part of the huge palace, which is about an hour outside of London and is one of England’s most popular tourist destinations with its manicured lawns and impressive hedge maze, the Royal Tennis Court is an active real tennis club where members — who until recently have tended to be older, male and upper-class types — play the game as it was played in Tudor times, without a trace of irony. Occasionally, palace tour groups stop to watch from the galleries that line two sides of the court.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story If relatively obscure compared with the modern game (technically called lawn tennis), real tennis, referred to as court tennis in the United States, still thrives, kept alive by its adherents, who tend to be fanatics who relish being part of a small subculture surrounding this quirky game.\nThere are around two dozen real tennis clubs in Britain; 10 in the United States, including tony clubs in Newport, R.I., and Tuxedo Park, N.Y.; and a smattering of courts in Australia, Ireland and France, where it is called jeu de paume, or the “game of the palm,” because the ball was struck with the hand before the advent of rackets. In England, the real tennis community is tightly knit, and enthusiasts are keen to bring new players into the sport because they want to make it more popular. I found it easy to book a few introductory lessons and took advantage of a recent trip to England to try the game.\nOn the court, I quickly learned that my lawn tennis skills would not translate. The game — and its rules — whizzed past me like sentences in a foreign tongue. I couldn’t get the heavy racket, which resembles a bulky wooden squash racket, in place fast enough to make good contact with the low-bouncing ball, and never seemed to be in the right position to return a ball that caromed off a wall or trickled off the penthouses.\n“As a coach, one of the biggest issues is battling with preconceived attitudes,” said Nick Wood, the Royal Tennis Court’s head pro, a lean man with graying hair, glasses and a reserved demeanor. “Squash and tennis players feel they need to take a big swipe at the ball and miss it. In real tennis there is a feeling of having less time. Rackets are smaller, you have to watch the ball more acutely,” he said. The swings used in golf and cricket (sports I don’t play) have more in common with a real tennis swing, Mr. Wood said.\nPhoto Real tennis balls, unlike their modern counterparts, are solid and hand made. Credit Andy Haslam The rules were as vexing as the physical side of the game. Real tennis is scored the same way as lawn tennis is, but with all sorts of technicalities added on. For example, if the ball bounces twice, the point is not necessarily over and a sort of do-over can be played later. The game has the general feel of having been invented by someone who changed the rules on the fly to avoid losing.\nThough real tennis courts can have slightly varying dimensions, they all have the three penthouses, and points can be won in various ways by guiding the ball into windows under them. The game is often compared to chess for its variety of stratagem and tendency to produce new scenarios, even for the seasoned player.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The pros at Hampton Court, as elsewhere, are able to introduce the technique and rules in a brisk 50-minute tutorial, leaving the remainder of an hourlong lesson to actually play. Since I booked my lesson with a longstanding nemesis from lawn tennis, I considered the stakes quite high. We were both hapless, but had better luck when we tried to simply block the ball with the head of the racket, rather than swinging at it. We finished in a face-saving draw.\nAfter another lesson on a new court at Middlesex University in London, I was invited by an English acquaintance for a lesson and game at the venerable Queen’s Club, also in London. Named for Queen Victoria, the club’s 12 grass courts and idyllic grounds are home to the Aegon Championships, a lawn tennis tournament seen as an important tuneup for Wimbledon. Queen’s has a stately clubhouse, a strict all-white dress code and two courts for Racquets , a terrifying progenitor of squash in which rock-hard balls fly off stone walls at 120 miles per hour. It’s also got two real tennis courts.\nBuilt in 1886, the real tennis courts at Queen’s are slightly shorter and narrower than the one at Hampton Court Palace, said Andrew Lyons, a pro at the club. The ball bounces a bit higher at Queen’s because of construction idiosyncrasies, and the backspin that causes a ball to die in the corners — a good thing for the server — is less effective coming off the limestone walls there.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story “Much more than any other racket game, there is a massive home court advantage for every real tennis player,” said Mr. Lyons, who is a “marker” — a combination of umpire and linesman — at pro events and who won the British Open real tennis championships in 2013 in the over-40 division.\nMr. Lyons advised me that a real tennis forehand uses the same motion as skipping a stone and that a backhand is similar to throwing a Frisbee, mental devices that allowed me to gain some measure of control over my shots. Serves must bounce off the penthouse, and Mr. Lyons showed me how to guide the ball there with an underhand slice serve, which is a valid, even encouraged technique in real tennis. As for the rules, he told me to relax, saying that Queen’s often hosts real tennis tutorials for corporate groups and that “the groups that come in after they’ve had their Champagne toast at lunch always do better with the rules.”\nPhoto Real tennis uses irregularly shaped rackets. Credit Andy Haslam After the lesson, Mr. Lyons left my partner and me alone for an actual game, a first for both of us. We felt abandoned; it was like sailing into a lake with just enough nautical knowledge to keep from capsizing. (Even accomplished real tennis players often employ a marker to keep track of the scoring.) At times we didn’t know who won the point so we just awarded it to the person who felt like the winner. I lost the match badly, but by the end we were having rallies and making decent contact. Actual fun had replaced a feeling of anxiety about learning a game whose many rules we couldn’t fully remember.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Like the rules, the origins of the game are somewhat opaque. “The best research indicates that the game originated in the streets,” said Roman Krznaric, a cultural historian and competitive real tennis player. “ ‘Penthouse’ is an English word for the awnings which were over shop fronts in medieval streets,” Mr. Krznaric said. Real tennis courts, he said, are most likely a reproduction of the streets on which an early, outdoor version of the game was invented.\nThe game exploded in the 1500s partly because it lent itself to gambling, and Henry VIII, an inveterate gambler who reigned between 1509 and 1547, was an important patron of the game, Mr. Krznaric said. The king loved betting on tennis and built courts around London, including one at Whitehall Palace, which was converted into a building that now houses the prime minister’s cabinet.\nFurthermore, “the king was a sportsman, he was into hawking, hunting, archery and jousting,” said Mr. Krznaric, who is the author of “The First Beautiful Game,” a history of real tennis. “He was six feet tall and he could probably move like a cat. I imagine he was a good player.”\nReal tennis was in decline by the 18th century as other games replaced it in popularity and many courts, which occupied valuable urban real estate, were converted into theaters and music halls. Once in decline, “the game got kind of fossilized and was preserved by the aristocracy,” Mr. Krznaric said. “In the late Victorian period and early Edwardian periods you had a new building of courts, but they were at country houses. They were elite. The game was no longer the democratic game that it was in Tudor times.” By the end of the 1800s, as it became fashionable for wealthy Americans to ape the behavior of the English upper crust, a handful of courts were built in the United States.\nAround the same time, modern tennis took off after a British cavalry officer developed a simple lawn tennis, or “sphairistike ” set, employing an ancient Greek word. The name didn’t stick, but the game did. Its rules were easy. The game could be played on any lawn, and it was cheap. Real tennis took another hit in the middle of the last century when many English country estates went into decline and their courts became cow sheds or tractor barns.\nWith about 5,000 active players in England, though, the game still has its adherents, and continues to draw new players, many of whom are intrigued by the game’s links to the past, Mr. Krznaric said. “If you want to get a feel for Tudor England, come to a real tennis court. It’s better than walking through a palace or watching ‘Wolf Hall.’ On the real tennis court you get a sense of what society was like, with people watching from the galleries or gambling. The rules are basically unchanged. It felt like it still feels today,” he said.\nPhoto Mixed doubles at the Queen’s Club in London. Credit Andy Haslam In the days that followed my first forays onto the real tennis court, I found myself thinking of the game, not least because, back on the lawn tennis court, I was unable to adjust to the lighter racket and was hitting forehands over the back fence, something I haven’t done since I was 11.\nBut my interest had been piqued. I daydreamed of following the ball as it bounced along the penthouses, envisioning the endless geometry of the game, waiting to pounce on the ball when it did fall into the court and hearing the twang made by contact with my racket’s tiny sweet spot. I might have even imagined polite applause and the ruffling sound of money changing hands in the galleries. I won’t quit lawn tennis, but as soon as I stepped off the real tennis court, I was thinking where and when I could play this peculiar game again.\nIF YOU PLAY The website of the International Real Tennis Professionals Association is a wealth of information about the game. irtpa.com\nIn England The Royal Tennis Court is open to visitors for private lessons, but it’s well-subscribed, so book early; private lessons start at £47 (about $70 at $1.50 to the pound); Hampton Court Palace, Surrey, 44-20-8977-3015 ; royaltenniscourt.com.\nThe Queen’s Club holds a few open days a year for nonmembers to try out the facilities; contact the club for details.
