And now Andrea has realised his vision – weekly Sunday lunch, Il Pranzo della Domenica, guaranteed to become a favourite way to spend a Sunday afternoon for Hotel guests and local residents alike.\nAndrea Accordi and Percorso Chef Valerio Andrisani remember from their early childhood that Sunday lunch was when the whole family comes together while visiting their mother or grandmother is a sacred time for every Italian. For these meals, the menu is planned in advance, the recipes are selected with extra care, and the table must be abundant with delicious treats – because Sunday sets the mood for the week to come.\nThe menu for Il Pranzo della Domenica at Percorso promises a hearty meal that stimulates gastronomic curiosity. For starters, a rich selection of antipasti is being served on the table, then it’s time for pasta or risotto . Following that, guests select the main course – meat, fish or vegetarian . And the sweet finale of Il Pranzo – a selection of a half dozen mini-desserts from Executive Pastry Chef Paolo Sannini to be enjoyed with tea or coffee.\nThe Italian mood of Il Pranzo is being created not just by Andrea and Valerio who love to speak with guests and are always present. Sunday lunch in Percorso is accompanied by a specially created soundtrack by a DJ whose task was to compile a beautiful musical program consisting of merry and touching Italian tunes. Meanwhile, one of the rooms of Percorso is turned into the Kids Club, where the energetic and funny animation team is in charge of the children, so they do not get bored during the slow Sunday lunch. Little guests below six years of age dine for free.\nThe price of Sunday lunches in Percorso depends on the beverage selection. A sumptuous meal with one non-alcoholic cocktail, unlimited soft drinks and tea and coffee costs RUB 4,500 per person. The RUB 5,500 set offers additionally unlimited wine, vodka and beer from special selection. For RUB 6,500 guests can also have unlimited Bellini cocktails and prosecco.\nThe atmosphere of Il Pranzo della Domenica is further enhanced by the unique interiors by world famous designer Yasukhiro Koichi: five distinct dining rooms of Percorso iin five stylish halls created in rare materials, including Italian stone and tiles with unique patterns.\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:54:24.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
