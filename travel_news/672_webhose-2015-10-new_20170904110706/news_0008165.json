In recent years Newson has teamed up with Qantas to revamp the entire seating plan on the A380, going as far as to incorporate a massage function into the business and first class seats. Earlier this year, he unveiled new Qantas business and first class lounges at LAX after revamping the Qantas lounges in Sydney. I quizzed him on taking his practice up in the sky for Qantas.[caption id=\"attachment_1278\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] Qantas First Lounge[/caption] Airplane seats are typically uncomfortable. What did you do to try to solve that problem? Firstly — I felt not only privileged but uniquely qualified to do this project as I spend a huge amount of my life flying — every week of my life in fact - and it was an opportunity for me to address all the things I hate about aircraft seating. Saying that, an aircraft seat is an enormously complex piece of engineering — which is not surprising considering what it has to do. Flying constantly to and fro 24 hours a day for 10 years. Aircraft seats are among the most brutally treated and rigorously tested products you can design. With the Skybed we ironed out all the irritations of air travel: where to stow your mineral water, your glasses, your shoes and the reading lamp that never seems to be in quite the right place. Also I wanted there to be privacy — I wanted it to feel like a cosy cocoon. In Economy, small details that make all the difference to the long-haul flight experience — like the addition of a foot net leg rest and additional knee and shin room. I love how you put a massage setting on the business class seats. What was your inspiration for the business class seats? My inspiration was to create a haven of personal privacy and total comfort. I didn’t want the passenger to have to search for anything beyond this seat. What did you take into account when designing the lounge at LAX? In all the lounges (the first being in Sydney) — I was trying to reintroduce some of the style and romance of the early years of aviation…the glamour and the feeling of luxury. We tend to forget that not so long ago air travel was considered to be a glamorous and enjoyable experience - I really wanted to evoke that feeling again. We used materials of quality throughout, such as marble, leather and solid European oak to enhance this feeling. I have created different niches through the entire space to provide a sense of intimacy in contrast to the exceptionally long bar in each lounge made of solid marble which is a particular focal point as well as having proven to be a magnet for socialising. What kind of feel did you want it to have? An inviting and relaxing feel of calm in luxurious comfort How does designing for an airline differ from your other clients? The design part is actually easy — it is working within the limitations of the aircraft industry that’s challenging. Health and Safety, testing, and fire regulations, there are a million and one parameters that you have to work within – and only about five per cent room for creativity. But that’s the challenge as a designer and in this case it was one I embraced with passion.", "external_links": ["http://www.marc-newson.com/Default.aspx", "http://www.qantas.com.au/"], "published": "2015-10-01T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:20:57.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
