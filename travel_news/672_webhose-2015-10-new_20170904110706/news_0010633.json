Its release launch took place at the Global Sustainable Aviation Summit in Geneva, Switzerland, alongside an open letter from industry chief executives which reaffirms the industry’s commitment to climate action.\nDr. Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, President of the ICAO Council, explained that “the ICAO State Action Plan initiative, inclusive of its capacity building and financing coordination aspects, is one of our most successful undertakings in addressing State aviation emissions reduction. The partnerships this programme fosters and the results it achieves help to underscore ICAO’s focus on assistance and capacity-building, in line with our No Country Left Behind campaign goals for aviation development and the UN’s 2030 Agenda.”\nMichael Gill, Executive Director of the Air Transport Action Group, the cross-industry association responsible for the publication, said: “Aviation plays a vital role in the world economy, providing connectivity for people and business. Our industry has also taken a lead in climate action, putting in place a comprehensive framework and goals to reduce emissions from air transport. Aviation Climate Solutions presents a series of case studies showing how different parts of the sector all over the world, including governments, are working together today to reduce our climate impact.”\nIn 2010, world governments agreed to improve international civil aviation fuel efficiency by two per cent per year, while stabilizing the sector’s CO2 emissions at 2020 levels through a variety of measures, including technological and operational improvements, alternative fuels and a global market-based measure(MBM). ICAO’s State Action Plan initiative supports this work by identifying voluntary climate actions and fostering the partnerships and capacities needed to realize them.\nJust two weeks ago, the ICAO Global Aviation Partnerships on Emissions Reductions (E-GAP) Seminar highlighted more than a thousand of partnerships among governments, industry and other stakeholders for reducing aviation emissions.\nThe partnerships highlighted in the ICAO E-GAP seminar and the climate actions showcased in the ATAG publication form part of the message from aviation to the upcoming UNFCCC COP21 conference in Paris, where climate change agreement is expected to be reached.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:13:15.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
