This creates a strong demand for service, especially since western standards such as the ATP regulations (set of standards to be met by refrigerated vehicles carrying perishable foodstuffs) will be adopted starting in 2016.\nFor the local development of its subsidiary, Fraikin worked in partnership with Dayim Holdings, which brings its contacts and support in Saudi Arabia , including government administrations, banks, customers and suppliers.\nFraikin confirms its inte rnational expansion\nThe new subsidiary's opening is a reflection of the group's expansion plans.\nFraikin's goals are expressed in two strategic lines of action:\n- to strengthen its leadership position through premium positioning and continuous improvement of customer satisfaction\n- to increase its global reach by establishing a presence in new countries.\nAbout Fraikin:\nBacked by 70 years of experience and revenues of 643 million euros in 2014, the Fraikin Group is the European leader in industrial, utility and commercial vehicle leasing.
