Hide Caption 1 of 17 17 photos: Istanbul – Sitting astride the divide between Europe and Asia, Istanbul is surrounded by a region in turmoil. But the city is a joyous reminder that it doesn't have to be that way. Hide Caption 2 of 17 17 photos: Bagan, Myanmar – The capital city of the first Myanmar Kingdom, this enormous Buddhist complex on the Irrawaddy River contains more than 2,500 intricate monuments dating to the 10th century. It's a slip in time to an Asia that no longer exists in many other places. Hide Caption 3 of 17 17 photos: Sailing the Caribbean – Hiring a private sailing yacht in the warm waters of the Caribbean is easier than it sounds, made worthwhile with quiet days on the open sea and stops at islands that can still feel newly discovered. Hide Caption 4 of 17 17 photos: Holi festival (India) – The riot of color that is India's Holi festival is enjoyed around the world. But it retains a special significance in Mathura, the spot revered as Krishna's birthplace. Hide Caption 5 of 17 17 photos: Great Barrier Reef (Australia) – With more than 3,000 individual reefs interspersed with hundreds of tropical islands, the Great Barrier Reef is unmatched by any other reef system. It's size is a reminder of the vast scale of the Earth's oceans and the fragility of its ecosystems. Hide Caption 6 of 17 17 photos: Paris – Not everyone gets to declare love in Paris. Once a year though, they can at least declare their love of chocolate when confectioners and cocoa experts celebrate tastes and creations at the city's Salon du Chocolat. Hide Caption 7 of 17 17 photos: Kyoto, Japan – On the flip side of Japan's tech-loaded supercharged urban culture are its peaceful palaces of calm -- the Buddhist temples and shrines. In Kyoto, the old imperial capital of pagodas, visitors can embrace mindfulness and meditation. Or just take a pleasant walk. Hide Caption 8 of 17 17 photos: Chicago – Perhaps because it always plays third billing to the coastal stars of New York City and Los Angeles, Chicago has a keenly developed sense of humor. It's the training ground for America's funniest people. Hide Caption 9 of 17 17 photos: Drakensberg, South Africa – It's almost impossible to Instagram a bad picture of South Africa's stunning mountain landscape. It's been inspiring artists since long before the advent of social media, offering a window into how our ancestors experienced life and nature. Hide Caption 10 of 17 17 photos: Buenos Aires – As much a part of Buenos Aires as tango, fine wine and steaks, books are one of the city's most appealing assets. The Argentine capital has more bookstores per capita than any other city in the world. Hide Caption 11 of 17 17 photos: Forbidden City (Beijing) – A center of power for nearly five centuries, China has invested heavily in re-establishing the Forbidden City as a symbol of the country's historic might and prestige. Every stop inside is a lesson in ambition. Hide Caption 12 of 17 17 photos: U.S. Highway 1 up the Pacific Coast – America's love affair with the automobile is consummated in triumphant style along its West Coast Highway 1. Sharp twists, dramatic cliffs and powerful bridges make for an exhilarating drive into an epic landscape made for putting things into perspective. Hide Caption 13 of 17 17 photos: New Orleans Jazz Fest – The music and food New Orleans is known for known for are better than ever. No more so than at its annual Jazz Festival -- a true celebration of life and overcoming its obstacles. Hide Caption 14 of 17 17 photos: Wimbledon (London) – Yes, it's a tennis tournament, but the two weeks a year when the swanky London suburb of Wimbledon draw in the crowds are only partly about sport. The event is also a celebration of old school Britishness that offers ticket holders their own glimpse of a world that's more Downton Abbey than ESPN. Hide Caption 15 of 17 17 photos: Gorilla trekking (Rwanda) – It's a tough slog, but the trek deep into the rainforest of Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park brings you face to face with one of the few mountain gorillas still alive anywhere. Meeting them can changes the very idea of what it means to be human. Hide Caption 16 of 17 17 photos: Bali, Indonesia – Mass market tourism has made its mark on Bali, but the Indonesian island wears it well. It's still a place of escape -- beloved by writers and artists -- with beautiful scenery, excellent food, nightlife and quiet retreats.
