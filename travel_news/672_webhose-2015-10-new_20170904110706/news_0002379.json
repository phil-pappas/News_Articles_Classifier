Answer: They’ve all written songs about coffee We can add Marianne Faithful and Otis Redding to the list. Frank Sinatra, Cream and The White Stripes too. Given the ubiquity of cafés and coffee houses over the last few hundred years, a cup of the good stuff was bound to pop up in popular culture sooner or later (and yes, as much as we revere good old Bach for his Brandenburg Concertos, what are they if not 18th century popular music?). Coffee has appeared in just about every cultural medium one can think of – even architecture. In Bedford, Pennsylvania, you will find The Coffee Pot, a fine example of the programmatic (or novelty) style. Built in 1927 by Bert Koontz to advertise his garage to drivers passing on the Lincoln Highway, it was converted into a bar in 1937, with a hotel at the rear, and became a popular stop for passengers on the Greyhound bus. Even architecture has been influenced by the humble cup of coffee Photo: Corbis In art, it’s hard not to think of Paul Cézanne’s Woman with a Coffee Pot or Lovis Corinth’s portrait of his friend Benno Becker, in which Becker sits reading the paper, idly stirring his espresso, or Fernand Léger’s cubist Three Women , a take on the artistic staple of the reclining nude, this time with added caffeine. From the 18th century on, coffee cups and pots begin to crop frequently in painting, which is hardly surprising given the rapid growth of the world’s coffee habit. In literature, too. Given that nothing really goes together as well as a good cup of coffee and a good book, we should naturally expect to find several good cups of coffee in a lot of good books. Writers good and bad are nothing if not chasers of truth. With coffee consumption so widespread, anyone worth anything will have to write about it, from making the coffee house a setting (like Leo Tolstoy) to building a scene around the making and serving of coffee (Tolstoy again). And that’s not to mention measuring out one’s life in coffee spoons. But for the true fetishisation of all things coffee, we really have to turn our attention to celluloid, and its heady brew of image, character and cool. Just picture for a moment the opening sequence of Breakfast at Tiffany’s as Audrey Hepburn climbs from her cab, with dark glasses on and jewels around her neck – and plainly the worse for wear – to look at those Tiffany’s diamonds in the window. She nibbles her croissant, sips her take-out coffee. She is the epitome of chic. For the true fetishisation of all things coffee, we really have to turn our attention to celluloid Robert De Niro faced down Al Pacino over coffee in Heat . Paul Rudd expressed the fury of the millions who just want a cup of coffee in Role Models . Hitman Joe Pesci took his coffee to go in Goodfellas . Chazz Palminteri’s Agent Kujan dropped his cup, he was so shocked by the ending of The Usual Suspects . And from the movies (and stage play) we learn, as Alec Baldwin bellows at Jack Lemmon in Glengarry Glen Ross , that “coffee’s for closers”. But while Twin Peaks ’ Dale Cooper can proclaim his love for “a damn fine cup of coffee”, a sentiment as near-as-damn-it identical to Harrison Ford’s John Book saying “honey, that’s great coffee” in Witness and as far removed from Samuel L Jackson’s Jules pronouncing Jimmy’s coffee to be “some serious gourmet shit” in Pulp Fiction . None of these beats will make you salivate for coffee as much as just one shot in Kieslowski’s masterful Three Colours: Blue . Julie sits in a café listening to the flautist busk across the street, having sent her would-be lover away, and holds her lump of sugar at the surface of her cup’s coffee. The bitter blackness climbs the ladder of white sugar to her fingers. Has ever an espresso been more evocative, more beautiful, or more desirous?
