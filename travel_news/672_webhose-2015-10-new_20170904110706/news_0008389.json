The launch of a separate Web site to promote a new ship, complete with tours and video, presents it as a major event and could build anticipation and create early sales. \n“With enhanced design specifications and enriched content, the Silver Muse will continue to build on the sophistication, innovative style and ground-breaking concepts for which Silversea ships are renowned,” said Brad Ball, director of corporate communications at Silversea Cruises , Fort Lauderdale, FL. \nSimply divine At the top of the Web site is a video about the background of the Silver Muse ship. In it, chairman Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio describes the ship as an evolution of previous models rather than a complete innovation, saying that Silversea Cruises listened to the wants of past passengers and consumers and designed it with them in mind. \nSilversea cuts steel on new Silver Muse \nThe video also highlights the “tailor-made experience,” the increase in the number of large suites, some of which can even be combined to accommodate large parties, the number of dining options and food choices and the new outdoor venues. \nAlso of note is the brand’s relative lack of concern for the size of the ship and accommodating an abundance of passengers. The Silver Muse will instead highlight the spaciousness and passenger/crew ratio. While it has not been made public, previous ships have accommodated around 270 passengers and 220 crews, showcasing the brand’s dedication to excellent service. \nOwner’s suite \n“Silversea has shown remarkable dynamism and ability to achieve important results in this market,” said Giuseppe Bono, CEO of Fincantieri, the shipbuilder building the Silver Muse, in a statement. “This project offers us the opportunity to develop creative solutions and set new standards for shipbuilding in the ultra-luxury segment.” \nBelow the video is a 360-degree view of the ship in both daytime and night, with quick navigation to the stern, port, starboard and bow. Further down, a scrollable view ship of the ship shows users where the suites, restaurants and public areas are. \nClicking on any of the seven suite types presents the consumer with the dimensions, photos and description of the suite type. For restaurants, six of the eight are available, while the other two and the public areas will be added soon. \nThe French dining option by Relais & Châteaux aboard Silver Muse \nBookings are not yet available, but interested parties can sign up for updates to be alerted when reservations can be made. By unveiling the ship ahead of reservations and nudging guests into signing up, they will also be made aware of the various other features and benefits of the ship, sustaining anticipation through the booking period and eventually to the inaugural voyage. \nFor many consumers, the journey is more important than the destination when taking a cruise. Having eight different restaurants spanning multiple cuisines gives patrons an opportunity to have different meals each time, while a favorable crew/passenger ratio and suites of varying sizes ensure the comfort of guests, all of which could make Silversea Cruises a popular choice among those looking to get the most of out of their journey. \nSilversea Cruises’ Web site for the Silver Muse can be viewed here . \nSomething in the water Other cruise lines have made the cruise stand out in other ways. \nFor example, March Regent Seven Seas Cruises has been giving consumers hands-on cuisine experience since March, when the new instruction center on its Seven Seas Explorer vessel opened. \nThe Culinary Arts Kitchen accommodates 18 students, who will each have their own cooking station within a space modeled after French cooking schools. Guests that participate will remember the lessons learned long after they disembark, elongating the memory of their cruise ( see story ). \nOthers with a longer history have found unique ways to celebrate heritage onboard. \nIn January, global cruise line Cunard feted its 175th anniversary with a series of onboard events pointing to its history. \nFrom retracing the original transatlantic crossing to remembering the sinking of the Lusitania, Cunard is involving consumers in both the highs and lows of its heritage through special packages and online content. Commemorating a milestone can help prompt booking from loyal travelers, who want to experience the special time with their favorite brand ( see story ). “Silver Muse will once again significantly raise the bar in the ultra-luxury cruise market with a wealth of enhancements to the onboard experience, while satisfying the uncompromising requirements for comfort, service, and quality of the world’s most discerning travelers,” Silversea Cruises’ Mr. Ball said. “This ship contributes to our ambitious growth plans that will ensure our continued leadership in ultra-luxury cruising.” \nFinal Take Forrest Cardamenis, editorial assistant on Luxury Daily, New York", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:45:32.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
