Find out the answers to these and other questions concerning some of the fantastic shows available with Sky Box Sets ... ENTOURAGE Watch seasons 1 to 8 with Sky Box Sets Did you know Ari Gold is based on a real Hollywood agent? Photo: Entourage® ©2015 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc. The fictional agent in the show – Ari Gold played by Jeremy Piven – is one of many links to real-life that occur in almost every episode of Entourage , the comedy drama which follows the lives of a young Hollywood superstar and his hanger-on band of friends. Piven’s character is based on genuine Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel, whose real-life actual clients such as Vin Diesel and Larry David are also credited as clients of Gold on the fictional show. Plus the list of guest appearances over the eight series is mammoth and ranges from former Python John Cleese to golfer Phil Mickelson. BOARDWALK EMPIRE Watch all 5 seasons with Sky Box Sets Did you know James Gandolfini was eyed to star? Photo: Boardwalk Empire SM under licence from Home Box Office, Inc. The first ever episode of Boardwalk Empire was directed by Hollywood’s most celebrated helmer Martin Scorsese, who remained an executive producer throughout the series. As creator Terence Winter was carrying out his casting, he consulted Scorsese with whom he had worked on The Sopranos . At one time, they both considered the late James Gandolfini for the role of Nucky Thompson, the man at the centre of the crime drama set in the Prohibition era. Gandolfini physically resembled the real-life character who was the inspiration for Nucky, but Scorsese then brought Steve Buscemi (another Sopranos connection) into the conversation and he eventually took the role. THE ENFIELD HAUNTING Catch the first season now with Sky Box Sets Did you know 30 people witnessed the poltergeist? Eleanor Worthington-Cox is the young actress who handled the extremely challenging role of 11-year-old Jane Hodgson in this chilling drama. The Enfield Haunting follows the true story of an ordinary British family who claimed their council house was also the home of a poltergeist. The Enfield poltergeist phenomenon continued for 18 months, and was witnessed by police and researchers. More than 30 people witnessed the strange incidents. Although the whole Hodgson family is affected by the strange phenomena, it is Worthington-Cox’s character Jane who had the most ghoulish glitches as she was believed to be possessed and actually seen to levitate from her bed. The Liverpool-born actress was outstanding thanks mostly to her veteran performance on the West End stage – she was one of the four original girls cast in the title role in Matilda the Musical and even won a prestigious Olivier award. PENNY DREADFUL Catch the first season now with Sky Box Sets Did you know James Bond was the catalyst for the series? Photo: Penny Dreadful © Showtime Networks Inc. All rights reserved. When talent gets together to create a series like the British-American horror drama Penny Dreadful , there is usually a good reason. In 2009, American writer John Logan had his dramatic play Red produced at Donmar Warehouse, the venue where Sam Mendes has a strong connection because of his earlier role there as artistic director. Then three years later, Mendes was director of the blockbuster James Bond movie Skyfall with Logan as his writer, which then led to the two men working together again in Penny Dreadful with Logan writing every episode and Mendes acting as executive producer. The series has another 007 connection – it stars former Bond Timothy Dalton. NASHVILLE Watch seasons 1 and 2 with Sky Box Sets Did you know T Bone Burnett created the music? Photo: Nashville ©MMXIII, Lions Gate Television Inc. and ABC Studios. All Rights Reserved. Music in Nashville is, of course, of paramount importance to the success of this show, which chronicles the trials and tribulations of a group of fictitious country singers working in the titular town. Therefore, it was no surprise when the show’s creator Callie Khouri appointed her husband and musical maestro T Bone Burnett as executive music producer and composer for the first season. Nashville ’s initial musical reputation was in good hands because Burnett is not only a gifted and respected musician himself, but he had already overseen music for hit films including Walk the Line about the life and times of Johnny Cash, one of country’s biggest ever stars. STALKER Watch every episode with Sky Box Sets Did you know the series creator was stalked himself? Photo: Stalker © 2015 Warner Bros Entertainment Inc. Kevin Williamson is the creator of Stalker and what a career this man has had. It began when the North Carolina native came up with the idea of the teen drama Dawson’s Creek , then followed that up with the Vampire Diaries and finally The Following , all big hit TV series around the world. But Williamson isn’t just noted for his work on television, he’s also a prolific hit screenwriter in the movies. He developed and wrote the slasher film Scream as well as two of its sequels. Williamson had the idea for Stalker after being stalked himself, which is how he discovered the Threat Assessment Unit, a specialist department within the Los Angeles Police Department which deals with stalkers. The TAU also acts as the liason between the LAPD and other government agencies such as the FBI and the Secret Service. As Williamson himself admits, it only took 15 years to bring his idea to the small screen. CRITICAL Catch the first season now with Sky Box Sets Did you know the show’s creator studied medicine? One of the most distinctive aspects of this startling British medical drama is the near-incomprehensibly detailed hospital language produced by show creator and writer Jed Mercurio. Critics and fans both liken it to the hit American police show The Wire in terms of the amount of jargon and terminology spoken by the doctors and nurses saving lives in the fictional trauma centre. But the specialised script should not be a shock because Mercurio was originally a medical undergraduate in Birmingham. He undertook his first writing job only after answering an advert by the BBC in the British Medical Journal, thereby changing his career plans and writing a drama called Cardiac Arrest . CHICAGO FIRE Watch seasons 1 to 2 with Sky Box Sets Did you know the real mayor of Chicago appeared in the pilot? Photo: Chicago Fire © 2014 NBC Studios LLC. All Rights Reserved The extent of the reality connections within Chicago Fire is often overlooked even by keen-eyed fans. Not only is the name of the show the same as the city’s soccer team (a pure coincidence, by the way), but the building used in the show as the firehouse is actually a real working Chicago Fire Department firehouse. The four seasons of the programme follow the lives of both firefighters and paramedics. Another parallel with real-life in the pilot episode happened when the city’s mayor Rahm Emanuel made an appearance. Emanuel said: \"It's easier being mayor than playing mayor. I told them I'd do it under one condition: the TV show is making an investment to the Firefighters' Widows and Orphans Fund.” SONS OF ANARCHY Watch all 7 seasons with Sky Box Sets Did you know William Shakespeare inspired the show? Photo: Sons of Anarchy © 2014 Fox and its related entities. All rights reserved. It might sound crazy, but there are a whole bunch of references to Hamlet in the seven seasons of this crime drama about an outlaw motorcycle gang in California. In fact, the show is sometimes referred to as Hamlet on Harleys , especially as the father of lead character Jax is usurped for power by his gang brother who then goes on to marry Jax’s mother – sound familiar? Then Jax mistakenly murders an innocent man, just as Hamlet does. The show’s creator Kurt Sutter has admitted the connections with Shakespeare and even titled several episodes by using direct Quote: s from Hamlet, most notably season seven’s “What a Piece of Work is Man” and “Suits of Woe”. THE BLACKLIST Watch seasons 1 and 2 with Sky Box Sets Did you know the main character is based on a real-life mob boss? Photo: The Blacklist © 2014 Sony Pictures Television Inc. All Rights Reserved Raymond “Red” Reddington – the star of The Blacklist and played superbly by James Spader – is number one when it comes to having the most mysterious backstory than any character on television. Creator Jon Bokenkamp wanted “Red” to be enigmatic, so he filled his past with more mysteries than an Agatha Christie novel. It will take a major flashback moment to uncover why he disappeared as a young man for four years after being on a fast-track naval career towards becoming an admiral. While his re-emergence as a kingpin of the criminal underworld is also still unexplained. Bokenkamp said his initial inspiration for Reddington was Whitey Bulger, boss of the Boston Irish mob. • Watch back-to-back episodes of Sky’s biggest TV shows like these and more with Sky Box Sets.
