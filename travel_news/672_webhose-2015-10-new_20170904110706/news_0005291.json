The theme will be “Open skies: Growth through competition and collaboration”. The event has been organised under the patronage of His Excellency, Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of the Republic of the Congo.\nAFRAA regroups 45 African airline members and around a hundred industrial partners, including aircraft and engine manufacturers, consultants, and high technology service providers, as well as representatives of governments, airports and international organisations.\nThe Association was created in 1964. Its mission is to encourage and support African companies as they develop their air transport services. It also aims to facilitate cooperation between African companies in order to develop interconnectivity and establish a maximum of intra-African relationships. The AFRAA General Assembly is a unique business event in Africa and it takes place every year in November. It is organised by an African airline and is attended by an average of 400 participants. This includes airline directors, chief executive officers and decision-makers on a global scale.\nDuring this event, participants explore the challenges of the aeronautical industry and debate on which measures to implement in order to improve air transport growth across the continent.\nFatima Beyina-Moussa, ECAir managing director and AFRAA President, will also participate in a round table with other directors of African airlines: Mbuvi Ngunze, Kenya Airways managing director, Tewolde Gebremariam, Ethiopian Airlines president and managing director, Sherif Fathi, EgyptAir president and managing director, Abderahmane Berthe, Air Burkina managing director, Sanjeev Gahdia, Astral Aviation managing director, and Khellil Faical, Tassili Airlines managing director. Assembly programme:\nThe AFRAA General Assembly will put the spotlight on the Republic of the Congo’s aims and challenges with regard to air transport, thanks to dialogue between aeronautical experts. Eight airports have either been restored or built in 10 years in the Republic of the Congo. Last August, national airline, ECAir, reached a big milestone: one million passengers have been transported since the airline was created four years ago.\nThe Summit’s Brazzaville location will attract the attention of the world industry towards the Congolese capital’s extraordinary opportunities, particularly with regard to the Maya-Maya Airport. Furthermore, commercial and tourism ties will be strengthened throughout the continent and with new and traditional markets outside of Africa (Dubai, China, Europe).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:57:05.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
