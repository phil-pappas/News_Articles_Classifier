Presented by VISIT DENVER, The Convention & Visitors Bureau, Denver Arts Week will highlight more than 300 events all week long – often free or deeply discounted – at more than 100 cultural venues around the city; and this year is anticipated to be the largest celebration of Denver’s vibrant cultural scene yet.\n \nMany participating arts organizations are adding new elements in expectation of a record number of Denver Arts Week events and attendees. One of Denver’s cultural epicenters, the Art District on Santa Fe, will close down the street to vehicle traffic for Know Your Arts First Friday – the first time this has been done during the event. RiNowill offer a VIP Safari on the same night.\n \n \nThe Denver Art Museum will offer a sneak peek at a new, blockbuster exhibition featuring Andrew and Jamie Wyeth during the Free Night at the Museums – the preview requires a small admission fee, but entrance to the rest of the museum will still be free that evening.\n \nIn addition, Denver is on stage all week long with new theater, music and dance performances and the Denver Film Festival; and many organizations are offering more deals and discounts than ever before, including a $52.80 price tag on original works of art, among others.\n \n“Denver has long been home to a thriving arts scene, and Denver Arts Week provides the perfect opportunity for residents and visitors alike to get out, explore and feed their creative side,” says Jayne Buck, vice president of tourism for VISIT DENVER. “Every year, Denver’s arts and cultural organizations and galleries roll out the red carpet to showcase the best of Denver’s visual and performing arts. The Denver Film Festival brings national and international cinema to The Mile High City, and cultural icons like the Denver Museum of Nature & Science and the Denver Botanic Gardens have special events during the week as well.”\n \nFollowing are some highlights of the ninth annual Denver Arts Week; a complete calendar of events for the full week, deals, discounts and details can be found on the Denver Arts Week website.\n \nSource:- Visit Denver", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:37:11.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
