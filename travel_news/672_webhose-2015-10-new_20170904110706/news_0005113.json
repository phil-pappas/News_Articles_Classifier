Picture: iStock\nJohanna Leggatt Escape CROSSING the street in Mumbai requires a mixture of raw chutzpah and telepathy.\nYou will need a dose of courage just to step into the path of oncoming traffic – walking signals are operational, but routinely ignored – and a certain intuition will also come in handy in divining whether the car will, in fact, stop short of your beseeching, outstretched hand.\n“If you did this in Australia, the driver would get out of the car and punch you,” my friend remarks, as a handful of cars slow mid-street to allow us to cross.\nIndeed. But then Mumbai is a city full of endless surprises and contradictions. Unbelievably patient with tourists crossing the road, Mumbaikers will nevertheless all but throw you against the wall to get off a crowded train during rush hour.\nMumbai is home to one of Asia’s best five-star hotels – The Taj Mahal Palace – but it is also one of the few cities where you will routinely receive receipts written on carbon copy paper.\nEven its name isn’t set in stone. Many locals write Mumbai but say Bombay; airline tickets will reference the new name, while the accompanying baggage tags are pointing to its colonial moniker.\nThe city’s Bollywood film industry is the height of sophistication and glamour, but a large swathe of residential areas are slums.\nMumbai is doubtless a special place. And to savour all of the city’s diversity, to be jostled (literally and figuratively) by its immense energy and life, you will want to spend at least three days here.\nGateway of India used to welcome dignitaries from abroad. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\nDAY ONE\nThe streets are clogged with honking cars, street vendors and a potpourri of overwhelming scents. Street dogs sniff at detritus on the sidewalk in search of food, while hawkers attempt to sell you objects that you will never have any use for (giant balloons, anyone?)\nThere may be a temptation to jump in one of the city’s many metered cabs (make sure you insist on the meter being used), but it is worth walking at least some of Mumbai on foot if only to appreciate the sensory overload.\nMumbai, on India’s west coast, is a huge city of some 20 million people, but a large concentration of the most interesting tourist attractions are in south Mumbai, in particular the Nariman Point, Churchgate, Fort and Apollo Bandar areas.\nThe south is also the best place to take in the turn-of-the-century colonial apartment blocks – some faded and decrepit, others immaculate and clearly expensive.\nMuch of south Mumbai seems caught up in a war between civilisation and its wildness.\nGiant, breathtaking old banyan trees wrap themselves around gates and buildings so that they appear to be choking the man-made interlopers, while hawks and kites hover above the rooflines of hotels and government buildings.\nFans of architecture should not miss The Bombay High Court and Victoria Station – since renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus – which offer excellent examples of Edwardian and Victorian-era styles.\nAt the end of the day, pop your head into the terminus and watch Mumbaikers rushing to catch their evening service.\nWhile people are no longer allowed to climb on to the tops of trains, it doesn’t stop them from riding half outside a cramped carriage, hanging on to the door for dear life. Local tourist guides estimate that thousands of people die falling from carriages each year.\nChhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is also a short cab ride away from the iconic Regal Cinema, which screens Bollywood movies in an attractive art deco theatre. Although most films do not offer subtitles, it isn’t hard to tease out what is going on in these three-hour tales of heartache, family intrigue and woe. Other gorgeous nearby art deco cinemas include Eros and Liberty.\nFlower sellers in south Mumbai. Picture: Johanna Leggatt Source: Supplied\nDAY TWO\nMumbai is often viewed as the modern face of India and while it lacks the ancient artefacts of Delhi, south Mumbai has some great museums and historical attractions.\nThe Asiatic Society, at Fort, is not only the best example of neoclassical architecture in India, but it also serves a thoroughly modern purpose.\nIt is here that dozens of members head to each day to read newspapers and books in the crumbling building with only a few fans to keep them cool. It was founded on November 26, 1804, and to this day holds more than 100,000 books, many of which are rare and valuable. By far, the most famous museum in Mumbai is Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly the Prince of Wales Museum), which owns 60,000 art objects dating back to 2000BC.\nThe museum’s collection of decorative art objects in jade, wood, metal and textiles is stunning, especially the jewellery box dating back to 1903, carved on thin sheets of ivory.\nAfter hours of walking and sightseeing it is a real treat to jump in a cab and head to Trident Hotel’s basement spa, Silhouette, at Nariman Point, for a traditional Indian head massage or champi.\nTrident is a five-star tourist hotel but they employ some experienced champ wallahs to pummel you. Be warned: champi is not for the faint-hearted and the pressure is much more intense than what Australians would expect from a Balinese or relaxation massage.\nAfterwards, head to nearby Marine Drive, also referred to as The Queen’s Necklace, to stroll along the water at dusk; if it is a clear evening the sunset will be nothing short of spectacular.\nFew visitors miss seeing the caves of Elephanta Island. Picture: Johanna Leggatt Source: Supplied\nDAY THREE\nFew tourists come to Mumbai without visiting Elephanta Island and with good reason. Off the coast of Mumbai, Elephanta is a collection of seven caves carved out of basalt rock and dedicated to the god Shiva.\nYou need to buy your ticket at the Gateway of India (scores of hawkers sell tickets for the ride), and it is worth spending some time along the waterfront before you board the boat. The gateway itself, built during the era of the British Raj, is an impressive basalt arch and was used to welcome governors and other dignitaries from abroad.\nYou may also like to take a quick peek inside the beautiful Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, which overlooks the gateway, and features pictures in the lobby of the celebrities and presidents who have called the Taj home.\nThe boat ride to Elephanta takes a little more than an hour – whisking you past the giant freighters moving cargo in the Sea of Oman – and then it’s a short tram ride and a walk up a slope to the majestic caves.\nThe 7m-high masterpiece Sadashiva, greets visitors to the entrance of the first cave, and its three faces represent the three aspects of Shiva – the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer.\nElephanta is overrun by street dogs, but they are timid and will leave you alone. The resident monkeys, on the other hand, are extremely assertive and will think nothing of grabbing food from your hands, so be careful when you are eating. And don’t be afraid to prod them away with a stick.\nA day at Elephanta is best capped off with some sunset drinks, and the ideal place to watch the sun go down over the Arabian Sea is from one of the five-star hotel’s rooftop bars.\nMany tourists rave about the InterContinental’s The Dome bar, but it is worth jumping in a cab and travelling further north to the ridiculously hip Aer Bar at Four Seasons Hotel, which has a great cocktail list, impressive service and amazing views from the 34th floor.\nCocktails are half price between 5.30pm and 8pm, and on a Friday and Saturday night the bar is filled with the best-looking people, including the occasional Bollywood star, you are ever likely to see.\nIn fact, whenever Mumbaikers gather together it is unlikely to be a dull experience.\nIt was Samuel Johnson who famously wrote that when you are “tired of London, you are tired of life”, but, in the 21st century, the same holds true for Mumbai.\nThe metropolis is life writ large, in all its teeming, scary, joyful and downright shocking incarnations.\nYou just have to hang on.\nBritannia and Company, a Parsi and Iranian restaurant in Mumbai, India. Picture: Alamy Source: Alamy\nCULTURAL MELTING POT\nTHEY are the beloved Mumbai eateries that are renowned as much for their colourful history as for their authentic and cheap food.\nThe Parsi cafes of Mumbai are a testament to the city’s multicultural fabric, and are a delicious time warp.\nMany were established in the 1800s by Parsi settlers – Zoroastrians from Iran — and like many charming vestiges of another era they are a dying breed.\nMost have been passed on to the second generation of owners, some of whom have had little desire to continue the hard slog of running a busy Mumbai cafe and have sold their businesses — often located in sought after areas — to developers.\nChief among those still flying the flag for Parsi culture is the Britannia & Co cafe, founded in 1923 and run by the legendary Parsi proprietor, 93-year-old Boman Kohinoor, who inherited the business from his father.\nOn the day we visit, the cafe is in the thick of its lunchtime service and a steady stream of patrons of all cultures — Westerners, Hindis, Muslims — crowd in for the famed food.\nAs if to make the point that everyone is welcome, Boman has framed the flags of India, the Union Jack and Iran and hung them together on one of the restaurant’s walls. A life size cut-out of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge watch over the diners from the mezzanine level. Bow-tied waiters swoop and hurry us to our table, and Boman himself appears almost instantly at our sides, pointing to the menus before telling us what to order.\n“No, you want the special berry pulav,” he chides us when we suggest a more familiar dish. The berry pulav, Boman explains, was invented by his late wife, who brought the recipe from Iran. And the dish tastes amazing.\nWe eat our food as Boman regales us with his stories of visiting celebrities, interspersed with some skittish social commentary.\n“No one is having babies in your country,” he says, looking at me — the only woman in our travelling party — directly.\n“You have all this space,” he adds, gesturing widely. “And only 20 million people in it.”\nThere are a handful of other excellent Parsi cafes in south Mumbai, including Jimmy Boy, which is great for an authentic breakfast. But if you only have time to visit one, then make it Britannia & Co.\nPeople buying vegetables at a sidewalk store in a suburb of Mumbai.

Central Mumbai is 32km from the international airport; take a prepaid taxi from the airport to your hotel.\nSTAYING THERE\nThe Taj Mahal Palace Hotel is still the place to stay in Mumbai, and the facilities and pool are a first-class respite from Mumbai’s chaos. Upgrades are common in Monsoon season too. See tajhotels.com\nEATING THERE\nTasty, reliable Indian is everywhere in south Mumbai, but if you are hankering for some amazing international cuisine head to Indigo ( foodindigo.com ) and enjoy a meal on the terrace. The Italian restaurant, Vetro, at the Oberoi ( oberoihotels.com ) is also rated highly.\nDOING THERE\nJoin the throng of swooning couples watching the sun set against the backdrop of the Arabian Sea and take a stroll along Marine Drive at dusk. Take a food tour of Mumbai’s hottest eateries and restaurants with local guides from Finely Chopped walking food tours.\nfinelychopped.net/p/finely-chopped-waks.html\nTake a boat ride from the Gateway of India to Elephanta Island, which features a series of 7th-century cave temples dedicated to the Hindu god, Shiva.
