Story highlights A man, 25, died Sunday on a flight from Portugal to Ireland, the Garda says in a statement Another passenger was injured after the man became \"agitated,\" police say Police have also arrested a woman after allegedly finding amphetamine in her luggage on the same flight (CNN) Police are investigating the sudden death of a man on a flight from Portugal to Ireland and have arrested a woman allegedly found with amphetamine on the same flight. It is unclear if the two incidents are connected. Ireland's national police, An Garda Siochana, said a 25-year-old man had died after becoming \"agitated\" Sunday on the Lisbon to Dublin flight. Another passenger received a hand injury during the incident, the Garda said in a statement. Irish and UK media reported that the man had allegedly bitten the other passenger on the hand during the Aer Lingus flight.

He was attended to by a doctor and nurse who were on the flight but was pronounced dead at the airport at 6:40 p.m,\" the Garda statement said. A post-mortem on the man is being carried out at Cork University Hospital. Police said they also discovered \"what they believe to be 1.8 kilograms (4 pounds) of amphetamine in the luggage of a woman in her 40s who was on the same flight.\" The woman -- believed to be a Portuguese national -- was arrested and was being held under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, police said.
