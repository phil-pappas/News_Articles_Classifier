And the wifi password was ‘spooky’.\nHead into town and dry ice ­whistles down the street. You can hear blood-curdling screams from surrounding buildings.\nGo into the CVS pharmacy and you might find a solemn-faced Puritan eyeing up the detergents.\nOutside, people accuse each other of being witches – and through it all, the town’s folk go about their business, nipping into Pamplemousse the deli for Vampire Blood wine.

Women hanging out together are probably convening for a trip to the Peabody, the oldest museum in the US.\nIt’s a spectre-free zone, mixing maritime ephemera with Chinese ceramics, and a brilliant introduction to the other side of Salem.\nHat trick: Kids have fun\nAfter the witch hysteria, the Massachusetts town became one of New England’s biggest shipping points, bringing coffee and spices to the New World.\nThese days, the witty David Bowie (yes, really) is passionate about spices, with his shop near the port ( salemspice.com ).\nAccording to my guide Karen Scalia, who gives fascinating foodie tours, Salem was home to the US’s first millionaire, who made his money from peppercorns.\nAnd so to nightfall.
