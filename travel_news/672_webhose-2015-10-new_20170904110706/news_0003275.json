The initiative will focus on short and medium-haul markets such as Japan, South Korea, South-east Asia, Pacific and the Middle East. \n\nThe Peninsula Hong Kong.

Therefore, we’d try to link up every single market initiative the HKTB has to promote the city. \n\n“We provide for aspects which (hotels) cannot manage by themselves. Obviously, every hotel has different strategies; for instance, Royal Garden Hotel wants more (South) Korean traffic so GTA would share data and intelligence like what (South) Korean tourists want.” \n\nParticipating hotels include all Regal Hotels International's properties, Pentahotel Hong Kong, East Hong Kong, Cosmo Hotel Hong Kong, Cosmopolitan Hotel Hong Kong, Dorsett Mongkok, Royal Plaza, Sheraton Hong Kong Hotel & Towers, Royal Garden, W Hong Kong, Grand Hyatt Hong Kong, The Peninsula, as well as The Park Lane Hong Kong, a Pullman Hotel. \n\nLauding the new programme, Ken Ng, general manager-customer service, Lotus Tours, commented: \"The number of hotels is just right and encompasses four to five-star properties (which are a good) fit for FITs. GTA’s massive network in Asia and Australia makes it a good distribution network.” \n\nIn November, the programme will extend to Dubai with 24 hotels lined up there. Lee added: “We target three destinations per year with Thailand in the pipeline.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:03:33.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
