Full-time equivalent employment (FTE) grew 3.3% year-over-year (YOY) in August, to a total FTE count of 397,007 personnel. \nAugust was the 21st consecutive month of overall rising employment at US airlines and the highest monthly total since September 2008. \nBTC ANALYSIS \nThese findings demolish U.S. major airlines’ claims that Gulf carrier success in U.S. markets is killing aviation jobs. In point of fact, Gulf carrier codeshare partners JetBlue and Alaska Airlines saw their August FTE employment year-over-year grow 10.5% and 9.6% respectively against 3.7% for U.S. major network carriers. And the success of the Gulf carriers has added tens of thousands of U.S. aerospace jobs and travel and tourism jobs in communities across the nation. \nFor example, when Emirates Airlines initiated service this fall to Orlando, some 1,400 local jobs were created. What’s more, JetBlue added high-paying jobs and drove down fares 40% for consumers in the monopolized Boston to Detroit city-pair when its partner Emirates entered the Boston market and provided the necessary passenger feed to enable JetBlue to mount the service. \nHad Norwegian Air International’s application some 18 months ago to serve the U.S. been approved, thousands of jobs and greater consumer cho ices and alternatives would have been created by now. \nThe Administration needs to take a stand for consumers and against protectionism before irreparable damage is done to the reputation of the United States as a reliable trade partner and the Open Skies system on a worldwide basis unravels.
