It is highly likely to be applied to Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter as its energy to replace the electricity. usa, 20 October 2015 -- intelligent self-balancing scooter</b> appeared in Beijing Olympic Game for the first time. At that time, the people were still obscure about them. These days, the intelligent self-balancing scooter becomes the household name to the public. To some extent, the great popularisation should be owed to the fact that the sector as a whole is on a rise and keeping a high momentum. Take Airwheel for example. Both in design of exterior look and in the technology, Airwheel has made staggering progresses over again and again. From the perspective of design, Airwheel successfully made considerable modifications to its electric self-balancing scooters . In early year, it transformed the single-wheeled scooter into the twin-wheeled intelligent scooter. Because the single-wheeled scooter still has a part of customer base, hence the single-wheeled scooter into the twin-wheeled intelligent scooter are one the market at the same time. After soon, Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter translated to the two-wheeled self-balancing scooter like S3 and S5. Shortly afterwards, Airwheel pushed out the original modeâ€”the sitting-posture riding mode, i.e. Airwheel A3. On the other hand, the evolution of Airwheel electric scooter technology is similarly worth a review. Their core technologies are aerospace attitude control theory, fuzzy software algorithm and gyroscope system. Apart from the basic technologies, the wireless connection, electronic brake system, hydraulic suspension, connection to the mobile phone and so on are complementary to the above core technologies. It is well acknowledged that the advent of new technology makes for the breakthrough each time. The following breakthrough remains contingent on the arrival of new technology.It is quite reasonable to forecast the new introductions to Airwheel intelligent self-balancing scooters . The solar-related technology comes a long way these years. It is highly likely to be applied to Airwheel electric self-balancing scooter as its energy to replace the electricity. That way, Airwheel electric scooter will emphasise the economy of electric scooter battery. Others like voice control and AI will also be introduced to Airwheel.
