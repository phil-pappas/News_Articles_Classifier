These are the words of many Germans living and working overseas. Germany has become a welcoming country of immigrants and hope for many. \nOpenness, being tolerant and peace through tourism is a model for Germany. Tourists from all over the world visit the country these days - and Germans remain one of the biggest market for outbound travel. \nIt has been 25 years for the German Democratic Republic joining the Federal Republic of Germany. This day marks recent history in a proud Germany today. \nWhat happened 25 years ago in Berlin makes every German in the world proud. \nCelebrations across the country are planned for today.Frankfurt takes center-stage for this year's public events while German Unity Day is also being marked around the world. \nThis year, Germany is marking the 25th anniversary of German reunification with a public celebration in Frankfurt. Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Joachim Gauck are among those due to attend. \nEach year since 1990, a city has been chosen as the public expression of German Unity Day celebrated on October 3. \nBundesbank President Jens Weidmann opened a presentation about monetary union and remarked: \"The exhibition also reminds us that Frankfurt was the starting point for a huge step on the path to German unity.\" The exhibition is part of \"FRANKFURTinsights - the 1,000 wonders of Frankfurt.\" The city, which is home to the European Central Bank, is staging a series of events over the weekend. \nThere have been events and parties around the world marking the Day. In Saudi Arabia the royal family expressed their goodwill via Twitter: \nIn Pakistan, German Ambassador Ina Lepel was asked about lessons for South Asia from the German experience: \"Regional cooperation and integration is not a zero sum game but one from which everyone can gain. In Europe, we started slowly, and then the good results came,\" she told the Express Tribune newspaper. Pakistan's German-educated national poet Allama Iqbal was \"the first link between our two countries, he studied in Heidelberg and got his PhD from Munich,\" the Ambassador added. \nOther celebrations are taking on a more cultural theme - as in Stretford, Manchester in the UK: \nReunification \nThe steps towards re-unification between East and West Germany began one November night in 1989 when German Democratic Republic (GDR) citizens were told they could travel to West Berlin without formal travel passes. Within days, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced his ten point plan for \"Overcoming the division of Germany and Europe.\" \nElections in the GDR in March 1990 brought an East German counterpart of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party to power and the two states began to discuss economic and currency union. The USA, Soviet Union, UK and France were consulted over foreign and security policy. By July the Deutschmark replaced the Ostmark, economic union was achieved and a second treaty - for German Reunification - was drawn up. In August 1990, the date of October 3 was agreed for Germany's official reunification, with Berlin as the capital. \nWhat is next in the world. North Korea joining the South?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:56:42.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
