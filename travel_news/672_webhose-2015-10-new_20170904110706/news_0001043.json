Indiana Transmission II and Kokomo Transmission each received the bronze designation in 2014.\n\"It is appropriate that this honor comes as Kokomo Casting marks 50 years in operation because it recognizes the commitment of our workforce to building on the plant's history and creating a global path for future success,\" said Brian Harlow , Vice President - Manufacturing, FCA North America. \"The Kokomo Casting employees have dedicated themselves to improving safety and quality while operating the world's largest die cast facility and playing an integral role in our operations around the world.\n\"WCM continues to be a vital part of this Company's growth and could not have been achieved without the support of our UAW partners,\" said Harlow. \"Our hourly employees have demonstrated that they are committed to keeping FCA US competitive with the best manufacturing facilities in the world.\"\nOne of five FCA US Indiana facilities, Kokomo Casting employs nearly 1,300 people who use nearly one million pounds of metal each day to cast aluminum parts for automotive components, transmission and transaxle cases, and engine blocks. The facility is best known for supporting the production of the eight- and nine-speed transmissions that can be found in one of the following vehicles: Jeep Â® Cherokee, Chrysler 200, Jeep Renegade, Ram ProMaster City, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Durango and Ram 1500. More than a million of each transmission has been assembled and shipped from the nearby Kokomo and Tipton, Ind. , manufacturing facilities.\nWorld Class Manufacturing is a methodology that focuses on reducing waste, increasing productivity and improving quality and safety in a systematic and organized way. WCM engages the workforce to provide and implement suggestions on how to improve their jobs and their plants, promoting a sense of ownership.\nWCM was first implemented by Fiat in 2006 and introduced to Chrysler Group as part of the alliance between the two companies in June 2009 . Not specific to the FCA family, this global methodology is practiced and evaluated in non-automotive industries by companies such as Barilla, Royale Mail , Thermal Ceramics, Elica, Ariston Thermo and Villanova Logistics.\nDuring an audit, zero to five points are awarded for each of the 10 technical pillars, which include safety, workplace organization, logistics and the environment, and for each of the 10 managerial pillars such as management commitment, clarity of objectives, allocation of people, motivation of operators and commitment of the organization. A score of 100 would indicate World Class.\nTwo WCM certified auditors from FCA -- a representative from the Central Staff of the WCM Development Center for Europe , the Middle East and Africa , and the Plant Manager of VM Motori in Italy -- performed the audits.\nIn addition to Kokomo Casting, there are eight other facilities that currently hold the WCM bronze designation: Saltillo Truck Assembly Plant (Mex.), Saltillo South Engine Plant (Mex.), Trenton Engine Complex (Mich.), Warren Stamping (Mich.), Indiana Transmission Plant II (Ind.), Kokomo Transmission Plant (Ind.), Toledo ( Ohio ) Assembly Complex, and Toluca Assembly Plant (Mex.). Windsor Assembly Plant (Ont.) and Dundee Engine Plant (Mich.) received the WCM Silver designation in March 2014 and May 2015 , respectively.\nAbout FCA US LLC\nFCA US LLC is a North American automaker with a new name and a long history.
