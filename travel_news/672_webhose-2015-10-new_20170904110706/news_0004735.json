Over a four-month period, all Travel Agencies around the world have been requested to participate in this survey to determine, based on several criteria, which Airline deserves the label of best Company of the year, as seen by the industry.\n5418 Travel agencies from 85 different countries nominated 161 different Airlines and…for the second year, Emirates is recognized as “the most recommended airline to clients”, winning first place based on the overall votes. Emirates will therefore receive our « Airline of the Year » AWARD for 2015. In addition to this nomination, three Airlines which received several hundred votes:\nAir France/KLM, Tarom and Lufthansa will each be given an APG AWARD reflecting their quality of services offered – as recognized by the travel agent community.“Travel agents opinion is rarely sought and therefore the A.W.A.R.D. gives them the opportunity to express their choice among all global airlines, based on their experience.” Says Sandrine de SAINT SAUVEUR – CEO – APG Network Winning Airlines will be presented with their AWARDs during the 7th APG World Connect Conference to be held in Marrakesh between October 28th-30th, 2015.\nSource:- Emirates", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:13:43.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
