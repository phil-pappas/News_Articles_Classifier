The company is partnering with Paperless Post for a brand-new collection of stationery —a staggering, nearly 200 sweet designs for every occasion. There are baby announcements that can be customized with photos, Christmas cards, moving announcements, thank-you cards, an extensive wedding suite (including darling save-the-date illustrations for Chicago, Atlanta, New York, and other major U.S. cities), and much more.\nWhile Rifle Paper Co. is known for its physical paper goods (as well as iPhone cases, wallpaper, and countless other pieces emblazoned with its designs), Bond is also a proponent of elegant digital correspondence. “Although I love stationery . . . sometimes it’s not practical or convenient to send a paper card,” she says. “So we wanted to be part of making the alternative beautiful as well.” And it’s also a bit of a departure for a company founded on the premise of digital correspondence: Paperless Post will be offering both paperless and physical paper versions of the designs starting today, as well as hosting its first-ever pop-up store called Bloom Room on 171 Elizabeth Street in New York, open to the public October 8–11. Below, an exclusive first look at some of the charming designs from the Paperless Post x Rifle Paper Co. wedding suite.\nCards start at $130 for 50 cards with lined envelopes, and start at 25 cents each for e-cards.", "external_links": ["https://www.paperlesspost.com/cards/group/riflepaperco", "https://riflepaperco.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:04:18.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
