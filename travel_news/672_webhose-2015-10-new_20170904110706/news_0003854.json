Sardinia, thanks to Bitas (International Tourism Exchange in Sardinia) shows up and now for three days will become the heart of the international and economic world. If it’s true that the tourism is an economic issue, Sardinia for these days is the hub of business world.\nIn the B2B (business-to-business) meetings, 73 are the buyers coming from all over the world (i.e. USA, UK, Spain, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands) that will meet the 250 Sardinian operators to study and buy tourism packages designed on the needs of travellers. And most of what will be offered are packages for tourists who love sports and adventure, from kayaking to sailing, from hiking, climbing, paragliding, to skydiving up to the diving. Sardinia and Dorgali, where the show is organized this year, is an ideal place to combine vacation and sports: the rugged and rocky mountain plunges into one of the most beautiful seas of the Mediterranean. “But the island, although only 25,000 square chilometers is yet to be discovered and is the ideal destination for adventurous travellers: very low populated and with a mild temperate that allows playing sports all the year long”, as said by the council member of Regional Government.\n“Living in Sardinian – as commented from the mayor of Dorgali – is a great advantage because as an island: in other continental countries you travel without even noticing crossing a region from another. But not here. Here we know that everything we treasure is Sardinia and the traveller has to choose to come here because we are an island, you can’t come in Sardinia by chance. But the emotions that Sardinia gives exceed the natural boundaries of the island”.\nOn the first day of the exhibition all the side-events to B2B meetings have been presented and in particular the “Mediterranean Race adventure”, has started. With five teams of athletes, including two women (two Poles, a British couple, and two Italian) They left for a non-stop 350 km race without any other guidelines except for a GPS. A real adventure that will bring the athletes to sleep wherever it happens and reach the checkpoints alternating running, cycling and kayaking. And by canoe the competitors will reach Cala Gonone.\nSardinia is beautiful and every stranger tourist who comes here brings back good memories of landscapes, colours and flavours. The goal of this exhibition (Bitas) is therefore to show the island to those people who didn’t discovered it yet, giving them – with adventure sports – more reasons to come here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:20:58.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
