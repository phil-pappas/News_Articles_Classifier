The NOVUM Hotel Group is also setting sights on expansion abroad. In addition, more and more focus is laid on franchise contracts. \n“If you are reaching your goals ahead of schedule, you should place them higher. This time we will be going out on a limb, but not by much, since our forecasts could not be any better. The frequency of our hotel takeovers is increasing steadily and our pipeline is packed.“, says David Etmenan, managing partner of the NOVUM Group. \nAt the beginning of this year, David Etmenan placed the company’s target at 60 hotels within the next 3 years, a target that will in all probability be reached in a third of that time. Currently, the NOVUM Group is operating 57 hotels. Three other deals are as good as in the bag and will be announced later this year. \n“We are currently sharpening our focus on growth through franchising. We are already in advanced talks with Accor, specifically regarding the brands Ibis and Mercure. The voices of our investors on this matter are also very positive“, reports David Etmenan. \nThe NOVUM Hotel Group is just as ready for yet another major step – the acquisition of hotels abroad. The focus here is mainly on German-speaking countries, but the Netherlands is also an appealing prospect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:37:53.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
