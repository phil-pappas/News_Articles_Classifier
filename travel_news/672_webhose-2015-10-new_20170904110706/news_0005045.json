In many ways, it defined what would happen to us as we entered the next stage of our lives , inspired by the time we spent together on the road. It was 1989, a time of change. The former Soviet Union was being dismantled, with the Berlin Wall broken up later that year. It was a year, too, of technological change, as industry marked the start of the digital age. The UK was enjoying the ‘Second Summer of Love’ with the explosion of the rave scene. In fact, I am wearing a 20th-anniversary Woodstock T-shirt in my photos of that incredible trip, which also represented a genuine change in me, shaping the person I was to become. I was lucky – my dad was a pilot for British Airways and I got these super-cheap tickets to the States as a gap-year treat. I started it wearing a shirt and tie, as all BA family members were required to do, but as soon as I got to San Francisco, the spiritual home of the Sixties revolution, I got my jeans on. My photo album is beautifully Instagrammed, in the sense that the photos really are old, and they look it. The chemicals in the prints must have altered them over time, giving them an antique feel. A young Dallas Campbell in 1989, in the heart of America ©Jake Henderson My travelling companions were Will, a friend since high school, and George, whom I had met the previous year at San Francisco airport. Will was a proper hippy, George was ‘artistic’, and we were all into ‘art rock’ music at the time. All three of us were 18 and I sported a rather feeble attempt at a quiff. Once they’d met me off the flight, off we all went to look for America – in a Simon and Garfunkely way – in a 1963 green VW Beetle with New Hampshire number plates that read ‘Live Free Or Die’. We thought we were very cool. I was raised on Kerouac, Brando and Eighties teen films. We loved REM and Talking Heads and wanted to pursue that alternative, eccentric America. In ’Frisco, we spent the night listening to blues busker Wet Willie at Fisherman’s Wharf, who played us Dylan songs on his acoustic guitar. What a start! I also tasted hummus for the first time. George had fallen in love with a girl in ’Frisco and we stayed at her folks’ home that first night. The second evening was spent sleeping in the Beetle under Golden Gate Bridge until the police moved us on. We were in no real hurry. There was no plan, and we had no money. Luckily, gas was only a dollar a gallon and McDonald’s had a promotion where you peeled off the sticker on a drink to get a free burger. At least, we seemed to get one every time we bought a soda. We headed down to Los Angeles to stay at George’s aunt’s and that was when I first encountered those amazing palm trees – just like the ones from Miami Vice , only not in Miami. We lunched at a diner called Patrick’s Roadhouse on the coast road, and overheard a movie producer talking about a project that was to star Cher. Cher! We really were in LA. The next day, Will read that Lou Reed was playing New York and the pair of them insisted we go. However, on our way the gig was cancelled after Lou broke his foot on a [guitar’s] wah pedal, and so a trip with no plan was thrown in a different direction. I remember the cassettes we played – Talking Heads, Green by REM and In My Tribe by 10,000 Maniacs – we’d seen Natalie Merchant play live at The Greek Theatre in LA during an eclipse. The trip was punctuated by a visit to George’s grandparents in Minneapolis as we headed up through America’s spine. We had been sleeping rough in the car – I was just under 6ft, Will was 6ft 2in and George was 6ft 3in – and we were shattered from the constant driving. Like three stick insects in a sardine tin. We must have smelt really ‘homely’. The three of us, still best friends, all followed our various dreams as soon as that trip ended We spent three weeks goofing around the US, ending up on the East Coast, where we gatecrashed Freshers’ Week at Nassau University. Girls and alcohol were involved. It was a great way to finish our epic road journey. Looking back, the drives down those wide open highways really were the stuff of film. You could project yourself on to those deserted scenes. This was also an analogue holiday, before mobile phones, internet and social media, and we were totally off the grid. I didn’t call my mother once – it was such a fuss to phone the UK – and so expensive. We were at a time when our lives were so undetermined. Years later, I lived in LA for a while and there’s a picture of me from the road trip ‘holding’ the Hollywood sign in my hand – as you do. Bizarrely, the apartment I’m standing in front of in the photo ended up being my home some 20 years later. The three of us, still best friends, followed our various dreams as soon as that trip ended. Will became a novelist, George an artist and I an actor. I genuinely think our paths were defined by that gap-year trip – the benchmark by which all my other road trips would be measured. A time when we were truly on the road, joyously lost in the United States of America.
