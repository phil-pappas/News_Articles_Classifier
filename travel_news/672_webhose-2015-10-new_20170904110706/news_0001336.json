Kilmer and Takai and to Sen. Hirono for standing up for a sensible travel policy for those working in defense of our nation.\n“Unfortunately, it is seemingly fashionable to try to indiscriminately cut government travel spending, though these misguided efforts mainly succeed in impeding the important functions of government agencies. For the same reason Congress needs to meet face-to-face, so do others—to develop trust and rapport, to take best advantage of critical education platforms such as conferences and conventions, and to capitalize on the proven and irreplaceable benefits of in-person collaboration.\n“We are confident that if this policy is reviewed by the General Accounting Office, the harmful effects of this travel policy will be laid plain for lawmakers to see and it will be reversed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:42:27.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
