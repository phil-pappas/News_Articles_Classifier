Our seventh hidden gem is Phetchabun, a province in the Lower North, 340 kilometres from Bangkok. \nUnseen Phetchabun \nIf you have not been to Switzerland, walked in an African savannah or experienced slow life in Luang Prabang, you can try all of them during a single trip to Phetchabun, one of the TAT’s dozen hidden gems. Then you will have no doubt why Phetchabun was selected. \nKhao Kho National Park, one of the most popular tourist destinations in Phetchabun, has been dubbed “Little Switzerland” due to its fresh air and beautiful landscape with a sea of mist, not only in the cool season but also during the rainy season. \nThe province also boasts Wat Phra That Pha Son Kaew, one of the top tourism sites among the Unseen Thailand Destinations and Dream Destination No.1 project of the TAT. \nThe temple, which offers a stunning view of Khao Kho, is decorated with Benjarong porcelain, tiles, glass beads, pearls, rings, silver, gold and numerous precious ornaments and enveloped by white fog. \nThe province is also home to Thung Salaeng Luang National Park, a 10-square-kilometre grassland surrounded by forests and hills, so people often call it the “Savannah of Thailand”. \nMore than 190 bird species have been found at the park including herons, eagles, partridges, owls, barbets, woodpeckers, bulbuls and flower peckers. \nNot surprisingly, Thung Salaeng Luang is a popular destination for wildlife photographers. \nLom Sak district is characterised by traditional Lao costumes and cuisine since most of the inhabitants’ ancestors had migrated from Luang Prabang. \nThe ambience of Lom Sak is similar to Luang Prabang’s, so it is called the “Luang Prabang of Thailand”, says Phetchabun Governor Bandit Teweetiwarak. \nApart from beautiful tourism sites, Phetchabun also has the potential to tap the agricultural tourism segment. \nThere is the largest cabbage farm in Thailand covering a total area of 12,000 rai at Phu Tub Berk in tambon Wang In, located 1,768 metres above sea level. \nThere are also strawberry and passion fruit farms. Strawberries are harvested from December-February, while passion fruit is produced in the rainy season, says Jirarat Meengam, director of the TAT’s Phitsanulok office. \nThe TAT is confident these fruits will help to promote Phetchabun’s agricultural tourism in the future. \nWith beautiful scenery of hills and forests, Phetchabun has many interesting and challenging cycling routes such as a 26-km route from Phu Hin Rong Kra to Phu Tub Berk and a mountain bike route in Thung Salaeng Luang National Park. \nTourism activities are very charming and unique such as the Um Phra Dam Nam (Dive Buddha Image into Water) festival. \nThis event is held annually at Wat Trai Phum on the 15th day of the waning moon in the 10th lunar month, which is called the Sat Thai period. \nWith this vast tourism potential, the TAT expects the number of tourists visiting Phetchabun will reach 2 million for tourism revenue of 6 billion baht this year, up from 1.84 million visitors and 5.4 billion baht last year. \nArrivals increased by 22% year-on-year to 700,000 in the first half of this year. \nPreparations \nThe Phetchabun Administrative Organization spent 20 million baht to turn the 40-km forest inspection trail into a mountain bike route to meet cycling demand. \nCyclists can pass through Thun Salaeng Luang National Park’s pine forest and savannah. It also plans to improve natural trekking trails in Nam Nao National Park. \nMr Bandit says the province has campaigned for the production of organic vegetables on Phu Tub Berk. \nA group of 300 farmers have joined the project since July, and organic cabbage plantations will be started soon. \nThey will gain more income from selling the produce to tourists and add more value to Phetchabun’s tourism as well. \nProblems and suggestions \nBoth the TAT and private tourism operators acknowledge Phetchabun is not as popular as Nan or Lampang, the other two hidden gem provinces in the North. \nLocals residing outside Khao Kho district have overlooked the importance of tourism since they do not receive any benefits. \n“Getting business operators and people in the other areas to cooperate is difficult because they don’t see the same thing,” says Ms Jirarat. \nThe TAT must work harder to promote collaboration and convince all parties that they can help boost Phetchabun’s tourism. \nMs Jirarat says the TAT has tried to educate people in many communities about potential tourism projects in Phetchabun. \nThe office has also found potential products to pool the cooperation and share the benefits of tourism. \nIn addition, the TAT’s tourism promotion drive for Phetchabun remains limited. \nIt promotes Phetchabun mainly as a cool-season tourist destination, the idea being the province should be visited only in the cool season even though there are many attractions in the rainy season. \nMs Jirarat also plans to promote the Caulokaempferia flower in Phu Hin Rong Kla National Park in the rainy season and wild flowers at Thung Salaeng Luang National Park in the hot season. \n“We want to educate everyone that they can travel to Phetchabun all year round. This will help to relieve crowding during the high season,” she says. \nThe occupancy rate during the high season is 90-100% on average, while during the low season it is only 20%. \nThe total number of hotel rooms stood at 5,034 last year, up from 4,655 in 2012. \n“We've received only a promotion budget of 1 million baht, so we must spend every single baht carefully,” Ms Jirarat says. \nAmnaj Srikeawfathong, president of the Khao Kho Club, says there is no garbage disposal plant at Khao Kho, so rubbish must be transported to a disposal plant on lower ground. \nDuring the high season, workers are unable to handle all the garbage in time, so some resort and hotel operators and vendors dump their garbage illegally on the roadside. \nMoreover, traffic congestion hits Khao Kho during long weekends. Therefore, it is essential to distribute tourists to other destinations in the province, he says. \nGrowth without direction in Phu Tub Berk tourism provides a case study for the other attractions. Tourism operators and the TAT accept that tourism growth brings prosperity, but if it happens without good management, it will affect the environment and lifestyle of local residents. \nEnvironmental problems are caused by the misuse of land with substandard bungalows built by hill tribe people who see business opportunities. \nThe buildings have damaged the beautiful landscape of Phu Tub Berk. \nTherefore, relevant authorities should meet local operators to transfer knowledge and advise them on tourism promotion to solve the problem before it is too late, says the TAT.
