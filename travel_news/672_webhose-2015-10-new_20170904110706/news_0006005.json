Then it erupts its fiery breath high in the sky, so that we all shriek and step back, like that could save us. SOPHIE PREECE/FAIRFAX NZ \nA cyclone ravaged dwelling at Lenakel on Tanna Island, Vanuatu. \nThe eruption is sustained for what seems like minutes, but is probably seconds, then dwindles, leaving a handful of paper-thin embers floating bright in the sky, whimsical as cellophane on the wind. \nThen, \"look away\", suggests our lovely guide, as she sits with her back to the crater and texts a friend, clearly immune to the drama of the moment. \nShe's had a lifetime living at the base of Mount Yasur, and more recently she's seen a cyclone tear every single leaf from the jungle, tear whole trees from the ground, and tear her brother's treehouse straight from its bough, flying it goodness knows where, like it's Kansas. SOPHIE PREECE/FAIRFAX NZ \nTanna Farms oil mill supervisor Julie Tevi. \nShe beams happily at us, but having been left without food, water and shelter after the grade five terror of Cyclone Pam in March, she perhaps considers our exclamations over the force of nature to be indulgent. I expect she's right. \nShe's certainly right to suggest we look away, as moments later the breeze carries gritty ash into our eyes and mouths, forcing us to turn our backs to the threat. \nIt's an incredible experience, but after an hour of fighting the flight response, I farewell the bubbling crater and walk the short track to the truck. It tears us back over the wonderful, wide black valley of ash, then over jarring dirt roads towards accommodation on the other side of the island. \nOn the way we pass the Mount Yasur View Lodge treehouse, where our guide's brother has rebuilt his gorgeous wee shack 20 metres up, so guests can see the glow of Yasur in the night sky, and hear its thunderous roar. Like the volcano it views, there's little health and safety to temper the thrill, and I wish I could stop and stay there. Ad Feedback \nIn the six months since Cyclone Pam the jungle has come back green and lush, although like many on Tanna, the people here long for the fruit and coconuts they once had in abundance. For now, like everywhere in Vanuatu six months on, they'll make do. \nA few hours later I am back at the gorgeous Tanna Evergreen Resort, where the beachfront fale are no less charming for wearing roofs of blue plastic, as they await the coconut fronds being delivered from other islands, to replace those whipped away by Pam. \nThe resort – don't think sterile formulaic complex, but a single open air restaurant, handful of familiar staff and some simple bure on the beach - is owned by a Ni-Vanuatu couple who worked for three years to clear their section and build three basic bungalows, before opening in 2000. \nMerian and Samuel Numake lost their entire honeymoon suite and suffered serious damage to the other fales, along with the walls and gorgeous gardens they'd worked so hard to build. \nThey also lost a great deal of hope and Merian says for two weeks they considered selling. Instead they rallied, and their staff got on board with an all-hands-on-deck project to get the resort open again, first for the onslaught of aid workers in April, and then for the return of tourists in July. \nThe rock walls were rebuilt, the gardens replanted, the bungalows repaired. \"It was like a jigsaw puzzle,\" says Merian. Now she has plans to rebuild and improve the Tanna Evergreen, making it better than ever. \nThis one will be a bit flasher, designed by an architect, and a bit tougher, prepared for future cyclones. \nThe next morning I wake early for breakfast at the edge of the turquoise sea, before setting off to explore Tanna with Marlborough man Jono Bushell, who co-owns Tanna Farms, a small business creating extra virgin coconut oil on the island. \nHe first came to Tanna eight years ago with his contract labour business Vinepower, which employs Ni-Vanuatu to work in New Zealand's horticultural sector during peak seasons, through the New Zealand Government's Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme. \nThe impact of the scheme is huge here, and in Vanuatu at large, with solar panels outside simple dwellings, the occasional concrete block home and more children able to go to school and the doctor. \nIn the wake of Pam, it's impacting even more, bringing sorely needed income to communities stripped of their gardens and coconut plantations. \nNinety percent of Jonah Robert's 500 coconut trees were knocked down by the category five cyclone in March. He has replanted his block in Waisisi, at the base of Mt Yasur, but it will take many years for the new trees to supply coconuts. \nThe RSE has given two of his sons work in New Zealand, with another going for the next season, and has been integral to the recovery of Tanna, he says. \nOne of Jonah's sons, John Nalpini, is at the island's capital Lenakel when I visit. He worked last summer in Marlborough and has also worked at the Tanna Farms coconut oil mill, before Pam tossed it into the jungle, 200 metres away. \nIt's nearly rebuilt, and the new version will be open for tours and have an additional space for processing peanuts – a market that's grown post Pam. \nWith coconut trees denuded or felled, and the oil mill destroyed, Tanna Farms started buying and drying peanuts, lathering them in coconut oil and roasting them with local garlic. I eat three packs in the course of one morning, doing my bit for the recovery. \nI follow them with the delicious manioc chips Tanna Farms business partner Germaine Koniamek cooks in coconut oil amid the factory build, then we head off to the home she shares with husband Seth Kaurua. \nThere we climb a ladder to her sun baked roof, and pull back a tarpaulin to reveal nuts drying, so she can shell them for roasting. Jono's weekly \"nut job\" - packing a woven basket, jumping on his motorbike and delivering peanuts to pubs and resorts of Vanuatu's main island Efate – is going gangbusters, and the team are buying and drying every nut they can get, and urging growers to plant more of the quick growing crop, while they wait for a coconut harvest. \nThen it's back to Evergreen for a swim in the sea, via the vibrant Lenekal market, via wild horses grazing at the side of the road, via coffee plantations bearing berries again, and via the friendly waves of machete wielding men on their way to or from gardens or the market. Via children in their Unicef backpacks, with shiny new school roofs along with temporary tents. \nWe pass roadworks on the way, their promise of smoother transits across the island surely paving the way for many more tourists. I'm glad, for the sake of the people of Tanna, and for the travellers who will discover a raw and gritty piece of paradise, including the roaring mountain at its heart. But I'm also glad I got there before them. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:15:38.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
