Unfortunately i just checked that Taj is closed on friday. Can anybody suggest me if I hire a car from Delhi and leave Delhi on 31th Oct around 1 am I might reach Agra at 5 am and see sunrise in Taj mahal. Will I be able to come back in Delhi by 2 pm? How long normally people has to wait in the queue for seeing Taj? Is it safe to travel in that road during night? Please suggest some option for budget car hire service in Delhi.
