Travel Smart Study \nThe cheapest time to book hotels is in the first two weeks of January when room rates are below average, according to Agoda.com, the hotel booking website. \nThe result is part of its \"Travel Smart study\" which is based on booking data through its website in 2014. The study analysed hotel prices at 25 of the world's popular tourist destinations to help travellers find the best hotel deals. \n\"For many travellers, price is the most important factor in deciding when and where to go. This data can help our customers get the most out of their money,\" said John Brown, chief operating officer of Agoda.com. \nThe most expensive period for booking an accommodation is during the months of September and October. On average, a hotel room in Berlin, for example, costs 51% more in September compared to January. \nWhen segmented in to city destinations, mid-March is the time to visit Europe because hotel rooms in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Stockholm and London are 20% cheaper than average. \nJuly is considered high season in many popular destinations, but hotel rooms in Sydney and New York are cheaper than average. The last week in December, also considered high season in most destinations, is the time to travel to Stockholm. \nIn contrast to hotel room rates in Europe, the rates in Asia's popular destinations such as Bangkok, Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore are consistent throughout the year and discounts aren't too dramatic, he noted.
