SRP is evolving the retail industry through a concentrated effort to densify the shopper experience with retail, office and entertainment options.\nSRP purchased The Shops at Willow Bend in October, 2014, and began a $100 million redesign to overhaul the dated space and create a revitalized complex to meet the demands of Plano's growing population. The addition will include a highly visible, new main entrance facing the Dallas North Tollway that will communicate a sense of arrival to shoppers, diners and guests. The redevelopment will begin with the replacement of a 125,000-square foot vacant building with a new structure designed exclusively for best in-class retailers and restaurants. The redesign will also include a contemporary hotel and office tower.\n\"Throughout the country, consumers are looking for conveniences in one space and we're seeing the same need for those synergies in Plano ,\" said Scott Wolstein , CEO of Starwood Retail Partners. \" Plano deserves a better, more accessible option from the tollway and its new 'front door' will be just the start. Consumers have been waiting for a retail environment where they can relax, enjoy and connect. With The Shops at Willow Bend, we're giving it to them.\"\nOne of 30 mall properties owned and operated by SRP, The Shops at Willow Bend will be another addition to a successful portfolio of restored spaces where guests enjoy themselves and make meaningful connections in a comfortable, stimulating environment.
