McMurdo Sea Ice Runways, Antarctica\nPlunging towards Antarctica can prove to be an experience as cold as ice.\nGiven that less than 0.4% of the continent consists of bare ground, with the remainder comprising ice and snow, airplanes are expected to land on a sheet of ice carved annually instead of a traditional, paved runway, according to the Encyclopedia of the Antarctic.\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg.\nAircrafts weighing up to 300 tons have landed on these runways with an ice thickness of 8 feet, according to the Encyclopedia of Antarctica, but pilots are required to carefully sidestep heavy landings and aircrafts are closely monitored to ensure they don't sink too deep into the ice.\n2. Princess Juliana International Airport, St. Maarten\nThe sandy beaches of St. Maarten lure a slew of tourists looking to unwind and take in some rays.\nBut respite is regularly disrupted by airplanes flying at a very low altitude above sunbathers’ heads.\nThe airport has a runway so short, with one end adjacent to Maho Beach, that beach-goers can nearly graze the engines of incoming jets.\nBut just as the low-flying airplanes make for an ideal photo-op, they also stir gusts of wind upwards of 100 mph, ABC News reported , nearly blowing away tourists — both literally and figuratively.\n3. Juancho E. Yrausquin Airport, Saba, Netherlands Antilles\nThe Dutch Caribbean island of Saba is home to the world's shortest commercial runway — a curt 1,300 feet long, according to the island’s tourism site .\nIf that doesn't incite enough terror, the landing strip, which is perched at a high altitude itself, is flanked by hills on one side and the end of the runway drops over a cliff suspended above the ocean.\nBecause of the runway's diminutive size, only one airline, Winair, is allowed to fly in and out of this airport.\n4. Madeira International Airport, Madeira, Portugal\nPassengers brace for landing at this coastal airport — featuring a runway on a bridge that juts out from a hillside and hovers over the ocean.\nThe viaduct is held up by a row of columns that resemble rickety stilts from a bird’s eye view.\nFollowing a fatal crash landing in 1977, engineers concluded that the more than 5,000-foot-long runway would no longer fly, and have since nearly doubled its length to over 9,000 feet, according to the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering.\nStill, pilots are required to undergo additional training just to safely land on this terrifying tarmac.\n© Provided by New York Daily News A handful of airports around the world are taking trepidation to new heights with these terrifying runways. - Niranjan Shrestha/AP 5. Kansai International Airport, Osaka, Japan\nFor all those brazen thrill-seekers out there, who crave the adrenaline rush of nose-diving into the sea — catch a jet to this Japanese airport.\nFrom aerial view, the two runways appear to float in the middle of Osaka Bay.\nThe airport landing strips are constructed on an artificial island to mitigate noise pollution for residents closeby, and is connected to the mainland by a bridge, CNN reported.\nNevertheless, because of its illusion, dropping down toward this airport peninsula frequently leaves patrons in a cold sweat.\n6. Don Mueang International Airport, Bangkok, Thailand\nThis airport is one of the oldest to still operate in Asia — but that’s not what sends chills up passengers’ spines.\nWhat makes this airport as bone-chilling as it is bizarre, is that the landing strips are wedged between a golf course.\nThat's right — putters play holes in between two main runways, often donning noise-canceling headphones while teeing off, to drown out the deafening hums of jet engines, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nThe proximity of planes tend to be a lure for golfers, but for flyers, the sight of swinging golf clubs below is more worriseome than winsome.\n7. Lukla Airport, Nepal\nNestled in the mountainous region of Nepal, the mere 1,500-foot-long landing strip sits at a 12% incline at an altitude of 9,000 feet, according to Atlas Obscura.\nThe end of the runway features a hair-raising 2,000-foot drop off a cliff, and when flights take off, passengers plunge before ascending — inducing a healthy amalgam of nausea and panic.\n8. Gibraltar International Airport, Gibraltar\nAir and road traffic collide at this risky establishment — the Gibraltar Airport is the sole airport in the world that has a functioning street intersecting a runway.\nThat means that every time a flight lands or departs, Winston Churchill Avenue, which is the main street connecting to the city, is temporarily shut down for an average of 10 minutes, according to Atlas Obscura.\nTo make the landing experience even more terrifying, planes plummet towards a giant, jagged limestone rock that adjoins the runways.\n9. Gisborne Airport, New Zealand\nIf plunging into incoming traffic doesn’t cause hairs to raise, then perhaps diving towards an operating railroad track might do the trick.\nTrains regularly travel across the runway at Gisborne Airport, causing an actual barrier for flights to land.\nThe planes and trains inevitably coordinate schedules, but the sight of carriages crosscutting the runway as aircrafts descend causes quite a stir.\n10. Paro Airport in Bhutan, Himalayan Mountains\nDipping down towards the Himalayan Mountains is such an arduous task, that only eight pilots in the world are licensed to land on this runway.\nWhat makes the descent such a chilling challenge is that the whopping 18,000-feet-high peaks of mountains encircling the tarmac renders the puny 6,500-foot-long landing strip much shorter than its elevation, according to Atlas Obscura.\nAnd since the runway is ensconced in some of the steepest cliffs in the world, the often windy conditions causes anxiety levels to soar as passengers plummet toward this Asian region.\nbrobins@nydailynews.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/gibraltar-airport", "http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/lukla-airport", "http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/10/travel/dramatic-airport-approaches/", "http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/paro-airport", "https://books.google.com/books?id=fRJtB2MNdJMC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=ice+runway+antarctica&source=bl&ots=dmfT1slGGn&sig=ui8HlaN5n2W4Ku9y9nN0Ie0z60c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBTgKahUKEwjM49_R6NPIAhXM1R4KHUFuBwc#v=onepage&q=ice%20runway%20antarctica&f=false", "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2011/11/st-maartens-extreme-airport-a-caribbean-paradise-for-thrill-seekers-aviation-enthusiasts/", "http://www.iabse.org/IABSE/association/Organisation_files/Outstanding_Structure_Award/Funchal_Airport_Extension__Madeira_Island__Portugal_.aspx", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116079173247792806", "http://www.sabatourism.com/sabasairport.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:59:58.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
