The truth is that most people just aren't training correctly: if your form is not right throughout your workout, you will be unable to contract the necessary muscle to maximum effect. When adopting new exercises for bigger arms, then, slow them down and try to establish a strong connection between the mind and the muscle. If you focus on that and a gradual increase in weights, you're sure to make progress. Biceps Barbell bicep curl A classic mass-building exercise for the biceps. Be sure to contract your abdominals throughout and keep tight form, no swinging! If you move about, you're robbing the biceps of necessary stimulation. For this, you'll need a comfortable, weighted barbell. First, bend down and grasp your bar Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart and palms facing the ceiling Bring the bar up with your arms bent, so the bar is level with your belly button Raise/curl the bar up and in, towards the chest Pause Lower the bar back down to the belly button, then repeat Cable bicep curl The cable bicep curl is a great exercise, providing resistance throughout the movement. It's a particularly good exercise for tension at the top of the movement, so keep your tempo slow and co-ordinated throughout the exercise. You will need to attach a straight bar onto the low pulley Grasp the bar with both hands and bring it up so it is just below the waist Curl the bar up into the chest Pause Lower back down to waist level, then repeat One arm dumbbell preacher curl Perform this exercise seated, as an excellent one-arm isolation exercise to hit the biceps hard. You will need a comfortable weighted dumbbell and a preacher bench. Sit down, rest your elbows on the pads while your arm is extended Curl the dumbbell up towards the chest Pause Lower the dumbbell back down, then repeat Barbell drag curl Not an exercise you see very often but the drag curl is a great compound move for the arms that will give your biceps a good burn whilst also stimulating your forearms. You will need a comfortable weighted barbell Stand up straight with the barbell in both hands in front of you, with a supinated grip (palms facing up) Curl the bar up towards your chest while exhaling and dragging your elbows behind the torso Pause Lower the bar back down bringing your elbows back in line with your torso, then repeat Triceps Close grip barbell bench press This is great for building up the triceps, and an easy inclusion for 'chest day'. You will need a flat bench under a squat rack, with a barbell above your bench set to a comfortable weight Lie flat on the bench with your feet on the floor and grasp the bar with a close grip, lifting it off the rack Make sure the barbell is in line with your chest Inhale, and lower the bar into your chest, but avoid the two touching Pause Raise the bar back up to the starting position, and do it all again Triceps kick back This is my personal favourite tricep exercise. It provides a very deep burn on the muscle, and is great for carving out upper arm definition. You'll need a comfortable weighted dumbbell and a flat bench: Rest one knee on the bottom of the bench and one hand at the top Grasp the dumbbell and bring the arm up, so the elbow Is bent and the weight is level with your chest Begin to extend the arm backwards until you can go no further, while keeping a slight bend in the elbow Pause Bring the arm back in towards the chest, then repeat Triceps dips on a bench Dips are a great exercise for the triceps, and can be done on either parallel bars or even weighted. You'll need a flat bench for this one: Place your hands on the edge of the bench, slightly behind your torso, and place your legs straight out in front of you so you are resting on your heels Lower your body (only using your arms) until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle and parallel to the floor Pause Raise your body back up, again using your arms only, then repeat Close grip pull down This exercise can be used with different grips to stimulate the different 'heads' of the tricep. The ease of changing weight makes it particularly convenient for drop sets. You'll need a straight bar attached to a high cable attachment Stand with feet shoulder width apart Grasp the bar with both hands with a close grip Slowly pull the bar down until level with your belly button Pause Raise the bar back up to head height Repeat Forearms Wrist circles The forearms and wrist take quite a pounding from weight training, and this is compounded of you do any kind of upper body plyometrics, boxing or racquet sports. These mobility exercises will help you maintain healthy range of motion through your wrists. Stand up straight with hands by your sides Bring your arms up slightly Move your wrists in circular motions one way, then the other, before repeating Barbell Reverse Grip curl A great mass building exercise for the forearms. Though these muscles generally get worked hard through other exercises, training them in isolation is an excellent way to build strength and muscle mass. Grasp bar with wide overhand grip With elbows at your side raise the bar until forearms are vertical Lower until arms are fully extended, then repeat How to put it all together All these exercises can either be constructed into an 'arms day' themselves or included in other schedules. For people that follow a 5 day split bodybuilding routine, the below regime is what I would recommend: may want to follow workout regime similar to the one below: Monday - Shoulders Tuesday - Legs Wednesday - Arms Thursday - Back + Traps Friday - Chest Saturday - Rest Sunday - Rest On this routine the arms day could be split like this: • Barbell curl/Close grip bench press: 4 sets of 6-8 reps (superset) • Cable Bicep Curl/Tricep dips on bench: 4 sets of 6-8 reps (superset) • One arm preacher curl: 3 sets of 10 reps • Tricep kick back: 3 sets of 10 reps • Tricep pull down: drop set (4 different weights) • Bicep cable curl: drop set (4 different weights) • Reverse grip barbell curl: 3 sets of 10 • Wrist circles: 3 sets of 30 seconds Alternatively, you could split up your arm exercises and add them to other workouts. Some like to add triceps to a chest workout and biceps to a back workout, for instance, since the muscles will already be pre-exhausted. Others do the reverse, so the arm muscles are relatively fresh going into the workout. It is a good idea to vary this over your training phases. For example the supersets alone from the workout may be an isolated enough stimulation on an already pre-exhausted muscle group. So if you do feel like your arms are a weaker body part, I would recommend giving them their own training day, or at least some additional sets in order to bring them up to par with the rest of your physique.
