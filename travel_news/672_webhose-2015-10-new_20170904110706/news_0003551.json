But experts say there's no need to fret â€” this year's foliage season was delayed slightly because of weather conditions and is likely to end up being just as spectacular. It may even last a little longer than usual, which is good for the economy.\n___\n\nIn this Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, photo, Bruce Hughes, of Hudson, N.H., paddles past trees turning color while heading out to fish for rainbow trout at Canobie Lake in Salem, N.H. New England's fall foliage is a little less glorious this autumn, as experts say a hotter than usual September and a dearth of rainfall are two reasons for the late and largely muted color display. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa) \nWHY THE LATE START?\nThe leaves turn when the nights get colder and the days shorten. But it's been a mild fall so far. Deciduous trees, including oaks, maples, beech and birch, spend the spring and summer growing food for the winter, and shorter days and cooler nights signal that it's time to shed the leaves and go into dormancy, said Paul Catanzaro, an extension assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who specializes in forest ecology and conservation.\n\"We've had this slow descent into the cooler temperatures, and that's kept leaves on the trees longer and extended the season,\" he said.\nFoliage season in Massachusetts has been delayed a week to 10 days, said Bill Simpson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Taunton.\n\"The usual overnight cold snaps that trigger the transition have been delayed,\" he said.\n___\nWHAT'S THE ECONOMIC IMPACT?\nThe late arrival of colour in Vermont hasn't deterred visitors. Leaf peepers tend to make plans well before the fall.\n\"What we've found is that many of our visitors are here on scheduled (bus) tours so they make arrangements for these tours well in advance and they're going to come rain, shine, leaves or no leaves,\" said Marti Austin, retail manager for Cold Hollow Cider Mill in Waterbury Center, which had its best Columbus Day weekend in 40 years.\nIn the Berkshires of western Massachusetts, hotels, inns, restaurants and other businesses that cater to leaf peepers were packed over a spectacular Columbus Day weekend, said Lindsey Schmid, marketing director at the Berkshires Visitors Bureau.\nThe hope now is that those visitors will return to see the foliage at peak, and more spur-of-the-moment visitors will make the trip.\n\"Innkeepers and restaurateurs are pushing out more deals, getting the word out to their customers and saying 'You need to make your plans still,'\" she said.\n___\nARE THERE ANY COMPLAINTS?\nBritni White, executive director of the North Country Chamber of Commerce in New Hampshire, said the final tallies aren't in yet but she expects businesses will report a better season because of the delayed colours. In Maine, peak foliage has yet to take hold for the entire state.\n\"We've been granted another week of foliage by our warm September,\" Maine fall foliage co-ordinator Gale Ross said. \"You know, I don't think anyone's complaining.\"\n____\nWHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE?\nDon't worry, said Catanzaro, the UMass professor. \"I've never seen a foliage season that's disappointed me, and I think this is a really good one,\" he said.\nCan winter weather be predicted by fall conditions?\nSimpson, the government meteorologist, says no. It's impossible to say whether New England will suffer through another brutal winter.\nBut just in case, enjoy the fall.\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Rik Stevens in Concord, New Hampshire; Lisa Rathke in Montpelier, Vermont; and Patrick Whittle in Portland, Maine, contributed to this report.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:07:41.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
