An earlier concert, on Thursday 26th November, will feature an A-list line-up of Arabic stars, including DJ Said Mrad, the guru of Arabic electronic music, and Cheb Khaled, who helped propel Arabic music onto the global stage. \nThe after-race concerts are part of the annual Yasalam Festival, the largest city-wide entertainment programme run by any F1 host city. Other Yasalam highlights include a carnival-style Opening Parade along the Corniche boardwalk; Beats on the Beach, the UAE’s biggest free music festival; and an official F1 FanZone™. Only those that have purchased a Grand Prix ticket from Yas Marina Circuit, the race venue, will be able to attend the exclusive after-race concerts, which will take place in Abu Dhabi’s du Arena on Yas Island. Demand for the 60,000 tickets is expected to be at an all-time high following 2014’s record-breaking, sell-out race weekend. The world’s only twilight race will be the last of the 2015 season, and could once again decide the prestigious F1 Drivers’ Championship. There will be an unmissable opportunity for ticketholders to see the teams up close during a public pit lane walk on the afternoon of Thursday 26th November. While those enjoying corporate hospitality in the new Marsa Boxes and Suites will get the chance to rub shoulders with a range of global stars, including F1 racing legend Mark Webber. Organisers are encouraging race fans to book their tickets fast, as some categories are already sold out, with limited availability in other areas. Fans can also download the YasHUB app from Apple and Android stores. Specially created by Yas Marina Circuit, no other F1 app allows the level of experience control offered by YasHUB. With augmented reality integration, racegoers can fully unlock their ticket’s potential and can not only select their seating, but can also see the view from their chosen seat, right on their smartphone. With maps, news and all the latest information, users can ignite their experience with YasHUB. Yas Marina Circuit has also announced that a few lucky fans will be able to win race tickets by tuning in to the circuit’s social media platforms and joining the #AbuDhabiGP activations.
