We improved margins,\" Moeller said. \"As a result, we're making good money in India and the growth we have going forward will be worth something.\" \nP&G revised its fiscal 2016 sales outlook and now expects net sales to be down \"high single digits\" as compared with the July forecast for a fall of \"low-to-mid single digits.\" \nThe shift is due to minor brand divestitures and the impact of a revision in its accounting of the Venezuela business due to a series of foreign exchange policy changes in the South American country. \nMoeller said P&G has hiked prices of some goods in Russia due to the strong dollar, but has seen lower volumes there. The company is monitoring consumer response to recent price increases in Brazil. \nNet (LSE: 0LN0.L - news ) income in the quarter rose 30.7 percent to $2.6 billion. The favorable year-over-year comparison was due to the impact of a charge in the year-ago period related to divestitures. \nEarnings from continuing operations translated into 98 cents per share in the quarter ending September 30, better than the 95 cents projected by analysts. \nP&G in the last year has divested its Duracell battery business and dozens of beauty and fragrance brands, part of a makeover to emphasize the company's biggest sellers, such as Pampers and Gillette. \nIn July, the company announced it was promoting David Taylor to chief executive beginning November 1. \nMorgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) said P&G's underlying results were \"weak,\" but praised the improvement in profit margins. \n\"All in all, we would declare today a victory vs expectations,\" Morgan Stanley said. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Dow member P&G jumped 2.6 percent to $76.78 in early trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:55:36.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
