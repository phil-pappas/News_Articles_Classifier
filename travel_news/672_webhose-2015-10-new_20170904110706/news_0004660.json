More Small-cap Week, October 24 \nBaidu ’s US-listed shares soared more than 9 per cent in premarket trading on news of the deal. Shares in Qunar rose 24 per cent, while Ctrip.com shares were up 14.34 per cent. \nThe deal comes just five months after Qunar, which has a market value of $5.2bn, rejected an unsolicited buyout offer from Ctrip.com, which has a market capitalisation of $10.6bn. Both companies are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. \nIntense competition between internet companies in China means market leaders are often under heavy pressure to subsidise consumers as a way of gaining market share. But in recent months, investors have been pushing these companies to merge and reduce marketing costs. \nQunar has been the fastest-growing online travel agency in China this year, but the company has incurred heavy losses, and its margins come under pressure, in part because of its discounting and coupon strategy. \nEarlier this month, the need to consolidate triggered the merger between Meituan.com and Dianping Holdings — which handle “online to offline” services such as group buy, food delivery and restaurant reviews. We believe this [transaction] will create greater value to our customers, partners and shareholders in the future \n- James Liang, Ctrip’s chief executive \nThat followed the merger in February between Alibaba-backed Kuaidi Dache and Tencent’s Didi Dache, the taxi-hailing applications, after the two engaged in a costly subsidy and price war. \nOnline travel is booming in China as a growing middle class spends more on leisure and entertainment. But the sector has also become increasingly competitive, with rival internet giant Alibaba beefing up its travel offering through its Alitrip website last year. \n“We believe this [transaction] will create greater value to our customers, partners and shareholders in the future,” James Liang, Ctrip’s chief executive and chairman, said in a statement . \nRobin Li, Baidu chief executive, said: “We are happy with Qunar’s accomplishments, and we look forward to working with the leading players in the industry.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:25:19.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
