A professional instructor has a toolbox of skills to help children learn on the slopes without being a danger to themselves or others. But recently I've realised that many parents have decided to take it upon themselves to teach their kids how to ski, rather than using an instructor, to save money. I’ve witnessed first-hand a dad try to teach his five-year-old son how to ski after only a few weeks of experience himself. The results were comical yet terrifying. This kid was running rampant on the piste and was totally out of control. The parent didn’t have a clue how to address the situation – funny, yes, but he was actually putting his son in danger.

MORITZ The thought of saving money early in a child’s ski development may seem like a good idea to begin with, but later on it’s bound to come back to haunt you. Good technique taught right from the off enables skiers to have a basic platform from which to improve their technique. Most instructors will be hot on safety too, so that youngsters will learn the ski way code, which is a vital part of being on the mountain. Please think twice before becoming a have-a-go ski instructor For budget-conscious parents, a great-value way of getting your kids their first lessons is to look closer to home. Dry slopes and snow centres in the UK always have a wide range of beginner classes available. Children can learn good basic skills in a closed environment before heading out to the crowded pistes. A quick internet search will pinpoint your nearest ski slope and help you find the best place for your little one’s needs. When you learn from a qualified instructor, it gives you a solid platform to improve from Coming from a racing background, I’ve found that having good feedback and learning solid basic technique as a child has developed my skiing no end. I’ve also gone through parts of the British Association of Snowsport Instructors (BASI) system, and it was interesting to hear how even the slightest use of the wrong terminology can confuse people who are trying to learn to ski.

The pistes are already full of hazards; having out of control little nippers as well doesn’t help. The investment is definitely worth it in the future.
