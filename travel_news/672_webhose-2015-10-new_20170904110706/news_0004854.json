I initially came over for a holiday to see my two brothers who were living here at the time (one still is). I found the weather and lifestyle fantastic coming from an Auckland winter. Once I returned to Auckland I decided to move to the Gold Coast for a little while - and here I am 27 years later. \nWhat do you do there? I work at Griffith University in the accounts payable department. We have a great bunch of people and I have worked here coming up eight years. It suits me as I was allowed to return to work part-time after maternity leave. I will return to full-time once my daughter goes to school next year. DAVID GRAY \nThe Hart family have made the popular tourist destination their home. \nWhat are the greatest advantages to living there? Of course the weather is a plus but also the housing prices are much more affordable than Auckland. I am told wages are higher here, possibly as the tax is not quite as high. \nDisadvantages? On the downside, the summer is way too hot for me and to drive place tends to be long distances. There are very few big rugby games and of course, Kiwis cop a lot of grief here. The worst thing is the bugs! \nHow expensive is it compared to New Zealand? How much is a beer? The cost of groceries and clothing is relatively the same. It's been a long time since I lived in New Zealand so I am going by what visitors say. A carton of 24 stubbies, 330ml, is around $40. There is a bigger variety to choose from here with both clothing and food. Kiwi expats: What's your tale? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nWhat do you do in your spare time? I have a 5-year-old so we tend to spend a lot of time at the beach and at parks. There are a lot of great kid-oriented parks where you can have picnics. It is pretty much always the weather to have a BBQ or fish and chips in the evening somewhere nice. \nWhat's the local delicacy and would you recommend eating it? I would say the local delicacy would be Moreton Bay bugs. I would highly recommend them on the BBQ with garlic and butter. Similar to crayfish I suppose, it really is a seafood lover's paradise here. \nEasiest way to get around? You really need a car here to get around. We have just got a light rail which is fantastic but it does not cover enough areas yet. An extension is in the pipeline. \nWhat's the shopping like? There are plenty of shopping centres so there's quite a variety. Not the sort of shopping you get in Sydney or Melbourne though. Ad Feedback \nBest after-dark activity? After dark there is plenty to do. If you're my age, it's great restaurants, cafes or nice bars on the water with beautiful ocean views. If you're in your 20s or into the nightclub scene you have plenty of choice. I do prefer the New Zealand bars - they seem to have much more character. \nBest time of year to visit? Best time of year to visit is September to November. December through March is too hot for my liking and winter a bit cool (for Aussies anyway) \nWhat are the top things you recommend for visitors? I would recommend visitors see that the Gold Coast is more than just beautiful beaches and theme parks. The Hinterland has some lovely wineries and rainforest walks/picnic spots. \nBesides family and friends, what do you miss most about home? I miss the colours of the season changes in New Zealand, being able to go to Eden Park for the rugby and the passion Kiwis feel for the All Blacks. I love the pubs and the friendly attitude people have. The Gold Coasters can be a bit stand-offish, especially if you're from New Zealand, even after 27 years. \nHow easy is it for you to get back to NZ? Getting home is easy, there are always cheap flights. I try to get back on a regular basis as my parents and brother are still in Auckland. \nFor Kiwis looking to move there, which industries are seeking fresh talent? It's not easy finding work on the Gold Coast as it is not a big city. Hospitality and tradespeople are sought after. I found when you initially move there it is even more difficult as employers tend to think you might not stick around for long. \nIf you know an expat who wants to share inside knowledge of their home away from home, hit the green Contribute button or email escape@star-times.co.nz with Expat in the subject line. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:25:34.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
