Since July, Creative China activities have been lighting up theatres, concert halls and auditoriums nationwide as well as helping to bring together creative industries in both countries. The programme is part of a year-long campaign by the Chinese and British governments to encourage greater cultural exchanges. Geographical distance should be no barrier to cultural exchange “Both countries have a splendid history, strong traditions and are keen on innovation and creation,” said Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to Britain. “Geographical distance should be no barrier to cultural exchange.” Treading the Bard's boards: the cast of Richard III acknowledges applause at the Globe Theatre The latest event, 100% Design, an exhibition of the best in Chinese design, opened at the Olympia London in late September to coincide with the London Design Festival. Organised by a team from Shanghai, the show came shortly after the people behind Shanghai Fashion Week co-organised a forum on the city’s urban fashion and creativity aimed at encouraging potential collaboration. “We’re delighted to see the forum was able to provide the audience with a greater understanding of the scene in Shanghai and China,” said Lyu Xiaolei, one of the organisers. We hope it communicates Shanghai’s ambition to become a key player on the international stage “We hope it will communicate Shanghai’s ambition to become a key player on the international stage in the fashion and creative industries.” In August Chinese pianist Lang Lang performed a well-received recital at Usher Hall during the Edinburgh International Festival, playing Bach’s Italian Concerto, Tchaikovsky’s The Seasons and Chopin’s Four Scherzos. The People’s Liberation Army Military Band also made an appearance in the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo, which first took place in 1950. On the stage China’s National Theatre’s Mandarin version of Richard III received a warm welcome at the Globe Theatre. Catherine Mallyon, executive director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, said the RSC was also working with experts to research Chinese classics for translation into English as part of the cultural exchange program. We expect to find the artistic creations of China during the time when Shakespeare lived “Working with Chinese colleagues, we expect to find the artistic creations of China during the time when Shakespeare lived,” she said, adding that the results of the research would be announced in the coming months. Scotland’s National Theatre and Tianjin Children’s Art Theater jointly performed Dragon, a play for all the family that featured high-octane movement, puppetry and original music, while the Changxing Lotus Dragon Dance Folklore Group from east China made their debut in Edinburgh in the summer, too. In addition to cultural performances, Creative China has also featured trade and industry events, such as the Shenzhen-Edinburgh International Creative Industry Incubation Centre and a design forum at the Victoria and Albert Museum. It also included competitions such as Amazing China, a global mobile phone contest organised by China Daily and the Royal Photographic Society that o ered prizes for the best shots of China. This was the first Year of Cultural Exchange between China and Britain, with the programme agreed during Premier Li Keqiang’s visit in June last year. The first half was British season and the second half was Chinese season. • Discover more fascinating articles at China Daily • Find more news, analysis and features at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:33:34.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
