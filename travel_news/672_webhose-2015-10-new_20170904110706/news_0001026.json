Commenting on the report, an analyst said: \"EPBs replace the handbrake and foot pedal with a control switch and electrical cables. This simplifies routing and provides opportunities to automobile interior designers. The replacement also provides interior space for the manufacturers to add safety and entertainment features. In addition, the usage of EPB reduces the gross weight of the vehicle and thereby increases fuel economy.\"\nAccording to this 2015 electric parking brake market report, rising concerns about passenger safety have compelled automobile manufacturers to implement the integration of various safety systems. For instance, many high-end vehicles are equipped with rear back-up cameras, which help to prevent accidents during reversing. Automobile and EPB manufacturers plan to integrate EPBs with rear cameras, which will automatically stop the vehicle when an obstacle is detected.\nFurther, the report states that an EPB system is an electronically controlled system and requires professional expertise for technical services such as changing brake pads. However, the automotive aftermarket is currently not sufficiently equipped to meet the requirements of EPB maintenance. EPB technicians require the use of a diagnostic laptop to open the calipers and change the brake pads. This leads to an increase in the maintenance cost of these systems which may cause a bit of hindrance to growth of electric parking brake market.\nCompanies active in the electric parking brake market and mentioned in this research include Aisin Seiki, Continental ZF TRW, Advics, DURA Automotive Systems, Hyundai, KUSTER Automotive, and SKF.

The report covers EMEA, APAC, and the Americas; it also covers the landscape of the global electric parking brake market and its growth prospects in the coming years. The report includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market.\nOn a related note, the Brake System Market by Application (PC, LCV, HCV, Off-Highway, Wagon, Locomotive, and RTV), Type (Disc and Drum), Technology (ABS, TCS, ESC, and EBD), Rolling Stock and Locomotive (Air, EP, ECP, and others), and Region - Global Forecast to 2020 research report says rising safety concerns and regulations have resulted in a boom in the electronically assisted brake market. These factors have increased the penetration of electronic stability control and anti-lock braking systems across the globe. These technologies are estimated to account for over 75% of the market in 2015 and are projected to acquire majority of the market in the next few years. With advancements in automotive brakes, the braking system in off-highway vehicles, locomotive and rolling stock too is witnessing a growth curve. Both the markets, in terms of volume, are projected to grow at promising CAGRs during from 2015 to 2020. Companies like ZF TRW Automotive Holdings Corporation, Continental AG, Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd., Akebono Brake Industry Co. Ltd., Mando Corporation, Brembo S.P.A., Federal-Mogul Holdings Corporation, Haldex AB, Knorr-Bremse AG and Nissin Kogyo Co., Ltd. are profiled in this research available at http://www.reportsnreports.com/reports/237861-automotive-brake-system-market-by-geography-brake-type-disc-drum-vehicle-type-passenger-cars-light-heavy-commercial-two-wheelers-technology-electronically-assisted-others-global-trends-forecast-to-2018.html .\nExplore more reports on the automotive market at http://www.reportsnreports.com/market-research/automotive/ .\nAbout Us:\nReportsnReports.com is an online market research reports library of 500,000+ in-depth studies of over 5000 micro markets.
