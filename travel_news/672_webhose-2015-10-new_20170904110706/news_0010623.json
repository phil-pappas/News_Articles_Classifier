Thongs? \nIf you were in Australia and you said thongs were those skimpy pieces of underwear and swimwear won by women (much like a G-string) in, say, the US, well, you would be wrong. \nThongs in Australia are, well, not as sexy as thongs in America. \nAussie thongs are basic footwear consisting of a sole and a thong passing between the first and second toes of the feet and affixed in a Y formation on three points to the sole. \nThey're your basic sandal, mate, and they're also called jandals, slippers or go=aheads in some parts of the world. \nIn New Zealand, because of the sound they make, they're called flip-flops. \nIf you're imagining a bronzed Aussie beach girl in what Americans call a thong, you may be looking in the wrong direction. You have to look down at her feet to see if she's wearing thongs. \nAh, the disillusion caused by language.
