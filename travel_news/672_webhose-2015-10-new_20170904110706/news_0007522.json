It is also the first time The Residence, Etihad Airways’ suite-class seats, is being introduced on the route. \n\n\n“Melbourne is an important point on our global network, and our Abu Dhabi to Melbourne services continue to generate very high seat load factors on a year round basis. After just three months of operations, demand for our second daily service is already exceeding our expectations,” said James Hogan, president and CEO of Etihad Airways. \n\n“Deploying the 496-seat A380 to Melbourne will enable us to accelerate our growth in the Victorian market by providing additional capacity, particularly in business class, where demand for seats continually outstrips supply.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:49:07.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
