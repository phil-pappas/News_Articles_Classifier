But few celebrations are planned.\nSchool children were supposed to dress up last Friday in the traditional garb of one of Costa Rica’s many cultures. Some did, some didn’t.\nStill, we have made progress from the days, at least in the U.S., where school kids dutifully colored cutouts of the Nina (actually la Niña ), Pinta and Santa María and came away thinking that Columbus was an undisputed hero. Among the educational Columbus Day resources suggested by the National Education Association, the teachers labor union, are an essay by the American Indian Movement’s Russell Means and Glenn Morris on why Columbus Day should not be celebrated.\nThe Associated Press noted that more and more U.S. cities this year are recognizing Oct. 12 as Indigenous Peoples Day along with Columbus Day, thanks to a concerted push by Native American activists.\nIn Costa Rica, the legislature changed Oct. 12 from Día del Descubrimiento y de la Raza (Day of the Discovery [of the Americas] and Race) to Cultures Day in 1994. When the former was declared a national holiday , in 1968, the legislature said the holiday should commemorate “the spiritual community that links the nations of Latin America, the ties of a single religious faith [Catholic], the same historical and cultural traditions, common biological roots and identical aims of defending Christian civilization….” Ehem.\nThe 1994 law , on the other hand, says the day should “extol the pluricultural, multiethnic character of the people of Costa Rica.” (The nation’s constitution was changed in August to recognize that pluricultural, multiethnic character.) The law also says the day will commemorate the historic arrival in the Americas of Christopher Columbus. It goes on:\nThe indigenous, European, African and Asian values that make up the idiosyncrasy of Costa Rica will be exalted in the commemorative acts of Cultures Day. We will remember, on this day, the historical and cultural ties that bind the nations of Latin America. We will also stimulate the recovery of the aforementioned values.\nSeems like a good start.\nSuggested reading: Latino Rebels has published several interesting articles about Oct. 12 this year, including pro-Columbus Day and anti-Columbus Day op-eds, as well as an interview with Chilean hiphop star Ana Tijoux (along with clips of her excellent music).\nContact Jill Replogle at jillrep@ticotimes.net", "external_links": ["http://presidencia.go.cr/prensa/comunicados/costa-rica-se-declara-multietnica-y-pluricultura/", "http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/10/09/in-defense-of-columbus-day/", "http://www.dickshovel.com/colum.html", "http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/Busqueda/Normativa/Normas/nrm_texto_completo.aspx?param1=NRTC&nValor1=1&nValor2=36649&nValor3=38639&strTipM=TC", "http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/10/11/us/ap-us-columbus-day-name.html?_r=0", "http://www.pgrweb.go.cr/scij/Busqueda/Normativa/Normas/nrm_texto_completo.aspx?param1=NRTC&nValor1=1&nValor2=23107&nValor3=24474&strTipM=TC", "http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/10/11/ana-tijoux-conmemorando-la-resistencia-indigena/", "http://www.nea.org/tools/lessons/columbus-day-grades-k-5.htm", "http://www.latinorebels.com/2015/10/10/in-defiance-of-columbus-day/"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:17:18.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
