By adopting this mobile first mentality, the company has created a guest experience based on a clean, uncluttered interface that is easy to use and provides the information guests want.\nThe launch of the mobile website is the second phase in a three phase plan to redesign Best Western’s digital platform, which includes discarding the best website in the hotel industry (Compuware; Best of the Web Gold Award; 2012-2015) and building an entirely new bestwestern.com. As of August 2015, the brand launched new property websites for more than 2,000 properties across North America and in spring 2016, Best Western will unveil the new fully responsive bestwestern.com.\n“With our new mobile website and apps we have built simple, seamless online experiences designed to increase bookings, create guest loyalty and set expectations for an exceptional guest experience,” said Dorothy Dowling, senior vice president, marketing and sales. “With our mobile first mindset we are reinventing our guests’ mobile experience from top to bottom and providing a state of the art platform to connect with Best Western.”\nFeatures of the new Best Western mobile website and apps include:\n• Innovative hotel comparison view\n• Improved search function with ability to filter results based on rate, amenities, etc.\n• An engaging map-based feature which shows nearby attractions and points of interest\n• An enhanced visual design incorporating more images and rich media\n• Best Western Rewards® integration to encourage earning and redemption of points\n“With this next generation release of the Best Western mobile website and apps our goal is to increase engagement and help users complete the booking process. We have added features that users will find to be familiar, useful and incredibly easy to use in order to plan, research and book their travel using their favorite device,” said Greg Adams, vice president of business technology and eCommerce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:41:15.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
