The show highlights exciting new technologies in the automotive industry.\nEarlier this year, Cenntro launched production of the METRO™ , a purpose built All-Electric Compact Utility Vehicle (CUV) that is the most efficient in its class. It is the first electric utility vehicle to use a modular concept that can be fitted with various components to meet many different needs. The METRO™ CUV is street legal and designed with safety in mind. Manufactured in Cenntro's facility in Sparks, Nevada , it is the first vehicle in its class produced in the United States .\nCenntro has developed and integrated its powertrain, Cenntro Power™ for improved performance, weight balance and handling. The METRO™ can achieve a range of up to 50 miles, speed of up to 25 mph, an MPGe of 209, up to 6.2 M/Kwh, payload capacity of 1,400 pounds, and a payload ratio at 75% (payload over curb weight). The vehicle's efficient design puts less stress on the lead-acid battery, which extends battery life and travel distance.\nCenntro's proprietary design achieves high efficiency with low production costs, allowing it to be sold at the best price in its class. It is also designed to have minimal maintenance and a long life.\n\"The METRO is an extremely versatile vehicle. It can be configured for various applications such as maintenance, delivery, hauling, and transportation for many different industries including warehouse, agriculture, landscape, airports and urban operations,\" noted Peter Wang , CEO of Cenntro Automotive. \"The METRO offers our customers maximum flexibility in terms of range, design and purpose. Combined with the affordable price and low cost of ownership, it delivers a great value.\"\nThe METRO will initially be available in the EV model, a low speed variation. In late 2016, Cenntro's product line will expand to include Off Road, and a full speed variation will follow later.\nAbout Cenntro Automotive\nCenntro Automotive Corporation designs and manufactures 100% electric vehicles in the United States with additional operations in Europe and China.
