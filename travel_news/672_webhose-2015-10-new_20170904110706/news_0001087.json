Amazon India’s festival sale is a challenge to its arch rival Flipkart as the dates clash – sale will be available during the same period.\nThis is good news for buyers as festival shopping season is looming and everyone concerned has been eyeing the e-commerce industry for discounted ware.\nUnlike the Flipkart sale, which will be app-only, Amazon Great Indian Festive Sale deals will be available to consumers on on both website and app. The customers buying on the Amazon India app will have some exclusive offers like getting 15 minutes early access to top deals as well as additional 15% cash back on HDFC debit and credit cards.\nIt must be noted that to make the best of the sale, Amazon India and Flipkart, both have offered its customers tips to gear up for their festival sales by downloading the app in advance, signing for the account, newsletters and have payment and delivery address details saved on the account.\nLast year Flipkart was forced to apologised for the glitches encountered during its ‘Big Billion Day’ sale where it admitted its “failure” in living up to the expectations of its customers.\nHere are some of the top deals to be made available on Amazon:\n1. Microsoft Lumia 640 (Black, 8GB) for Rs 7, 999\n2. Sony Xperia Z1 (Black) for Rs. 15,999\n3. HTC Desire 620G (Milkyway Grey, 8GB) for just Rs 11, 819\nFirst Published on October 08, 2015 12:04 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:22:30.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
