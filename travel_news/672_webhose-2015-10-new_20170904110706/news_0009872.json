Ruth P. Peterkin / Fotolia Anna-Kay Tomlinson is known as Miss T to her many friends. Miss T's colourful dining room. Riding the chair lift up Mystic Mountain. Dunn's River Falls is a waterfall near Ocho Rios, Jamaica. Hundreds of vacationers come to Rick's Cafe at the end of each day to gather along the cliff edge and watch one of the world’s most beautiful sunsets. Florida's Babcock Ranch: Where alligators, panthers, black bears, deer, exotic birds and real-life cowboys roam \nJamaica to experience its wide variety of tastes and food textures. \nOr, you can pull into Miss T’s Kitchen in heart of this town on Jamaica’s north shore and experience the same thing. Anna-Kay Tomlinson – known as Miss T to her many friends – has already made that trip around her island to gather up the recipe for each unique meal she discovered. \nShe doesn’t apologize for borrowing the ideas, ingredients and recipes for the best meals on the island to serve in her Miss T’s Kitchen. Look at the time and money she is saving you. \nYou’ll eat in a garden setting at her rustic restaurant and bar where bright flowers compete for attention against the brightly-coloured paint on her wooden chairs and tables. \nMiss T’s Kitchen is popular with the locals as well as pasty-skinned refugees from a Canadian winter and that means her jerk chicken comes in a variety of finishes. If you are brave enough to go native and dig into a plate of hot, spicy jerk chicken or pork like the kitchen help do, well that’s certainly available. But if you would rather let your tummy acclimatize to the Jamaican taste, Miss T’s plates come in a variety of degrees, from wimpy to bold. \nOf course her native-plant salads and desserts are not only good for you, but substantial and delicious as well. You can wash it all down with a local beer or if you’re a bit homesick, she stocks Canadian beer too. \nOne way to build up a good appetite before sitting down in Miss T’s garden is to climb Mystic Mountain . This dense rainforest is only a few miles from her restaurant and if you don’t feel like hacking your way through the jungle you can ride to the top of the mountain on a comfortable chairlift while marveling at the magnificent blue/green Caribbean 700 feet below. \nAt the top of Mystic Mountain you can become a member of the famous Jamaica Bobsled Team that made such an impression at the Calgary Olympics in 1988. This exhilarating ride, twisting and turning at high speeds through the jungle on a bobsled rail, is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Caribbean . \nAlthough you’re rushing downhill, a conveyor chain brings you back where you started and lets you catch your breath from screaming, wipe slobber off your chin, and adjust your clothes for a dignified exit back at the top. \nBefore boarding the bobsled, check out the outdoor sports museum at the top of Mystic Mountain that profiles Jamaica’s many world-class athletes, many of whom reside in Canada. You’ll also be buzzed often by vervain hummingbirds, the second smallest bird in the world. They drink from nectar dispensers and exotic flowers. \nDunn’s River Falls , the iconic Jamaican waterfall that you can walk up, is also near Miss T’s Kitchen in Ocho Rios . You don’t have to challenge the falls to enjoy the river. It creates a natural pool of soothing warm water before flowing into the ocean. \nBut if it’s excitement you seek, drive 90 minutes north of Ocho Rios to Negril on the westernmost tip of mainland Jamaica and see if you can find room to sit at Rick’s Cafe . \nIt’s a popular spot. Rick’s Cafe claims to be one of the 190 best bars in the world. \nIt is certainly one of the most persistent bars in the world. Twice, proprietor Richard Hershman has had to rebuild his bar from scratch after two visitors trashed it – a decade and a half apart. \nGilbert came crashing through Rick’s front door on September 12, 1988. Almost 16 years to the day – September 11, 2004 – Ivan came calling. They’re both hurricanes. \nIt’s hard to imagine that a bar sitting atop a 10-metre-high cliff overlooking the Caribbean could be wiped out by waves. But on both occasions, it was huge waves, not wind, that obliterated the concrete cafe. Ivan’s 25- metre-high waves easily rolled over the cliffs. \nThose cliffs help make Rick’s Cafe a contender for any list on the best bars in the world. Hundreds of vacationers come to the cafe at the end of each day to gather along the cliff edge and watch one of the world’s most beautiful sunsets. \nThey drink, they eat and some even jump off the cliffs into the blue Caribbean waters. \nProfessional cliff divers climb to the top of a 10-metre-high tree at the edge of the cliff that has survived both Gilbert and Ivan, and entertain the spectators with ballet-like acrobatics before plunging to the sea. \nRick’s Cafe is only a few kilometres from Grand Lido Negril , one of nearly 40 beach resorts along Jamaica’s north shore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:36:29.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
