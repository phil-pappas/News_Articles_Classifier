The forum will focus on the achievements, challenges, and opportunities that exist. Expected attendees include the private sector and government representatives in regards to the tourism sector. \nThe celebrations will be crowned with a Grand Dinner at the end of the year at Speke Resort Munyonyo, with expected guests from airlines, hotels, lodges, and other “A-listed” corporates including counterparts within the region. \nAs a memento of the anniversary, a souvenir magazine for AUTO@20 will be launched, highlighting achievements and challenges, social events, pictorials, and features from the telex age to the dot com age. \nIn line with this year’s theme of professionalizing the industry, AUTO recently embarked on developing a Strategic Plan through a United Nations Development Program/Uganda Tourism Board (UNDP/UTB) funded program. However, before the celebrations can even start, the association has to juggle issues at the macro level including convincing technocrats at the Ministry of Finance and Uganda Revenue Authority that tourism is indeed an invisible export and, therefore, qualifies for a zero rating on (Value Added Tax) VAT, contesting the Immigration Department’s hike in visa fees from US$50 to US$100, as well as representing the sector interests on commitments to the East African Community Common market and yet still try to stay afloat. \nThrough the Presidential Initiative for Sustainable Tourism in Uganda (PRESTO), the association has set up a team to lobby for a reprieve in high fees and taxes, which has forced several operators to downsize or go bust altogether. \nThe association recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with t he Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) which will boost the association’s coffers more than tenfold from a paltry US$10,000 ten years ago. \nFrom humble beginnings with no secretariat, the AUTO badge is recognized as the major reference for the government of Uganda as well as travelers intending to book a safari to Uganda, and tourism has now taken its rightful place as one of the key sectors of the economy on the Presidential Round Table Forum. \nCoincidentally, the Uganda Tourism Board also turns twenty this year, but any hopes of confetti, champagne, or braai on the spit to celebrate the anniversary of the first Tourism Board in the region are fast fading with only a couple of months left to the end of the year.
