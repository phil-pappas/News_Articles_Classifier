Air Esscentials will also be providing luxury candles with the same custom fragrance to attendees.\nResearch has shown that dispersing a pleasant scent has a powerful effect in retail settings: increasing sales, encouraging customers to stay longer, improving customer evaluations of the brand and increasing their intentions to return to the store again. Luxury retailers and hotels such as Hugo Boss, Jimmy Choo, and the Ritz Carlton have been using scent marketing for years.\n“For years JCK has understood that the environment that we shop in can make a big difference in purchasing and perception. JCK has teamed up with the scent marketing and branding specialists at Air Esscentials to enhance the environment of the LUXURY Ballrooms in order to create a luxurious buying experience,” says Sarin Bachmann, the Event Director of JCK.\n“We have scented a number of luxury retailers including jewelry stores with very positive results,” adds Spence Levy, President of Air Esscentials. “Now, luxury jewelry designers and stores will be able to enjoy a shopping experience enhanced with scent and can experience first hand how scent marketing can help them sell more.”\nSource:- Air Esscentials", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:05:18.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
