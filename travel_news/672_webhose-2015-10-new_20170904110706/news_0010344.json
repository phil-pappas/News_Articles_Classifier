How Can Women Have the Vegas Experience? \nLas Vegas has a reputation for being a place full of gambling dens and strip joints, and most certainly not the place any self-respecting single female would want to travel to alone. But why not? \nThere is more to Vegas than girls and money \nThe hidden truth about Las Vegas is that there is so much more to the place than sex and gambling. This city in the desert actually has something for everyone, and is just as perfect for the person who wants to go to bed at a sensible hour as the person who wants to forget what bed is and stay up all night. \nIf you have a tight budget, opt for accommodation off the Strip or Downtown, and take advantage of coupons that are available, simply by signing up to Vegas hotel websites. It is also easy to get to the main areas, thanks to some hotels offering free shuttle services. Blue Green Resorts is a company that caters for vacations in Las Vegas, and offers a range of accommodation packages with all the amenities of home, right on the doorsteps of some of Vegas’ biggest names. \nWomen love to gamble too, and the main reason for going to Vegas is to hit the casinos. Just remember that you are unlikely to have big wins, and only gamble with money you can afford to lose. There are plenty of casinos on the Strip, but for glitz and glamour head to the Cosmopolitan, the favorite hangout of the rich and famous. Never play in a game where your opponents are locals; playing the casinos is their business and it is certain you will lose, and lose big. Play only with other tourists to have a chance of making a win. \nOf course, safety is key when women are travelling solo or in a small party. The best way to stay safe is act sensibly. Always stick to the tourist areas that are well-lit, keep valuables close to your person or locked in your hotel room, and do not dress in a way that is sure to attract the attention of undesirables. Finally, keep your wits about you by not drinking to excess. \nVegas can be a great place for a woman to visit alone, not just offering gambling, but a whole range of other activities, including museum attractions and stunning shows, as well as that all-important boutique shopping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:22:34.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
