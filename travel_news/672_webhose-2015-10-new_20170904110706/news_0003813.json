Norwegian Escape will be the largest ship to homeport year-round in Miami and features a multitude of innovative dining venues and entertainment offerings.\nIt is a longstanding tradition in the maritime world to name a Godparent of a new sea-going vessel. This honour, dating back to the 1800s, is bestowed upon an individual who officially names and christens a new ship, and remains in their role for the life of the vessel. Pitbull will serve as the honorary Godfather for Norwegian Escape, becoming one of the naming ceremony’s central figures along with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.’s CEO Frank Del Rio and Norwegian President Andy Stuart. This exciting event will take place while the ship is docked in PortMiami on Monday, November 9, where Pitbull will officially christen the ship during a high-energy pier side ceremony. The selection of Pitbull as the ship’s Godfather reinforces Norwegian’s non-traditional cruising that focuses on freedom and flexibility for guests.\n“Pitbull has been an excellent partner and great friend to Norwegian Cruise Line,” said Andy Stuart, Norwegian Cruise Line’s President. “A Miami native, he epitomizes and contributes to the energy, excitement and local flavour that our ships so proudly embody and we’re excited to build upon our relationship and have him serve in this special role as Godfather to Norwegian Escape.”\nThis new role builds on the superstar’s previous relationship with Norwegian, as the international recording artist thrilled the crowd during the February 2014 christening ceremony for Norwegian Getaway, which also featured the introduction of his signature Voli vodka brand to cruise goers. Voli is available across the Norwegian fleet and featured in several signature cocktails including the Mr. Worldwide and Dale.\nTo learn more about Norwegian Escape’s world-class dining and beverage offerings, Broadway entertainment and luxurious suites, as well as to view video and photo renderings of the vessel and her beautiful amenities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:27:35.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
