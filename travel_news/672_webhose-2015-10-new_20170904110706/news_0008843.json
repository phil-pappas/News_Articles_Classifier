Fortunately, cruise lines are increasingly offering specialty dining options that bring a new standard of excellence to the seas. Though not included covered by the all-inclusive rate, these restaurants offer high-end, intimate dining experiences at reasonable prices. In addition, more and more ships now feature menus that have been created by celebrity chefs and include luxury ingredients like caviar and truffles. For your next cruise, consider skipping the banquet hall and making a reservation (at a time of your choosing!) at one of these outstanding cruise-ship restaurants. \nBy Zachary Laks Sign in to leave a comment Browse More Topics Use of this site indicates your consent to the Terms of Use.
