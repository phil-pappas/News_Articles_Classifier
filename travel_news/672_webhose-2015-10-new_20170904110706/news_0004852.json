What spouses Jimmie and Marti Schein sell are history and memories, guides to where we came from and, perhaps, where we’re going.\nThe burnished floor-to-ceiling shelves are crammed with oversize atlases that can be plucked from on high only by way of ladders set on tracks and rollers.\nThere is an air of orderly chaos: maps and vintage photos in protective sleeves in produce crates, rolled into tubes or placed in thin-drawered desks with hand-scrawled cards denoting regions and periods.\nEven in this era when digital trumps analog in all things, people apparently remain interested in poring over the physical and tactile details of streets and landmarks, either still around or long since plowed under. The mutability of borderlines, whether of cities, states or countries, tells a story that travels far beyond pixels on a screen.\n“Without getting too existential,” said Mr. Schein, who then proceeded to wax existential, “maps are hard-wired into who and what we are. We are maps. We differentiate ourselves through language. What were the first things we discussed? Where we were. Where was danger. How we got there. How we got here. This is mapping. This is, in technical terms, the use of the hippocampus, the part of the brain that, in fact, is spatial memory and memory that allows us to recall both through the directional as well as the olfactory. All these tangential associations support mapping.”\nMr. Schein does not despair about the future of maps.\n“The youthful population is looking for the unique and the individualized in a mass-produced world of the trite and the digital,” he said. “They use maps more than you and I ever did — on their phone. But that’s ephemeral and not worthy of the paper you’d print it on. But I do find they’re interested in conceptual mapping, geo-spatial mapping, or statistical overlays, like where the sewer lines run, or three-dimensional paradigms. Maps won’t go away. They’ll just change.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:13:54.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
