PUBLISHED: 18:17, Mon, Oct 12, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:49, Mon, Oct 12, 2015 NC Wild Swimming Sydney reveals top spots for tourists to take a dip \nMacCallum Pool \nWhat an enviable harbourside position: on a Monopoly board MacCallum would be one of the dark blue properties. Tucked below the Morton Bay fig-lined slopes of Cremorne Reserve, it has superb views across the harbour to the Royal Botanical Gardens and Opera House. You may want to mirror the famous arc of the Harbour Bridge with your freestyle arm as it looms in the distance. Although penguins aren’t allowed into the enclosure they’re apt to do laps in the water just beyond the pool’s edge. \nOccupying such prime real estate hasn’t affected any of the egalitarian ethos that accompanies Australian rock pools, MacCallum really feels like it exists for everyone.

This is a special place you should swim in at least once. The 30m pool is flanked by a wooden boardwalk, which is raised up from the water so as you swim you can spy harbour life unfold before you. \nPalm Beach & Rock Pool “Palmy” to the locals, this is home of the fictitious Summer Bay (from Home & Away) and it is easy to see why, it feels like it is on a perpetual summer holiday. On the surface of it is just another beautiful Sydney beach backed by Norfolk Pines and multimillion dollar homes. Yet Palmy has its own special kind of allure. For one, it is the end of the road and there is definitely something to be said for being the last stop. Although this can mean it becomes clogged with traffic on summer days it also gives it a laid-back vibe. \nIt is a those-in-the-know kind of place and consequently doesn’t get the crowds of the beach. The water has an abundance of tiny fish that swim between the luscious, waving featherboa like stems of golden seaweed, so bring your goggles. The beach is a 2km hook of rose-tinted sand. NC On a Monopoly board MacCallum would be one of the dark blue properties \nBarrenjoey \nHeadland sits at its northern end, a great leafy dome crowned by the iconic lighthouse. The southern end also has a rock pool. Although the 50m pool is concrete, painted and pumped, its picturesque, northfacing location and far-reaching views make it lovely nonetheless. Wattamolla \nThis place always seems to turn it on. Not only is it beautiful but this wild swimmer’s paradise is large and varied enough to satisfy everyone. Not surprisingly with so much to offer it is the most popular destination in Royal National Park. The lagoon is fed by two creeks, one of which tumbles off a cliff providing jumping opportunities for the adventurous. There are a few heights, up to 10m, and while officially prohibited, revellers can always be found hurling themselves off its edge with whoops of delight. NC Wattamolla is a wild swimmer’s paradise \nWentworth Falls \nIf you need to clear out the cobwebs a swim beneath these awe-inspiring falls will definitely do the trick. As the falls loom from 187m above, you are immersed in cold water amid a near-deafening rumble; the thrill of it all will leave room for nothing else. The walk down to the bottom of the falls has stupendous views over Jamison Valley, with the cliff-side track providing one of the most spectacular vantage points in the Blue Mountains. Part of it was made over a hundred years ago by the “Irish Brigade”, a dedicated but clearly crazy lot who cut steps into the sheer sandstone cliffs to enable safe access into the valley. It is difficult to imagine a steeper walk, the last section involves a series of near-vertical caged ladders but your efforts are rewarded. Swimming allows you to get right up close to the falls, the water billows out, illuminated by the sun, before dropping into the pool hard and fast. \nSometimes it feels like a wondrous massage, at other times its sharp points drill into your skin and burn; yet the ebullient experience will leave you wide-eyed and buzzing.

Known as “Ganguddy” to the local Wiradjuri people, the name Dunns Swamp is a bit misleading as it is actually a dammed section of the Cudgegong River, with deep, dark brown water that feels silky on the skin. Dunns was created in the 1920s to provide water for Kandos cement works, yet despite its industrial beginnings the landscape is striking and it is a smashing place for a swim. One thing you notice is that it is startlingly quiet, with just a sprinkling of chirruping birds filtering through the thick silence. The river adjoins a large busy campground but you shouldn’t have trouble finding a place to yourself if you are seeking solitude. Although jumping and diving are prohibited throughout Wollemi National Park, it hasn’t gone unnoticed that the rock ledges jutting out over very deep water are seemingly made for it, one spot facing Platypus Point is particularly popular. \n* Wild Swimming Sydney, (Wild Things Publishing) by Sally Tertini and Steve Pollard, £16.99.
