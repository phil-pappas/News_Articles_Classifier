They have had half the house and the wall rebuilt. \n“You have got the articulated lorries and that road is not wide enough – everybody thinks it.” \nAnother agreed and said: “It’s long and straight and it’s always been a concern to people who live on the road. \n“The traffic is getting heavier everywhere but there are certainly more commercial vehicles and we have had accidents at the crossroads. \n“There should be speed cameras or some sort of traffic calming measures.” Share article \nPolice are continuing to investigate the incident and are asking anyone with information to come forward. \nA Hampshire Constabulary spokeswoman said: “Anyone who witnessed this incident is asked to contact Sergeant Wayne Voller of the South East Hampshire Roads Policing Unit on 101 quoting Operation Silkworm.” Promoted Stories Young boy suffers life threatening injuries after crash in Swanmore Sorry, an error occurred.
