Now Waze , the popular navigation app, has data to name them. \nEvaluating sessions from its millions of users around the USA and world, Waze compared traffic, road quality/infrastructure, driver safety, driver services, socio-economic factors and what they call “Wazeyness,” which ranks the level of helpfulness and happiness among Waze users. \nBefore you scoff at the latter, Waze spokesperson Julie Mossler says it’s a key to the rankings. “Waze users take the time to self-report their moods as well as quantitative factors such as accidents, potholes and more. Input from 50 million everyday commuters tells quite a compelling story.” \nAccording to the data crunchers, the number one city in the U.S. for driving is … a tie, between Greensboro, N.C. and Phoenix, which also scored number one in the world. See the complete rankings in the slideshow above, plus Waze’s rankings for the 10 worst (“least satisfied”) driving cities in America. \nU.S. cities also took five of the top ten spots worldwide. Amsterdam and Rouen, France, were the highest ranking foreign cities. And for Americans who gripe about our roads and traffic, Waze’s list of the world’s most miserable driving cities reveals Colombia and Indonesia have it much worse. \nWorld’s worst driving cities \nSan Salvador, El Salvador (2.1 out of 10 on Waze’s satisfaction scale)Cali, Colombia (2.6)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:43:10.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
