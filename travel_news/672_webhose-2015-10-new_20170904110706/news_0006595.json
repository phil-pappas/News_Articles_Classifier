Anyone following the headlines might think that falling prices are a bad thing. Inflation is coming down and in some parts of the world deflation is making an appearance. Why is this and what’s not to like? There is never one answer as to why, but falling commodity prices are a factor. On the supply side we are getting better at finding, extracting and growing the things that we need. This is a long-term trend driven by innovation and is unlikely to reverse. On the other side of the equation, demand is down at the moment. A slowdown in the growth rate in China is a good short-term reason, but the longer-term trend is that we are using raw materials more efficiently than we used to. Think about all the kit that the smartphone in your pocket has replaced. Consumers have noticed that life’s essentials such as food and petrol are getting cheaper and, unaffected by economic theory, are pleasantly surprised. On top of this UK average earnings have increased by 3pc over the last year and mortgage interest rates are flat on the floor. A powerful aphrodisiac for spending on small luxuries and perhaps why those who run restaurants and cinemas are smiling. Not everyone’s happy Central bankers, in contrast don’t like it. In the UK they have set an inflation target of 2pc and are disconcerted that despite their best efforts, the real world is refusing to respond. The accepted wisdom in these circles is that deflation will delay consumer spending in expectation of further price falls. This might have happened in the past, but many other factors now influence consumers. Perhaps a psychologist rather than an economist might be better placed to make predictions. Cheap no longer means nasty and the young don’t like paying for anything. Perhaps our policy makers are misreading the pulse of the economy Those in charge of economic policy seem scarred by the past, whether the inflationary binge of the 1970s or the 1930s. High long-term unemployment is a huge waste of people’s lives, but new jobs are being created. Internationally the UK is regarded as a modern, high-value open economy with a free-floating currency where manufacturing and service industries are thriving, government policy is coherent, we have a competent central bank and the legal system is fair. Manufacturing may be a smaller part of the UK economy than in the past but those who make things are highly professional. Car component suppliers are well used to handling contracts where a 5pc per annum price cut is mandatory. Cheap doesn’t mean nasty This means that lower prices are being baked into the supply chain with the eventual buyers, us, benefiting. Food prices are falling because we are getting better at producing what we want. Higher crop yields from less land using less fertiliser and cheaper transportation are all having an effect. Oil prices are down because supply is exceeding demand. Innovation is reducing the costs of extraction to the extent that previously uneconomic fields are ripe for development. Service providers know that consumers have come to expect low prices and better quality. Cheap no longer means nasty and the young don’t like paying for anything. Perhaps our policy makers are misreading the pulse of the economy. The current period of low inflation or even deflation isn’t a disease that needs to be cured if it is driven by innovation and invention. Don’t relax just yet What could disturb this happy situation? Well in the last few years we have seen that it takes serious amount of incompetence to create inflation. Zimbabwe and Venezuela found the answer, but that’s about it. Wage inflation without reason used to be a cause of inflation, but no longer because consumers just won’t pay up. If companies are prepared to make lower profits then that’s their business. It is back to commodities as the most likely catalyst for higher prices. The favourable supply/demand balance at the moment could reverse for reasons way beyond the powers of governments and central banks to control. The Middle East pressure cooker might blow or maybe it will be the weather. This is an El Niño year in the Pacific. A drought in the US mid-west or a late monsoon in India could drive food prices higher. So a plea to those who set monetary policy: please don’t torture the financial system to hit your self-imposed target. In the real world good companies have got used to \"everyday low prices\" and are doing fine. Let consumers enjoy it while they can.
