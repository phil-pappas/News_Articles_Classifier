And this century, chef Lionel Levy caused uproar when he served it as a milkshake at his restaurant Une Table au Sud, on Marseille’s Vieux Port. Sylvain Robert of nearby L’Aromat later created a scandalous bouillabaisse burger, with fishcake, saffron mayonnaise and Provençal herb relish.\nRelated: Marseille city guide: what to see plus the best bars, restaurants and hotels\nFew dishes epitomise Provence as well as this fish stew, traditionally served with rouille (spicy mayonnaise) on thickly sliced bread. It probably originated as a way for the fisherfolk of Marseille to use up fish that was too bony to sell. By the 20th century it had become a regional speciality, described as soupe d’or (soup of gold) by gastronomy writer Curnonsky. It is usually made for at least 10 people, although every other year on the last Sunday of June (the next one is 25 June 2016), the fishermen of Sanary-sur-Mer near Toulon cook a bouillabaisse big enough for 2,500 people, to mark the feast of their patron saint, Saint Peter.\nIn 1980 a group of restaurateurs in Marseille tried to standardise the dish by drawing up the Bouillabaisse Charter. It states, among other things, that the stew must include at least four items from a specified list of fish and seafood.\nBouillabaisse rarely comes better than at Nounou, in Golfe-Juan between Cannes and Antibes. The broth is served first, with the fish and saffron potatoes on a separate platter, with rouille and saffron bread.\n• Sylvia Kontek is co-founder of Bandol , a Niçoise and Provencal restaurant opening in Chelsea, west London, on 13 October", "external_links": ["http://barbandol.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-11T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:48:23.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
