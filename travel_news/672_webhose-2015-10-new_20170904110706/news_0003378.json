Reverse Happy Hour features five new cocktails created by Mote named the Four Seasons Tropical Collection after the five locales they were inspired by – Seychelles, Bora Bora, Maui, Mexico City and Costa Rica.\nWorking with the cocktails’ flavour profiles, Chef Bell has created five tasting dishes perfect for pairing, such as crispy fried selva shrimp and black tea crusted albacore tuna. Mote’s Tropical Collection stays true to what YEW guests have come to expect from the luxury brand, offering innovative, thoughtful cocktails featuring top-shelf liquor and premium ingredients at an approachable price.\nReverse Happy Hour is available in YEW bar + lounge seven days a week from 8:00 to 11:00 pm, which is the only time guests will be able to enjoy the new menu. Cocktails and tasting plates start at CAD 16.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:50:25.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
