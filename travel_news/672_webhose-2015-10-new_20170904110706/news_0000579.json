Alongside this panel discussion was the premiere screening of Visit California’s latest California Dreamers video “Dream of Dance,” which explores Heffington’s creative world and Golden State inspiration.\nAt the GRAMMY Museum in Downtown Los Angeles, Caroline Beteta, President and CEO of Visit California, led a conversation with “Anna” talent and crew. Emma Stone discussed her music video debut, while Heffington noted how his work has been inspired by California icons such as the Queen Mary in Long Beach, a key centerpiece in the video.\n“Dream of Dance” explores Heffington’s California roots and creative process, along with behind-the-scenes footage from “Anna.” His work includes the acclaimed Sia video “Chandelier,” with nearly one billion views on YouTube, and collaborations with Arcade Fire and Sigor Ros. The video is available online today on Visit California’s Dream365TV network, a digital content channel dedicated to California and the promise of dreaming big.\n“Ryan is from a small town in northern California, and his passion for his craft and for California is unparalleled,” Beteta said. “His rise to success and his hugely popular collaborations tell a perfect story of what it means to be a California Dreamer.”\nSource:- Visit California", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:21:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
