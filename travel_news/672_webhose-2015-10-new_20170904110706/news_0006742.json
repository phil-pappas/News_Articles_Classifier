(Video by Fox35) Dewayne Bevil Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel Name change is official, but there's still work to be done at Disney Springs \nThe name has changed, but there's still construction — and tenant announcements — in the future for Disney Springs, the entertainment complex formerly known as Downtown Disney, a company official says. \nTuesday's official name change is \"a huge milestone for us,\" said Keith Bradford, vice president of Disney Springs. \"There's plenty more to come.\" \nA celebration marked the occasion Tuesday afternoon at Waterview Park, a space adjacent to Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar, the latest addition to the Disney Springs lineup. \nThe ceremony featured speeches, followed by cast members holding cards that flipped from the Downtown Disney logo to the Disney Springs version. Walt Disney World President George A. Kalogridis thanked the project's partners and members of the Central Florida business community. \nNext will be Morimoto Asia, a restaurant that opens to the public Wednesday. \nThe Disney Springs renovation, announced in 2013, includes an increase in dining, shopping and entertainment options plus a number of infrastructure improvements, including two parking garages and a new link with Interstate 4. \nPhotos of construction and signage of Disney Springs, the new incarnation of Downtown Disney planned for completion in 2016. More coverage here . \n\"The I-4 connector will open up in October,\" Bradford said. \"That will ease a lot of pressure off of Buena Vista Drive and more direct access to the property.\" One option on that ramp will include the ability to drive straight into the Disney Springs parking garage. \nConstruction on the Town Center sector, much of which is rising in a former parking lot, continues. \n\"Town Center and the second garage are all slated for the summer of 2016,\" Bradford said. \nAnnounced retailers coming to Disney Springs include Lilly Pulitzer, Uniqlo, Edward Beiner eyewear, Pandora, Tommy Bahama and Zara. Also on tap is the NBA Experience, an interactive center that will include a restaurant and retail operations where DisneyQuest is located.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:48:50.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
