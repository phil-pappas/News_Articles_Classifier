Â© 2009 Betsy Malloy Photography. Used by Permission. \nCalistoga, California, sits in the end of the Napa Valley like a cork in a wine bottle. Few Napa visitors drive far enough past the northernmost \"Welcome to Napa\" sign to find this small place, its early 1900s main street only a few blocks long. \nOne of California history's greatest characters gave Calistoga its name, or so the story goes. Sam Brannan, who once owned most of the town, was asked what he planned to do with his northern Napa property. He intended to make it the Saratoga Springs of California, but with his diction slurred by alcohol Brannan replied, \"I'm going to make it the Calistoga of Sarafornia!\" \nCalistoga's small town ambiance, coupled with sophisticated dining and shopping, make it a favorite of many wine country visitors. Underground thermal features give rise to natural hot spring spas here. Grapevines and vineyards sprout in the surrounding countryside, and it's all so compact that you can get around easily.
