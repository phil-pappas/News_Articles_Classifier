FILE PHOTO The Astronomer by Dutch master Johannes Vermeer is on loan to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Vermeer art in Boston \nThe Boston Museum of Fine Arts has opened a new exhibit that looks at the social structure of the Netherlands in the 1600s through art. \nIt includes two Johannes Vermeer works — The Astronomer , on loan from the Louvre; and A Lady Writing , on loan from the National Gallery of Art in Washington — on display at the museum simultaneously for the first time. \nThe exhibition, which runs through Jan. 18, reflects the ways in which paintings represent the socioeconomic groups of the era — from the Princes of Orange to the indigent — through 75 portraits, genre scenes, landscapes and seascapes borrowed from European and American public and private collections. Space mission is focus \nSix space pioneers will share their experiences during a free presentation at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force near Dayton. \nThe presentation is titled “The Dorian Files Revealed: The Manned Orbiting Laboratory Crew Members’ Secret Mission in Space.” \nThe mission of the 1960s-era project, which was never completed, was to place a manned spy satellite into orbit around the Earth. \nCall 937-255-3286 or visit www.nationalmuseum.af.mil Artifacts can be ID’d \nYou can find out more about your odd rock or old man-made artifact at Artifact Identification Day from 9 a.m. to noon Saturday at the Wayne National Forest Welcome Center on U.S. 33 near Nelsonville. \nA team of professional archaeologists and paleontologists from Hopewell Culture National Historical Park and Ohio University will help identify items for free. \nVisit www.fs.usda.gov/wayne Early holiday event set \nThe Christmas season will kick off in Tipp City on Nov. 14-15 with the town’s Winter’s Yuletide Gathering celebration. \nThe evening will include open houses in the historic downtown, pictures with Santa, holiday meals and horse-drawn carriage rides.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:36:05.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
