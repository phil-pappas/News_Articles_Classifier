PUBLISHED: 10:51, Thu, Oct 22, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:08, Thu, Oct 22, 2015 CATERS Malaysian fishermen have been pictured catching mantis shrimp \nA photographer has shared a set of incredible images with the world, giving us an insight into the lives of Malaysian sea gypsies. \nUnderwater production company Scubazoo travelled to the village to learn more about this unusual way of fishing as part of their 'Borneo from Below' online series.

CATERS The mantis shrimp is one of the most feared crustaceans because of its strength \n\"Mantis shrimp is a popular dish in the region and the shrimps have been caught using traditional fishing methods for a long time, which are incredibly targeted and non-destructive compared to other local practices such as fish bombing or cyanide.\" \nThe traditional fishermen use a simple but ingenious method to capture one of the most violent underwater creatures in the world: mantis shrimps. \nThe shrimps have arm spears or clubs that can accelerate with the same velocity as a gunshot - and at its peak, the force is over 2,500 times the animal's body weight. \nTo earn a living, the people in the fishing village of Semporna, on the eastern coast of Malaysian Borneo, use four tools - fishing line, bamboo, rock and bait - to capture the volatile shrimps. CATERS The mantis shrimp is literally stunning with its bright colours \nThe technicolour crustaceans have even been known to smash through aquarium glass and diver's goggles. \nDespite their violent ways, they are commonly served in restaurants throughout Asia - often prepared as sushi or deep fried and served with chilli and garlic. \nOnce they're caught, in the sea, the stunning animals are wedged into bottles to be transported to an aquarium. \nEarnings for the sea gypsies are slim, with each shrimp selling to restaurants for the equivalent of 50 pence. On a very good day, 10-20 can be caught. \nThe unusual method uses a fishing line which is turned into a noose and fastened to a piece of bamboo, which has bait skewered onto it, like a kebab. \nThe construction is then put in the mantis's burrow, so that the bait tempts the mantis towards the opening. \nThe other end of the fishing line is attached to a heavy object, such as a rock, so that when the mantis takes the bait the fishing line tightens around it. The more it struggles, the tighter the hold. \nThen a tug of war breaks out as the fisherman pulls the mantis out of its burrow. \nTo check out more of Borneo's underwater life, visit Borneo from Below: www.borneofrombelow.com Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:23:33.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
