The code-share agreement will lead to excellent new connections between Denmark and a large number of business and leisure destinations around the world including Bali, Singapore, Mumbai, Goa, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Hanoi, Shanghai, Hyderabad and Dhaka. \nQatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr Akbar Al Baker, said: “SUN-AIR’s company values are closely aligned with those of Qatar Airways and we therefore see excellent opportunities with this new code-share agreement, maintaining and enhancing our competitive offer to customers. Qatar Airways is expanding rapidly across the world and the agreement with SUN-AIR further strengthens our position, whilst providing our passengers with an unrivalled global network.” \nSUN-AIR’s Commercial Director, Kristian Tvergaard, said: ”We are honoured to be able to add the Qatar Airways code on our flights and in this way offer unique connections for our customers between our three bases in Jutland - Billund, Aarhus and Aalborg - and the Qatar Airways hub in Doha. I am convinced our customers will appreciate the global network offer beyond Doha and not least the excellent inflight service offered by Qatar Airways which is very similar to SUN-AIR’s.” \nSUN-AIR's motto is “Not bigger – but better” and it primarily targets the business traveller segment. The work efficiency and flexibility offered by its 200 employees ensures that passengers receive the highest possible level of quality, service and safety. \nQatar Airways has seen rapid growth in just 18 years of operation and today flies a modern fleet of 166 aircraft to 152 key business and leisure destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and South America. At this year’s Skytrax Awards, the airline won Airline of the Year, Best Business Class Airline Seat and Best Airline in the Middle East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:54:06.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
