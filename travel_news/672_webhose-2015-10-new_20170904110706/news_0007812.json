Could I work here? What if I started a new life here? —creep in. Most of the time these musings are wishful thinking and nothing more. For Eric Werner and Mya Henry, however, the idea of uprooting to a faraway place quickly became very real. On a vacation to Tulum, Mexico, in 2009, the husband-and-wife team decided with firm conviction that the next time they returned it would be for good. In 2010 the chefs, at the time both working in restaurants in New York City, came back and signed the paperwork that sealed the deal: They would open a restaurant called Hartwood on a 3,000-square-foot plot in the beachside jungle of Tulum.\nNow, after years of amassing culinary praise from highly respected food critics and chefs like Alice Waters and René Redzepi, Werner and Henry are releasing a book today, Hartwood: Bright, Wild Recipes From the Edge of the Yucatán , that tells their story and reveals some of their most unique recipes and techniques. Using only local fare from the fisherman and farmers whom they’ve grown close with in the area, Werner and Henry create loosely Mexican-inspired dishes—though you won’t find chips and guacamole here. What you will find is beautifully plated menu items like a signature jicama salad, papaya empanadas, fresh catches of the day like mahimahi or Caribbean lobster, and pork ribs marinated in agave. They utilize traditional herbs like epazote and avocado leaf, and make their own roasted oils from garlic, chile, and onion.\nLike the more simple life these chefs chose to live in Tulum, the idea of the food at Hartwood is about slowing down, appreciating the layers of taste, and understanding the origins of the ingredients in each dish. As Redzepi writes in the book’s forward, “It makes me happy and a bit jealous when I think about the fact that they did all this by leaving the big city behind and finding their own path.” Doing what you love in the middle of paradise? Anyone would be envious.\nFor those who can’t take off and head to the beach, here are two recipes straight from Hartwood’s new book to give you a taste of Tulum—and maybe make you feel a little inspired, too.\nLentil and Papaya Salad With Lime and Honey Vinaigrette\nServes 6\nThis salad plays the fresh flavors of papaya and grapefruit against the earthiness of the lentils. It’s bright and fruity, but it’s also substantial. The chunks of papaya and grapefruit in the salad are echoed by a papaya-and-grapefruit sauce you make in the blender (you’ll have extra—drink it straight while you cook), and the whole dish comes together with a lime and honey vinaigrette you’ll want to use for pretty much every other salad you make. Amaranth greens are increasingly easy to find at farmers’ markets in the summer.\nWe use both amaranth seeds and the leaves in this recipe. Many people talk about nose-to-tail cooking; we do that not only with fish but with vegetables, plants, and herbs. Using the entire ingredient is a must whenever you get the chance.\nIngredients:\n1 cup dried lentils (French, brown, or red)\n2 cups water\nKosher salt\n1 white onion, halved\n1 carrot, peeled and halved\n3 bay leaves\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 cup Lime and Honey Vinaigrette (recipe follows), or as needed\n1/2 bunch amaranth, leaves only (or kale or chard, torn into 1-inch pieces)\n2 grapefruit, suprêmed (see Note)\n1 summer squash, thinly sliced\n1/2 papaya, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces\n1/2 lime (optional)\n1 cup Papaya Grapefruit Sauce (recipe follows)\nPuffed amaranth seeds for garnish (optional)\nInstructions:\n1. Cook the lentils. Combine the lentils, water, 2 teaspoons salt, the onion, carrot, and bay leaves in a large saucepan. Bring to a rolling boil over medium heat and cook for 15 minutes. Check to see if the lentils are tender; depending on the type of lentils, it may take up to another 15 minutes to cook them. Remove from the heat, drain, and cool, then discard the onion, carrot, and bay leaves and season lentils with salt and pepper.\n2. Put the lentils in a medium bowl and toss with the vinaigrette. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Add the amaranth leaves and toss. Add the grapefruit suprêmes, squash, and papaya and toss gently—the fruit will break apart some, but you don’t want the pieces to turn to mush. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more vinaigrette if necessary. (Sometimes an extra squeeze of lime is nice, too.)\n3. To serve, dab the papaya grapefruit sauce onto six salad plates (or onto a serving platter) and use the back of a spoon to spread it into a swirl. Gently arrange the lentil salad on top and sprinkle with puffed amaranth seeds, if using.\nLime and Honey Vinaigrette\nMakes about 1 cup\nThere are so many limes in Mexico. It’s an ingredient that you use for everything: drinks, soups, meat, desserts. So this vinaigrette has lots of applications. You can use it as a marinade, as a way to get proteins started before you put them on the grill or in the oven, or as a finishing touch. It breaks through that smoke and char. And, of course, it’s great on salads.\nIngredients:\n1/4 cup fresh lime juice (from 2 to 3 limes), or to taste\n3/4 cup olive oil\n2 T honey, or to taste\n1 tsp. kosher salt, or to taste\nInstructions:\nWhisk all the ingredients in a small bowl until emulsified, then taste—everything should be in balance: the acid of the lime, the sweetness of the honey, the salinity of the salt. If anything is too faint, add more of whatever is missing. The vinaigrette will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator; whisk again before serving to re-emulsify it.\nPapaya Grapefruit Sauce\nMakes about 2 cups\nIngredients:\n1/2 papaya, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces\n1/2 cup fresh grapefruit juice\n1/4 cup honey\n1/4 cup water\n1 tsp. kosher salt\nInstructions:\nAdd all the ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth, about 30 seconds. The sauce should have the consistency of sour cream. It tends to thicken as it stands; if it seems a little too thick, give it a stir to loosen it up.\nNOTE: How to Suprême Citrus\nThis is a classic restaurant technique for trimming off all the peel and bitter pith and separating the sections from the membranes so that all that is left is fruit. The secret is to use a supersharp knife, which will cut with little effort; if the knife is dull, you’ll need to apply some pressure, and that’s where you get into trouble.\nFirst, slice off the top and bottom of the fruit so that you see two tiny circles of flesh. Then, slice off the skin, pith, and outer membrane, following the curvature of the fruit. Trim off any white patches left after you cut off all the peel.\nNow you can either stop here and just cut the fruit into 1/2-inch slices, or you can follow this standard chef’s technique. Holding the fruit in one hand and the knife in the other, working over a small bowl, slice as close as possible to the membranes that separate the sections: Slice along one, then the other, and flick the loosened section into the bowl. When the entire fruit has been sectioned, squeeze the juice from the remaining membranes with your hand and reserve for another use.\nPiña-Habanero Margarita\nMakes 1 drink\nThick, fruity, spicy: This is a margarita with a lot of personality. It’s also a drink best made in batches. If you do your prep ahead of time (infuse the tequila with the habanero 36 hours before; puree fresh pineapple in a blender earlier in the day), you can mix together one round after another after your guests arrive. A trick from behind the bar: Shake the drink and pour two-thirds of it into the glass, then shake the rest of the drink again before topping it off so that the margarita has a slightly frothy head.\nIngredients:\nTable salt\nChile Lime Salt (recipe follows)\n1 scant shot tequila reposado\n1/2 shot Habanero Tequila (recipe follows)\n1/2 shot Cointreau\n1/2 cup pineapple puree (or substitute fresh pineapple juice)\nInstructions:\nCombine all the liquor and the pineapple puree in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake vigorously. Pour into the glass (see headnote) and serve.\nHabanero Tequila\nIngredients:\n4 ozs. tequila reposada, 100 percent agave\n1 habanero, halved\nInstructions:\n1. Pour some table salt onto a small plate and the chile lime salt onto another one. Moisten the rim of a glass and roll it in the table salt, then in the chile salt.\n2. Combine the tequila and habanero in a jar, seal tightly, and let infuse for 36 hours. (You can go as little as 24 hours or as long as 48 hours, depending on how much heat you want.) Remove the habanero and reseal the jar.\nChile Lime Salt\nMakes about 2 tablespoons\nOur version of a finishing salt, this brings a note of intrigue to any dish. It’s simple to make: Toast dried árbol chiles in a cast-iron pan, pulverize them in a spice grinder, and mix in lime zest and salt. That’s it. The smoky, spicy, tangy salt is just the right flourish for grilled fish, but you can use it in or on just about any dish. We sprinkle it over the odd-shaped pieces left over when we make jicama salad, or you could use it on radishes or eggs.\nIngredients:\n4 dried árbol chiles\n2 T kosher salt\nGrated zest of 3 limes\nInstructions:\nToast the chiles in a dry cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Let cool. Pulse the chiles in a spice grinder to a fine powder. Mix with the salt and lime zest. Store in a tightly sealed jar in a cool place.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/157965620X", "http://www.hartwoodtulum.com/"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:35:03.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
