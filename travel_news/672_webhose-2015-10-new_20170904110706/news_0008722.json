In that time, he has gone from providing general venue support, such as organising teas and coffees, to being responsible for a team of eight front of house and service support staff. Since 2004, the busy, AIM Gold accredited venue has grown by 400 per cent and was named UK’s No 1 Specialist Venue and Overall Venue in BDCR Continental’s VenueVerdict Awards 2014, in which Olivier is referenced on multiple occasions for his expertise and organisational skills. David Vaughton, director of venues for EEF Venues, said:”In an organisation that has built its entire reputation on customer service excellence, Ollie Nanchi is a true ambassador of the EEF Venues’ brand. He constantly strives for perfection and has an eye for detail, taking great pride to ensure that all of the 16 conference rooms have been set up impeccably. His customer service skills are legendary, reflected in the fact that repeat bookings account for 78% of the venue’s business, testament to the relationships he and his colleagues build with clients. His patience, understanding and good humour have earned the respect and admiration of all.” Ollie Nanchi said: “This has been an amazing experience for me and it is wonderful to get recognition for something I do every day. I feel truly humbled to have been put forward for this award and to be acknowledged in this way.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:00:59.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
