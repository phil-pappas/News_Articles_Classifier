Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant Management.\nThe students began the intense, 16-month curriculum at EHL in Switzerland in early September. They’ll spend their second semester at SHTM in Hong Kong, and after three months in residence with an international hospitality company, they’ll finish the program and their third semester at Hilton College in Houston.\n“This program is unique in that it gives students a truly global perspective of hospitality under the guidance of industry and academic leaders on three continents, which is invaluable in this ever-expanding, worldwide industry,” said Dr. Ki-Joon Back, Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies at Hilton College.\nWhile they’re earning this prestigious degree, students will also gain firsthand insight about the global hotel and tourism markets and unparalleled industry exposure through professional certifications, a rigorous capstone project and business field trips to hospitality hubs across the world like Paris, Macau and New York.\nStudents accepted into the program choose which school will grant their degree and receive certificates from the other two institutions.”Being able to choose the degree-granting institution lets these students tailor their degree to their post-graduation plans, while still having access to three incredible alumni networks. Specifically, a degree from UH will open more doors to them to build exceptional working relationships with the top hospitality companies based in US,” said Dr. Back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:55:03.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
