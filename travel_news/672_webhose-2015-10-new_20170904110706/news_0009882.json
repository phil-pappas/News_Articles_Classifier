These first floor rooms boast private balconies overlooking the thriving Bermondsey Square and antique market. Reinforcing the community spirit, the winning design contributed by local Architecture students has inspired the exterior gardens bordering the rooms. \nThese new Terrace Rooms will add to the hotel’s personality, individuality and soul - fusing an industrial aesthetic with London views and providing a contemporary hub for millennials. The first floor Terrace Rooms have been cleverly conceptualised by design firms Offset Architects and Fileturn. Meanwhile, the private balconies have been individually appointed by final year Architecture students from the University of East London, led by Alex Scott-Whitby of Scott Whitby Studio and mentored by the hotel’s neighbours, Purcell Architects. The students’ brief was to be sympathetic to the hotel’s local history whilst considering the environment, upcycling available materials and capturing the essence of the community. Each room at The Bermondsey Square Hotel has been carefully designed with personality, trendiness and style. Accommodation includes Superior Rooms, Club Rooms and Loft Suites which have been host to many star-studded guests, including bands such as Keane and Goldfrapp. Meanwhile, guests can feel at home with a contemporary British-inspired menu, a pantry area offering home-made cakes, pastries and beverages as well as a communal lounge, melding a sense of familiarity with authentic hospitality. Guests are welcomed by staff, warmly named the ‘B2 Crew,’ who are uniformed with relaxed denim and perform various roles. Offering an alternative twist on the London city break, The Bermondsey Square Hotel is conveniently located amidst buzzing restaurants, design studios, boutique shops, an indie cinema and vibrant antiques market. A short distance away, guests can also enjoy London’s finest sights - Tower Bridge, Borough Market, The Shard and Tate Modern - whilst staying in a spirited neighbourhood.
