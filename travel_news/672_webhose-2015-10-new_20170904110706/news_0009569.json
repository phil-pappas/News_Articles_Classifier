England’s defeat by Wales at Twickenham in their World Cup Pool A match hogged the next morning’s headlines. And understandably so, given that England are hosting the Rugby World Cup, which is broadcast on terrestrial TV, and the match took place in prime time on a Saturday night. The final kilometres of Armitstead’s race took place on the other side of the Atlantic just as Stuart Lancaster’s men were imploding at Twickenham, meaning her stunning win slipped under the radar. That she has still taken top spot in the Liontrust poll for September’s sporting hero proves that the Telegraph audience is a discerning one capable of recognising a stunning individual achievement. She surged to the front on the final climbs, burned off anyone faster than her in a drag race, then bided her time, waiting for the final sprint With no disrespect to Andy Murray, whose Davis Cup heroics continue to inspire Britain’s tennis players to punch above their collective weight, and Wayne Rooney, whose achievement in passing Sir Bobby Charlton as England’s all-time leading goalscorer was a symbolic moment (rather than indicative of exceptional performances from him in September’s Euro 2016 qualifiers), Armitstead’s win was both tactically brilliant and historic. The 26-year-old became only the fourth British woman to wear the iconic rainbow-striped jersey after Beryl Burton, Mandy Jones and Nicole Cooke – and only the sixth Briton to do so in total, with Tom Simpson and Mark Cavendish the only men to achieve the feat. What is more, she did so almost entirely on her own, after her young team-mates in the Britain squad left her isolated in the final laps. However, Armitstead, the Olympic silver medal winner at London 2012, never panicked. When the race came back together on the last lap, she surged to the front on the final climbs, burned off anyone faster than her in a drag race, then bided her time, waiting for the final sprint, which she won.
