Said returning MICE buyer Lt. Col Akbar A. Shareef, Chairman and CEO of Rakaposhi Tours, “After 9/11, I received 29 group cancellations in 1 day. It brought my business down to a zilch, and I had to quickly change my focus from inbound tours to outbound tours. Because of IT&CMA 2014, I was able to strike a deal here and bring in 325 incentive buyers and housed them in Amari Watergate Hotel.” \n\nSeoul Tourism Organization fronted by its Executive Director Maureen O’Crowley, also revealed thoughts behind their return to the event as an exhibitor, and as a sponsor. “IT&CMA has always been important to us. It was where we got our start in 2008 when we were first established, and it feels like homecoming to us. We were big sponsors in those days, and we are again here with our own booth and sponsored function at this year’s show.” \n\nWith IT&CMA chosen to debut the first-ever ASEAN MICE Forum on 29 September, Dee Suvimol, ASEAN Secretariat of the ASEAN Tourism Marketing and Communication Working Group shared the reason behind their endorsement of the event, “ITCMA is one of the best well-known events, particularly for MICE, especially in Asia”. Sumivol also elaborated on the appeal of ASEAN as a MICE destination and how the debut forum served as an effective platform to update the industry on the latest MICE developments in the 10 ASEAN countries and share learnings from case studies on organising successful events in ASEAN. \n\nDarren Ng, Managing Director of TTG Asia Media also announced statistics of the show’s growth. He cited a 14% increase in exhibitors’ participation this year, a 25% increase in programme activities, the new Campfire Knowledge sessions as part of an expanded education program that also comprise of Keynote Address, Association Day Forum and CTW Conference sessions, and participation from industry partners (Union of International Associations, Singapore Tourism Board) co-locating their events together with the show. “IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific will continue to play an active role in educating the market and helping the market to grow.” \n\nReady clips already released in partnership with International Meetings Review include the following, with more interviews to be released over the next couple of weeks: \n\n· Organiser, Darren Ng, Managing Director of TTG Asia Media· Host Committee Partner, Nopparat Maythaveekulchai, President of Thailand Convention & Exhibition Bureau· Keynote Speaker, Gary Grimmer, CEO, GainingEdge· Industry Partner, Dee Suvimol, ASEAN Secretariat· Exhibitor/Sponsor, Maureen O’Crowley, Executive Director, MICE Division of Seoul Tourism Organization· Exhibitor, Ian Stazicker, Group Marketing Director of Value Retail China· Exhibitor, Christophe Verstraete, Executive Director of euromic· Exhibitor, Anja Loetscher, Director of Geneva Convention Bureau· MICE Buyer, Lt.
