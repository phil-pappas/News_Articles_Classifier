The electronic miscellaneous document (EMD) standard allows an agent to efficiently purchase an airline’s ancillary products on behalf of travellers in the same way they would purchase a base airfare. This will enable Virgin Australia to make their ancillary products broadly available and easy to buy through all channels.\n“Virgin Australia is an important Sabre customer and we are wholly-committed to supporting their global growth across all their sales channels,” said Roshan Mendis, senior vice president, Sabre, Asia Pacific. “Our investments in industry-leading technology and data analytics give Virgin Australia an edge by providing unique insights that they can use to convert travel demand into bookings. Additionally, our merchandising capabilities enable Virgin Australia to market and sell their fares and ancillaries in a way that’s easy for corporations, travel management companies, travel agencies and consumers to shop and book.”\nThis new agreement follows Virgin Australia’s recent decision to renew and expand its technology agreement with Sabre for SabreSonic Customer Sales & Service (CSS) reservations system.\nVirgin Australia Chief Commercial Officer Judith Crompton said: “Sabre’s technology will make it easier for agents to purchase our fares, ancillaries and optional extras, while enabling us to share details of our products and services. Our agreement with Sabre will help to drive revenue and support our goal to provide a seamless, world-class customer experience to all of our passengers.”\nVirgin Australia joins more than 400 global carriers that leverage Sabre technology to market and sell airfares and ancillaries.\nSource:- Sabre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:26:47.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
