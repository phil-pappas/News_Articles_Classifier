Work will follow to adapt All Saints so that it will provide a highly attractive venue suitable for the 21st century and beyond. Work will begin in April 2016 and the Beonna Centre will open early in 2017.\nA very diverse range of activities are planned for the Beonna Centre including a community café, clubs and classes for all ages and the staging of events such as concerts, exhibitions and conferences. There will be a wide variety of opportunities for volunteers to become involved whatever their interests. These opportunities will range from a chance to learn traditional building and other heritage skills to helping with all aspects of the new centre. These opportunities are available now and there will be free training if required. The Trust warmly welcomes all enquiries.\nCommenting on the award Kevin Pinner, Chairman of Benington Community Heritage Trust, said: “We’re delighted that HLF has given us this support. All Saints is a very beautiful building which has been at the heart of the community for over 800 years. Now we will be able to give it a sustainable future so it can continue to play an important part in the lives of present and future generations. We are very grateful to all those who have helped us achieve our goal, especially the Churches Conservation Trust, the Diocese of Lincoln and the Architectural Heritage Fund, their support has been invaluable.”\n“…this investment will not only conserve a unique building of national importance but also affect transformative change in the lives of local people.”\nCrispin Truman, CEO at Churches Conservation Trust\nCrispin Truman, CEO at Churches Conservation Trust, said: “The Churches Conservation Trust is delighted with the news that Benington Community Heritage Trust has received a second-round award of £1.8million from HLF in support of the Beonna project.
