The delegation, which arrived in Italy for #OmanWomenWeek, is made up entirely of women; the picture that they have painted, at Expo2015, is one of a country at the vanguard when it comes to the rights of women, who themselves have been seen as a fundamental resource for the development of society, the economy and the politics of the Sultanate.\nOman will display the gentle side of its rich and fascinating culture, for all visitors to enjoy. Guests also got an idea of the unique female influence on the Sultanate’s traditions. Every day from 11am to 5 pm at the Oman Pavilion, there were chefs, musicians, stylists, artists and craftspeople. Colours, flavours and traditions are there to be enjoyed, in a corner of Oman that is enchanting and unexpected. Three days of cooking shows, live music, the traditional Oud with its intense sounds, was listened to; furthermore, richly fascinating clothes, made with precious fabrics and vivid colours, embellished with handmade jewels, was modelled in front of the public. Oman’s welcome will also involve good food, with food tasting and delicious typical dishes prepared there and then.\nAll visitors interested in trying typical Omani cuisine can go, up until the end of Expo2015, to the Al Sablah restaurant, found in the Pavilion of the Sultanate of Oman. The Al Sablah restaurant offers a fusion menu, with specialities from the Arabian Peninsula and the most exquisite Asian flavours. The menu includes some of the most well-known dishes such as tabbouleh, hummus, and sea food salad, as well as special dishes like Ghouza, a dish with ancient origins, made from lamb and fish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:24:48.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
