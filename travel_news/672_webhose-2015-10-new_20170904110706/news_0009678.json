I bid $120 for a 3Â&frac12;-star hotel in the area I wanted, figuring that 3Â&frac12; stars was high enough that I wouldn't find any rude surprises. Because of a bad back, the rude surprise I feared most was the requirement to climb stairs. I was pleased that my bid was accepted, but that pleasure evaporated quickly when I checked on the hotel and found that it had no elevator and even the front door was up about a half-story stairway. Clearly, I couldn't stay there, so I booked another hotel and figured that my nonrefundable Priceline bid was tuition for further education.\nAnother type of opaque buying involves \"mystery\" deals from what are otherwise advertised-price agencies. DealNews.com just published a new report on mystery hotel deals, with mixed results:\n The price of a \"4-star French Quarter mystery hotel\" in New Orleans turned out to be a few dollars higher than the advertised price of a well-reviewed 4-star hotel on Kayak. Would the mystery hotel have been a lot better? DealNews didn't know.\n The mystery price for a two-person four-night flight/hotel package in Puerto Rico, at $1031, came out to $74 to $188 less than the best comparable deal the investigators could find. But they were underwhelmed, given that they regularly saw less expensive promotional deals from online agencies.\nOverall, London was my only bad experience with opaque buying. For the most part, I've done very well: All other successful opaque bids have given me acceptable accommodations in the desired areas and cut my bill by $50 to $100 per night compared with the regular prices for comparable hotels. But experience leads me to three guidelines:\n Always check one or more of the bidding websites for information on recent bidding results: BetterBidding.com, BiddingForTravel.com, HotelDealsRevealed.com,OnlyBidding.com, and BiddingTraveler.com.\n Keep your bids or mystery buying at a 4-star or higher category; you're risking disappointment if you go too low.\n Check out list prices on hotels you might like, then bid somewhere between 50% and 70% of that price. Given Priceline and Hotwire fees, bidding just slightly lower doesn't make sense.\nI've never tried an opaque air ticket bid, and I never will; schedule and other factors are too important to me. Still, some trips are probably safe, on nonstop routes either where most airline schedules are about the same or where connection requirements limit you to very few options.\nAnd some travelers like the idea of \"wing it\" travel. Many years ago, before the advent of low advance-purchase fares, a priest I knew, at the start of his vacation, packed his suitcase, approached the PanAm counter at San Francisco International Airport, and asked, \"When is the next flight?\" \"Next flight to where?\" queried the puzzled agent, to which the priest responded, \"Wherever the next flight goes.\" The agent told him, he bought a ticket, and took off on his trip.\nToday's airfare system limits precludes that priestly approach. But DealNews did check out a \"mystery destination\" offer where buyers don't find out the destination until after they buy a ticket. The promotion was a flat rate round-trip fare of $75 per person on Germanwings from Germany to a range of mystery destinations including Rome, Venice, Barcelona, and London. DealNews found that the promotional fare was $100 to $300 less than advertised fares on low-fare lines, so the trip was a great deal to anyone who would be happy to visit any of destination on that diverse list.\nThe take-away from the mystery flight result is similar to the case of hotels: Don't pay for a pig in the poke until you've carefully searched the advertised prices of what appear to be comparable options. And don't make a commitment unless the opaque deal is better than -- a lot better than -- the comparable advertised price.\n-- 30 --\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins(at)mind.net.
