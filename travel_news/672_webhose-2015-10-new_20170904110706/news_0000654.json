Cella was recognized for its innovative solid hydrogen material that brings a safe, high-performance, zero-carbon, low-cost power supply to the aviation, unmanned aircraft system (UAS), transportation and portable energy industries.\n\"ICIS is a highly esteemed organization, so gaining recognition for our innovative product is very rewarding,\" said Dr. Stephen Bennington , managing director of Cella Energy. \"This is a big step towards the proliferation of our technology into the energy market and we are grateful to receive this award.\"\nCella has developed a proprietary hydrogen technology that provides a low-weight solid hydrogen fuel source. Cella's plastic-like material safely stores hydrogen and releases it as gas when heated above 100 degrees Celsius. Each gram of the material produces approximately one liter of hydrogen gas, giving it a very high specific energy (energy per unit weight). The technology offers a higher energy alternative to lithium-ion batteries and a zero carbon substitute for hydrocarbon based fuels in a wide array of applications including aerospace, defense, and consumer products.\nICIS is the world's largest petrochemical market information provider with a fast-growing energy division. The ICIS Innovation Awards are presented annually to companies who demonstrate high levels of innovation in products, processes and ways of doing business. Organizations are also recognized for providing benefits to environmental and sustainability initiatives.\nAbout Cella Energy\nCella Energy is an advanced materials company pioneering safe, high-performance, low-cost hydrogen energy. Its headquarters are located at the Rutherford Appleton Lab complex in the U.K., and its U.S. operations are based at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida . The company's proprietary solid hydrogen technology has applications in numerous sectors where a light-weight, safe, stable and clean power is needed. The power systems that Cella develops have advantages over lithium-polymer batteries, as well as highly pressurized gas and other forms of hydrogen storage.\n releases/cella-energy-awarded-prestigious-icis-chemical-award-300160465.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cella-energy-awarded-prestigious-icis-chemical-award-300160465.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=FL28346&Transmission_Id=201510190800PR_NEWS_USPR_____FL28346&DateId=20151019", "http://www.cellaenergy.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.icis.com/awards/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:19:50.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
