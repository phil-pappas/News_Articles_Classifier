PUBLISHED: 11:29, Fri, Oct 23, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:54, Fri, Oct 23, 2015 GETTY The Mayor of Magaluf has spoken out about the town's reputation \nMagaluf's tourist board must have been banging their heads against the walls in recent years, thanks to young holiday-makers causing scandal with their alcohol fuelled antics and steamy sex games. \nBut it seems the resort's new socialist mayor is eager to prove the party island once coined 'Sh*galuf' has transformed and that the days of binge drinking and lewd behaviour are long gone.

GETTY The beaches are renowned for being fabulous and sunny \nThe new rules included fines of up to €3,000 for those caught drinking, urinating or getting naked in the street, new laws against “balconing” (the craze of jumping from hotel balconies), and limits on the number of bar crawls and the way in which they are run. \nBritish police were even deployed into the area to monitor bad behaviour. \nAnd just months after the new rules were enforced, Mayor of Calvia Rodriguez is convinced Magaluf is now a changed place. \nManuel Onieva said: \"We didn’t actually forsee [the efforts to cut down on drunken behaviour] being so smooth. \n\"We have improved the experience for tourists and we are now no longer in the news for bad coverage. There has been a major decrease in infractions, arrests, balconing and all kins of illegal or anti-social behaviour.” GETTY He insisted that from the summer of 2014, there had been 50 per cent less arrests \nHe added: “Pub crawling is disappearing. The establishments have cooperated in enforcing the regulations. There is a consensus about what needs to be done. There is evolution in the resort.” \nHe insisted that from the summer of 2014, there had been 50 per cent less arrests, 66 per cent less incidents of balconing, and that the number of pub crawls breaching the rules had fallen from 14 in 2013 to just one in 2015. \nHe also said that the resort had also seen a 2.8 per cent increase in occupancy rates, of which families and couples were up 3 per cent and under 25s were down 2.6 per cent. \nWill you be heading off to Magaluf next summer for a family holiday?
