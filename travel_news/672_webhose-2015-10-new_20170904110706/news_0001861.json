It also sketches the original settlement by the Washoe tribe, details the Chinese construction of the railroad tunnel through the pass and the advent of I-80.\nIt’s a fine monument to all forms of travel and the innately American yen for exploration and adventure. But, be honest, it’s the Donner Party and cannibalism (not sensationally featured in museum displays and literature but duly noted in the aptly titled “Desperation” display) that drew the healthy crowd of tourists I encountered on one recent afternoon.\nPeople lingered over the life-size cardboard cutouts of women and children huddled in threadbare blankets, accompanied by a broken wagon wheel half buried in fake snow. They stared at the exploded text stenciled on the wall: “STARVING, they ate the bodies of dead companions.”\nMuseum exhibits tend to lend themselves to quiet contemplation in even the most buoyant of galleries, but no one said a word here for minutes as they read display boards with unsettling headings such as “Trapped by Snow,” “A Fateful Decision,” “Death and Banishment” and “Terrible News.”\nFinally, as if seeking to lighten everyone’s psychic load, a woman in a sleeveless red polka-dotted blouse and khaki shorts turned to a stranger beside her and said, in a deep Southern drawl, “Always stay on the trail.” Then she shook her head and repeated the admonition, wise words even today.\nWhat Texan Michele Sides pointed out with her “Always stay on the trail” refrain is that, at its most basic, the Donner Party story is just a family (actually, multiple families’) road trip gone horribly awry.\nAs presented at the visitors center, the Donner Party tragedy also is a cautionary tale about patience, or lack thereof. Rather than traveling by the established route, the Reed and Donner men were hellbent on taking a 300-mile shortcut that an explorer named Lansford Hastings swore would get them there.\nAs Jesse Quinn Thornton wrote in an 1848 account of the trek, “Mrs. George Donner was ... gloomy, sad and dispirited ... that her husband and others could think for a moment of leaving the old road.”\nAlthough the cannibalism angle is basically glossed over, we do get a good idea of the other entrees on which the Donner Party feasted: a thin soup of boiled animal hides and bones, bark and pine twigs, dirt. Many in the 89-member group stayed alive on such a diet until rescued. (About three dozen others perished.)\nA popular display is headed: “Why Did Women Survive?” Answer: “Women’s smaller bodies give them an advantage because they need fewer calories than men. With more body fat, women have more energy reserves.”\nThe rest of the visitors center is decidedly more upbeat, extolling the wonders of the road, with exhibits titled “The Freedom of Travel,” “Open Road Adventures” and “From Dirt to Asphalt: Transforming Donner Pass.” The themes are perfect for tourists wanting affirmation that they are partaking in a grand tradition of travel.\n“This is really nice,” said Steve Overhoff, visiting with his wife, Bethany. “We didn’t expect to see all the stuff about the train tunnels and old Highway 40.”\nHowever, he acknowledged that they came for the Donner Party.\n“Everybody thinks of the cannibalism story, but in reality, it was the don’t -take-a-short-cut-that’s-not-proven story and how easy it was to mislead everybody,” Overhoff said. “Google maps can mislead you, too.”\nThe two were soon finished perusing the aisles and had returned to their car. But other travelers streamed in to what has proved to be a popular state park stop.\nOne thing to know in advance, though, before making the long trek up the mountain: Bring provisions because they don’t sell food at the Donner visitors center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:14:37.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
