LOUIS , Oct. 9, MOTOsafety, the #1 solution on the market that prevents teen accidents on the road, is promoting National Teen Driver Safety Week ( October 18-24, 2015 ) with resources to support parents in the \"5 to Drive Campaign.\" According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the goal of this campaign is to encourage parents to talk to their teen drivers about important driving safety rules. MOTOsafety is challenging parents to have their child sign the \"MOTOsafety Pledge\" and to discuss the pledge in detail with their teen.\nThe pledge is a tool to guide parents through the conversation about the major impairments to safe driving. The pledge covers positive and negative behavior commitments in three key areas: rules of the road, distracted driving, and responsible behavior. It is a thorough set of talking points that covers the \"5 to Drive\" rules of the road and much more, including issues such as texting/drinking and driving.

MOTOsafety is a GPS device for your vehicle that monitors your child's driving behaviors such as speeding, tailgating, rolling stop signs, and curfews. The device gives parents peace of mind of knowing where their child is and how well they are driving without their supervision. MOTOsafety provides valuable resources to help parents through all the challenging conversations with their teen with their partnerships with National Highway Safety Administration (NHTSA), Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and National Safety Council (NSC).\nAccording to the NHTSA, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teenagers 14-18 years old in the United States . Parents are encouraged to learn more about what they can do to prevent future accidents by preparing their child to drive through MOTOsafety's comprehensive driving education course available here http://www.motosafety.com/blog/driving-resources/ .\nAbout Agilis Systems, LLC:\nAgilis Systems, LLC is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company specializing in providing vehicle telematics including MOTOsafety, your teen driving coach.
