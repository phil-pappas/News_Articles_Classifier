They have a huge responsibility.' \nHe has highlighted the term 'at risk of showers' as being a key to putting tourists off visiting the region of Normandy, and is annoyed that forecasts are generalized for a region of almost 650 miles. \n'They also give the impression that if it's going to rain in Cherbourg for example then it's raining across the northern coast of France; we are given the impression the weather is the same in Brest, Brittany as it is in Pas-de-Calais,' he added. \nHe is now hoping to pull the general public and politicians together and install webcams around Normandy so the weather forecasts can be more accurate from area to area. \nNormandy is famous for being the site of the D-Day landings where Allied forces landed on the beaches to plan a surprise attack on the Nazis during the Second World War. \nMillions of tourists from all over the world each year visit the scenes where the battles took place and the war monuments found throughout the region to remember those who lost their lives.
