Operation Open Arms is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide U.S. service men and women visiting southwest Florida with an extensive range of R&R benefits free of charge during their two-week combat leave or return from a foreign duty station. A nationally acclaimed military outreach program, Operation Open Arms offers more free services to U.S. service men and women than any other 501(c)3 organization in the country. Its long list of services provided includes dental care, car repairs, financial assistance, fishing and hunting trips, funeral support, job placement, medical assistance for PTSD, and wedding assistance, to name a few. Since its founding in 2005, it has given support to more than 3,000 service men and women. Through the participation of more than 288 businesses and individuals, over the years Operation Open Arms has provided benefits worth nearly $12 million.\nMark Mettelman , President and CEO of Triad Advisors, said, \"Operation Open Arms, which grew from the genuine gratitude of one individual for the selfless contribution made by our nation's service men and women, over the years has provided tremendous support to so many U.S. troops and their families. We are thrilled and honored to have raised this amount from our employees, advisors and strategic business partners to further the benefits provided by this generous program.\"\nCaptain John \"GiddyU p\" Bunch, who founded Operation Open Arms, said, \"I am extremely grateful to accept this contribution to further our work on behalf of America's service men and women. As an organization that pays no salaries and relies completely on donations, the funds raised by Triad will go a very long way in enabling us to continue to provide help to our service men and women who are in need of assistance or just some R&R during a brief military leave or after returning from the rigors of a tour of duty.\"\nThis year's fundraising event for Operation Open Arms continued Triad Advisors' longstanding tradition of supporting charitable organizations that serve and assist members of America's military in the communities where Triad's National Conference is held.\nAbout Operation Open Arms\nOperation Open Arms was started in 2005 when Captain John \"GiddyU p\" Bunch, one of Florida's top professional fishing guides, spontaneously offered to provide a free fishing charter to a serviceman whose only wish was to go fishing while on combat leave. Since then, it has expanded to a network of over 288 local businesses, associations, and individuals that support American troops and enthusiastically contribute time, energy, expertise, equipment, facilities, and more. Designated a public charity by the IRS in 2008, Operation Open Arms has no payroll or salaries and is devoid of political or religious affiliation. Its mission is \"to provide U.S. service men and women visiting Southwest Florida every conceivable benefit during their two-week combat leave or return from a foreign duty station.\" For more information, please visit www.operationopenarms.org .\nAbout Triad Advisors\nHeadquartered in Atlanta, GA , Triad Advisors, Inc. is a national, independent broker-dealer and multi-custodial SEC-Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) that is an early pioneer and continued leader in the Hybrid RIA marketplace.
