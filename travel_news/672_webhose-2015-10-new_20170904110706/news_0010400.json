The Cleveland-Akron-Lorain region ranked as the 10 th -worst location in the country for particulate pollution, according to the State of the Air: 2015, a report compiled by the American Lung Association based on data compiled from 2011-2013.\nYet, in spite of the gloom-and-doom findings contained in the reports, there is a silver lining. The air in Northeast Ohio is actually getting cleaner, even as federal pollution standards have become stricter in recent years in an effort to improve public health.\n\"Over time, things are getting better,\" said Joe MacDonald, NOACA's manager of environmental planning.\n\"But the reality is that we continue to be in non-attainment in several areas of pollutants. We want clean air for the region, and I hope we can educate people about the ramifications of the decisions they make.\"\nPARTICULATE MATTER\nIn the 45 years since passage of the Clean Air Act, numerous studies have found that air quality has improved and tens of thousands of premature deaths from heart and lung disease have been averted due to the removal of particulate matter from the air.\nParticulate matter are the microscopic pieces of soot, smoke, dirt, dust and liquid in the air that are byproducts of burning fossil fuels at factories, power plants and in automobiles. They are considered the most harmful form of air pollution because they are able to bypass the body's defenses and be inhaled into the lungs.\nParticle pollution can worsen the symptoms of asthma, as well as cause eye, lung and throat irritation, cause trouble breathing, lung cancer, low birth weight in babies, and trigger heart attacks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nAs particulate pollution has been cleaned up in the United States, the life expectancies in major metropolitan areas have improved remarkably, said Michael Greenstone, a professor at the University of Chicago.\nIn a recent op-ed piece in The New York Times, Greenstone wrote that residents of such metropolises as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, as well as industrial cities such as Steubenville, can expect to live up to five years longer than children born there in 1970,\nThe State of the Air report notes that although the Cleveland area remains one of the most-polluted cities in the U.S., its latest report marked the area's lowest particulate pollution data in history.\nThe seven worst particulate pollution locations were all in California. The Cincinnati area was eighth worst in the country. No Ohio cities were among the cleanest in the country for particulate pollution.\nNone of the counties in Northeast Ohio are in violation of federal pollution standards for carbon monoxide or nitrogen dioxide.\nOZONE\nWhen nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) combine in the atmosphere, they are cooked by ultraviolet radiation and form ozone, a toxic gas that contributes to a variety of serious respiratory illnesses.\nSignificant contributors of these ozone ingredients in Northeast Ohio are emissions from cars, trucks, trains, boats, and lawn care equipment, plus coal-burning power plants.\nWilliam Neff/The Plain Dealer Only Lake County in Northeast Ohio exceeds the federal ozone standards. NOACA's MacDonald explained that prevailing winds from the southwest pick up the ozone that has been cooking in the atmosphere above Lorain, Cuyahoga, Summit and Medina counties, and carry it into Lake County.\n\"In reality, a lot of it comes from cars, not from factories belching smoke out of stacks,\" MacDonald said. \"We don't have the traffic of Chicago and Los Angeles, but we have a lot of people driving.\"\nIn Northeast Ohio, 84 percent of drivers travel alone â€“ which is well above the national average, which is in the mid-70s, McDonald said.\n\"Your choice of transportation mode affects the air quality and the health of the region,\" MacDonald said.\nPrior to this week, federal regulations required three-year average readings of 75 parts per billion of ozone to comply with the Clean Air Act. Air monitors in Lake County have detected readings of 78 ppb from 2012-2014, according to NOACA's latest report.\nOn Thursday, the Obama Administration tightened the ozone limit to 70 ppb, and considered an even stricter ozone standard of 65 ppb. Under the tighter restrictions, all of the counties in the region except Summit and Portage would be in violation, as well as 34 of the state's 88 counties.\nThe USEPA proposed reducing ozone levels based on increasing evidence that ozone is responsible for a variety of respiratory illnesses, it can exacerbate asthma and bronchitis, and scar the lungs over the long term.\nTrish Demeter of the Ohio Environmental Council said the group strongly advocates for stricter pollution regulations.\n\"We are seeing better air quality in different parts of the state, but we can always do better,\" said Demeter, the OEC's managing director of energy and clean air programs.\nHistory has shown that whenever the government sets new pollution standards, the market and technology catches up, she said.\n\"Car and truck manufacturers have responded to these standards and will continue to get better,\" Demeter said. \"We think technology is a great hope for achieving these standards and we should move in that direction.\"\nThere are financial incentives for complying with clean air laws, NOACA said, citing data from the USEPA. Lowering ozone standards to 70 ppb, for example, would generate from $6 billion to $13 billion in public health benefits. Lowering the standards to 65 ppb would increase benefits to $19 billion to $38 billion, NOACA said.\nThe tradeoff is with the cost to businesses affected by the new stricter regulations. The OEPA cited a study that predicted a 65 ppb standard could cost Ohio businesses $22 billion during the next 23 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:39:28.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
