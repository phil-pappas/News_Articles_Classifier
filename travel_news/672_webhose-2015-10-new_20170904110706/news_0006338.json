Love it or leaf it. Legalize Limitless Salad. Make Mac Not War.\nThose are three of 10 messages created by Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp ., the parent company of Souplantation, in a fun campaign that is literally just hitting the streets in San Diego neighborhoods.\n\"Having fun with words is always cool, especially when food is involved,\" says Garden Fresh CEO John Morberg . \"So we thought wouldn't it be fun to look at humorous, satirical, and well-recognized bumper stickers and parody them with various foods that we offer in our Souplantation restaurants.\"\nThe result is a campaign designed by Garden Fresh advertising agency Krueger Communications. It started with an idea of \"chroming\" the back of select San Diego buses and then developing oversize bumper stickers so it would visually look like an automobile bumper sticker.\nThe four-month campaign is just underway and involves the 10 messages on 10 area transit buses. So far, only three buses are on the street and the other seven will be added very soon. Smaller versions of the bumper stickers will be available to Club Veg members in area restaurants as well. Club Veg provides information on in-store food offerings via email to members.\n\"It is still early in our effort, but the buzz this is creating is exciting,\" Morberg says. \"This campaign is another way for us to highlight our 'Discover Fresh' message by creating unique ways to showcase our fresh, made-from-scratch food.\"\nIn addition to the bus campaign, Souplantation has a humorous radio advertising campaign that features the voice of Patrick Warburton , an American actor perhaps best known from his role as David Puddy on the Seinfeld television series.\nAbout Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp.\nEach day begins fresh at 125 company-owned Garden Fresh restaurants in 15 states. More than 300 million guests since 1978 have helped us to be number one in fresh produce and salads, made-from-scratch soups, hot pastas, freshly baked breads and muffins, fresh fruit, desserts, and more.
