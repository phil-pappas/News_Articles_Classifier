Elingburg \nSpecial to The Post and Courier Oct 23 2015 1:02 pm Susan Klein’s “Eye” Two profound, exciting exhibits are on display starting Saturday at the Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art. \nIf you go \nWhat: Jiha Moon’s “Double Welcome, Most Everyone is Mad Here” and Susan Klein’s “Shadow Things” exhibits \nWhere: The Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art, 161 Calhoun St. \nWhen: On display Oct. 24-Dec. 5. \nCost: Admission to the galleries is free. \nDetails: The opening reception from 6:30-8 p.m. Friday will be open to the public and include complimentary refreshments and light hors d’oeuvres, provided by Whole Foods and Icebox. Both exhibits, Jiha Moon’s “Double Welcome, Most Everyone is Mad Here” and Susan Klein’s “Shadow Things,” contain ominous titles of the best kind. Moon’s title is the less immediately ominous of the two, conjuring up the twisting fairy-tale world of Lewis Carroll’s “Through the Looking Glass.” And she invites us in by welcoming us twice to a different kind of wonderland. This duality (and plurality) is as much a part of her work as the title implies. Klein’s exhibit, “Shadow Things,” is nonspecific and nightmarish, appropriate for an exhibit that opens a week before Halloween, the night where darkness and shadowy activities take place. But Klein’s art doesn’t tilt toward darkness as much as her title implies. Rather, the pieces of “Shadow Things” are built upon layers of recognizable objects and landscapes that bend and meld into something entirely new. Both Moon and Klein deal with subjects of the familiar: recognizable icons, landscapes, symbols and geographical regions. But both artists approach our notions of what we consider to be familiar and filter them through their own artistic means. And, by doing so, they make unique statements on the nature of place and identity. But you shouldn’t let such highbrow descriptions deter you from enjoying the work of these two exceptional artists. Moon’s work contains elements that are immediately recognizable to passive observers of popular culture. By including cultural staples such as fortune cookies and smart phone emojis, Moon turns our perception of Asian identity on its head, and with good reason. Born in Korea but based in Atlanta, Moon leaps headfirst into the realm of cultural preconceived notions and uses her pieces to address what Western culture typically thinks of Eastern culture. With two hands firmly in both worlds, Moon isn’t afraid to use humor or satire to make us think. In one of her pieces, she emblazons the phrase, “Bless Your Heart” across a background of exotic birds and tiger masks. It’s a phrase any good Southerner will recognize, but remember; outside of the geographical South, this phrase is just as odd as the Mad Hatter’s tea party. Deeper down the rabbit hole, Klein’s artwork offers a starker vision than Moon’s bright colors and collages, but her subjects are no less compelling. Her color palette is occasionally muted but pops with unexpected color in various spots: a red shape or a green background to punctuate her paintings. Klein’s paintings come across like ruinous landscapes with chains, bricks and fences populating her pieces. But not all of her spaces reside in the shadows of her exhibit’s title. Klein drags overlooked areas of our daily lives out into the open and casts a curious light on them. Paintings that at first may appear dreary or dismal become more vibrant the longer you view them. Klein’s work may not seem immediately accessible, but such is the nature of shadows: dark objects often attract more light than we realize. With Moon and Klein exploring two sides of perceptions, a compelling show is on the horizon.
