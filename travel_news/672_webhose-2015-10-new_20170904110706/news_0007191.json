Gadgets that purport to make TSA screening easier for business travelers frequently cross my desk, so I confess that my eyes glazed over when I received this pitch. But the possibility was so enticing that I found myself clicking back, albeit with my bullshit detector prudently engaged. The website described their FastPass system as a zip-open compartment of padded pockets contoured to keep a computer, tablet, phone and all their attendant cables, peripherals, even an auxiliary power pack ‘fiercely protected’ but still visible for security. \nBut it wasn’t until I noticed the company’s ‘test drive’ offer --- take delivery, pack your stuff, wheel it around your house (no flying, skiing, or road trips of course) and if you’re disappointed, send the suitcase back within 30 days for a full refund, shipping included --- that I surrendered to my curiosity. The tough ballistic bag that arrived was smart looking, smooth rolling, and at 22 inches, roomy enough for a midweek business trip yet easy to hoist into an overhead bin. Still, I’m a doubter where luggage is concerned, and it was only after I managed to fit my entire array of electronics into the nest of compartments that I decided to give this bag the crucial airport test.
