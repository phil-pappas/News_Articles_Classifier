Porters, cooks and travel guides have been the worst hit.\n“The recent decline in tourist arrivals has worried everyone in the industry. It seems I have to look for another job now after working as a tourist guide for so many years,” said Sheshkanta Sharma, a trekking guide in Pokhara.\nHe attributed a number of reasons, including the terrible blizzard in the Annapurna region last year followed by the April 25 earthquake as well as ongoing bandh and strikes, to the decline in tourist arrivals. “Earlier, I would earn up to Rs 1.5 lakh in a single tourist season during Autumn and nearly the same amount in Spring, but this year I have been spending from my savings,” he lamented.\nAnother tourist guide Khagaraj Neupane bemoaned the hardship he had been facing to earn his livelihood these days. “Tourism industry was struggling to bounce back following the earthquake and now the protracted bandh has hit the tourism sector hard,” Neupane said, adding that most of the visitors were reluctant to visit Nepal given the ongoing political unrest in the country.\nAccording to Union of Trekking, Travels, Rafting and Airlines Workers-Nepal western regional Chairperson Bijaya KC, there are over 200 tourist guides, including 80 female guides, who earn their livelihood by serving the tourists visiting the Annapurna area and other nearby tourist destinations.\nA total of 15,000 tourists visited Annapurna area in the month of September last year while this year only 4,000 people visited the area during the same period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:57:53.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
