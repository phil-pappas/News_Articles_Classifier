Perhaps you have one or more properties that you would like to pass on to your family, treasured possessions that have great sentimental value or wealth built up from a successful career in business. For people in this position, inheritance tax (IHT) can pose a major challenge to their efforts to pass on their wealth. However, today there is a range of ways to protect your estate from IHT and enable you to remain in control of your assets. The Enterprise Investment Scheme provides a series of major tax benefits and is proving a powerful tool in inheritance tax planning. IHT explained Inheritance tax (IHT) is paid on the value of a person’s overall wealth and possessions, known as their estate, after they die. It is charged at a flat rate of 40 per cent and is payable on any assets worth more than an individual’s IHT allowance. At present, everyone has a personal IHT allowance of £325,000. However, married couples can combine their IHT allowances so that when the first spouse dies, his or her IHT allowance passes to the surviving spouse. This means that when the second spouse dies, they would have the combined IHT allowance, totalling £650,000. In July’s Budget, the Government announced a new family home allowance (FHA), set to come into force in April 2017. It will be worth an extra £100,000 on top of the £325,000 nil-rate band. This means that in total, families will be able to pass on an estate including a family home worth up to £1 million. The FHA will rise to £175,000 by April 2020. However, the family home allowance will only apply when the home is passed on to a direct descendant (child or grandchild, including adopted and foster children). It will also be gradually removed on estates worth more than £2 million at a rate of £1 for every £2 above the threshold. Reducing IHT There are several established ways to mitigate IHT bills, including the use of trusts. A trust is a legal arrangement where you give cash, property or investments to someone to look after them for the benefit of a third person. If you put things into a trust they no longer belong to you and will not be counted when your IHT bill is worked out. There is also the option to gift assets tax-free during one’s lifetime. A number of conditions apply to such gifts, such as the requirement for the gifter to live for seven years after the gift has been given for it to qualify for IHT relief. Other forms of IHT reduction include using a whole-of-life insurance policy and giving money to charity. An alternative way to mitigate IHT Alongside traditional ways to reduce IHT there are newer strategies that employ established tax incentives, such as the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS). • EIS encourages individuals to invest in private companies, which tend to be smaller and higher-risk • Individuals are allowed to invest up to £1 million per year in EIS-eligible investments and receive relief against their income tax bill at a flat rate of 30 per cent, effectively creating a £300,000 tax rebate for every £1 million invested • To qualify, the shares must be held for at least three years • Once the EIS investment has been held for two years it will normally qualify for business property relief, which means it will be excluded from your estate for IHT purposes and can be passed on free of tax • EIS also means you can defer capital gains tax (CGT) on previous gains provided they are channelled into EIS-qualifying investments. Any outstanding CGT liability lapses on death How can Mr and Mrs Smith reduce IHT? Mr and Mrs Smith have two children and expect to have an estate worth £2 million. They wish to avoid their children being forced to sell assets to pay the IHT bill. There are a number of IHT-reduction strategies they can use: 1. Using EIS: They invest the money in EIS schemes backing asset-rich business that pay an 8% annual yield, intending to hold these shares for the long term. Their benefits include: • 30% income tax relief worth up to £300,000 if they have sufficient income to generate £300,000 of tax liability (unused tax relief from the year in which the investment is made can be set against income tax paid in the previous tax year, provided that the limit for tax relief in the previous year is not exceeded as a result of the 'carry back') • an annual dividend income of £80,000 • exemption from IHT at 40% after two years under Business Property Relief, which saves the estate of Mr and Mrs Smith up to £400,000. Any capital gains tax deferred lapses on death. 2. Using a trust: They set up a testamentary trust as part of their wills with their children as beneficiaries, and settle assets worth £1.35 million on the trust. The remaining £650,000 uses up their combined IHT allowance of £325,000 each. This reduces their IHT liability from £540,000 (40 per cent of £1.35 million) to zero and allows them to retain control of the assets settled on the trust while they remain alive. A CGT liability will arise when the assets controlled by the trust are eventually sold. 3. Gifting: They gift assets worth £1.35 million to their children. Provided they survive for seven years after the date of the gift, there will be no IHT to pay on the gifted assets when they die. This reduces their IHT liability from £540,000 (40 per cent of £1.35 million) to zero, but they are no longer able to control these assets or prevent their disposal. If Mr and Mrs Smith do not survive for seven years after making the gift, some IHT will be payable on a reducing scale, according to how much time has elapsed. 4. A whole-of-life insurance policy: They put £1 million into a whole-of-life insurance policy, written in trust. This means that when they die, the policy will pay out to the trust, removing the £1 million from their estate, reducing its value for tax purposes to £1 million After allowing for their combined IHT allowances of £650,000, their estate is liable to pay tax at 40 per cent on £350,000, producing a final bill of £140,000 compared with £540,000 if they had taken no steps to mitigate their IHT liability. However, they lose control of the money invested in the insurance policy. • To find out more about private investment opportunities, visit Rockpool.uk.com Please note: your capital is at risk and there is no guarantee of return.
