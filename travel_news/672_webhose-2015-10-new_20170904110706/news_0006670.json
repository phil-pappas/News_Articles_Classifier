This is the highest quarterly profit in the Company's history. The Company's third quarter 2015 pretax margin excluding net special charges was a record 17.7 percent, up 6.7 percentage points from the same period last year. \nOn a GAAP basis, the Company reported a net profit of $1.7 billion, or $2.49 per diluted share. This compares to a GAAP net profit of $942 million in the third quarter 2014, or $1.28 per diluted share. See the accompanying notes in the Financial Tables section of this press release for further explanation, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information. \n\"We are extremely pleased to report another quarter of record profits thanks to the outstanding work of the American Airlines team,\" said Chairman and CEO Doug Parker. \"We are particularly proud of the remarkable job our team did this week to move American onto a single reservations system without any operational disruption. Because of their great work, our customers now have seamless access to the full network of the new American Airlines – the best and largest airline network in the world.\" \nRevenue and Cost Comparisons \nTotal revenue in the third quarter was $10.7 billion, a decrease of 3.9 percent versus the third quarter 2014 on a 2.9 percent increase in total available seat miles (ASMs). Consolidated passenger revenue per ASM (PRASM) was 13.16 cents, down 6.8 percent versus the third quarter 2014. Consolidated passenger yield was 15.37 cents, down 9.2 percent year-over-year. \nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter were $8.7 billion, a decrease of 11.9 percent compared to the third quarter 2014, due primarily to a 43.5 percent decrease in consolidated fuel expense. Third quarter mainline cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 11.33 cents, down 14.7 percent on a 2.6 percent increase in mainline ASMs versus the third quarter 2014. Excluding net special charges and fuel, mainline CASM was 8.56 cents, up 2.6 percent compared to the third quarter 2014. Regional CASM excluding special charges and fuel was 15.78 cents, up 1.7 percent on a 5.0 percent increase in regional ASMs versus the third quarter 2014. \nCash and Investments \nAs of Sept. 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $9.6 billion in total cash and short-term investments, of which $710 million was restricted, and an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1.8 billion. The Company continues to make significant investments in the airline through its extensive fleet renewal program, giving it the youngest fleet of the U.S. network airlines. In the third quarter, the Company took delivery of 16 new mainline and 15 new regional aircraft and retired 36 mainline and nine regional aircraft. \nIn the third quarter, the Company returned $1.63 billion to its shareholders through the payment of $67 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $1.56 billion of common stock, or 38.4 million shares, at an average price of $40.56 per share. When combined with the dividends and shares repurchased during the first half of 2015, the Company has returned approximately $2.7 billion to its shareholders this year. \nIn addition, the Company's Board of Directors has authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program to be completed by the end of 2016. This brings the total amount authorized in 2015 for share repurchases to $6.0 billion. The Company also declared a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on Nov.19, 2015, to shareholders of record as of Nov. 5, 2015. \nShare repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific number of shares or continue a dividend for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. \nApproximately $609 million of the Company's unrestricted cash and short-term investments is held in Venezuelan bolivars. This balance is valued at 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar, which is the rate that was in effect on the date the Company submitted each of its repatriation requests to the Venezuelan government. This rate is materially more favorable than the exchange rates currently prevailing for other transactions conducted outside of the Venezuelan government's currency exchange system. \nDuring 2014, the Company significantly reduced capacity in the Venezuelan market and is no longer accepting bolivars as payment for airline tickets. The Company is monitoring this situation closely and continues to evaluate its holdings of Venezuelan bolivars for additional foreign currency losses or other accounting adjustments, which could be material, particularly in light of the additional uncertainty posed by the recent changes to the foreign exchange regulations and the continued deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. More generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by the Company and can significantly affect the value of the Company's assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. \nNotable Accomplishments \nIntegration Accomplishments \n• On Oct. 17, the Company completed its transition to a single reservations system, retiring the US Airways name and website.
