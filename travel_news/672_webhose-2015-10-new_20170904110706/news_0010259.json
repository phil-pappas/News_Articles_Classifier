Change is too slow and I'm asking where's the innovation from suppliers?\"\nHowever, Paul Tilstone founder and CEO at consultancy Festive Road, argued there was innovation in the industry and challenged buyers' companies to create their own technology solutions.\nBCD Travel's senior VP of global client management Chris Crowley also defended suppliers. He said the industry was open to innovation and that most of it was consumer driven. \"As a TMC we support 27 online booking tools, around 300 apps and have 430 different profile systems. We understand every client is different.\"\nThe panel also discussed the importance of getting \"buy-in\" from the executive level when trying to implement changes in travel programmes.\nOne buyer said: \"Without c-suite support it's hard to make the changes you want. Buyers must force the issue and start having discussions with execs to gain that support.\"\nThe panel were discussing Building the next travel programme at the ACTE conference in Paris yesterday.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-10-16T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:38:08.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
