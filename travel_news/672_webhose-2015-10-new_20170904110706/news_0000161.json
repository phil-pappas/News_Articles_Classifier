I know it says that the reason for the crash isn't known but I presume that this is the usual crash spot where people come over the old railway bridge (where the Old Station Tea Rooms are) too fast and lose it. The other one seems to be coming down the hill from the other direction and clipping the raised curb on the slight corner on the down hill bit. Either way, I cannot understand how people can crash on a perfectly normal bit of road, save for taking it far too fast.
