Along a 70-mile stretch of highway, you can take in a casino, see rugged mountains, pass through one of the largest Native American reservations in Arizona, fish at a enormous lake, admire fertile farming communities that date from pioneer days and visit the most advanced astronomical observatory in the world.\nThings to note along the way:\nApache Gold Casino\nTry your luck at this casino-resort about 5 miles east of Globe, off U.S. 70. With bingo, keno, blackjack and slots, there's something for most every gambler's taste. Stop to eat at the Wickiup Buffet, Black River Grill or Apache Prime Steakhouse. If your timing's right, you might catch a show at the San Carlos Events Center. Or kick back at the Point Sports Bar & Grill.\nDetails: 800-272-2438, www.apache-gold-casino.com .\nAZCENTRAL\nBest spots to see Arizona's fall colors\nSan Carlos Reservoir\nAt the 1930 dedication of Coolidge Dam, Will Rogers looked across the grassy expanses the new lake had yet to cover and quipped, \"If this was my lake, I'd mow it.\" OK, so it took a while to fill.\nThe reservoir is a little low, but when it's full, it has more than 150 miles of shoreline and covers nearly 20,000 surface acres. Anglers come for catfish, crappie and largemouth bass. Water levels vary dramatically depending on irrigation needs, so it's best to call ahead or check online before a visit.\nThe turnoff for the lake is nearly 20 miles east of Globe. Take Indian Road 500 about 13 miles to Coolidge Dam. Recreation permits are $10 a day.\nDetails: 888-475-2343, www.sancarlosapache.com .\nGila River\nThe Gila River is the lifeblood of its valley. You can see a sea of tamarisk trees along the river for much of the drive, especially where you cross it, a few miles before Bylas. Farther southeast, farming communities stretch along the river, their well-irrigated fields a lovely green against the desert hills.\nSafford, the end point of the drive, was named after Anson Pacely Killen Safford, the territorial governor of Arizona from 1869 to 1877.\nAZCENTRAL\nScenic Drive: Willcox to Apache Pass\nDon't miss\nThe Large Binocular Telescope at the Mount Graham International Observatory is the most technologically advanced optical telescope in the world. Each of its twin mirrors measures more than 27 feet in diameter; the telescope itself weighs nearly 1.3 million pounds. Public tours are offered Fridays and Saturdays unless the Forest Service declares the Mount Graham road closed to travel. The day starts with a short orientation at the Discovery Park Campus in Safford, followed by a 90-minute drive up Mount Graham, during which you'll learn about the geology and wildlife of the Pinale√±o Mountains, as well as the region's history. After a sack lunch at the Columbine Ranger Station, visitors receive a guided tour of all three telescopes. Register at least two weeks in advance. $40 per person. 9 a.m. to about 4:30 p.m.\nDetails: 928-428-6260, eac.edu/discoverypark/mgio.shtm .\nTotal miles\nAbout 310 miles, round trip. From Phoenix, take Interstate 10 east about 10 miles. Take U.S. 60 east about 78 miles to Globe, then continue east 67 more miles to Safford on U.S. 70.
