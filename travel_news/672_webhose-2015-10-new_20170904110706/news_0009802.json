Aptly called Hell, a pitchfork's throw from George Town in Grand Cayman, the horror hamlet is home to no more than 60 brave souls, a scattering of wayward lizards and blood red hibiscus blooms. Located in the West Bay district, geologists believe salt and lime deposits solidified the shells and skeletons of sea critters forming the pockmarked rockscape. You can't walk along the formation, but there are two platforms you can stand on for photo-taking. Hell got its name in the early 1930s, after a politician from England named Commissioner Cardinall tried to shoot a bird that was resting on the pointed black rocks. When he missed, he voiced his disappointment with a rather loud \"Oh Hell\" and the name stuck. Today, Hell is not only interesting to geologists and historians but also to tourists who stop by the Post Office to stamp a letter with the authentic Hell postmark and to meet and greet Ivan Farrington, resident island devil and owner of The Devil's Hangout Gift Shop . Sporting red horns on his head and carrying a black and red pitchfork, he likes to tell visitors that he's having \"one helluva day\" as he tosses his red cape over his shoulder.

Built in 1770, Rose Hall Plantation in Montego Bay was owned by John Palmer and his feisty British wife Annie. Her infamous black magic powers eventually led to John's demise and during her reign as mistress of the plantation, she reportedly did away with two more husbands and countless lovers. The so-called 'White Witch' was also allegedly quick with the whip; she was notorious for torturing her slaves in the dank dungeon. Believers will tell you her spirit still haunts the plantation house, which has been artfully restored with 18th-century furnishings. Daytime tours are offered from 9:15 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. but it's the candle–lit evening tours that start at 6:30 p.m. that are the creepiest. Informative guides take tour-goers through the plantation while recounting eerie tales about murder and mayhem guaranteed to elicit goosebumps from even the most skeptical. Keeping with the theme, the recommended rum cocktail in the dungeon tavern called Annie's Pub is the 'Witches Brew' that banishes the spirits of the ghosts that still flit about the mansion. Prices for both the day and night tour is USD$20 for adults and USD$10 for children (although if you're looking to avoid nightmares you may want to leave the kids with a babysitter back at the resort.)\nSaba\nEvery Halloween, the tiny island of Saba goes (literally) batty. (Photo: Marco Di Gianvito)\nEvery Halloween, the tiny island of Saba (population: 2,000 people on five square miles) across the sea from St. Maarten goes (literally) batty. As part of the month-long Sea & Learn program held every year in October, bat biologist Fernando Simal takes brave souls on his Batman Hike up to the summit of Mount Scenery which is, indeed, quite scenic. Along the way, hikers explore bat dwellings in the rainforest like caves, crannies and trees and using a black light, bats and luminescent scorpions are easy to spot. As part of the island's bat monitoring program, bat fanatics eavesdrop on the ultrasonic bat-speak of the winged critters while observing their curious nocturnal antics. Starting after dark, the Batman Hike is free and fun for kids who don't mind being scared or want to be a bat scientist (or Batman) when they grow up. For those who prefer their bat learning on level ground, grab a seat at the Sea Witch Bar and Grill in Windwardside for 'Bats in the Caribbean', where the resident bat biologist lets you in on the secret world of bats.\nTrinidad\nOn the southern slopes of the northern mountain range, it’s believed the ghost of Charles Joseph Count de Lopinot prowls his former home on stormy nights.

(Photo: Ian G. Holyoak, Nevis Tourism Authority)\nNo one has lived at Eden Browne for more than 150 years. On the eastern side of the small isle across the channel from St. Kitts, there is good reason the estate has been empty for so long. According to streetcorner lore, The Great House near Butlers Village is haunted by the ghosts of a groom and his best man who killed each other during a wedding in 1822. The bloody duel and the heartbreak that followed for the would-be bride happened on the exact same day that the property was to be christened as Garden of Eden at Browne's Estate. The arranged marriage between Caroline James Beard and John Higgins was intended to bring together two prosperous families but it didn't end happily ever after. Believers say the mayhem and murder led to a curse that still hangs around the dilapidated estate. Tourists who pass by the rundown estate get the willies knowing the ghost of the groom's forlorn fiancée still roams the house and her sobbing still heard in the dead of night.\nBarbados\nThe dead are anything but at rest in the cemetery of the Christ Church in the Barbados fishing village called Oistins. (Photo: visitbarbados.org)\nThe dead are anything but at rest in the cemetery of the Christ Church in the fishing village called Oistins. With more twists and turns than a Sherlock Holmes whodunit, legend has it each time the 19th-century Chase Vault with its two-foot thick coral and concrete walls was opened to bury another deceased family member, the coffins of Colonel Thomas Chase and his two young daughters mysteriously moved around, even after the crypt was sealed shut with a blue slab of marble at the entrance. When an investigation in 1820 offered no reasonable explanation for the moving coffins, they were buried in another location. The now-vacant vault still sits in the quiet church graveyard on the south coast and is the Halloween venue of choice for ghost hunters on a midnight stroll.\n4 CONNECT 22 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL
