(Photo: Instagram ) It all started with one simple note: “You’re already invited.” Flight attendant Taylor Tippett taped the note to the plane’s window to bring some good vibes to the passengers on the flight. She took a picture of it and posted it to her Instagram page and a movement was born. That was a year ago. Now Tippett has more than 120,000 followers on Instagram with her hashtag #wordsfromthewindowseat. Her story of posting positivity in the skies has gone global. She’s been featured in several news stories and was part of Discovery Channel’s “Seeker Stories” documentary . “I am overwhelmed with so much gratitude for the life I live and the story I get to tell,” Tippett recently wrote on her Instagram page. She also write a blog called “A Travelin’ Lady,” where you can find many of her inspirational notes.

The notes inspire and calm nervous fliers. (Photo: Instagram ) The notes kept coming, each one taped to the window. “Be the reason someone feels loved,” read one. “Do what matters,” said another. “If I’m not encouraging and inspiring others, what am I doing with my life?” she said. For my voice to matter and for other people to connect, to feel loved or just feel understood and heard,” she said. “That is all that matters to me.” Tippett says she’s careful not to disturb or even startle her passengers with the notes, so she usually posts them in the window, takes a picture and posts it to Instagram.

Tippett said she can’t believe how much her inspiring words have taken flight. “When I started #wordsfromthewindowseat almost a year ago, I never in my life could have imagined it would turn into what it has become today. I am overwhelmed. My little baby is growing and so many cool things are on the way. I couldn’t do it without y'all’s support and kind words. And I truly mean that.
