At a time where reports of rape are at the highest levels they have been for 10 years, where Operation Yewtree has helped to create a space for many women and men to begin to talk about the abuse they experienced in childhood, future funding for specialist sexual violence services like ours is still not secure. Over the past 30 years this is a situation that is sadly all too familiar. Our service has worked hard to cope throughout changing governments, being sure to keep our independence through grant-giving organisations who frequently recognise the value of our work. We have been supported, particularly in recent years, by the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and our local Police and Crime Commissioner. \"The Government has not confirmed our funding after March 2016, which means we can not expand our services to meet the increase in need.\" However, this is not the case for Rape Crisis Centres across the country and many survivors still don’t have access to a high-quality specialist sexual violence service in their local area. Our centre in South London also receives donations from the public and from clients who hold fundraisers, cake-sales and run marathons for us – all of which help us make sure that the women who access our services don’t suffer from the impact of indeterminate funding. But this is becoming increasingly difficult. We are experiencing a demand on all our services like never before. Our advocacy service which supports women and girls through the criminal justice process, had more referrals from the police in the first half of this year than they did for all of last year. Our outreach service which supports women and girls in prostitution and homelessness has seen the numbers of women accessing the service steadily increase since it was introduced two years ago. Most of them have experienced multiple forms of sexual violence by different perpetrators from childhood through to today. The impacts of the cuts to the NHS has meant that our counselling service which provides long-term high-quality therapy is struggling to cope with the number of referrals coming from mental health services - in one year, it's up 30 per cent. The Government has not confirmed our funding after March 2016, which means we can not expand our services to meet the increase in need. This means waiting times are getting to an unacceptable level, and more women are feeling further let down by a system that should be supporting them. We also run the National Rape Crisis helpline , open every day, speaking to over 5,000 women and girls every year who are coping with the impact of a crime someone else chose to commit. Some use different forms of self-injury to survive: cutting, banging their heads or hitting themselves. Some use suicidal ideation to get through the day. Some women try to keep so busy that they don’t have to think about what was done to them; others drink, use drugs and some control their food to try to get control back over their body. These are ways of staying alive, and are often hidden from loved ones, scared of being judged. They differ from person to person, however there is a common feeling across the women we speak to. Living in a society that still blames and stigmatises survivors rather than perpetrators means that for all of the women and girls who contact us there is a deep well of shame. It takes years for that shame to really dig in deep. It takes years to feel like you can talk to someone about it. And it takes long-term specialist support to build the safety needed for you to begin the work of excavating that shame. That support is under threat, right at the time it is needed the most. Here's hoping the Government makes the right decision come 2016. telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:33:22.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
