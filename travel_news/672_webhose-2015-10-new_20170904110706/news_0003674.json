Janet is an award-winning author, workshop facilitator, and speaker. Her innovative work explores the potential for conscious intentional communication to transform our world. Janet's unique practices, combining insights from ancient wisdom traditions, new thought, and psychology, offer tools for expanding awareness and enhancing social interactions. Janet envisions a world where everyone steps into their full human potential, does what they love, and joyfully gives their unique gifts to co-create a dynamic, abundant world, free of suffering. Forty-five years ago, Janet had a life-changing experience that inspired the conscious spiritual work she does today. In a moment of startling clarity, her consciousness suddenly shifted, and all the pieces of the human truth puzzle fell into place. She understood in that moment that we experience suffering simply because we are unaware of how our minds shape our experiences. The realization that we have a choice in how we perceive things was so empowering that Janet felt driven to share this knowledge with others. Janet went on to theorize that words structure our experiences, and since we all do it differently, we misunderstand and miscommunicate. Only when we learn how to speak clearly and listen attentively, can we work together to connect our needs and resources and solve mutual problems to benefit the entire community. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:34:32.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
