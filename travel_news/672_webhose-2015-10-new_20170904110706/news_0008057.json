As well, Regina Mayor Michael Fougere is set to make a cameo appearance as a hockey player in a \"faceoff against our concertmaster Simon McDonald,\" said Derksen. \nThe hall of fame is currently staging an exhibit on minor hockey in Saskatchewan. \n——— \nOnline: http://reginasymphony.com/concerts/upcoming", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:29:12.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
