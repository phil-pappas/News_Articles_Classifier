These Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, or INDCs, will be a pillar of the Paris agreement, due to enter into force in 2020.\nDeveloping nations were also up in arms about the lack of assurances on financial aid.\nRich countries have pledged to cough up $100 billion per year from 2020 to boost carbon reduction efforts and help vulnerable states brace for impacts ranging from drought and superstorms to food shortages.\nBut so far, the wording has remained vague on where the money will come from, the split between grants or loans, and how much will be earmarked for boosting resilience.\nThe new draft “completely ignored the submissions of G77 on finance,” said Gurdial Singh Nijar, a spokesman for the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group, which falls within the G77.\n‘The world is watching’ The five-day huddle in Bonn offers the last chance for rank-and-file negotiators to barter on the wording of the pact meant to crown more than two decades of fractious negotiations. The draft that emerges will be taken in hand by ministers and heads of state for the hard political compromises that will be required to seal a deal in Paris.\n“The whole world is watching us,” Peru’s Environment Minister Manuel Pulgar Vidal told negotiators.\n“The (Paris) agreement must launch the transformation of our economies toward a low carbon and resilient … society.”\nRather than revising the draft agreement, as scheduled, diplomats spent Monday re-submitting paragraphs and pages into the streamlined document, intended as a basis for political decision-makers in Paris.\nThe climate pact would be the first signed by all the world’s nations.\nThe global thermometer has already gone up by 0.8 C since the mid-19th century, and U.S. government scientists have said 2015 is likely to overtake 2014 as the hottest year on record.\nBased on emissions-curbing pledges so far, the planet is on course for warming of around 3 C, say analysts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:24:19.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
