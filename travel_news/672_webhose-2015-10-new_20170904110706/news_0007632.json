McCormick, GBTA Executive Director and COO.\n“The resulting actions demonstrate the high value that travel buyers place in the existing distribution network. The efforts by Lufthansa to fragment the distribution system by artificially adding cost is not working.”\nThe study also found that 93 per cent are “not considering” the option to book directly on Lufthansa’s site and 39 per cent are seeking alternative carriers.\nOnly 2 per cent of those surveyed said they would book directly with Lufthansa to avoid the fee.\n\nGBTA added the surcharge is a “direct price increase to managed travel programs with no corresponding benefit” and could “ultimately lead to decreased price transparency” if carried out by not only Lufthansa, but other airlines in the industry.\nThe online survey was conducted between October 14 and 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:17:40.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
