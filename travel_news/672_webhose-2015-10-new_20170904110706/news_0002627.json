Fiji has a lot to offer those who venture further into the islands. \nA short flight, or 2.5-hour boat ride from Denarau Island, you'll find the Yasawas - a chain of 20 volcanic islands. Each island boasts its own unique legend, white sandy beaches and great snorkelling spots and, being off the beaten track, they are also more peaceful than the main island. \nOn a recent family getaway, we visited Botaira Beach Resort and Barefoot Kuata Island. Keen to do more than just laze by the pool, we set out to experience the real Fiji. \nSNORKEL WITH THE SHARKS \nThe guided tour that left from Barefoot Kuata Island was an experiencethat people didn't believe back home. At least one school teacher thought my son Lachie was telling a \"porky\" about his shark story. I had to inform the teacher that, yes, I did in fact knowingly allow my kids to swim with sharks. But I then explained the sharks were of the white tip and black tip variety, which are only about 1.5 metres long. Their mouths are small and only nibble tiny fish, not human toes. These sharks are in the tropical, warm and shallow waters of the South Pacific in hidden spots. \nBarefoot Kuata Island has pristine white beaches, and water so clear that you can see bright-coloured fish and coral just a metre off the beach. The island also has fresh spring drinking water on tap in the eco-friendly bures and the place has just been refurbished with new pools and facilities. The unique and beautifully crafted wooden restaurant has no walls, just a roof, so you can feel the breeze as you eat. \nWhite sandy beaches set against a backdrop of lush green are a common sight in Fiji.

It's on top of one of thegiant rocks that a man in traditional Fijian garb dances when any guests arrive or depart. \nLocals lead daily walks to a summit nearby and tell stories about the island's ancestors and local medicinal plants.Or you can choose to just spend your days in a hammock on the beach if you prefer. \nBut it's hard to stay hammock-bound when this island's dive shop offers so many tempting activities. It was here that we booked the snorkelling with sharks trip. It's just a 15-minute boat ride to reach the spot where the sharks hang out. Ad Feedback \nMy sons Zach, 10, and Lachie, 8, loved seeing sharks outside of a Kelly Tarlton's aquarium. It's the kind of stuff boys dream of . We spent an hour wearing masks, snorkels and lifejackets and floating 4-6 metres above the sharks, fish and coral. We saw six sharks all up. A guide explained that the white tip sharks are generally inquisitive, while the black tip sharks are shy. My husband gloated later that a white tip brushed past an arm. The kids were so envious. \nThe trip has a 95 per cent success rate of sighting sharks. If you don't see them then you get another trip complimentary. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:27:56.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
