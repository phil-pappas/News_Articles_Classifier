I don't live in India but I visit Kolkata regularly. I have used regular yellow/black taxis for in-city and airport trips for decades (prepaid from the airport), and Megacab TO the airport more recently since they can be pre-booked late at night. However, the world is changing, and the latest thing is app-based services. The new services seem to have some potential advantages, for example Mega always seemed uninterested in doing short/medium trips, they only wanted to do airport runs. What I don't know is how Ola, Uber and TaxiForSure compare to each other for in-city trips (and also for airport trips). In particular, do they all have cabs ready to pick you up within a reasonable time, say 10 min? Even outside the central Kolkata area? (I might want one in, say, Jadavpur.) If they don't have a critical density of available cars throughout the metro area, then it isn't worthwhile to wait for them in preference to a regular taxi. Can one call these services from the airport? I read something about them being required to pay for airport parking in order to enter the terminal area, which is OK, I can pay that. Any other comments or comparisons of these services in Kolkata are appreciated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:32:41.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
