It’s called Mickey’s Halloween Party, the theme parks’ celebration of Halloween and increased ticket sales.\nDisneyland's 60th\nMickey's Halloween Party California Adventure: Best/worst rides Disneyland Diamond Celebration Disneyland Trivia PHOTOS: Celebration PHOTOS: Disneyland History Haunted Mansion's Hatbox Ghost Disney rock covers playlist New fireworks and shows Top 10 rides 5 worst rides For 17 nights between Sept. 25 and Oct. 31, the park kindly asks its daytime guests to depart by 6 p.m., devoting the park to ticket-holding masses who go from land to land in search of free treats.\nThe trick? Tickets are $77 (purchased on the same day) and many of the treats are of the healthy kind, including dried fruits and fruit hybrids (Craisins, anyone?).\nThe treat? The park is decked out in pumpkins, cornstalks and other signs of fall. Characters abound, each dressed in unique, Halloween-appropriate attire. Villains also are readily available for photos and autographs. These cheerily sullen characters will be happy to grimace for the camera. (Within the boundaries of Disneyland, evil definitely lacks its edge).\nAnd guests who dig through the dried fruits and grains will find ample bad-for-you treats, ones that will have four out of five dentists, and five out of five fitness gurus, wagging their fingers in shame.\nGuests will explore a haunted section of space as they escape the grips of galactic ghouls on Space Mountain Ghost Galaxy. (Photo: Paul Hiffmeyer/Disneyland)\nWhile a $77 ticket entitles you to as many treats as you can hold (more on that later), it most likely not be your key to the one thing most fans crave – short lines.\nThe evenings typically sell out days or weeks in advance (some tickets are held aside for guests staying on property, allowing them to purchase the day of the event). As a result, the park can be more crowded at night than during the day.\nDuring a visit in late October last year, lines for Space Mountain (re-themed Ghost Galaxy for Halloween) approached 90 minutes by 8 p.m. The night before, lines were in the 60-minute range, steadily lengthening after the parade and fireworks show.\nLong lines also were encountered at all the usual attractions, with particularly ghoulish waits at Haunted Mansion, boasting its annual “Nightmare Before Christmas” overlay.\nTurned out I was a naïve Mickey’s Halloween rookie. In speaking with several veterans of the event (I had a lot of time to kill), such crowds were normal. They noted several reasons for the event’s popularity, from the abundance of characters to dressing up in elaborate, and often flamboyant, costumes.\nMickey’s Halloween Party\nWhat: Disney characters drop by in unique costumes, and guests may help themselves to free treats, some of them fairly healthy.\nWhat: Disney characters drop by in unique costumes, and guests may help themselves to free treats, some of them fairly healthy.\nWhere: Disneyland.\nWhen: 17 nights: Friday, Sept. 25; Monday, Sept. 28, Wednesday, Sept. 30; Friday, Oct. 2; Monday, Oct. 5; Wednesday, Oct. 7; Friday, Oct. 9; Monday, Oct. 12; Wednesday, Oct. 14; Friday, Oct. 16; Monday, Oct. 19; Thursday, Oct. 22; Friday, Oct. 23; Sunday, Oct. 25; Tuesday, Oct. 27; and Thursday, Oct. 29.

He refused to elaborate.\nLess than an hour later, I knew exactly what he was talking about.\nShortly after the event began, cast members emerged from backstage in groups of four or five. Each rolled a pallet piled high with boxes, contents clearly labeled.\nSome guests fell in behind, as if being led by the Pied Piper. The more popular treats gathered a small parade, participants following the candy to its final destination where they waited for all to be unboxed at the treat stations set up around the park.\nAbout an hour into the treat giveaway I saw my first wagon, and pulled by none other than Captain Jack Sparrow, one of the flock of Sparrows I’d see (it was by far the most popular costume).Lines quickly formed between stanchions set up in front of each station. Whether dried fruit or fruit chews or chocolate, guests were there to scoop up anything offered.\nAnd how did the “Pirates of the Caribbean” captain scoop up snack-size candy?\nBy the “yarr”d.\nCast members doled out treats by the handful, but allowed others to grab as much as they could carry. As soon as one box emptied, another was there to take its place.\nThe Diamond Celebration continues as guests celebrate Halloween Time at Disneyland. (Photo: Paul Hiffmeyer/Disneyland)\nI saw few wagons, more the exception than the rule, but each was filled with Halloween booty. Perhaps the goal was to obtain enough treats to last to next Halloween. Or maybe the thinking was, “$77 a ticket, really? I’d say we’re even now, Disneyland.”\nBut even more remarkable than the greed shown by a tiny fraction of guests was this – as the night progressed, I didn’t see one empty wrapper, or bits of lightly chewed dried fruit that had been mistaken for something unhealthy and thus quickly discarded.\nEither guests were conscious of Disneyland’s epic cleanliness, or trash-eating nanobots were scouring the grounds. I’m going with the latter.\nMickey’s Halloween is a must for any Disneyland fan, and not just for the supply of candy so ridiculous that even four out of five grandmas would agree, “That’s more than enough.”\nYou’ll see and abundance of characters in unique costumes, providing ample photo opportunities. Many guests are just as creative, donning costumes worth an evening’s worth of selfies (no, I’m not counting you, Jack Sparrows).\nAs long as you’re prepared for the crowds, it’s a great once-in-October experience.\nAZCENTRAL\nKids Free Month in San Diego throughout October\nHere are tips I wish I knew last year:\n- Buy your tickets early. Most of the month’s events sell out (Halloween, for example, is already at capacity). Disneyland holds back a certain number of same-day tickets for guests staying on property (Disneyland Hotel, Grand Californian, Paradise Pier). If interested, check with the concierge. The earlier, the better.\n- Get your wristband early. Cast members set up wristband station 2-3 hours before the 6 p.m. event. Exchange your ticket for a wristband, which you’ll need to show to obtain candy and ride attractions.\n- No wristband or ticket? Wearing a long-sleeve shirt? You can probably get away with crashing the event, but no treats or rides for you. You’ll also feel very self-conscious, what with rudeness level of your behavior. And in Disneyland of all places.\n- Crowds are less hectic earlier in October and during the week. Still, while the $77 will buy you as many treats as you push, pull, tug or tow, it will not buy the serenity of a nearly empty theme park.\n- While Main Street offers the best view of the fireworks, you’ll find the second-best view, and far fewer people, in front of it’s a small world.\n- Don’t waste your time in treat lines during the first hour or two. Around 8 p.m., and then again after 10 p.m., most stations have little or no wait.\n- Disneyland officials refuse to divulge the kinds of candy distributed, nor the amounts, but during my visit last year the answers were “Mostly Grade B (fruit and chocolate chews, with scattered M&Ms and Twix,” and “Tons. Just tons.”\nAZCENTRAL\nMystery of Haunted Mansion's Hatbox Ghost solved\nMickey’s Halloween Party\nWhat: Disney characters drop by in unique costumes, and guests may help themselves to free treats, some of them fairly healthy.\nWhere: Disneyland.\nWhen: 17 nights: Friday, Sept. 25; Monday, Sept. 28, Wednesday, Sept. 30; Friday, Oct. 2; Monday, Oct. 5; Wednesday, Oct. 7; Friday, Oct. 9; Monday, Oct. 12; Wednesday, Oct. 14; Friday, Oct. 16; Monday, Oct. 19; Thursday, Oct. 22; Friday, Oct. 23; Sunday, Oct. 25; Tuesday, Oct. 27; and Thursday, Oct. 29.
