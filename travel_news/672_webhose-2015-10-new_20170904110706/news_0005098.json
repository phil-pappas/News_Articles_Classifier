And everyone who heads for the sun between now and April 8, 2016 can conveniently leave their winter coat or down jacket behind at the airport instead of carrying it to their holiday destination. For only about 50 euro cents per day and item, jackets and coats can be left where they are safe and secure: in the luggage storage facilities at Frankfurt Airport. The same low price also applies to longer trips. All that counts is the departure date. \nLuggage storage counters can be found at the following locations: \n• Terminal 1, Arrivals B, Level 1, open daily around the clock \n• Terminal 1, Departures B/C, Level 2, open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. \n• Terminal 2, ARrivals D, Level 2, open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. \nThe winter coat storage service is yet another element of Frankfurt Airport’s “Great to have you here!” service quality program launched by Fraport AG (the owner and manager of FRA) with the aim of continually enhancing the travel experience at Germany’s largest aviation hub. The Frankfurt Airport App 2.0 and free 24-hour Wi-Fi Internet access offered in the passenger terminals are just two examples of the successful services being offered under this program. More details about Frankfurt Airport’s wide range of services and facilities are available via FRA’s travel website and social media channels on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:55:58.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
