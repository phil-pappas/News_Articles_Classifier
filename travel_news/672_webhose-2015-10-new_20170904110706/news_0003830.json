I went out with friends to Leeds to watch it on the big screen. Our year 10 and 11 boys at Heckmondwike Grammar School were watching it round each other's houses. We were absolutely gutted. There has been huge support for Sam – and England – at Rugby World Cup 2015 , unprecedented interest from the kids, so everyone’s disappointed, but that’s not to take it away from Australia. I thought they were outstanding tactically. They were spot on. The talk of the staff room will now centre on the fact Sam didn’t start and only came on in the 61st minute. We were upset that Stuart Lancaster went for the more experienced look, as opposed to somebody with an abundance of energy and resilience. Sam was like a caged animal when he came out. He literally was like a beast Sam was like a caged animal when he came out. He literally was like a beast. That tackle that he made on the number seven… It was just upsetting that he didn’t really have much of a chance to have an impact on the game. That’s what all the kids will be chattering about in school. Mental strength I’ve sent a text message to Sam saying how proud we are of him at the school and that he’s done so well for himself. The thing with Sam is, he won’t need reassurance. His mother Julie and his brother Luke were at the game on Saturday. He won’t need that arm round him. He’ll be able to bounce back. He’s got that mental resilience from going through a lot of adversity and challenging things in his life. We mentioned in an earlier column how he had lost his dad to motor neurone disease at a young age. Whichever sort of battle he came up against, he would find a way to combat it – whether it was a game he was losing, or playing against older boys. He used to play up a year and two years. Boy star: young Sam He’d always find a way to win the game or get the better of an opponent. He’s found that in rugby union as well, having made the switch. That mental toughness has helped him combat that as well. I remember when Sam was in the Great Britain rugby league side that got to the semi-finals and lost at Wembley to Australia in the last minute, a number of teachers went to that game and spoke to him afterwards. No matter what the challenge is, for some reason, he is able to bounce back immediately. He’s the one who will grab the game by the scruff of its neck. He’ll say: “You know what, the most important game isn’t the last one, it’s the next one.” When we do our team talks at school we always emphasise that, and Sam Burgess is a great example of that. The most important pass, try or game is the next one. We can never affect what has happened in the past. We can only affect what happens in the future. What's next for Sam Burgess? He never ceases to surprise us. You can't guess what he'll come up with. He visits the school probably twice a year. He'll give us a phone call or send a message on Facebook whenever he's in the area and ask if it's ok to come in. Great example: Sam at school He'll spend maybe an hour and a half walking around the school, seeing the old teachers and spending time with the kids – taking photographs, signing pictures and so on. He'll come into the staff room and reminisce. So once things have settled down and the world cup has finished, I'm going to send him a message and see if he can come in and maybe do some sort of presentation. That would be good. To reach the rugby world cup is an unbelievable achievement. I hope he goes on and gets selected for the six nations and goes on to play in the Japan World Cup in 2019. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:22:15.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
