So in case not enough people come forward, I have been looking at other holidays that would suit somebody on their own.\n 2 Next From restaurant to runway: Hungry passengers can now order...

Sleep on a budget, enjoy the bustling nightlife and indulge... Half-term heaven: Children will love every action-packed... In complete contrast to Morocco, I like the idea of going to St Petersburg with One Traveller ( onetraveller.co.uk ), a travel company that specialises in what they call the ‘mature single traveller’ – those over 50, but mostly a bit older.\nChristmas in Russia, like other Orthodox countries, isn’t celebrated until January so, alas, you’ll miss out on their celebrations – but you can listen to a choir singing traditional Russian Christmas carols in your hotel together with a Christmas dinner, including caviar if you are not feeling too Scrooge-like.\nAnother benefit is that the museums and art galleries are far less busy than usual because there are fewer cruises around Christmas. The trip from December 22 to 27 costs £1,590pp.\nOther single operators also offer Christmas holidays in exotic locations. Friendship Travel ( friendshiptravel.com ), for example, has four nights in Marrakech for only £395, or how about turkey on the beach in Lanzarote for £1,325?\nNearer home Saga ( travel.saga.co.uk ) has a number of festive breaks in the UK, including a ‘boogie woogie Christmas’ with four jazz performances in Llanelli. The four-night trip on a full-board basis costs £689.\nA heritage hotel in Rajasthan, India, that has a pool and facilities for riding, yoga and cycling\nBut just because you are on your own doesn’t mean you have to go on a singles holiday – you can just as well go on a small group tour.\nResponsible Travel ( responsibletravel.com ) is a great website to trawl as it brings together small operators in one place.\nLetting my fingers do the walking, I found Christmas in Kenya with goat on the menu instead of turkey, at what sounds like a fairly raucous three-day celebration. It is part of a longer safari holiday in Kenya and Tanzania, which costs from £2,799.\nFor a more traditional offering, there’s four nights in Finland looking at the Northern Lights, for between £1,375 and £1,625pp.\nFor the more energetic, Wild Frontiers ( wildfrontiers.com ) offers a 14-day group tour taking in the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela and the Blue Nile Falls in Ethiopia, with a two-day trek between villages. The trip costs £,2,950, excluding flights.\nThe same company also has an alternative Christmas in Bijaipur in Rajasthan, based at a heritage hotel that has a pool and facilities for riding, yoga and cycling. It costs £2,125pp, plus £850 for flights if booked now. There’s no turkey on the menu but there is barbecued goat again.\nAlternatively, while others are stuffing themselves silly, you could go to a health retreat. Health and Fitness Travel ( healthandfitnesstravel.com ) has a range of holidays that sound far from spartan, including ‘seasonal stress relief’ in Thailand at Absolute Sanctuary for just over £2,000, or a Deep Sleep Digital detox in Italy for £2,870. Presumably iPads are banned and you’ll sleep through the entire festive season.\nIf you do want to get away, book early because flights in late December book up early.\nRead more: hidden moroccoto...
