So even though this job can be really demanding, I take great pleasure in protecting them from harm. It gives me profound satisfaction to see an animal enjoying a new lease of life. Take the dog I rescued the other week, a spaniel cross. She was emaciated, with skin and dental issues, but now she’s living the life of Riley with a family who own a smallholding, so she has free run of the yard and acts like a puppy again. We’ve nicknamed her “Princess” – because she gets treated like one. It’s the variety of animals we deal with that makes my work so interesting – I could be treating an injured bird one minute, dealing with an abused cat the next, then spending an hour searching for a lost snake. And I will do whatever it takes to keep animals safe from harm. You could see me going out in all weathers or in the middle of the night to investigate, collect or rescue an animal in danger, whether it’s a swan, a badger or a bat. The priority is to get them safely to the appropriate facility. It’s a great feeling, to protect such beautiful animals. The RSPCA relies on the generosity of its supporters to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome many thousands of animals As a canine-focused officer, I have a particular brief to help stop illegal puppy traders. It is hard work, because criminals trade in dogs in the way some people deal drugs. They are making a lot of money and causing a lot of harm. For owners, it is heartbreaking to get a puppy and discover it is unwell. But that is so often the case with dogs in the puppy trade, because of issues like inbreeding and poor care. It is awful for the owners and even worse for the dogs. No animal should have to suffer like that. The RSPCA relies on the generosity of its supporters to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome many thousands of animals. If you would like to make a difference and help ensure animals continue to be rescued, you could consider remembering the charity with a gift in your will. Gifts in wills fund more than half the charity’s work, and it’s a great way to help protect vulnerable animals for many generations to come. Keeping animals safe For Pauline and Cliff Ride, giving to the RSPCA feels like the natural thing to do. Like Caroline Doe, their daughter Jenny is an inspector for the charity, so they know at first-hand its impact on animals of every shape and size. “Jenny has been an RSPCA Inspector for 16 years,” explains Mrs Ride, “and we’re very proud of the work she does. She and her colleagues put in long hours, and they have a tough job. But like everyone involved in the organisation, they do so uncomplainingly, because they simply adore animals.” Mr and Mrs Ride, who rescued a dog from the RSPCA nine years ago, have no doubt that the charity uses its funds responsibly. “Not a penny is wasted,” says Mrs Ride, “which is why we’ve decided to leave them a gift in our will. We want the RSPCA to continue caring for animals, educating people about welfare issues, and bringing those who commit cruelty to justice. For us, it feels like an especially fitting gift to leave behind.” Find out more about how you can leave a gift in your will to the RSPCA here or call 0300 123 0239 The RSPCA helps animals in England and Wales.
