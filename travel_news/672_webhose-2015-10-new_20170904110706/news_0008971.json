Story highlights A menu from the last first class lunch served aboard the Titanic has sold for $88,000 It was saved by a first-class passenger who escaped on the \"Money Boat\" Dishes served included smoked sardines, galantine of chicken and custard pudding (CNN) An original menu from the last first-class lunch served aboard the ill-fated Titanic has sold for $88,000 to a private collector at an online auction. The luncheon menu had been saved by a first-class passenger, Abraham Lincoln Salomon, one of only a handful of people who climbed aboard a lifeboat called the \"Money Boat\" or \"Millionaires' Boat\" when the main ship started sinking into the icy waters of the Atlantic. The lifeboat gained its moniker because the wealthy passengers it saved purportedly bribed the crew to row away from the disaster rather than rescue more people.
