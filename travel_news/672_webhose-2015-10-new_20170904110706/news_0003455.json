For many destinations across the globe, the cheapest time to book hotels is in the beginning of the year. Average room rates during the first two weeks of January were below average in 22 of the 25 markets the study looked at. Though most travelers don’t think of September and October as high season, those months are often the most expensive months for hotel rooms.\n \nWhen to find bargains depends on where you are traveling. Mid-March is a great time to visit Europe, as hotel rooms in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Amsterdam, Barcelona, Stockholm and London are as much as 20% cheaper than average. July is considered high season in many destinations, but hotel rooms in Sydney and New York are actually cheaper than average then. The last week in December, also considered high season in most destinations, is also a great time to travel to Stockholm.\n \nHow much can you save? Price variations from month to month can be significant. On average, a hotel room in Berlin, for example, costs 51% more in September compared to January. Visit Barcelona in January and you’ll save 49% off the average room price. November through February, Istanbul hotels are about 23% cheaper than average. In June, they’re 21% more expensive.\n \n“For many travelers, price is the most important factor in deciding when and where to go. This data can help our customers get the most out of their money,” said John Brown, Chief Operating Officer of Agoda.com.\n \nSource:-Agoda.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:19:49.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
