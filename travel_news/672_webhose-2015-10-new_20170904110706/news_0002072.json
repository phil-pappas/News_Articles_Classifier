Now, he works as a pundit and commentator, calling on his professional experience and the understanding that comes with a lifetime lived in the sport. But in developing his business, SuperSkills Experiences, he has had to start from scratch. He will speak about making that transition – achieving the ultimate in one game and beginning afresh in another, the ambition that drove him to do so, and how his strategy was informed by his prior experiences. Together with a panel, he’ll be encouraging the audience to consider where their businesses came from, where they are going, and what will be required of everyone to get there.
