Related Content \n\"Visual disturbances\" are just the beginning of the fright fests these five Halloween attractions are creating for fall thrill-seekers. \nErebus Haunted Attraction, Pontiac, Michigan \nThe disclaimer for the four-story Erebus haunted attraction hints at the horrors that lie in wait: \"You will experience audio & visual disturbances, low visibility, strobe lights, fog, damp and/or wet conditions, encounter uneven walking surfaces in a physically demanding environment.\" \nAnd yes, it will be scary. There are emergency exits throughout the horror emporium in Pontiac, Michigan, but be warned that there are no refunds or re-entry. \nGeneral weekend admission is $28. Prices fall by a few dollars from Sunday through Thursday. hauntedpontiac.com \nBates Motel and Haunted Hayride, Glen Mills, Pennsylvania \nA drive-through insane asylum, \"more pyrotechnics than a KISS concert\" and 75 actors dressed to thrill are just part of the 25-minute Haunted Hayride at Arasapha Farm, outside Philadelphia in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania. \nThe same ghoulish property is also home to the Bates Motel haunted house, with animatronic props and \"floor boards that come alive,\" as well as a Haunted Corn Trail. \nCombo tickets are $40 for adults, $35 for kids and include admission to the hayride, the Bates Motel and the haunted trail. Tickets to individual attractions are also available. thebatesmotel.com \nThe 13th Gate, Baton Rouge, Louisiana \nBaton Rouge, Louisiana's, 13th Gate includes a snake-infested Louisiana Swamp, hidden subterranean passages and a prehistoric ice cave. Your goal is \"to be a survivor, not a victim, of the house,\" which features 13 terrifying realms. \nAcross the street at Necropolis 13, you'll have to dodge the living dead on a walk across a New Orleans-style cemetery. There's a voodoo fire show at the cemetery on Friday and Saturday nights. \nGeneral admission tickets to 13th Gate are $25. Necropolis 13 general admission is $20. A combo ticket for both is $35. midnightproduction.com \nHaunted Overload, Lee, New Hampshire \nDuring much of the year, DeMeritt Hill Farm masquerades as a family farm where visitors can pick fruit and vegetables. In mid-October, Haunted Overload is unmasked. \nEnormous monsters are among elements that make the attraction's nighttime haunts terrifying. For those with little stomach for the full horror, the \"Day Haunt\" or \"Fright Night Lite\" experiences offer the same elaborate sets, but the actors won't try to scare you. \nMain event night tickets are $24. Lite night tickets are $12.50. Day visits are $5. (Prices quoted are for online purchases. Add $5 to price for walk-in purchases.) Warning: People with certain health conditions, which are listed before online purchases can be made, are prohibited from entering. hauntedoverload.com \nNetherworld, Atlanta \n\"The Rotting\" is Netherworld's main event. The appetizing haunt tells the story of witches and evil spirits that feed off the life force of human beings, causing their bodies to decay and become gripped with hunger. New experiences within \"The Rotting\" include the Alien Flesh Lab, the Slithering Soul Eater and the Rotting Dead. \nA second haunted attraction, \"Vault 13: Unearthed,\" is a classified decommissioned military base built to house dangerous materials, which was reactivated three months ago -- but by forces outside the U.S. military chain of command. \nPrices vary from $22 for one weeknight show to $50 for a SpeedPass that gets passholders to the front of the line for both attractions on certain nights. fearworld.com \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
