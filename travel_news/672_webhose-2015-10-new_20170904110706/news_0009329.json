A plaque in honor of Mildred and Patty Hill, composers of \"Happy Birthday To You\" stands next to a parking lot in Louisville, Kentucky. (Gunnar Johnson) Story, photosGunnar Johnson South Florida Sun-Sentinel \nYou may have heard the news about how the \"Happy Birthday To You\" tune has been declared in the public domain after a federal judge found in favor of some filmmakers suing Warner/Chappell music publishers, who bought the copyright to the song for millions back in 1988. \nWhat you might not know is next to an overpass of Interstate 64 and attached to a parking lot in Louisville, Ky., sits a plaque in honor of the two local kindergarten-teaching sisters who composed the \"Happy Birthday To You\" song. Patty and Mildred Hill wrote a tune in 1893 called \"Good Morning to All\" that was easy for their young students to sing. It had the melody of what later became \"Happy Birthday To You,\" which first appeared as a song in print in 1912. According to the plaque, Lisette Hast, a child having a birthday party at the Little Loomhouse on Kenwood Hill in Louisville, was the first person to have the song sung in her honor. The plaque goes on to say the tune is among the three most popular in the English language. \nIn 1988, Warner/Chappell purchased the company that owned the copyright and charged thousands of dollars for each use of the song in movies, TV and recordings, or when performed live commercially. This explains why the waitstaff at TGIFridays doesn't embarrass you with the \"Happy Birthday To You\" song on your special day but uses some other tune, like Yankee Doodle, with suitably mortifying birthday lyrics instead. \nIt's unclear why the Hills' plaque was placed in such an odd spot. There doesn't seem to be much foot traffic, and cars driving by will never notice it if they don't know its there already. There's a plan in the works to honor the Hills in a more grandiose way, however. Fans are seeking donations for a Happy Birthday Park, to be located on Fourth Street near Chestnut in Louisville. They think $200,000 should get the job done. \nSo the next time you're being feted by your friends and loved ones with the world's longest song when it's in your honor and you've got nowhere to look but the cake, remember the Hill sisters of Louisville. How old are you now? \nThe \"Happy Birthday To You\" plaque is located on the south side of West Main Street, west of North Ninth Street and near the entrance ramp to Interstate 64 in Louisville, Ky. \nGunnar Johnson, a Sun Sentinel designer, is the author of Eccentric Roadside, www.eccentricroadside.blogspot.com , a travel blog featuring unusual roadside sights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:05:41.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
