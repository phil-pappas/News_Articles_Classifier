Estimated profits are also being downgraded. \nTourists also appear cautious as countries, including the United States, are warning travellers that Myanmar might be unstable during the election period. \nDirector Myo Win Nyunt from the ministry said: “The numbers increased compared to last year but most of them are coming through the borders, not the airport.” \nOne million tourists arrived by air and over two million came from border gates which meant a total of 3.37 million tourist had visited by the end of September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:52:42.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
