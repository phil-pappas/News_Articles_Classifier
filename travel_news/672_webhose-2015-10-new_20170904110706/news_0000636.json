Profits are forecast to fall by about a quarter to £1.4bn when the FTSE 100 pharmaceutical giant reports its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, despite an 8pc increase in sales to more than £6bn. GSK has already flagged up dwindling revenues from its Advair asthma drug, which is suffering from competition from cheaper generic rivals. The firm hopes to launch a new drug to treat asthma named Nucala next year to boost its respiratory arm , having seen disappointing clinical results from Breo, another asthma drug. GSK has also tried to revive its fortunes by swapping its cancer drugs for a vaccines business and more consumer health products in a complex deal with its Swiss competitor Novartis. Glaxo boss Andrew Witty took a pay cut after a rough 2014 Photo: PA The results are released a week before the firm holds its first investor day focused on research and development in a decade. The firm could use the event to give shareholders a glimpse of where its priorities lie among its portfolio of HIV treatments, vaccines and cancer drugs. Glaxo has spent £17bn on research and development in the four years to 2014, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, who have questioned the need to spend a similar amount in future. Shares in GSK have fallen 3pc in the past year and now stand at £13.69, giving it a market value of £66.8bn. The company's turnaround efforts come at a time of enormous mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry. telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:30:13.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
