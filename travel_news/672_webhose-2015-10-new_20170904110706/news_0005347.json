In fact, the business owners who should read this likely won't, because they will never know about it. \nA few weeks ago I went to meet with a potential client. During our meeting, I discussed growth strategy options for their company. This firm I am referring to has been in business for over four decades and has thousands of clients, but there is a problem: The vast majority of their clients were over 70 years of age. \nWhile they are currently generating a solid stream of revenue, what will happen after their current client base begins to disappear? What about the younger generations? \n\"We don't do need any more business, and we do not use social media.\" Those words have been spoken to me more than one time from the mouth of a small business owner. \nListen, after working for someone else for the majority of my adult life, I took a risk and started my own business. It began as a ton of freelance work, but it became much larger. It's amazing what happens when you help others reach their goals and show businesses how to increase their profits and revenue, suddenly, everyone wants to talk to you. \nSocial media has played a key role for me, for my initial launch, for networking, connecting, building relationships, and for learning. I have been mentored by people I have never met and likely will never meet. I have clients who I will likely never see. It is amazing what we have access to now. It is so much more than just \"the Internet.\" Should we thank Al Gore or what? He did claim to have invented the Internet, right? \nBusiness owners everywhere dive off into a world of panic and hysteria when someone asks them if they are on social media. Have you ever wondered why this is the case? Social media is not going away. Period. We better master it now and reap the benefits before it is too late. Let's face it, I would have made my leap from traditional employment to full-time entrepreneurship ten years ago if I had known what I know now. The problem? I wouldn't have had the access to learn what I know now ten years ago. \nIf you are a small business owner and social media is not something you are utilizing to reach a new customer base, interact with your current customers, or promote your products and/or services, please listen to what I am about to tell you: Get. Started. Now. Here is the deal. Even if you have no clue what to do with social media, there are tons of resources out there to help you. There are companies who will actually manage your social media accounts for you. \nThis is just a scratch on the surface, though. I can tell you this: If I meet with a business who wants to increase their revenue and profits, and they have no social media presence, that is one of, if not the, first item on the agenda to address. \nFind your customers. Maybe your only customer base has been local to where you reside. Maybe you have an untapped market well outside of your local market. Don't you believe it is time to make sure you have a solid plan in place and integrate social media with your business growth plans of the future? \nWhat is the number one reason for social media integration with your business's strategy? Relationships. People will develop a sense of connectedness and will likely spend their money with you. \nFollow Adam Davis on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Adamdaviswriter More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:04:50.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
