However, it also brought about terrible ecological disasters to the environment. The sky is no longer blue, and the water is no longer green. Human beings have realized that how important it is to protect the environment. Moben Global Inc, a creative enterprise, rolled out several series of Fosjoas self-balancing intelligent scooters. There are unicycles, twin-wheeled scooters, 2-wheeled scooters and sitting-posture scooters. Fosjoas electric scooters are all driven by the green resource, electricity. So there is no harm to the environment. What’s more, Fosjoas designers use the original Sony/Panasonic lithium batteries in producing Fosjoas models. The famous lithium batteries are greener, safer, and more non-toxic than ordinary batteries. With full charge, the scooters can work at most 23 kilometers. The lifetime of lithium battery is 3 times than ordinary ones’, while the usage time is 2.9 times than them. Instead of driving or taking public vehicles, more and more citizens choose Fosjoas self-balancing electric scooters as their private vehicles. The new lifestyle helps protect the environment and makes people’s life healthier. About: Fosjoas Technology Co.,Ltd was founded by UK Moben Global Inc. in 2010.
