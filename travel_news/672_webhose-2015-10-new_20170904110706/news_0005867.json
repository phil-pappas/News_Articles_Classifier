The artists, who are members of the SeyLar Federation, have hosted their first exhibition in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism and Culture and the National Arts Council. \nThe exhibition was officially launched on Friday afternoon at the National Arts Gallery located at the National Cultural Centre by the Minister for Tourism and Culture, Alain St.Ange in the presence of the Principal Secretary for culture, Benjamine Rose; Chief Executive of the National Arts Council, Jimmy Savy; French and Chinese Ambassadors; members of the SeyLar Federation; and other artists. \nSpeaking at the official opening of the exhibition, Minister St.Ange said it is important to understand and recognize that art forms part of the country’s culture, adding that such exhibitions have always added a special touch to its Festival Kreol. \nSeychelles has always emphasized that the country’s Creole identity must be marked and valued, and this is surely done through the Festival Kreol, which is this year being organized for the 30th time. \n“If there is one thing that truly belongs to us, it is our unique culture. And as we have made Creole one of our official languages, we have also given the arts of Seychelles their rightful place in our culture,” he said. \nMinister St.Ange saluted the 26 artists who have come forward with their art works to feature in this exhibition, and congratulated the SeyLar Federation for such an initiative in hosting their first exhibition during this year’s Festival Kreol. \nHe also spoke about the efforts being put to give the country its national arts collection, which he said will be a vital tool which will help in the promotion of Seychelles’ culture to the future generation. \nMinister St.Ange announced that later this week, a day prior to the official opening of the Festival Kreol 2015, a foundation stone laying ceremony will be held at the site where the new music stadium will be built at English River, minutes away from the capital of Victoria. \nAlso addressing the guests at the opening of the exhibition, SeyLar’s Chairperson, Danny Sopha, said the federation aims to promote the works of the visual artists of Seychelles in a way that this vital aspect of Seychelles’ culture remains solid. \nMr. Sopha added that the works on display in this exhibition reflect the value of the country’s Creole identity. \nThe SeyLar members were also congratulated by Mr. Savy who reaffirmed the National Arts Council’s support towards the federation and all artists. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
