Connectivity is key to ensure that British companies have a level playing field when trying to compete beyond our borders,” he added.\nThe GTMC analysed over 10,000 flight bookings for travellers flying on business made by member Travel Management Companies (TMCs) in the first half of 2015 to 22 cities around the world.\nWait, presented the findings at a fringe event taking place as part of the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.\nThe data shows that for cities such as Jakarta, Lima, Manila, Panama City and Taipei there is a “huge demand for business travel not being met”.\nThousands of business trips are being made to these destinations from the UK but they are being made mostly via European or Middle Eastern hub airports (such as Dubai) which, in the long term is damaging for ‘UK Plc’, the GTMC said.\nAccording to Oxford Economics 2015 report into the worlds’ fastest growing cities, Jakarta is predicted to grow by 6.1 per cent in the coming years. In the first half of 2015 only 5 per cent of business travel trips to Jakarta were on direct chartered flights, leaving 95 per cent of business travellers from the UK wanting to work in Jakarta without a choice but to travel indirectly.\nTable below shows the percentage of direct and in-direct flights made to each destination between January and June 2015.\nDestination\nDirect flights (%)\nIndirect flights (%)\nBeijing\n51\n49\nBogota\n29\n71\nBuenos Aires\n55\n45\nBusan\n3\n97\nChengdu\n35\n65\nDalian\n0\n100\nDelhi\n74\n26\nGuangzhou\n23\n77\nJakarta\n5\n95\nKuala Lumpur\n37\n63\nLima\n0.5\n99.5\nManila\n18\n82\nMumbai\n73\n27\nMuscat\n59\n41\nPanama City\n25\n75\nQingdao\n0\n100\nRio de Janeiro\n54\n46\nSantiago\n7\n93\nSao Paulo\n74\n26\nShanghai\n15\n85\nShenzhen\n0\n100\nTaipei\n11\n89", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:33:55.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
