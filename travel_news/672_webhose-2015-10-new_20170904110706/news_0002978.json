This partnership provides the student body, faculty and staff at Hanover College , as well as residents of Hanover , with a sustainable transportation option to travel around their community. In one cost-effective package, UhaulCarShare gives members the freedom a car provides without the financial burden.\nHanover College is committed to doing its part to protect the environment, and the Scion helps the college reduce its carbon footprint. The vehicle is available every hour of every day. An eco-friendly form of transportation, each UhaulCarShare vehicle takes up to 20 personally-owned vehicles off the road, reduces parking congestion and improves air quality.\n\"The UhaulCareShare program is a good fit for Hanover College because it gives people easy access to transportation,\" said Rhonda Burch , Senior Director of Communications and Marketing at Hanover College . \"With the college's location between three major cities ( Louisville , Cincinnati and Indianapolis ), it will allow students, faculty and staff to take advantage of all those areas have to offer, as well as take care of any needs in the local community, all at an affordable price.\"\nUhaulCarShare has a unique yet flexible rate system that allows individuals 18 and older to enjoy all the benefits of driving without having to worry about overpaying for mileage. With no start-up application fee or annual-membership dues, drivers pay only for what they use. Vehicles can be reserved on the spot for as little as an hour or for up to three days. With guaranteed lowest pricing, the Scion can be reserved at $4.95 per hour plus mileage or $62 per day. For those who drive longer distances, UhaulCarShare offers a capped rate which includes 180 free miles.\n\"UhaulCarShare is a valuable and practical way to make transportation available to those in need in one convenient package,\" said Mariah Reid, UhaulCarShare program director. \"In addition, the service provides peace of mind of knowing that insurance, maintenance, reserved parking spots and 24/7 roadside assistance are included in the rates.\"\nAbout UhaulCarShare\nContact:\nAndrea Batchelor\nJeff Lockridge\nEmail: publicrelations@uhaul.com\nPhone: 602-263-6194\nWebsite: uhaul.com\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uhaulcarshare-convenience-comes-to-hanover-college-300159036.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA27222&Transmission_Id=201510140905PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA27222&DateId=20151014", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://new.uhaulcarshare.com/home/howitworks", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "https://uhaulcarshare.com/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=pressrelease&utm_medium=news", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/uhaulcarshare-convenience-comes-to-hanover-college-300159036.html", "http://www.uhaul.com/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=pressrelease&utm_medium=news"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:20:52.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
