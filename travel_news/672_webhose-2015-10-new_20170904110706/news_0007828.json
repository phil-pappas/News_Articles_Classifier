The event is scheduled to be held from April 25-28, 2016 at the Dubai World Trade Centre in Dubai, UAE. \nSaid eTN publisher Juergen T. Steinmetz: “ATM has developed to be the most important travel and tourism event in the Middle East Gulf region - one of the most active and expanding areas in the world for the travel, tourism, and the MICE industry. eTN is proud to be a partner with ATM recognizing the importance of the United Arab Emirates as a global venue. In fact, eTN’s readers in the Gulf region are among the fastest-growing and most active segment.” \nATM is one of the industry’s growing knowledge platforms, providing global trends, innovations, research, insight, and topical debate. Last year, more than 4,000 delegates attended over 55 seminars. Over 2,800 exhibitors from around the world represented every sector of the travel industry. It is expected that there will be more than 36,000 travel professionals at this must-attend event in 2016, bringing together industry professionals from every region and sector. \n“As a leading global event for the travel industry, ATM is a unique opportunity for the whole global travel trade to meet, network, negotiate, and conduct business under one roof. eTurboNews with its global subscriber base of 230,000 and the potential reach of 1.3 million, including 17,000 journalists is the ideal media outlet for ATM. Our publications are produced as soon as the news comes out,” Steinmetz added. \nThe main objective for the majority of exhibitors and visitors at ATM is to conduct business with people they would not usually get the opportunity to meet. ATM is a truly international event serving the Middle East travel industry. And if reviews from the attendees and participants is any indication, then ATM is doing everything right. \nHadeer El Refaie from Far East Honeymoons said of last year’s event, “Attending Arabian Travel Market means that I don't have to travel all over the world to meet suppliers from different countries – at ATM I was able to meet vendors and suppliers that are important to my business all under one roof.” Omer Masood from National Air Express Travel Services (Pvt) Ltd. shared: “Arabian Travel Market was amazing - I learned a lot and had the opportunity to put a face to names that I have been in contact with for years. Most importantly, it drove me to excel and create a plan to increase the range of services offered by my business.” Oct 22, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:24:51.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
