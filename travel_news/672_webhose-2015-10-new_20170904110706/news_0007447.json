Organise your own footy trip away with partners, family and friends and get up close and personal with all the high-flying action. \nThe fun and entertainment don't end at the final siren, though. \nThe premiership party is a post-match celebration from 6pm featuring the AFL Grand Final Day artists and the presentation of the AFL premiers to the crowd. \nFor those who can't get enough footy, relive all your own glory days or simply have a kick-a-round on the hallowed turf with your mates and little tackers when the MCG opens its doors to the public on the Sunday - the day after the big game. afl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:05:46.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
