We were 88 miles from France’s Champagne region, on the English side of the Channel, in a two-pub village called Ditchling, in East Sussex. Here lies Ridgeview Estate ( ridgeview.co.uk ), which took the top prize for bubbly at the 2010 Decanter World Wine Awards (DWWA), never before given to a producer outside France. This was no anomaly. Increasingly, English sparkling wines have been racking up international awards, and like Ridgeview, many hail from the South Downs. With the same chalky soil as Champagne’s Côte des Blancs — geologically linked by the Paris Basin, which runs under the English Channel — the rolling grassland, ancient woodland and white cliffs between Hampshire and Sussex counties in southeast England encompass not only part of Britain’s newest national park, but also a burgeoning wine region. And rising temperatures have been working in its favor. Photo Chardonnay grapes at the Ridgeview Estate in Ditchling, East Sussex.

Hence Mark and Sarah Driver (a former hedge fund owner and a former lawyer turned fine-wine enthusiasts, husband and wife) bought 600 acres in a valley between Alfriston village and the East Sussex coast and started planting vines. Their Rathfinny Estate ( rathfinnyestate.com ) recently opened as England’s largest vineyard. With their Moët & Chandon–trained winemaker, the Drivers plan to produce one million bottles of “world-class” sparkling wine annually (last year, all of Britain released about 4 million) while creating a sustainable, state-of-the-art hub for English wine tourism. From the Rathfinny Trail (a new public footpath that cuts through the valley) to the Flint Barns (the estate’s formerly derelict farmhouse, just opened as an old-meets-new B&B and cafe), it’s a bit of an “If you build it, they will come” scenario.

Credit Andy Haslam for The New York Times A three-hour tour (from £35, about $53 at $1.50 to the pound) took me through poppy-strewn rows of GPS-planted Champagne clones, hand-pruned around steel posts, to the local oak–clad winery. Afternoon tea was served in its tasting room, done up by the Soho House designer Susie Atkinson — though you’ll have to wait until 2017 to try Rathfinny’s sparkling wine. The Drivers are already applying for Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status, however, to create a standard and a name for Sussex-made bubblies — à la “Champagne.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:27:28.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
