The residence was named one of the most important houses of the twentieth century in a 1957 survey of \"Architectural Record\" readers, along with Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House and Philip Johnson's Glass House.\nSarasota Architectural Foundation funded the replica's concept, engineering and construction through private donations. The structure was built using Rudolph's original plans and is furnished as the original house was in 1953. The furnishings and their placement are based on highly detailed interior images taken by legendary architectural photographer Ezra Stoller . Guests will be able to sit on a Rudolph-designed daybed, flip through the pages of period magazines and view kitchen cabinets filled with vintage dinnerware.\nA complementary exhibition of photographs, models, drawings and writings at The Ringling, Paul Rudolph : The Guest Houses , will be open until December 6 .\nTickets to SarasotaMOD Weekend events, including the Opening Night Party at the Walker Guest House Replica and other parties, presentations and tours are now available at SarasotaMOD.com. Ticket availability is limited, and visitors are encouraged to purchase theirs soon.\nEvents throughout the three-day weekend will be held in spectacular spaces rarely open to the public, including Rudolph's renowned 1953 Umbrella House and his newly-renovated 1960 addition at Sarasota High School.\nSarasotaMOD is presented by the Sarasota Architectural Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to celebrating the Sarasota School of Architecture movement, in partnership with The Ringling and the Paul Rudolph Foundation.
