Updated 1208 GMT (1908 HKT) October 22, 2015 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 101. Baghdad (Iraq) – Research and advisory firm Reputation Institute has released its latest City RepTrak report. It surveyed 19,000 people, asking them to rate 101 cities around the world by their reputations. Baghdad, the capital city of Iraq, came last. Hide Caption 1 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 100. Tehran (Iran) – Iran's capital city Tehran fared slightly better than Baghdad, ranking 100th. The two capitals were the only cities on the list to score lower than 40, placing them in the \"cities with a poor reputation\" category. Hide Caption 2 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 99. Moscow (Russia) – With 47.1 points, Moscow is the third least reputable city in the world according to the study. The Reputation Institute said Russia suffers from a \"negative halo.\" This means that \"although international observers are able to recognize the great reality of the country and its cities, they are still reluctant to love it,\" said Fernando Prado, managing partner at the Reputation Institute. The U.S. and China have a similar problem. Hide Caption 3 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 98. Nairobi (Kenya) – The Kenyan capital of Nairobi ranks 98th on the City RepTrak report, coming in with a score of 47.5. Hide Caption 4 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 97. Bogota (Colombia) – With an estimated 8 million inhabitants, Bogota is 97th on the list. But it's also one of several cities that saw big improvements over 2014. Bogota's 2015 reputation score rose 10.5%. Hide Caption 5 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 5. Vancouver (Canada) – Moving to the top of the table, Vancouver took fifth place on the reputation list. It's the only North American city to crack the top 10. Hide Caption 6 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 4. Vienna (Austria) – Named by Mercer's as the city with the best quality of living in 2015, Vienna scored well in the reputation study as well. There's a strong correlation between the livability rating of a city and its reputation, according to the report. Hide Caption 7 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 3. Stockholm (Sweden) – Seven out of the top 10 cities on the list are in Europe. Stockholm ranked the highest among European cities, taking third place. Hide Caption 8 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 2. Melbourne (Australia) – Given that Melbourne was crowned the world's most liveable city by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) for five consecutive years, it should come as no surprise that it's considered the world's second most reputable city. Hide Caption 9 of 10 10 photos: Cities with the world's best and worst reputations 1. Sydney (Australia) – And the city with the best reputation in the world is Sydney -- land of iconic buildings, Hugh Jackman and this beautiful skyline. Hide Caption Story highlights More than 19,000 people were surveyed to rank 101 cities by their global reputation Europe dominated the top 10 list but Sydney snatched the title as most reputable city in the world Tehran and Baghdad were found to have the worst reputations (CNN) Australia, give yourself a pat on the back. Sydney and Melbourne are the two most reputable cities in the world, according to the latest study by the Reputation Institute . The 2015 City RepTrak study surveyed more than 19,000 residents of G8 countries -- France, Germany, Italy, UK, Japan, U.S., Canada and Russia. Respondents were asked to rate the world's 101 best cities based on their levels of trust, esteem, admiration and respect. \"We see linkages with other research when we compare our reputation rankings to data like tourism and investment,\" said Fernando Prado, managing partner at the Reputation Institute. Read More \"The measures end up being strongly correlated.\" For a city, a strong reputation is closely linked to a desire by individuals to visit, live, work or invest there, he said. \"This is a bottom-line issue for local policymakers,\" added Prado. \"Cities with a good reputation welcome more tourists, host relevant events and attract more investment and talent.\" Europe has most reputable cities -- and one of the least Aside from the first two spots, Vancouver (no.5) is the only other non-European city in the top 10. In fact Europe dominated the top of the list --15 of the top 20 cities are from the region. Bumped off the top 10 list in 2014, Stockholm bounced back into third place this year. Last year's champion, Vienna is the fourth most respected city in 2015. Iran's capital city Tehran and Iraq's capital Baghdad, with scores of 35.4 and 31.4 respectively, came in last. They're the only two cities to receive a \"poor reputation\" rating --- meaning their score was lower than 40. Moscow, found to have a \"weak reputation,\" was named the third least reputable city in the world. Asian cities' score low but are improving Tokyo (no.12), the city with the biggest population and highest GDP among the cities surveyed, is the most highly regarded Asian city on the list, followed by another Japanese city, Osaka (no.20). Popular tourist destinations like Bangkok and Beijing lag behind, coming in at no. 69 and 85 respectively. Despite having a weaker performance generally, the report said that Asian cities showed the most improvement this year. Seoul (no.59) has the highest reputation score growth (15.1% increase from 2014), tailed by Karachi (no.91) -- Pakistan's biggest city -- which witnessed a 14% leap from last year. U.S. cities great -- but not likeable The top U.S. city on the list is San Francisco (no.24). Why such a poor result for the U.S? New York (no.31) and most of the U.S. cities on the list suffered from a \"negative emotional halo,\" said Prado \"New York is a very interesting case to analyze, because it scores highly on what we call 'rational attributes,'\" he said. \"Survey respondents put New York in the top 10 for all three dimensions: Advanced Economy (no.2), Appealing Environment (no.6), and Effective Administration (no.10).\" Prado said this means New York should be in the top 10 in the final reputation chart -- \"if we see it from a rational angle.\" However, when it comes to thinking about the U.S. brand, \"respondents recognize its greatness, but there are still some emotional barriers\" that prevent them from embracing it. \"This is what we call a negative emotional halo, which is a relevant challenge for New York and the U.S.A.\" Most reputable cities", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:44:20.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
