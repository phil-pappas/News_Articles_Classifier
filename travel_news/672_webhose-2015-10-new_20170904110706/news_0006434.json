Strong brand ... Alan Joyce painted a bright future for Qantas at the AGM in Perth.

King of the skies ... Qantas has plans for further growth internationally in the next year.

If everyone was getting the benefit of fuel than that wouldn’t be true.” \nShareholders voted in favour of Mr Joyce’s $11.8 million salary for the last year, and approved his participation in a long-term incentive program set to deliver more than $2 million in bonuses if key targets are met.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:58:24.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
