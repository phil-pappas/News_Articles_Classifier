With a third of its specialist conference and events hotels striking gold in each quarterly VenueVerdict announcement in 2015, the latest results show how QHotels continues to uphold its reputation for delivering memorable experiences, inspired by its conference and events customers. \nAnnounced by BDRC Continental, the UK’s largest independent research consultancy, the Gold Standard Accreditation is the highest tier a hotel can achieve from VenueVerdict and is based on how likely event hosts are to recommend a venue for a conference or event. QHotels Managing Director, Michael Purtill, said: “VenueVerdict gives us valuable insight into our customers’ journeys with us, helping us measure and understand their experiences, so that we can continue to improve our approach, inspired by their feedback. “We are delighted to maintain yet another nine VenueVerdict Gold Standard Accreditations this quarter, reflecting our focus on consistency and offering the very best to our conference and events customers, who visit us time and time again and recommend us to their peers. “Belton Woods joined our portfolio less than 12 months ago, so for this hotel to have already achieved Gold Standard Accreditation is testament to the way the team have embraced QHotels’ service standards.” QHotels venues receiving the VenueVerdict Gold Standard Accreditation in Q3 are: · Ashford International Hotel (VenueVerdict’s current Number 1 Hotel) · Forest Pines Hotel & Golf Resort · The Cheltenham Chase Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:36:33.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
