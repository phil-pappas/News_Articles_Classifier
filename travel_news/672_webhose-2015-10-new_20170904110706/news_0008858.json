They can view luxuriously decorated bedrooms and a private worship hall among other treasures of the Palace Museum in Beijing. The Cining Palace complex in the western part of the Forbidden City has been opened to the outside world for the first time as part of the celebrations of the museum’s 90th anniversary. To mark the date, more than 1,000 treasures from the royal families were displayed in eight shows in four newly opened areas: the Cining Palace complex for emperors’ mothers, wings of the Meridian Gate, the East Prosperity Gate and the Baoyun Building, a warehouse built in 1914 to store treasures. Shan Jixiang, the museum director, says most of the precious items are being displayed for the first time. The shows, which took three years to prepare, offer a rare opportunity for visitors to learn more about the emperors and their families, such as the women’s residences that are often featured in films. “There are even ghost stories about the women’s residences in the Forbidden City. Now visitors can see that the stories are just tales,” says Shan. One of areas opened up is the Shoukang Palace, which forms a part of the Cining Palace complex. Music maker: the musical instruments used for operas performed at royal birthdays The Shoukang Palace, which was the residence of Empress Dowager Chongqing, the mother of Emperor Qianlong (1711-99), has been restored. The bedrooms, the rooms where she met her son and a private worship hall offer visitors a peek into her daily routine. Chongqing lived to the age of 86 and her son, known to be a good ruler, showed great love and respect to her. The emperor did plenty of calligraphy for his mother and held lavish birthday ceremonies for her. More than 200 items and treasures on display at the Shoukang Palace give glimpses into her daily life. They include the formal clothes she wore while meeting subjects, a rosewood closet full of exquisite jewellery and big red coral ruyi (an S-shaped ornament believed to be a symbol of good luck). She also had a private garden as big as a football field, in which a private hall to worship the Buddha was located. There are more than 40 worship halls dedicated to the Buddha in the Forbidden City, but hers has more than 1,000 golden finger-sized Buddha statues. There are ghost stories about the women’s residences in the Forbidden City. Now visitors can see the stories are just tales Wen Ming, director of the religion department at the museum, says: “It’s the first time that a worship hall in the Forbidden City had been opened to the public. Many emperors’ wives and concubines had worship halls in their residences. They all believed in Buddha.” Besides the worship halls, the Cining Palace has more than 500 sculptures on display, mostly large-size Buddha statues. Some are more than 2,200 years old. The sculptures are made of stone, wood, silver, gold and jade. In keeping with the museum’s anniversary celebrations, the recently opened Meridian Gate, the biggest exhibition hall, has a birthday-themed show where items including clothes, gifts, musical instruments and recipes of the royals are displayed. The birthdays of the emperors and their mothers were national celebrations. Decorative symbol: a large Chinese character meaning 'longevity' A painting of the 60th birthday celebration of Emperor Kangxi is on show for the first time. The work, 130ft (40m) long, depicts a street view of 18,000 people marking the event. The show also includes a room displaying birthday gifts given to the emperors, including a gilded rifle presented by Lord Macartney, the envoy sent by George III, in 1793. “We have found lots of birthday gifts sent by foreign countries to emperors of the Qing Dynasty [1644-1911] in our warehouses. The rifle from Britain is one for which we have the most details,” says Ren Wanping, director of the antiques department at the museum. Britain, then in the midst of the Industrial Revolution, sent many items. Among the gifts are also screens with poems written by emperors’ sons and grandsons, a rare chance to see the handwriting of descendants of Emperor Kangxi (1662-1722). His reign marked the start of a relatively prosperous period for the dynasty. His son and grandson were also able rulers. Visitors are flocking to the news shows, which also feature old houses in the Forbidden City, and there are often long queues. This article was originally produced and published by China Daily.
