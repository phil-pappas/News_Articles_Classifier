Shot all over India over a period of 21 days in August this year, these photographs have been compiled into the ace shutterbug's latest book \"India through the eyes of Raghu Rai\".\nFrom a panorama of jet-black clouds gathering over a beach in Mahabalipuram, to a solitary scooter whizzing past ferns and junipers on a lonely Himalayan road, the photographs take a new meaning in the master shutterbug's hands, turning ubiquitous images into moments charged with life, energy and vitality.\nFor Rai, the ease offered by a device stripped away of most of the complex features and functions found in a professional camera and the desire to keep experimenting were what drew him to the project.\nPhoto: PTI\n\"It was the freedom and the ease which I got from this. I simply kept playing with it like a toy. For me at this point in my life I don't want to behave like a serious guy. I want to play around with tools and things. This project was a fascinating affair with no responsibilities and no liabilities,\" he told PTI on the sidelines of his book's launch here late last evening.\nBut then for someone who has never used a phone camera for professional purposes, it would normally be expected that the shift would be somewhat jarring because of the limitations and challenges thrown up by a new device.\nRai though, has a different take on it. \"If you learn to minimise your needs, then the more you are acutely aware of what you need to do...to simplify those extra gadgets and weights and be free of it. Thanks to digital technology you don't have to do anything (because of the built in features). It gives you all the freedom to capture the variety and spirit,\" he says.\nRai says he does not he had no ideas fixed in his mind when he goes about clicking pictures.\n\"I don't decide what to shoot. Whatever captures me in that moment, I capture. Because that would be anti-creativity for me.\"\n lifestyle India travel photography panorama Raghu Rai Also Read India take on Nepal in international football friendly Aliens could be discovered within 20 years Exercise boosts tumour-fighting ability of chemotherapy This calendar photoshoot featuring acid attack survivors will mesmerise you", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/TeluguMatrimony_Textlink_620x40px.gif", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/raghu-rais-picture_650x400_71445411377.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/raghu-rais-picture_650x400_41445411150.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151022/lifestyle-travel/article/raghu-rais-india-through-lens-phone", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/raghu-rais-picture_650x400_41445411150.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:32:45.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
