We wanted to thank them for their outstanding contributions to science fiction and thought the best way of doing this was by paying homage to their original time-travelling journey which took place at the Hill Valley clock tower in 1955. \n\"I look forward to thanking them both in person, in the future, if I haven't already done so.\" Marty and Harp Angel, pictured alongside Belfast-built time machine at The Gasworks Clock, Belfast Oct 21, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:12:44.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
