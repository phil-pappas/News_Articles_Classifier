For Nevada children, the end of October also brings a day of no school to observe the state's Oct. 31, 1864, entry into the union as the 36th state.\nSince 2000, legislative action dictates that the state schedule its birthday on the last Friday in October, creating a three-day weekend to celebrate.\nThis year marks the 151st year since Nevada Territory became a state during the Civil War, hence Nevada's \"Battle Born\" state motto. Although Nevada Day activities take place all across the state, no town commemorates the Silver State's birthday like Carson City. Nevada's capital schedules the largest parade in the state and many auxiliary events during Nevada Day weekend. Find details at nevadaday.com.\nThe extended weekend brings crowds to Carson City when autumn foliage colors the beautiful Carson Valley. For Nevada Day, accommodations quickly fill up in Carson City, nearby Carson Valley communities and even Virginia City. Reno, Sparks and Lake Tahoe offer not-too-distant options. Remember to pack winter clothing, for there will be a chill in the air so close to the Sierras, even on bright, storm-free days.\nNo Nevada Day celebration would be complete without a carnival. The Nevada Day Fair and carnival opens at 5 p.m. Thursday in Carson City's Mills Park and closes the evening of Nov. 1. The popular event features carnival rides, food booths and games daily, with live music Saturday and Sunday.\nDuring Nevada Day weekend, state museums in Carson City will be open free of charge, including the Nevada State Museum and the Nevada Railroad Museum, which preserves 65 cars and locomotives from yesteryear. Free rides will be given on the restored McKeen motor car. On Friday, Carson City visitors can explore early state history during free guided tours of the town's historic east side, a 2-mile stroll that starts on the steps of the Capitol Building every half-hour from 10 a.m. to midafternoon.\nThe biggest day of the holiday weekend is Saturday, which falls on Nevada's real birthday this year. So many events are scheduled that they overlap. Early risers show up at the Governor's Mansion from 7 to 9:30 a.m., when the local Republican Women's Club serves a full pancake breakfast. It's $6 for adults and $3 for toddlers, and proceeds fund two scholarships. At 8 a.m., colorful hot air balloons are launched before the parade.\nFlyovers of aircraft from the Fallon Naval Station and the Nevada Air National Guard signal the start of the Nevada Day Parade at 10 a.m. The 2015 theme is \"One State, Many Cultures.\" This year marks the 77th annual parade. Thousands line the route on Carson Street through downtown.\nA couple of hundred entries come from all over Nevada, including equestrian groups, horse-drawn vehicles, military honor guards, costumed Native Americans, decorated floats and plenty of vintage vehicles.\nEvents taking place during the parade include a beard contest and the world champion single-jack rock-drilling contest. Many paradegoers gravitate to the Carson Nugget for the free chili feed, which was started in 1982 by then-Attorney General Richard Bryan and this year is hosted by Sen. Dean Heller.\nâ€” Margo Bartlett Pesek's Trip of the Week column appears on Sundays.\nSpirit of Old West alive in...
