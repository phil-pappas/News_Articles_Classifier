As the night unfolds, the participants’ roles and their interactions determine the dynamics of the experience much as the dictation of social norms directed the flow of past gatherings. All the World’s a Stage, in reference to Shakespeare’s play, is a reflection of the orchestrated nature of society and our places within it.\nAs in the more glamorous days of social celebrations, guests will be asked to suit up in their Sunday best and join fellow partygoers “on stage,” to revel in the excess of this traditional, food-focused celebration. The table will be laden with rich offerings of the autumn harvest and the air full of hearty holiday glee. As part of a new format to stretch the legs and ease the strain of full bellies, guests can retire to a post-dinner lounge for a nightcap (or two) as the evening drifts away.\nThe menu will not be released until the evening of the event to guests. This event will see a special collaboration on menu design between a surprise Silver.Spoon chef and Four Seasons Hotel Ritz Lisbon Executive Chef Pascal Meynard.\nExcited about his first guerilla dining experience with Silver.Spoon in Lisbon, and bursting with out-of-the-box ideas, Chef Pascal Meynard says, “Although there have been supper clubs across the world for some years, the guerrilla concept takes the exclusivity to another level, and it will allow me to experiment and ultimately surprise people.”\nTo discover the name of the Silver.Spoon chef and to learn of newly unveiled pieces of information about this unique event, check in to Silver.Spoon or Four Seasons Hotel Ritz Lisbon on social media.\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:05:57.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
