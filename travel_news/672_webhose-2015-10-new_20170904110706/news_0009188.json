So who will be the travelers of the future and what will they want and expect from their travel experiences?\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278982-INFO\nFuture Traveller Tribes 2030, a report commissioned by global travel technology company, Amadeus, and written by consumer trends consultancy The Future Foundation , reveals how the travel landscape is evolving and the types of travelers that are expected to rise in prominence over the next 15 years.\nThe free, downloadable report unveils six categories of \"Traveler Tribes\" that are set to emerge or grow based around traveler desires, needs and behaviors instead of traditional demographics such as gender or age:\nSocial Capital Seekers: structure their holidays almost exclusively with online audiences in mind, relying heavily on peer reviews and recommendations to validate their decisions. Cultural Purists: look at time away as a chance to immerse themselves in a different – even uncomfortably so – culture, where enjoyment of their break depends on the authenticity of the experience. Ethical Travelers : make travel plans based on moral grounds, for example, decreasing their carbon footprint or improving the lives of others. Simplicity Searchers : seek ease and transparency and enjoy their vacations without the stress of organizing them. These travelers are eager for restful vacations and are happy to take bundled offers rather than managing every detail themselves. Obligation Meeters: driven by a specific purpose for travel, whether business or leisure, and thus have constraints on time and budget. Reward Hunters : primarily interested in indulgent travel, craving something that represents an extraordinary reward or 'must have' premium experience. These travelers seek a return on their hard-earned investment of time and energy in their working lives. The comprehensive report findings are based on interviews with leading futurologists, travel industry experts and travelers around the world.\nTravelers who want to find out what Tribe they most align with can take Amadeus' short online quiz . An Amadeus survey of 800 U.S. travelers revealed that most respondents (67%) identified with Simplicity Searchers.\n\"Major changes are on the horizon in how travelers seek, consider and select destinations, consume travel services and make purchasing decisions. The travel industry, and the technology that powers it, needs to focus on evolving along with the travelers who will shape the future,\" said Scott Alvis , Chief Marketing Officer, Amadeus North America .\nTechnology will play a key role in enabling traveler experiences across all the Tribes. Faster connection speeds, the growth of social media platforms and the emergence of smart technologies will certainly create a world in the coming years that looks different than today. This new world could likely include a greater number of driverless cars, more efficient aircrafts and high speed rail carriers that will disrupt and improve the way consumers travel to their destinations for the better. As technology propels us forward at a record-breaking speed, the resulting innovations show no sign of slowing down.\nMedia Inquiries:\nDebbie Iannaci\nDirector, Corporate Communications\nAmadeus North America\n305.499.6448\ndiannaci@amadeus.com\nJessica Nelson\nAccount Director\nKwittken for Amadeus North America\n646.747.7141\namadeusnoram@kwittken.com\nFollow us on:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nYouTube\nBlog\nGoogle+\nPinterest\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150407/197267LOGO\n releases/6-traveler-tribes-that-will-be-prominent-by-2030-revealed-in-amadeus-report-300163898.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/113862376434257859271/posts", "http://tinyurl.com/ot7fyq3", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=FL34104&Transmission_Id=201510220830PR_NEWS_USPR_____FL34104&DateId=20151022", "https://www.facebook.com/AmadeusITGroup", "http://tinyurl.com/q8y9mln", "https://twitter.com/AmadeusITGroup", "http://blogamadeus.com/feed/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/AmadeusITGroup", "http://www.pinterest.com/amadeusitgroup/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150407/197267LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150407/197267LOGO", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/2780?trk=tyah", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/6-traveler-tribes-that-will-be-prominent-by-2030-revealed-in-amadeus-report-300163898.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278982-INFO", "http://www.amadeus.com/nablog/2015/05/understanding-tomorrows-traveler-u-s-consumer-survey-reveals-associated-travel-tribe/leisure-travel"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:09:32.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
