But now it’s down around $45 and a harsh reality has set in. \nWhen lifting costs exceed revenues off goes the power and out come the chains. \nAnd the Christmas trees – Oil Patch-Speak for the stack of pipes and valves bolted to the top of the well bore – are shut-in pending the outcome of a game of economic chicken being played out halfway around the world. \nOf course, anyone in oil and gas knows that booms and busts are part of the DNA. \nBut the busts still hurt. \nUnless you’re a ruffed grouse. \nRuffies and the oil patch share a symbiotic relationship. Oil roads and drilling leases driven though the aspen uplands of west central Alberta have created thousands of kilometres of transitional “edge” where grouse love to hang out. \nWhile energy companies are mandated to over-seed disturbed ground to prevent erosion. \nThese seed mixtures inevitably include red clover. Ruffies in fall gorge on the stuff. \nWhen revenues are restricted, oil road maintenance and truck traffic declines and the clover crop flourishes even more. \nIt’s a perfect storm out there and my bird hunting buddy Emmerson and I are headed out to Lodgepole to hopefully exploit it. \nThe cadence of oil roads don’t necessarily follow any logic or pattern. When there’s a road grader up ahead the task of sticking with the path most travelled becomes even more problematic. \nWe somehow made it somewhere south of Sand Creek where Emmerson spotted a bird in the ditch. \nI followed it up a hillside and gave it both barrels from my Ruger. I thought it fell on the second shot but neither my fox red Lab Penny nor I could find it. But on the hike down to the Jeep its partner appeared. One shot, one ruffie in the bag. \nEmmerson harvested Flush No. 2. Another road edge bird. \nA good start and the dog hadn’t had a hunt yet. \nAn over-gown lease road that led back to some silent wells simply screamed grouse. \nWe parked the truck and let the dog out. Penny almost immediately got birdie but when no flush happened we moved on. \nComing up to a corner, which is a favorite grouse hangout, she cut a hot scent again. \nWhen the fourth flush came we only caught a glimpse of the fleeing bird. \nA little farther up the trail the dog made game and disappeared on a long hunt back into a cutblock. \nThere was a whirr behind us. Grouse five must have crossed the road. \nBut the sixth bird wasn’t so wily and it folded when my string of 7 1/2 caught up with it. \nWe were shortcutting down an ancient Alberta Gas Trunk Line right-of-way when the seventh flush of the day lifted off. \nAnother heard-but-never-seen bird. \nThe last bird in the bag fell to Emmerson’s Berretta. When he and Penny went to retrieve it at the road edge two more ruffies flushed. And were mysteriously swallowed up by the forest. \nBringing the day’s total to 4 for 10. \nWhich is not a bad way to celebrate a holly, jolly, melancholy Oil Patch Christmas. \nwww.neilwaughoutdoors.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:46:55.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
