Guests also are encouraged to dress up in their own stellar costumes. A shipboard version of the popular Jedi Training experience invites young Jedi hopefuls to learn lightsaber moves from a Jedi Master. They can then use the Force and face off in a final test against the evil Darth Vader. Kids and families enjoy friendly competition during Star Wars trivia games, covering fun facts from the film and television sagas. For Younglings, Star Wars-themed arts and crafts, games and activities will be offered throughout the day in Oceaneer Club and Oceaneer Lab youth clubs.
