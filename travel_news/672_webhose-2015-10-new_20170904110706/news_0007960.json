You’ve curated your perfect driving playlist, armed yourself with a few entertaining car games and watched a few of the best road trip movies for inspiration. You’re ready to set off on a British road trip. Now there’s just one more thing to do: decide where to drive. Here are three brilliant options for driving routes in the UK. Along the Cornish Peninsula Visit the residents of the Cornish Seal Sanctuary in Gweek Photo: Alamy Driving route: This 58-mile trip starts in the ancient maritime town of Falmouth, travels inward towards Gweek, and then back out to Lizard Point before finishing at Porthleven Harbour. Time needed: A full day. Key features: With its glorious green landscape dotted with picturesque seaside villages, the Cornish peninsula is an outstanding area of natural and breathtaking beauty. This route provides stunning views over the Atlantic and makes for a packed day of sightseeing. Where to stop: Falmouth’s National Maritime Museum gives you a great sense of Cornwall’s nautical heritage, while the nearby Trebah Gardens provide a lovely stroll through a 26-acre subtropical ravine. It is listed as one of the top 80 gardens in the world. If you’re travelling with kids, they will love the Cornish Seal Sanctuary at Gweek. The small and unspoilt fishing village of Coverack is a beautiful spot where a local windsurfing centre offers activities from beginners upwards. Meanwhile Poldark fans will appreciate the wild landscape at Gunwalloe Cove where the show’s famous shipwreck scene was filmed. The trip ends in Porthleven – home to Rick Stein’s latest seafood restaurant, where you can eat dinner looking out over the historic harbour. English History tour A visit to Bath can be spent exploring the old town and the incredible Roman Baths Photo: Corbis Driving route: Travelling from London to Stonehenge and then Bristol before heading back to the capital via Bath and Oxford, this trip covers 264 miles. Time needed: Three days. Key features: You take in thousands of years of England’s history in a journey that brings the past very much to life.

Then head over to Bath where you can spend day two exploring the old town and the incredible Roman Baths. You might also consider taking afternoon tea at one of the city’s luxury hotels. Then drive to Oxford, where day three is a walking tour of the famous colleges before finally heading back to London.
