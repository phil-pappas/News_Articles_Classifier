Meetings and events planners can organise with staff and volunteers by uploading their roles, shifts and details to the app. \nThe technology also allows meetings and events planners to send out bulk emails, staff to sign up and check in for shifts, provides automatic reminders and updates on schedule changes, recommends replacements for shifts with shortfalls, has a one-tap communication system and filtered broadcasts for targeting specific groups of people.
