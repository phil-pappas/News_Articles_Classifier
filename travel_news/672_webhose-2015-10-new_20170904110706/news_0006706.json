Airport As airports continue to remodel themselves to better reflect their destination, local chefs from Rick Bayless in Chicago and Michael Voltaggio in Los Angeles have opened gate-side restaurants. Now fliers traveling through Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport just outside of Washington, D.C., can skip Starbucks and dine at the new Kapnos Taverna, a Greek restaurant from the chef Mike Isabella. A more casual iteration of his original Kapnos Taverna in Arlington, Va., the airport location serves flatbread with dips like tzatziki and hummus, Mediterranean small plates such as roasted cauliflower, and more flight-sustaining fare including lamb chops. Air China Comes to Newark Beginning today, Air China will begin new direct service between Newark and Beijing. The New Jersey flights, which start at $848 round trip, will take place four times weekly — Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays — on Boeing 777-300ER jets. The Chinese airline already serves Kennedy Airport in New York twice daily. By the end of 2015,it says it will offer nonstop service between Beijing and nine North American cities, including Los Angeles, Houston and San Francisco. Air China is a member of the Star Alliance with United Airlines.

The Sunday-only flights contain Business, Premium Economy and Economy classes. The most forward cabin features a chair that converts into a bed, a 16-inch touch screen and a touch-screen handset. Premium Economy offers 40 percent more space compared with Economy. Air France began running the new jets in summer 2014 and expects to have 44 of them in service by July 2016. Boston is the fourth American city to get the jets, after New York, Los Angeles and Washington. Air France is a member of the Skyteam alliance, which includes Delta Air Lines.

The 469-passenger jet features four levels of service, including First Class, which comes with a quilted mattress and cotton pajamas; Club World business class, with lie-flat seats; and World Traveller Plus, its premium economy cabin. Miami is the fourth American city to have British Airways’ A380 service, after Los Angeles, Washington and San Francisco.
