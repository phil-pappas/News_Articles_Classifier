While Halloween may offer one enchanted evening of parties, candy, and numerous costumes, a Murder Mystery Weekend puts you in the heart of whodunit – and there are several inns in on all the action during October and beyond. So amateur Agatha Christies unite! If you dare to play detective while you dine, the following inns offer experiences you’ll find very appetizing. \nGuests get a full serving of excitement with the Taste of Wine and Murder Mystery Package at Meadows Inn in New Bern, NC. The fun begins on Friday evening when guests become characters suspected of the crime in question. The plot unfolds at dinner on Saturday evening. The events usually have 6 to 12 participants, and it is a 4-room minimum required for the experience. Aside from plenty of suspense and fun at Saturday evening’s dinner, the package includes 2 nights lodging; wine and cheese socials on both Friday and Saturday nights; and breakfast each morning. Events run throughout the year, and reservations must be made at least 1 month in advance. Current rate for the experience is $45.00 per person, plus a regular room rate for 2 nights. Call for scheduled dates, or make your own group and schedule a weekend just for your friends. \nMurder in motion is the name of the game at Cabernet Inn in North Conway, NH. Their Murder Mystery Dinner Train experience features 2 nights’ accommodations; a 3-hour train ride on the Conway Scenic Rail Road in magnificent Mt. Washington Valley; a Champagne toast with the innkeepers before embarking full steam ahead on this unforgettable evening; a 4-course fine dining meal that slays guests’ hunger for enticing entrees; two tickets to a 3-hour murder mystery “who dun-it” theatrical performance by Arts in Motion; and a full cooked-to-order gourmet breakfast each morning. Prices are per couple, per room. Rates and themes change seasonally, so be sure to contact the inn for additional and updated event information. \nGetting into character and getting “inn” on the case is what guests enjoy during Murder Mystery Nights at Bross Hotel B&B in Paonia, CO. If you’re ready for action, let’s set the scene: In a harbor village filled with backstabbers and buccaneers looking to get ahead, there is little reward for honesty and a high price to pay for deceit. We all know pirates are unsavory characters, but will one of these cutthroats murder one of their own? Or, maybe, the deed was done by a landlubber. Who would commit murder? Guests will only know by participating in the game. Events run throughout the year and registration is 3 weeks prior to the occasion, so that attendees can receive their roles, information about them (not a script), and prepare their costumes. Package rates are $250/couple or $175/single and feature a role in the murder mystery, dinner, a 1-night stay at the inn, and a tasty breakfast. \nGuests make a killing when it comes to the Michigan Murder Mystery Special Package from Kingsley House Bed and Breakfast in Fennville, MI. This memorable and fun escape to the Wolverine State features a welcome gift when you arrive; a 5-course gourmet dinner with wine on Saturday evening; a murder mystery played out over course of the meal; and buffet breakfast every morning. Dinners vary by theme, and of course, costumes are encouraged as a great way to experience the role you play. The dates for the event take place each year during select weekends of November through April, so be sure to check with the inn for further details and updates. Rates are just $139 for two guests, over and above the cost of the room when they reserve any room or suite for 2 nights or more. \nCapturing the killer is the main course on the menu for the Dinner & Mystery Package from Lyons Twins Mansions in Fort Scott, KS. This private dinner party and overnight involves 8 to 10 guests who are willing to take a playful attitude toward blackmail, sex, larceny, murder and plenty of deceit. As characters in the game, all participants are suspects with appropriate motives and possible means. Arrangements for date and time are made with the inn several weeks prior to the big night. Assign your characters early so they may shop Good Will and garage sales to find the perfect vintage attire. The package includes a decadent dinner and gourmet breakfast the morning after. The price is $37.95 per person with 3-course dinner included, in addition to regular overnight room rates. Rent 4-5 guestrooms for both Friday and Saturday nights at a regular rate, and your Mystery and Dinner is FREE. \nKilling time is easy when you travel, and with the Murder Mystery Packages at The Inn at Locke House in Lockeford, CA guests can also journey to another era – if they make the most of their imaginations. The game can go anywhere (and everyone is fair game), so keeping your wits about you will prove very worthwhile. This special experience focuses on fabulous food and fun. Here you can let your inner actor and/or actress emerge while putting your sleuthing skills to the test. The package includes a cocktail party; two dinners with wine, lunch or tea; a secret excursion; 2 brunches; and 2 nights at the inn, all for only $489 per couple. The event requires just 8 attendees, and when one couple does the recruiting (to get the three additional couples to sign on), the inn will upgrade them to the Water Tower Suite for the entire weekend. \nNote: Packages are for adults only. Be sure to check with the inn you’re interested in for current rates and dates prior to booking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:30:11.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
