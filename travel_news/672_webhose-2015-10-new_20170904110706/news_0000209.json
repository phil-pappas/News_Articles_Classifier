How wrong I was. In a losing cause, Schalk Burger, Lood de Jager, Eben Etzebeth and Francois Louw were outstanding in their work rate and tenacity as the Springboks strove manfully to deny New Zealand quick ball and breakdown dominance. The ferocity of their tackling and physical commitment could not have been greater; it was just a pity they did not have a set of backs with the creativity to make use of what ball they did produce. It was a similar story for Argentina. Up front they more than matched Australia and their scrum was dominant throughout. Leonardo Senatore, Pablo Matera and Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe contested toe-to-toe with one of the world’s most effective back rows and came out even. Australia’s accuracy under pressure was seminal in beating Argentina. Taking try-scoring chances has distinguished the best teams from the good Juan Imhoff , Juan Martín Hernández and Joaquín Tuculet formed a bold back three, making several linebreaks from counter-attacks. If the Pumas had had more composure at crucial moments they would have scored tries, but their failure to do so and the Wallabies’ precision decided it. For the All Blacks, Dan Carter has approached his old form and his tactical nous kept them in Springbok territory for the final few minutes so South Africa could not work a kickable penalty or drop goal. His own drop goal was crucial when New Zealand were down to 14 men. Yet another tremendous performance came from David Pocock, one of the tournament’s best players, and Scott Fardy did what he does best – much hard work that went largely unheralded. Australia’s accuracy under pressure was seminal in beating Argentina. Taking try-scoring chances has distinguished the best teams from the good. Australia wing Adam Ashley-Cooper gave a masterclass in finishing and for that he is the Liontrust Hero of the semi-finals.
