Because HNL is mainly a leisure destination this will probably be QF's last route they'll want to use the Business Suite on\n5 report reply 2 10 hours, 23 minutes ago by riley I know it's only a render but gee that's a nice looking suite.\nHaving the side by side option is also a positive given there would be a lot of couple's travelling to HNL.\nIt makes hubbing through HNL an option for U.S. bound travellers with a nice break on the way home.\n3 report reply 1 7 hours, 13 minutes ago by Abarth33 Agree - good to see some fresh product.\nNot sure about the mini shower screen from my nan's house, though...\n3 report reply 3 9 hours, 58 minutes ago by highflyer Really? Tablets for inflight entertainment for an international business class?!\n0 report reply 1 9 hours, 52 minutes ago by sagidec I personally find tablets such as iPad more responsive to touches than the standard Panasonic screens with lagging response time in loading pages. Maybe a good thing for now? Perhaps iPad Pro with bigger screen can compensate the experience?\n10 report reply 4 9 hours, 44 minutes ago by smit0847 That foot-well looks ridiculously tight. A pair of feet is not triangular.\n9 report reply 1 8 hours, 47 minutes ago by undertheradar +1 to that smit0847. the foot 'space' looks pretty much useless... and the 76in 'bed' includes about 6in of unuseable/useless footspace...unless you are happy sleeping with your ankles/feet crossed...and the window pax still dont have direct aisle access...HA have crammed a 1-2-1 product into a 2-2-2 config..that's a fail for me\n6 report reply 1 8 hours, 22 minutes ago by Mark Agree 2-2-2 forget it !\n1 report reply 5 6 hours, 18 minutes ago by StudiodeKadent The product certainly LOOKS nice, and technically it does have direct aisle access. But it provides it in a very space-inefficient manner (taking space out of all six footwells in a row, when technically only two footwells per row needed to have their space reduced to provide direct aisle access) whilst also reducing comfort for all flyers. Not to mention that four out of the six seats per row face into the aisle. This isn't exactly the best for passenger privacy.This really does look like a mistake. Surely it would've been both more competitive and more space-efficient for them to just get a customized Cirrus or Super Diamond implementation? They could've probably fit at least 18 Cirrus/SD suites into the same space, providing longer and wider beds without the possibility of bumping into someone else's feet. I guess they can mitigate some of these problems by making the aisle seats in the side pairs have shields around the footwell (these seats would be prioritized for shorter passengers, and given Hawaiian airlines probably flies plenty of Asian people who are generally a little shorter than people of European ancestry this would probably be okay). In addition, installing an additional padded shelf on the central seats and the window seats that fits in the space where the pseudo-aisle would be (to increase the size of the footwell for those passengers) would fix their footwell problem.\nI like the styling of the product, but I still think it doesn't really compete very well. Cirrus or SD would have none of the problems I described and probably be able to fit in more passengers within the same space.\n-2 report reply 1 5 hours, 9 minutes ago by whipper I think everyone has got the wrong end of the stick here - did you see what they called international business before? It was a joke and only comparable to a LCC, so their new iteration is brilliant in comparison and really should only be compared to the the current QF business product plying the Pacific....\n0 report reply 1 3 hours, 51 minutes ago by StudiodeKadent Oh, I certainly don't contest that the product is an improvement. It certainly is an improvement over what they had!\nBut remember QF will eventually be flying Business Suites to Honolulu. And frankly, fully-flat Skybeds are more private than this product overall, and offer bigger beds.\nAdditionally its only a matter of time before the US airlines up their game and offer better products to Honolulu. And then there are the Asian carriers whom Hawaiian competes with.\n3 report reply 6 5 hours, 11 minutes ago by Chris_PER It was looking good until I saw \"tablet\". This isn't good for economy, let alone Business. Still, good enough for Americans who accept below-par airlines.", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://twitter.com/#!/djsflynn", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:46:12.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
