It's a time to bond further as a couple and to find new adventures together. \nOn many levels, our honeymoon in Jasper National Park last year ticked all our boxes: It was a chance to spend some quiet time in a beautiful winter wonderland. \nMy bride Laurie and I got married on Nov. 8, 2014, at the Freemasons' Hall in Edmonton surrounded by family and friends. After a wonderful party made the richer by the sweetness of everyone, we hit the road on Nov. 10. While technically still fall, winter was setting in. \nOur honeymoon hotel, the Pyramid Lake Resort, was great. Surrounded by absolutely stunning mountain vistas, the lodge and guest cabins looked out onto beautiful placid Pyramid Lake. \nAt night, we enjoyed dinner in The Pines Restaurant and walked out to the lake for some astrophotography. \nOne of the beautiful things about Jasper at night is it's a designated Dark Sky Reserve, so light pollution is minimal. It's the perfect place to learn or fine-tune your night photography skills. \nDuring the day, we explored Jasper's town site and hiked around nearby lakes, some already frozen. We repeatedly ran into the herd of elk that inhabits areas near -- and sometimes inside -- the town. \nBeing history buffs, both Laurie and I enjoyed visiting Jasper's train station (a heritage building built in 1926) and the town museum, which explores the history of Jasper both as a fur-trading centre and a tourism destination. \nA particular highlight of the trip was an excursion we took with SunDog Tours. Guide Bruce McAlpine is highly knowledgeable, and speaks with authority about the history and wildlife of the area. \nMcAlpine picked us up from our resort and the tour started with a stop at Patricia Lake, where we learned about Project Habakkuk. The top-secret project, led by Allied engineers and Naval architects during the Second World War, tested whether a massive aircraft carrier could be constructed out of a mix of wood-pulp and ice called pykrete. With the support of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, a small prototype was built and tests conducted inside a boathouse anchored on Patricia Lake. \nAfter, we headed through town past Jasper Park Lodge and Lake Beauvert as McAlpine spoke about the history of the lodge and the railways in the area. \nWe continued east along Hwy. 16 to see two separate herds of mountain sheep. The herds -- made up of rams, lambs and ewes -- pawed at the snow-covered underbrush to find grasses for grazing. \nThen we took the Maligne Lake Road to Medicine Lake, a geological curiosity in the Rockies. Part of Canada's largest karst springs, Medicine Lake is fed from the waters of the Maligne River, which then flow underground. The lake drains like a giant bathtub without a plug. \nOur tour ended at the Maligne Canyon Lookout, where we were able to see Pyramid Mountain, the Athabasca River and Jasper town site. \nOn our own, we travelled to Maligne Lake, where we hiked along the lake taking photographs as its surface shone with sparkling ice formations. We also explored Icefields Parkway and saw Mount Edith Cavell. \nA quick check of online restaurant ratings helped direct us to everything we needed, from a good pizza place (Famoso's), to funky steakhouse Evil Dave's. \nOur dinner at Evil Dave's was a night to remember as happy staff served up interesting takes on steakhouse classics. As lovers of vintage art and culture, both Laurie and I noted the restaurant's fun pinup art decor. \nJasper's friendly people welcomed us and made our honeymoon one to remember. It was a trip not soon forgotten, taken in a pretty town surrounded by some of Canada's most breathtaking natural places. \nBack in Edmonton, we began planning a return to the mountains, where we had spent our first vacation as a married couple. \nNEED TO KNOW \n-- For information on Jasper, see: Parks Canada , Tourism Jasper , and the Tourism Jasper Blog .
