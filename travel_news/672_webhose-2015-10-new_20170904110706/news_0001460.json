'There have been numerous stabbing, shooting, arson and stone throwing attacks on people and vehicles, as well as violent clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces.\n'There's a risk that tourists or bystanders could be caught up in any incident. You should be vigilant at all times.\n'Tensions remain high and you should consider the possibility of further incidents before undertaking travel to the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Old City.\n'There have been violent demonstrations in Arab municipalities across Israel and there's potential for more demonstrations. Take extra care if a demonstration is taking place nearby and avoid large gatherings.\nThree people were killed and over 20 were injured in a 'Day of Rage' in Jerusalem, Israel, earlier this week\n'Take extra care and be vigilant when using public transport in Tel Aviv, in particular at transport hubs, and when using buses in the greater Tel Aviv area - you may wish to consider using other forms of transport.\n'Be vigilant when using Route 443 between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. There have been reports of stones and Molotov cocktails being thrown at cars on this road.\n'There is a high threat of terrorism.'\n'You should be especially vigilant after Friday prayers and on religious holidays.

There is no difference in the amount you should ready yourself.\n'You may feel safer in Tel Aviv because it is deemed less troublesome than Jerusalem - where villagers have strong beliefs and faiths - however just because you feel safer you shouldn't be drawn in. Always remain on guard.\n'This doesn't mean you can't enjoy a holiday in Israel, it is like travelling anywhere - you should always be aware.\n'I would suggest holding back a while if you were planning to book a last minute break, but it really is down to how each individual feels.\nAn Israeli police officer stands on the scene where a Jewish seminary student was stabbed in Jerusalem\nA Palestinian protester throws a molotov cocktail at Israeli troops during clashes in the West Bank city\n'I personally always carry my ID, blood type, next of kin details and travel insurance with me, even if I am going to the beach.\n'That makes it is easier to identify a person who is incapacitated and not just in death, it can help alert family and friends if you're injured.\n'As long as you take precautions you can enjoy a holiday in Israel, like I said before, my main advice is to ensure you're prepared and keep checking SCO travel advice and the news for updates.'\nA 'Day of Rage' saw three people killed and over 20 injured in Jerusalem, Israel, earlier this week.\nThe four separate attacks on Israelis saw an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldier shot and both a 13-year-old boy and a 24-year-old man stabbed within a 12-hour period.\nWhile two Palestinians, a man and a woman, were also shot and killed by police earlier in the day after they attempted to stab border patrol officers in two separate incidents.\nThe city has also experienced violence including rock and fire-bomb throwing, rioting and arson along the West Bank in the last 16 days.\nMore than 30 Israelis and Palestinians have died in the violence which follows several weeks of escalating unrest that is based on an ongoing conflict over the territory.\nThe UK Foreign Office advises people to take extra care and be vigilant when using public transport in Tel Aviv\nAn Israeli soldier fires a tear gas canister at Palestinian protesters during clashes in the West Bank city\nWHERE RECENT VIOLENCE IN ISRAEL UNFOLDED October 8: A soldier shot and killed an Arab attacker after he stabbed four people with a screwdriver in Tel Aviv.
