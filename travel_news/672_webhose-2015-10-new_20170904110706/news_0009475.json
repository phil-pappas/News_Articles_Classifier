The acquisition was made using $101 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. At the time, it represented the largest land acquisition in New Mexico's history in terms of its size and cost. \n\"Valles Caldera is a perfect example of the key role the Land and Water Conservation Fund has played in enhancing public lands from city parks to national parks over the last 50 years,\" Jewell said. \nLegislation signed last year cleared the way for the property to transition from trust management to the Park Service. \nThe secretary called on Congress to permanently earmark more funding and resources so other local communities can invest in conservation and historic preservation. Jewell also highlighted the value of the preserve to many native tribes. The Interior Department is committed to being stewards of the preserve and supporting the values held by the tribes, she said. \nPublic access is expected to increase with the change to the preserve's status, officials said. \nThink your friends should see this?
