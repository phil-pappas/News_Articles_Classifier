While the major pilgrimage called Hajj, a pillar of Islam, is performed once a year, Muslims can go to Makkah for Umrah at any time of the year. It is only during the certain dates for Hajj each year that Umrah is not performed. Hajj is completed at a particular time of the year. It starts on 8th day of Dhull-Hijjah (the month of Hajj). Dhull-Hijjah is the 12th month in Islamic lunar calendar. The key rites that are parts of Umrah comprise: Ihram - This is the condition in which a pilgrim enters after wearing the special clothes for Umrah. Hair and nails need to be trimmed before entering the state of Ihram as it is unlawful to do so after putting on the clothes for the rituals. The pilgrim cannot use attar (perfume) in this state. There are special clothes for male pilgrims but females can wear their usual clothes. Tawaf - This is the act of walking 7 times around the holy Kabah based in the courtyard of Al Masjid Al Haram (The Grand Mosque of Makkah). Sa'y - This is the walk between the hills of Safa and Marwa. These hills are located within the premise of Al Masjid Al Haram and there is a nice passage way between them. Pilgrims walk back and forth 7 times through this area for the rite of Umrah. Shaving or clipping of hair - Men typically shave all their hair but can also simply trim them. Woman can cut their hair short by length of a finger tip. Going to Makkah, the hometown of Prophet Muhammad is a wonderful opportunity and when you are in the town it is also advisable to see the other mosques here and offer prayers in all of them. Indeed, to solemnly observe any pilgrimage to Makkah, you should keep yourself busy in Salaat and du'aa at all times. You should also perform as many righteous deeds as you possibly can. Remember what Prophet Muhammad had said - \"Besides Makkah there is no city on the surface of the earth where Allah multiplies one virtue by a hundred thousand times.\" But do not expect rewards while performing these deeds because Allah accepts the acts as virtues only if they are performed selflessly and with purity of heart.After completing the rites of Umrah and offering prayers in different mosques of the city, you can also see some other places that are religiously important in the history of Islam. You may go to Jannat ul Mualla which is also called Al Hajun. This is a sacred place as it was in this region that Prophet Muhammad's wives, his grandfather and other people from his family were buried. Another good place to see is the Mountain of Light or Jabal Al Noor. Prophet Muhammad came to this mountain for introspection. The Cave of Hira where the first words of Holy Quran were taught to Prophet Muhammad by Jibril is also located on this mountain. The Cave of Hira on the top of the rocky mountain and it is not easy for everyone to climb up to the spot. The elderly and small children in your group or anyone who has difficulty in climbing cliffs can watch the spot from some distance because this too is a source of gratification. Make your Umrah trip truly divine and unforgettable by seeing all the religious places during your trip and being virtuous throughout. Do not harm anyone including animals. The delight of performing Umrah at least once in a lifetime is inexpressible and you feel good about your choice even as you come back from the trip.
