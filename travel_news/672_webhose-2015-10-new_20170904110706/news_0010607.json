Murderer?\n— Mel Greig (@MelGreigRadio) October 2, 2015 Ms Saldanha, 46, was found dead on December 7, 2012, just days after answering a call from Greig and Christian, on Sydney’s 2DAYFM, who pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles.\nMs Greig said her social media followers brought the tweet to her attention.\nOther Stories Hero took five bullets to stop gunman 0 comments Police building had been ‘cased’ News 0 comments First wife ‘neglected’ by cricket legend Nsw Rochelle’s sad story remains Russell’s agony Sydney Confidential Family horrified by paedo’s history News NSW police worker, gunman shot dead Breaking News “I saw the initial tweet and blocked it, but to see a cast mate retweet it was being disappointing,” Greig told The Advetiser last night\n“Jacintha Saldanha committed suicide. I did not kill her ... for profile person to encourage that kind of behaviour is irresponsible and disgusting.\n“I’ve been debating on what to do with this tweet and given it’s mental health week from this Sunday, I want to remind you all to be understanding and compassionate with mental illness. A troll is a troll and that doesn’t bother me, but re-tweeting that message is irresponsible. I’m not angry at Richard Reid, just disappointed that a profile person world encourage this.”\nThe Advertiser was unable to contact Channel 9 for comment last night.\nIF YOU SUFFER DEPRESSION, CONTACT: LIFELINE 13 11 14; SANE HELPLINE 1800 187 263; OR BEYOND BLUE 1300 224 636\nOriginally published as Mel deeply hurt by nurse tweet", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a36171a6902a231dc24cb25bb0b3e2ba", "https://twitter.com/SallyDemangos", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ac4e871329f1cd8e471519f9be792e14", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7bf14ae0d1c12d1cb56a5a56a6968a4e", "https://twitter.com/Viksister", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fa8a4a7b6145e8c7168ef4f0e6921dfe", "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/television/celebrity-apprentice-contestant-mel-greig-disappointed-by-fellow-competitors-retweet-of-comment-branding-her-a-murderer/story-fni0cjvh-1227554938344?sv=a8380e0d84189660d530284f856cdc75", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8049f65a266862a95a0507ccb3026b15", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "https://twitter.com/MelGreigRadio/status/649869843408130048", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/146cdf9d2d8538d2093979ba5db20e39", "https://twitter.com/RReidsHollywood"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:35:21.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
