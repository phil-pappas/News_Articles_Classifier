(Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nThe final US Airways flight is taking off from Philadelphia and stopping in Charlotte, North Carolina, then Phoenix and San Francisco. \nFlight 1939, named for the airline's founding year, is scheduled to depart Philadelphia International Airport at 10:05 a.m. Friday and arrive in Charlotte about two hours later. \nThe Airbus A321 will return to Philadelphia on Saturday under the American Airlines banner, following the completion of a merger announced in 2013. \nPittsburghers were upset the flight wasn't stopping there. US Airways was formed in Pittsburgh as All American Aviation. It later operated as Allegheny Airlines before becoming USAir. \nUS Airways dropped Pittsburgh as a hub in 2004 and American Airlines shut down its nearby flight operations control center in August, shifting about 650 jobs to Fort Worth, Texas. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:50:42.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
