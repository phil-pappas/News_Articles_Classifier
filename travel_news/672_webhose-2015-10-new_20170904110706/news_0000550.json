The service is useful not only for curious travelers, but in case a checked bag hasn't arrived at your destination. You'll know right away that your luggage is on the wrong plane, and you won't have to stand at baggage claim for an hour wondering if your bag will be coming. You'll know it went to Tokyo instead of Las Vegas and can seek help from the lost-bag department. \nFliers can go to AA.com/baggage , click on \"track your bags\" and input a last name and record locator or bag-tag number. The site will return information on six bag-scan touch points, such as ticket counter check-in and loading on and off the aircraft. A few other airlines, notably Delta Air Lines and US Airways, which is now merged with American, offer the service, too. -- Gregory Karp, Chicago Tribune", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:03:46.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
