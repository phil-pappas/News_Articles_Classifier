But nowadays, the country, and especially Aqaba, its southernmost city, is increasingly finding favour as a leisure destination. Now with more hotels and other planned tourist facilities, it’s the place to go, whether for you a “holiday” means rest and relaxation by the beach or pool, or you’re looking for a multifaceted break, mixing a wealth of sensational sightseeing with some well-earned relaxation. Indeed, the modern port is well positioned for visiting nearby Petra and Wadi Rum, and together these three must-dos could be said to form Jordan’s own “Golden Triangle” of attractions, a perfect first-visit itinerary for visitors new to the country. Snorkelling, windsurfing, waterskiing, jet skiing, sailing and other water sports are available, as well as a range of land-based sports within the resorts Aqaba lies on the most northern tip of the Red Sea and has been described as a less touristy version of Egypt’s Sharm El Sheikh. The city offers a wide range of accommodation, from five-star resorts to more modest hotels, and there is also a campsite on the beach. Five-star names including InterContinental, Kempinski, Mövenpick and Radisson Blu have opened resorts in the area, along with a wealth of other brands, from DoubleTree by Hilton to MY Hotel. The Westin Saraya Aqaba by Westin Hotels and Resorts, a 300-room beachfront resort, is set to open in June 2016. Seeing red: Aqaba has been described as a less touristy version of Sharm el Sheikh There’s a good choice of restaurants, too, both independent and within the resorts. Fresh fish is exceptionally good. You’ll also find a selection of hand-crafted souvenirs to take home, such as traditional Bedouin jewellery. The Queen Noor Al-Hussein Foundation supports local craftspeople and supplies several outlets in Aqaba with handmade clothing, carpets, cushion covers, wall hangings, pottery and glassware. Being by the sea, Aqaba offers spectacular scuba diving all year round, with different aquatic species to see in the different seasons. In June and July, for example, you may spot whale sharks, while in February mantas can be seen. The sea in the Gulf of Aqaba is invariably calm and there are spectacular soft and hard coral formations to marvel at. The Red Sea Marine Peace Park is particularly noteworthy, and there are more than 30 diving sites around Aqaba, with dive operators and qualified instructors available for every level. Snorkelling, windsurfing, waterskiing, jet skiing, sailing and other water sports are available, as well as a range of land-based sports within the resorts. Plans are well in hand to make Aqaba even more appealing as an exceptional Red Sea resort. The Marsa Zayed Project, a huge development on the waterfront, features shops, entertainment, hotels, high-rise residential towers and a state-of-the-art cruise ship terminal that will transform Aqaba into a premier yachting destination. And the $1bn Ayla Oasis project, scheduled for completion in 2017, will also have high-end hotels and residential communities, a marina, shops, cafés and entertainment venues, all built around a man-made lagoon. It will also host Jordan’s first 18-hole golf course. Meanwhile – and perhaps most exciting of all – a planned 184-acre Star Trek theme park called the Red Sea Astrarium has received $1.5bn funding and the official backing of Jordan’s King Abdullah. His Majesty is an ardent Trekkie who has even appeared as an extra in Star Trek: Voyager . The park will have night-time shows, restaurants, hotels and shops, and a state-of-the-art space-flight adventure simulator ride - another reason why Jordan really is becoming out of this world as a holiday destination.
