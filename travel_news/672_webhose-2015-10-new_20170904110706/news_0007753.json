If approved, their status is good for five years. Those who belong to other trusted traveler programs such as NEXUS or Global Entry can take part in TSA PreCheck without enrolling separately. More than 1.5 million travelers are part of the PreCheck program.\nNon-enrolled fliers, who've been pre-screened, have been allowed to access the expedited lines, frustrating PreCheck members who say those passengers bog down the process and are able to access a perk that others have paid for.\nThe TSA has started to address the issue. On Sept. 13, the agency officially stopped using behavior detection officers and some other layers of security to screen non-enrolled fliers for entry to the PreCheck lanes.\n“Overall, the agency is now moving toward offering TSA PreCheck expedited screening only to trusted and pre-vetted travelers enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program and is working with a number of partners to expand enrollment in (the) program,’’ TSA spokesman Bruce Anderson said.\nPeter Krein, a PreCheck participant and member of USA TODAY’s panel of Road Warriors , said he has seen a noticeable difference in the amount of time he spends waiting to clear security at his home airport of San Diego International, as well as other destinations.\n“It has been again a pleasure to speed through TSA security without confused non-enrollees wondering why their traveling companions cannot also proceed through PreCheck and then wondering where bins can be found,’’ said Krein, a senior director of medical and scientific affairs, who is based in Carlsbad, Calif.\nFor PreCheck members such as Krein, “a 15-minute wait is considered unacceptable,’’ he said. Although he experienced wait times of 10 to 12 minutes not long ago, Krein now clears security in five to seven minutes at such airports as LAX, Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington Reagan National.\nUSA TODAY Road Warrior Marjorie McLaughlin, a director of library relations management in San Diego, has also noticed a shorter wait time at airports in Philadelphia and Sacramento, as well as Oakland and San Diego. “I’d say I seldom wait more than one to two minutes,’’ she said. “Non-PreCheck travelers are usually less familiar with the routines and caused annoying delays. ... I don’t suffer lines gladly.’’\nSome pre-screened passengers who haven’t enrolled are still being allowed to join the PreCheck lines. Some frequent fliers said that what’s supposed to be a speedy process remains an annoying slog.\n“Lines are long and slow with people that do not understand PreCheck,’’ said Corina Bilger, a USA TODAY Road Warrior who is a director of sales, based in Wilsonville, Ore. “They may have barred a few folks, but really, they should limit the enrollment opportunities. Of course, that won't happen. It’s a cash cow.”\nThe entity that performs enrollment services for the TSA said in late September it would continue to extend the hours at certain application sites, allowing more travelers to enroll in PreCheck.\nBilger said the delays she’s experienced make her question why she bothered participating in the program. “I do somewhat feel it wasn’t worth it,’’ she said. PreCheck lines at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Portland International sometimes “get bogged down with ... folks who do not appear to be experienced travelers,'' she said. \"On occasion, it’s faster to go through the regular lines, and that’s just not right.’’\nRoad Warrior Brook Redemann, a vice president for special projects and trade shows who lives in Glenview, Ill, says, “When the TSA opened up PreCheck to the wider audience of non-business travelers, any time savings was lost. ... It significantly impacted the frequent business traveler.’’\n7 CONNECT 23 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 //usat.ly/1LEj7Ze TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27f6664fb8ef48299f06ee96e2d6771613497b2a/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805218359723633-GTY-475634220-73492026.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LEj7Ze&text=TSA%20PreCheck%20changes%20ease%20lines%20for%20some&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LEj7Ze&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1LEj7Ze", "https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/usatodayroadwarriorsoptinsurvey", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805218359723633-GTY-475634220-73492026.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635805218359723633-GTY-475634220-73492026.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-19T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:45:46.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
