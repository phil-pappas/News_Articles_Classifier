They are travel experts who create extraordinary travel experiences by immersing themselves in the culture, relying on local expertise and welcoming locals to assist them in discovering the best of each area. This creates magical moments for those who travel with Asia Transpacific Journeys. In 1998, the company's investment in Asia developed into a philanthropic commitment to the region, with a select group of charitable initiatives to aid ailing parts of many locations by creating the Asia Transpacific Foundation. As the region has faced natural disasters, Asia Transpacific Journeys has stood by their friends abroad to help regain and reestablish the cherished areas their travelers return home from raving about. \nThe Asia Transpacific Foundation invests in education, conservation, sustainable economic development and emergency relief in Asia and the Pacific, and invites their travelers to visit these projects in person to gain a personal grasp of the issues facing the destinations where Asia Transpacific Foundation assists. \nThe foundation began with the Clean Water Initiative in rural Myanmar (Burma). The foundation created revolutionary ceramic water filters to create lasting health in areas troubled by unsafe drinking water. Using locally sustainable practices, the ceramic filters eliminate 100% of harmful bacteria, without the need for electricity or plumbing. \nSince the inception of the Foundation, Asia Transpacific Journeys has added to the foundation's outreach, supporting programs such as the Purkal Youth Development Society (aiding community development in North India), Save the Elephants (in Thailand), and its General Emergency Fund providing immediate relief for many areas, including, the devastating earthquakes in Nepal and flooding in Myanmar. \nTo read more about the Foundation's work abroad, or to donate visit www.AsiaTranspacificFoundation.org . \nAbout Asia Transpacific Journeys Asia Transpacific Journeys has been crafting private Custom Journeys and Small Group Trips to Asia and the Pacific since 1987.
