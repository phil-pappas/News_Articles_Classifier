Its lengthy but apt title: “Cowboys Indians Hobos Gamblers Patriots Tourists & Sunsets.”\nBut let’s take a step back and look at how all this came about.\nThe instant camera that appears bulky as it bounces off Hawkeye’s tummy when he walks was given to him by his father,<a href=\"http://www.aaronhuey.com\"> Aaron Huey</a>, a Seattle-based National Geographic photographer.\n<div id=\"tbd-ad-position-1-full\" class=\"tbd-ad-place-holder-full ad right medium-rect ad-inset\"></div> Aaron Huey’s work has taken him around the globe, to mountaintops, deserts, combat zones and many locations far off the beaten path. He’s known for his walk across America and his extended documenting of the Lakota Sioux of South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\n<div id=\"promo-left-small-mobile\" class=\"marketing-placeholder-small-mobile article-subscribe\"></div>Last year, he decided to take Hawkeye, then 4, on a four-day exploration of the area around Slab City, Calif., a remote desert oasis where “free spirits” soak up winter warmth in all manner of impromptu housing.\nHuey’s wife, Kristin Moore, was a bit nervous at first about her husband heading into strange environs with their then-only child. But she’s grown more comfortable as dad and son have taken on other adventures around the American West. (The couple since has produced a daughter, Juno.) \nHeading to that first adventure, Huey picked up the instant camera for his son. It has a minimal number of settings, and photographs that start to appear within a minute after the shot, good for kid-sized attention spans.\n<a class=\"ad-continue-link\" href=\"#ad-skip-1-small-mobile\" alt=\"Continue Reading Below\"><span class=\"triangle\"></span></a> <div id=\"tbd-ad-position-1-small-mobile\" class=\"tbd-ad-placeholder-small-mobile ad right medium-rect\"></div> <a class=\"ad-continue-stub\" id=\"ad-skip-1-small-mobile\"></a>Aaron Huey’s goal, he said, wasn’t to break Hawkeye into the photo business but to deepen the father-son bond. “An experiment in parenting,” he calls it. \nOn that trip, Aaron Huey took — and posted on National Geographic’s Instagram feed — the photo that launched the public fascination with his son.\n<div id=\"tbd-ad-position-2\" class=\"ad show-tablet show-desktop right medium-rect\"> <div id='div-gpt-ad-right2' class='dfp-ad dfp-right2'> <div class='ad-wrapper'> </div> </div> </div> In the frame, Hawkeye is holding the camera against his right hip and gazing intently, almost frowning, as he appears to be sizing up the target for his next shot. Goggles to shield him from desert dust are pushed up above his forehead.\n<div id=\"most-read-small-mobile\" class=\"most-read-placeholder-small-mobile\"></div>Not only did the online public bond with the little guy, it clamored to see what he produced.\nWhat he has produced, Aaron Huey said, is a “knee-high perspective of desert dwellers and tumbleweeds.” Scenes and faces. Pickup trucks and animals. It’s far from technical perfection, but it’s honest, direct and reflects a connection with people and places.\nSince then, the father and son have been on a half-dozen other adventures.\nThe online world has taken notice. Hawkeye has been named one of Rolling Stone’s top 100 Instagrammers, and Time magazine’s 50 Instagram accounts to follow. National Geographic Proof and the Huffington Post have highlighted his work.\nDespite the attention, Aaron Huey insists he isn’t a stage daddy promoting his son as a prodigy, a phenom or the next big thing.\n<div id=\"tbd-ad-position-3\" class=\"ad show-tablet show-desktop right medium-rect\"> <div id='div-gpt-ad-right3' class='dfp-ad dfp-right3'> <div class='ad-wrapper'> </div> </div> </div> Instead, what he’d like to encourage is “embracing the creativity and the vision of all children.”\nSome Hawkeye fans have speculated about the bright future the youngster might have in photography. But Aaron Huey said he’d prefer that his son take the lessons learned in photography — vision, creativity, connection and responsibility — and apply them to an interest he selects himself. \n“This boy is his own being, with his own ideas and his own path to follow,” said Aaron Huey, 39.\nIn the meantime, the Kickstarter campaign is steaming toward the $35,000 goal it needs to hit by Friday to make the book a reality. Donors can choose from a dozen support levels ranging from $5, which gets an invitation to the book-release party, to a $1,000 gift, rewarded with a one-hour portrait session — and ice cream.\n</div> <div class=\"extended-byline\"> <div class=\"single-byline\"><a href=\"https://instagram.com/argonautphoto/?hl=en\"></a>Jack Broom: 206-464-2222 or <a href=\"mailto:jbroom@seattletimes.com\" class=\"webonlylink\">jbroom@seattletimes.com</a>.</div> </div> <a class=\"social-share\"><i class=\"icon-facebook large\"></i></a> <a class=\"social-share\"><i class=\"icon-mail large\"></i></a> <a class=\"social-share\"><i class=\"icon-twitter large\"></i></a> \n</div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:12:43.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
