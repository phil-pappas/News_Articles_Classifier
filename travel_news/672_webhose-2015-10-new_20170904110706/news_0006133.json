In the third round of pool games several players stood out in Australia’s win over England. Michael Hooper and David Pocock were outstanding at the breakdown and elsewhere, while fly-half Bernard Foley’s flawless goal-kicking and all-round mastery of his team’s attacking armoury was a lesson for all aspiring No 10s. Julian Savea showed he is one of the most dangerous runners in world rugby with three tries in an otherwise uneven performance by New Zealand against Georgia. Lood de Jager on the charge against the US Lood de Jager, the South Africa lock, was mightily impressive in his side’s muscular win over Scotland. He got through a tremendous amount of work in the tight, and his tackling and ball-carrying added so much to the team effort. Ayumu Goromaru, the Japan full-back and my Liontrust hero of week one, gave another memorable performance in Japan’s win over Samoa, in particular with his positioning and kicking out of hand. Richie Gray battled hard against a dominant South Africa pack for Scotland and to be noticed when you are continually on the back foot is difficult. His line-out work against some of the world’s best operators was notable. Richie Gray looks for a way through In the end, recognition has to be given to the significance of the performance within the overall tournament context. Foley’s mastery put Australia in a position to win Pool A and erased the possibility of them not even getting to the knockout stages because of a missed bonus point against Fiji in their opening match. He orchestrated a varied and potent attack and was tactically first rate. Stand up Bernard Foley, my Liontrust hero of week three.
