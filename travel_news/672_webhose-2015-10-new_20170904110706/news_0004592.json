As the smallest country of Southern Africa, you can enjoy a wide range of adventure activities from the tree top canopy tour in Malolotaja Nature Reserve to caving the only major granite cave system known in Southern Africa.\nThe Malolotja zip wire is a heart-in-mouth experience that everyone should try. Situated in a gorge deep in the Malolotja Nature Reserve in northern Swaziland, 11 elevated forest platforms await. The lines begin slow and short to provide a slight taste of what is to come then gradually become more intense, ranging from fast to high (almost 80m off the ground!) to a shaky (but secure) suspension bridge over the Majolamba River. It can take up to 3 hours to complete, with exceptional views of scenery and fascinating wildlife. Baboon Rock is a favourite for tourists to see the baboons that frequently use it as their sunning spot.\nThis tree top canopy tour provides an opportunity to combine adrenaline with appreciation of the natural environment. As well as being a family friendly activity, the zip wire is also environmentally friendly. The lines go through the trees, rather than cutting them down, proving to have a minimal impact on the surroundings. The bases between each zip blend into the surroundings, offering a wonderful bird’s eye view of Malolotja gorge.\nFrom high up in the sky to deep underground, an 800m course of subterranean passages 90m below ground provide a unique cave system formed by the Kophola River that flows underground between Msunduza and Kophola mountains. This is the only major granite cave system known in Southern Africa, and comprises of a series of water-eroded chambers with names such as ‘Key Hole’, ‘French Connection’ and for the Harry Potter Fans, ‘Platform Nine and Three Quarters’. Progress through the caves is slow and strenuous but also exhilarating – with belly crawls, body jams and fluttering bats!\nSwaziland’s highlands, mountains and gorges offer opportunities to both climb and descend a number of rock faces.\nSwaziland has its fair share of offerings when it comes to an adrenaline rush, other examples include River Tubing down the beautiful Ngwempisi River, climbing and abseiling on Swaziland’s mountains and gorges, white water rafting on the Usutu river, Quad biking the ‘Devils Cauldron’, mountain biking with wildlife at the Milwane Wildlife Sanctuary or trekking at the largest exposed granite pluton in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:24:24.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
