It is crucial that the necessary raw materials reach production facilities and finished goods reach end-markets, cost effectively and efficiently to ensure smooth manufacturing operations. This directly impacts the logistics industry, with fleet owners investing in new equipment to serve growing demand. Road transportation is one of the most preferred modes of transportation for inland logistics. Rising demand for freight transportation, given the rise in manufacturing activity and global economic recovery, coupled with new structures of supply chain, has resulted in freight operators investing in expansion of their existing fleet.\nAsk of Brief Illustration of this Report: http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownload.asp?id=136867745\nCyclical Demand Pattern & Rising Demand for Fuel Efficiency\nFuel costs account for approximately 30% of the operating costs for fleet operators. OEMs are focusing on adopting new technologies, improving design, and using drag reduction components in new models. OEMs have developed components such as side skirts and drag reduction systems to reduce air resistance, improving fuel efficiency by up to 5%. For refrigerated semi-trailers, OEMs have increased thermal insulation efficiency to reduce energy usage. These advancements enable fleet operators to optimize operating costs and reduce harmful emissions from fuel consumption.\nGiven the lack of orders and a drop in the production activity during the economic recession, many fleet operators have started replacing older semi-trailers. The cyclical nature of the industry is currently at a stage of high-growth, as these vehicles are either being replaced or added for fleet expansion. Fleet operators prolonged purchase of new trailers during the economic recession and current market trends have resulted in investments in the expansion as well as replacement of fleet.\nBrowse related reports:\nTire Market for Automotive by Type (Radial, and Bias/Cross ply), Section Width (<200 mm, 200-230 mm, and >230 mm), Aspect Ratio (<60, 60-70, >70), Aftermarket (Radial, and Bias/Cross Ply); Vehicle Type and Region - Global Trends and Forecast to 2019\nhttp://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/automotive-tire-market-40166492.html\nBrakes Market for Friction Products by OE & Aftermarket (Brake Pads, Shoes, Lining, Rotor, Drum), Material type (Pads-Non Metallic, Semi-Metallic, Ceramic & Lining-Organic, Semi-Metallic & Synthetic) & Two-wheelers - Trends & Forecast to 2019\nhttp://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/automotive-brake-friction-product-market-35416213.html\nAbout MarketsandMarkets\nMarketsandMarkets is world's No. 2 firm in terms of annually published premium market research reports.
