No distress signal was received. \nThe plane was headed for Makassar, the provincial capital. It was carrying three crew and seven passengers, including three children, Barata said. \nA rescue team has been sent to search for the plane, owned by the private Aviastar Mandiri airline. \nAhmad Munir, head of the airport authority in Makassar, said satellite data showed the aircraft's last known position was about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from Masamba. \nIndonesia, a sprawling archipelago of nearly 250 million people, has been plagued by transportation accidents in recent years, including plane and train crashes and ferry sinkings. \nIt is one of Asia's most rapidly expanding airline markets, but is struggling to obtain qualified pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and modern airport technology.
