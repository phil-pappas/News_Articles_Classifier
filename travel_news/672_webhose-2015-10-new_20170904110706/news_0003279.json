By crowdsourcing and sharing advice across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram using the #SharingSafety hashtag, Michelin offers an additional resource for road safety.\nA new survey commissioned by Michelin finds:\nThe majority of drivers are confident in their own driving abilities (81 percent rank themselves highly), but 66 percent have felt unsafe when someone else was at the wheel. 3 in 4 (73 percent) have witnessed an accident or experienced a \"close call\" firsthand (76 percent), and 62 percent have been in an accident that someone else caused. 69 percent see other motorists ignoring safe-driving practices daily. Not surprisingly, 75 percent of drivers admit to \"offering advice from the other seat.\" The best sources of advice are still the tried-and-true: dad (selected by 52 percent), mom (32 percent) and driver's education instructors (27 percent). The driving advice people receive most frequently includes signaling before changing lanes (75 percent) and staying in the right lane unless you're passing (68 percent). Encouraging safe-driving behaviors with drivers of all ages can help improve road safety, yet this is particularly critical for America's youngest drivers. Car crashes remain the No. 1 killer of teens, with 2,614 teen drivers of passenger vehicles involved in fatal crashes in 2013, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\"We want to draw people into a national conversation about road safety during National Teen Driver Safety Week,\" said Pete Selleck , chairman and president of Michelin North America. \"Sharing even simple tips like how to maintain tires could mean the difference between life or death.\"\nThe campaign is the latest step in Michelin's ongoing efforts to increase awareness of road safety. A 2014 study by Michelin found significant gaps in teen road readiness, including tire-related safety knowledge and skills. To close current safety gaps in the U.S. driver's education curriculum, Michelin launched the Beyond the Driving Test campaign.

The study reached a national sample of 1,015 American adults ages 18 and older, weighted to ensure the results reflect the general population. The margin of error for the total sample is +/=3.0% at the 95 percent confidence level.\nAbout Michelin North America\nDedicated to the improvement of sustainable mobility, Michelin designs, manufactures and sells tires for every type of vehicle, including airplanes, automobiles, bicycles, earthmovers, farm equipment, heavy-duty trucks and motorcycles.
