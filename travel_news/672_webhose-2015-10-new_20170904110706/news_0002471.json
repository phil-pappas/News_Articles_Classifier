Ripmax imports drones and film memorabilia relating to well-known franchises such as Star Wars and X-Men , as well as radio-controlled cars and boats. It then distributes these gadgets to retailers around the UK, including Amazon. After securing the exclusive European distribution rights for the radio-controlled products made by Japanese manufacturer Futaba, 2015 may be Ripmax’s best festive season yet. The deal will significantly grow Ripmax’s revenues in the European market, and the dynamic SME is expecting to double its overall turnover over the next 18 months. Currently its revenues stand at £18.3m. Ambitious expansion can present cash flow challenges, however, which Ripmax managing director Nick Moss highlights. “As we have grown our business, we have had to become more creative with our cash flow. On the one side, when importing goods, we often find ourselves paying for them before they arrive in the UK. On the other side, when selling our products to retailers, it often takes up to 60 days to receive payment. This leaves a gap in our working capital.” A combination of invoice discounting and trade finance can prove invaluable to a business Fortunately Bibby Financial Services and Park Capital were at hand to provide Ripmax with £4m in funding, made up of invoice discounting and trade finance, to help close the business’s cash-flow gap. “We’re a growing and ambitious business,” says Mr Moss, “and we need a reliable funding partner, which is why we chose Bibby.” He adds: “Bibby offers both expertise in structuring working capital solutions and flexibility in relation to the amount of funding we want access to.” The importing and distribution nature of Ripmax’s business model also meant that the company had some very specific requirements for its funding. Jamie Gould, corporate manager at Bibby Financial Services, explains: “It was essential to provide the right type of funding that would cover Ripmax’s working capital needs.” Pointing out that business customs vary around the world, Mr Gould says: “In the case of Ripmax, many of its suppliers require upfront cash before they dispatch their products. This is different to the norm in the UK, where businesses often operate on credit terms.” He adds that in these situations “a combination of invoice discounting and trade finance can prove invaluable to a business, because it helps to ensure the two flows of cash meet in the middle.” • Read more about funding business growth at www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:46:06.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
