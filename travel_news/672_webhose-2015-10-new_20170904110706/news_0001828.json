Cobblestone streets, ancient landmarks, churches, museums -- Zona Colonial is the oldest permanent European settlement in the New World. The entire stunning area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On Sunday nights, though, the starring attraction is most definitely Grupo Bonye. In front of the ruins of San Francisco Monastery, the beloved local band plays a free concert under the stars to end the weekend. Read More Or kick off the work week, depending on your perspective. The band plays from 6-10 p.m., though crowds begin gathering nearer the official start time of 5 p.m. Singers Felix Baez, Nestor Sanchez, Chinese Mendez, Franklyn Soto and Roberto Bobadilla lead the ensemble (and occasional special guests) through a set of traditional Dominican meringue, salsa and son Cubano. A high point comes at 8 p.m. with a musical tribute to Dominican national heroes set to the song \"Quisqueya,\" with the entire crowd standing and a huge Dominican flag waving from center stage. Local fans advise arriving up to two hours before the music begins if you want to find a place to sit. Otherwise, you might as well just plan to dance all night. Plenty do.
