The Russian bride and French groom live in London, met in Massachusetts, married in Provence, and then honeymooned in Asia. Their August nuptials, attended by 275 guests, was a three-day affair that wove in various aspects of the couple’s heritage, from local French flora and cuisine to traditional Russian shawls for the ladies and—because it was, after all, a party—a dedicated table of vodka shots. The theme, in broad strokes, was the Ballets Russes—“such an important cultural moment, when France was really in love with Russia, and vice versa,” says Baibakova—and they built, sumptuously, from there.\nFollowing a January 6 engagement (FYI, for non-Russians, the date serves as their Christmas Eve), Baibakova went to Paris couture week with her girlfriends Nasiba Adilova and stylist Ekaterina Mukhina to assess the gown landscape. Enter Giambattista Valli , whose signature voluminous skirts capture the fanciful feeling of a ballerina’s tutu, perfect for the burgeoning wedding theme. “He’s an artist,” said the bride, “and I don’t use that word lightly!” The designer created two distinct and removable options for the bride, each to fit seamlessly over the same strapless bustier. Her showstopping ceremony gown was constructed of an incredible 300 meters of frothy tulle, and at each fitting Valli inserted still more layers in varying shades of white. “It was very challenging to get the color right,” says Baibakova, who ceded control early on. “I have to say, it was really his vision.” She worked with him for months on the dresses, which were delivered literally in the nick of time—July 31, the last day that Paris couture studios are open for the season.\nUltimately, of course, the multiple fittings and nail-biting over the color of the gown were completely worth it. Despite the challenge of the heavy skirt—“I kept knocking over my chair every time I got up for a toast!”—the bride kept the spectacular confection on through dinner. “I have zero complaints. I was very sad to take it off.” But the second skirt was literally made for dancing, so she wasn’t sad for long. A tea-length affair, this A-line, cream-tone skirt looked almost like spun sugar, and was covered with delicate three-dimensional anemones. “It was very light,” says Baibakova, “and at moments a little bit transparent.” Valli constructed it so that the length would look right with both heels and flats, guaranteeing that the bride wouldn’t have to stop dancing for even a moment.\nThe couple chose the stunning location, the historic Baumanière in Les Baux-de-Provence, having visited it last year for the groom’s 30th birthday. It fit with their desire to incorporate pieces of their heritage into the event—not only was the setting French, like Faure, but he used to visit Provence as a child. “It was a really natural choice,” said Baibakova, “like a homecoming.” Set into the picturesque rocky hillsides, the hotel hardly needed over-the-top embellishment, which is why they chose to work with Belgian florist Thierry Boutemy, who utilized local vegetation to create downy, moss-toned arrangements. Olive branches and herbs wove their way through lofty florals on the chuppah and altar. Debora Spar, the president of Barnard College, Baibakova’s alma mater, officiated, speaking of equal partnership and contemporary romance—values the couple try to espouse.\nAfter the ceremony, Baibakova’s mother offered the groom bread and salt, a traditional Russian gesture to welcome him to the bride’s family. “It was so special,” sighed Baibakova. “I loved every single moment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:59:38.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
