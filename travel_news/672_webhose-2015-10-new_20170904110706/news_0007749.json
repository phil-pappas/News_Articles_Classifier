New York, NY - infoZine - The Philippines Government has evacuated parts of the country at risk from the Typhoon, known locally as Lando, which as well as packing powerful winds is expected to sit semi-stationary above the country for up to three days, creating intense rainfall and potentially causing devastating flooding and tsunami like storm surges in coastal areas. Oxfam is ready to dispatch rapid assessment teams to survey the damage left in its path, and assess and respond to the greatest needs if the Philippines Government requests international assistance. The storm could be uniquely destructive because of the length of time it will hover over the disaster-prone country, which has experienced more than 15 typhoons this year alone. Oxfam Australia CEO Helen Szoke said the number one priority in responding to the disaster was determining the impact of the storm, and which areas had been hit hardest.

Typhoon Haiyan, which decimated the central region of the archipelago in 2013, killed more than 6300 people and forced 4 million people to leave their homes.
