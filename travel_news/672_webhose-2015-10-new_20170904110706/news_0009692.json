This will be facilitated by expanding private investments as well as a more open aviation regime. It also follows on the back of sustained tourism increases over the past few years – with officials saying that they are expecting at least 2 million tourists in 2015 which would represent a 30% growth from last year.\nThese figures could be seen as indicators of optimism for many – as tourism brings valuable revenue to the island as well as fuelling jobs and industries. Optimism in relation to the numbers suggests that Sri Lanka does have an enduring appeal for tourists and people are drawn to the unique culture of the area. Other aspects include attractions such as the national parks local cuisine and of course the geography of the area – with many beautiful small beaches typically popular with tourists.\nSri Lanka Visas were keen to comment on the news emphasizing that that this was only the beginning – and therefore much more positivity is in store for tourists.\n“Positive predictions regarding tourism in the area mean that faculties in the place are inevitability going to improve as a result. This will provide an ever-advancing infrastructure for tourism so for those thinking of visiting the time has perhaps never been riper. However if you are traveling to see the wonders of Sri Lanka from overseas it is important that you have all the necessary documentation including the appropriate Visa. This is a service we strive to provide here at Sri Lanka Visas; helping with the paperwork to make the tourism process as enjoyable as possible.”\nPR Contact\nJust Visas Ltd\n142 Buckingham Palace Road\nVictoria London\n\ninfo@visa2anywhere.co.uk\n02071189909\n \n\n\nAbout PRBuzz.com \nPRBuzz.com is a press release distribution service that distributes press releases to online news sites and blogs to help customers with search engine optimization and create buzz about their web site, news or business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:38:27.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
