National Airlines will fly this route year ´round. \nAfter investigating numerous options, National Airlines chose Orlando Sanford International Airport because of its exceptional service, proximity to local attractions, and the relatively smaller crowds and shorter lines that will minimize time in the airport, leaving guests more time to enjoy all that Florida has to offer. \nNational Airlines will also offer non-stop flights from Vancouver, British Columbia, (airport code YVR) and St. John´s, Newfoundland, (airport code YYT), to Orlando Sanford International Airport. Flights from these areas will take off mid-January 2016. Additionally, National will offer non-stops to Las Vegas, (airport code LAS), on December 27, 2015 and San Juan, Puerto Rico, (airport code SJU), on December 16, 2015. \nNational Airlines is in the National Air Cargo Holdings family of enterprises.
