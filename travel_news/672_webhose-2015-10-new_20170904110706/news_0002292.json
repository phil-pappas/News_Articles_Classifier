Speaking to TTGmice e-Weekly in Bangkok, Steven Dixon, TNZ’s regional manager South and South East Asia, said the search for the business events manager is still on and the imcumbent is expected to help the tourism bureau grow arrivals from Thailand by five per cent this financial year. \nHe pointed out that Thailand is a “recognisable market” and business from incentive travels is growing, although numbers are “under-reported”. To encourage more Thai business event planners choose New Zealand, TNZ will build on its existing relationship with key industry partners, including New Zealand Immigration and airlines to improve visa approval processes for Thai travellers. Dixon noted that there are currently three preferred agents in Thailand and they enjoy faster visa processing privileges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:58:05.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
