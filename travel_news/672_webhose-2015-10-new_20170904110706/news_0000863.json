The magazine’s annual Readers’ Choice Awards, now in their 28 th year, set the benchmark for luxury properties around the globe. 128,000 discerning American travellers took part in this year’s survey – the most in its history – submitting millions of ratings and tens of thousands of comments to choose the world’s best hotels, resorts, cities, islands, airlines and cruise lines. Hotels and resorts were rated on Rooms, Service, Food, Location, Design and Activities. Because of the range and depth of the survey and responses, the Readers’ Choice Awards are a unique and trusted source of travel advice respected around the world.\nOnly 270km from Cape Town, Bushmans Kloof Wilderness Reserve & Wellness Retreat is a haven of staggering beauty at the foothills of the Cederberg Mountains.
