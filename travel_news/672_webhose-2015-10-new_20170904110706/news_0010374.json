Whether old or new, strong cocktails, glamorous settings and beautiful scenery converge at these standout drinkeries located inside top hotels around the world. Connaught Bar, The Connaught (London) Read More Don't be fooled by mirrored ceilings and white marble floors. The Connaught's bar is elegant but not stuffy. The Connaught Hotel's signature bar is a triple threat: it's got killer cocktails, a prime London address and is an architectural marvel. With soaring mirrored ceilings, platinum silver walls and marble floors, the bar is upscale, without being uptight. Although a recent revamp brought a vast extension to the space, its drinks remain unchanged and as fine as ever. What to drink: The Martinez, the grandfather of the martini, which includes a blend of gin, vermouth, maraschino, orange and bitters. \nConnaught Bar , Carlos Place Mayfair, London W1K 2AL England; Carlos Place, Mayfair, London; +44 20 7499 7070 The Bar, The Merchant Hotel (Belfast, Northern Ireland) With its Baccarat chandeliers, antique fireplace, damask walls and Chesterfield armchairs, this Victorian-themed bar is one undoubtedly classy establishment.

Renowned mixologists and sommeliers make the bar more than deserving of its countless awards and accolades. What to drink: The Fog Cutter, a potent blend of cognac, rum, gin, sherry and citrus juices. \nThe Bar at The Merchant Hotel , 35-39 Waring St., Belfast Northern Ireland; 16 Skipper Street, Belfast; +44 28 9023 4888 New York Bar, Park Hyatt (Tokyo) Though famous for its \"Lost in Translation\" cameo, the New York Bar has more to offer than silver screen appeal. Located on the Park Hyatt's 52nd floor, it has breathtaking views over Shinjuku, with nightly jazz and a sophisticated yet cozy ambiance. The bar has a wine list of biblical proportions and an equally vast selection of local and imported liqueurs. Cocktails are inventive -- the Radio City is a blend of vodka, Earl Grey and pink pepper syrup. What to drink: A single malt Suntory Yamazaki, on the rocks. \nNew York Bar , 3-7-1-2 Nishishinjuku Park Hyatt Tokyo 52F, Shinjuku 163-1055 Tokyo Prefecture; 3-7-1-2 Nishi Shinjuku, Shinjuku-Ku, Tokyo; +81 3 5322 1234 Chandelier Bar, Cosmopolitan Las Vegas It doesn't get any more Vegas than this -- the bar is built to appear as a giant crystal chandelier, with each of its three individual \"tiers\" a glittering visual spectacle. On tier one, there's a DJ booth and dance floor. On tier two, there's a cocktail room serving artisanal pours. On the third tier, an exclusive lounge provides intimacy and privacy. Naturally, each tier has its own separate selection of cocktails, crafted specifically by a resident mixologist (the excellent Mariena Mercer as of this writing).

Its ultramodern deck -- made even more famous by its appearance in \"Hangover II\" -- offers giddying views of the city skyline and Chao Phraya river. Its centerpiece is a circular, glowing neon bar that serves potent but pricey drinks. You can easily find cheaper drinks a block away -- but they won't come with this view.

Though established in 1994, Jukkasjarvi's Icebar still remains a novelty and a great place. As its name suggests, everything in the bar is made of ice, from the furniture to the cocktail glasses. The bar was recently re-sculpted to appear as if an imaginary champagne bottle had exploded and splashed bubbly across all four walls. While the Icebar now has popular outposts in Stockholm, Oslo and London, the Jukkasjarvi version remains the most impressive and authentic. What to drink: Vodka shot. \nIcehotel , Marknadsvagen 63, Jukkasjarvi 981 91 Sweden; Hotel Twentyseven, Løngangstræde 27, Copenhagen, +45 7027 5627 Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel (New York) Dark and dapper, Bemelmans is arguably the city's most posh nightspot -- and has been since the 1930s. No detail has been left un-fancified: white-jacketed waiters, nickel-trimmed glass tables, chocolate-brown leather banquettes and a 24-karat gold leaf-covered ceiling. The most interesting aspect of Bemelmans may be the wall art by Ludwig Bemelmans, the creator of the Madeline books and the bar's namesake.

Cocktails are strong and spendy -- most guests opt for bottle service, which starts at €150 (cover charge is an additional €20). Despite its trendy crowd, the vibe is low-key -- there's no dance floor here, just a sprawling patio space for socializing and taking in the view. What to drink: A Cosmopolitan. \nThe Roof at ME Madrid , Plaza de Santa Ana 14 ME Madrid Reina Victoria, 28012 Madrid Spain; Plaza de Santa Ana, 14, Madrid; +34 91 7016000 Sky Yard, Drake Hotel (Toronto) Sky Yard is so on-trend it can barely keep up with itself: its theme, decor, art installations, music and drink menu change every few months. Its current most-requested cocktail is the the Salted Caramel Flip, a blend of rum, Calvados, salted caramel and egg. In summer, the garden-like space, lined with booths and daybeds, hosts indie film screenings, sing-alongs, art shows, clothing sales and bands.

Being the city's only rooftop bar, Level 8 is the ideal spot to watch the sun set over the Indian Ocean. Late at night, the space transforms into a cosmopolitan lounge, with live jazz and an international DJ every Saturday night. What to drink: A Bellini. \nHyatt Regency Dar es Salaam, The Kilimanjaro , Kivukoni Street PO Box 9574, Dar es Salaam Tanzania; Sokoine Drive, Dar es Salaam 9574, Tanzania; +255 0 22 213 1111 M Bar, Mandarin Oriental (Hong Kong) Located on the 25th floor of Hong Kong's Mandarin Oriental, M Bar is home to the best views in the city. There are M Bars in Boston and Miami, but its Hong Kong outpost is especially chic, with a lotus-shaped bar, charcoal velvet seating and timber lattice ceiling. Only in Hong Kong does the M Bar offer delicious dim sum from the Michelin-starred Man Wah restaurant next door. What to drink: The signature Hong Kong Legend, a blend of vodka, lychee, lime and cassia wine. \nM bar , 5 Connaught Road Central Central, Hong Kong; +852 2825 4002 The Library Bar, Central Hotel (Dublin) Behind the lobby of the Central Hotel in Dublin, the Library Bar feels like a secret hideaway. Inside you'll find comfy, worn couches, antique, overstuffed bookshelves and an atmosphere so hushed and intimate you'll want to whisper your drink order. In winter, a lit fireplace makes it the coziest bar in town -- and the best spot for a hot toddy. What to drink: An old fashioned. \nThe Library Bar at Central Hotel Dublin , Exchequer Street, Dublin Ireland; 1-5 Exchequer Street, Dublin; +353 (0)1 679 7302 Blue Bar, Taj Palace (New Delhi) Built on the perimeter of the Taj Palace, directly facing its quiet, sprawling gardens, Blue Bar is tranquil and hidden, yet still unmistakably hip. Shaded by giant bonsai trees, its timber al fresco deck leads into a stylish, Bohemian-inspired space with metallic black carpets and colorful furniture. The bar's formidable drink menu is a mix of crowd-pleasing staples and offbeat creations like the Khe San, made with herb-infused vodka and soy sauce. What to drink: Mum's Toddy, a mix of Cognac, bitters, lemon, ginger, honey and cloves. \nTaj Palace Hotel , Sardar Patel Marg, New Delhi 110021 India; Sardar Patel Marg, Diplometic Enclave, New Delhi; +91 11 2611 0202 Elephant Bar, NoMad Hotel (New York) Drinks just taste better when they come from behind such an elegant bar. Decked out in dark mahogany and leather, with a speakeasy feel, the Elephant Bar is one of the most handsome bars in New York. Award-winning mixologist Leo Robitschek expertly crafts drinks behind the elegant, 24-foot bar. The cocktail list changes seasonally but staples like the Manhattan are mainstays. The bar pays homage to New York's many microbrews with a hearty selection of local ales, including a custom beer created for the bar by Brooklyn Brewery. What to drink: Satan's Circus, a blend of rye, chili-infused Aperol, cherry liqeuer and lemon. \nThe NoMad Hotel , 1170 Broadway & 28th Street, New York City, NY 10001; 1170 Broadway, New York; +1 (212) 796-1500 Le Bar, Four Seasons Hotel George V (Paris) Though it's simply named Le Bar, there's nothing simple about this posh lounge in Paris' Four Seasons George V. With its dramatic chandeliers, mahogany walls and red velvet couches, Le Bar's grandeur is reminiscent of a bygone era. Cocktails are a mix of after-dinner classics and fresh, innovative drinks like rum mixed with grapefruit, grape juice and timut peppers. What to drink: The signature George Fizz, made with fresh strawberries, raspberries, guava juice and champagne. \nLe Bar at Four Seasons Hotel George V Paris , 31 Av George V 8th Arr., 75008 Paris France; 31 Avenue George V, Paris; +33 1 49 52 70 00 House Without a Key, Halekulani Hotel (Honolulu) Though it's located on Waikiki Beach, House Without a Key isn't a typical beach bar. Its ambiance is tranquil; every night, guests enjoy live ukulele music beneath the gently swaying branches of a sprawling kiawe tree. Drinks are on the classic side: mai tais and blue Hawaiians, but extra-strong, expertly crafted and beautifully garnished. The bar was immortalized by the Charlie Chan mystery, \"The House Without a Key,\" written in 1925 by Earl Derr Biggers during his time at the Halekulani. What to drink: The signature mai tai. \nHouse Without a Key , 2199 Kalia Rd.

Quite possibly the only true beach bar on Kauai's north shore and one of the best in Hawaii, Nalu Kai pairs barefoot appeal with strong drinks and views over Hanalei Bay, Pu'u Poa Beach and Bali Hai. Though the bar is part of the St. Regis Princeville Resort, it's more minimalist than posh. Cocktails are served with great flourish and made with the fresh juice of local fruit like lilikoi and lychee. What to drink: The Margarita El Fresco, infused with jalapeno and cilantro. \nNalu Kai Grill and Bar , at the St. Regis Princeville Hotel, Princeville, Kauai, HI; 5520 Ka Haku Road, Princeville, Kauai; +1 808 826 9644 Red2One, W Santiago (Santiago, Chile) Co-designed by New York's Tony Chi, you could easily be fooled into thinking this sleek rooftop bar is in Midtown Manhattan -- if it weren't for the views over the snow-capped Andes.

Throw in beautiful cocktails and A-list clientele, and you have the most exclusive bar in the city.
