Two recent announcements are of widespread interest:\n-- Norwegian announced that it will start flying nonstop from Boston to Copenhagen, London/Gatwick, and Oslo starting next May.\n-- WestJet is adding 767s to its fleet that will allow it to operate much longer routes than it can with 737s, and some of those routes will head to London/Gatwick.\nNorwegian, Europe's third largest low-fare airline, started featuring long-haul trips when it took delivery of its first 787, and it now has eight of the efficient and passenger-friendly planes. The new transatlantic flights will operate once or twice weekly on most routes. Norwegian offers two classes: an economy class that appears to be on a par with most of the competition, and a premium economy that provides better-than-average legroom along with the usual wider seats. Fares are highly variable, depending on season and seat demand, but the new Boston one-way fares will start at $215 to Oslo, $225 to Copenhagen and $299 to London. Another new service, Las Vegas to Copenhagen, starts in November.\nNorwegian is building an impressive base in Boston, from which it will fly to more European destinations than any other airline. It also flies from Boston to the French Caribbean. Although nonstops run to just the three Scandinavian gateways and London, Norwegian can connect from those points to cities throughout Europe. Obviously, it can't feed Boston departures from other U.S. points with its own flights, but travelers interested in catching Norwegian can fly to Boston on a handful of lines, including top-rated JetBlue, which has also built a major base in Boston. I wouldn't be surprised to see Norwegian make some kind of interline agreement with JetBlue.\nMeanwhile, north of the border, WestJet says it will start flying its new 767s from Calgary, Edmonton, St. John's, Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg to London/Gatwick this May. Introductory one-way fares will range from $199 Canadian (about $151 US) from St. John's to $C299 (about $US277) from the west.\nI find it somewhat strange that all of the recent innovation in transatlantic service has originated outside the U.S., at both the low end and for business class. WestJet, of course, is Canadian, and Norwegian and all-business-class pioneer laCompagnie are European. Odyssey, another all-business-class proposal, is also European. Azul has started flying from its home in Brazil to Florida. And although they aren't innovating any low-fare services, the big three Gulf lines are making heavy-handed pushes into transatlantic and world markets.\nMeanwhile, the last time I looked, web pages for wannabe U.S.-based startups Airline2.0, American West Jets, Avatar and Baltia are still making the same grandiose, low-fare promises they've been making for at least two years now, with no changes in sight. And you certainly don't see any innovations from the big U.S. lines. The only startup proposal over the last two years that has actually flown an airplane is Eastern, and it's doing only a few Florida to Cuba charters. I could see JetBlue as a transatlantic entrant. and Allegiant might do well to use its idle 757s for cheap seasonal weekly flights from smaller U.S. cities to Dublin, where travelers could pre-clear U.S. formalities. But neither line has shown any interest, at least so far.\nSo, for now, Canada is the active arena for low-fare action. WestJet will join -- and compete with -- longtime player Air Transat and the relative newcomer Rouge, Air Canada's in-house, low-fare operation. For several years, a few U.S. airlines have been getting fat on Canadians who are flocking across the border to take advantage of low U.S. fares. Why else would airports such as Fargo and Plattsburgh show such healthy passenger numbers? Will the scenario reverse direction, with U.S. travelers heading north for good deals? It's too early to say, but not too early to point out the possibility to bargain-hunting U.S. travelers.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins(at)mind.net.
