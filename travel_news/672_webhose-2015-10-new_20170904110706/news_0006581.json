To date ICAO and the air transport industry have been strongly united in their position against any proposals to use international aviation as a potential source for the mobilization of general revenues to finance climate programmes in other sectors.\n“Reliable air services are too fundamental to local and regional development priorities, and States must consistently be made aware of the negative impacts which aviation taxes and fees can have on their longer-term, broad-based and sustainable economic prosperity,” President Aliu commented. “Your active cooperation in conveying this message will be paramount leading to COP21.”\nIn 2010, world governments agreed to improve international civil aviation fuel efficiency by two per cent per year, while stabilizing the sector’s CO2 emissions at 2020 levels through a variety of measures, including technological and operational improvements, alternative fuels and a global market-based measure(MBM). ICAO’s State Action Plan initiative supports this work by identifying voluntary climate actions and fostering the partnerships and capacities needed to realize them.\nPresident Aliu also highlighted the importance of better communicating the substantial actions taken, and the progress being achieved by the sector in addressing aviation emissions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:12:41.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
