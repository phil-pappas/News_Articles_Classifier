Those willing to skip the busy holiday season may opt for the $849 Signature Pass, good all but Dec. 19-Jan 2.\nDisneyland also announced on Sunday that the $779 Premium passport is no longer available. Like the Signature Plus, it was good 365 days a year.\nAZCENTRAL\n46 things you (probably) don't know about Disneyland\nDisney officials said the new passes are intended to help alleviate crowds that pack the Southern California parks during the last two weeks of December. Officials have had to temporarily close gates due to crowded conditions.\n\"We continue to evolve the way we think about managing demand — particularly during our busiest seasons — in order to deliver a world-class experience for our guests,” Suzi Brown, Disneyland spokesperson, said in a statement. “In addition to continuing to expand, we are also exploring pricing options that could help spread out visitation throughout the year.”\nThere are reports that Disney is considering demand-based ticket pricing, adopting a model used by hotels and airlines. Visitors would pay more during peak times, such as summer weekends and the holiday season. Off-peak times — January and February, for example — would cost less.\nAZCENTRAL\nTop 10 Disneyland rides\nThe goal is to reduce crowds and lines, two things about which guests often complain.\nThe new Signature and Signature Plus annual passports come with perks including parking as well as dining and shopping discounts.\nStill available is the Disney Deluxe passport, good for 315 days per year, and Disney Premier, good at Disneyland Resort as well as Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. The Deluxe price rose to $599 from $549, and the Premier to $1,439 from $1,099.\nDisneyland raised prices on individual tickets in February. The one-day, one-park ticket rose $3, to $99 from $96.\nThe timing of the annual pass increase means those paying more will see less of the park after the holiday season.\nAZCENTRAL\nDisneyland sports a dazzling look for 60th anniversary\nFive attractions on the west side of Disneyland will suspend operations Jan. 10 when work starts on new 14-acre Star Wars Land, being built behind Frontierland.\nClosures include the Disneyland Railroad (all stations), Mark Twain Riverboat and Sailing Ship Columbia, Pirate’s Lair on Tom Sawyer Island and Davy Crockett Explorer Canoes. The “Fantasmic!” show will go dark.\nGone permanently will be Big Thunder Ranch, including the petting zoo and the barbecue restaurant.\nThe good news? Next year is a leap year, so that annual pass is good an extra day.\nDetails: disney.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/2015/07/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635723961086410388-IMG-3155.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/61f6dd69782df3b0047cf23c6eaa99aada693424/c=263-0-2663-2400/local/-/media/2015/07/17/Phoenix/Phoenix/635727260530532408-295-DLC-25.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a974fee44465ac6ef08fcb426ef8e75beed1fac0/c=295-1198-2097-3000/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635793019425212599-4-07-DL-1428A.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:38:15.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
