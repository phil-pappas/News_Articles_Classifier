Awards were presented across 15 categories following a rigorous judging process carried out by a panel of over 30 outstanding representatives with expertise from all facets of the industry. An additional category saw employees past and present voting for the ‘Best Venue To Work For’, with the Business Design Centre emerging victorious. \nThe London Venue Awards are organised by the Global Conference Network (GCN), who also run industry-leading awards programmes such as the Conference Awards and Association Excellence Awards. Rory Ross Russell, Co-Director of the GCN, comments: “We were overwhelmed by the volume and quality of the entries we received for these awards. We always knew that London was full of superb venues, but this is the first time they have really been given the recognition they deserve. “We would like to congratulate all the winners and commiserations to those that didn’t make it – picking victors certainly wasn’t an easy process! In some categories the decision was so close that we presented ‘Marks of Excellence’ to those that didn’t quite win. I’m already looking forward to seeing what the 2016 entries have to offer.” Full list of winners: Best Conference Venue – up to 300 delegates - 30 Euston Square Best New or Refurbished Venue - Banking Hall (Mark of Excellence to etc.venues - 155 Bishopsgate) Best Conference Venue – 300 to 600 delegates - Kings Place (Mark of Excellence to 8 Northumberland Avenue) Best Livery Hall - Stationers' Hall Best Event Venue – 600 to 1,600 attendees - The Brewery Best Board Room, Meeting or AGM Venue - 30 Euston Square Best Event Venue – over 1600 attendees - Lancaster London (Mark of Excellence to Barbican) Best Sporting Venue for Events - Emirates Stadium Best Unusual or Unique Venue – up to 200 attendees - ArcelorMittal Orbit (Mark of Excellence to The Roof Gardens) Best Catering at a Venue - ExCeL London and Leith’s at ExCeL Best Unusual or Unique Venue – over 200 attendees - Forman's Fish Island Best Business Club - St. James’s Hotel and Club Best Corporate Party Venue - Swan, Shakespeare’s Globe, The Underglobe (Mark of Excellence to Stamford Bridge) Best Awards Venue - Tobacco Dock Best Venue Customer Service - QEII Centre Best Venue to Work For - Business Design Centre Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:20:48.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
