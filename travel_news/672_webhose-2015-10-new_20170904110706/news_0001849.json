Crunchy quesadillas con chapulines is the house specialty at a popular restaurant in this drowsy postcard town. Hopper-chomping is not the culinary bell-ringer I had hoped, though, but more a white-bread attempt at the unusual in a place acclaimed for same.\nPeople come from all over to see, climb and soak up the vibes of the Peña de Bernal, the giant stone outcropping that juts suddenly from the high plains of Bernal, Querétaro, about an hour from the state’s capital. The towering peña looms stark, its craggy peaks home to flocks of ravens that wheel and dive at sunset.\nIt beckons trekkers of every age, and if you can make it halfway up the steep, rough-hewn trail, you will welcome the chapel, a perfect spot to fall down and rest, and between gasps thank your maker for air. After that, you will need climbing gear to reach the summit crowned with the tall white cross.\nThis soaring promontory is always mentioned — with the Rock of Gibraltar, the immense Pillar of Hercules overseeing the Strait of Gibraltar, and Sugarloaf Mountain at the mouth of the bay in Rio de Janeiro — as among the world’s tallest monoliths. The peña is the neck of an eons-old volcano whose obsidian is claimed to induce a feeling of well-being. It anchors one of Mexico’s designated magic towns recognized for their legends, history or beauty.\nThe leading legend places a gigantic crystal at the peña’s heart, but you can quickly get in the weeds as to what you see and don’t see in this tranquil slice of Mexico. UFO talk punctuates many of the tales, as do whispers of La Llorona, who wanders weeping for her dead sons, and of the comical ghost of Chucho el Roto, Querétaro’s Robin Hood who masquerades as nobility and then robs the rich for the poor.\nFrom the front of our open-air bus, guide Ramón slices and dices tourism truth as he points at the stair-stepping formations outlining the humongous rock that landmarks the town: “There is the tortuga (turtle) and the iguana. I guess if you have a good imagination, or a drink, it may be easier to see.”\nNot so smitten by the peña is Reuben Hernandez, who totes his 3-year-old son on his hip as they sell chocolate bars to raise money for computers at little Mario’s school. Unfazed by the adventurous zeal of those who would conquer the imposing rock, he laughs and says he doesn’t climb because he’s “too fat.” But he does buy into the idea that vibrations exist here that bring a gentle energy. “People are nicer,” he says simply.\nClinging to a hillside, Bernal is an understated jewel, gloriously lacking both traffic and traffic lights, and you come to relax and make your own fun, maybe shop for a fine woolen hat, vest, jacket or blankets. If you ask, the vendor at the Centro Artesanal will let you wander back into its cavernous workshop to see the mounds of wool, dyeing vats, spinning wheel and multiple looms.\nBernal holds in a lover’s embrace Chicago resident Fran Cotter, a former travel agent who’s visiting for the first time. She and traveling friend Mary host international students in their homes, and the father of a recent guest from Monterrey wanted to thank them with a vacation to Mexico. He chose Bernal.\n“When we pulled in, I thought this was one of the most picturesque towns I had ever visited,” Fran says. “Very few places I’ve been put me in such a calming state of mind. Only being in my favorite place, Cape Cod, brought me there until now. Here I could easily sit and do nothing but enjoy the space.”\nOn this Saturday evening, a four-wheeler competes for room on the stone-paved lane with a couple of teenage boys wearing big Mexican spurs, gigging spirited horses that spin sideways. Six girls chatter and charm atop another four-wheeler, two at the handlebars and four in the back seat. A bright red truck full of boys completes the raucous tableau, and the caravan rounds the corner every five minutes. It’s what passes for excitement in Bernal, and it’s not lost on Midwesterners fleeing a cold, wet winter.\n“Outside a restaurant, the women were preparing black gorditas, patties of black cornmeal with a pepper center, then you picked your stuffing,” Fran says. “We tried many gorditas, each one better than the next. I want the recipe. I can open my own stand and make a fortune in the right place in Chicago.\n“We walked through the town visiting the shops,” she adds. “Normally my reaction would be to haggle with the vendors, but here I felt no need to.”\nRestaurateur Claudio Brusadin moved his Piave Cucina Italiana with its delicious rabbit dish Coniglio in Salmi and other delicacies from Mexico City to answer the call of the peña. “It is said that people here live longer. Some say it is related to the peña, but I think it’s the way of living; people go to bed early,” he says. And most of the hotels have no TVs or phones.\nLike seemingly everyone who works and lives here, the peña holds Brusadin spellbound.\n“Every day the peña looks different — the colors and the clouds, one day a fog hat around the mountain. After the rain, it looks more colorful and washes away the dust.”\nBrusadin’s friend Carlos Martinez, who owns a crystal shop, reports fantastic events occurring at the spring equinox when crowds transform the town not unlike, one imagines, the famed happenings at the pyramids in Chichén Itzá.\n“Exactly at the time of the equinox a feathered snake [like Quetzalcóatl] appears, starting from the center of the peña reaching up to the sky, and the earth is fertilized by a myriad of bright sparks that flow down and up,” he says.\n“Also, spaceships appear, and some of them even cross the dimensional door in the peña. Once a crew wanted to record all these events, but their equipment just burned and did not work anymore.”\n“The magnetic field is what attracts UFOs,” says Martinez’s wise pal Brusadin, whose matter-of-fact analysis seems plausible. Or at least easier to swallow than grasshoppers in a flour tortilla.\nBill Sanderson is a Dallas freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:06:58.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
