The delegation has arrived in Abu Dhabi for the ANVR (Algemene Nederlandse Vereniging van Reisondernemingen) Dutch Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators Conference 2015.\nThe event is sponsored by Etihad Airways, which has provided return transportation from Amsterdam to Abu Dhabi, with all local arrangements organised by Hala Abu Dhabi, the airline’s destination management company. The conference attendees include the owners and management of the Netherlands’ leading travel agencies and tour operators, as well as professionals from related industries.\nThe aim of the this year’s conference is to showcase Abu Dhabi to Dutch travellers, who have historically ventured to all areas of the globe, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and to the country’s travel industry which is renowned for its professionalism and experience.\nDaniel Barranger, Etihad Airways’ Senior Vice President Sales, said: “I am delighted to welcome the leaders and key decision-makers of the Dutch travel industry here in Abu Dhabi. Etihad Airways places considerable importance to the Dutch market. Abu Dhabi as a destination is the ideal cultural and adventure holiday destination, providing year-round sun, a world-class tourism and conference infrastructure, and incredible leisure activities. It is also home to a leading airline which is setting new industry standards of superior service and innovation.\n“Moreover, Abu Dhabi sits at the crossroads of East and West, and Etihad Airways’ extensive global network, along with our Etihad Airways Partner airlines, provides the Dutch traveller with exciting stopover opportunities in the UAE, connecting onwards to the major leisure, cultural and business centres across Asia, Africa and Australasia.”\nIn 2014 and 2015, year to date, Etihad Airways has welcomed 130,000 guests on its services from Amsterdam.\nFounded on 17 February 1966, the aim of the ANVR is to combine the strength of its members in pursuit of their common social and economic interests, so that the organisation can play a prominent national and international role as the representative of the Dutch travel industry.\nThe ANVR’s policies are shaped by its members and the association’s governing body is the General Assembly of Members. Day-to-day management of the association is handled by an Executive Committee containing representatives from all branches of the industry including travel agents, air ticketing agents and tour operators.\nThe visiting delegation was welcomed at a dinner hosted by Etihad Airways at the Palm Garden of the iconic Yas Viceroy Hotel on Yas Island. The three day visit will include a tour of the important cultural and touristic landmarks of Abu Dhabi, an Etihad Airways sponsored lunch at the New York University’s Abu Dhabi campus, and a farewell gala dinner at the opulent Emirates Palace Hotel.\nAbu Dhabi has emerged as a world-class destination, built around a rich heritage and formed of over 200 islands, more than 400 km of pristine coastline, modern cityscapes, dramatic mountains and awe-inspiring deserts. Visitors to the emirate can explore former palaces, forts, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, one of the world’s largest mosques, and the Saadiyat Cultural District’s many museums, art galleries and performing arts centres, including the soon to be opened Guggenheim Abu Dhabi and the Louvre Abu Dhabi museums. Abu Dhabi also features some of the world’s leading beach and desert resorts and offers a wide range of sports and leisure activities, including its PGA certified golf courses.\nThe city is also fast becoming a leading sporting destination, hosting the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship, and the Formula One Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, held at the spectacular Yas Marina Circuit.\nEtihad Airways serves Amsterdam daily using modern Airbus A330 aircraft; a daily codeshare flight with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines complements these frequencies, resulting in two way connectivity to 22 Etihad Airways destinations beyond Abu Dhabi. Citizens of the Netherlands can obtain tourist visas on arrival at Abu Dhabi Airport.\nSource:- Etihad Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:05:34.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
