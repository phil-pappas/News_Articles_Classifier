Thome | Oct 14, 2015 eTN   \nSources close to British Airways have confirmed that the airline (once called ‘The World’s Favourite Airline’) will shift the handling of flights to Nairobi from the acclaimed Terminal 5 at Heathrow to the less fancied Terminal 3. \nWhile it was pointed out that the shift had been under consideration for some time, and that renovations had been carried out in Terminal 3, the risk is there for passengers to and from Nairobi nevertheless to feel downgraded in importance, a move which may cause unfavourable consequences for BA. \nAfter pulling out of Dar es Salaam – where Emirates promptly doubled their capacity – and more recently of Entebbe BA is viewed with more than just a degree of suspicion over its intent to keep their flights to Nairobi in place. No one in the travel industry spoken with in fact concealed the fact that few would be surprised if not the Kenyan capital, sooner or later, could too be axed. \nThe move to Terminal 3 is effective immediately and only 21 destinations from the entire global BA network will be served from the new location, including Nairobi, Accra and Cape Town. \nFollowing recent developments when Lufthansa announced a significant downscaling of their upcoming operation, compared to what Brussels Airlines used to be, from four to three flights per week and using a B737-700 aircraft instead of a wide body, more and more travelers and travel agents are viewing European legacy carriers with caution while shifting business to either the national airline of the Gulf giants, all of which serve Nairobi reliably and with often major service advantages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:47:36.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
