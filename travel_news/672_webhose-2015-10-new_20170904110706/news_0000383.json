Until the end of this year, the “Bedtime Stories” installation will be available as a mobile recording studio at the boarding gates of the two Lufthansa hubs in Frankfurt and Munich. In a speaker box designed in the shape of a moon, all parents can choose a bedtime story, record it directly and send it to their children at home via e-mail or text message. The children then only have to click on a link in the sent e-mail or text message, which directs them to the microsite. Here, the stories are available to download or to listen to directly. In this way, family members can feel at home for a few minutes, even when they are travelling.\n \nThanks to the support of renowned publishing companies, parents will have a large selection of popular children’s books to choose from. If time is short at the gate, there are pre-recorded stories to choose from, which can be sent home as audio books. Every recording can be personalized further with individually written goodnight wishes and a photo on the cover. Travellers can thus board their plane with the warm feeling that they have given their families a nice surprise. Many features of this unique service can also be used outside the airport. This is made possible by the microsite LH.com/bedtime-stories. Here, there are some very special bedtime stories: The famous German actor Axel Prahl reads aloud its favourite children’s books, a great surprise for the loved ones at home.\n \n“Travelling is always an emotional experience: Farewell and greeting, a change of place and culture, wanderlust and homesickness,” says Alexander Schlaubitz, Head of Marketing at Deutsche Lufthansa AG. We want to make every passenger feel as though they are in good hands. The new Bedtime Stories installation continues the series of innovative and surprising ideas for our passengers. Popular among our passengers are the already-introduced, specially-designed family desks with small steps for our little passengers, or the colour printers, with which airport guests can print out personalized greetings for arriving passengers.“\nThe individual campaigns are accompanied by traditional adverts, via the different social media channels and the Lufthansa Magazine Family. All personal stories about flying with Lufthansa have been posted on the microsite LH.com/lufthansa-stories. Here, employees provide detailed insights into their workplaces and provide a look behind the scenes. For example, the “Number of the Day” is designed to generate interest in informative and entertaining facts from the world of flying.\nSource:- Lufthansa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:38:26.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
