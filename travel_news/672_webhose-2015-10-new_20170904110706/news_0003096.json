It is an annual… more Trevor Brown, Jr. Denver is on pace to attract 11 percent fewer convention attendees this year than came to the Mile High City during its record year of 2014 — even though Visit Denver actually has scheduled more meetings and events this year. Richard Scharf , president and CEO of the convention and visitors bureau, revealed the numbers during Visit Denver’s annual meeting on Thursday. Visitors pile into the SIA Snow Show at the Colorado Convention Center. It is an annual… more Trevor Brown, Jr. He said the area is on pace to bring in 382,340 convention delegates who will pump $754 million into the local economy over the course of 764 meetings in 2015. The numbers are down slightly from last year, in which the city drew a record-high 429,497 conventioneers to 733 shows. The difference was that several of those conventions drew enormous crowds, from the roughly 18,000 people who came to the Custom Electronic Design & Installation Association show to the 12,000 who arrived in town for a National Education Association meeting. Because of the smaller shows, the total room nights that convention attendees have booked in downtown Denver hotels also is on pace to be down 5 percent from last year, Scharf said. But with increasing demand from business and leisure travelers, those same hotels are setting records this year for occupancy percentage, average daily rate and the all-important category of revenue per available room, he said. All in all, Visit Denver leaders are pleased with the year they have had, Scharf added. “This is the third-best year in terms of crowds,” he said. “We’re pleased because it’s competitive out there.” Ed Sealover covers government, health care, tourism, airlines, hospitality and restaurants for the Denver Business Journal and writes for the \"Capitol Business\" blog.
