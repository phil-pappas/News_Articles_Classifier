LOUIS , Oct. 21, This summer, Microsoft published a business case study about Enterprise Fleet Management's deployment of new Microsoft Surface Pro 3 devices to its entire North American sales team. These new devices provide even greater efficiency and mobility in the field, reinforcing Enterprise's industry leadership and longtime focus on providing customer service on a hyper-local level.\nWith a network of more than 50 fully-staffed offices, the company manages nearly 400,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada , providing local service to businesses, government agencies and organizations that don't have a dedicated fleet manager for their medium-sized fleets. Enterprise Fleet Management is an affiliate of Enterprise Holdings , the largest car rental company in the world.\n\"EFMFleetAccess\"\nIn addition to the Surface Pro 3, Enterprise Fleet Management is introducing an all-new online service called \" EFMFleetAccess .\" This new log-in website will provide customers immediate access to actionable information – including self-service capabilities, customizable reports, alerts and real-time data about fleet vehicles – on both mobile devices as well as desktop computers. Such key metrics will deliver an unprecedented level of information and transparency, providing customers precisely what they need to know to maximize the value of their fleet and to lower their \" total cost of ownership \".\n\"We have been partnering with Enterprise since 2002,\" Steve Williams , President and Chief Operating Officer at Herman Goldner, a full-service mechanical solutions provider, said in the Microsoft case study. \"The introduction of the Surface Pro 3 devices – as well as Enterprise's new website capabilities – represents a significant technological upgrade across the board.\"\nThe devices and new website capabilities are part of Enterprise Fleet Management's recent investment in information technology solutions to better serve customers – more than $100 million during the last several years. The company also has tripled its IT workforce.\n\"Enterprise has always been known for our operational expertise and excellent, local customer service,\" said President of Enterprise Fleet Management Steve Bloom . \"These technological investments are further enhancing our ability to help companies minimize their fleet expenses and strengthen their commitment to sustainable transportation, not only today, but also in tomorrow's marketplace.\"\nFleet Planning Toolkit\nEnterprise Fleet Management's forthcoming, Web-based Fleet Planning Toolkit will allow the Enterprise sales team to access multiple data points – including vehicle type, mileage, age and maintenance history – for a customer's entire fleet on the new Surface Pro 3 devices in real-time. Information collected will then be transformed into customizable analytics, allowing the sales team to provide customers with a complete picture of their total cost of ownership. Key features of the Fleet Planning Toolkit include:\nEstimated costs for all areas of fleet management (fuel, maintenance, taxes, etc.) to provide customers with a true total cost of ownership; Cost-going-forward models that help determine if a customer should stay in a vehicle for an additional period of time or replace the vehicle now, based on the total cost of ownership; Vehicle resale projections pinpointing the optimum time to retire a vehicle from the fleet; and Automated cost-analysis reporting that compares current vehicle operating expenses with other options and vehicle choices. Real-Time Maintenance Management\nEnterprise Fleet Management also is helping clients better manage maintenance costs through its new partnership with Auto Integrate , a web-based repair and maintenance authorization tool. Auto Integrate consolidates Enterprise Fleet Management's maintenance data into a centralized portal that is accessible to Enterprise Fleet Management's nearly 70,000 auto maintenance and repair shop partners.\nTechnicians first determine what repair or maintenance work needs to be done and then enter the vehicle's information into the Auto Integrate system. The technicians either receive immediate authorization to proceed or are prompted to call a hotline to consult with one of Enterprise's more-than-100 ASE-Certified mechanics to ensure any non-standard repairs and maintenance are justified.\nIn addition to streamlining authorizations for vehicle repairs and maintenance, Auto Integrate reduces billing issues and helps prevent customers from paying for unnecessary work. In fact, the Auto Integrate system contributed to saving Enterprise Fleet Management customers more than $18 million in 2014.\nFor more information about Enterprise Fleet Management, visit http://www.efleets.com or call toll free 1-877-23-FLEET.
