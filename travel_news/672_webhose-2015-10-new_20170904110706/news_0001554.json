The forest lodge is a quaint retreat that is sure to stir the soul of any nature lover. It boasts a well-maintained, rustically historic charm, yet includes all the modern amenities to make a vacation trip smooth and comfortable. The lodge first opened its doors to the public on the Fourth of July, 1914, and was founded by brothers Joe and Enos Mills, who were instrumental in establishing the famous 415-square mile Rocky Mountain National Park, whose border begins only twelve miles away. \nThe area, known as \"The Gateway to the Rockies,\" is largely unchanged from the wilderness of a hundred years ago with elk, deer, bighorn sheep, black bear, and other impressive wildlife roaming the backwoods. Especially adventurous travelers will be thrilled about the great variety of year-round activities they can choose from: skiing, sledding, and snowboarding in the winter; rock climbing, fishing, hiking, biking, and horseback riding during the warmer months. Water sports abound, with options for every preference, whether it's the thrill of water skiing, wakeboarding, or white water rafting -- or something a little more serene, like canoeing, kayaking, or simply float-tubing. Every member of the family can find something they'll love to do -- whether as a group or individually. \nWhile a rich paradise for the avid outdoorsperson, the town of Estes Park is also a visitor draw. Guests at Diamond Resorts International® The Historic Crags Lodge can enjoy a range of restaurants and shops as well as seasonal festivals that are rich with the region's cultural heritage. The lodge itself is a balance of affordable luxury and comfort with a choice of studios, one-, or two-bedrooms that include a queen-size bed, sleeper sofa, and a modern bathroom. Rooms feature a range of amenities including a fully equipped kitchen, flat screen TV with cable and DVD/VCR player.
