The increases and new rates are as follows: • the adult rate will increase by 20 pence to £6.70 per hour • the rate for 18- to 20-year-olds will increase by 17 pence to £5.30 per hour • the rate for 16- to 17-year-olds will increase by 8 pence to £3.87 per hour • the apprentice rate will increase by 57 pence to £3.30 per hour The increases this year represent the largest real-term increase since 2007, and of particular note is the rise in the rate paid to apprentices. The government is heavily committed to boosting the number of apprentices in the workplace, and this rate increase will possibly help encourage some younger apprentices onto schemes, as the gap between apprentice pay rates and the NMW for 16- to 17-year-olds has been significantly closed. Such a large increase in the adult rate is also significant, and is possibly driven by the impending introduction of the National Living Wage (NLW) from April 2016. From April next year employers will then be required to pay over-25-year-olds the NLW. Initially this rate will be set at £7.20 per hour, with a target that the figure will reach £9 or more per hour by 2020. The early adoption of the National Living Wage may well provide a useful recruitment boost to those organisations able to afford an early increase The National Living Wage will not replace the NMW, which will continue; the National Living Wage is effectively going to be a top-up payment for over-25s. Increases in the NMW have to be met by all employers and, while most organisations in the UK pay above the NMW, some sectors struggle more than others to meet such increases, and the NLW is likely to makes this struggle ever greater. In a reasonably vibrant economy, larger commercial enterprises can accommodate such increases by raising prices or driving economies through their business. Sectors such as the care homes, hospitality and farming have far less room for manoeuvre to absorb the increase, and there have been considerable fears raised about the impact of these changes in these sectors. The SME sector may also find these increases challenging to cope with, and we will have to wait to see if changes in corporation tax designed to help organisations adjust will ensure that growth within the SME sector is not adversely affected. Some larger companies in sectors where pay is traditionally around the NMW have started to use early payment of the NLW as a recruitment tool. Recruitment of good staff is always a challenge, and the early adoption of the NLW may well provide a useful recruitment boost to those organisations able to afford an early increase. • However legislation affects your business, one way to support it financially is with the right company car financed in the best way.
