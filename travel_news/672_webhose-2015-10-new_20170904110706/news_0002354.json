New data reveal more than 12,000 cases of distracted driving were recorded in a single hour this past week at 119 school intersections across the state.\nStudent researchers from 34 counties participated in Roadwatch-an annual observational and educational study funded by The Allstate Foundation and administered by the California Friday Night Live Partnership (CFNLP)-observing 12,569 cases of distracted driving, ranging from talking and texting on cellphones to eating and drinking, and reaching for items elsewhere in the car. These three driving distractions top the list as most prevalent.\nThe hourly average of more than 100 cases of distracted driving per intersection is consistent with the average recorded in all four prior Roadwatch studies. Traffic volume is not factored.\nDriven by a desire to improve traffic safety in neighborhoods and to use the research for future safe-driving initiatives in their communities, students compiled these startling statistics from among the vehicles they observed with both attentive and distracted drivers. The top distractions while driving are not surprising, yet each is avoidable.\n-\nCellphone use in-hand\n3,718\n31 - per hour/site\n-\nEating or drinking\n3,075\n25 - per hour/site\n-\nReaching across seat(s)\n1,290\n10 - per hour/site\n\"Reducing distractions while driving is something we all can do-it costs nothing and its savings are enormous,\" urges Phil Telgenhoff , field senior vice president of Allstate Insurance Company in California . \"When we drive safely, we improve the safety of everyone on the road.\"\nDistractions Defined\nMore than just cellphone use, distracted driving is categorized by California Highway Patrol as a range of activities that impact a driver's visual, auditory, physical or cognitive abilities when driving.\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving accounted for more than 3,300 U.S. traffic fatalities and 420,000 injuries in 2012. Despite laws and enforcement deterring the use of cellphones while driving, the CHP released a study this year revealing that nine percent of California drivers are seen using cellphones, an increase of 39 percent from 2014.\nCFNLP and The Allstate Foundation support the students' Roadwatch research to raise awareness among adult and teen drivers and all California communities about the importance of focused driving.\n\"Engaging California's young people like this encourages their positive and healthy development and empowers them to become active leaders,\" says Jim Kooler , administrator at CFNLP. \"Programs like our annual traffic safety summit and this Roadwatch allow California youths to lead their peers in reducing distracted driving collisions.\"\nNot Just Cellphones\nAdditional frequent driving distractions recorded by Roadwatch participants include:\n-\nPersonal Grooming\n1225\n10 - per hour/site\n-\nLoud Music\n653\n5 - per hour/site\n-\nAnimals on Lap/Dashboard\n487\n4 - per hour/site\nIn Fresno County , students observed one driver using his laptop and saw another driver with an open book propped on her steering wheel. In Santa Cruz County , students observed a driver's personal grooming nearly result in a rear-end collision while another driver there using a cellphone nearly hit a school bus. Here and in four other counties students reported drivers demonstrating two or more driving distractions simultaneously.\n\"Drivers like to eat breakfast and drink coffee in the morning,\" says a Friday Night Live researcher outside Templeton High School in San Luis Obispo County . \"It's scary to think we walk to school with this around us.\"\nFor the first time in Roadwatch history, students monitoring an intersection near Vanden High School in Solano County recorded no occurrence of distracted driving. The FNL advisor there attributes it to the school's location adjacent to Travis Air Force base.\nOne Roadwatch student researcher summed up this year's statewide observational study in simple terms, \"There are a lot of people doing unnecessary things while driving.\"\nActive in 54 counties statewide, CFNLP engages young people to become active leaders and resources in their communities.\nAbout The Allstate Foundation\nEstablished in 1952, The Allstate Foundation is an independent, charitable organization made possible by subsidiaries of The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL).
