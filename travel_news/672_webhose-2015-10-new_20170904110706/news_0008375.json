She has enjoyed a glittering career as a folk singer since the 1980s and since President Xi Jinping took office in 2013 she has attracted attention at home and abroad for her style and grace. She has been playing a major role in sharing Chinese culture with the world as well as in her country’s efforts to combat the spread of HIV and Aids and the stigma that surrounds the disease. During President Xi’s first state visit to the United States in late September, Ms Peng visited the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington DC with Michelle Obama. It is not the first time the First Lady has introduced Chinese culture to foreigners... Together they selected the name Beibei (meaning precious baby in Chinese) for a 5-week-old giant panda cub born in August. On Sept 28, she also visited The Julliard School where she watched students perform and coached a soprano in singing a Chinese folk song. This is not the first time Ms Peng has introduced Chinese culture to foreigners. Ms Peng views manuscripts by Beethoven and Mozart during her visit to The Juilliard School in New York in September.

The following summer she invited the wives of leaders attending the Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing to try their hand at Suzhou embroidery, helping to create a piece called Silk Road. She also led leaders’ wives on a tour of Beijing’s Summer Palace, an ancient royal landscape garden, during the Asia- Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting and took another contingent visiting in March for the Boao Economic Forum in south China to drink coffee and watch women making Li brocade, a textile produced by the Li ethnic group that has been recognised by Unesco as intangible cultural heritage. People can discover the beauty of Chinese culture through her dresses and through her ideas Promoting culture has been a major task for a first lady and Ms Peng was the perfect example, according to Ruan Zongze, vice-president of the China Institute of International Studies. “People can discover the beauty of Chinese culture through her dresses and through her ideas,” Mr Ruan said, adding that her image was one of “confidence and decency”. Ms Peng, who has been prepared for life in the media glare by a decades-long career as a singer, has also taken on the serious task of raising awareness of critical public health issues, including the prevention and treatment of HIV and Aids. She has actively taken part in campaigns to tackle the condition since 2006, when she paid a visit to children affected by HIV and Aids in eastern Anhui province. There she made three short films with the children, calling for better care and a guaranteed right to education. Ms Peng also visited a laboratory at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center focused on the development of a HIV vaccine during her stay in the US last month. In one of two speeches she delivered in English at the United Nations during President Xi’s visit she shared her experience in helping children affected with the virus and told the stories of two young people who had been able to live better lives thanks to medical treatment and the care of others. The fact she has extended care to the children will raise more awareness and help them “There’s no vaccine yet but our love can be just as powerful as any vaccine,” she said. Zhang Ying, chairman of the Fuyang Aids Orphan Salvation Association, a support organisation, said Ms Peng was well known to the public and much respected. “The fact she has been extending her care to the children will raise more awareness and bring more help to them,” she said.

First lady diplomacy is not a one-off. It should be a consistent effort.” Peng Liyuan and Michelle Obama unveil the panda cub's name at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington.
