Hide Caption 6 of 12 12 photos: Coffee shop in 1950s – The swanky European-style building was a social hub after the Great Hanshin Earthquake of 1995. Tokyo Station miraculously escaped damage. Hide Caption 7 of 12 12 photos: Dome views – Dome Side Rooms may not be the most luxurious rooms at Tokyo Station Hotel, but they're the most popular. The rooms offer views of the station's signature heavily ornamented European-style domes. Hide Caption 8 of 12 12 photos: Rare sight in Tokyo – Fully preserved during the last renovation, the yellow and white domes are decorated with intricate animal-shaped sculptures and reliefs -- a rare sight in modern Tokyo, where few buildings predate World War II. Hide Caption 9 of 12 12 photos: Unique contrast – Guests in the Dome Side Rooms experience a unique contrast between (surprisingly) quiet bedrooms and views of thousands of Japanese commuters beginning the day at Tokyo Station. Hide Caption 10 of 12 12 photos: People-watching – Tokyo Station is the busiest station in Japan in terms of number of trains per day (more than 3,000). About 350,000 passengers move through its turnstiles daily. Hide Caption 11 of 12 12 photos: High-tech fitness center and spa – Nominated in this year's World Luxury Spa Awards, the hotel's spa features a man-made hot spring, cold bath, a dry and steam sauna and shower facilities. Hide Caption 12 of 12 There's a more private way to experience the hotel's unique location -- staying in one of the Dome Side Rooms (starting at ¥46,000/$380). The rooms have windows looking into the station's interior -- with magnificent views of the station's signature heavily ornamented European-style domes. Fully preserved during the last renovation, the yellow and white domes are decorated with intricate animal-shaped sculptures and reliefs -- not an everyday sight in modern Tokyo. Fujisaki says the Dome Side Rooms are the most popular. Once the last train departs at night, guests get to be the only ones to enjoy the space. In the morning, guests are greeted by the unique contrast between the (surprisingly) quiet bedroom and the view of thousands of Japanese commuters beginning their day at the country's busiest station. Exclusive perks Rooms that don't have views of the station interior overlook either the train tracks or the Imperial Palace. Guests unable to get a Dome Side Room can still enjoy a similar view from the hotel's second-floor balcony. A cafe here serves coffee, Japanese green tea and small meals. Overnight hotel guests get another exclusive perk -- breakfast at The Atrium under the roof of Tokyo Station. The elegant space is housed on the fourth floor of the hotel with nine-meter-high ceilings. The buffet menu includes both international and Japanese fare -- French pastries, Japanese porridge, made-to-order omelets. Japan's legendary bartender Hisashi Sugimoto, who joined the hotel's Bar Oak in 1958, has returned with his hugely popular signature drink, Tokyo Station, a a blend of Tanqueray gin and Suze liqueur. Commuter-friendly The hotel's main attraction remains its unmatched proximity to Japan's extensive high-speed rail network. The hotel offers special rates to Japan Rail Pass holders. It provides a meet-and-greet service where hotel porters pick up or drop off guests' luggage directly on the train platform, saving them from trying to navigate Tokyo's notoriously complex rail station. To celebrate: You're too late to join the hotel's 100th birthday banquet if you don't already have a ticket -- the 120 seats sold out in 20 minutes. But you can see the anniversary light show beamed from the roofs of the Marunouchi Building's north and south domes on November 2 from 6 to 9 p.m. \nThe Tokyo Station Hotel , 1-9-1 Marunouchi, Chiyoda 100-0005 Tokyo Prefecture; <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from CNN Travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:13:38.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
