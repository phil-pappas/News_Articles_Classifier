Put on the correct nutritional diet, and a strength and conditioning program of lifting weights and running, his physique was transformed over a 12-month period with a personal trainer, losing 11 kgs. The programme was underwritten by his father Rick. Those 12 months may have been the turning point in his athletic career. Rick Corbisiero writes: When Alex decided playing rugby professionally was something he wanted to do, I just said, \"Son, whatever you decide to do, make sure you do it well.\" When he was about 16, we hired Ben Stork, who was an ex-professional rugby player from Harlequins who'd retired due to knee injuries. Ben taught Alex the fundamentals of running, lifting weights and eating correctly. That was a good base for when he went into the [London Irish] academy. It was a big commitment. Parents don't mind investing if the child responds positively to it and embraces it Personal trainers aren't cheap and when you're not with an academy or a club, you've got to pay for it yourself. Alex committed his time. It was three times a week nutrition and up to four times a week physio – which you need when you’re training four times a week. Parents don't mind investing if the child responds positively to it and embraces it. He did embrace it. In one year he just completely changed. He was playing for London Irish, he was in the London Irish academy and he was playing for the school. So he was playing five days a week and games on the weekend. He was pretty much immersed in it. When you're a rugby player , your body is your toolbox. You go through a period where a lot of the coaches want to win the age-group games, so they go with the small, fast kids. Then you're sort of on the outside as a big kid, but you know you're gaining on them because you're getting fitter and fitter by the day. Then all of a sudden you're as fit as they are, but twice the size. I remember the day we knew Alex was getting to be a very big man . He went to Colorado to stay with a friend and missed his flight home because there was a long queue. I asked to speak to someone on the desk at the airport and told the lady, \"You're responsible for him, he's a minor.\" The lady said, \"This kid's no minor.\" Then she checked his passport and they got him on the next flight home. In that moment in Alex's rugby development, we had nobody to back us. When Alex was first at the academy they wouldn't even give academy kids supplements. There was no budget for it. A lot of the younger kids, like Danny Cipriani, you'd never play against them because they were perceived to be such a league above you. They had all these resources thrown at them, we didn't have anything. We didn't care. We said, we'll do it our own way. That's basically what we did. Shape of things: Alex's weight and measurements chart when he was 16 Alex Corbisiero adds: We took on the trainer after I didn't make the Surrey Under-16s. A lot of the under-16s guys then get picked up by academies, where they do weights and conditioning and diet and all the things that help you take the next step towards developing. I missed out on that window. So my dad took it upon himself to find a trainer, a guy who had worked in rugby before and was well renowned in the area. I can't thank him enough for that. I remember at the time being a little resistant in some ways because it was hard work. I wanted to achieve and get better but I hadn't realised just how big a commitment it was. There would be times when I would be tired or didn't want to go. I'd look at dad and he'd be like, \"Go on, go.\" Looking back, it was the best thing to ever happen to me. I learnt a lot of the fundamentals of eating, diet, strength, and I changed my body completely. I think I grew another three or four inches in height over the same period. My schoolmates noticed the change. Finally I was able to turn my big frame and size into much more of an athletic build I was always a big, heavy, chunky kid and finally I was able to turn that big frame and size into much more of an athletic build. It gave me a lot more confidence on and off the rugby field. It changed the way I carried myself. It helped with friends and also girls as I got older. It was a great foundation for me going forward. I enjoyed it, but if you go to school and you're training rugby four or five days a week, playing two games a week, then going to the gym four times a week... it was tough. At times you'd stray away from the path a little bit. My dad and Ben Stork had made a big commitment and I owed it to them to fulfil my end of the bargain. By the time I got to 17 or 18 I realised how important it was. I finally did get picked up by London Irish, and I wasn't behind the guys who had been there since they were 14 and 15 who had been drafted in from Wellington or Whitgift schools. I was very fortunate to have that foundation. I don't think I would have got picked up or been noticed without that. I think I was very lucky to have the family around me that I do. I've got a lot of support and commitment from my dad. It's probably on a list of ten million things he's done for me that I'll be eternally grateful for. Hopefully one day when I have a family and kids I'll be able to do the same for them. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:38:22.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
