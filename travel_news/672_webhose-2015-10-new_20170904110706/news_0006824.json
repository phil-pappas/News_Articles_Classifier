She said: “What sets us apart is the expertise of our team. Instead of mobilizing internal staff to run the business, we invested into a wedding planning company and leverage on their professionalism as well as resources. \n\n“We’re planning to have three to five wedding concept stores up in next six months and the first one will be situated in Central,” added Ko. \n\nAccording to her, both overseas photography and wedding trips showed a similar pace of growth. “Seoul is the most popular destination among overseas pre-wedding photography packages while Bali, Okinawa and Guam remain hot for weddings,” she said. \n\nThe brand is currently positioned to tap mid to upscale clients, in both local and overseas markets. “In fact, both markets complement each other. I had a client who staged a small overseas wedding but later realised the need to celebrate with friends and siblings back in Hong Kong,” said Tim Lau, general manager of Take My Hand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:12:58.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
