They did processions around the church,” Mendoza recalled. \nThe church in the Quechula locality, in the south of the country was built by a group of monks headed by Friar Bartolome de la Casas, who arrived in the region in the mid-16th century. \nThe church is 61 metres long and 14 metres wide, with walls rising 10 metres. \nThe bell tower reaches 16 metres above the ground. \n“The church was abandoned due the big plagues of 1773-1776,” said architect Carlos Navarete, who worked with Mexican authorities on a report about the structure.

Navarrete believes that based on architectural similarities, it is the work of the same builder at very nearly the same time. \n“It was a church built thinking that this could be a great population centre, but it never achieved that,” Navarrete said. \n“It probably never even had a dedicated priest, only receiving visits from those from Tecpatan.” Local fisherman Leonel Mendoza has been ferrying tourists out to see the ruins.
