The dramatic increase is the result of an ongoing sales initiative that has seen the commercial team engage with 65% more new conferences than in 2014.Contributing to the impressive increase in business is a raft of new events to the space. The international European Middle Eastern and African Society for Biopreservation and Biobanking (ESBB) Conference took place from 29th September – 2nd October welcoming specialists from across the globe. \nThis is the first time the peripatetic event has taken place in London and previous host cities include Leipzig, Verona, Grenada and Marseille. In the ESBB Vendor Survey carried out last year, London was ranked the number one conference destination in the EMEA region, which influenced the choice of destination for its 2015 conference. Just a few days later the space was transformed once again to welcome the Ground Engineering Basements and Underground Structures Conference which moves to Olympia London from Central Hall, Westminster. The Olympia London outing marked its eighth year and welcomed more than 200 attendees to explore the procurement, design and delivery of underground spaces. “Olympia London is continuing to welcome both domestic and international business from new and emerging markets and we’re delighted to see so many events choosing our versatile space to showcase their products and services. The conference centre has been recently refreshed and we’re delighted to see it go from strength to strength,” said Gillian Kiamil, Olympia London Venue Director. The venue is set to welcome even more new conference business in the coming months. Events in 2015 include the Family Travel Show, Packaging News Live and Management in Practice.
