Looks like @uconn did the right thing and expelled him,” tweeted @YoungJands .\nThe drunk Bacon Mac and Cheese Bro has officially left the UConn campus http://t.co/uRdWaWA0WO pic.twitter.com/S2e6gu2xY0\n— Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) October 7, 2015\nWARNING: GRAPHIC LANGUAGE\nCampus officials refused to comment about the 19-year-old’s student status, citing federal privacy laws.\n“Generally speaking, any UConn student found to have violated the provisions of the Student Code may face penalties imposed by the Division of Student Affairs that range from probation to expulsion,” a university spokesman told The Hartford Courant .\nHis dinner request — where he demands some “f***ing jalapeno bacon mac and cheese” from a campus cafeteria worker — went viral with more than 2.7 million views.\nLuke Gatti. Source: AP\nThe original video has since been taken down due to a copyright claim.\nGatti had been trying to buy the mac and cheese at the university’s student union in Storrs. Police and the manager say he was refused service because he had an open alcohol container.\nThe nine-minute clip shows Gatti throwing a temper tantrum when a dining hall employee, whom he calls a “f***ing idiot,” denies his mac and cheese request.\nThe video shows Gatti arguing with and shoving the manager before being tackled by another employee, being arrested by police and spitting at the manager before being led away.\nGatti, of Bayville, New York, was charged with breaching the peace and criminal trespassing on Sunday evening. He is due back in court October 13.\nHe transferred to UConn from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, where he was arrested twice in 2014 for disorderly conduct and assaulting a police officer, records show.\nThis article originally appeared on New York Post and was reproduced with permission.\nOriginally published as Bad news for mac and cheese kid", "external_links": ["http://t.co/S2e6gu2xY0", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/06/college-bro-arrested-over-mac-and-cheese-rant-at-food-court/", "https://twitter.com/barstoolsports/status/651753946118291456", "http://t.co/uRdWaWA0WO", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/09/1227563/413800-c7c3ab64-6e19-11e5-8252-216a34f84008.jpg", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/08/mac-and-cheese-jackass-apparently-kicked-out-of-college/", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/mac-and-cheese-jackass-luke-gatti-apparently-kicked-out-of-college/story-fnkgbb3b-1227563414493", "https://twitter.com/YoungJands/status/651552315615219713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.courant.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovD178AhhSc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAHgk6M22D8"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:58:10.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
