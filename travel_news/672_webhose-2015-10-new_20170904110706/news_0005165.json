I know that look. I've been there before. They were praying en masse not to be seated by us. I couldn't blame them as I prepared to fly to London with an unruly one-year-old. \nI had researched what to expect. \"Flying with a baby is child abuse,\" I read online. \n\"Drug him,\" a parent-friend advised. \n\"Drug yourself,\" another said. \nBooking the flight with an infant had seemed like a good idea, especially as under-twos fly free. There was a wedding to attend, friends to see, and the disappointment of an English summer. And we got to learn first-hand the misery of long-distance travel with a child. \nDO YOUR RESEARCH \nThe bassinet seat is the golden ticket. It's not just the cot, but the extra leg-room for tummy time or playtime. Always check the airline's policy on bassinets. Some airlines charge you to pre-book the seat, while others offer it free. Weight and age limits also vary. Babies under eight-months get precedence on Air New Zealand while you can reserve a bassinet for a two-year-old on British Airways. \nAlso research stopovers. Singapore Airport won our vote with a playground and butterfly garden. \nSLEEPING \nAfter a 12-hour flight with no sleep I discovered my son projectile vomits when over-tired. We were on the fourth change of clothes when we went back to his original outfit since it was the least foul-smelling. \nYet on another flight he slept 10-hours and everyone exclaimed \"what an angel\". \nWhether your child sleeps depends on age, time, mood and luck. A child is more likely to sleep on night-time flights, but it can backfire on you if the baby refuses and everyone ends up exhausted. \nPack the pyjamas, sleepsuit and cuddle toy and follow your normal routine. The younger the child, the better because a plane's engine is the perfect white noise. Wish for turbulence - it's like a rocking chair in the sky. \nKEEP THEM ENTERTAINED \nPack several new, small toys and bring a one out every few hours. Think miniature playdough, slinky, and squishy toys. If the child is old enough a video or game on a tablet or screen may offer solace. \nFor babies eating solids bring food that is slow to eat (raisins, rusks, and biscuits). \nMake use of the plane. Some planes have space at the back for a crawler or walker to burn energy. \nIndestructible vomit bags make good play things while drinking cups are great for stacking. \nREAD MORE: \n*Girl reunited with teddy thanks to kind airport staff \nTAG-TEAM \nTrying to both juggle a child's needs could mean divorce proceedings by the end of a 24-hour journey. Take 90 minute shifts with your partner so you each get sanity breaks. \nRequest meals to be brought separately so you can take turns eating while the other person holds the child. If you're alone with a child, desperately hope to be seated by a caring soul who holds the baby while you eat. If you are alone with multiple children, expect to be a miracle worker. \nDON'T FEEL GUILTY \nDo what you must to survive. Feed them sugar, breastfeed or bottle-feed them to sleep. Ignore the expert advice and shove a screen in front of them if it works. Take all help that's offered. \nPACK SMARTLY \nYou only have one chance to get this right. Here's my essentials: \nFluid: boobs and/or formula powder. \nThree changes of baby clothes (minimum) and one for yourself. \nNappies and wet wipes. Account for delays and air pressure messing with a baby's bowel. \nFacecloth for heavy-duty spills like vomit. \nMedication including pamol and teething remedies. \nFavourite item: blanket, dummy, book or cuddle toy. \nBibs, bowl and cutlery. \nResealable bags to put dirty items into. \nA few lightweight toys. \nEar popping aids: breastfeeding, bottle, dummy or suckable food pouch. \nBaby food. You can prebook infant meals but they don't always turn up. \nMuslin wrap to be used to block light or as a blanket. \nWhat are your tips for flying with an infant?
