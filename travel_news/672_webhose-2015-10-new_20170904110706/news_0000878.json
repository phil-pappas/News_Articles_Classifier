Although Japan now go home, despite winning three pool games out of four, the World Cup has been enriched by their presence. And even with the knockout stages to come, you can make a case for Goromaru being the most consistent player of the tournament. Control of territory and good decision-making guided Ireland to a comfortable win Greig Laidlaw, the Scotland scrum-half and captain, was at his best against Samoa and not just with his reliable kicking. Tactical astuteness, in a frenetic game, was topped off with a decisive try as Scotland beat Japan to the runners-up slot in Pool B. Scotland’s tight-head prop Willem Nel also played a key role. He has been consistently good and,his work in the tight has stabilised his team and let them play. Keeping your head: Scott Fardy worked well under intense pressure While we are looking at the front row it’s right to pick out Argentina hooker Julián Montoya. Part of a traditionally strong scrum, Montoya is also mobile and a good ball carrier. His try against Namibia topped off a fine overall performance. You could pick out any number of Australians for their indomitable defence against Wales. Kane Douglas and Scott Fardy got through a prodigious amount of work when the pressure was at its most intense. Sean O’Brien, the Ireland flanker, would probably have got this week’s award for his constant presence at the breakdown against France, where he was superb. Unfortunately getting banned for a week has to be weighed against the positives and so the Liontrust hero of week four goes to a team-mate. When Johnny Sexton went off you wondered if Ireland would be able to cope. But Ian Madigan’s introduction actually made them look more dangerous and he marshalled his midfield superbly. Control of territory and good decision-making guided Ireland to a comfortable win. Ask the experts Liontrust is a specialist fund management group that takes pride in its distinct culture.
