File photo Article Airports, Airlines & Security \nThe news keeps getting better for Canadian travellers who want to explore the planet. \nWestJet has been steadily increasing its offerings. The Calgary-based airline recently announced they will be flying to London’s Gatwick Airport from five Canadian cities (Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto and St. John’s) starting May 2016. The airline already flies to Dublin from St. John’s. \nAir Canada rouge , which bills itself as a leisure carrier and does not have the same comfort level or service offerings as Air Canada, will start flying from Toronto to London Gatwick on May 19, with flights up to seven times a week. A new Air Canada non-stop from Montreal to Lyon, France starts the month after that. DEAL OF THE WEEK Air Canada has launched a Thanksgiving sale on tickets to a variety of destinations in Canada, the U.S., Europe and other places. Advertised specials include Toronto-Quebec City one-way for $141, Toronto-Tokyo round-trip for $962 and Toronto-Dublin return for $603. Other deals include Vancouver-Barcelona for $922 return, Calgary-Cancun for $323 one-way and Montreal-Paris for $702 return The sale is on until Oct. 13, 2016. DESTINATION OF THE WEEK Kauai might be the most Hawaiian island of them. It’s almost certainly the most beautiful, with the rugged Na Pali cliffs and deep folds and valleys and stunning views of Waimea Canyon, sometimes called the Grand Canyon of the Pacific. The north coast around Hanalei looks like Tahiti with its wide bays and spiky mountain views and the broad Hanalei River valley laced with taro fields. On the west side, broad Poipu Beach offers fabulous resorts and great body surfing. The nearby town of Hanapape is a sleepy, artsy village with what’s billed as the southernmost book store in the United States. Check out Kukui O’Lono golf course for the best deal on the islands: $12 CDN to play all day on a funky course with average conditions, but killer views. Now is a good time to go to Hawaii as prices usually start to rise as we edge closer to winter. \nOn top of all that, word came down last week that Iceland-based Wow Airlines will start flying from Toronto and Montreal to Reykjavik, Iceland in May 2016, with fares starting at $99 CDN one-way including tax. For another $149 one-way, also including tax, folks will be able to fly from Iceland to several cities in Europe, including Paris, London, Berlin, Rome, Barcelona and Copenhagen. \nPorter Airlines announced it will start its service between Toronto and Myrtle Beach on Feb. 11, 2016. There are flights up to five times a week and daily flights during March Break. The flights will run until May 23. Porter also announced flights to Florida for the first time. From Dec. 19 to April 30, 2016, Porter will offer weekly, non-stop flights between Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport and Orlando-Melbourne International Airport, which is about 90 minutes from Walt Disney World and just 10 minutes from the beach. Introductory prices were set at $392 CDN for a round-trip ticket. \nMeanwhile, National Airlines will start flying from Windsor, Ont. to Orlando-Sanford Airport starting Dec. 17, 2016. For Orlando fans out west, National also announced flights from Vancouver to Orlando-Melbourne, starting Jan. 20, 2016. \nPrices for all flights vary, so check online or call the airlines to find the best deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:21:46.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
