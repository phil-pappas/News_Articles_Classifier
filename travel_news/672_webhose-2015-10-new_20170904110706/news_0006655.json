He also has extensive experience in hotel pre-openings, launching high profile properties in key gateway destinations such as Seoul, Dubai and Abu Dhabi; as well as a track record in defining and implanting successful sales and marketing strategies for leading and upcoming brands. \n“Dushan’s e-distribution and revenue knowledge combined with Roddy’s expansive industry experience and reputation in the region will be a fantastic foundation for TIME Hotels’ to consolidate our strategy and capitalise on new potential areas of revenue enhancement and market penetration,” remarked Awadalla. \nGunarathna joins the team from another home-grown brand, Rotana Hotels, where he fast tracked his career path, progressing from reservations agent to area e-distribution manager, with responsibility for 27 properties, in just five years. \n“I am delighted to be joining Time Hotels and look forward to embracing this unique culture, and putting our global customer relationships at the heart of our sales and marketing direction, as we continue to grow our team capabilities and access new and exciting opportunities,” said Gordon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:59:01.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
