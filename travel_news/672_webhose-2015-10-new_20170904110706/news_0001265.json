As each month passes, the Comfort Inn and Comfort Suites brands, which are franchised by Choice Hotels International, Inc. one of the world’s leading hotel companies, are sustaining peak levels of overall guest satisfaction scores and heightened developer interest. This energized momentum is largely being fueled by the now steady stream of freshly built new prototype hotels opening their doors in the past year, more existing properties unveiling modern renovations, the introduction of appealing new brand programs, and the departure from the system of hundreds of hotels that don’t fit the direction of the portfolio.\n“The franchisees who were early believers and early adopters of our sweeping and aggressive changes for the Comfort brand are helping to drive the favorable results we are seeing already,” said Anne Smith, vice president of brand strategy for Choice Hotels. “Their actions and positive word of mouth coupled with improvements in the economy really propelled this positive change for the Comfort brand way ahead of schedule.”\nREAPING THE REWARDS\nApproximately 300 hotels that took advantage of Choice Hotels’ landmark $40 million dollar Comfort brand property improvement incentive offered in May 2013, and invested close to $250MM in total, are now enjoying the fruits of their efforts. In aggregate, those hotels are experiencing incremental RevPAR gains that are, on average, 5% higher than non-participating hotels. Many of the hotels that renovated earliest have been able to capitalize on the strong lodging cycle and are experiencing even higher lifts.\nDRIVING DEVELOPMENT AND OPENING DOORS\nWith regard to franchise development, year to date the Comfort brand is experiencing an accelerated pace of new agreements, up 92-percent at the end of the second quarter of 2015 versus the year prior. New construction prototype hotels and high-quality conversion projects are planned in markets which include: Salt Lake City, Utah; New York City; Dallas, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; and Columbus, Ohio. These hotels will join recently opened new prototype Comfort brand hotels in Rochester, Minnesota; Woodland, California; Omaha, Nebraska; Youngstown, Ohio; and Kanab, Utah. These new properties, along with dozens of others under construction, are strengthening the Comfort brand portfolio and showcasing its enhanced product offering.\nFRANCHISEE FEEDBACK\n“An abundance of research is conducted before decisions are made to steer the Comfort brand one way or another. This includes, of course, feedback from guests, as well as deep engagement with franchisees,” added Smith. “The success of the Comfort brand is based 100-percent on teamwork, with the franchisees on the frontlines. So their operational expertise and guest insights are invaluable in developing truly impactful yet cost effective brand initiatives.”\nAs a result of this collaboration, overall guest satisfaction scores for the Comfort brand continue to surge to all-time highs. This corresponds with the deliberate steps designed to enhance the on-property experience and to communicate to guests that their care and contentment is always top of mind. The Comfort brand’s recently rolled-out new tagline — Rested. Set. Go. — is an appropriate example. These words were carefully selected to indicate that the brand endeavors to enable travelers to feel rested and ready to take on the day throughout their stay – beginning when they make their reservations, to the moment they enter the hotel, all the way through their departure.\nOther recently announced enhancements to the guest experience include: smoke-free hotels across the entire Comfort portfolio beginning in July 2016, which will make Comfort the largest hotel brand in the industry to eliminate smoking rooms; additional healthy food items offered in the brand’s signature free hot breakfast (such as Greek yogurt with a selection of toppings such as dried fruit, nuts and granola); and welcome stations in the lobby with lemon-infused water. Guests will also soon be able to enjoy the new RAIO™ line of bath and hair products, developed specifically for Comfort hotels and featuring a citrus-mint fragrance to delight the senses. Larger, plusher towels and new shower curtains are also components of the upgraded bath experience to meet the expectations of the upper midscale guest.\nComfort Inn®: Rested. Set.
