US Airways was formed in Pittsburgh as All American Aviation. It later operated as Allegheny Airlines before becoming USAir.\nUS Airways dropped Pittsburgh as a hub in 2004 and American Airlines shut down its nearby flight operations control centre in August, shifting about 650 jobs to Fort Worth, Texas.\n__\nThis story has been corrected to show that the merger was announced in 2013, not 2003.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:18:44.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
