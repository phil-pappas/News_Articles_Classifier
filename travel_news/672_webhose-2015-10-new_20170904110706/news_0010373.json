The Tico superstar has not conceded a single goal during the first five games this season at the club’s home stadium Santiago Bernabéu — more consecutive home shutouts than any Real Madrid goalkeeper in history.\nThe historic fifth shutout took place Saturday against Navas’ former La Liga team, Levante. San Keylor managed a spectacular save in the first half, blocking a fast header aimed straight for the net, giving the offense a chance to sink two goals. Navas finished out the game with two more saves and the offense pulled out one more goal bringing the score to 3-0.\nReal Madrid teammate Cristiano Ronaldo also had a record-breaking moment, scoring his 324th goal, making him Real Madrid’s all-time leading scorer.\nAccounting for this most recent game, Navas averages 0.25 goals per league game, the best average of any goalkeeper in the Spanish league.\nCan’t get enough Keylor Navas news?
