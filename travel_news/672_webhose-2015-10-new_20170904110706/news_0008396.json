But it seems to happen to everyone. I had a really “ish” time in India. For my part, when I went to Cuba I found some things strange (the high cost, once a day bus that was obviously designed to keep tourists where the authorities could keep an eye on them…) but actually found the people incredibly chatty and approachable. There was rather less to do than I had imagined, so I ended up going for long walks or sitting around the casa particular chatting or dancing. (I was forced into both, honest!) Even though my Spanish was bad, it was passable, and it didn’t seem to deter anyone from talking…So I suppose I’m agreeing with Faraz’s comments. Maybe there was some friction because you’re from the US – or maybe it was just one of those things. Anonymous \nThanks for weighing in Abi – the diversity of opinions in the responses have really highlighted how personal each of our travel experiences have been. Not sure when you went, but in some towns I saw the tourism industry picking up, with day trips out of Trinidad to surrounding areas, horse treks, that sort of thing. As for India, you’re not the first to mention that India didn’t quite jive with you, the people you meet, time of year, all of that can have such an incredible effect on the experience! Glad you enjoyed your trip to Cuba though, outside of the costs! :) mackenzie101 \nI am always suprised when I hear someone say that they did not love Cuba. My husband and I were there for 3 weeks over Dec 2009-Jan 2010 and neither of us can wait to go back, even with the epic travel time to get there from Australia. It is one of my two all time favourite countries. Not once did I feel that my experience was “manufactured” from a tourist guide and never did I think I was being watched by the police or the government. In fact without the ability to speak or understand any Spanish at all we still had amazing interactions with the locals, even to the point of being invited into random houses to dance with a family. Every person we met was very open about their thoughts on the government and what they thought about the country, the politics etc. I was carrying around nearly $20,000 worth of camera gear and not once did I fear being robbed or in danger. We even had dinner one night with someone who fought with Che and Fidel in the Sierra Miestro. We managed to travel most of the country with the exception of the Vinniales area. We did a huge amount of research before we went and I wonder if that helped our positve experience. While we were there we met some other travellers also from Australia and they had a totally different experience to us and hated Cuba. I cant wait to go back, hopefully at the end of this year if all goes to plan. And that in itself is unusual because we generally dont go back to the same place as there is so much of the world we still want to see. I am a bit worried that we could have a totally different experience next time and come away not liking Cuba, but I really hope not!! Happy Travels \nSo glad to hear you really enjoyed Cuba, I know the feedback from others was really polarized on that front, and really and truly just could have been a fluke of when we were there (terrible storm for the whole week) and who we happened to encounter. I do actually have some good memories of Cuba, it was an endlessly intriguing country to observe and think about, I just don’t think I was able to get under its skin… \nThat being said, you have me intrigued some more, it’s definitely a place I’ve put on my “to be reconsidered in the future list,” if a friend wanted to go, I would give it a second shot :) Enjoy planning your travels! http://hereishavana.wordpress.com is a great site of a woman living there if you need any tips, she’s in love with the country and people and could surely offer some advice for some more fun things to do, see, and experience! http://www.vagabondquest.com/ Dina VagabondQuest \nI haven’t been there even though keep planning on going there. I want to see what a communist country looks like. It might be selfish for me to want to inspect the living in a communist country (including the government projects and propaganda) while the people is suffering from it, but while I want to visit the country before the change happen, I also wish the change will indeed happen in the near future for the best of the people. Anonymous \nI definitely recommend that you go and visit the country if you’ve always wanted to. That being said, some of the other communist countries feel differently in my opinion. Cuba was unique, perhaps because it is so small and thus easier for high levels of control. :) http://twitter.com/cherrysberries cherrysberries \nSorry that you didn’t have an enjoyable experience. Do you think you’ll return and give it another chance? \nI came back from Cuba with mixed feelings – there were parts that I liked and disliked. While I enjoyed my time there and stayed with locals too (so glad to hear you avoided the resorts) … I came away feeling sad upon seeing the poverty and harsh reality of their every day life. Anonymous \nI do think I will go back someday, particularly if I am with someone else who really wants to visit. I don’t have an overwhelming urge to visit right now, there are so many places I would love to visit for the first time, but I would definitely go back and give it a second chance :) Glad you had elements you loved from your visit as well! http://www.horizonpacificvacations.com/ Horizon Pacific Vacations \nThank you so much for your post. Obviously everyone can walk away from a country with their own opinions on what they experienced. It is nice to hear an honest opinion without simply bashing their experience. I agree though there are so many amazing countries to travel to and to experience. So if its something you didn’t walk away from with a huge smile on your face, is it something you want to spend time and money to do again? Thanks for you honest opinion. Anonymous \nI don’t quite understand the bashing people do either :-/ I realize my experience was so highly personal that all I can do it share what I saw; and for what it’s worth, I would return to Cuba again one day if the opportunity arose! Cheers and thanks for weighing in on this :) http://www.bemytravelmuse.com/ Ava Apollo \nI didn’t think about how much it might matter to use local currency. It was interesting seeing how much your experience changed after you switched! ShannonOD \nIt’s intriguing how different it can be just a block off of the more touristed restaurants in the cities I visited! The more I ponder back on my visit to Cuba, the more I think I’d like to go back and try again! :) Nilda \nI am cuban, fled the country when I was three. I completely agree with your feelings. I hear so many tourists talk about their wonderful experiences in Cuba….but the truth is, they are not experiencing the real Cuba. I haven’t been back there for the same reasons you state….I don’t want to support a communist government that gives nothing back to the people with my money. But I have many Cuban friends that still have to go there to visit their families which are trapped there. The people that live there have nothing to eat, no medicine, nothing. My friends have to take everything…medicine, coffee, soap, clothing, bare necessities and half of it is taken by the police when they arrive. Young girls prostitute themselves for a pair of jeans or a decent meal. I’m glad you wrote this article. Tourists need to know that their money does not make life better for the locals…only the government….and that the Cuba they are seeing is NOT the real Cuba the locals are living. Sad but true. ShannonOD \nHi Nilda, like you, so many of the other travelers have raved about it — and I do know that experiences for travelers can really vary depending on how controlling the government is being that year, but it comes down to a sum total of control and repression spanning decades. It’s hard to overlook that. Thank you for weighing in, one of my Cuban friends shares your sentiments and does not have any desire to return, knowing what his family went through to get out. http://travelworldheritage.com/ Maximuz \nAwesome post. I don’t feel so bad that I can’t go. While you’re right in not wanting to be too negative, there is a lot of realism and true expectations in negative posts. :) I still however hope to go some day. ShannonOD \nMy friends who blog at Neverending Voyage ( http://www.neverendingvoyage.com ) just got back and they generally really enjoyed it, so it’s good to keep your dream — you may go and love it there! :) Amanda Jane Walters \nThis is very interesting as I felt very similarly towards Cuba. We were fortunate to meet some lovely Cuban women who were amazing at salsa dancing. I approached them in the square to see if they could teach my friend and I. They told us that if they are seen speaking to tourists they can get into trouble by the police. Anyway as we had built up a rapport they wanted to teach us. They took us to their very small one room home and we had to walk 10m behind them so it didn’t appear that we were with them. Once inside we had to shut the door even though it was scorchingly hot. Only then did they relax and they gave us the salsa lesson of a lifetime. Such amazing women. The whole family were introduced to us and they were very kind and warm people. But as soon as that door opened at the end … We were sneaked out and had to again follow behind. The people of Cuba when you get under its skin are amazing…but unfortunately it’s not a side that is easy to see. http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nHat similar experiences! And I am sorry that it is that pervasive in the country… After many of the commentors noted that they had more open conversations with many people, I had hoped it was isolated. How fun was the salsa though! It was one of the experiences I was so glad to have to the country. :) Claudia Luxembourg \nYou know, Shannon, I really enjoyed your post. It is perhaps the first time I read someone being so honest about Cuba. I remember before I went there, reading hundreds of blogs and commentaries, all expressing enthusiasm for the country and the people. Don’t get me wrong. I loved it too, and I would love to go back. But I did not find those loving, warm, people that were described. I literally just felt… like a CUC. Do I make sense? There was no way of scraping the surface and finding out what the real Cuba is. There was no way to interact with the locals other than for business transactions. And mind you, I do speak very good Spanish! http://alittleadrift.com/ Shannon O’Donnell \nI know exactly what you mean Claudia, the interactions hinged on being tourists and spending money, from the locals there was also very little push for deeper conversations. It was a tricky place to get under the skin and find people willing to talk about their lives, the issues in their lives, and the deeper nuances of their culture. Claudia Luxembourg \nI would love to share with you a post I wrote for another blog. Nothing massive, but it talks about the love/hate relationship I have with Cuba. Mind you, it took me a lot of effort to be “kind” and keep a balanced perspective and not use bad words! I will send you via email if that is ok :) naamnlqheem \nI’m Cuban. Thanks God I don’t live there anymore. Cubans are too stressed out about survival. Food, destroyed houses, transportation, constant surveillance from the political police. They don’t really care about being warm or friendly anymore. Most of the population wants to leave the country. ← Older Comments → This is the story of a Florida girl (that's me!) who left her home to travel solo around the world.
