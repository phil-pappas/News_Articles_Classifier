French Travel Professionals Pay a Visit  \nEleven (11) French group travel organisers are visiting the island of Ireland this week, as guests of Tourism Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism NI.\n \nThe group – all representatives of tour companies based in Paris and Lyon, responsible for making the travel arrangements for various large French groups – is here to experience at first-hand some of the many things see and do here. Their itinerary includes visits to Christ Church Cathedral and the Book of Kells in Dublin; Trim Castle and Causey Farm in Co Meath; as well as Belfast, the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum and Mount Stewart House and Gardens in Co Down.\n \n \nMonica MacLaverty, Tourism Ireland’s manager Southern Europe, said: “Tourism Ireland was delighted to invite these influential group travel organisers to visit the island of Ireland. We believe it is extremely important for decision-makers such as these to experience for themselves the high standard of our tourism offering and the many things to see and do in Ireland, so they are better equipped to advise their clients on future travel plans. \n \n“France is one of the top four markets for tourism to Ireland and we have seen really good growth in French visitors numbers again this year, with the most recent CSO figures showing an increase of +4% for June to August. We are determined to ensure that tourism growth continues. We have a really extensive autumn campaign in full swing right now – aimed at boosting late-season travel to Ireland from France and elsewhere around the globe.” \n \n \nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:25:09.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
