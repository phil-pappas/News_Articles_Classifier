Chambers said these tools have been designed to “transform” business travel processes, drive efficiency and influence traveller behaviour.\nSmart’s collection of tools includes two applications which are unique to Chambers:\nSmart Forecaster: This helps corporates make their travel budget go further as it enables bookers and travellers to compare available fares and hotel rates for a specified journey prior to making a booking.\nSmart Taxi: This is a customised messaging service developed by CTM that notifies travellers of any colleagues arriving at the same destination within 15 minutes of each other, so they can share taxis.\nThe other applications are: Smart approve; Smart tracker; Smart risk; Smart data; Smart profile; Smart booking and Smart link.\nThe tools can be accessed on a variety of devices including tablet and smartphone.\nLast year, Chambers was acquired by Corporate Travel Management in a deal worth up to £39 million over three years.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:34:50.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
