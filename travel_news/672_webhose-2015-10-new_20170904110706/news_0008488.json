Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bali and Tokyo are the top destinations in Asia for these travellers. \n\n“We have hotels in many of those cities, giving us a competitive advantage to grab the market,” he said. \n\nDorsett is participating at tradeshows such as ITB Asia, World Travel Market and ITB Berlin to meet tour operators handling the market. It is also on the way to becoming a member of the International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association. \n\n“Becoming a member gives us the endorsement that we are LGBT-friendly,” he said. Internally, the hotel group is constantly training its people to host the market. \n\n“We are (a company) which has no fear of communicating with any guest, regardless of their geographical, religious or sexual orientation,” said Schaetz. \n\nHe added: “Fear only exists when you don’t know about it. That is why at Dorsett we have a mission to be loud about LGBT and educate people about what LGBT is all about. \n\n“There is nothing to fear and it is something that you should welcome with open arms. That is again the nature of hospitality.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:48:51.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
