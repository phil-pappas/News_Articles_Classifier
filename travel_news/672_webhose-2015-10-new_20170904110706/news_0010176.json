Natalie Shirinian , founder of NES Creative Services , a communications and branding agency, has been living there since February, and her well-appointed home reflects a cool new age of the storied old neighborhood. She has built an impressive business around promoting designers and artists including Apparatus Studio and Kelly Lamb , and early next year she plans to release her documentary titled Interior Motives , which explores the growing interconnectedness of fashion and interior design through conversations with big names like Maria Cornejo , Ryan Korban , and Rick Owens .\nA native Los Angeleno, Shirinian and her girlfriend only discovered the magic of Laurel Canyon last year after attending a dinner party in the area. “You’re still in L.A., but there’s something about the air,” Shirinian says. “There is a mystical quality about it, and you can only experience it if you live here.” That mysticism might well come from the fact that the small community housed an impressive number of big-name musicians in the 1960s and 1970s, of icons like Joni Mitchell , The Mamas and the Papas, Crosby , Stills & Nash , Jim Morrison, and The Monkees. It was the manager of the latter band who used to occupy what is now Shirinian’s home. The 1920s bungalow-style house, hidden among tree-covered hills and a three-tier garden, features expansive windows and skylights in every room. Inside the space is a mix of sleek furniture and contemporary art, some made by the talented clients on her growing roster. “I wanted to bring in some modern elements with the paint and the lighting fixtures but still remain authentic to the neighborhood and architecture by making sure there was a blend of old and new with the vintage finds and custom pieces,” she says.\nIn the living room is a black leather couch that Shirinian’s client Michael Felix specially made, and just above it, a Merrick surfboard from the shop Channel Islands shop outside of L.A. An original portrait from 1870 that was gifted to her by her best friend and owner of 45 Three also hangs on the same wall. The kitchen is stacked with Heath ceramic bowls and features a photo of Capri from Shirinian’s girlfriend. Enter the sitting room and you will find a vintage chair from Palm Springs; lighting by Apparatus; a Lawson-Fenning rug; and a painting of a mouth from her friend Gloria Noto , makeup artist to the likes of Shailene Woodley and Langley Fox . Each room in the home has unique features, and each room accomplishes what Shirinian set out to do with her interiors: “I wanted guests to feel welcome. I wanted to tell a story. And I wanted people to ask me where I found certain pieces, just like they ask who lived up the street or what the history of the neighborhood is.” Spoken like a true creative.", "external_links": ["http://www.michaelfelix.com/", "http://www.lawsonfenning.com/#1", "http://www.45threehome.com/", "http://kellylamb.net/", "http://entrypictures.com/films", "http://nescreativeservices.com/", "http://apparatusstudio.com/"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:34:49.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
