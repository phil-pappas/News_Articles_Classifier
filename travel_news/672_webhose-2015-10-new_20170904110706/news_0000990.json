At 13.20 UTC, a 9N314M warhead, launched by a Buk surface-to-air missile system from a 320km2 area in the eastern part of Ukraine, detonated on the left side of the cockpit. \n\nThe forward section of the aircraft was penetrated by hundreds of high-energy objects coming from the warhead. As a result of the impact and the subsequent blast, the three crew members in the cockpit were killed immediately and the plane broke up in the air. Wreckage was distributed over various sites within an area of 50km 2 . \n\nTjibbe Joustra, chairman of the Dutch Safety Board unveiled the final report yesterday but did not say who fired the missile. \n\nAccording to a report in The Star today, Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said criminal investigation led by the Dutch with Malaysia’s full support, must give definitive answers and allow for the “strongest action” against those responsible. \n\nMalaysia Airlines said in a media statement yesterday that it will continue to support families until all issues are resolved.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:23:02.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
