The newly - added flights will serve Newark Liberty International Airport, offering an additional easy travel option for travelers between the two regions.\nNewark Liberty International Airport is one of the five biggest international airports in the United States and ranks among the three main airports of New York alongside JFK Airport and La Guardia Airport. The flights to be added will make Air China the only Chinese carrier serving Newark Airport. Up to now, Air China has been operating two daily flights from Beijing Capital International Airport to JFK Airport.\nAccording to Air China, the carrier has made the decision to serve Newark because of the airport's well - developed transportation network and ideal geographical location. The flights to be added will not only offer an additional travel option for passengers destined for New York , but also make it much easier for passengers to fly from Beijing to Newark and then make flight connections to other US cities. What's more, AirTrain Newark, a monorail people mover system, can get passengers from any of Newark Airport's terminals to the train station within just minutes, where passengers can hop onto the train to Manhattan 16 miles away. It's just a 30-minute drive from the airport to the Pennsylvania Station in downtown Manhattan .

Air China put Boeing 747-8, a new member of the Boeing 747 family, into service on its Beijing - New York route at the beginning of the year, increased its Beijing - Los Angeles service to three daily flights in May and will start the Beijing - Montreal service in September. The forthcoming additional flights to New York will further enhance Air China's presence in the Americas.
