The tiny town boasts seven restaurants on The Chronicle’s Top 100 list, including the Michelin three-star French Laundry (home of the $295 lunch). Tucked between are luxury hotels, boutiques, tasting rooms and fancy shops inside those tasting rooms where visitors can sip Syrah while coveting thousand-dollar hammered copperware pots. \nYet the headquarters of Thomas Keller ’s empire is hardly a tourist trap. There are plenty of good values — in fact, it’s possible to spend a lovely day on the town for just under $40. Skeptical? Read on: More Napa Valley Venture beyond the valley floor in Napa \nFirst stop: The Visitor Information Center , where you’ll pick up complimentary maps of the town’s Art Walk (more on this below) and, best of all, coupons for two-for-one wine tastings in town (on a recent visit: Hill Family Estates and Hope and Grace Wines). 6484-F Washington St. (707) 944-0904. \nFuel up: From the visitor center, you’ll spot tourists toting distinctive green-bottomed bags. Follow them upstream to Bouchon Bakery. Thomas Keller’s take on a classic French patisserie is a stop on nearly every visitor’s list. Don’t let the line discourage you; it moves quickly, which means you’ll still have trouble deciding which of chef Janine Weismann ’s pastries to pick. The almond croissant ($3.75) is an excellent choice; add a cup of Equator coffee ($2.25). Curbside seating is plentiful, but carry your pastry to the next stop, another of the French Laundry-associated sites. Bouchon Bakery, 6528 Washington St., (707) 944-2253. \nThe French Laundry Garden: This gorgeous 3-acre garden supplies vegetables, flowers and herbs to Keller’s Yountville restaurants. It’s open to the public, and chairs and tables tucked around the edges invite visitors to linger between plots of specialty ‘Espellette’ peppers and celery root. Take time to wander the grass pathways (not drought-tolerant but pretty) and check out plots of ‘Musque de Provence’ squash, ‘Nero Tondo’ radishes and plush carpets of microgreens sprouting in the greenhouse. Other highlights: beehives and a flock of fluffy (and well-fed) bantam hens. Washington Street and Webber Avenue. \nArt walk: The Yountville Art Commission has turned downtown into an open-air gallery, with 40 sculptures placed throughout town, many in unexpected places: Rich Botto’s whimsical collection of rock mushrooms, for example, sprouts in front of the sheriff’s office. Many of the works are for sale (including Botto’s for $35,000), with a percentage going to the Yountville Arts fund. Download a map and get more information at www.townofyountville.com. \nLunch: Options are plentiful. If you’re in the mood for a picnic, pick up provisions at Ranch Market (6498 Washington St.) and head to one of the town’s parks. Or order a salad or panini from the Paninoteca at Michael Chiarello ’s flagship NapaStyle store and dine on the veranda (6525 Washington St.). At Addendum, Keller’s lunch shack behind Ad Hoc, you can order a pulled pork sandwich, barbecue pork ribs or the famous fried chicken (plus biscuit, coleslaw and macaroni salad) for $16.50. 6476 Washington St, Yountville, (707) 944-1565. 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Thursday-Saturday. www.thomaskeller.com. \nBrowse shops: Yountville is prime shopping territory. Ground zero is V Marketplace, a collection of specialty shops, galleries and restaurants inside the former brick winery owned by the Groezinger family. Watch artisan chocolatiers turn out confections in the glass-enclosed kitchen at Koller Chocolates, or pinch samples of olive oils, dips and spreads at NapaStyle. Upstairs, browse galleries and clothing boutiques, including Tay and Grace, which specializes in “playclothes for women.” 6525 Washington St., (707) 944-2451. www.vmarketplace.com. \nMuseum: Napa Museum ’s exhibition “Nourish” is guaranteed to feed your inner epicure. Works by artists and chefs, including Wayne Thiebaud , Richard Diebenkorn, Caitlin Williams Freeman , Alinea chef Grant Achatz and many others, explore the intersection of food and dining, history and art. Be sure to check out the live stream from the kitchen of La Maison Pic in Valence, France. $7 admission. 11 a.m.-4 p.m. Wednesday-Sunday (live stream 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday). Through Nov. 29. 55 Presidents Circle, Yountville, (707) 944-0500. \nDomaine Chandon: As you leave the museum, take a short detour to Domaine Chandon, the sparkling wine producer founded by French Champagne house Moet and Chandon in 1973. Skip the crowded (and noisy) tasting room and order a glass of the brut classic ($9) or sparkling rosé ($10) and wander under the oaks, raising a toast to your day on the town. 1 California Drive, Yountville, (707) 944-8844. \nDeb Wandell is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
