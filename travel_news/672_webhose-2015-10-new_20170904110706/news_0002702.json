They epitomise modern Australia and really embody the new look and feel of P&O Cruises so we are delighted they will be naming these very special ships – and in such a modern way,” Ms Sherry said.\n“It will be a history-making day – we will have five ships on Sydney Harbour, a dual christening and we’ll be officially naming the ships via Twitter, which we believe is a world first.”\nThe ships’ naming ceremony – which will see Jessica Mauboy name Pacific Aria and Kate Ritchie name Pacific Eden – will be a highlight of P&O’s history-making Five Ship Spectacular on Sydney Harbour on November 25.\nThe day will begin with the cruise line’s five-ship fleet creating a V formation off the Heads of Sydney Harbour early in the morning, as they meet for the first time.\nThe ships will then enter the Harbour single file, with Pacific Aria and Pacific Eden following their three big sisters. As they reach the centre of the Harbour around 8.30am, Pacific Aria and Pacific Eden will sail either side of Fort Denison, where their godmothers will name them and Champagne bottles will be smashed on their bows.\nThe five ships will then berth in the Harbour, with 25 artists performing live concerts onboard for guests in the afternoon – including Jessica Mauboy on Pacific Aria. The ships will sail from Sydney in the evening following a spectacular fireworks display for Sydneysiders at 8.45pm.\nJessica Mauboy is an award-winning singer who grew up in Darwin in Australia’s north and shot to stardom in 2006 after appearing on the television show Australian Idol. Her debut 2008 album “Been Waiting” scored double platinum sales and yielded seven ARIA Award nominations. She has since won two ARIAs and has been nominated again for this year’s ARIA awards.\nKate Ritchie is one of Australia’s best loved actresses, having spent 20 years as a lead on Home and Away, a role which earned her two Gold and three Silver Logies. Kate currently co-hosts the ACRA winning Nova’s Kate, Tim & Marty national drive show alongside Tim Blackwell and Marty Sheargold. Previously she co-hosted the extremely popular breakfast radio show on Nova 969 with Merrick and Rosso throughout 2008 and 2009 and appeared on Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities. Kate has been the host and narrator of Don’t Tell the Bride, she has starred alongside Shaun Micallef and Kat Stewart in the drama Mr & Mrs Murder and in Peter Helliar’s project, It’s A Date.\nTwo Australian charities will also be the beneficiaries of the event with P&O Cruises making a financial contribution to charities nominated by the Godmothers.\nJessica Mauboy has chosen the Indigenous Literacy Foundation as her charity for the event while Kate Ritchie is yet to announce her charity.\nRegarded as game changers for the Australian cruise industry, Pacific Aria and Pacific Eden will feature a fresh, contemporary design and a host of special features from multiple restaurants and a lush private dining room to a resort-style swimming pool deck, with sheer curtains and private cabanas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:57:08.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
