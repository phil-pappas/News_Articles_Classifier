But the travelers know the itinerary will not be as stated in the contract. \nConcerns over excessively cheap tours to Hong Kong were raised again last week when Miao Chunqi, a 54-year-old man from Heilongjiang province, died after he was allegedly beaten while trying to mediate a dispute between another tourist and their tour leader. \nHong Kong's tourism watchdog is investigating whether the travel agency charged excessively low fees. \nTravel industry representatives said some travel agents were known to offer very cheap packages to attract customers, relying on commissions from sales during shopping stops to make money. \nSome cheap tours organised by mainland agencies also hired \"shadow tour members\" to persuade other visitors to spend more on the shopping trips. \nHong Kong Travel Industry Council chairman Michael Wu Siu-ieng said he welcomed the administration's announcement. He also said the council planned to release a guide on appropriate price ranges for tours to Hong Kong. \nThe council would also discuss how the guidelines would fit in with competition laws to avoid price fixing. \nA legal adviser for a mainland travel company said the government should impose tougher punishments to eradicate these kinds of tours. \nMainland tourism authorities banned \"free\" tours in 2013, and prohibited agencies from luring customers through low-cost trips on which people are later forced to shop. \nHong Kong Inbound Tour Operators Association chairman Ricky Tse Kam-ting welcomed the administration's move, saying consumers and vendors had to take some responsibility. \nBut lawmaker James Tien Pei-chun, who chairs the Legislative Council's economic development panel, said the only way to curb the practice was to introduce some form of legislation. \n\"If Hong Kong had a law and the mainland had a law â€¦ making [forced shopping] a crime... tour agencies wouldn't do it, tour operators wouldn't do it and tour leaders wouldn't do it,\" Tien said.
