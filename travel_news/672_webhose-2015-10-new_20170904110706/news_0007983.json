Extraordinary light filtering down from an immense and unmarked sky bathes the entire otherworldly landscape during the day; at night, the heavenly canopy flickers with the burning bright spots of countless stars. For fans of our planet’s greatest natural wonders, the 278sq m Wadi Rum, one of Jordan’s treasured Unesco World Heritage Sites, is simply not to be missed. “Vast, echoing and godlike” was how TE Lawrence, aka Lawrence of Arabia, described it in his book Seven Pillars of Wisdom . One group of giant rocks, some of which rise up from the desert floor to heights of 5,740ft, was named after the book in the Eighties. You could clamber into a peaceful, private spot up among the rocks to simply stop and soak in the magnificence around you It was here that Lawrence and Prince Faisal Bin Hussein established their headquarters during the Arab Revolt almost 100 years ago. It was also where acclaimed director David Lean’s filmed his famous 1962 cinematic account of their exploits, with Peter O’Toole and Alec Guinness playing the aforementioned allies. More recently, Theeb , an independent film featuring Wadi Rum, has been released in the UK. Director Naji Abu Nowar, who is British/Jordanian, spent a year living with the Bedouin there. And Wadi Rum doubled for Mars in Ridley Scott’s new blockbuster film, The Martian , starring Matt Damon that hit screens at the end of September 2015. Every year, there are more options for experiencing and exploring this unique habitat. Imagine flying high above the desert on a microlight or light aircraft, or floating silently in a hot-air balloon. You can even go skydiving. Hidden canyons: discover the rock carvings of people and animals, and cryptic hieroglyphs carved into the stone On the ground, take a thrilling safari in a 4x4 vehicle or all-terrain vehicle (ATV), enjoy the views from horseback or, for something completely different, astride a grumpy-faced camel, all led by proud Bedouin guides. On foot, you could hike up to the famous Burdah Rock Bridge perhaps, to Lawrence’s Spring and into hidden canyons to discover the rock carvings of people and animals, and cryptic hieroglyphs carved into the stone by nomadic Nabateans more than 4,000 years ago. Walks can be short, sweet leisurely strolls, more strenuous river and canyon negotiations, or even mountaineering, depending on how hardcore an adventurer you are. Gentler souls may relish sunrise and sunset yoga classes in Wadi Rum. Alternatively, you could clamber into a peaceful, private spot up among the rocks to simply stop and soak in the magnificence around you. Look out for flora and fauna: this is not barren desert. In springtime, around 2,000 types of wild flowers – including red anemones, poppies and striking black irises ­– sprinkle the sands. For bird watchers, it’s paradise with more than 110 species registered, including majestic eagles, vultures and buzzards. There are some amazing animals, too, ranging from wolves and desert foxes to sand cats and mountain goats – you may not see them, but just maybe they’ve seen you. Wadi Rum is not a place to just come to and pass though, as marvellous as that might be; do stay a while, ideally in one of the Bedouin camps for an authentic look at the desert dwellers’ traditional way of life. You can overnight in a goat-hair tent, where you might feast on hummus and warm flatbreads, juicy chicken and fresh salads, seated on cushions. Later, drag a mattress outside to the nearest dune, snuggle under a blanket and sip rich cardamom-flavoured coffee as you count the stars. Whichever way you look at it, Wadi Rum is truly exceptional.
