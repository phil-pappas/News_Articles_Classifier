The Amazon Discovery is arguably the most luxurious Amazon river cruise vessel, with all the state-of-the-art modern amenities expected of a luxury hotel and decor inspired by the rainforest itself, with local sustainably harvested hardwood furnishings and colorful artwork and handmade Peruvian textiles from Amazonian villages.\nWith capacity for 43 passengers, her 22 spacious suites range from the specially-designed single occupancy Fauna Stateroom at 121 square feet, to the immense Amazonia Suite at 597 square feet in size. All have 5-star features including individual climate control, luxuriously soft robes and slippers, all natural therapeutic bath amenities, copious amounts of storage space, telescopes for star-gazing, daily housekeeping with turndown service, the finest bed linens and duvets, and you can even choose your pillow each night with their unique pillow menu.\nThe high comfort levels aren’t limited to the suites. Passengers can expect well-appointed social areas such as the Open-Air Deck with cushioned chaise lounge and shaded bar, an air-conditioned Canopy Lounge with floor-to-ceiling windows for breathtaking jungle views, and can indulge themselves with gourmet cuisine in the Andes Dining Room and the relaxing delights of the on-board Rainforest Spa, including stone massages, soothing wraps and coffee-cacao scrubs.\nTom Markwell, the vessel’s proud representative says:\n“The new all-suite Amazon Discovery will set a new standard of cruising the Peruvian Amazon, delivering pure luxury and comfort in a destination that is the very definition of wild. Offering just 22 suites, the Amazon Discovery will provide a luxurious and intimate venue from which to learn about one of the world’s most important waterways.”\nJungle excursions include skiff expeditions into the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve for wildlife observation and piranha fishing, trips along the black-waters of the Tahuayo River and a visit to the headwaters of the Amazon River, while jungle treks include wildlife walks, traditional village visits and the chance to learn about medicinal plants, all whilst being escorted by highly-trained expert guides.\nRainforest Cruises is offering four and seven-day cruises aboard the Amazon Discovery, and their Early Bird Offer includes Free Domestic Flights (Lima-Iquitos-Lima) with LAN airlines for any 2016 7-Day Amazon Discovery cruise booked before December 31, 2015.\nAmazon Discovery Details:\n~ Expedition cruises: 4-Day and 7-Day\n~ Included: full board, transfers and jungle excursions\n~ Departures: Weekly from November 2015\n~ Available: All year round\n~ Maximum: 43 passengers\n~ Prices: starting from $1,989 per person/ double occupancy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:41:20.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
