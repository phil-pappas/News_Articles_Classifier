The government will also extend its network of Visa Application Centers across China. \nDavid Scowsill, President and CEO, WTTC, said: “I would like to commend the UK government on this great effort. Extending the period of validity of the visas and expanding the UK mobile fingerprinting service from 9 Chinese cities to 50 is an important step by the government to welcome more Chinese travelers to the country. \n“Travel and tourism brings countries economic growth, job creation and social benefit. In 2014, Travel & Tourism generated 10.5% of the UK GDP, or £187.7 billion, and supported 4.2 million jobs, 12.7% of total employment. The announced changes will help the UK to benefit from increased travel from one of the world’s fastest growing tourism markets, and thus boost its economy - specifically the retail and hospitality sectors.” \nScowsill added: “The recently announced changes are a great step in the right direction, however there are still many challenges to overcome to make the visa process even easier. WTTC analysis has shown that extending the length of stay does make a difference but does not have as impactful as a visa waiver program. The USA has a visa waiver program with 38 countries. This type of program is what WTTC ultimately would like to see between the UK and China. \nA visa waiver program between the two countries would allow Chinese and British travelers to complete visa application processes online in the comfort of their home or office, with all fingerprint and biometric controls carried out on arrival in the destination country.” \nETN is a media partner for WTTC.
