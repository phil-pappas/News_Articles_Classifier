The announcement took place on September 23, 2015, in Mexico City at an awards ceremony that celebrated premier Latin American restaurants. The ceremony showcased its top chefs in the region, as well as key figures in the restaurant industry.\nHow are Latin America’s Top 50 Restaurants selected? The list is created by the votes of the 252 members of San Pellegrino’s Latin America’s 50 Best Restaurants Academy. The event is organised by William Reed Media Group, and neither the organiser, nor any of the sponsors have any influence on the decisions made by the members.\nLatin America’s 50 Best Restaurants is a snapshot of the opinions and experiences of 252 Latin American restaurant industry experts, and is in it’s third edition. It is an honour for Elena to be recognised by these experts during its first three years since opening in 2013.\nThe food and beverage phenomenon at Four Seasons Hotel Buenos Aires started almost four years ago and revolutionised the restaurant and bar concept for hotels in the city. This revolution has been led by Executive Chef Juan Gaffuri, who oversees Elena, as well as Nuestro Secreto, Pony Line Bar and the private events at Four Seasons Hotel Buenos Aires.\nJuan Gaffuri said during the award ceremony, “I’m so happy that for a third year in a row, Elena Restaurant has been included in this prestigious list, not just because of our wonderful team but also because what it means for Argentine gastronomy to be recognised in this manner. We will continue to work in offering our guests the best experience in town!”\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:10:17.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
