The new fam rate is available exclusively to U.S. travel agents for resort stays enjoyed by December 22, 2015.\n“The changes we’ve made go well beyond dropping ‘SunSpree’ from our name and adopting a new logo,” said Nicola Madden-Greig, Group Director of Marketing & Sales. “We look forward to showing off our revamped product to our travel agent partners to help them better sell the property moving forward.”\nIn April 2015, the Holiday Inn Resort® Montego Bay unveiled its new brand identity and logo following a US$15 million renovation. Upgrades and improvements extend throughout the resort, including guestrooms, the expansive ocean-view lobby, the on-site Sol-Mer Spa & Beauty Salon, and each of the property’s four restaurants.\nNotably, an all-new adults-only section of the property was also inaugurated with the renovation. Dubbed the RoseHall Club, the new 52-room “resort within a resort” concept features an adults-only pool with swim-up bar, an elegant and exclusive adults-only lounge, and premium amenities and services designed with adults in mind.\nThe $124 per-night fam rate at the Holiday Inn Resort® Montego Bay is inclusive of taxes and applies to single and double occupancy accommodations.\nSource:- Holiday Inn Resort Montego Bay", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:48:15.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
