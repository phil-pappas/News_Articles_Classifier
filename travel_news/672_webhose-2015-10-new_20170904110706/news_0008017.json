I live a short distance from the castle. His letter reminded me of a time when my husband and I took our young niece inside the castle to explore the medieval rooms. While there we experienced a horrific thunderstorm. We were rooted to the spot as lightning illuminated the gloomy interior and thunder, worthy of sound effects for the film Macbeth deafened us. On a brighter note, the beach below the castle is also memorable and has featured in a number of historic films. Three miles of glorious golden sands backed by dramatic sand dunes. Please do visit, but remember to keep an eye on the weather forecast.

Here’s a selection of those posted online: I love Classical sites, so am rather ashamed to see I’ve been to only three of those recommended. I hope to see them all at some point. Others not to miss are Olympia and Baalbek. Mycenae is also rather special, if only because it provides a glimpse even deeper into the past … I agree wholeheartedly about Olympia: another site that springs to mind is Dion at the foot of Mount Olympus, which is still being investigated. • Mary Beard's Pompeii I have been fortunate to visit most of these and I would rate Ostia, Paestum and Delphi as ''must sees’’; regrettably, the Acropolis is much overrated, although the new museum nearby isn’t too bad. I was glad to see Timgad included in the selection. Even the generally risk-averse Foreign Office is OK with visiting that part of Algeria. I would recommend going with a group, though. Algeria is not Syria. Anybody interested in sites of antiquity should make time to visit the Pont du Gard aqueduct in France: a stunning piece of 2,000-year-old Roman architecture. (Mary Beard replies: “It sure is ... sadly it didn’t quite make the cut ... hurt not to.”) Old Red Fort, St Croix Photo: Fotolia/AP Quirkiness in St Croix St Croix was barely mentioned in the article about the US Virgin Islands , perhaps because it is still more Caribbean than American, but it has some wonderful quirky places to stay and eat. We stayed in the old slave quarters of a plantation house, where breakfast was served on our balcony at whatever time we emerged in the morning and rum cocktails were bought over as we watched the bats emerge at dusk. We hired a Mini Moke and drove around the island discovering great places to eat, swim and snorkel. Barbecue lunch on a beach, where a steel band had set up and local families ate, laughed and danced, was a highlight. Finding sea horses under the pier at Frederiksted was tempered by discovering the small amount of cash we carried had been removed while we snorkelled, but the shop was happy to provide drinks to be paid for another day. It is a different experience to the other two US Virgin Islands, but one that has its roots in its Dutch past. Carol Hopperton Coral bleaching Your news item highlighting the damage being caused to the world’s greatest reefs by coral bleaching was timely. Many marine biologists and climate scientists say what is happening is a consequence of global warming and there have been plenty of reports about this issue over the past 25 years in science journals, and even in a television programme featuring Martin Clunes diving in the Maldives . Tourism has to become more responsible about encouraging people to swarm over natural wonders. They’re not just selling bed-nights – they’re killing the goose and there will be no more golden egg for them or anyone else… Comment posted online Coral reef Photo: Fotolia/AP In addition to Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef, what about reefs closer to home? The Red Sea has some great corals – try Aqaba in Jordan. Oman has good diving and snorkelling, too, as do many locations in the Arabian Gulf. Even Norway has some great coldwater corals.
