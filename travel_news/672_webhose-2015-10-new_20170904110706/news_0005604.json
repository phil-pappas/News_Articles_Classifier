Ms Rudd used her speech to the Conservative Party conference to announce a crackdown on misbehaving firms and industry-wide customer service problems. She said the ombudsman, which investigates complaints, would be given \"real teeth\" so he could look at systemic issues in the industry, not just individual cases. \"Where companies have developed a pattern of bad behaviour, they will have no hiding place,\" she said. . @AmberRudd_MP : I am a proud green Conservative on the side of the consumer. #CPC15 — CCHQ Press Office (@CCHQPress) October 5, 2015 The Department of Energy and Climate Change said the most common widespread issues were companies \"failing to respond to customer complaints\", and delays in repaying overestimated bills. In a statement, Ms Rudd said that families and businesses \"should not have to tolerate\" poor service from energy companies. \"We will work with @ofgem and @CitizensAdvice to strengthen the Energy Ombudsman’s role\" @AmberRudd_MP #CPC15 pic.twitter.com/jCzh7u1iKp — Dods Monitoring (@dodsmonitoring) October 5, 2015 “We want to see the Ombudsman’s role going beyond simply resolving individual complaints so that it has real teeth and can work with Ofgem to address industry-wide problems that are making life miserable for consumers , as well as deal with repeated failings of poorly-performing firms,\" she said. Lewis Shand Smith, the chief ombudsman, welcomed the announcement which it said represented \"an excellent opportunity to adopt a new, collaborative approach with industry to improving standards and performance across the retail market\". Problems with estimated bills are a common complaint Photo: PA Ms Rudd also used her conference speech to declare there was no \"magic money tree\" for low carbon energy projects, hailing the Government's cut to onshore wind farm subsidies as a \"promise made, promise delivered\". She denied claims that cuts to renewable electricity subsidies were \"motivated by ideological opposition to anything green\", insisting: \"Nothing could be further from the truth.\" Energy secretary Amber Rudd didn't mention Paris climate talks in her speech, Labour source notes. — George Eaton (@georgeeaton) October 5, 2015 telepolitics Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:37:33.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
