Dozens of grown men and women, walking around in matching white dressing gowns as if it were the most normal thing in the world. \nIt is normal here. This is Champneys Health Spa – a place famed for bringing health, vitality and relaxation to the masses. \nAnd that’s exactly what the wife and I needed, some much needed R&R. \nIt was our second visit to Champneys – the last was 10 years ago and we filled the intervening decade with three children who have brought joy to our world and a serious hindrance to the concept of rest and relaxation. \nSo here we are again, a little more tired and defeated, a few more wrinkles, and fully expecting Champneys to iron all those little peccadilloes out. \nChampneys in Tring is an odd sight when you arrive. I am hard-wired to expect an imposing classic country pile facing me so felt a little downbeat to the see the odd collection of red brick buildings which had merged together to form the mansion house. \nBut it is in a beautiful rural location, set in impressive grounds. \nLet it be said I find it quite hard to switch off, and as my wife settled into a lounger in the sun I wandered off to see what I could do. Promoted stories \nThere is an incredible array of activities including the expected yoga and meditation to more intense cardio workouts and gym workouts. \nI returned, having signed up for two spinning classes which promised a tough time on an exercise bike. \nMy wife, far better at relaxing than me, had found the “relaxation room” while I was booking my sessions. I use inverted commas because it really should be named the sleeping room with its ski-lodge vibe and dimmed lighting. \nWe were only there for a little over 24 hours but in that time fitted in guilt-free naps, healthy meals eaten at stress-free tables and, in my case, some exercise so ferocious it made my eyeballs stand out on stalks. \nThe food at Champneys is excellent, although, as you might expect at a health spa, the portions are somewhat minimal. \nI had a mild panic attack when I made the huge mistake of turning down extra vegetables before seeing how little there was on my plate. \nEither way it’s hard not to come away from Champneys with a healthy glow about you. But bear in mind, at a cost of about £300 for a couple, and that’s before you book any treatments like a massage, it’s not cheap. In fact I almost re-stressed while paying the bill. \nChampneys Tring is at Chesham Road Wigginton Hertfordshire. HP23 6HX.
