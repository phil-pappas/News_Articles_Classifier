The hotel, managed by Aimbridge Hospitality, marks the ninth Hyatt-branded hotel to open in the Houston area. Its convenient location next to Texas’ largest shopping center, The Galleria ® , and choice of in-hotel amenities that put guests in the driver seat – from grab-and-go or sit-down dining options to meeting spaces for groups of all sizes – make Hyatt Regency Houston Galleria a one-stop experience.\nThe hotel is part of the 7.6-acre, mixed-use Galleria Plaza development, which includes high-end retail and specialty stores, luxury apartments and several recently completed office towers. The development will also include Hyatt Place Houston Galleria, adjacent to Hyatt Regency Houston Galleria. The Hyatt Place hotel is currently under construction and is expected to open in early 2016.\n“We are delighted to welcome guests and the local community to our new hotel, located in the heart of one of Houston’s fastest growing neighborhoods and premiere shopping destinations,” said Area Manager Adam Patenaude. “Here, travelers can leave every detail to our dedicated hotel team, so they are free to break from routine if they choose or simply do things they way they want to do them.”\nLocally Inspired Arrival and Interiors\nUpon entering the hotel driveway, a commissioned, three-dimensional metal sculpture depicts a bird’s eye view of the Houston bayou and welcomes guests to Hyatt Regency Houston Galleria. Original artwork throughout the hotel follows a geological theme while paying tribute to the oil industry and its workers; additionally, local Houston artists created several one-of-a-kind pieces throughout the hotel. The front desk is a focal point, displaying another three-dimensional metal sculpture inspired by the shape of geodes. To connect the first and second floors, a grand staircase of exposed steel with walnut stair threads and soaring diagonal wood posts pierces through the second floor.\nFunctional Guestrooms\nHyatt Regency Houston Galleria features 325 rooms, including 20 suites and eight accessible rooms, designed to meet the needs of both business and leisure travelers. Guestroom design and concepts are inspired by elements of the oil and gas industry with built-in furnishings that offer a more spacious and modern aesthetic. Each room comes standard with a 55” flat-screen television with plug-and-play capabilities from personal devices, free high-speed Internet access, mini-fridge, coffeemaker and a signature Hyatt Grand Bed ® .\nAll-Day Dining Options\nHyatt Regency Houston Galleria offers high-quality, locally sourced food and beverages available all day. The Urban Star restaurant, bar and market features seasonal menus using local ingredients to create dishes that embody the flavors of Texas and the rich tradition of southern hospitality. The first-floor restaurant features seasonally changing menus showcasing foods from Texas.
