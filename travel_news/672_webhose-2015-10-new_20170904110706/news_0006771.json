This unique collaboration between the European Union and the United States transforms the capital region into an action-packed cultural adventure for young people, their families, and their teachers. \n\"Kids Euro Festival continues to offer children and their families a unique opportunity to experience some of Europe's best performers right here in Washington, D.C.,\" said David O'Sullivan, Ambassador of the European Union to the United States. \"As a joint cultural diplomacy initiative of the European Union embassies in the nation's capital, it is also a wonderful celebration of European cultural diversity. It is my hope that every child and parent that participates in this Festival will have a lasting fond memory of their European cultural experience.\" \nSusan Carmel Lehrman, the Vice-President of the European-American Cultural Foundation (E-ACF), said, \"Culture is a powerful force for bringing together people, families, and nations. As the organizer of Kids Euro Festival, the E-ACF knows that the arts are more than just entertainment — they are a way to share cultures, create understanding, and unite people from around the world.\" \nTheater, puppets, music, magic, dance, films, stories, and more stimulate creative imaginations and invite artistic exploration. Since it began in 2008, Kids Euro Festival has reached almost 150,000 culturally curious children and their parents, delivering a memorable \"trip to Europe without a passport.\" \nParticipating in Kids Euro Festival are all the 28 E.U.
