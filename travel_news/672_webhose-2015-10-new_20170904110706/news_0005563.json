Embark on a Great British Drive » It’s that time of year when the nights start to draw in and, at least for some motorists, tyre anxiety begins to creep in again. Some drivers will be quietly relieved because – recalling that they didn’t make the recommended switch back from winter tyres in spring – they are already set for the freezing conditions ahead. A greater number of motorists, however, will be worrying because even though they have heard all about the safety benefits of winter tyres that offer greater grip in cold, slippery conditions – they know they probably won’t get around to fitting them at all. British Gas, is fitting Michelin CrossClimate tyres to its fleet of 13,000 commercial vehicles They will be pleased to hear that there’s now a solution for all motorists: Michelin’s revolutionary new CrossClimate, the first ever summer tyre also certified for use in winter (having met all the criteria for “Three Peak Mountain Snowflake” accreditation, the standard demanded in countries where winter tyres are a legal requirement). Unless you frequently drive in extremely severe winter conditions, Michelin CrossClimate’s combination of summer and winter tyre technology means an end to the need to switch tyres at all, as seasons come and go. And an end to those feelings of tyre anxiety. It’s reassuring to know that Britain’s largest energy provider, British Gas, is fitting Michelin CrossClimate tyres to its fleet of 13,000 commercial vehicles. And to know that, whatever the weather, their customers will continue to have functioning heating when the weather closes in.
