The challenges come in many forms – and sometimes all at once – ensuring that dealing with them can be as much a psychological task as a practical one. Serial entrepreneur and angel investor Brett Akker knows how important it is for entrepreneurs to stay strong in the face of adversity. Mr Akker co-founded pay-as-you-go car club Streetcar in 2004, selling it for £30m six years later. Now he's the chairman and founder of pay-by-the-box storage company Lovespace, which is aiming to shake up the depot sector like Streetcar did the car rental market. Here he describes his biggest business obstacles and how he overcame them. Get known Having a great idea is all well and good, but it’s worthless unless people know about it. Entrepreneurs need to think hard about who their customers are and where they can find them, and it’s often the case that early research throws up unexpected data that allows a strategic rethink. “You need to be really targeted from a marketing perspective,” says Mr Akker. “When we launched Streetcar, we were really low tech and stood outside tube stations handing out flyers to commuters. We soon realised these people were our ideal customers as either they didn't own cars or they tended to leave them at home a lot.” Finding the right people As the saying goes, without followers, a leader is just someone taking a walk. But finding the right staff to join you on your entrepreneurial journey is often hard for small business owners. Mr Akker says that without the budget to hire at full market rates, young businesses need to find other, more innovative ways to attract staff. Looking outside the expected areas can also help bring in talent you may never have considered – and at a fraction of the price. The pair tried to bring in people that fit the existing team dynamic, says Mr Akker. “We tried using experienced staff, but found that it was better to hire young graduates and train them. It took a month or so before they were really effective, but it was better in the long run.” A good company culture and benefits, such as free drinks and a comfortable working environment, go a long way to boosting morale. Even when the company neared 250 staff, Mr Akker and his business partner Andrew Valentine interviewed every new recruit. This is where the maxim of “hiring for attitude, but training for skill” came in, he says. Creating economies of scale Typically, the more you produce, the more the cost per unit falls. However, generating economies of scale can be a challenge for small businesses. “Something we've used to great effect is working with third parties,” says Mr Akker. “With Lovespace, we started working with a third-party courier service to enable us to do many of the big things we wanted to offer customers.” By being open to working with third parties, through outsourcing or creating partnerships, entrepreneurs can access the resources and personnel of others – and offset some of the costs that might inhibit new approaches and expansions should you try and keep everything in-house. Access to finance Of course, the biggest partner to most small businesses is still their financier. When Mr Akker and Mr Valentine set up Streetcar, access to finance was very much an issue, and their unusual product meant that they had more challenges than most when proposing their idea. Unlike other car rentals, Streetcar's pay-as-you-go vehicles would be left on the street and accessed via swipe cards. This completely new concept was seen by their early financiers as risky, and the entrepreneurs’ perseverance was seriously tested, along with their ability to carefully explain the business plan – often repetitively. “We didn't need much money as we had launched with our savings,” says Mr Akker. “But in the end we had to go to over 70 finance providers before someone would finance our first fleet of vehicles.” If you have a new idea for your business but need the funding to make it a reality, take a look at The Elevator Competition, in which HSBC is offering businesses the chance to win £150,000 in investment » • For more information, visit knowledge.hsbc.co.uk » You may also be interested in: • Business success stories reveal moment of truth » • How to make a good first impression during a pitch » • Five ways to unlock innovation in your business »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:05:38.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
