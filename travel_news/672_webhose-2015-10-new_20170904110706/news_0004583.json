That’s what Nick Hewer, former adviser to Lord Sugar, Apprentice star, and small business consultant told me recently. What will happen to small firms once they rise? Nick warned that many people would be burnt out, having taken on too much cheap debt over the past few years. “It can’t go on indefinitely,” he says. The Bank of England this month decided once again to keep rates at the low of 0.5pc – it’s been six and a half years now. Economists seem to think that a rise is unlikely to happen any time soon. According to Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to accountancy firm EY: “A rate rise is unlikely to happen until the latter part of 2016.” A rise of even 0.25pc – the Bank of England is expected to hike rates very gradually – could spook consumers, and hit spending levels in the UK Nevertheless, it seems a worthwhile exercise to try to forecast the impact – or fallout – of a rate rise, as we are just delaying the inevitable. Insolvency trade body R3 has now done the number-crunching – and it’s not pretty. Nearly one in five British businesses will be put in financial difficulty by an interest rate rise, it has said in its latest Business Distress Index. This may not seem like a huge number – 19pc – but that’s still around 385,000 small businesses. The survey was based on responses from 500 business leaders, but the impact of an interest rates rise may be more pronounced than many expect. A rise of even 0.25pc – the Bank of England is expected to hike rates very gradually – could spook consumers, and hit spending levels in the UK. The nation’s spenders make up 60pc of the UK economy and when they stop flashing the cash, retailers will be the first to feel it. \"There's no question that when interest rates need to rise, growth in consumer spending will moderate,\" Simon Wolfson, chief executive of clothing retailer Next, told Reuters earlier this month. • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: Should small businesses borrow money to grow?
