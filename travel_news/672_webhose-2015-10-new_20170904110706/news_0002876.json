For greater Phoenix , short haul flights will operate four times a week on each route between Scottsdale Airport and San Diego , Las Vegas , and Puerto Penasco . For greater Los Angeles , ultra long haul flights will operate four times a week on each route between Bob Hope Burbank Airport and Shanghai , Seoul , and Singapore .\nAll routes are FBO to FBO (Fixed Base Operator) meaning that this commercial scheduled passenger airline travels from private terminal to private terminal. JetPurple is basically \"private jet travel for the public\" as the company's new slogan proclaims. The announcement of six routes for service commencing in 2016, follows JetPurple's first scheduled public charter route of commercial passenger airline service which launched on May 24, 2012 between Chicago's Midway International Airport and Manistee, Michigan's Blacker Airport.\nAs a commercial scheduled passenger airline, JetPurple operates uniquely under FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) regulation part 135 as opposed to FAA part 121, and is directly regulated by the USDOT (United States Department of Transportation) as a public charter. With its innovative airline business model JetPurple provides passengers greater financial protection and streamlined travel convenience that is vastly better than the old airlines. JetPurple also employs an aircraft fleet ownership strategy of acquiring only best in class airliners for all its routes. This helps create a highly reliable and ultra safe air service as these aircraft are the most dependable Tier 1 commercial aircraft in the world.\n\"As a next generation airline JetPurple is a smarter choice in commercial scheduled passenger air travel than the old airlines. Plane power to the people!\"\n- Adam Blumenkranz , Founder & CEO\nAbout JETPURPLE\nJetPurple ( www.jetpurple.com ) is a commercial scheduled passenger airline with a truly disruptive business model, providing a private jet charter travel experience to the general public, sold one plane ticket at a time.
