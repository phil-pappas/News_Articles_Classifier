Airlines that are now extinct (CNN) - \nUS Airways, which started as a tiny airmail service 76 years ago, is retiring as part of a 2013 merger with American Airlines and the final flight will take off from Philadelphia on Friday. Related Content The best inflight experiences money can buy \nIt's a small part of a huge trend that's affecting how more than 660 million domestic air travelers fly every year. \nFourteen years ago, the United States had 10 major domestic airlines. Now, the competing major carriers have merged into four: American, Delta, Southwest and United. \nTogether, they control about 87% of the domestic market, MIT's International Center for Air Transportation said. \nIs that a good thing for travelers looking for lower airfares? \n\"I don't think it's bad at all,\" said Brett Snyder of airline industry blog The Cranky Flier. \"Fares have come down lately. You still see these guys fighting with each other. But is there as much competition as there was? No, of course not, because there are fewer carriers.\" \nSnyder, who spent more than a decade working for United, USAir and America West, called it \"rational competition\" among \"smarter airlines\" that know how to make a profit. \"I guess from the customers' standpoint, you could argue that it would be better to have 20 tiny airlines losing money and taking you places cheap. But that's not sustainable.\" \nFolks who think airfares are too high may be interested to know that domestic air travel is 17% cheaper in inflation-adjusted dollars than it was more than 20 years ago, according to federal statistics. But we also have to pay extra on some carriers to check bags and get seat assignments, which used to be included in the price of a ticket. \nAlso notable is that the Justice Department is investigating \"possible unlawful coordination\" of seat availability by airlines, allegedly to prop up ticket prices. \nWhat about services? \nTravelers give mixed signals about airline service. \nSometimes, the feedback is good: A J.D. Power and Associates passenger survey of airlines in North America released in May showed a record high satisfaction ranking for in-flight services; boarding, deplaning and baggage; flight crew; aircraft; check-in; and reservations. \nBut sometimes, the feedback is not so good: The number of passenger complaints to the Department of Transportation is up. \nIt really is a different world now, compared with the days before the federal government deregulated the airline industry in 1978. \nBack then, authorities could set fares and choose routes. That made it hard for airlines to fill all the seats on every flight. \n\"In the old days, it seemed like there was always a seat next to you that was empty, and people took that for granted,\" said transportation expert Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution Washington think tank. \"Today, you laugh and say, 'wait a minute, what kind of rat ship were they running then?' \" \nAre we better off now? \"In the long run, yes,\" Winston said. \n'A golden time' \nTo get a taste for air travel before deregulation, meet Capt. William Compton. \nIn 1968, Compton began a decadeslong career flying for the iconic Trans World Airlines, aka TWA. \nThe passenger experience on TWA and other major airlines \"was really, really good,\" he recalled. \"Service was fantastic. People got on the airplane with a coat and tie. The seats were wider and longer. The food was better. It was a golden time.\" \nA lot of airlines in the old days \"weren't making any money, but they were producing a great product,\" Compton, now retired, said last week from his Florida home. \nTWA was an airline that pretty much showed America how to travel by airplane. It was the innovator. In 1930, it launched one of the first scheduled coast-to-coast passenger airline flights. It was among the first airlines to fly four-engine planes with pressurized cabins that could soar high above bad weather. It basically invented in-flight dining, figuring out the best way to offer every passenger a fancy meal, served with cloth napkins, tablecloths, real silverware and china. \nSome of us domestic air travelers have seen these things only on YouTube. For us, a three-course meal on a domestic flight amounts to a packet of King's Honey Roasted Peanuts, a Biscoff cookie and a tomato juice in a plastic cup. \nIn the '60s and '70s, \"people wanted excellent service, so they had to pay more,\" Compton said. \"Now, people don't want to pay more, they want to pay less, which makes sense.\" That prompts airlines to fill every seat to keep prices low. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:21:36.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
