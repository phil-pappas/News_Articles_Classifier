Adun Somnuk said. She then hit another person in front, he said.\nThe staff rushed her to a hospital where they told doctors only that she had passed out while zip-lining, Adun told The Associated Press. But an autopsy later showed the woman, who was a doctor, had suffered a broken neck, he said.\nOfficers sent to inspect the zip-line operation are questioning the staff and witnesses, he said, adding that the staff could be charged with causing death by negligence if there is enough evidence.\nTwo other zip-line accidents have occurred in Chiang Mai this year. In July, an American tourist broke several ribs after colliding with a Chinese tourist on a zip line. In June, a Chinese tourist fell to his death while sliding through a zip line due to a safety lock malfunction.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:51:09.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
