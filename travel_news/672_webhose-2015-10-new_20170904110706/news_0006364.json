The centre will occupy two floors of a detached building in Shire Park, a major corporate business park on the outskirts of the city. The nearby railway station and A1 motorway provide excellent transport li \nThe site will offer a range of flexible working options for businesses and professionals including meeting rooms which are bookable by the hour, a drop-in business lounge, office space, day offices and virtual office services. Demand for flexible workspace is growing steadily, as businesses aim to save money on lengthy leases and give employees greater freedom in where and when they work. Research from Regus shows that 40% of UK workers spend at least 2.5 days per week working outside of their main office. Similarly, a third of UK employers are offering their staff more flexible working options. Technology makes it possible to ‘work anywhere’, yet most people prefer an office-style environment to remain productive, motivated and disciplined. Richard Morris, UK CEO, Regus, comments: “The opening of our first location in Welwyn Garden City testifies to the area’s need for cost-effective workspace that match today’s flexible workforce. We know that more and more people are working flexibly, instead of the traditional 9-5 in the office, and we are seeing month-on-month growth in interest in flexible working options which provide a more agile alternative to fixed offices.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:17:33.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
