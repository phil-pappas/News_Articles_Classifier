From the launch of its very first ‘Transatlantic Fashion Week’ to a culinary tour of the British Isles to the largest Big Band Balls at sea, guests on each cruise will be immersed in the very best of these themes.\nThe inaugural ‘Transatlantic Fashion Week’ voyage arrives in one of the style capitals of the world, New York, the very same day New York Fashion Week 2016 begins, after an extra special 7 night ( 1-8 September ) voyage across the Atlantic on board the most famous ocean liner in the world.\nThe voyage will be hosted by a number of very significant names from the industry, as guests will be treated to ‘an audience with’ pioneering British designer, Dame Zandra Rhodes CBE, Colin McDowell, the highly respected fashion historian and commentator and Fern Mallis, the ‘Godmother of Fashion’ and founder of New York Fashion Week. Dame Zandra Rhodes, who has dressed some the world’s most iconic stars and musicians, including Freddie Mercury and Jackie Onassis, said:\n“I’m extremely excited to be joining Cunard on board Queen Mary 2 for the very first Transatlantic Fashion Week, 2016. For me, it offers the opportunity to share my knowledge and wonderful experiences from throughout my career in fashion, and give guests a taste of what my collection has to offer.”\nDame Zhandra Rhodes will also reveal designs from her collections, as emerging faces from Storm modelling agency take to the catwalk, on board Queen Mary 2 during the voyage. Alongside these great fashion authorities, guests will also have the opportunity to meet the designers of the future, as students from the world’s number one postgraduate fashion programme, based in the world’s number one university of art and design, The Royal College of Art, showcase their latest collections on board.\nFood lovers can treat themselves to a British Isles Culinary Discovery on board Queen Elizabeth in June next year. The cruise will feature highly reputable names and producers from the world of gastronomy, including Charles Sichel of Maison Sichel and Jilly Goolden, English Wine Critic and UK Television personality. Guests will be able to enjoy regional delicacies from around the British Isles through a range of tailored shore-side excursions, hosted on board events and specially curated menus.\nEach of the three Cunard Queens will host their very own Big Band Balls in November 2016 for dance and music lovers around the world to enjoy. Cunard’s biggest orchestras of the year will delight guests with music from Glenn Miller, Count Basie and Duke Ellington. The big band phenomena originated in the US in the 20s era, and soon took the world by storm by creating the party of all parties. Next year each of the three Queens will look forward to playing host to their own exclusive musical spectaculars.\nAngus Struthers, Cunard’s Marketing Director, said:\n“Cunard has as its heart a celebrated history of guests dressing with style and a sense of occasion, as well as some of the finest dining at sea and of course the glamour of music and dance in the largest ball rooms at sea. These very special cruises are sure to entice our most dedicated travellers and those new to cruising who are looking to immerse themselves in the very best of British fashion and food. Dance and music lovers can look forward to being transformed to an era where elaborate Big Band Balls ruled the social circuits, as we celebrate 2016 in style.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:37:22.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
