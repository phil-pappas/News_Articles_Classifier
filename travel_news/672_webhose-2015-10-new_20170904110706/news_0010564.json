A number of travel exhibitors and visitors based interstate, have already expressed their interest in participating in Melbourne, in addition to Sydney. \nHead of Portfolio Development, David McCarthy commented, “Following on from the successful 2015 event in Sydney, The Travel Industry Exhibition will be coming to both Sydney and Melbourne next year. Both exhibitions will focus on the latest innovations and trends in destinations, accommodation, air services, technology, cruising, tours, recruitment, industry organisations and more.“ \nFurther saying, “Bringing together all travel industry verticals under the one roof provides a unique opportunity for professionals to connect in a neutral space, outside of PSAs. The event purposefully provides a key forum to shape the industry’s future through networking and education.” \nExhibitors at The Travel Industry Exhibition are provided with the ultimate environment to showcase their products and services to the travel community. \nComplementing the exhibition will be the highly acclaimed two-day educational program, set to feature the industry’s leading experts in the field. \nThe program will be developed in consultation with the Australian Federation of Travel Agents (AFTA) and the AFTA Travel Accreditation Scheme (ATAS). \nGeneral Manager, AFTA, Gary O’Riordan expressed his delight in supporting the event, “AFTA has chosen to be the Industry Supporter of the Travel Industry Exhibition. We are delighted to assist in the development of the education component of the event which will provide relevant information for travel agents and industry suppliers.” \nMr O’Riordan continues, “AFTA is committed to increasing the industry’s education, training and professionalism. By showcasing expert speakers the event will provide key insights and contacts to help grow your business. We are helping to promote the Travel Industry Exhibition via our communication channels and look forward to networking with our industry colleagues during the event.” \nThe interactive and informative sessions will reflect key topics at the forefront of industry, such as traveller trends, online competition, travel marketing solutions and operational insights per sector. \nThis learning enables travel professionals to develop their knowledge and skills, giving them practical tools to take back to the office and implement in their own careers. \nThe Travel Industry Exhibition will also host an exciting and elaborate event, Travel Daily’s Christmas in July. The event will take place at the conclusion of the first day of the show in both Melbourne and Sydney, and is expected to connect Australia’s travel community together in a meaningful and social manner. \nThe Travel Industry Exhibition will take place in Melbourne at Peninsula, Docklands on Monday 11 to Tuesday 12 July 2016. \nThe Travel Industry Exhibition Sydney will take place the following week on Monday 18 to Tuesday 19 July 2016 at Luna Park, Sydney.
