As of Sept. 18, Croatian Railways suspended trains heading to and from Slovenia and Serbia, which also affects travel to destinations in Austria and Germany. Because the situation may change with little notice, tourists are advised to check rail and bus websites regularly for updated information or schedules.\nCosta Rica: The U.S. State Department released a security message for tourists, citing a small but steady increase in violent crime in and around the country's capital, San Jose. Among the crimes are daytime shootings between local crime and narcotics organizations in neighborhoods south and east of the city. Though American tourists have not been specific targets, travelers are urged to use caution and to be aware of surroundings while visiting the city.\nGuatemala: Health officials urge tourists to use added protection against mosquito bites to avoid dengue fever, a mosquito-borne virus that may cause high fever, pain in the eyes, dizziness, nausea and body aches for as long as two weeks. There is no vaccine or treatment for dengue, but tourists can protect themselves by using insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and using mosquito nets while sleeping.\nIceland: Tourists soon may have additional expenses while visiting, as the country's environment minister considers tolls and parking fees at tourist sites. With more than a million people visiting the country each year, the fees would support the upkeep and preservation of many popular but environmentally fragile destinations. Any increase in fees would be implemented in 2016.\nIndia: A Japanese tourist fell to his death at the Taj Mahal's Royal Gate after attempting to take a selfie earlier in September. Although many of the mausoleum's 12,000 daily guests visit without incident, accidents and injuries resulting from tourists attempting selfies are increasing.\nCompiled from news services and travel sources.
