Chew Gum \nHow often do you start getting \"hungry\" while you're working? Eating is a great escape to monotony and boredom. In addition to distraction, writing crushes potential for flow when you're overly full and bloated. \nChewing gum alleviates this challenge. \nResearchers had two groups of 20 people each listen to a 30-minute recording that included a sequence of numbers. After listening, the participants were asked to remember the sequence. One group was chewing gum while the control group was not. The gum chewers had higher accuracy rates and faster reaction times than the non-gum chewers. \nChewing gum while working has two key benefits then: Increased focus and it stops you from eating out of boredom. \n6. Do The Worst, First \nWillpower is like a muscle that depletes when it is exercised. Similarly, our ability to make high quality decisions becomes fatigued over time. The more decisions you make, the lower quality they become -- the weaker your willpower. \nConsequently, you need to do the hard stuff first thing in the morning. The important stuff. If you don't, it simply will not get done. By the end of your day, you'll be exhausted. You'll be fried. There will be a million reasons to just start tomorrow. And you will start tomorrow --which is never. \nSo your mantra becomes: The worst comes first . Do that thing you've been needing to do. Then do it again tomorrow. \nIf you take just one step toward your big goals every day, you'll realize those goals weren't really far away. \n7. Embrace Stress And Recovery \nPeople struggle drastically to detach from work. More now than ever, we fail to live presently. Our loved ones are lucky to experience a small percentage of our attention while they're with us. \nWhen you focus on results, rather than being busy, you're 100 percent ON when you're working and 100 percent OFF when you're not. This not only allows you to be present in the moment, but allows you the needed time to rest and recover. The higher quality your recovery, the better you'll be at your work. \nYour ability to work at a high level is like fitness. If you never took a break between sets, you wouldn't be able to build strength, stamina, and endurance. Recovery is just as important as intensive training for growth. \n8. Condition Yourself With Punishments And Rewards \nA famous study depicting conditioned behavior is known as \"Pavlov's Dogs.\" The psychologist, Ivan Pavlov noticed that dogs salivate when they are given food. \nHe discovered that any object or event associated with food would trigger the dogs to salivate. So he started ringing a bell before bringing the food into the dogs. After a while, the dogs would salivate whenever a bell was rung, even when no food was brought. \nUnlike dogs, humans can consciously choose the behaviors they want conditioned--like focus and optimal performance. We can even create our own triggers. The best athletes and performers in the world have pre-performance routines that trigger flow, which is peak focus. \nIn addition to pre-performance routines, punishments and highly motivating rewards can condition you to stay focused. \nIf you don't get that project done by a certain date, you owe $500 to your friend. Or, if you get it done, you will reward yourself by going out to your favorite restaurant. It doesn't matter what the punishments and rewards are, as long as they motivate you enough. \n9. Orient Your Life Toward Outputs Rather Than Inputs \nFor most Americans, the first thing our morning eyes see is a digital screen...usually texts or emails. In spare seconds, we check newsfeeds and tweets. We're addicted to input. Or in other words, we're addicted to reactively being guided by other people's agendas.Instead of living a consciously organized life, we relentlessly react. \nOn the other hand, Josh Waitzkin, author of The Art of Learning , wakes up and immediately writes in his journal for 30 minutes. He does this to process what his subconscious mind has been brewing, scheming, problem-solving, and learning in the night. When Josh wakes up, he rushes to a quiet place and engages in a burst of intellectual and creative flow. \nSimilarly, while Greg McKeown was writing Essentialism , he wrote from 5 a.m. to 1 p.m., during which time he didn't check his email, social media, or phone. He didn't even receive interruptions from his family until his workday was finished. \nCreatives focus on outputs. In their free moments, creatives utilize their subconscious breakthroughs. Their days are filled with creative bursts, making them incredible at their craft. If you want to have more creative flow in your life, stop compulsively checking your social media and email. Check them once or twice per day. Detach from the addiction to numb your mind and escape reality. Instead, get lost in the creative projects you've always wanted to do. \n10. Work On Multiple Project Types \nAccording to neuroscience research, novelty activates specific brain systems, foremost among them the dopamine system which makes you feel happy. So, when you perform the same routine every day, your work can get stale, prompting--often frequent--creative blocks. The novelty disappears. Consequently, working on multiple projects is an effective way to experience novelty in your art, and thus, an enhanced flood of dopamine. \nMultiple projects not only make you happier, but research finds multitasking can boost creative output, if done the right way. Doing one activity for an extended period of time is less effective for creative output than switching back and forth between creative tasks. However, switching back and forth between a creative task and a passive one (such as eating, talking, reading, or watching something) generates the largest creative outputs. \nThe mind can get stuck circling the same cognitive pathways over and over. When working on a single problem continuously, you can become fixated on previous solutions. Yet, when you step away from the activity, your mind releases from the fixation and the old pathways fade from your memory. In the meantime, new possibilities are incubated subconsciously--leading to ah-ha moments. \nIn light of this, I've been varying my creative projects. Aside from my PhD research, I'm developing online courses and doing journalistic writing (like this). I'm also creatively invested in my family and church. My time away from each project is essential to the completion of them all. When I return to a certain project, I see it with fresh eyes and take the current draft to a higher level. \nFollow Benjamin Hardy on Twitter: www.twitter.com/BenjaminPHardy More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:15:46.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
