The event will take place in Singapore on October 5 and 6, 2015. \n\nSteven Dixon, TNZ's regional manager for South and South-east Asia, said the increase in Singaporean visitors to New Zealand highlights the country’s growing appeal as a travel destination. He added that around half of the travellers over the past 12 months were repeat visitors. \n\n“Kiwi Link brings together Singaporean tourism product managers and planners with New Zealand tourism operators, allowing us to raise awareness of New Zealand’s many offerings as a travel destination,” Dixon explained. \n\nDorothy Cheong, a product manager from Dynasty Travel International who will be attending the event, said: “Kiwi Link allows us to engage with New Zealand travel operators to understand more about what the country has to offer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:01:13.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
