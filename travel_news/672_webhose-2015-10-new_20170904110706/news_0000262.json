What’s less clear is whether travel managers feel they have the right technology and tools needed to deliver this future.”\nCommunication \nThe study showed that the balance between savings and service is expected to change significantly over the next couple of years as buyers look to traveller behaviour rather than supplier cost reductions to drive savings.\nHowever, it also shows the communication tools to drive compliance are often missing - 44 per cent of respondents said they have no formal systems in place for gathering feedback from their travellers.\n“Communication is critical for building relationships, engagement and compliance. The research suggests there’s scope for travel managers to upgrade their communications systems and practice,” Strachan added.\nWhile 75% of buyers surveyed see improved traveller service as a route to savings, few organisations have measures in place to justify these improvements to procurement or finance leaders. It found 21 per cent of respondents use traveller productivity metrics, 9 per cent use work-life balance metrics and just 5 per cent use stress reduction metrics. However, 12 per cent said they plan to introduce stress reduction metrics in the next 1 - 2 years.\nACTE executive director Greeley Koch said the study confirms a major shift among buyers who are putting a stronger emphasis on supporting the traveller in meeting corporate objectives as opposed to savings alone.\nAmong the traveller considerations featured in the research are initiatives for improved traveller service:\n\n· Pre-trip messaging: 30 per cent of organisations have already deployed these services, and 27 per cent aim to introduce them in the next 1 – 2 years.\n\n· Mobile booking: 29 per cent of organisations have mobile booking today. A further 30 per cent of buyers plan to implement within 1 – 2 years.\n\n· Mobile Apps for in-trip changes: Deployed in just 16 per cent of organisations today, but over the next 1 -2 years, 31 per cent plan to implement.\nACTE surveyed 350 buyers from around the world during two weeks in August. It also hosted focus groups with buyers to help design the research. The research was unveiled at the ACTE conference in Paris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:16:25.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
