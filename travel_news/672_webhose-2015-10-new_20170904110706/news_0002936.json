Its commitment to preserving and enriching the natural environment, the efficiency in its use of resources and the way it embraces both the local community and its own staff was evident when Mission Hills Haikou hosted the highly-successful IAGTO Asia Golf Tourism Convention in 2014. It is not only showing the way for Asia but is also a wonderful example for how courses around the world can operate in harmony with the environment.”\nDr Ken Chu, Chairman of Mission Hills Group, said: “We are honoured to receive this award, which is testament to our commitment in the fields of environmental and social responsibility.\n \n“In this day and age, the importance of respecting and working with the environment cannot be over-stated, especially in regard to water conservation.\n \n“It is also gratifying to be acknowledged for the resort’s work across community and employee engagement, which are crucial elements to the success of any organisation.\n \n“I know that my father and the founder of Mission Hills, the late Dr David Chu, would have been extremely proud that Mission Hills is being recognised for this award and also for the unstinting efforts of all those connected with Mission Hills.”\n \nJonathan Smith, GEO’s Chief Executive, said: “All entries to the 2016 IAGTO Sustainability Awards have been outstanding. Each club has shown its commitment to the three core pillars of sustainable golf: people, nature and resource efficiency.\n“We are delighted to see such a strength of innovative, impressive and practical actions throughout the applications.\n“Mission Hills Haikou stands out as a leader in the Asia region. We are impressed with their work across community and employee engagement, resource efficiency, particularly water conservation, and in protecting and enhancing native habits, including their annual tree planting programme.\n“On behalf of IAGTO, GEO and all our partners worldwide I am delighted to congratulate them for this well-earned and deserved award and we look forward to seeing them continue to raise the bar in the future.”\n \nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:25:14.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
