Schools that have reached the finals performed for the audience before winners were announced. \nAmong those enjoying the performances were the island's Minister for Tourism and Culture, Alain St.Ange, and the Principal Secretary for Culture, Benjamine Rose, along with parents, teachers, and a large crowd. \nThe performers amazed their audience with their creativity and skills with the drama pieces, dance performances and songs, and colorful outfits. The décor of the stage for the various performances also added a special touch to the show. Schools that reached the finals had to go through an eliminatory stage in the various categories. \nFor the short drama and storytelling performances, various themes were explored such as the local Leve Debrouye theme which was a call to boost productivity in the country, protection from rats and leptospirosis, and even themes such as love were being expressed. \nStudents also showed their patriotism and love for Seychelles by expressing it in their songs, with some even reflecting the national theme “I Love Seychelles.” \nMinister St.Ange said the students have demonstrated a great level of creativity, adding that it was also encouraging to see them putting forward the country’s culture in their various performances.
