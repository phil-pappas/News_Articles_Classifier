A motion was also passed calling upon Uber to cease operating Uber while new regulations are drafted. Uber responded in a statement saying they did not intend to obey the law. \n\"We are not asking for any new laws or regulations. We are simply asking officials to enforce the laws which already exist. City by-law officers could more aggressively enforce the by-laws; Toronto police are not enforcing the Highway Traffic Act. Two weeks ago, Guelph police charged five UberX drivers with violating Section 39.1 of the Highway Traffic Act in one day.\" \nWhile Mayor Tory claims Toronto does not have the resources to stop Uber, Moini points out that other jurisdictions have found better solutions than a car-by-car check: \"France arrested the top Uber executives who refused to obey French law; Montreal police began impounding UberX cars, and drivers got the message very quickly. \"Why is Toronto not doing this?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:28:18.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
