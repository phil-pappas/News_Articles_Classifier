But it is the final resting place of several painters, composers, writers and other artists, testament to Montmartre's Bohemian past.\nA map to the most famous graves is available online, http://equipement.paris.fr/cimetiere-de-montmartre-5061 . Click the last entry, \"Map of Montmartre Cemetery (English),\" to get the document.\nSome of the cemetery's most famous residents include composers Hector Berlioz (\"Symphonie Fantastique\") and Jacques Offenbach (\"The Tales of Hoffman\"). Dancer Rudolf Nijinsky is here as is Edgar Degas, famous for his paintings of ballet dancers. Also: Adolphe Sax, inventor of the saxophone.\nIn a neat little bit of literary history, you can find the grave of Alexandre Dumas, who wrote \"The Three Musketeers,\" as well as the grave of Alphonsine Plessis, the courtesan who was the inspiration for Dumas' \"La Dame Aux Camelias.\" The tragic story laid the foundations for the opera \"La Traviata,\" and the movie \"Camille.\"\nAnd if you don't feel like tracking down graves, this is also a perfectly good place to simply wander, investigating memorials that catch your eye, like the full-size statute of a man atop the grave of Jean Bauchet. Not a household name, but he was a manager of the Moulin Rouge, the famous cabaret, just a short walk away.\nWalking back to Boulevard Clichy from the cemetery entrance you will find Corcoran's Irish Pub, http://placedeclichy.corcoransirishpub.fr/. It's a good place to toast the ghosts of Montmartre.\n___\nIf You Go...\nMONTMARTRE CEMETERY: 20 avenue Rachel, Paris; http://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71184/Cimetiere-de-Montmartre.
