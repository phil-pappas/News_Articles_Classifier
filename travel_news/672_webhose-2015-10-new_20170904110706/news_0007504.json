Airport\nAs airports continue to remodel themselves to better reflect their destination, local chefs from Rick Bayless in Chicago and Michael Voltaggio in Los Angeles have opened gate-side restaurants. Now fliers traveling through Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport just outside of Washington, D.C., can skip Starbucks and dine at the new Kapnos Taverna, a Greek restaurant from the chef Mike Isabella. A more casual iteration of his original Kapnos Taverna in Arlington, Va., the airport location serves flatbread with dips like tzatziki and hummus, Mediterranean small plates such as roasted cauliflower, and more flight-sustaining fare including lamb chops.\nAir China Comes to Newark\nBeginning today, Air China will begin new direct service between Newark and Beijing. The New Jersey flights, which start at $848 round trip, will take place four times weekly — Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays — on Boeing 777-300ER jets.

Premium Economy offers 40 percent more space compared with Economy. Air France began running the new jets in summer 2014 and expects to have 44 of them in service by July 2016.
