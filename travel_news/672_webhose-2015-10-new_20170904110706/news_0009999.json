Orlando, FL, October 08, 2015 --( PR.com )-- For efforts to establish the Dominican Republic into a reputable Caribbean destination for health and wellness seekers, Dr. Alejandro Cambiaso, chief of International and Preventive Services at Hospital General de la Plaza de la Salud, has been recognized as a Medical Tourism Leader of the Year, the Medical Tourism Association® announced.Cambiaso, president of the Dominican Medical Tourism Association, helped to coordinate International Patient Services Certification® (IPSC) with the Medical Tourism Association for Hospital General de la Plaza de la Salud, which became the first healthcare provider in the Dominican Republic to achieve such a distinction, said Renée-Marie Stephano, president of the Medical Tourism Association®, at the 4th annual awards ceremony during the 8th World Medical Tourism and Global Healthcare Congress, Sept. 27-30, 2015, in Orlando, Fla.“Incorporating healthcare into the ‘tourism’ equation makes perfect sense,” she said. “When patients contemplate treatment abroad, hospital accreditation is of primary concern and, often times, a starting point for choosing a destination. Confidence in services based on validated continuous education, quality and proven outcomes will attract more international patients to Hospital General, serve as a model for local healthcare providers to follow and strengthen economic initiatives designed to promote medical tourism to the Dominican Republic.”Dr. Cambiaso president of the Asociación Dominicana de Turismo de la Salud (ADTS) and a member of the Medical Tourism Association® Advisory Board, said strategies to build health tourism in the Dominican Republic must include international partners and public and private alliances.“The main focus needs to be on the patient experience including quality, safety and outcomes,” said Dr. Cambiaso, who co-authored the “Dominican Republic Health & Tourism Destination Guide,” a reference publication released this year featuring the top hospitals, hotels, airports recovery and wellness centers, financial institutions and investment opportunities on an island that boasts the largest economy in both the Caribbean and Central America. “Education and training is an important first step toward unifying those goals.”The World Medical Tourism & Global Healthcare Congress accepts nominations to honor leadership, innovation, education, service and top facilities and destinations in the care and treatment of both international- and domestic-traveling patients.
