Is there any cruise company that has cabins to accommodate three people on this route? Stockholm, Sweden Photo: AP/FOTOLIA Jane Archer, cruise expert, replies A lot of ships have cabins for three people. The third person sleeps on a sofa bed, or on a bed that opens out of the wall or ceiling. The bed is made up in the evening by the room steward and folded away in the morning. It will be cramped, so choose the biggest cabin or suite you can afford. Holland America Line ( hollandamerica.com ), Princess Cruises ( princess.com ), Cunard ( cunard.co.uk ) and P&O Cruises ( pocruises.com ) have Baltic cruises and ships with three-berth cabins. A 16-night Baltic cruise with P&O round-trip from Southampton departing August 22 costs from £4,918 for three adults sharing. Next year, the company has a 14-night voyage from Southampton departing May 23 from £3,507 for three people. Copenhagen, Denmark Photo: AP/FOTOLIA You might alternatively consider booking three single cabins. Cruise & Maritime Voyages ( cruiseandmaritime.com ) has set aside 150 cabins on Magellan for single use. The cost is from £1,919 per person for a 12-night voyage round-trip from Tilbury departing September 6 this year. Over-50s specialist Saga Cruises ( saga.co.uk/cruises ) has a 15-night cruise from Dover to the Baltic on Saga Pearl II departing in May 2016.
