Built less than a year ago, the one-bedroom, two-bathroom villa starts at $968 per night and features a sprawling open concept, a king-size bed imported from Bali, a bathroom with double sinks, floor-to-ceiling glass windows, a 24-hour concierge, and a gourmet kitchen for home cooking or meals prepared by a private chef. An all-glass, retracting wall in the living room offers prime views of the pool, which seemingly melds into the Caribbean Sea beyond it. \nThe outdoor patio, equipped with a couch and lounge chairs, offers an optimal place to share drinks and watch the fiery sun disappear behind the tropical waters. Nearby, the white sand of Lorient Beach and a great reef break beckon sun worshippers and surfers alike, while the Grand Cul de Sac lagoon is the ideal location for kite-surfing lessons, jet skiing, and paddleboarding. The beachside restaurant La Gloriette—offering traditional Caribbean cuisine, such as mahi-mahi, conch-shell stew, and grilled calamari—is also easily accessible. Those who value privacy but also wish to travel with friends or family can rent Sibarth’s Villa Domingue next door, together with Villa BelAmour.
