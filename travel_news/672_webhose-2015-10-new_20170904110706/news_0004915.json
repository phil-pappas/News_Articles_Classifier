The closest international airport is Adelaide, more than 2000km away.\nQantas currently flies the world’s longest route on its Sydney to Dallas-Fort Worth leg , covering 13,800km in around 14 hours.\nThis year Emirates announced it was planning to topple Qantas from its mantle with a flight from Dubai to Panama to begin in February 2016 flying more than 13,821km on a Boeing 777-200LR. However Air India is set to eclipse that flight with a 14,003km direct flight from Bengaluru to San Francisco.\nQantas has eight 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft on order to replace its 747 jumbo jets.\nOriginally published as Qantas plans non-stop flight to London Jump back to top", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/travel/travel-news/qantas-celebrates-a380-flights-from-sydney-to-dallasfort-worth-the-worlds-biggest-plane-on-worlds-longest-route/story-fnjjv9zk-1227073738779", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/4182a52cc1982d37338a7dd469773956?domain=newscorpaustralia.com", "http://www.eharmony.com.au/partner/news/?cid=116562&aid=100&utm_source=news.com.au&utm_medium=Widget&utm_campaign=Kimmy_Widget", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://atwonline.com/airports-routes/joyce-qantas-eyes-perth-london-nonstop-services", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/travel/travel-news/how-far-will-they-go-the-race-for-the-longest-direct-flights/story-fni0bien-1227544023993?sv=5b197996e5fd97c849d625cac5b92ade", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2c913d1aa2e48793c02c49fde6957633", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:38:04.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
