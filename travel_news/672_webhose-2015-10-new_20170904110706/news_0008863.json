With 91 international and 20 domestic destinations around five continents, operated with one of the youngest fleet in the industry, which is below 5 years average age; we will continue our leadership in the African Aviation industry and connecting mother Africa with its major global trading centers. . I wish to thank our customers for their strong vote of confidence and for all Ethiopian employees who are working hard day-in and day-out all over the world to make Ethiopian airlines lead the African Renaissance in the 21st Century with its motto “The New Spirit of Africa”.\n \n \nSource:-Ethiopian Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:04:37.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
