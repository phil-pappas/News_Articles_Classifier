Gaining an international reputation for its fresh air, pristine environment and spectacular local produce, Tasmania now adds World Class Golf Destination to its list of growing accolades.\nSelected from over 60 destinations globally, the award for Undiscovered Golf Destination of the Year is judged by over 200 of the world’s leading golf travel journalists located across 36 countries. Judges based their decision on a selection of criteria including; the extent to which the golfing destination is undiscovered, attractiveness of the region and courses, speed of play, climate and accessibility.\nIAGTO Chief Executive Peter Walton said the Island was a worthy recipient of the award, with the state causing a buzz in golfing circles around the world.\n“Tasmania richly deserves being named Undiscovered Golf Destination of the Year in the 2016 IAGTO Awards. To earn such an accolade is no mean feat.” He said.\n“The winner is voted for by members of the International Golf Travel Writers Association, which is administered by IAGTO. Where they go, golf travellers follow, spurred on by the prospect of discovering a new gem after reading about it in respected golf publications or online. Tasmania is now well and truly on the global golfing map thanks to this award and I am sure it will result in an increase in golfers from other parts of the world wanting to play the lush fairways and greens of this pristine island” said Walton.\nIt is not the first time Tasmania’s golf courses have received global accolades. The two courses at Barnbougle, on Tasmania’s north east coast, are both rated in the top 25 courses in the world by US Golf Digest. Barnbougle Dunes and Lost Farm are also members of the Great Golf Courses of Australia, the international marketing partnership with Tourism Australia and Tourism Tasmania.\nChief Executive of Tourism Tasmania, John Fitzgerald said that this accolade from the International Association of Golf Tour Operators is a welcome acknowledgement of Tasmania’s growing world-class golf offering.\n“Recent developments have certainly raised awareness of Tasmania as a golfing destination.\n“However, I believe it is our incredible natural features, heritage, world-class produce, wines, beers and whiskies, and the welcoming and engaging nature of our people that have elevated our island’s status as a golfing destination that surpasses every serious golfer’s expectations,” he said.\nThe IAGTO Awards announcement caps off an impressive year for Tasmania’s trophy cabinet, with Travel + Leisure readers propelling Tasmania to the heights of world’s fourth best island, and Lonely Planet naming the island fourth most desirable region in the world to visit in 2015. Raising the island’s clean air, premium eats and drinks, friendly locals, and accessible wilds, Tasmania is now welcoming visitors in unprecedented numbers.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:48:55.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
