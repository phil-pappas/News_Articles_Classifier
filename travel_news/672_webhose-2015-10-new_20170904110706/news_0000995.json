Expert Videos \nThe first time I saw the Dutch national soccer team playing in the World Cup, I wondered -- as many people do -- \"What's the deal with all the fans wearing orange?\" The colors of the Dutch flag are red, white and blue -- there's no orange at all. So what's the Netherlands' relationship (make that borderline obsession) with the color orange? \nThe answer: Orange is the color of the Dutch Royal Family. The lineage of the current dynasty -- the House of Oranje-Nassau -- dates back to Willem van Oranje (William of Orange). But while the color orange has royal roots in the Netherlands, today it symbolizes a broader pride in the country and in being Dutch. \nPerhaps the biggest display of orange national pride occurs on Koninginnedag (\"Queen's Day\") , the April 30 holiday commemorating the birthday the country's (former) Queen. You'll be hard-pressed to find a Dutch person who's not sporting the color on this day.
