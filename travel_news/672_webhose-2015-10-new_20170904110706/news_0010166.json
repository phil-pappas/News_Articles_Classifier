His father Des had played rugby for Ireland and his mother Andrea was an international netball player, so they knew what it would take. Des even encouraged him to use a sports psychologist, because he believed in it. I was responsible for teaching Luke balance and coordination from a very young age, mainly in Gaelic football. Quite a lot of rugby players started in Gaelic football. There are a lot of similarities. The main feature was obviously catching and running and Luke had that from a very young age. School support: pupils wish Luke good luck But what he also had, that he was actually very good at, was making quick decisions, knowing what to do with the ball. The opposition couldn’t manage him. He won a lot of medals and his team won the national competition at 12 years of age. Ambitious from the start I had this after­school academy of excellence, in hurling and Gaelic football. I would not have envisaged Luke being interested in hurling and I was afraid that because of the skill level, he might not be able to adapt. You need hand-eye­coordination. It's one of the most skilful games around, on a par with hockey but played at a faster tempo and with a lot more contact. But Luke was mad keen to get into it and six weeks later he was as good as any of the other lads. I said to Luke one day when he was 11: “You're doing very well. You've adapted the skills, you're really getting there.” He said: “Eddie, I won't get there until I'm at the level of Keraghan.” Keraghan had been playing eight years and was known as one of the top hurlers in Ireland. Luke always saw himself in a very competitive manner. He wanted to be the best. But he was very much a team player as well. I've always believed in wanting to pass that on and Luke is a great example to the boys and girls I coach, here at his old Irish­speaking primary school in Cork. They wanted to send Luke a message this weekend when he plays against Italy in Rugby World Cup 2015 . So here it is, a poem I wrote called Luke The Lion . • Now read Eddie's first blog: Luke Fitzgerald never forgets his roots • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:51:35.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
