Creating one look to take me from office to cocktails, beach to dance floor, and gym to designer coffee emporium is all within my skillset. However, I recently found myself unable to curate an all-encompassing look appropriate for two very different occasions. All packed up to go to a June wedding, we got the call. There was a death in the family. We ordered flowers and made calls, wondering if it was appropriate to attend both in the same day. Prioritising the funeral, we hit the motorway late and drove like the clappers, assured by the best man that we would make dinner and speeches. Of course, transitioning from mourning to celebrating was a challenge in itself. But changing my appearance presented its own set of problems. The moving car would have to serve as my dressing room What of my glum jersey dress, makeup-less face, milk-bottle legs and flat hair? No problems for my other half, who changed his tie and spritzed on a little Lacoste Red. I did not even have two minutes to take advantage of a grim motorway service station toilet. The moving car would have to serve as my dressing room. The credit-card sized visor mirror functioned remarkably well as I did makeup first, balancing powders, brushes and compacts in the lap of my funeral dress (which would end up looking like a beige-on-black Jackson Pollock painting). As one would have thought, Friday rush-hour is not the ideal time to be stripping down to undergarments in the front passenger seat of a Renault. But you never know. Maybe my Houdini-style act of wriggling into my vintage frock, while adding an extra layer of Spanx in a confined space brightened the day of all those passing motorway commuters and truck drivers. The application of fake tan to one’s body in transit is not for the faint of heart All plans to rock “big hair” went out the window. A little back-combing and a ballerina’s bun was all I could manage without proper tools. This did, however, give me the opportunity to punish the driver for the ease of his wardrobe transition, by filling the car with extreme-hold hairspray. As we left the motorway for winding country roads, it dawned on me that I had left the messiest jobs for the bumpiest part of the ride. Predictably, the application of fake tan to one’s body in transit is not for the faint of heart. Nor is the painting of fingernails and toenails in pothole territory. Pulling up to the hotel in the nick of time, I stuffed a lipstick and my phone in a gold clutch, pulled on a tiered pearl necklace and gold studs, and slipped my feet into a pair of mule sandals. Job done. Forget four weddings and funeral, one wedding and one funeral was difficult enough! When the unpredictable happens, the AA is there to help.
