I remember the moment the instructor said, “Well done, you’ve passed.” “You are joking, I take it,” I replied, thinking that the whole, white-knuckle ride had obviously sent the man doolally. “I don’t joke,” he continued rather dolefully. “You've passed.” It was the first time I realised that the adult world wasn’t quite as bulletproof as I first thought. Any system that allowed me to drive a machine, at speed, on busy roads, was clearly flawed. How had I passed? Why had I passed? If I was nervous when learning, then I was decidedly terrified now I was let loose . The nutters! The rite of passage that involved taking out your folks’ car for the first time was tempting me... Once I’d calmed down, back at home, I decided that passing your driving test could actually be quite a positive thing. After all, the learning part of driving was finally over, and there was surely some fun to be had from being mobile on the Queen’s highways. The Beach Boys wouldn’t shut up with their songs about driving cars. I’ve always been a fan of Eighties’ teen films and so the rite of passage that involved taking out your folks’ car for the first time was tempting me from the off. Now, I knew from these movies that this could backfire because adolescents played by Matthew Broderick and Tom Cruise were constantly trashing Ferraris and Porsches in these films. So I decided that my first journey wasn’t to be a thrill ride resulting in a high-speed game of cat and mouse with angry locals. Go slow: There's no shame in driving carefully... or is there? Photo: Corbis No. I was going to be careful. Plus, my mum didn’t have a Ferrari for me to trash. Instead, my steed was a white paper-merchant’s van that she borrowed from work. It was 1987, and although my mixtape was full of Metallica and Guns N’ Roses, my nervy entrance into motorhood was less The Fast and the Furious and more Driving Miss Daisy, as I pootled from Norwich city centre to my Nan’s house a whopping eight miles away. The thing that stood out for me was this feeling that I was now on a parity with adults. As I pulled up at the traffic lights and looked to my left, I could see an adult human being, not taking any real notice of me. To them I was a just another bloke driving a car. Yet in my head, it was like sneaking into the pub as a child and being aware that I was no longer on the see-saw eating my cheese and onion. I was in their world, and on equal terms. Nan started making hand gestures and I wound down the window to head her off at the pass I arrived at Nan’s and made out it was no big deal, although the entire time I was there, I kept staring out the window at my wheels. I was glad I made the first foray on my own and not with a gang of screaming lads and I’m glad it was to visit Nanny, although she came out of the house to watch me leave her driveway, something that annoyed my mum for years; as if she didn’t trust us to leave without knocking down her garden wall. Then Nan started making hand gestures and I wound down the window to head her off at the pass. “It's OK Nan, I’ve got this covered. Just relax!” She wasn’t having any of it. “But you haven’t got your lights on!” I knew that of course. Silly woman. I just hadn’t got round to it yet.
