The 116-room hotel at 524 S. St. Mary's St., which accounted for $17.5 million of the transaction, is part of Condor Hospitality Trust Inc.'s attempt to focus on newer, higher-quality assets as it rebuilds its portfolio. The other two properties included in the deal were the 142-room Hotel Indigo Atlanta Airport in College Park, Georgia, and the 120-room Courtyard Jacksonville Flagler Center in Jacksonville, Florida. Enlarge The SpringHill Suites Downtown has been bought for $17.5 million by Condor Hospitality… more Since bringing on new CEO Bill Blackham this year, Condor (Nasdaq: CDOR) — formerly known as Supertel Hospitality Inc. — has been quick to sell off the legacy hotels in its portfolio in order to recycle the capital toward what Blackham called \"premium assets.\" \"The acquisition of these three relatively new, high-quality hotels provides a vision of the company's portfolio of the future and aligns perfectly with the new investment strategy underway,\" Blackham said in a news release. \"These hotels are located in vibrant markets with solid growth potential and enjoy the benefit of premier brands.\" And the Marriott-branded hotel in downtown San Antonio is exactly that. Built in 1997 and renovated last year, the four-story property spans more than an acre of prime urban real estate, especially considering it's just one block west of Hemisfair's recently opened Yanaguana Garden park. The seller, Peachtree Hotel Group, which bought the hotel in July 2010, will stay on to manage all three hotels in the portfolio. It's no secret that downtown San Antonio isn't known for having premium assets. Condor's investment in the area is one more step toward proving the city's downtown is a viable market. Meanwhile, the acquisition is the first — and only — Texas asset in the REIT's portfolio. The market still has some considerable catching up to do with Texas' other three major metro areas, but having Condor use the downtown San Antonio hotel to leverage its shift toward a high-quality, premium portfolio is undoubtedly a step in the right direction.
