The postings with the most likes will win the tickets. \nProflight Zambia launched its inaugural flight to Durban, South Africa, from Lusaka on September 22 directly linking the two cities, flying three times a week to Durban using its 50-seater CRJ-100 aircraft. \n“The response has been overwhelming. It seems we have really caught everyone’s imagination with our latest promotion,” said Captain Phillip Lemba, Director of Governance Government and Industry Affairs at Proflight Zambia. “By Monday morning, more than 50 people had already posted pictures, showing the extent of enthusiasm for this new service.” \nDurban is one of South Africa’s most popular cities, and from last month, Zambia residents can fly direct from Lusaka thanks to the new three-times-a-week service by Proflight Zambia that also links into the airline’s network of domestic destination across Zambia. \nDurban has become one of South Africa’s most-visited places over the past few years both as a tourist center and an important business hub, being home to the ninth largest harbor in the world and the busiest cargo port and container terminal in Southern Africa. \nTourist attractions include Durban’s beaches, the world class uShaka Marine World, and top-notch shopping. The city regularly hosts world-class musical events, cultural functions and sporting activities, and was recently selected to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games. A host of trade and consumer exhibitions are also lined up for coming months. \nDurban is also home to a number of world-renowned schools that attract pupils from Zambia as well as elsewhere across Africa. \nFlight P0024 leaves Lusaka at 1100 hours on Thursdays Fridays (from October 30) and Saturdays, arriving in Durban at 1330 hours. The returning P0025 flight leaves Durban at 1410 hours on Thursdays and Fridays (from October 30) and arrives in Lusaka at 1640 hours.
