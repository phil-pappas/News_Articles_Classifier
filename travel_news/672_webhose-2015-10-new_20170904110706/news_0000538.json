I had posted here a long time back ( Tawang in December's last week (25th - 30th) ) so I have some very basic idea on ILP. However, below are some of my questions: 1. ON DAY #2: Where we can get the bus? 2. ON DAY #3: Any other places that we can visit while in the road towards Dirang? And Any other suggestions on the hotel apart from what is mentioned? 3. ON DAY #4: Any suggestions on hotels in Tawang apart from Hotel Sela? 4. Any suggestions on good car rentals (I believe local driver will be good isn't it?) FYI: Some of the driver numbers that I've collected from different forums: Mr Dipak Kataki: +91-9864182449 / +91-9435080318 / +91-9435381326 Meeraj Ahmed: 09435080318 / 09401263717 Nurul Islam: 09954126877 S Serv Travels - D.K. Nath: 09854003817 So friends, can you help me on the above questions and on improving the itinerary? Please suggest your views.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:28:47.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
