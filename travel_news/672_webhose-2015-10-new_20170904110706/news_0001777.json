Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $0.82 , up from $0.81 in the third quarter of 2014. North America contract sales, excluding residential sales, were $142.8 million . Company adjusted development margin was 21.2 percent and North America adjusted development margin was 23.1 percent. Resort management and other services revenues net of expenses totaled $26.4 million , up $3.3 million from the third quarter of 2014. Rental revenues net of expenses totaled $13.5 million , up $2.5 million from the third quarter of 2014. During the third quarter of 2015, the company repurchased $39.9 million of its common stock, bringing total 2015 repurchases through the end of the third quarter to $106.1 million . In August 2015 , the company completed a securitization of $264 million of vacation ownership notes receivable at a blended borrowing rate of 2.56 percent, generating gross proceeds of $255 million . Third quarter 2015 net income was $21.6 million , or $0.67 diluted EPS, compared to net income of $25.6 million , or $0.75 diluted EPS, in the third quarter of 2014. Company development margin was 17.8 percent and North America development margin was 20.0 percent in the third quarter of 2015.\nNon-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted development margin are reconciled and adjustments are shown and described in further detail on pages A-1 through A-19 of the Financial Schedules that follow.\n\"On an overall basis, we are pleased with our third quarter financial results, delivering nearly $52 million of Adjusted EBITDA,\" said Stephen P. Weisz , president and chief executive officer. \"While our development business in the quarter was negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar and unfavorable revenue reportability, our rentals, resort management and financing businesses remained strong. Excluding the impact of revenue reportability in the quarter, Adjusted EBITDA would have been nearly $59 million . Even with the headwinds from the stronger U.S dollar, we expect full year Adjusted EBITDA to be at the high end of our guidance of $222 million to $232 million , demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model.\"\nThird Quarter 2015 Results\nCompany Results\nTotal company contract sales, excluding residential sales, were $159.8 million , $7.5 million lower than the third quarter of last year. The decrease was driven by $5.4 million of lower contract sales in the company's North America segment, $1.2 million of lower contract sales in the company's Europe segment and $0.9 million of lower contract sales in the company's Asia Pacific segment.\nAdjusted development margin was $31.3 million , a $4.8 million decrease from the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted development margin percentage was 21.2 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 22.6 percent in the third quarter of 2014. Development margin was $24.4 million , a $9.0 million decrease from the third quarter of 2014. Development margin percentage was 17.8 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 21.5 percent in the third quarter of 2014.\nRental revenues totaled $76.0 million , a $10.4 million increase from the third quarter of 2014, reflecting a 6 percent increase in transient keys rented, $4.3 million from revenue associated with operating hotels in San Diego and Surfers Paradise, Australia prior to conversion to timeshare, and higher plus points revenue. Rental revenues, net of expenses, were $13.5 million , a $2.5 million increase from the third quarter of 2014.\nResort management and other services revenues totaled $73.8 million , a $2.8 million increase from the third quarter of 2014. Resort management and other services revenues, net of expenses, were $26.4 million , a $3.3 million , or 14 percent, increase over the third quarter of 2014.\nFinancing revenues totaled $28.3 million , a $1.3 million decrease from the third quarter of 2014. Financing revenues, net of expenses and consumer financing interest expense, were $17.5 million , a $1.0 million decrease from the third quarter of 2014.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $51.7 million in the third quarter of 2015, a $2.3 million , or 4.3 percent, decrease from $54.0 million in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of unfavorable revenue reportability in both years, Adjusted EBITDA would have been $58.6 million in the third quarter of 2015, a $1.8 million , or 3.2 percent, increase from $56.8 million in the third quarter of 2014.\nSegment Results\nNorth America\nNorth America contract sales, excluding residential sales, were $142.8 million in the third quarter of 2015, a decrease of $5.4 million , or 3.6 percent, from the prior year period, driven by a stronger U.S. dollar that negatively impacted sales to Latin American and Japanese customers at certain sales locations by nearly $7 million year-over-year.\nVPG decreased 1.4 percent to $3,428 in the third quarter of 2015 from $3,477 in the third quarter of 2014, driven by fewer points purchased per contract, offset partially by higher pricing and improved closing efficiency. Tours decreased 1.3 percent year-over-year.\nThird quarter 2015 North America segment financial results were $85.3 million , a decrease of $0.7 million from the third quarter of 2014. The decrease was driven primarily by $9.2 million of lower development margin and $1.1 million of lower financing revenues, offset partially by $3.3 million of higher resort management and other services revenues net of expenses, $3.1 million of higher rental revenues net of expenses, and $3.0 million related to a litigation settlement in the prior year period.\nAdjusted development margin was $30.6 million , a $5.6 million decrease from the prior year quarter. Adjusted development margin percentage was 23.1 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 25.5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. Development margin was $24.5 million , a $9.2 million decrease from the third quarter of 2014. Development margin percentage was 20.0 percent in the third quarter of 2015 compared to 24.4 percent in the prior year quarter.\nAsia Pacific\nTotal contract sales in the segment were $6.9 million , a decrease of $0.9 million in the third quarter of 2015. Segment financial results were a loss of $4.1 million , a $5.1 million decrease from the third quarter of 2014, reflecting $4.2 million of transaction costs associated with the purchase of an operating Marriott hotel in Surfers Paradise, Australia. The company plans to convert a portion of this hotel into vacation ownership interests for future use and to sell the remaining downsized hotel to a third party.\nEurope\nThird quarter 2015 contract sales were $10.1 million , a decrease of $1.2 million from the third quarter of 2014. Segment financial results were $6.2 million , a $0.5 million decrease from the third quarter of 2014 due to lower development margin from lower contract sales and lower rental revenues net of expenses.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, the company purchased 479,612 shares of its common stock for a total of nearly $40 million under its share repurchase program. In total for 2015, through the end of the third quarter, the company repurchased approximately $106.1 million of its common stock.\nOn October 12, 2015 , the Board of Directors authorized the company to repurchase up to 2.0 million additional shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program. Combined with the shares not yet purchased under its previous authorization, the company is authorized to purchase up to 3.6 million shares.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nOn September 11, 2015 , cash and cash equivalents totaled $321.7 million . Since the beginning of the year, real estate inventory balances declined $52.3 million to $716.0 million , including $351.9 million of finished goods and $364.1 million of land and infrastructure. The company had $780.2 million in gross debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2015, an increase of $68.8 million from year-end 2014, consisting primarily of $776.6 million in gross non-recourse securitized notes. In addition, $40.0 million of gross mandatorily redeemable preferred stock of a subsidiary of the company was outstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2015.\nIn August 2015 , the company completed a securitization of $264 million of vacation ownership notes receivable at a blended borrowing rate of 2.56 percent and an advance rate of 96.5 percent. Approximately $211 million of the vacation ownership notes receivable were purchased on August 13, 2015 by the MVW Owner Trust 2015-1 (the \"2015-1 Trust\"), and all or a portion of the remaining vacation ownership notes receivable may be purchased by the 2015-1 Trust prior to December 31, 2015 . This transaction generated approximately $255 million of gross cash proceeds, of which $51 million will be held in restricted cash until the remaining notes are purchased during the fourth quarter. Approximately $6 million was used to pay transaction expenses and fund required reserves and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes.\nAs of September 11, 2015 , the company had approximately $197 million in available capacity under its revolving credit facility after taking into account outstanding letters of credit.\nOutlook\nThe company is reaffirming the following guidance for the full year 2015:\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$222 million to $232 million\nAdjusted net income\n$108 million to $114 million\nAdjusted company development margin\n21 percent to 22 percent\nAdjusted free cash flow\n$175 million to $200 million\nThe company is providing the following updated guidance for the full year 2015:\nCurrent Guidance\nPrevious Guidance\nCompany contract sales growth (excluding residential)\n0 percent to 2 percent\n5 percent to 8 percent\nAdjusted fully diluted earnings per share\n$3.33 to $3.52\n$3.29 to $3.48\nPages A-1 through A-19 of the Financial Schedules reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures set forth above to the following full year 2015 expected GAAP results: net income of $112 million to $119 million ; fully diluted EPS of $3.46 to $3.68 ; company development margin of 21.1 percent to 22.1 percent; and net cash provided by operating activities of $165 million to $185 million .\nThird Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call\nThe company will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EST today to discuss these results and the updated guidance for full year 2015.

We discuss our reasons for reporting these non-GAAP financial measures below, and the financial schedules reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial measure that we report (identified by a double asterisk (\"**\") on the preceding pages). Although we evaluate and present these non-GAAP financial measures for the reasons described below, please be aware that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues, net income, earnings per share or any other comparable operating measure prescribed by GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated and / or presented differently than measures with the same or similar names that are reported by other companies, and as a result, the non-GAAP financial measures we report may not be comparable to those reported by others.\nAdjusted Net Income. We evaluate non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted Development Margin, that exclude certain items and gains (losses) and other income (expense) in the 12 weeks and 36 weeks ended September 11, 2015 and September 12, 2014 because these non-GAAP financial measures allow for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of certain items and gains (losses) and other income (expense). These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our comparison of results from our on-going core operations before certain items and gains (losses) and other income (expense) with results from other vacation ownership companies.\nCertain items - 12 weeks and 36 weeks ended September 11, 2015. In our Statement of Income for the 12 weeks ended September 11, 2015, we recorded $7.4 million of net pre-tax items, which included a $4.2 million adjustment for transaction costs in our Asia Pacific segment and a $1.0 million adjustment for transaction costs in our Corporate and Other segment, both recorded under the \"Other\" caption, a $1.8 million adjustment for refurbishment costs at a project in our North America segment, and $0.4 million of organizational and separation related costs recorded under the \"Organizational and separation related\" caption. In our Statement of Income for the 36 weeks ended September 11, 2015, we recorded $2.8 million of net pre-tax items, which included a $28.4 million adjustment to exclude the bulk sale of 18 units in our Asia Pacific segment recorded under the \"Sale of vacation ownership products\" caption, with corresponding adjustments of $21.6 million and $0.9 million to the \"Cost of vacation ownership products\" and Marketing and sales\" captions, respectively, a $5.4 million adjustment for transaction costs in our Asia Pacific segment and a $1.0 million adjustment for transaction costs in our Corporate and Other segment, both recorded under the \"Other\" caption, a $1.8 million adjustment for refurbishment costs at a project in our North America segment, $0.7 million of organizational and separation related costs recorded under the \"Organizational and separation related\" caption and less than $0.1 million of net litigation related matters recorded under the \"Litigation settlement\" caption, and a $0.3 million reversal of an accrual associated with a 2014 golf course disposition recorded under the \"Litigation settlement\" caption because actual costs were lower than expected.\nCertain items - 12 weeks and 36 weeks ended September 12, 2014. In our Statement of Income for the 12 weeks ended September 12, 2014, we recorded $3.6 million of net pre-tax items, which included a $3.0 million accrual for a litigation settlement in our North America segment and a $0.3 million accrual for a litigation settlement in our Corporate and Other segment, both recorded under the \"Litigation settlement\" caption, $0.3 million of organizational and separation related costs recorded under the \"Organizational and separation related\" caption, and less than a $0.1 million impairment charge associated with a project in our North America segment recorded under the \"Impairment\" caption. In our Statement of Income for the 36 weeks ended September 12, 2014, we recorded $1.1 million of net pre-tax income, which included $7.6 million of income associated with the settlement of a dispute with a former service provider in our North America segment recorded under the \"Litigation settlement\" caption and a $0.2 million reversal of a severance accrual in our Europe segment recorded under the \"Resort management and other services\" caption because actual costs were lower than expected, partially offset by a $3.0 million accrual for a litigation settlement in our North America segment and a $0.3 million accrual for a litigation settlement in our Corporate and other segment, both recorded under the \"Litigation settlement\" caption, $2.3 million of organizational and separation related costs recorded under the \"Organizational and separation related\" caption, a $0.9 million impairment charge associated with a project in our North America segment recorded under the \"Impairment\" caption and $0.3 million of severance charges in our Europe segment recorded under the \"Marketing and sales\" caption.\nA-18\nMARRIOTT VACATIONS WORLDWIDE CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nGains (losses) and other income (expense) - 12 weeks and 36 weeks ended September 11, 2015. In our Statement of Income for the 12 weeks ended September 11, 2015, we recorded net losses and other expense of less than $0.1 million on the \"(Losses) gains and other (expense) income\" caption. In our Statement of Income for the 36 weeks ended September 11, 2015, we recorded $9.5 million of net gains associated with the sale of undeveloped land and the sale of a golf course and adjacent undeveloped land in our North America segment under the \"Gains and other income\" caption.\nGains (losses) and other income (expense) - 12 weeks and 36 weeks ended September 12, 2014. In our Statement of Income for the 12 weeks ended September 12, 2014, we recorded a $0.2 million gain associated with the sale of a golf course and adjacent undeveloped land in our North America segment under the \"(Losses) gains and other (expense) income\" caption. In our Statement of Income for the 36 weeks ended September 12, 2014, we recorded $1.8 million of net gains associated with the sale of a golf course and adjacent undeveloped land, the sale of an undeveloped parcel of land, and the disposition of a project, all of which occurred in our North America segment and were recorded under the \"Gains and other income\" caption.\nAdjusted Development Margin (Adjusted Sale of Vacation Ownership Products Net of Expenses). We evaluate Adjusted Development Margin (Adjusted Sale of Vacation Ownership Products Net of Expenses) as an indicator of operating performance. Adjusted Development Margin adjusts Sale of vacation ownership products revenues for the impact of revenue reportability, includes corresponding adjustments to Cost of vacation ownership products expense and Marketing and sales expense associated with the change in revenues from the Sale of vacation ownership products, and includes adjustments for certain items as itemized in the discussion of Adjusted Net Income above. We evaluate Adjusted Development Margin because it allows for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of revenue reportability and certain items to our Development Margin.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"). EBITDA is defined as earnings, or net income, before interest expense (excluding consumer financing interest expense), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. For purposes of our EBITDA calculation (which previously adjusted for consumer financing interest expense), we do not adjust for consumer financing interest expense because the associated debt is secured by vacation ownership notes receivable that have been sold to bankruptcy remote special purpose entities and is generally non-recourse to us. Further, we consider consumer financing interest expense to be an operating expense of our business.\nWe consider EBITDA to be an indicator of operating performance, and we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures and expand our business. We also use it, as do analysts, lenders, investors and others, because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. The tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. EBITDA also excludes depreciation and amortization because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. These differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We also evaluate Adjusted EBITDA, which reflects additional adjustments for certain items and gains (losses) and other income (expense), as itemized in the discussion of Adjusted Net Income above. We evaluate Adjusted EBITDA as an indicator of operating performance because it allows for period-over-period comparisons of our on-going core operations before the impact of certain items and gains (losses) and other income (expense). Together, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate our comparison of results from our on-going core operations before the impact of certain items and gains (losses) and other income (expense) with results from other vacation ownership companies.\nA-19\nMARRIOTT VACATIONS WORLDWIDE CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nFree Cash Flow. We also evaluate Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash provided by operating activities after capital expenditures for property and equipment, changes in restricted cash, and the borrowing and repayment activity related to our securitizations. We consider Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparison of our results with our competitors' results.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow. We also evaluate Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which reflects additional adjustments for organizational and separation related, litigation, and other cash items, as referred to in the discussion of Adjusted Net Income above. We evaluate Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash provided by operating activities after capital expenditures for property and equipment, changes in restricted cash, and the borrowing and repayment activity related to our securitizations, excluding the impact of organizational and separation related, litigation, and other cash charges. We consider Adjusted Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Adjusted Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparison of our results with our competitors' results.\nNormalized Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We also evaluate Normalized Adjusted Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash provided by operating activities after capital expenditures for property and equipment, changes in restricted cash, the borrowing and repayment activity related to our securitizations, and adjustments to remove the impact of cash flow items not expected to occur on a regular basis. Adjustments eliminate the impact of excess cash taxes, payments for Marriott Rewards Points issued prior to the Spin-off, payments for organizational and separation related efforts, litigation cash settlements and other working capital changes. We consider Normalized Adjusted Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including acquisitions and strengthening the balance sheet. Analysis of Normalized Adjusted Free Cash Flow also facilitates management's comparison of our results with our competitors' results.\nA-20\nMARRIOTT VACATIONS WORLDWIDE CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\n(unaudited)\nSeptember 11, 2015\nJanuary 2, 2015\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 321,690\n$ 346,515\nRestricted cash (including $93,803 and $34,986 from VIEs, respectively)\n121,752\n109,907\nAccounts and contracts receivable, net (including $4,211 and $4,992 from VIEs, respectively)\n128,321\n109,700\nVacation ownership notes receivable, net (including $704,349 and $750,680 from VIEs, respectively)\n887,456\n917,228\nInventory\n721,664\n772,784\nProperty and equipment\n247,317\n147,379\nOther\n98,827\n127,066\nTotal Assets\n$ 2,527,027\n$ 2,530,579\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nAccounts payable\n$ 77,516\n$ 114,079\nAdvance deposits\n66,436\n60,192\nAccrued liabilities (including $1,635 and $1,088 from VIEs, respectively)\n150,928\n165,969\nDeferred revenue\n44,499\n38,818\nPayroll and benefits liability\n87,871\n93,073\nLiability for Marriott Rewards customer loyalty program\n73,904\n89,285\nDeferred compensation liability\n48,468\n41,677\nMandatorily redeemable preferred stock of consolidated subsidiary, net\n38,935\n38,816\nDebt, net (including $776,648 and $708,031 from VIEs, respectively)\n769,716\n703,013\nOther\n38,239\n27,071\nDeferred taxes\n94,544\n78,883\nTotal Liabilities\n1,491,056\n1,450,876\nPreferred stock - $.01 par value;
