The award is presented annually to the ALHI Member hotel or resort that best displays exemplary leadership and commitment to performance in the preceding year, while epitomizing exceptional property-level teamwork and cohesion with ALHI’s GSO team in serving the meetings industry. The award was presented at ALHI’s prestigious Industry Advisory Council (IAC) Conference, recently held at the new Trump National Doral Miami, which brought together more than 275 senior leaders from many of ALHI’s Accounts, with General Managers and Senior Marketing Executives of ALHI’s worldwide Membership portfolio.\n \nPictured are: ALHI CEO David Gabri (right) and M.

Pictured receiving the coveted recognition are (from center left): Seaport Hotel & World Trade Center’s Vice President of Sales/Assistant General Manager Marianna Accomando and Vice President & General Manager Jim Carmody.\n \nALHI’s Membership portfolio features more than 170 Four- and Five-Diamond quality hotels and resorts in North America that specifically focus on luxury meetings, incentive travel, conventions and expositions. ALHI also provides GSO “Alliance” services in North America for more than 70 luxury hotels and resorts in Europe, the Middle East and Asia; a variety of 23 luxury-level cruise ships (Norwegian Cruise Line, Regent Seven Seas Cruises and Oceania Cruises) appropriate for M&I programs; and 55 Destination Management Companies (DMCs) in over 100 destinations worldwide with Global DMC Partners.\n \n“Seaport Hotel & World Trade Center in Boston is truly deserving of this special recognition and award,” said Gabri. “It is an exceptional and dynamic hotel, with an extraordinary leadership team and staff, led by Jim and Marianna. They work so well with our valued clients and our ALHI Global Sales team in serving the meetings marketplace. We are proud to recognize Seaport Hotel & World Trade Center with this distinguished honor.”\n \nLocated on Boston Harbor in the vibrant Seaport District, the elegant Seaport Hotel & World Trade Center offers 428 newly renovated guest rooms and suites that offer dazzling city and harbor views, and over 180,000 square feet of meeting space, which is more flexible meeting and event space than any other Boston hotel. Situated within walking distance of dozens of dining and entertainment venues, the AAA Four-Diamond hotel also is just a quick water taxi, cab or MBTA ride from Logan Airport and South Station, and is just minutes from the city’s finest shops, museums and cultural attractions.\n \nSource:- Associated Luxury Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:27:57.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
