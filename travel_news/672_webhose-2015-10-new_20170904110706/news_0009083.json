The 930-passenger ship was praised for its \"more inclusive price structure from its river offerings\" as well as the complimentary Wi-Fi, alcoholic beverages at lunch and dinner and a free shore excursion in every port.\nAzamara Club Cruises scored highly with the judges as well, winning the Best Shore Excursions award for the second year in succession, while Carnival Cruise Line snagged the Best Value-for-Money award, commended for its \"range of affordable fares and well-rounded offerings onboard.\"\nThere was a big win for Un-Cruise in the Best for Adventure category.\nThe line offers hiking, kayaking and snorkeling experiences across Alaska, Hawaii, the Pacific Northwest, Baja Mexico and the enchanting Galapagos.\nNext year it's heading to Costa Rica, too.\nUn-Cruise adventures was praised for its alternative style and adventure programs. \"Our editors live and breathe cruising, sailing year-round and covering every aspect of the industry -- from new ships and programs to updated amenities and features,\" said Carolyn Spencer Brown, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic.\n\"With so many wonderful cruise options available, it's never an easy list to narrow down, but these awards truly represent the lines that our experts have recognized as the best of the best.\n\"This year we also highlight the top river cruise lines, reflecting the growth of this sector -- in terms of both interest and options.\"\nIn the river category, Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection stole the show with editors singling out the line's \"lavish onboard offerings and amenities, new itineraries and innovative excursion offerings.\"\nUniworld's S.S. Maria Theresa wowed the editors with it's style and sophistication. The line won the Best River Cruise Line, Best New River Ship -- for the new S.S.
