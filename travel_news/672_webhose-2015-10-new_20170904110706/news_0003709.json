Keep these in mind. \nWhether you’re looking for an upscale Kensington hotel or a simple yet modern Stratford inn, access to public and private transport will determine how smoothly you can move around in London. When it comes to accessibility, these three hotels in different parts of the city offer an excellent choice for holiday or business accommodation. \nThe Regency Hotel \nLocated at 100 Queen’s Gate, Kensington and Chelsea, this lovely 4-star hotel is smack-dab in the middle of London’s posh Kensington district. From the Victorian architecture to the memory foam mattresses for maximum comfort, this upmarket Kensington hotel is just the ticket if you’re looking for location, style and comfort. You can explore the nearby department stores and royal palaces located virtually next door to The Regency, and it also takes you less than 10 minutes by bus to the shopping and theatres of the West End. If you need to travel further, you'll have access to two Tube stations just five minutes away from this lovely Kensington hotel. If you want easy access to the best that London can offer, a stay at the Regency wraps both luxury and accessibility in one appealing package. \nThe Hide London \nLocated at 230 Hendon Way, this 4-star luxury boutique hotel is the perfect accommodation if you'd prefer to be based a little away from the busier parts of London without completely isolating yourself from it. The hotel has a stylish aesthetic and cosy ambience, and the off-the-beaten-track location of The Hide makes it a quieter and more relaxing experience than staying right in the central district. However, it will take you less than two minutes to walk to the nearby Hendon Tube Station on Queen’s Road, which then connects you to virtually every part of London. This is perfect alternative for those not keen on crowds. \nThe White Hart Hotel \nLocated at 1 High Street, Hampton Wick, Kingston upon Thames, this hotel boasts the aesthetic of an old Tudor-style pub merged in to a modern establishment with all the comforts and amenities you would expect. Its striking façade, with its iconic red bricks and timber frames, recalls the architecture of times gone by, and the well-appointed rooms each run to a theme. The White Hart Hotel is a cosy and quirky alternative to the homogenous appearance of some other, more modern hotels. As well as fabulous accommodation and hospitality, the pub serves a wide range of drinks inside at tables or the well-polished wooden counter, and you can even venture out to the garden if weather permits. It only takes around five minutes to get to the nearby Hampton Wick Station on High St, Hampton Wick will services all points around central London. The hotel (which is located within easy access of a major motorway) even has a free parking policy, which is excellent if you’re in London with your own vehicle. \nKeep these three excellent establishments in mind, and you can find the perfect accommodation to keep you connected to all parts of London – whether your personal preference is a quaint hotel in Hampton Wick or a posh Kensington hotel with all the luxuries on hand.
