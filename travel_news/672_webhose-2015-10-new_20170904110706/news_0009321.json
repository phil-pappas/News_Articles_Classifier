Gordon Kelly reports on two more issues. This first is going to put a real squeeze on 16 GB handsets, and that's the issues over 'app slicing', a method of reducing the size of installed applications. With so many issues cropping up, Apple has simply turned it off and will revisit it in a later update.\nSo losing App Slicing at a time when the addition of 4K video, 12MP cameras and Live Photos has effectively made the base level 16GB iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus borderline pointless, is far from ideal.But there’s good news: Apple states App Slicing will return and “be reenabled with a future software update.” No date has been put on when this will be or which future iOS 9 version will feature it (the new iOS 9.0.1 release left App Slicing on the cutting room floor), but no further user involvement will be required other than installing the update when it comes along. And the fun doesn't stop there. Users who have upgraded to iOS 9 from iOS 8 have found that third-party applications which had cellular access switched off in the settings before the upgrade now have no access to cellular data at all with these apps, even if the setting is switched back to allow access . To be clear: this problem surfaces when iOS 8 users who disabled cellular data for any mobile apps then upgrade to iOS 9. iOS 9 can’t undo anything that was disabled leaving them permanently cut off from cellular data. While Apple believes it has addressed the issue in the latest update to iOS (v9.0.2) the issue is still being reported by some users. The iOS team is not covering itself with glory here.[gallery2012] No Going Back To iOS 8 Apple has stopped digitally signing both iOS 8.4.1 and iOS 9.0. This leaves just iOS 9.0.1 and iOS 9.0.2 as valid downloads from Apple's servers to install on your iOS hardware. Previously, users who upgraded to iOS 9 could have downgraded back to the last version of iOS 8. Not now. Two weeks after iOS 9 was released, it's now the only choice, as Apple Insider highlights . With Apple no longer signing code, users who upgraded to the latest iOS 9 release can no longer revert to older iOS versions. Apple released iOS 8.4.1 in August with fixes for Apple Music and iCloud Music Library, while iOS 9.0 saw its debut two weeks ago. Ten Things To Do With Your New iPhone One week after the release of the iPhone 6S, the handset (along with the iPhone 6S Plus) is in the hands of millions of users. Once you've went through the on-boarding process, set up TouchID, added your favorite apps, what's next? Forbes' Jay McGregor has some ideas , starting with 3D Touch: But before you *dive* in, take a second to understand how it works. The main thing to wrap your excited mind around is the ‘Peek and Pop’ feature, which lets you dip into content without fully opening it. For example, soft pressing on an email will let you ‘peak’ at it, while a hard press will open it fully. Sliding up whilst ‘peeking’ on said email will also present other options and access to shortcuts.

Following its first teardown, it returned to the hardware to test a hypothesis . [Apple] didn’t just run a strip of glue around the existing display like they were caulking a bathtub. Instead, it appears the iPhone’s frame has been subtly reworked to accommodate the new gasket. We noted a slight, but measurable, increase in the width of the lip running along the perimeter of the frame—it’s about 0.3 mm wider than on the iPhone 6, making it just wide enough for that little gasket to land on.One-third of a millimeter may not seem like much, but given how tight the iPhone’s tolerances are nowadays, the change is big enough to see with the naked eye. And it’s almost certainly enough of a change that other components had to be subtly tweaked to match. Make no mistake, Apple gave this careful thought. For consumers, the biggest point of interest is the abundance of gaskets, silicon seals, and moisture protection inside the casing. While there is no IP rating or anything being said publicly, the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus are more resistant to water than any previous iPhone. That's naturally going to reduce repair costs and make for a better user experience... and could lead to a an IP rated 'waterproof' iPhone 7. Neil Hughes reports . Revelations about improved water resistance in the iPhone 6s lineup come on the heels of a recent rumor suggesting Apple plans to utilize an even more comprehensive waterproof design for next year's so-called \"iPhone 7.\" It was said that prototype next-generation iPhones feature design improvements intended to keep out both water and dust, suggesting Apple is toying with a more \"ruggedized\" handset for a 2016 refresh. On the financial side, the assumed bill of materials per device is up $16.50. Like for like sales would see a drop across the board in the end of , as Forbes' Chuck Jones illustrates . Teardown.com’s analysis of Apple’s iPhone 6s 16GB model has it costing $16.50 more than last year’s iPhone 6. With a price of $649 in the US this is a 2.5% or 254 basis points impact to the iPhone’s gross margin. Analysts tend to peg the iPhone’s gross margin around 45% so 2.5% is a hit but it isn’t a major one. Everything else being equal if Apple sells the equivalent 74.5 million iPhones in the December 2015 quarter as it did a year ago its cost of goods would increase by $1.23 billion, lower its total gross margin from 39.9% to 38.2% and decrease its EPS from $3.06 to $2.86. It's worth noting that this bill of materials is the raw cost per device, and does not amortize development or research costs.[caption id=\"attachment_20978\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] iPhone 6S and 6S Plus Taptic Engine and 3D Touch diagram (image: Apple PR)[/caption] Benchmarking The New iPhone Hardware While Apple draws attention to a handful of major user features, the real changes in the 'S' years is in the low-level hardware. Anandtech's Joshua Ho investigates the new structures, including an SSD controller that mimics the MacBook and offers far faster read times, breaking new records for faster web browsing, and improved 3d GFX results Overall, while there’s still a great deal of work left to do to exhaustively evaluate the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, the initial results are quite positive. I haven’t finished a detailed investigation into the architecture of Twister, but I suspect we’re looking at some pretty significant changes compared to Typhoon, which would be unlike the smaller move from Cyclone to Typhoon. The GPU improvements are enormous, and while we don’t have enough data to determine whether the iPhone 6s retains the same sustained GPU performance that we saw in the iPhone 6, the peak performance figures are impressive to say the least. The SSD-like storage solution is also a major surprise, and likely to be overlooked as its effects are often hard to distinguish without direct comparison. You can work through all the results and comparisons at Anandtech .[caption id=\"attachment_20684\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus (image: Apple.com)[/caption] Apple Dominates The Right Market With The iPhone While Android continues to dominate the smartphone market if you count the number of units sold, Apple dominates in other areas that have a much more pronounced effect on the ecosystem. Apple is approaching a fifty percent share of the premium smartphone market, which brings economic advantages to Cupertino, and the ability to wage economic war against the competition . Apple has perfected a triple play – It squeezes the competition’s profit, it reduces the effectiveness of their marketing, and it limits the money that can be invested in research and development. These effects are only going to become more intense as the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus juggernaut builds up pace over the next few months.As long as Apple continues to build its market share in premium devices, the competition from Android manufacturers will find it harder and more expensive to match the iPhone. OSX El Capitan Released As well as updates in the mobile space, Apple's desktop OS has also been updated. OSX El Capitan (v10.11) has now left the development cycle and is available as a free update via the Mac App Store. It focuses not on new features, but on performance and stability. Benjamin Mayo reports : El Capitan is not the biggest update in Mac history, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t a variety of changes and improvements to enjoy. It’s expected for a maturing platform to have less major additions and it doesn’t really matter when the updates are free.Make sure you backup first in the (frankly unlikely) case something goes wrong, but otherwise you can update any Yosemite Mac right now from the Mac App Store with effectively zero downside. If you're looking for a second opinion, The Verge's Dieter Bohn has reviewed the OS release , and finds that the real change is not in the updated apps or UI changes... it's the philosophy behind OSX: El Capitan takes the sorts of things that experts have been doing with third-party apps and utilities for years on the Mac and builds them right into the OS. Spotlight is becoming more than just a simple file search box. Window management is becoming easier. Notes is more than just a raw text box. Most of it left me nonplussed because all of these things didn't feel new and different to me — I've been finding ways to fix all of those problems for years with third-party apps and add-ons. But with El Capitan, Apple's made the learning curve you usually have to climb to become a \"power user\" (whatever that is) much more gradual.

Apple Maps has evolved, and How To Geek's Chris Stobing has put the latest versions of the mapping and navigation tools in a head-to-head : Going into this article, I thought we were going to have a clear winner with Google Maps sitting comfortably out front. However, it was a pleasant surprise to find that with Apple Maps updated and all the kinks finally worked out, the debate between Google or Apple Maps eventually just comes down to your own personal preference.If you’ve been using Google Maps for a number of years and your account already has all your contacts saved – great, go for Google. If you prefer to use Siri to launch your Maps application or want to be able to see where you’re going without having to unlock the phone, Apple Maps is on the job. [caption id=\"attachment_12660\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] The Apple Store, Zorlu Center, Istanbul (image: Apple.com)[/caption] And Finally... Apple's flagship store in the United Kingdom is getting a facelift. The Regent Street store in London. New windows and doors to let in more light will be the obvious changes, but the store (opened in November 2004) is also getting a substantial internal refit, reports Roger Fingas : ...little is known about Apple's plans for the interior except that the company intends to use neutral colors like white, gray, and oak to produce a \"calm environment.\" The company will, however, likely follow the new template established by its Brussels outle t. Both that location and the future Regent Street renovations were designed by Foster & Partners.Apple has been authorized to run a temporary shop in the basement for up to three years, although renovations will likely take up a fraction of that time. One worker told the Standard that most staff are \"not allowed to see upstairs\" until construction is finished. Apple Loop brings you seven days worth of highlights every weekend here on Forbes.
