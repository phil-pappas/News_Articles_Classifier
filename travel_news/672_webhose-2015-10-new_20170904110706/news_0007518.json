The collection includes three capsules, 'Vee,' 'Jet Set,' and 'Sugar' with tote bags, overnighters, and rolling pieces combining functional features with fun surprises such as the ' Ciao Dirty Laundry ' bag that is included inside the large and small rollers.\n\"Lately, I've been using smaller luggage in my everyday travels. For quickie business trips, weekend getaways, and as a train commuter,\" says Jackie. \"As far as style goes, the black roller and tote no longer feel right to me. I designed this line to make a fun vivid statement while maintaining the quality and functionality that we all need from luggage.\"\nFrench Bull Luggage landed October 25, 2015.
