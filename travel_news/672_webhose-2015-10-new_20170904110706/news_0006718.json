The luncheon marks the early stages of an international campaign to secure her long-term future.\nThe striking backdrop of Cunard's flagship ocean liner Queen Mary 2 will provide an inspirational setting to the luncheon whilst she is docked at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. It is the second such event sponsored by Cunard in support of NMRN during this year, with the earlier function hosted aboard Queen Victoria in April whilst the ship was docked in Los Angeles ( San Pedro ), California .\nAll proceeds from the event will go towards the conservation of HMS Victory, which boasts a huge following in America. The ship, which legendarily led the British Fleet to victory against the French in 1805, is most famously associated with Admiral Lord Nelson, who was mortally wounded during the Battle of Trafalgar and is now possibly one of the Greatest Britons.\nDavid W. Fleming , Founding President of the AFNMRN, said: \"We are thrilled to welcome Her Royal Highness as guest of honor. There is a very special relationship and shared respect between our two navies, past and present. The awesome sea power of the UK's greatest flagship, HMS Victory, and the tactical genius of Admiral Lord Nelson capture the hearts and minds of many Americans.\"\nLuncheon Co-Chair Richard Meadows and President of Cunard, North America said: \"This year has been a superb opportunity to showcase and celebrate Cunard's 175th anniversary and the chance to mark this auspicious occasion in the esteemed company of Her Royal Highness and to support probably the world's most famous warship, really is very special. We are delighted to support the AFNMRN in their sterling efforts to help conserve HMS Victory.\"\nAdmiral of the Fleet, The Lord Michael Boyce KG GCB OBE DL, Chair of the HMS Victory Preservation Trust, is a special guest at the luncheon travelling to the USA exclusively for the occasion. Director General of the National Museum of the Royal Navy Professor Dominic Tweddle will also be attending. He said: \"The partnership between the NMRN and its American Friends is very strong and we are extremely fortunate to have Cunard's support in this very special year. This will be a remarkable occasion.\"\nFor more information about Cunard or to book a voyage, contact your Travel Consultant, call Cunard Line at 1-800-728-6273 or visit www.cunard.com .\nFor additional information about the National Museum of the Royal Navy, contact:\nJacquie Shaw, PR Manager, National Museum of the Royal Navy, 02392 728062, jacquie.shaw@nmrn.org.uk\nFor additional information about Cunard, contact:\nJackie Chase , Cunard, 661-753-1035, jchase@cunard.com\nMaria Andriano , MGA Media Group, 212-251-1015, maria@mgamediagroup.com\nEditor's notes\nAMERICAN FRIENDS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL NAVY: The National Museum of the Royal Navy reflects a hardwon history and a modern global reach on, over, and under the sea.
