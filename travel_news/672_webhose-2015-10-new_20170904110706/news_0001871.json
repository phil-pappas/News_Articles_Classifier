You want a place that's easy to get to, on a budget, with something for everyone. \nThen, once you've found Nirvana (Buddhist heaven, not the band) the kids get older. They declare your perfect paradise to be \"boring\". So, what next? \nDuring the transition from toddlers to tweens, my kids replaced Fiji with Los Angeles as their happiest holiday. (Although, frankly, I think they'd be happy going anywhere that has wi-fi…) But every family is different. Some yearn for the country; for others, it's the buzz of a big city. Whatever your passion, there are ground rules: always aim for the dry season; try to book direct flights; and make sure the destination is age-appropriate. \nAs you can see, I've done the hard work for you (!), travelling the world to select the top destinations for families, whatever your age range, interests, and abilities. Any place is good for multi-generational travel, but I've highlighted a handful which are ideal for all ages. And, yes, you can take your toddler to the Jemaa el-Fnaa in Morocco, but a kids' club in the Pacific is infinitely more relaxing. \nThese terrific destinations are alost mostly easy to get to (aside from Paris because, well, it's PARIS), not too expensive, and extremely kid-friendly. So, in no particular order, here goes: \nCOOK ISLANDS \nPerfect for: Toddlers, 5 to 8s and tweens \nWhy we love it: The extraordinary marine life. The kids and I saw a huge orange octopus while snorkelling two metres from the beach at Rarotonga. You can drive around the main island in under an hour. \nMake it happen: Air New Zealand has direct flights to Rarotonga International Airport from Auckland. For more information, see cookislands.travel . \nLOS ANGELES, US Ad Feedback \nPerfect for: Tweens and teens \nWhy we love it: All of a sudden, you're the best parents on earth: Disneyland, Universal Studios, Hollywood, the LA Lakers, Venice Beach, Santa Monica. Need I say more…? \nMake it happen: If you shop around on the net, you can get affordable flights to Los Angeles. Try to stay at one of the Disneyland resorts, for ease of access and early entry. Alternatively, lemeridiendelfina.com is close to the beach and shops at Santa Monica. See visitcalifornia.com \nSleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland Park. Photo: 123rf \nNEW CALEDONIA \nPerfect for: Babies, toddlers, 5 to 8s and tweens \nWhy we love it: A slice of the south of France in the South Pacific. Live with a local family in a homestay, so the kids can learn a little French. You can pick up a bottle of Bordeaux for next to nix (for you, of course, not the kids…). And the cuisine? C'est superb. \nMake it happen: Air Cal flies to Noumea. See nz.aircalin.com . \nPARIS, FRANCE \nPerfect for: Tweens and teens \nWhy we love it: What's not to love? All of the attractions have audio guides or apps for kids; the Metro is easy to navigate, and around every corner is a history lesson. Then there's the cheese. And the bread. And the shopping… \nMake it happen: Stay in The Marais, which is walking distance to Notre Dame and the ice-skating rink at the Hotel de Ville. We use Airbnb to find self-contained apartments. See en.parisinfo.com \nParis is a great place to explore with teens. Photo: 123rf \nFIJI \nPerfect for: Babies, toddlers and 5 to 8s \nWhy we love it: There is no better place for parents with small children: I guarantee it. The Fijian nannies can coax smiles from the crankiest kids. Many resorts offer one nanny per child, so you and your loved one can have some special time together. Ahhh… \nMake it happen: Fiji Airways flies to Nadi and Suva. Our top picks for family accommodation are nanukufiji.com , maloloisland.com or sheratonfiji.com . See fiji.travel ; fijiairways.com \nSAMOA \nPerfect for: Babies, toddlers, 5 to 8s and tweens \nWhy we love it: Samoa remains relatively untouched by tourism, compared with its Pacific neighbours. It's cheap to stay in a fale, an open-sided hut, right on the beach. And the water off Sava'i, the smaller of the two islands, is the colour of Bombay Sapphire. \nMake it happen: Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia fly to Samoa's capital, Apia, from Auckland. At the top end, stay at Le Lagoto Resort & Spa. See samoa.travel ; lelagoto.ws \nA waterfall on the island of Upolu in Samoa. Photo: 123rf \nPHUKET, THAILAND \nPerfect for: Toddlers, 5 to 8s and tweens \nWhy we love it: It's got a bit of a bad rap. But if you stay outside of Patong – which, frankly, is disgusting – you'll find perfectly peaceful, pristine beaches. The food is cheap, delicious and healthy. \nMake it happen: Jetstar.com flies direct to Phuket International Airport. From there, it's a 15-minute drive to the Holiday Inn Resort Phuket Mai Khao Beach This resort is built for kids, with colourful suites filled with books, games and toys. See tourismthailand.org \nQUEENSTOWN, NEW ZEALAND \nPerfect for: Tweens and teens \nWhy we love it: Opt for a staycation instead. Queenstown is the antipodean home of adventure tourism. Teenagers will go nuts over the jet-boating, bungy-jumping, black water rafting, river-surfing and canyon-swinging. The town is compact enough to get around on foot. And, in winter, skiing in the Remarkables is – well – just that. \nMake it happen: There are direct flights to Queenstown on Air New Zealand and Jetstar. Stay at the Heritage Queenstown, with views of the Remarkables. See heritagehotels.co.nz ; queenstownnz.co.nz ; newzealand.com \nA staycation in Queenstown is always an adventure-filled holiday. Photo: 123rf \nHAWAII, US \nPerfect for: 5 to 8s, tweens and teens \nWhy we love it: Waikiki is a feast for the senses: the sight of green turtles swimming in the shallows; the smell of Korean BBQ restaurants; and the sounds of the hula shows. It's perfect for an active family, with surfing, paddleboarding, swimming with dolphins, diving, and hiking. \nMake it happen: The Hilton Hawaiian Village is set across 9 hectares on the widest part of the beachfront, with five pools, waterslides, and a semi-submarine tour. See hiltonhawaiianvillage.com ; gohawaii.com . \nVANUATU \nPerfect for: Tweens and teens \nWhy we love it: Price points and proximity. This archipelago offers everything from resort-style accommodation, to huts in remote villages close to an active volcano. The Vanuatu Tourism Office says resorts are reporting limited damage to buildings after the recent devastating cyclone. Once essential services are restored, resorts will be open for business. \nMake it happen: Air Vanuatu flies direct from Auckland to Port Vila. See vanuatu.travel ; airvanuatu.com \nA diver gets up close to a beautiful soft coral in Vanuatu. Photo: 123rf \nNORFOLK ISLAND, AUSTRALIA \nPerfect for: Multi-generational travel \nWhy we love it: The history, beauty, and idiosyncrasy. Three hours A one-and-a-half-hour flight from New Zealand, this tiny island is home to Australia's oldest convict sites, white-sand beaches, and friendly, albeit quirky, locals. \nMake it happen: Choose from the sprawling homestead or smaller cottages at Tintoela, four-and-a-half-star boutique accommodation overlooking the ocean. There's a fabulous foodie culture on Norfolk, too. See norfolkisland.com.au \nVIETNAM \nPerfect for: Multi-generational travel \nWhy we love it: The chaotic street scenes, flavoursome food, and exquisite tailoring. While initially an assault on the senses, travelling to Vietnam teaches the kids important lessons about the war, religion, and poverty. \nMake it happen: Take an Intrepid tour, to share the experience with other families. See intrepidtravel.com \nVietnam is a popular choice for multi-generational travel. Photo: 123rf \nBEST OF ASIA-PACIFIC \nBALI Steer clear of Kuta to find the pleasures of this paradise: resorts in Nusa Dua, villas in Seminyak, or hotels in Sanur. \nHONG KONG The Octopus Card makes it easy for families to get around this bustling city, which boasts Disneyland, Ocean Park, Peak Tramway, Ladies' Market and delicious dumplings. \nSINGAPORE Universal Studios, 4D Adventureland, the Skyline Luge, MegaZip Adventure Park, and Gogreen Segways are all found on Sentosa Island. Don't miss the solar-powered Supertree Grove, at Gardens by the Bay in the city. \nTHE MALDIVES It's not just for couples. Club Med Kani has 75 over-water suites, fanning across the lagoon like a giant palm tree. \nTHE PHILIPPINES El Nido is one of more than 7000 islands in this archipelago. The resorts are set in a marine reserve, for world-class snorkelling and diving. Another island worth visiting is Bohol, with its famed Chocolate Hills. \nTAHITI Yes, the accommodation is expensive. So, hire a boat through moorings.com.au and buy fresh produce from local supermarkets. This was the best family holiday we've ever had. \nBEST OF THE US \nDISNEY DREAM CRUISE I guess, technically, it's not a destination. But the Disney Dream Cruise is a floating theme park. The highlight is the Aquaduck: the first water coaster at sea. \nFLORIDA This place is custom-built for families, especially the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando. \nSAN FRANCISCO The spooky tour of Alcatraz is a hit with tweens and teens, while a bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito is nothing short of spectacular. \nROCKY MOUNTAINS An RV trip through Colorado, Wyoming and Idaho will take the kids straight back to the Wild West. Yee-har! \nBEST OF EUROPE & THE UK \nLES 3 VALLEES, FRANCE Skiing in the south of France sounds like an expensive family trip. But, when you take into account the extortionate cost of snow resorts in Australia, it's comparable. This is the biggest ski area in the world, with chocolate-box villages at the bottom of the slopes. \nLONDON Most of the museums are free for kids; some have backpacks with activities inside. But Buckingham Palace is difficult to visit with small children, because of the crowds. See visitlondon.com \nROME It's dirty, I know. But the breathtaking sight of the Colosseum, Forum and Vatican makes up for that. Contextravel.com runs family tours, guided by academics who speak in terms children can understand. \nBEST OF AFRICA \nMAURITIUS A jewel in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius has dozens of five-star family-friendly resorts, where the kids clubs' offer language classes and water-skiing lessons. The food is an exotic mix of French, Creole, and Indian. \nMOROCCO The beaches of Essaouira; the jagged peaks of the Atlas; the vast expanse of desert: there's nowhere quite like Morocco for an adventurous family holiday. Base yourselves in Marrakesh near Africa's Disneyland, the UNESCO-listed Jemaa el-Fnaa. \nSOUTH AFRICA Check out &Beyond's Phinda Mountain lodge in KwaZulu Natal. There are four lodges, plus a homestead with private staff. Game drives can be tailored for the shorter attention span of young children. \nINGREDIENTS FOR A DREAM FAMILY DESTINATION \nTHE CHILD CARERS OF FIJI Fijian nannies can calm the wildest beast. It took two minutes for a carer at Jean-Michel Cousteau Fiji Island Resort to turn our six-month-old screamer into a picture-perfect smiler. As a parent of a small child, this is priceless. \nTHE ADVENTURE SPORTS OF HAWAII Regardless of which island you visit, there's an endless array of activities, from swimming with manta rays to climbing a volcano. This is ideal for active families, especially with tweens and teens. \nTHE THEME PARKS OF LOS ANGELES Disneyland, Universal studios, and Legoland, further south, are fun for all ages. I remember saying, \"This is the best day of my life!\" after my debut at Disneyland, despite earlier disparaging it as Merchandiseland. \nTHE FOOD, MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES OF PARIS Let the kids guide you around the Louvre by hiring a Nintendo 3DS, with inbuilt GPS. Download the Eiffel Tower app, to learn how it was built. Stay in the Marais, a foodie and fashion district, walking distance to Notre Dame. This is the kind of holiday that brings history to life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:25:34.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
