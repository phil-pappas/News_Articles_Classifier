No butterfly lives to make the full round trip, and it is unclear how they find the route each year.\nLast year, butterflies that reached the wintering grounds covered 2.79 acres (1.13 hectares). That was a 69 per cent rebound from the previous February's 1.65 acres (0.67 hectare), which was the lowest since record-keeping began in 1993.\nThe migratory route can be 3,400 miles (5,470 kilometres) long.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:32:39.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
