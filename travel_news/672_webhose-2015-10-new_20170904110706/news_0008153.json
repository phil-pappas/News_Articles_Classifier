Then she saw the looks on their faces, and just about crumbled. \"This couple looked very annoyed and I could tell by their body language sitting right next to me that they weren't thrilled about sitting next to Rylee,\" she writes on Facebook . Then, as the plane started to taxi, 4-month-old Rylee began to cry, and Garvison asked if she could move a few rows up where there were two empty seats. Her new seatmate, Nyfesha Miller, asked if she could help calm the baby. \"As soon as she had her, Rylee was looking out the window and stopped crying,\" Garvison continues. \"Rylee ended up sleeping in her lap the whole flight, and Miller \"kept saying it wasn't a problem at all and it was actually a comforting feeling for her.\" Her Facebook post has gone viral, shared more than 87,000 times, and Garvison tells ABC News that Miller is her \"airplane angel\" who \"deserves all the accolades she is getting.\" She adds to Huffington Post that she and Miller have been messaging every day and that they plan to meet up again someday. \"Nyfesha Miller,\" she writes on Facebook, \"you will never understand how happy this act of kindness has made my family.... It brought tears to my eyes while I sat there and watched you and Rylee sleeping next to me.\" (See what this waitress did for grieving parents .) Nyfesha Miller held and slept with her airplane seatmate's baby, who immediately calmed in her arms, the entire flight.
