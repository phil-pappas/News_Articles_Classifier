That is the conclusion of a new study just released by VBW, an association representing the interests of the state's business community. It states that Munich Airport \"is a decisive factor behind the high level of prosperity in Bavaria.\" It currently secures more than 70,000 jobs in the state and accounts for 4.4 billion euros in value creation per year. \nThe study forecasts Germany-wide employment gains of 20,000 jobs through the implementation of the planned third runway, including more than 15,000 in Bavaria. It would also generate added value of more than 1 billion euros annually, of which 862 million euros would remain in Bavaria. \"These figures clearly demonstrate that the airport expansion amounts to an economic stimulus program for all of Bavaria,\" said Dr. Michael Kerkloh, the President and CEO of Munich Airport. Conversely, the authors of the study warn that a failure to expand the airport will put an end to the airport's hub function. The conclusions are also reflected in the views of many business leaders. About 60 renowned Bavarian companies, business associations and international aviation companies have voiced their strong support for the expansion project on the airport's website. \nThe third runway will also open up enormous opportunities for airlines from around the world. Joachim Tietz, the American Airlines head of sales for Central and Eastern Europe, is just one of many supporters of the expansion of the runway system, because, as he says, \"It will support the continuing growth of American Airlines at Munich Airport in the medium to long term, which means offering more flights to destinations all over the world and stationing more aircraft here. That will enable us to create more jobs and help to continue the Munich Airport success story.\" Michael Bentele, the head of European operations for South African Airways, sums it up by saying: â€œOnly a third runway offers South African Airways clear growth prospects.\" \nDr. Michael Kerkloh, the President and CEO of Munich Airport, sees the clear support from the business leaders as \"a strong boost for the expansion project.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:00:25.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
