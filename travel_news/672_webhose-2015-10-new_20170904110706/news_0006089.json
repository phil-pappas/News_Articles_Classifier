Journalists have in recent weeks been allowed to view the files at the attorney general’s office or obtain paid copies.\nConsulta el expediente del Caso #Iguala aquí: http://t.co/ZK5J5FaHSv #Transparencia pic.twitter.com/i5S4hWNQ1u\n— PGR México (@PGR_mx) October 11, 2015\nGomez’s predecessor, Jesús Murillo Karam, concluded that police in the southern city of Iguala attacked the students on September 26, 2014, after they had seized buses for a protest in Mexico City.\nMurillo Karam said the officers took 43 students and handed them over to the Guerreros Unidos drug gang, which confused them with rivals, killed them and incinerated their bodies at a garbage dump.\nBut parents of the students have never accepted the official version, and international human rights groups said Murillo Karam had rushed to declare the 43 young men dead.\nLast month, independent experts from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights tore apart the official investigation, saying there was no scientific evidence that the 43 students were burned to ashes at the landfill.\nThe commission urged the government to open a new line of investigation into the possibility that the students were attacked because they inadvertently hijacked a bus loaded with heroin.\nRead the investigation (in Spanish) here .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PGR_mx/status/653263904349425664", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Iguala?src=hash", "http://t.co/i5S4hWNQ1u", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Transparencia?src=hash", "http://t.co/ZK5J5FaHSv", "http://www.pgr.gob.mx/Transparencia/Paginas/Expediente-Caso-Iguala.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-12T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:17:32.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
