We booked our trip with Overseas Adventure Travel, who supplied all of our transportation, accommodations, guides and most meals, including a home-hosted lunch featuring local dishes.\" NORWAY: Alamo residents Tom and Melva Hansen (standing) and Danville residents Bernie and Jean Elissagaray are just back from a trip to ports in Iceland, England, Russia, Sweden and Norway, which included a stop in Geirangerfjord, Norway, where they took pictures with a new friend. The troll, Jean says, is a myth to the people of Norway. (Courtesy of the Elissagaray Family) \nTravel tips: It's important that travelers understand the physical requirements a trip to Machu Picchu entails, \"such as the ability to climb many steps without handrails to access the Inca ruins, and being able to tolerate altitudes up to 11,000 feet. Walking sticks were available at reasonable prices in Peru, and we brought with us altitude sickness medicine which we obtained from our HMO.\" Courtesy of the Elissagaray Family NORWAY: Alamo residents Tom and Melva Hansen (standing) and Danville residents Bernie and Jean Elissagaray are just back from a trip to ports in Iceland, England, Russia, Sweden and Norway.

Courtesy of the Suri Family ARGENTINA: Sunnyvale's Suri family -- Mahesh, Aman, Rovina and Aneka -- are just back from a South American trek that included Argentina's Iguazu Falls and Brazil's Sugarloaf Mountain, in Rio de Janeiro. \"Iguazu Falls are considered one of the new wonders of the world and rightfully so. The falls are spectacular!\" Rovina says. \"There are more than 270 falls in an area where cliffs and islets are scattered in a half moon.\" \nTravel tips: At Iguazu, \"you can walk around trails or (ride) a picturesque train. There are two basic circuits: an upper path and a lower path. The Argentine government has done a fantastic job of building pedestrian bridges that allow people to cross over the small falls that are created by the big falls. I would highly recommend staying at the park, rather than in the town of Iguazu, since you can walk to the park at any time. There are lots of monkeys, anteaters, colorful birds and butterflies at the park. There is also a canteen where one can eat.\" Share your travels with us!
