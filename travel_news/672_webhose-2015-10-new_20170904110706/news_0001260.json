Eventually, Willy’s Jeep became the chosen model,sharing production with Ford to keep up with the huge number of vehicles and parts required.\nThroughout the War, Willys produced 363,000 and Ford produced around 280,000. This Jeep was one of the first to be produced, on 23 June 1942.\nIt travelled to England on a convoy, and from there its history is unknown. It is entirely likely that it saw service in Europe, and could well have been used at the D-Day landings.\nThe Jeep was demilitarised in 1947 and sold on, having been last based at the Catterick Army base. The auction will take place next Friday.\nLast updated Fri 9 Oct 2015 Travel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:11:46.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
