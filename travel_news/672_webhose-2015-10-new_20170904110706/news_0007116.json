This was a busy week, with lots of lengthy motorway journeys involving no small number of traffic jams. But the V60 is an accomplished long-distance cruiser, and was perfectly at home on whatever part of the UK’s road network I happened to be doing battle with. Even around the multiplicity of roundabouts at Milton Keynes, which is usually sufficient to incite an outpouring of rage, it was a joy to be behind the wheel. How many miles did you cover? What was the average mpg? I put about 800 miles on the car in the space of a week, and transported a good number of passengers. The V60 proved comfortable, capacious and extremely smooth. An average fuel consumption of 66mpg – with a high of 76mpg during a late-night amble along the M3 – was extremely welcome. What most surprised you about this car? When the car was delivered to my home, I suspected it wouldn’t be big enough for the four-passenger, one-dog, six-suitcase journey I had planned that weekend. But it is deceptively commodious, meaning you can load it up with gear and still find additional space for last-minute essentials like wet wipes, emergency cereal bars and large cappuccinos. More than that, it’s a very relaxing environment to spend time in, even when it’s packed to the gunwales. What piece of technology did you most appreciate on the car? The sat nav came into its own around Milton Keynes. It was late at night, I was exhausted after a long day of meetings, and I needed to locate my hotel in the heart of the town. Thanks to the V60, this experience was straightforward, and I was sat in the bar nursing a cold beer in no time at all. What impact did this car have on your driving? You might imagine that the souped-up R-Design would make you drive more quickly. But for me, the tautness of the V60 in this trim level just made me more attentive. I felt connected to the world around me, and responsive to conditions, other drivers and the road surface. As if I was part of the car, and we were working together seamlessly. It’s what driving a sports car is like, which is a pretty good endorsement of Volvo’s achievement with this vehicle. What’s good about this car from a business driver’s perspective? Apart from the great driving experience and brilliant fuel economy, I think it’s the innate safety of the V60 that will appeal most to business drivers. You’re getting a car that helps minimise the risk of accidents, thanks to equipment like Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) and Active Cruise Control, and provides class-leading protection if one does happen. Whether you’re driving solo, with colleagues or loaded up with the family (I did all three), that brings welcome reassurance. Did anything unusual happen while you had the car? I got a parking ticket in Milton Keynes, because I entered the wrong registration number on the parking app. But it was rescinded when I appealed, on the basis that I had paid for overnight parking, just for the wrong car. I like to think the fact I was driving a Volvo helped create a good impression of me as a person: honest, trustworthy, altruistic, and so forth. What did your family make of the car? They loved it. But more importantly, the builders I had round to renovate my house were completely smitten with it. “It’s a long way from the Volvo estate my Dad had when I was younger,” one commented, while another remarked on the sharp styling and cool alloys. Of course, for my son – obsessed with both builders and Volvos just now – this was a slam-dunk: “Builders like Volvo!” he squealed, with undeniable logic. “Daddy buy a Volvo!” What makes this car stand out from the competition? I think the V60 is the most beautiful car in its class. That would be enough to set it apart from the competition, but it’s also astonishingly frugal, extremely comfortable and amazingly safe. Yup, it’s a very distinctive automobile, this one. What would you tell your best friend about this car? You know when we were young we dreamed of owning a sporty car that had a prestigious image? And you know how now we’re middle-aged, we have to drive sensible estate cars that can be piled up with kit? With the V60 R-Design, it’s possible to achieve both things at once: a sporty car that’s also extremely practical.
