These service expansions are great indicators that we are meeting the needs and expectations of businesses who import and export goods through Rickenbacker,” said Elaine Roberts, President & CEO of Columbus Regional Airport Authority which operates Rickenbacker. “The demand is here and we are grateful to our partners in the Columbus Region who have helped us cultivate relationships in the local and international business community, helping all of us become stronger and more successful. We’ll continue to work very closely with Cathay Pacific and Emirates to ensure first-class customer service.”\nCathay Pacific, which began scheduled international service between Rickenbacker and Hong Kong in 2014, will add a fourth weekly frequency to Columbus beginning October 13.\nThis new Tuesday frequency is currently slated as a seasonal addition through the end of the year.\n“We have been very pleased with our operation at Rickenbacker International Airport and our customers have been happy with the speed and reliability of our import and export services through the Columbus Region,” said Bridget Bell, Cargo Manager – Midwest USA for Cathay Pacific. “With peak season approaching, this additional frequency will help to meet the increasing demand for our services. We expect both new and existing customers will take full advantage of this expansion in order to successfully move goods around the world on our\nextensive network.”\nEmirates SkyCargo began offering scheduled import service from Dubai just four months ago and is already adding a second frequency to its schedule beginning October 3. Emirates plansto continue operating the new Saturday flight, which compliments their initial Wednesdayfrequency, even after peak season.\n“When we began offering weekly import services from Dubai earlier this year, we knew there\nwas potential for expansion rather quickly,” said Hiran Perera, Senior Vice President of Cargo Planning and Freighters for Emirates. “Rickenbacker is one of the best run airports we have ever worked with and we do business with airports around the world. We are equally\nimpressed by the business community in the Columbus Region and we’d like to work together to formulate more strategic partnerships for mutual growth opportunities.”\nSource:- Columbus Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:13:49.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
