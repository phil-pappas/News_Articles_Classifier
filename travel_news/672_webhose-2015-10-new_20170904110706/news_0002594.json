Few players can testify to the lessons Chinese football can learn from leagues in England and Scotland as well as Fan Zhiyi. The former centre back, who featured for China at the 2002 World Cup, the nation’s only appearance in the finals, played 88 times for Crystal Palace between 1998 and 2001 and also had spells with Dundee and Cardiff City. “The advanced training methods and professional support, as well as the youth team set-up, really opened our eyes back then,” said Mr Fan, who is now passing on his experience as the youth programme director with Shanghai Shenhua FC. During his time in Britain, fellow countrymen Sun Jihai and Li Tie also signed for Manchester City and Everton respectively. Mr Sun, now with Chongqing Lifan in the Chinese Super League, signed for the Blues for £2 million and in 2002 was the first Chinese player to score a Premier League goal.

Zheng Zhi, the current China captain, also played for Charlton Athletic and Celtic in the late 2000s. However, in recent years more Chinese have headed to British universities to learn the game and the industry as a whole than have signed lucrative club contracts. The University of Liverpool’s football industries MBA has attracted many applicants from China who want to learn from the home of modern football. The 12-month programme, which since 1997 has been run jointly by the university’s school of management, the Football Association and Liverpool FC, offers practical curricula and internship opportunities. So far, it is the only one of its kind in the world and since the early 2000s has enrolled 40 Chinese students, said Geoff Pearson, the director of studies. “We’ve always had good levels of applicants from China, even though some didn’t have a football background,” he said. “Our geographical location opens up opportunities. We link up with Liverpool, Wigan Athletic and Manchester City for practical parts of the course.” Bobby Houghton, who coached the Chinese national team for two years in the late 1990s Photo: Xinhua / agencies The internships allow students to get involved in every aspect of a club’s operations, from public relations to player management, he added. Qiu Xiaojie, who graduated from the programme in 2006 and now works with Nike’s football division, said: “The wide range of practical management courses and vocational training from top executives at Premier League clubs benefited me greatly and opened my eyes.” Stars from the British game have also been making the trip to China. For example, former Chelsea strikers Nicolas Anelka, Didier Drogba and Demba Ba have all featured for Shanghai Shenhua FC, the latter signing for a record £11 million in the summer. What has made a bigger impact, though, has been the work off the pitch. Mr Beckham has visited China several times as part of promotions targeted at youth players, either leading training sessions or attending events to raise funds for junior leagues. He also accepted a one-year role in 2013 to act as an ambassador for the Chinese FA’s youth programme and the Chinese Super League. “It’s important for me to be able to educate the children to go into one of the greatest sports in the world,” the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy midfielder said at the time. “I know how important the youth system is and I did a lot of work (on youth training) in Europe and America. Hopefully I can do it here as well.” After ending his ambassadorial role, Mr Beckham has continued to be involved with Chinese football. A fund he launched with China Soong Ching Ling Foundation last year has helped upgrade football facilities at several schools in underdeveloped areas, particularly in the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region. “His star power and the fund will attract more attention to Xinjiang football and will help improve the conditions here for children,” said Abulahet Amulism, director of the region’s football administrative centre. One goal in the government’s reform plan is to increase the number of schools nationwide offering specialised football programmes from the current 5,000 to 50,000 within the next 15 years. The Manchester United crest Photo: Xinhua / agencies British companies have also seen the potential in Chinese football and have attempted to establish a presence in the market, such as Jaguar Land Rover , which has been helping Chinese young people to go on sports exchanges. The automaker teamed up with the British Council’s Premier Skills youth programme to help about 30 Chinese students and a group of referees to travel to take part in various football activities in Britain as well as to watch Premier League matches, funded by the company’s Children and Youth Dream Fund. “The exchange is a wonderful opportunity for children to broaden their horizons, get to know their British counterparts and learn from the best of British football,” said Ni Jian, charge d’affaires at the Chinese Embassy in London. Xu Jiayin, owner of Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao FC, one of China’s most successful teams, agreed and added that exchanges in youth talent, club management and coaching development were far more vital to China’s long-term football dreams than big-money transfers.
