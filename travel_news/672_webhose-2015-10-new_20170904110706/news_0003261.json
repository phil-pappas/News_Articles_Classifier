Thrusting up between and towering above are blushing pink blooms, adding lollipops of colour to the myriad shades of green.\nBranches of a tree bow under the weight of little pied cormorants, their black and white attire giving rise to their moniker as penguins of the Top End.\nKakadu National Park, in Australia’s Northern Territory, is home to around 290 bird species, about one-third of Australia’s total. Mamukala Wetlands, part of the South Alligator River flood plain and the first major stop on the Arnhem Highway from Darwin, is visited by an estimated 60 species of water birds, some on a seasonal basis and from as far away as the sub-Arctic.\nOther Stories ‘It’s hard to accept... the cruelty on their bodies’ News 0 comments Who were Playboy’s Aussie stars?

Picture: Kakadu Tourism Towards the end of the dry season, as the wetlands shrink, they provide home to thousands of magpie geese, which were once an important food source for the local Bininj people. The geese rummage for water chestnuts buried in the mud at the base of spike-rushes, hence their bottoms-up profile as I watch from a bird hide.\nIt’s a similar scene at Anbangbang billabong, where we picnic under a shady paperbark tree listening to the high pitched whistles of green pygmy geese. Signs warn not to get too close to the water due to the possibility of crocodiles, so we take the circular walk through the fringing paperbark swamp, dry at this time of year.\nA flash of orange darting between the trees brings my first glimpse of a rainbow bee-eater, a tiny bird which lives up to its colourful name and is Australia’s only bee-eater. Equally small and jauntily flicking fanned-tails are spritely willie wagtails.\nRaucous squawking in the upper branches of a paperbark turns out to be a flock of red-tailed black cockatoos.\nI’m no twitcher – a serious birdwatcher – and I haven’t come to Kakadu for the bird life, but the sheer number and variety of birds is beguiling.\nA majestic jabiru goes fishing. Picture: iStock On a Yellow Water’s sunset cruise I lose count of the number of birds we see, along with lazing crocodiles, grazing water buffalo and brumbies.\nIt’s here I see my first Jesus bird, or comb-crested jacana, picking its way across lotus leaves. Its common name derives from its ability to “walk on water”, or at least lily pads, thanks to enormous splayed feet, which are almost the same length as its legs.\nOur enthusiastic guide points out a tiny azure kingfisher, dazzling in topcoat of violet blue over an orange undershirt. Scanning for much larger fish is a pair of white-bellied sea eagles, Australia’s second largest bird of prey, with a wingspan in excess of 2 metres.\nReflections lengthen on the water; snake-necked darters outstretch wings to dry; glossy ibis flash iridescent-green plumage; and majestic jabiru and brolgas stalk through the reeds.\nAs smoke from burn-offs tinges the air and the sinking sun silhouettes pandanus against an orange sky, magpie geese take to the air. It’s estimated more than three million of them call Kakadu home. Watching wave after V-shaped wave crowd the sky at twilight is truly a spectacle.\nSo seductive is Yellow Water, we come back for a sunrise cruise, and the transformation is magical. Mist swirls over the water as geese return across a pink-tinged sky. Every few metres a croc sashays through the water.\nElegant white egrets are the supermodels of the wetlands. Picture: iStock But again it’s the birds that excite – nankeen night herons, a pheasant coucal and the elusive little kingfisher. I think I feel a twitch coming on.\nTIPS\n● Take binoculars to enhance your viewing of distant birds.\n● Download the Kakadu Bird App which includes more than 50 birds by region.\n● Read up.
