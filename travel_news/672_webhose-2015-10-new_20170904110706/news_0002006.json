Kennedy International Airport and other airports. \nFederal officials say the Department of Homeland Security computer system went down for about 90 minutes Wednesday night. \nIt caused backups at Kennedy Airport and other international airports. \nCustoms and Border Protection said in a statement there was no indication the service disruption was malicious in nature. It said customs experienced a temporary outage with its processing systems at airports of entry in the United States. \nIt's not clear what caused the problem. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:58:19.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
