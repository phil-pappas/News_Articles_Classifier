This commitment came about in an effort to keep the Calgary Opera at its historical location while plans develop around the Opera's future new location. \nThe former Wesley United Church, a local landmark and home to Calgary Opera, is now known as the Mamdani Opera Centre. Riaz Mamdani, is the CEO of one of Canada's largest privately held real estate companies, Strategic Group. Established in 2001, Riaz has expanded its real estate portfolio into a successful investment company with subsidiaries in a variety of industries. \nThe Mamdani Opera Centre is more than just a home for Calgary Opera; it is a community hub that supports over 40 groups, such as Decidedly Jazz Danceworks, Spiritus Chamber Choir, Red Deer Symphony and One Yellow Rabbit Theatre that utilize the Centre for rehearsal and event space every year. \nIn July of 2005, Calgary Opera took over the historically designated Wesley United Church, converting it into the Calgary Opera Centre. Located in the Beltline District, at the corner of 14th Avenue and 7th Street S.W., this beautiful heritage building has taken Calgary Opera to a whole new level offering unprecedented opportunities for community connections and artistic development. \"This building has a rich heritage but also plays an important role in providing much needed facility space for today's cultural community,\" said Calgary Opera General Director & CEO, W.R. (Bob) McPhee C.M. \"We are proud to continue to call it home and thank Mr. Mamdani for keeping it in the family.\" \nSupporting our community's art and culture initiatives is very important to Mr. Mamdani and to Strategic Group who have established values of making an impact with partnerships and are committed to building legacies through continued involvement. \"I am very aware of the impact the opera has on our city. In my view, to be able to make an impact to our community with an organization that is creative and unconventional makes for a great partner,\" Mr. Mamdani says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:00:17.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
