Completing the course gives consultants the edge by offering them a certified specialist logo for display on any of their collaterals. \n\nVietnam and the Philippines will be the latest South-east Asian nations being offered the programme with the course already being offered in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. \n\nBreiter noted that since Switzerland Tourism started promoting in the Philippines a year ago, the number of overnight stays has grown 24.3 per cent to 30,000. He expects a yearly growth rate of 15 per cent from the Philippines until 2018 to 45,000 room nights. \n\nSwitzerland Tourism also have plans to place a dedicated person in the Switzerland Embassy in Manila take care of tourism promotions in the Philippines by 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:45:55.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
