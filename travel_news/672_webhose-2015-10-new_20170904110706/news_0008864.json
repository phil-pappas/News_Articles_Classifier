M&I Forums are industry-leading trade events that feature intensive business networking held at the world’s leading meetings destinations. The forum focuses completely on the business events industry with buyers from traditional and emerging markets converging in destinations across Europe, the Middle East and the US.

The 2016 editions will place Dubai in the spotlight along with Scottsdale, AZ (USA), Madrid (Spain), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Prague (Czech Republic) and Izmir (Turkey). Commenting on the return of the M&I Forum to Dubai, Richard Barnes, Managing Director of M&I Forums said: “Our return to Dubai signals the rise of Dubai as a global hub for business events. During our maiden outing to the city earlier this year, the buyers were impressed by the standard of its facilities and its ambition to develop it further. There is a growing appetite amongst buyers to forge strong networks in this market and its current pace of investment in the sector is only accelerating Dubai’s development as one of the premier business event destinations in the world.” Delegates at M&I Forum Europe Spring will get access to Dubai’s world-class transportation, hotels and meetings facilities. With a number of hotels under construction and several mega-entertainment sites in the making, including Dubai Parks & Resorts and Dubai Opera, the Forum will showcase Dubai’s potential as the efficient host of international meetings and conferences. With three international terminals dedicated to linking Dubai to over 260 destinations around the globe, the city’s accessibility to traditional and emerging source markets is also a pivotal factor in attracting international businesses and business travellers to the city. Also on the agenda will be a number of dinners and receptions at some of Dubai’s many unique venues, including evening functions in the desert.
