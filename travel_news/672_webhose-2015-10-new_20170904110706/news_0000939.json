PETERSBURG, Fla. , Oct. 21, Squaremouth , a leading travel insurance comparison website headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida , has been named No. 20 on the 2015 list of Best Small Workplaces by Fortune magazine and Great Place to Work.\nThis is Squaremouth's first time on the list, now in its 11th year, which recognizes companies with exceptional workplace cultures. The award follows Squaremouth's recognition last month as the No. 2 Best Workplace for Women in the nation .\nSquaremouth's unique culture is built on the CEO's mantra that in order to be the best company for its customers to buy from, it must be the best company for its employees to work for. This is accomplished by fostering an offbeat workplace with perks designed to motivate and reward staff. By building a culture and workplace around its people, Squaremouth has built a workplace that naturally promotes employee satisfaction.\nThe company offers its employees a number of sought-after benefits, including unlimited vacation time with a required 10 days off, quarterly bonuses, birthdays off with a $200 beer bonus, and occasional surprise gifts â€“ most recently gifting employees with Apple Watches. While these perks make Squaremouth an appealing place to work, it is the strong camaraderie formed among colleagues that most staff cite as the best part of working at the company.\n\"The people are the whole reason the culture and atmosphere works, and the reason we are able to do what we do,\" said Squaremouth Compliance Manager Aidan Harvey . \"We are a tight-knit team, but we also work autonomously in our individual departments, so everyone can trust everyone else to get their part of the job done. It all makes for a stress-free, fun and successful environment to work in.\"\nUnderstanding the importance of attracting and retaining outstanding people, Squaremouth operates on the philosophy \"Love what you do; if you don't, build yourself a new job.\" This encourages staff to seek out work they're passionate about and facilitates continued satisfaction in the workplace.\n\"I have never worked in an environment where you really have the ability to create your job,\" said Zero Complaint Manager Brandi Morse , who started with Squaremouth as a part-time customer service representative in 2011. \"This is the first place I've worked that has made me proud to be a part of the team and made me feel I am truly appreciated. I love being a part of a company that is continually growing and willing to help me grow in return.\"\nABOUT SQUAREMOUTH\nSquaremouth is an online company that compares travel insurance products from virtually every major travel insurance provider in the United States .
