Routes to Abu Dhabi, Muscat, Kuala Lumpur and Austin will follow.\nA larger incarnation of the 787-8, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner is 206 feet long -- 20 feet longer than its predecessor -- and holds 290 passengers. It has a flight range of 8,200 nautical miles.\nComposite materials make up 50% of the primary structure, including the fuselage and wings, making it 20% more fuel efficient than traditional commercial jets made with aluminum.\nThe first 787-9 rolled off the assembly line in Everett in 2013 and was delivered to its first customer, New Zealand Airlines, last year.\nThe next Dreamliner, the 787-10, is expected to begin commercial service in 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:20:16.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
