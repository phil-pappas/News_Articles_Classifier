It is our goal to provide our members and guests with the best club and resort experience possible as well as a distinctive level of personalized service that is second to none, and by merit of this award, we are gratified to know our goal has been realized.”\n \nThe award comes on the heels of the reopening of Bay Hill’s Championship Course following an extensive re-grassing project in Summer 2015, in which new TifEagle bermudagrass was sprigged on the greens, and Celebration bermudagrass on the fairways and tees of all 18 holes. Mr. Easler went on to say, “we are very excited to have just completed a comprehensive re-grassing project and the response from members and guests who have played the course since reopening has been overwhelmingly positive. We are anticipating truly exceptional course conditions for this year’s TOUR event in March.”\n \nAs the global trade organization for the golf tourism industry, IAGTO conducts annual awards to recognize the best performing golf resorts in three regions: North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World. Over 500 IAGTO golf tour operators in 62 countries vote based on criteria including customer satisfaction, course quality, accommodations, accessibility to tee times, overall value, levels of service, and the professionalism which the organization works with in the industry and with tour operators.\n \nAccepting the award at the 2016 IAGTO Awards ceremony on the Spanish island of Tenerife, Bay Hill’s Director of Sales & Marketing, Roy Schindele, said: “On behalf of the Palmer family as well as entire staff, we are honored to receive this prestigious award. We continually strive to offer all our guests a superior experience and one of the unique qualities that makes Bay Hill so distinctive is the level of service provided by our attentive staff, each of whom has a personal commitment to welcome each guest to the winter home of Arnold Palmer and to treat them like family.”\n \nLocated just minutes from downtown Orlando along the Butler chain of lakes, Arnold Palmer’s Bay Hill Club & Lodge is the site of the annual Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard golf tournament. The 70-room property features 27-holes of golf, the Arnold Palmer Golf Academy, tennis on four Har-tru and two DecoTurf courts, a full service spa and salon, fitness center, a heated Jr. Olympic-size pool, three dining locations, 3 lounges, and 9,000 square eet of meeting and banquet space.\n \nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:19:17.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
