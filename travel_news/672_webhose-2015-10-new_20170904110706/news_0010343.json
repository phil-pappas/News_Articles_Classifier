She was nervous about juggling her months-old daughter, Rylee, as well as all their luggage. Things didn’t improve when she boarded her Spirit Airlines flight from Chicago to Atlanta . \n“As soon as we got on the plane at 5:30 a.m., it was very quiet and it was a full flight,” Garvison wrote on Facebook. \nShe said the couple sitting next to her was not happy. \n“I could tell by their body language sitting right next to me that they weren’t thrilled about sitting next to Rylee,” Garvison wrote. \nTo make matters worse, Rylee started fussing just as the plane was pulling onto the runway. \nFlight attendants allowed Garvison to move to an emptier row. She said the woman sitting next to her completely turned her day around. \n“Rylee wouldn’t stop crying no matter what I would try and do … so she had asked if I didn’t mind if she tried,” Garvison wrote. “As soon as she had her, Rylee was looking out the window and stopped crying. When we got in the air, she fell right asleep and slept in her lap the whole flight until we got to our gate.” \nThe woman even carried Rylee off the plane so her mother could grab the stroller. \nGarvison thanked the woman, identified as Nyfesha Miller, in her post. \n“You will never understand how happy this act of kindness made my family. You could have just rolled your eyes and been irritated like everyone else, but you took her and held her the entire flight and let me get some rest and peace of mind,” Garvison wrote. “It brought tears to my eyes while I sat there and watched you and Rylee sleeping next to me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:53:36.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
