Highway: Conservation Service CP Updated: 1 hour ago \nKERMODE BEAR A Kermode bear, also known as spirit bear, was reported to the COS Hotline being hit on Highway 37 near Smithers. A local CO responded and was able to assess the bear’s condition. As the video shows the bear and her cubs were mobile and actively feeding with no visible injuries. A very positive outcome and a rare encounter! Please contact the Conservation Officer 24/7 hotline at 1-877-952-7277 to report injured wildlife Posted by Conservation Officer Service on Wednesday, September 30, 2015 ADVERTISEMENT B.C. Conservation Service \nSMITHERS, B.C. - The white Kermode bear is usually a rare sight in British Columbia, but a motorist on Highway 37 in the province's northwest couldn't avoid hitting the animal. \nA caller to the B.C. Conservation Officer Service hotline reported that a vehicle struck a Kermode near Smithers and that it wasn't possible to determine the bear's condition. \nThe conservation service sent an officer to the area, and a mother bear was spotted meandering along the highway with her two black cubs. \nA video of all three bears has been posted on the service's Facebook site, and it shows them moving about, eating, and apparently without any injuries. \nThe Kermode is a rare subspecies of the black bear and a recessive gene gives some of the animals a white coat though they are not albino or related to the polar bear. \nThe Kermode or so-called spirit bear is B.C.'s provincial mammal and is found on the central and north coast. \nRelated on HuffPost: Spirit Bear In Great Bear Rainforest of   Lucky wildlife photographer and writer Nick Garbutt got within five metres with this spirit bear in B.C. After some sniffing, posturing and a little thought the bear decided that Nick was nothing to be concerned about and went back to fishing for salmon, allowing Nick to get these superb shots. The spirit bear, a distinct and rare genetic variant of the more common and widely distributed black bear, is an extraordinary sight, appearing to glow ghost-like in the dark, primordial forests it inhabits. In the Great Bear Rainforest, there is only one spirit bear for every 10 regular black bears, so Nick believes he encountered one of only around 300 in the world.

In a moss-draped rain forest in British Columbia, towering red cedars live a thousand years, and black bears are born with white fur. With a population of 400 to as many as a thousand, the spirit bear may owe its survival to the protective traditions of the First Nations, who never hunted the animals or spoke of them to fur trappers. Two adult males tussle over a prime fishing spot in a river. \"Bear scraps are rare events,\" says Doug Neasloss, a Kitasoo/Xai'xais wildlife guide. \"There's a high potential for injury, so they avoid conflict if they can.\" With a pink salmon in its jaws, a five-year-old male retreats into the forest before slitting open the fish's belly and eating only the eggs. Other bears may consume everything, from head to tail. In a forest dominated by second-growth trees, a young bear settles into a mossy day bed at the foot of a giant, old-growth western red cedar. Bears use such day beds to rest and sleep after a meal. These photos are in the August 2011 issue of National Geographic magazine, on newsstands now.
