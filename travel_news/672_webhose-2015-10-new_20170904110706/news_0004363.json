Picture: Mispahn\nKate Schneider news.com.au SOMETIMES, it seems like city planners must have it in for us.\nThere are some bustling cities that are very hard to explore due to their design, whether it be a lack of pedestrian access or streets that make no sense when you try to navigate them.\nFrom our very own Sydney to Jakarta and South Korea, here are some cities that are quite challenging to explore.\n1. DUBAI, UAE\nFor a place that has spared no expense in the battle to be the biggest and best at everything — from its dazzling skyscrapers to its gigantic shopping centres and fleet of luxury police supercars — there’s one major oversight.\nIt’s incredibly difficult to walk around outside of its attractions and buildings due to a lack of pedestrian walkways. And, with its roads full of cars going at top speeds, you can’t just nick across the street wherever you like.\nJust want to stroll over from the shopping centre back to your hotel? Yeah right. There’s a reason people drive everywhere.\nGet ready to hop in a car in Dubai. Picture: Fabio Achilli\n2. DHAKA, BANGLADESH\nThis statistic gives an indication of what it’s like getting around here; in Dhaka, there are 650 major intersections but just 60 traffic lights to deal with millions of vehicles. And many of those don’t work.\nThat’s a sign of the broader problems facing this city that has boomed from a population of 1.2 million in 1970 to more than 14 million now.\nAs the Bangladesh Financial Express reports: “Decades of unplanned urbanisation has given birth to unbearable traffic congestions, environmental pollution, waterlogging during rains and many such problems.”\nBecause it’s so hard to get in and out of Dhaka, many people are forced to live in poor conditions on the outskirts of the city, Thrillist reports.\nDhaka is one of the most overpopulated cities in the world.\n3. JAKARTA, INDONESIA\nThe situation in the Indonesian capital is so bad that it was this year named the place with the worst traffic in the world.\nDrivers spend an average of 400 hours each year getting to and from work, according to Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) research, the Jakarta Post reports.\nAnd with the number of car owners climbing, amid a lacking public transport system and a population of nearly 10 million, something needs to be done urgently.\nJakarta’s congestion.

BOSTON, US\nBoston’s layout is so confusing that scientists have even weighed in on it.\nThe historical city’s winding, crooked streets, which were formerly paths for cows, were built to no particular planned pattern. But scientist and data visualiser Seth Kadish believes the confusing layout has worsened due to the lack of north, south, east and west orientation on the streets, Boston.com reports.\n“If you’re like me, and you use the sun to navigate, you probably appreciate cities with gridded street plans that are oriented in the cardinal directions,” Mr Kadish wrote on his blog the Visual Statistix .\n“If you know that your destination is due west, even if you hit a dead end or two, you’ll be able to get there. I was always amazed by the crazy Boston streets.”\nMind-boggling Boston. Picture: Art N.\n5. LAGOS, NIGERIA\nWith hidden traffic signs, large potholes in the roads and many drivers rumoured to have never gone to driving school, it’s a challenge to get around Lagos.\nThe article 25 Rules of Engagement: Lagos Driving lesson 101 by local website Vanguard has some tongue-in-cheek pointers for the uninitiated including: “When in doubt, accelerate”, “there is no such thing as ‘one-way’ in Lagos” and “never, ever, stop for a pedestrian unless he flings himself under the wheels of your car”.\nLagos, Nigeria.

Good luck with the navigating, everybody!\nSydney, what were you thinking?\nNow that’s more like it, Melbourne.\nStunning Eagle's-Eye View of Dubai 1:51 Darshan the eagle flew from atop the Burj Khalifa in Dubai on Saturday, setting the world record for the \"highest recorded bird flight from a man-made structure.\"\nMarch 15th 2015 7 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/Travel/ Jump back to top", "external_links": ["http://www.eharmony.com.au/partner/news/?cid=116562&aid=100&utm_source=news.com.au&utm_medium=Widget&utm_campaign=Kimmy_Widget", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/da6899674fb9c6733b9fc8839811448d", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/31c577e20c8bccc608188da89ab29bd8", "http://vizual-statistix.tumblr.com/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/17272ee2f3e9d2a4694d98f97c312af2", "http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/index.php?ref=MjBfMDRfMTlfMTNfMV8xNTFfMTY2ODY2", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/20b0845fcdf198b5c7fd28de76306d06", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9c0e033f4241d145ef4eefe9286bb206", "http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118416/what-dhaka-bangladesh-traffic-capital-world-can-teach-us", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fgenerated%2Fprod%2F05%2F06%2F2015%2F37709%2Fimage1024x768.jpg%3Fcount%3D2&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.boston.com/news/local/blogs/starts-and-stops/2014/04/02/the-real-reason-why-boston-geography-the-most-confusing-thing-ever/yBZ2MOEYlLbYl9Jgb0BE2N/blog.html", "http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/02/09/jakartans-spend-400-hours-a-year-traffic-says-survey.html", "http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/07/25-rules-of-engagement-lagos-driving-lesson-101/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/95dbb2a73acac432470138f67fecc95c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/97558f7794d65c9cb99d6172a96b229c", "https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/cities-with-the-worst-urban-planning-jakarta-dubai-and-dhaka-top-our-list?share=c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5e4de55b1531d80346c883d5f9bde753", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:59:48.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
