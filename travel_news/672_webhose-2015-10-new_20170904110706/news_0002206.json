It also features footage of the spectacular scenery in this part of Ireland, including the Cliffs of Moher.\nFollowing the historic ‘yes’ vote in last May’s marriage referendum, Tourism Ireland rolled out a special LGBT campaign, which featured a video showcasing our spectacular scenery and The Outing. Tourism Ireland’s latest film, unveiled today, will be promoted on a specially-created section on the organisation’s website, Ireland.com. Tourism Ireland will also share the film on social media – with its Facebook fans (3+ million fans worldwide) and Twitter followers (300,000+), and on its YouTube channel.\nNiall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “Research unveiled at World Travel Market last year showed the annual spend on travel by LGBT people exceeded USD$200 billion for the first time in 2014. Ireland’s ‘yes’ vote in May also delivered a strong message of tolerance, respect and open-mindedness, positioning Ireland as a welcoming destination for LGBT travellers. We are delighted to unveil our latest online film, highlighting The Outing and promoting Ireland to LGBT couples around the world, encouraging them to consider Ireland for their wedding or honeymoon.”\nSource:- Tourism Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:04:01.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
