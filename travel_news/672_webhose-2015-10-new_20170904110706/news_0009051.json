(OTC: FARE) (BERLIN: WM7) ( BERLIN : A1J8SY) (\"World Moto\" or the \"Company\"), a leader in advanced solutions for motorcycle taxis and on-demand transport, today announced that it is launching a new program to provide interested parties with the opportunity to license HailYes™, the Company's smartphone application that instantly connects consumers to transport and commerce services in a local community.\n\"We believe the e-hailing market has reached an inflection point,\" said CEO Paul Giles . \"The market has been developed by closed proprietary platforms to the point where our open, licensed solution can unlock the potential of legions of motivated entrepreneurs who are currently locked out of this opportunity.\"\nGiles continued, \"In the same way that licensing has become a dominant model in many technology sectors, such as smartphones and personal computers, we believe this open licensing program will create a similar impact in the e-hailing market and establish HailYes as a serious competitor to the closed, proprietary models entrenched in the industry today.\"\nHailYes licensees not only get immediate access to an advanced e-hailing platform at a small fraction of what it would cost to develop a similar system, but also receive the benefits of tourists and businessmen that use HailYes ™ and roam into their territory. All the licensees need to do is to register drivers in their area, add users and start making money.\nTo take advantage of the opportunity to become a HailYes™ Licensee, please email hailyes@worldmoto.com\nTo be added to the World Moto email distribution list, please email FARE@kcsa.com with FARE in the subject line.\nAbout World Moto\nWorld Moto is a technology company that designs, manufactures, markets and sells Moto-Meter products, devices that provide moto-taxi fare metering and other communication capabilities.
