(Bangkok Airways photo) - + How easy it looks Bangkok Airways has launched regular flights serving the much-sought and long-neglected Phuket-Hat Yai route. \nThe SET-listed full-service carrier became the first and only commercial airline to operate on the route when its maiden flight departed from the southern resort island on Sunday. \nBangkok Airways offers one daily flight to cash in demand untapped by scheduled carriers. \nThe Phuket-Hat Yai route was served by budget airline Nok Air more than five years ago, but was later suspended because the 150-seat Boeing 737 deployed on the route offered more capacity than needed. \nBangkok Airways is using the ATR-72 500/600-family turboprops for Phuket-Hat Yai and the 70-seat capacity appears to match current passenger demand, according to Prote Setsuwan, the carrier's vice president for marketing. \nThere has been a call, particularly from the business community, for an air link between the Phuket and Hat Yai as both are economically important and land travel between the two cities can take some five hours. \nBangkok Airways' Phuket-Hat Yai flight takes 55 minutes. \nFlight PG298 departs from Phuket at 7.25am and arrives in Hat Yai at 8.30am. PG299 returns to Phuket at 9.10am, arriving at 10.15am. \nThe Tourism Authority of Thailand said the establishment of an air link will enhance tourism for both southern cities. \nPhuket-Hat Yai is the fifth route out of Phuket operated by Bangkok Airways. It also offers eight flights a day between Phuket and Bangkok, one between Phuket and Chiang Mai, four flights on the Phuket-Samui route, and one flight a day between Phuket and U-tapao airport in Rayong. \nGet full Bangkok Post printed newspaper experience on your digital devices with Bangkok Post e-newspaper .
