The Defence Secretary has said British troops will be involved in training, evaluation and capacity-building mission in Poland and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Mr Fallon had said Russia's decision to launch air strikes in Syria is making the situation \"more dangerous\" and said British troops \"will be part of a more persistent presence by Nato forces.\" Nato defence ministers will meet in Brussels later today and Russian air strikes in Syria are expected to be at the top of the day's agenda Photo: Jane Mingay for the Telegraph The Russians insist they are targeting Isil extremists, but Western powers suspect that President Vladimir Putin is targeting rebel groups opposed to the Assad regime. The West fears Russian air strikes are designed to prop up the regime of President Bashar Assad, who David Cameron has said must go as part of any political settlement of Syria's four-year civil war. Mr Fallon said: \"Russia is making a very serious situation in Syria much more dangerous. Syrians gather and use fire extinguishera on the rubble of a building in the aftermath of a Russian airstrike in Dair al-Asafeer village, rural Damascus. Inset: Vladimir Putin leaving a meeting in Paris Photo: AP \"We will be calling on Russia specifically to stop propping up the Assad regime, to use their influence constructively to stop Assad bombing his own civilians and themselves to avoid the use of unguided munitions in areas that are not being controlled by Isil. \"If Russia wants to help here, the single most helpful thing they can do is use their influence on Assad to stop barrel-bombing his own civilians, their children, his own cities and villages. \"That's how Russia could help to resolve this conflict.\" Nato defence ministers will meet in Brussels later today and Russian air strikes in Syria are expected to be at the top of the day's agenda. telepolitics Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:49:46.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
