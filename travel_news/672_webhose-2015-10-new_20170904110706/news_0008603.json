Matt Mauney Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel November brings dinos in SoFla, Fantasy of Flight's rebirth plus what's new at KSC \nA traveling exhibit about the age of dinosaurs opens this month in South Florida, while a poplar Central Florida attraction reopens for the winter season. \nDinosaurs Around the World \nThe South Florida Science Center and Aquarium will be hosting an exhibit that offers a different kind of world geography lesson. \n\"Dinosaurs Around the World\" is produced by Imagine Exhibitions and explores Earth as it was during the time of the dinosaurs. The exhibit, opening Nov. 1, gives guests a \"Passport to Pangea\" as they explore the diversity that existed during the age of the dinosaurs. \nThe exhibit highlights landscapes of the globe that are vastly different from the way we know them today, from the once-tropical beaches of Antarctica to the arid deserts of Brazil. Among the exhibits will be 13 life-sized animatronic dinosaurs with realistic roaring and breathing sound effects to enhance the experience. \nThe exhibit also highlights four U.S. presidents – Bill Clinton, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman – for their work to preserve fossil-rich areas of North America. \nGeneral admission to Dinosaurs Around the World is $16.95, $14.95 for seniors and $12.95 for children 3-12. Museum members are free. \nFor more information, visit sfsciencecenter.org/dinosaurs . \nFantasy of Flight returns \nFantasy of Flight, an aviation-themed attraction in Polk County, is reopening for the winter. \nThe scaled-down interim museum will reopen to the public Nov. 20 and will remain open seasonally from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday through Sunday. The exhibit closed to the public April 6, 2014, to concentrate on its private-event business. \nFantasy of Flight opened in 1995 as the world's largest private collection of vintage aircraft and is known to Florida travelers because of its grounded-airplane signs visible from Interstate 4. \nThe interim museum was set to reopen on Nov. 13, but a private event has pushed that to Nov. 20. \nThe attraction features vintage aircraft dating back to World War I. \nFor more information, visit fofcollection.com . \nTwo new attractions at KSC \nThere may not be any manned launches in the near future but there's still plenty to see at Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. \nVisitors can check out two attractions that were added this year, including the \"Journey to Space\" 3-D film in the complex's IMAX theater and the \"Journey to Mars: Explorers Wanted\" exhibit. \"Journey to Space\" looks at the future of space explorations, while recounting the past and breathing fresh life into historic video footage with 3-D effects. The film is narrated by actor Patrick Stewart. \n\"Journey to Mars: Explorers Wanted\" features a range of interactive games and simulators, letting guests simulate everything from docking a shuttle to the International Space Station to using a jet pack to search for the missing Spirit rover on Mars. \nThe exhibit also takes a look at how we might one day explore and colonize Mars, and what it would take to do so. \nA live theater presentation shows efforts being made at NASA to one day explore the Red Planet. \nOther must-see attractions at KSC include the Space Shuttle Atlantis exhibit, including the Shuttle Launch Experience and the Apollo/Saturn V Center, which is part of the bus tour. \nFor more information, visit kennedyspacecenter.com . \nStarry Night at UF \nThe Florida Museum of Natural History on the campus of the University of Florida is hosting a free stargazing event on Nov. 13. \nThe family-friendly event runs from 6-10 p.m. and is sponsored by the UF Astronomy Department, the Santa Fe Astronomy Program and the Kika Silva Pla Planetarium. \nAttendees will be able to look through high-performance telescopes at the stars, see a portable planetarium show and view a moonscape in 3-D. \nFor more information, visit flmnh.ufl.edu/calendar/grid/starry-night/ .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:29:37.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
