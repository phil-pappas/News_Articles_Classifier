Scoot will operate using a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, a larger capacity plane than Tigerair’s Airbus A320 currently plying the route, in order to better match capacity with demand. Tigerair will also operate additional services on certain dates during next year’s Chinese New Year season. Lee Lik Hsin, CEO of Tigerair, said in a release: “With Scoot operating one tranche of Tigerair service to Guangzhou with their larger aircraft, we jointly serve the market more efficiently. We are also finalising a similar arrangement for another route.“The partnership agreements on these routes are structured to ensure win-win for both sides, and Tigerair can also redeploy resources for expansion to new destinations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:17:42.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
