More than that, it has one thing no other hotel in Britain has – its own source of piping hot thermal water.\nA few rooms have baths with three taps rather than two – the last one being for your own private supply of mineral-enriched, centuries-old water, which comes out of the earth at a 46 degrees via a nearby borehole (thoughtfully, the hotel cools it a bit before it hits your bath).\nUnderstated luxury: Room at the Gainsborough Hotel, Bath\nBut even if you don’t bag one of those rooms, there’s still the hotel spa. It’s reserved for guests for two hours in the morning and the evening – and if you book a treatment, you’ll get access to it between those times.\nTricked out with Romanesque columns and mosaics, there are a series of pools of different heats along with sauna, steam rooms, ice cave and central pool, with sun loungers – and a constant supply of hot chocolate.\n“It’s our nod to the Georgians,” said one of the staff. I nodded approvingly. It’s not a stuffy hotel, there’s a West Country warmth here that seem to flow as easily as the spa water.\nThe Celts may have discovered Bath’s hot water springs around 100 BC, but it was the Romans who used them in buildings that allowed them to soak away the British winter in comfort.\nPretty city: River Avon and Pulteney Bridge in honey-stoned Bath\nFor £14 you can also visit the nearby Roman Baths ( romanbaths.co.uk ), which send you down below ground level to a series of bubbling springs in a complex of buildings only slightly less elaborate than the Gainsborough’s spa.\nA millennium-and-a half later, the ­Georgians lapped it up as everyone who was anyone – including Jane Austen and family – came to Bath. After a major refurb it reopened in 2011.\nI got my own experience of the waters with a Freedom treatment at the Gainsborough spa. Yes, dignity was left at the door but I soon became a convert as the therapist guided me in and under the water. Initially you feel vulnerable, then it’s utterly life-enhancing.\nThe Gainsborough is a collection of buildings that were a hospital, then a college. My friend Simon – who drank at its student bar – barely recognised it.\nEuro nosh: Johann Lafer's restaurant\nNow its 99 rooms are posh and serene, with dark walls, fabulously comfortable beds and glorious Georgian windows looking out at the city and into the hills.\nThere’s a bar where apothecary-style cocktails are dished up and a restaurant with delicious European food (the chef, Johann Lafer is German).\nYes, it’s expensive – cocktails come in at £16 a pop - but the three-course lunch is a bargain at £29.50 and steers clear of any hipster-style slate plates in favour of elegant porcelain.\nAll in all? Jane would definitely approve.\nTravel File The deal: Rooms start at £285, room only, including a free mini-bar and access to the spa. www.thegainsboroughbathspa.co.uk 01225 358 888\nBath Spa for less: Bath Thermae Spa is just across the road and has two thermal pools over three floors including the rooftop pool – all heated to 33.5. A two-hour session starts at £32. Treatments are also available. There’s also the smaller Cross Bath at £18 for 90 minutes. www.thermaebathspa.com 0844 888 0844\nDon't miss: Tea at the Georgian Pump Room, £21pp, booking recommended. www.romanbaths.co.uk\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/", "http://www.thermaebathspa.com/", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.thegainsboroughbathspa.co.uk/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-10-04T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T19:14:15.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
