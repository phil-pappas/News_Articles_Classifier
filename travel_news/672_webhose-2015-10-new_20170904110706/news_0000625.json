North of the Pass summit on the way to the West Coast, the footbridge straddles the Otira River about 6km north of Otira Village, where the Deception and Otira rivers merge. Pat Barrett \nA rainbow almost close enough to touch. \nPositioned right beside SH73 and the West Coast rail link, it's no problem to access and to explore. Just watch the road and the railway line as cars and trains can arrive rapidly and unannounced. \nI took the family over on one of our sorties out west for a bit of instant adventure. It makes a great focus and relief from riding the bitumen strip, and who knows what you might encounter. \nMounting the many steps to the bridge platform propels you into the adventure and the experience that awaits. This is also the transition point for the famous Coast to Coast multi-sport event, so you might see some intrepid types in training, running off up the riverbed if you are observant. \nDon't follow them whatever you do. They have completely lost the plot. Our girls were into it from the moment we hit the boards above and were soon heading out on the surprisingly long crossing as clouds hugged the hills and misty rain refreshed the forest. \nThe river, blue and clear, flashed beneath over its stony bed and the hills beckoned. At mid-bridge a stop is obligatory, to absorb the wonder of it all and the space and beauty that abounds here, before wobbling on over to the far side where a novel descent awaits – a steep swingbridge style access ramp. \nIf you are a little unsteady then this part may not be for you, yet with care and a sure step you will be down in a flash – no pun intended. On the riverbank chaos reigns. You have just been disgorged onto the floodplain of the Otira-Deception confluence - no place to be in a storm or during heavy rain. \nThe outwash of these large rivers has totalled the banks, the trees, and everything else that is not wired down, like the bridge. But don't get too sure about that either, the bridge has been damaged in the past and not so long ago I took a trip out on its swaying carriage in a full-blown flood. Ad Feedback \nThe Otira was clocking 60kmh as it raced beneath, was up at least four metres, turgid, roiling and every so often a solid 'tong' would ring out as another rolling boulder struck the submerged steel girders of the footbridge, which also possessed a continual vibrating resonance from the flood whizzing below. All pretty unnerving, and, unsurprisingly, I didn't tarry. \nThe girls have found some forest to explore nearby, festooned with ferns and creepers; and behold, what is that? A rainbow, dazzling, and very close has projected from the clouds and moved onshore on our side of the river. It is vibrant, thick, and arches magnificently across the valley like a celestial carriage to the sky, and back. \n\"Can we reach it dad?\", is the perennial question. \"Well let's see,\" I venture, knowing full well the outcome. Yet isn't a tad of wonder worth a footfall or two on the way to discovery? We have certainly struck gold on this excursion. \nFact File Access: Directly off SH73, across the railway line, 6km north of Otira Time: 10 minutes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:34:18.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
