However, the Woodland Trust is leading the way to develop solutions to the problem by working with landowners and farmers and bringing many different groups into conversations about the benefits of trees. Conservation experts and scientists at the Trust are supporting landowners to plant a mixed range of species and restore ancient woods. They are also involving them in research and opening up their land for tours. Landowners form a diverse group, including farmers, corporations, utility companies, local authorities, institutional and private investors, the Ministry of Defence, developers, universities and large country estates. The Woodland Trust’s marketing and communications manager, Samantha Coles, says: “Trees are such an integral part of daily life in so many different ways but they are often taken for granted. “I think that for many, we would only truly appreciate what they do for us if they were suddenly not there. The Woodland Trust is dedicated to making sure that doesn’t happen – and raising awareness and working in partnership with many different groups is a vital way of achieving this.” Disease recovery packs The Woodland Trust is inviting landowners to become part of the solution in tackling tree disease through Tree Disease Recovery Packs. Each recovery pack contains a mix of 45 native broadleaf species, protection and stakes, encouraging landowners to regenerate woods. Conservation experts have designed the recovery packs for landowners and they are being trialled in the regions currently most affected – Northumberland, East Sussex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Kent. If successful, the trial will be extended to the rest of the UK. To enquire about a disease recovery pack and the schemes available in other counties, you can speak to the Trust’s expert woodland creation team by emailing plant@woodlandtrust.org.uk or telephoning 0330 333 5303 . Observatree Observatree has identified pests and diseases that have the potential to cause the most serious and widespread impact on commercial forestry, amenity woodland and ecological systems. More than 200 volunteers across the UK have been trained to identify cases of tree disease recorded via the Forestry Commission’s Tree Alert app. These volunteers, working with the group that creates the UK Plant Health Risk Register use an app to alert scientists to any tree health concerns. This partnership between the Woodland Trust, Forest Research, the Forestry Commission, Defra, Natural Resources Wales, FERA, APHA and the National Trust is funded by the EU’s Life programme. UK provenance The trust will only plant trees from seed collected, raised and grown in the UK. Previously UK seeds were permitted to be grown abroad but the Woodland Trust believes that reducing global movement of young trees and seeds can help prevent the spread of tree disease. Woodland eggs It’s not a widely known fact, but chickens are naturally woodland creatures and have “jungle fowl” instincts – that is, they naturally use trees as cover from predators. In woodland, hens forage and roam, spending more time outside and ranging further which, in turn, makes them happier, healthier hens that lay top-quality eggs. The Woodland Trust has partnered with Sainsbury’s since 2004 in a “Woodland Eggs” initiative. Woodland eggs are laid by hens allowed to roam in woodland and for every dozen sold, Sainsbury’s donates 1p to the trust to help fund tree-planting projects throughout the UK. More than £4.5m has been donated in 11 years, resulting in the planting of more than 2.5 million trees. Celtic rainforest This summer, the Woodland Trust launched a campaign to raise £750,000 to buy Llennyrch, 220 hectares of ancient woodland, pasture and heathland in the Snowdonia National Park. The woodland has been described as a “Celtic rainforest” and contains more than 200 species of mosses and liverworts and 200 species of lichen that thrive in humid conditions created by a river flowing through a wooded gorge with many waterfalls. The aim is to protect and improve unique wildlife and open up parts of the site for the public to enjoy. Beccy Speight, chief executive of the Woodland Trust says: “Llennyrch is a magical place but it is also a working agricultural holding. We intend to work with the current farmer to demonstrate the many benefits of trees on farms, showing that productive farming and woodland conservation can go hand in hand.” Find out more at woodlandtrust.org.uk » In video: ash dieback Discover the various methods being employed to reduce tree disease in this insightful video, with expert opinions and recommendations from the Woodland Trust, the Forestry Commission and the Tree Council.
