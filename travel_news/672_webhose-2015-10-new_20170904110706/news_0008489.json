Even more significant is the fact that various industries continue to predict an even tougher outlook which could see subdued future performance.\n\"Currently, a number of investors are possibly evaluating their exposure to equities, but in reality, equities remain one of the best performing asset classes for long-term investors. The long-term view is essential because any ill-considered reaction to short-term share-price movements could lead to losing hard-earned gains,\" said Mr Enslin.\nAt 10.51am, the share had come down from its early rise and was up 2.45% to R72.30, valuing the company at about R24.7bn.\nIn the past year, Coronation has seen a 23% decline in its market cap.", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=CLM"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:04:07.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
