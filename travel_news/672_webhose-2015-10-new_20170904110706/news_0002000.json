Just one of 20 reasons your clients will love this friendly, funky place Romagna is a part of Italy that's really different.Not only will your clients love it (they always do!) But also they will come back from their experience telling all their friends about their new experience of this unspoiled, un-touristy and very hospitable destination.Just like the area's latest convert - hard-bitten New York and LA wine and food writer Janice Nieder (certainly not a pushover) who went so far as to say \"Romagna sure kicks Tuscany's Ass\" and wrote an incredibly enthusiastic article in the US Examiner about the destination calling it \"Europe's Best Kept Secret Holiday spot\" So if you're racking your brains to find a truly great authentic destination for clients that need a really great experience here are 20 reasons why they should experience the best of Romagna soon Just one reason - why not send them to a friendly Romagna festival? There's a food festival pretty much every week in a pretty village somewhere in Romagna from the massive Festartusiana to the seafood festivals on the coast to the Cherry Festival in pretty Longiano .And the spring and summer is dotted with performance festivals in lovely towns like the f estival of street theatre in lovely Santarcangelo and the amazing buskers festival in Pennabilli.Then of course there are the massive 1,000-year old festivals like the Bird Festival, the Cuckolds Festival and the Saints festivals. And, of course the wine festivals, the truffle festivals and the cheese festivals, and the olive oil festivals and the fish festivals.And then there are really big festivals like Christmas and Easter and Mayday and Midsummer. And walking festivals and cycling festivals, classic car festivals and motorbike festivals, and antique festivals, and music festivals - even barrel organ festivals . And more.The fact is that here are literally thousands of festivals every year in an area that is about as big as half of Belgium.They've obviously got a lot to celebrate. And, although there are very few tourists they love visitors and are past-masters at hospitality.So send your clients to Romagna and we'll make sure they celebrate with the locals - and they come back dancing and singing of the joys of this warm and happy place.Never heard of Romagna? It's the heart of Italy. Nestling between Venice and Florence, the Apennines and the Adriatic there are more glorious cities of art, more atmospheric hilltop castles, more sumptuous restaurants, more great food and wine and certainly more colourful festivals, than pretty much anywhere else in Italy - and an incredible lack of tourists too.Plus, maybe because there are fewer tourists there are lower prices and better value - than any touristy destination you could name.An example of how far the local restaurants will go to please you? It's the rule rather than the exception that even the smallest restaurant makes all its own pasta fresh every day. Old fashioned, but true in Romagna. Where else do you get hand-made pasta without paying a fortune nowadays?It's easy to find out more just email festivals@BestofRomagna.com More information about Romagna http://www.bestofromagna.com and at http://www.Facebook.com/BestofRomagna And there's more about this fabulous destination:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:03:49.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
