Days, weeks, and months stretching off into the distance without a care in the world aside from where you’re going to eat your next meal and which beach to go to. \nDon’t get me wrong, backpacking across new continents and foreign lands is incredible. But towards the end of your trip, you know the very best things have to come to an end. Those 6 months spent traveling through South East Asia will invariably lead to 6 months back at home with little money, trying to find a job. There’s a good chance of ending up back at your old career, sitting on Facebook staring at traveling pictures and reliving those experiences. \nThat is the reason I believe working abroad is the answer. Rather than travel through those foreign countries, why not live there? Be immersed into their culture, eat their food day-in-day-out (and learn how to use chop-sticks), create an amazing network of friends (both locals and expats), and know that you’re being paid to do it. \nTeaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) is one of the most common ways that young professionals make that jump abroad. Few qualifications aside from a college degree are needed. You have job security, your housing is provided, and you have the opportunity to save money and travel throughout your time. I loved my time out in South Korea for those very reasons, but again, towards the end of my contract, I started to get the familiar feeling of ‘what the hell am I going to do with my life?’ \nThough being abroad will provide you with incredible personal growth, your experiences teaching aren’t going to help you find that life-altering position back at home. At best you’ll be able to transition to an entry level position that you probably would’ve been able to obtain had you never left the country. I’m sad to say that I have some intelligent, well educated friends, who have ended up living back at their parents houses competing for entry level positions with recent graduates. Traveling and working abroad rocks. Do it properly and it’ll change the rest of your life Click to Tweet \nWe believe that career relevant work experience abroad is the new trend for recent graduates and young professionals. Towards the end of your contract there’s no feeling of despair, only of how you can move forward from here. We think your forward momentum can take you in two directions: \n1) – You head back home with money in your pocket, a year’s worth of memories and an incredible resume to boot. You’ve worn multiple hats at your role, you’ve created marketing campaigns, spearheaded sales drives, or analyzed data that has helped change the focus of a business, while your peers back home have continued living for the weekend and hoping for that promotion. \n2) – Your eyes are opened to the international job market. There are opportunities available everywhere you look. Not every economy is still recovering from the recession. Do you continue working for your current startup, do you work remotely using your new experiences and international networking as a driver for business, or do you change country and find a new challenge? \nIn both of these cases, you’re now in control of your life. You made that jump that few others would and now you’re reaping the benefits. Sit in interviews knowing that you have more professional and worldly experience than any candidate in that room. \nTraveling and working abroad rocks. Do it properly and it’ll change the rest of your life. About the Author: \nMatt has spent the last 7 years backpacking, teaching ESL, living, and working abroad.
