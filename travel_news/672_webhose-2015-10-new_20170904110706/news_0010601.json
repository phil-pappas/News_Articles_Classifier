Elingburg \nSpecial to The Post and Courier Oct 1 2015 2:00 pm \"Swamp Skyscraper\" by Zak Collins Photography is an art that appears deceptively simple. With the proliferation of digital devices, point-and-click images have revolutionized what once was a very specialized medium. But as any artist who specializes in it will tell you, there’s much more to lasting photography than just “point and click.” And that type of artistry and devotion to the form makes the photographs of Zak Collins something to be admired. \nIf you go \nWhat: “Impermanence: A Collection of Photographs” by Zak Collins \nWhen: On display through Oct. 12 \nWhere: The Art Mecca, 412 King St., Charleston Collins had a deep, profound experience that led him to take up photography, almost as a form of catharsis. (It’s too lengthy to recount here adequately, but I encourage you to read his artist’s bio for more details.) He’s self-taught in all the right ways and driven by a passion for his work. At the same time, he’s extremely aware of the medium’s duality. “The very nature of photography is at odds because you’re trying to capture a picture for eternity,” he says. “But even a picture won’t last forever. Even the photographic process for digital images isn’t going to last forever. And you take the emotion away whenever you look through a lens. As soon as you put a lens in front of something, you go into an automatic mode where you think about composition or subject and less about the experience.” His latest collection, “Impermanent: A Collection of Photographs,” contains multitudes. Within that single-word title there are several definitions, from natural elements of the environment that appear for only brief seconds, to the declining amount of pristine shoreline and wetlands around us, to brief flickers of light. “With impermanence, it’s about the fleeting moments of life that you can’t get back; things appear and they simply cease to be. It’s the transience of everything around us, the steady movement of life,” he says. But Collins’ photography isn’t overtly environmental, or even political. Instead, it’s a view from perspectives often forgotten or overlooked. Common sites such as the Ravenel bridge or Fort Moultrie, areas and tourist spots that locals often take for granted, are given a new look with Collins’ eye. Subjects as simple as a rope or car headlights are heightened by a subtlety that demands a second look. “I enjoy seeing the things you don’t really see everyday; the fogs, cloud formations, things that wash up on the shore from the tide that might get washed away on a moment’s notice,” Collins says. “Things are always changing on a daily basis and there’s a wealth of material around us.” Collins’ photography takes his locales and subjects and highlights them by focusing in on single elements within the frame, including the battle between light and dark. Where other photographs I’ve seen of Charleston tend to capture as much bustle and energy as the city holds, Collins lets the negative space speak volumes in his images. And it’s this artful framing that gives his photographs an allure and purity that is often overlooked by the naked eye. When asked if he ever thought about exploring other forms of art for catharsis, his resolve is sound: “It was always photography. Always.” Simply put, Collins is doing exactly what he is meant to be doing.
