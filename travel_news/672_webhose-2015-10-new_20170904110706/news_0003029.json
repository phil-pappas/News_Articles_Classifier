OTE’s northbound I-5 French Prairie Rest Area is used by nearly a half million motorists per month; many of whom are new to the area and are actively searching for information about local hotels, recreational sites, and restaurants. They now have a new, interactive means to explore their many options. \nIn 2015 Clackamas County tourism officials and OTE pioneered outdoor “new tech” at French Prairie. The idea was to transform an outdated and enclosed structure (built in the 1970s) into a bright, airy, and attractive information zone. The two agencies incorporated native Oregon materials such as fir and basalt into the remodeling project and created brochure racks and local business displays capable of withstanding Pacific Northwest rain and wind. Clackamas County installed a digital “concierge” that provides travelers with information on regional businesses and tourism activities. \nWould you like to display your business information in the kiosk? \nUse this link: opportunities for local businesses to explore your options at the French Prairie travel information kiosk. \nThe New Oregon Travel Experience Travel Information Center (Video produced and provided by Clackamas County.) \nIf you would like to visit the kiosk displays virtually, watch the short video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:14:32.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
