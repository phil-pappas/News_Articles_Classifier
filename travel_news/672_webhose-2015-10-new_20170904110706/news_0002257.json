ALBERTS New York Post Share Email a friend \nANDREW Alpern grew up just a few blocks from the Dakota. \n“I was always fascinated by the building, because when I was a kid, it was filthy dirty, as almost all buildings in New York were then,” the architectural historian said. \n“The Dakota was this dark, brooding, peculiar building that didn’t look like any other in the city.” \nDecades — and a soot-stripping cleaning — later, Alpern is paying tribute to the building with his new book, The Dakota: A History of the World’s Best-Known Apartment Building . \nIt’s only the second major book on the iconic structure, built in 1884 and designed by architect Henry Hardenbergh, the man behind the Plaza and the original Waldorf-Astoria. That’s surprising, considering how large the Dakota looms in the city’s imagination. \nCelebrities from Lauren Bacall to Leonard Bernstein have called it home. It was immortalised in the seminal horror movie Rosemary’s Baby , and, of course, John Lennon’s assassination at its gates 35 years ago has made the building a tourist Mecca to this day. (His widow, Yoko Ono, still lives on the seventh floor.) \nHere, a selection of the Dakota’s most storeyed secrets. \nAbout that name … \nNo, the Dakota didn’t get its name because the building was such a trek from the populated parts of Manhattan (“so far out it’s in the Dakotas,” goes the oft-repeated myth). \nThe building’s developer, lawyer Edward Clark, bought land on the then hilly, sparsely populated Upper West Side with plans to build the most luxurious apartment building the city had ever seen. \nIn a meeting of a neighbourhood group, the West End Association, in 1880 — eight months before construction started — Clark proposed that the area’s avenues be named “after such of the states as have well-sounding names”: Montana Place for what is now Central Park West, Wyoming Place for Columbus Avenue, Arizona Place for Broadway and Idaho Place for West End Avenue. \nNone of those ideas panned out, but at least he could control his building’s name. On the southern facade, near the roof, a carved panel depicts, presumably, a Dakota Indian. \nSelling the dream \nThere are approximately 100 apartments in the Dakota, with an average price of $US7.3 ($9.95) million, according to CityRealty. \nThe most expensive unit ever sold went for a whopping $37.5 million. In 2014, art collector Ydessa Hendeles bought the three-bedroom pad— with 30 metres of Central Park frontage — from hedge funder Bruce Barnes. \nThe very same apartment likely went for around $204,000 in 1971, according to papers procured by Scott Cardinal, a Dakota aficionado who has interviewed three dozen residents for a forthcoming documentary. Yep, it’s pretty fancy. Picture: Ken Grant \nThe building also contains former servants’ quarters — one-roomers that can only be traded between residents, who use them as guest rooms. In 2013, one sold for $103,000. \nThe building has evolved over the years, and more residents now skew toward financial pursuits than creative ones. \n“There used to be more camaraderie,” says Tony Victoria, who lived in the building from his birth in 1945, before moving out in 1992. \n“Friends invite me to the annual courtyard parties,” the antiques dealer adds. “My [former] next-door neighbour whispered, ‘I don’t know any of these people.’” \nLast month, Alpern attended one of the building’s famous parties. He recalls a lavish spread of catered food mixed in with potluck offerings — from filet mignon to a plate of sushi reportedly contributed by Yoko Ono. \nEven celebs make bad neighbours \nAmong the celebrities who’ve lived in the Dakota: John Madden, “Grey Gardens” filmmaker Albert Maysles, Connie Chung and Maury Povich, Boris Karloff, and Judy Garland. (Among those reportedly turned down by the co-op board: Cher, Billy Joel, Madonna and Judd Apatow.) John Lennon and Yoko Ono.

They “decided it would be wise to hold a seance to see what spirits might be inhabiting their new home.” (They contacted Jessie, but moved in nonetheless.) \nThen there was the late actor Lauren Bacall, who used Hollywood charm to cajole a Landmarks official into allowing her to install a verboten airconditioner.

She knocked down the wall between the living and dining rooms to make space for a grand piano, and installed a jacuzzi that could fit four. \n“There was a lot of fancy inlaid wood design, a lot of marble basins in the closets — all that had to go,” she told Birmingham. The author quotes film critic Rex Reed, a fellow resident, saying. \n“She won’t let me come to see her apartment. She says I’ll hate it.” Flack’s two-bedroom place is currently on the market for $13 million. Tellingly, the listing has no interior photos. \nPrincess Muna Faisal is another notable resident; she was married to Mohammed bin Faisal, son of King Faisal, who ruled Saudi Arabia from 1964 to 1975. \nWrites Birmingham, “When King Faisal was visiting the United States, the story goes, there was no time on his schedule for a personal [visit to see] his son and daughter-in-law, but the king was driven past the Dakota. ‘Ah,’ he said. ‘I see that my son has bought a castle.’” Lauren Bacall's Dakota apartment.

The two shared a studio on the Dakota’s ninth floor. \n“The best thing was when you walk out of the building, and you’re right there in Central Park,” Tamang tells The Post . \nAfter his employer died in 2002, Tamang worked for Charles’ actor sister, Ruth. Following her death seven years later, she left both her three-bedroom apartment and Charles’ former studio — as well as her art collection — not to her daughter or two grandchildren, but to Tamang. \nRuth’s estate was estimated at the time to be worth $11.45 million. (The notoriously strict co-op board can’t dictate to whom residents bequeath apartments.) \nTamang said that he couldn’t hack $5,450 in monthly maintenance fees, plus inheritance taxes, for Ruth’s old place, so he sold it for $5.4 million. But he hasn’t yet paid off the mortgage on his townhouse in Woodside, Queens, where he resides with his wife and 15-year-old daughter. \nNow 62 and retired, Tamang stays busy fundraising for Nepalese charities and trying business ventures, like a coffee shop that went bust in 2015 after two years in business. \nHe still owns Charles’ studio, where he stores the Fords’ possessions. An amateur photographer, he was encouraged by Charles to shoot celebrities they met at venues like Studio 54. “He would point out someone, and I would take a photograph,” Tamang recalls. “I was too shy to ask people.” His collection, part of which is kept at the Dakota, includes snaps of Brooke Shields, Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns. \n“Maybe I will have a big exhibition or a book,” says Tamang. “[My inheritance] is going to run out someway.” \nNYC’s early elevators \nFor its debut in 1884, developer Clark and architect Hardenbergh kitted out the Dakota with technology that was cutting-edge for the area, including electricity. \nIt was one of the first residential building to have elevators — operated by ladies in black dresses with white lace trim until well into the 20th century. An opulent communal dining room served pineapple pudding and pheasant. \nThese niceties attracted early tenants like the piano-making Steinway family and music publisher Gustav Schirmer. To be sure, there were also oddballs in residence — like Miss Leo, a nonagenarian recluse who lived on the ground floor. \nStephen Birmingham explains that her extensive collection of armour and taxidermy included a tableau with a metal-clad faux soldier astride a stuffed horse, fully visible through the street-level windows. \nSaved by the 1 per cent \nIn 1961, the Dakota went from rentals to co-ops. But two of the building’s most popular long-time residents, Henry and Winifred Blanchard, couldn’t afford to buy their fifth-floor spread and were to be evicted. \nAccording to Birmingham, each Christmas, carollers in the courtyard would decamp to the Blanchards for “hot buttered rum, cookies and sandwiches.” Neighbour John de Cuevas, whose grandfather was oil baron John D. Rockefeller Sr., agreed to buy the Blanchards’ apartment for $35,800 and allow the couple to stay on. \nAfter Henry’s death, Winifred continued to live there until her death in 1988. \n“There was no agenda other than generosity. He didn’t do it as an investment,” says de Cuevas’ broker, John Burger of real estate firm Brown Harris Stevens. Still, the good-Samaritan gesture paid off two years later when de Cuevas sold the place for $1.3 million. \nThis story originally appeared on the NYPost .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:58:25.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
