To celebrate the occasion, a reception will be 5-7 p.m. Friday at the City Gallery at Waterfront Park, where Olah will display new works in an exhibit titled “Finding Harbor.” Olah spoke with the Charleston Scene about the award and her background as a local artist. Q: How long have you been an artist in Charleston? A: I moved to Charleston in 2003 with a station wagon full of fabric, art supplies, a cat and a surfboard. Prequel to that day: I grew up in Lititz, Pennsylvania, a tiny historic town in Amish and Mennonite quilting country. I learned to appreciate quilts and began sewing and collecting fabric as a young girl. I went to art school in Baltimore (Maryland Institute College of Art) where I studied painting, printmaking and fiber art. The day after graduation in 1999, I moved to New York City and began working in fashion. I worked with designers Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs and Ralph Lauren, and dyed many of the dresses that went down the runways. By 2003, I was tired of snow, ready for a change, and had heard Charleston had a vibrant art community. I settled in and started a new series that was a cross between quilting and abstract painting with a nod to the historic and architectural details around Charleston. Q: What’s your signature style? A: I’m known for using fabric in my paintings. I abstract the coastal landscape into stacked water, layers of sky and stripes of turquoises, blues, foamy greens and marsh-grass golds. Some of the layers are paint, some are fabric. ... From a distance, the painting has a depth in color and texture. Up close, you can see the hand-dyed cotton, linen, and silk. Q: Can you tell us a little bit about your upcoming art show and the themes it explores? A: “Finding Harbor” is a new collection of 60 paintings that show views of our local marshes, beaches and the harbor. Some of the paintings are displayed in groups of two or three to form a panoramic view. I work from photographs that I take while on family walks, days at the beach and even views from favorite playgrounds (I have two toddler daughters). Spending time near or on the water has a positive effect on my mood and health. I’m soaking in the inspiring views of the Lowcountry and excited to share my own twist on landscape painting. Q: What’s it like for you to be the recipient of the Coastal Community Foundation’s Griffith-Reyburn Lowcountry Artist of the Year? A: Being an artist can be a strange and difficult career choice. With support from my collectors and art family and this super-generous award, I know that I’m on the right track. And being validated for something I love to do is the best feeling. I’m thankful for Coastal Community Foundation and Mr. Griffith/Ms. Reyburn’s insight to establish the award. An art prize is a rare thing, and I’m truly humbled and honored to have earned this one.
