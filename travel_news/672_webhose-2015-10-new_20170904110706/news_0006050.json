(ALPA), today approved a new contract agreement with FedEx management. The new agreement provides across-the-board increases to hourly pay rates and new-hire compensation, a significant signing bonus, retirement plan enhancements, work-rule improvements, and other positive modifications. \n“With the ballot to approve or reject the agreement open for nearly a month, our pilots did their due diligence to analyze and evaluate this agreement. In the end, the majority felt we achieved an agreement that brings improvements and recognizes our contribution to the success of FedEx,” said MEC Chairman Captain Chuck Dyer. \n“The drive to this agreement was led by our Negotiating Committee, chaired by Captain Scott Larsen, and backed by ALPA’s professional staff, subject-matter experts, and our elected representatives. We worked closely with the National Mediation Board and FedEx management to achieve an agreement that was acceptable to all parties involved,” added Dyer. \nThe new agreement will go into effect November 2015 and will become amendable in 2021.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:58:40.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
