Such semis are very suitable for mass production and innovative solutions in the form of compact and highly integrated parts that meet the high demands for performance, quality and cost efficient manufacturability. Evolution of magnesium as engine block material by BMW, gaining acceptance of aluminum castings for many parts and innovative applications in the construction of space frame, axle parts and structural components are some of the major factors driving the Europe automotive parts die casting market in this region.\nThe European automotive industry is known world wide as the technically most advanced and innovative. Due to the sudden economic crisis and political pressures, reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emission has become the major agenda by the automobile manufacturers by focusing on manufacturing lightweight automobiles gaining traction. Specific solutions based on the intensive use of aluminum as modified or new alloys have been developed in specific to the automotive industry needs. The European industry, as a whole, has more than doubled the average amount of aluminum used in the passenger cars in the last 20 years. With just 50 kg of aluminum parts per passenger vehicle in 1990 to over 500 kg of it in the AUDI A8 model, the market for automotive parts die casting is on the rise in the region and is expected to maintain a steady growth for the coming 5 years.\nThe Europe market for automobile parts die-casting registered revenue of $1.49 billion in 2014 and is expected to touch $2.14 billion by 2020, with an estimated CAGR of 6.24% over the forecasted period. Increased automation in the die casting industry spiked the productivity and a parallel demand for the former, from the automotive industry is dragging the attention of automotive manufacturers towards highly durable die casting parts.\nRockman Industries, Castwel Auto parts Pvt. Ltd., Endurance Group, Dynacast, Sandhar technologies limited, Gibbs die casting group and Die casting solution GmbH are some of the key players in the market. The market is segmented based on the production process type, by raw material type, by application type and by geography type. In a nutshell, automobile makers are now focusing on collaborating with the part die casting manufacturers in order to produce fuel-efficient and lightweight automobiles.\nReport offers the following:\nThis report on Europe automotive parts die casting market, analyzes the current market trends in UK, Russia , France , Germany and Italy in detail.\nThis report offers the technical aspects and economic data of the market and its forecast to the next 5 years (2015-2020).\nIt also discusses the latest technologies in the automotive die casting materials and parts that are under development and in research pipeline.\nThis report provides the list of major players in the market and gives an in depth analyst perspective of what makes the products and strategies of these players stand out.\nIt also offers the detailed data of the major suppliers for the product and scope for a potential partnership.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3320479/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/europe-automotive-parts-die-casting-market---growth-trends-forecast-2015-2020-300158148.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR25912&Transmission_Id=201510121559PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR25912&DateId=20151012", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/europe-automotive-parts-die-casting-market---growth-trends-forecast-2015-2020-300158148.html", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3320479/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:59:11.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
