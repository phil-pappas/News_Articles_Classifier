(NYSE: SEAS) (the \"Company\") announced today that it will review its options in light of the California Coastal Commission's (the \"Commission\") approval of the Company's Blue World Project with certain conditions. Those conditions include prohibiting breeding or transporting the whales at the facility.\n\"While we appreciate the opportunity to present the Blue World Project to the Commission, and are pleased that the Commission recognizes the benefits of the planned expansion, we are disappointed with the conditions they have placed on their approval,\" said Joel Manby , President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \"Depriving these social animals of the natural and fundamental right to reproduce is inhumane and we do not support this condition.\"\nNamed the Blue World Project because of its size and scope, this first-of-its-kind killer whale environment is planned to have a total water volume of 10 million gallons, nearly double that of the existing facility.\nAbout SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.\nSeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.
