Here’s a sampling of sites in danger of disappearing:\n1. PAVLOPETRI // GREECE\n© Provided by Mental Floss Located in southern Greece, the fragile remains of this underwater city are being damaged by passing ships and pollution. Ceramics found there have allowed researchers to date its society back 5000 years.\n2. SPAC PRISON // ALBANIA\n© Provided by Mental Floss A deteriorating labor camp in Albania that sent many prisoners to their death working in copper mines, Spac had been host to human captivity as late as the 1990s; the Fund argues it should be restored as a way of remembering a time when Communism prevailed.\n3. THE GENERAL CEMETERY OF SANTIAGO // CHILE\n© Provided by Mental Floss An eloquently designed resting place located in Chile, this cemetery is home to more than two million graves. A series of earthquakes have undermined its foundation, and local officials are allegedly doing little to address the damage.\n4. SABU AND JADDI // SUDAN\n© Provided by Mental Floss Two rock art sites in Sudan have been subject to both vandals and natural erosion. Flood waters from newly erected dams threaten to destroy some of the Neolithic portraits before they can be properly studied.\n5. THE CHURCH OF SAO CRISTOVAO // PORTUGAL\n© Provided by Mental Floss Lisbon’s infamous 1755 earthquake reduced many buildings to rubble, but this opulent temple of worship remained standing. It now requires restoration in order to preserve its intricate woodwork, oil paintings, and other other features.\n6. THE ARCH OF JANUS // ROME, ITALY\n© Provided by Mental Floss The last quadrifrons (four-faced) arch from ancient Rome still standing has yet to be preserved, even though the rest of the Forum Boarium (once a livestock market) is being brought up to date.\n7. MOSELEY ROAD BATHS // BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND\n© Provided by Mental Floss The Edwardian architecture of this indoor pool house is still being enjoyed by current residents, but government cutbacks are threatening to close the area down permanently.\n8. PETRA // JORDAN\n© Provided by Mental Floss A city carved largely out of rock, Petra is irresistible to tourists. Unfortunately, uncontrolled foot traffic is one reason the area is in danger of crumbling. Flash floods and erosion are also taking their toll.\n9. THE BRUSSELS PALACE OF JUSTICE // BELGIUM\n© Provided by Mental Floss Built as a courthouse for a newly independent Belgium in the 19th century, this immense structure was derided as too extravagant when it was built, and later suffered when it was deemed too expensive to maintain. The sprawling, 250-plus-room building is now in desperate need of renovation.\n10. THE CHUG-CHUG GEOGLYPHS // CHILE\n© Provided by Mental Floss Located in Chile’s Atacama Desert, the geoglyphs (pictures made out of land surfaces) are thought to be more than 1000 years old. Some are over 30 meters in diameter and depict human figures hunting animals. The establishment of a park is needed to preserve, protect, and explain the amazing art for future generations.\nAll images courtesy of the World Monuments Fund\n ", "external_links": ["http://mentalfloss.com/", "https://www.wmf.org/press-release/2016-world-monuments-watch-includes-50-risk-cultural-heritage-sites-36-countries"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:20:58.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
