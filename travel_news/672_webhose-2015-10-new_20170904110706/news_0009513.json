The answer is that they’ve all been helped by the RSPCA. And what’s more, much of this would not have been possible without the generosity of those who remember the charity in their wills. These people’s gifts fund more than half of the RSPCA’s work. So they play a crucial role in enabling the charity to fulfil its vision that every animal should be respected and treated with compassion. That includes farm animals and wildlife, such as the 100 seal pups that were cared for by the RSPCA’s East Winch Wildlife Centre in Norfolk in 2014. They had been stranded by a tidal surge, and required hand feeding and constant supervision until they were ready to be returned to their natural habitat. In November 2014, the Daily Mirror Animal Hero Awards gave the Editor’s Choice Award to the staff at the RSPCA’s East Winch Wildlife Centre for their hard work and dedication. Although activities like this capture the public’s imagination, the RSPCA’s most high-profile work remains what it does to rescue, rehabilitate and rehome abused animals. Sometimes, a bit of TLC is all that’s needed to restore an abused animal to health That is what it did with Henry the springer spaniel, who received an Animal Hero Award last year in recognition of his dedication to his new owner. Henry had been badly mistreated when an RSPCA inspector found him. He was rescued, looked after by the charity’s vets and then rehomed. Profoundly deaf, he was eventually trained as a medical dog, and now lives with diabetes sufferer Julie Barrett, detecting when her blood glucose is low and attracting attention if she needs emergency assistance. Sometimes, a bit of TLC is all that’s needed to restore an abused animal to health. Take Puffin the shih-tzu as a case in point. He was dumped in Thamesmead, with fur so matted that he was unable to walk. The vet who treated Puffin had to sedate him in order to remove the hair and muck from around his paws, which had swollen to almost four times their usual size. Even so, Puffin’s personality shone through, as an RSPCA inspector remarked at the time. “He’s such a sweet-natured little thing,” she said after rescuing him, “despite all the pain he’s in.” Henry the hero: Henry the springer spaniel receives an Animal Hero Award last year in recognition of his dedication to his new owner Photo: Mirrorpix Talking of sweet natures, rescue animals don’t come much more adorable than Gizmo the foal. He was found by a roadside in Essex, too weak to stand and infested with lice and redworm. RSPCA inspectors took him to a local veterinary clinic where he was nurtured on the slow road to health. Like many animals rescued by the RSPCA, Gizmo’s life has since improved immeasurably. One of the vets who treated him, Carolyn Wyse, fell in love with him. As a result, she adopted him and keeps him at the clinic, where he’s now become something of a local celebrity. This speaks of the deep affinity that those who care for stricken animals develop with their patients. It’s the same for RSPCA Veterinary Officer David Mills, who says that a recent case involving a mistreated dog and her litter of puppies sticks in the mind. The RSPCA’s ambition is that every animal in England and Wales should be free from suffering “She was like a bag of bones,” he explains. “She’d obviously not been fed properly, but had carried on allowing her pups to suckle. There were ulcers all over her mouth from where she’d been licking the floor for moisture. It was hard, but our team brought her and her litter back from the brink, so they grew into happy, healthy dogs.” This is the charity’s raison d’etre, of course: ensuring that animals of every shape and size receive the care and attention they deserve. But it’s not only abused or stranded animals that it helps. By registering for the RSPCA Home for Life scheme, the charity finds homes for pets whose owners have passed away, thereby easing their worry about leaving them behind. One beneficiary of Home for Life is Toby the cat. He came into the RSPCA’s Blackberry Farm Animal Centre after his owner passed away, and was soon spotted by Roger Fellows and his wife, Susan. “We saw a picture of him in the local paper,” recalls Mr Fellows, “and thought he looked like just the right cat for us. We’ve always owned black toms, so Toby was exactly what we were after.” Toby’s is one of many happy stories to be found in the RSPCA’s records. They’re inspiring tales of animals who are given new life as a result of the RSPCA's activities. And without the people who give generously in support of the charity, none of them would have had the second chance they so richly deserve.
