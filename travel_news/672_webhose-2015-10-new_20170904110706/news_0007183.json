I had originally planned to take the airport metro, but now hear that metro hours are curtailed on November 11 because of the holiday. Will there be prepaid taxis readily available on the major holiday? A friend advises me to get off the train at the Delhi Cantt Station and take a taxi to save time. Do experts agree, and will there be prepaid taxis available at the Delhi Cantt Rail Station on that night? Forgive my ignorance; I have tried to research this issue online, without much result.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:29:21.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
