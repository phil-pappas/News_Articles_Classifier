Lines of cars are queuing to get into the market, as the al fresco restaurants - mixed in with the knick-knack selling stalls - start to fill up and soca music blares from every corner.\nOn finding a coveted spare seat at one of the heaving tables I asked for the standard plate of fish of your choice – battered shrimps in my case – with all the sides (macaroni, salad and plantain) and a cold beer.\nNot exactly the height of sophistication, but the simplicity seemed appropriate for the surroundings and the meal was hard to fault on its sheer tastiness.\nBest of all, my whole order including drinks cost just £10 all in.\n'Apparently Mount Gay rum is the oldest brand in the world and its popularity is still such in Barbados'\nBut while food was my trip’s main focus, it would have been something to a cultural travesty had I not taken the time to sample Barbados’s national drink – rum.\nSo like many others before me I signed up for the Mount Gay Rum tour.\nMy group of seven were met at the start of the 45-minute tour by our upbeat guide Dwayne who proceeded to show us where the rum is bottled on the same site and knowledgeably take us through its history.\nApparently, Mount Gay rum is the oldest brand in the world and its popularity is still such in Barbados that it is stocked at 1,800 outlets across the country.\nBasically Barbadians love rum - and after trying three different kinds from the cheaper ‘Eclipse’ variety to the more expensive ‘XO’, I felt rather partial to it myself.\nI even stuck around at the end for a ‘special’ cocktail of cranberry, fresh lime and rum, named somewhat dramatically ‘blood, sweat and tears' by the tour centre’s talented barman.\nNeedless to say, it slipped down very nicely and I left feeling considerably more relaxed than when I arrived.\nSo at the end of my Barbadian food and drink fest what had I learned?\nBarbados is a land of variety, which is not afraid to pull a few culinary surprises and is punching well above its weight for a small Caribbean island.\nMy advice if you do visit is eat, drink and be merry.\nTRAVEL FACTS: FOOD, RUM AND WINE FESTIVAL This November Barbados will be hosting its annual Food, Wine and Rum Festival from 19-22 November 2015.\nCobblers Cove Garden Suite room rate:\nLow Season: £360 per room per night\nHigh Season: £593 per room per night\nwww.cobblerscove.com\nCamelot Restaurant: www.cobblerscove.com/food/camelot-restaurant\nLonestar: www.thelonestar.com/restaurant.html\nMount Gay Rum Distillery, Signature Tour for £6, www.mountgayrum.com\nBradley’s Watersports Activities: www.cobblerscove.com/activities/watersports\nRead more: Best Caribbean Water Sports | Complimentary Lessons | Cobblers Cove, Barbados Mount Gay Rum The Lone Star – Boutique hotel and restaurant Barbados Best Barbados Restaurant | Camelot Restaurant | Cobblers Cove | Relais & Chateaux Cobblers Cove, Barbados", "external_links": ["http://www.thelonestar.com/restaurant.html", "http://www.cobblerscove.com/activities/watersports", "http://dailym.ai/1iVqO1M", "http://www.cobblerscove.com/", "http://www.cobblerscove.com/food/camelot-restaurant", "http://www.mountgayrum.com/"], "published": "2015-10-04T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T20:41:36.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
