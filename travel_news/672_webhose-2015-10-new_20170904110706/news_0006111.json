The island now boasts nine different 18-hole layouts and two 9-hole pitch and putt courses, which directly correlates to the region’s on-going popularity as a golf tourism destination.\n“Many of Tenerife’s courses are now recognised in numerous rankings and the 2015 edition of IGTM will provide further evidence that the region’s many golf courses and resorts, along with the year-round climate, are collectively creating one of Europe’s leading golf destinations.”\n \nPeter Grimster, IGTM Exhibition Manager, commented: “The decision to return to The Canary Islands and host the 2015 IGTM in Tenerife, reflects the crucial role tourism plays in the region, alongside its overall contribution to the wider Spanish economy.\n \n“For The Canary Islands to continue to experience growth in golf visitor numbers is a notable achievement and underlines how attractive the islands have now become to golf travellers from across Europe and beyond.”\n \nMaría Teresa Lorenzo, Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sports at the Regional Government has stated: “The Canary Islands have a clear advantage over other golf destinations: their great climate makes it possible to play 365 days a year.\n \n“This fact, together with our wide hotel offer have made us a perfect spot for golfers, with all the advantages of a destination which is part of the European Union and easily reachable from the main European cities.”\n \nAccording to the latest figures from Turespaña, golf accounted for more than 986,000 foreign tourists visiting Spain in 2014. Marta Blanco, General Director of Turespaña, commented: “Turespaña fully supports the celebration of key events within the golfing calendar and is looking forward to welcoming IGTM to Tenerife.\n \n“As a leading golf destination with many excellently equipped courses and hotels throughout the country, we aim to ensure Spain retains its position as a leading golf destination and for the Canary Islands to continue its upward trajectory regarding visitor numbers that it has seen since the 2005 edition of IGTM.”\n \nSource:- IGTM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:04:37.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
