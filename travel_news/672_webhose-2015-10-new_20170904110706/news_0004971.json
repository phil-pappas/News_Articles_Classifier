According to analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the average home in England and Wales cost a record 8.8 times the typical local salary in 2014. It’s not surprising many parents find themselves helping their offspring. Andrew Hagger, founder of the money information service MoneyComms , says it is important that both parties understand the arrangement. “The funds may be a gift or a loan, but if it’s the latter it’s worth agreeing how and when repayment should be made in writing,” he says. “It’s not meant to be legally binding, but both parties know where they stand and what’s expected.” Philip Pearson, independent financial adviser with P&P Invest in Southampton, says if that you gift the money there is no further obligation. It is important to try to have as large a deposit as possible “If you survive seven years, that gift reduces the value of your estate for inheritance tax purposes. But most young people buy a property with someone else and if the relationship breaks down the house might be sold and the parent might lose that money.” An alternative is to take a stake in the property, so you and your child own it as tenants in common. “Over time, parents can begin to reduce their stake in the property, and the amount by which they cut it becomes a gift in tax terms which may also qualify as a transfer that educes the value of your estate,” he says. But when the property is sold, any profit from the portion you own will be taxed as a capital gain. Lenders will generally seek confirmation that the money is a gift David Hollingworth, the head of communications at London and Country Mortgages, says it is important to try to have as large a deposit as possible because in recent years mortgage providers have offered products which are much more graduated in terms of cost depending on the size of the deposit – the smaller the deposit, the higher the interest rate. “Also, lenders will generally seek confirmation that the money for the deposit is a gift and not a loan,” he says. “Most would be uncomfortable with a loan as they like to see the buyer making a commitment, not effectively borrowing 100pc.” Some deals allow parents to lock cash in a separate savings account with the provider, which allows the child to borrow with a smaller deposit at better rates than typically available.
