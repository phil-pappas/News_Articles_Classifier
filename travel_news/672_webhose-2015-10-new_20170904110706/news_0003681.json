For 2016, Hyundai has again increased the appeal of its award-winning Azera premium sedan, offering new convenience driving technologies such as Smart Cruise Control with Stop/Start capability and Electronic Parking Brake to Limited models.\n2016 Azera Highlights\nDriving Convenience\n• Smart Cruise Control with Stop/Start capability added to Limited model\n• Electronic Parking Brake added to Limited model\nThe 2016 Azera represents an advanced approach to the traditional premium sedan segment by delivering a powerful yet efficient powertrain, modern design, and luxury features combined with Hyundai's consistently strong value proposition. Azera continues to offer customers the highest levels of luxury, performance, and efficiency, all brought together in an innovative design.\n2016 Hyundai Azera\nMSRP\nAzera\n3.3L V6\n$34,100\nAzera Limited\n3.3L V6\n$39,300\nAZERA MEETS THE MECHANICS OF FLIGHT\nAzera's Fluidic Sculpture design takes inspiration from the mechanics of flight. The exterior of the Azera is long, light and low. The unique, undulating beltline allows for a long, sleek roofline accented by the third window and wraparound LED taillights. A monoform side profile includes flowing lines into the rear quarter panel. The face is masculine, with a powerful, winged chrome grille and available HID headlamps that integrate precise details, coupled with LED fog lights on the Limited model. From the side, the stance is complemented by large-diameter multi-spoke alloy wheels (standard 18-inch and available 19-inch).\nThe elegant look continues inside where Hyundai has created an upscale ambiance, with a flow-through center stack and instrument panel that creates a dual-cockpit front passenger space. These flowing surfaces complement the exterior design and wrap around the driver and passengers. Also on the interior, illuminated door sill plates greet passengers as they enter the vehicle.\nACCOMMODATING INTERIOR WITH STANDARD LEATHER\nAzera offers luxurious appointments that rival the finest premium sedans. It offers a roomy cabin with more than 45 inches of legroom and 40 inches of headroom for front-seat passengers.\nHyundai focuses heavily on other interior details, such as an optional panoramic sunroof, which allows more natural light into the cabin, and 3D Carbon interior accents. Other available luxury equipment includes a power rear sunshade and manual rear side window shades. The side shades, not found on any other car in the Azera's segment, can be conveniently tucked away when not in use.\nGiven the functionality and design of the Azera, seat quality and comfort is of extreme importance to the feel of the car. Azera offers first-class seating for all passengers, offering leather seating as standard equipment with a 12-way power driver and eight-way front passenger seat. The driver's seat includes a seat cushion extension and an integrated memory system for the seat, steering wheel column and side mirrors, while Azera climate and seat temperature controls keep occupants in total comfort. Azera models include standard power-folding side mirrors.\nAzera also offers an innovative Hands-free Smart Trunk opener that automatically opens the trunk when the key is detected near the trunk for three seconds, for a convenient means of trunk access. Unlike some competitors, the Azera system opens by simply the presence of the key near the trunk, and does not require a kicking motion under the trunk by the driver. The system can be disabled whenever desired as well.\nFinally, Azera offers heated front and rear seats, dual automatic temperature control, second row air vents, and cooled glove box, all standard.\nBEST-IN-CLASS SPECIFIC OUTPUT\nWith the introduction of direct injection, Hyundai didn't have to increase the displacement of the V6 engine in the pursuit of more power. The sophisticated Lambda II 3.3-liter direct-injected V6 engine is the heart of the Azera. It produces best-in-class specific output of 88.8 horsepower per liter, while also boasting the smallest displacement V6 in its class. The engine's high-pressure direct injection system (over 2,200 psi), increases power and torque, while simultaneously reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The system eliminates the need for greater displacement, and increases the compression ratio from 10.4 to 11.5 in the pursuit of greater thermal efficiency and power output. The engine also features all-aluminum construction, four valves per cylinder, piston cooling jets, roller timing chain, CrN Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) coating on the top ring chamfer and Dual Continuously Variable Valve Timing (D-CVVT). A three-stage Variable Intake System (VIS) further broadens the engines power curve to improve the vehicle's off-the-line acceleration and passing performance. EPA-estimated fuel economy for the Azera is 20 mpg city / 29 mpg highway / 23 mpg combined (19/28/22 for Limited model).\n2016\nAzera\n2016\nMaxima\n2015\nAvalon\n2015\nLaCrosse\n2015\nTaurus\n2015\nES 350\n2016\nImpala\nLimited\nEngine\n3.3L V6\n3.5L V6\n3.5L V6\n3.6L V6\n3.5L V6\n3.5L V6\n3.6L V6\nHP\n293 @ 6400\n300 @ 6400\n268 @ 6200\n304 @ 6800\n288 @ 6500\n268 @ 6200\n300 @ 6500\nSpecific\nOutput\n(HP/liter)\n88.8\n85.7\n76.6\n84.4\n82.3\n76.6\n83.3\nTorque\n255 @ 5200\n261 @ 4400\n248 @ 4700\n264 @ 5300\n254 @ 4000\n248 @ 4700\n262 @ 5200\nEPA-estimated\nFuel Economy\n(City/Highway/\nCombined)\n20 / 29 / 23\n22 / 30 / 25\n21 / 31 / 24\n18 / 28 / 21\n19 / 29 / 23\n21 / 31 / 24\n18 / 30 / 22\nThe engine is mated to a Hyundai-developed six-speed automatic transmission with SHIFTRONIC ® manual control. This system offers smooth shifts and gear ratios that ideally suit engine torque delivery characteristics. The Azera powertrain also has an Active Eco mode, which modifies engine and transmission control for improved fuel economy.\nOVERALL DIMENSIONS\nThe Azera rides on a 112.0-inch wheelbase, with an overall length of 193.7 inches and width of 73.2 inches. These exterior dimensions optimally size Azera between the Sonata and Genesis models.\nBEST-IN-CLASS FRONT HEAD AND LEG ROOM\nAzera has best-in-class front head and leg room.\n2016\nAzera\n2016\nMaxima\n2015\nAvalon\n2015\nES350\n2016 Impala\nLimited\n2015\nLaCrosse\n2015\nTaurus\nFront\nHead\nRoom\n40.3\n39.4\n37.6\n37.5\n39.4\n38.0\n39.0\nFront\nLeg\nRoom\n45.5\n45.0\n42.1\n41.9\n42.3\n41.7\n41.9\nSTEERING AND SUSPENSION\nAzera is fitted with a MacPherson strut front suspension, coil springs and a 24mm front stabilizer bar. The multi-link independent rear suspension enables precise geometry for a premium ride while enhancing agility. The precision of the advanced front- and rear-suspension is maximized through Sachs Amplitude Selective Dampers (ASD), allowing tuning flexibility at smaller damper displacements for optimal small bump comfort.\nThe ASD-equipped suspension provides:\nImproved ride comfort with superior body and wheel control Increased driving comfort without compromised handling Optimized tire contact with the road surface Azera offers 245/45R18 tires on 18-inch alloy wheels, and for Limited models, 19-inch alloy wheels are fitted with 245/40R19 tires.\nADVANCED STANDARD SAFETY TECHNOLOGIES\nAzera features a number of advanced safety features. Blind Spot Detection (BSD) with Rear Cross-traffic Alert and Lane Change Assist is standard on all Azeras, helping to alert drivers of vehicles present in their mirror blind spots, or crossing behind the vehicle when backing up. Lane Change Assist measures the distance closing rate of a vehicle in an adjacent lane to help determine if changing lanes is safe and provides both audible and visual alerts in the respective side mirror to help the driver make safer lane changes.\nOn Limited models, Lane Departure Warning (LDW) helps alert drivers when they might depart their lane unintentionally without using their turn signal. In addition, Automatic High Beam Assist on Limited models automatically dims headlights toward oncoming traffic to help reduce high-beam glare for approaching drivers. Limited models offer Forward Collision Warning (FCW), which provides both audible and visual alerts to drivers of a potential forward collision, alerting the driver to apply braking to prevent or mitigate an imminent collision in the front of the vehicle.\nAzera includes a Vehicle Stability Management (VSM) system, which optimally manages ESC (Electronic Stability Control) and the Motor-Driven electric Power Steering (MDPS).\nVSM works to control two effects: first is the unwanted minor pull in one direction when the car accelerates or brakes on a split-mu surface (slippery on one side, dry pavement on the other). VSM detects this natural pull and applies steering input in the required direction to counter the pull by automatically providing counter-steering force. The second is the counter-weight effect that occurs during a sudden lane change or cornering maneuver: VSM counter steers in the opposite direction to help stop the back of the car from stepping out-of-line.\nThe Azera also features a state-of-the-art braking package. The package includes four-wheel disc brakes (12.6 inch front and 11.2 inch rear) and an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) including Brake Assist, which provides maximum braking force when a panic stop is detected, and Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), to automatically adjust the braking force to front and rear axles based on the vehicle's load conditions. In addition, Electronic Parking Brake with Automatic Vehicle Hold has been added to Azera Limited models for extra driving convenience.\nAzera features nine airbags including dual front, front and rear outboard seat-mounted side-impact, front and rear side curtain airbags and a driver's knee airbag. Additionally, Azera offers impressive passive safety features including a Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH) system for children's seats and three-point seatbelts for all positions.\nADVANCED CONNECTIVITY AND MULTIMEDIA FEATURES\nAzera comes standard with a three-month trial period of SiriusXM® Satellite Radio Real-time SiriusXM® Travel Link® three-month trial period, including traffic, weather, sports, stocks, fuel prices, even movie times, multi-cultural channels and recording capability Azera offers the clarity of digital HD Radio® Technology Pandora® and SoundHound® capability Standard Bluetooth® hands-free phone system and auxiliary iPod/USB inputs An eight-inch touch-screen navigation system with integrated backup camera is standard, as well as an Infinity 550-watt, Logic7® Surround Sound premium audio system with 14 speakers, including an eight-inch subwoofer and external amplifier.\nThe system display offers superior brightness and touch sensitivity, making touch-and-drag functions easy, while offering a split-screen mode that simultaneously displays navigation and music modes. This LCD screen will also display album cover art from appropriate media sources. The unit can be controlled via either eight-inch WVGA touchscreen or voice-activation by an overhead console-mounted microphone. The system features 8GB of flash memory and comes matched with a sound system that plays compact discs, accesses digital music files via Bluetooth streaming audio or allows driver and passengers to access their personal listening devices through the iPod/USB/auxiliary inputs. Bluetooth® audio wirelessly streams music from select mobile phones to the head unit.\nAzera comes standard with iPod®/USB and auxiliary input jacks, HD Radio® and Bluetooth® phone connectivity with phonebook transfer and voice-recognition. A SiriusXM® Satellite Radio interface is also integrated into the head unit and features channel logos and SiriusXM Data Services, such as Travel Link®, which includes traffic, sports, weather, stocks, fuel prices, and even movie times. SiriusXM Data Services and Travel Link are complimentary for a three-month trial period to new Azera owners. Further, SiriusXM® capabilities include recording on presets one through six, so switching to a preset station in the middle of your favorite song no longer means you have to miss something on your favorite channels. Rewind up to 22 minutes to listen to the full song or catch up on an important sports broadcast.\nAzera also supports Pandora® and SoundHound® applications as well as \"Eyes Free\" Siri® integration, which allows drivers to perform a variety of functions without taking their eyes off the road.
