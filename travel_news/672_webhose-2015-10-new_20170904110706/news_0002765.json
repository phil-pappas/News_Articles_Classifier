Just in time for the holidays, MapIsArt has added scarves and ties to its lineup of products on which beautiful, custom maps can be printed to create personalized women's and men's gifts. The web-based tool is easy to use and allows the customer to input an exact address, zoom in or out, crop the map and then view it as a tie or scarf before ordering. MapIsArt also allows the customer to choose from a curated selection of watercolor, vintage and mod maps including New York, Paris and Bermuda.\nBoth the scarves and ties are made from woven polyester that is specially made to look, feel and act just like silk and are sure to last a long time. Furthermore, they ship within three days via USPS Priority Mail from St. Louis, MO, making it easy to wrap up holiday shopping before the rush.\nThe team behind MapIsArt is passionate about maps and wants to encourage others to celebrate meaningful locations: a childhood home, a memorable vacation spot, a wedding location, or a place you can’t wait to visit.\n“Geography is the third most important factor in determining your personality,” says Trip Wolfskehl, owner of MapIsArt. “Place is directly tied into, and inseparable from, our identity. It’s the essence of our being.”\nMapIsArt, launched in 2014, helps customers create fun, functional, local map products that celebrate their meaningful places.\nVisit http://www.mapisart.com or call Trip Wolfskehl at 401-419-9021 for more information.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5tYXBpc2FydC5jb20="], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:15:45.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
