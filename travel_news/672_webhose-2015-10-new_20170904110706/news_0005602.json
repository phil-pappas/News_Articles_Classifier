During that period, Arnot gained extensive experience in the Sales and Distribution disciplines, serving as the Head of Online Distribution for Protea Hotels for the past 7 years. He has a Diploma in Hotel Management, Marketing, from City & Guilds.\nAccording to Neal Jones, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer for Marriott International Middle East & Africa, “The new role involves taking responsibility for Marriott’s overall global distribution strategy for the Middle East and Africa, with an emphasis on the B2B segments. This will entail developing close relationships with regional stakeholders, and working to transform and modernise the systems used by traditional and offline wholesalers, as well as identifying technology and operational opportunities and providing guidance and localised education.”\nThe appointment of a Protea Hotels insider to a senior Marriott International role reflects the deepening ties between the two businesses – particular skills identified in both organisations bolster the strength of the operations across the board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:21:29.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
