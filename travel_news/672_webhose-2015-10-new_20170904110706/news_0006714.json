(Photo: ©2015 Michel Verdure – www.verd) \nHAMBURG, Germany — It was a big day for Norwegian Cruise Line fans on Sunday as the company’s largest ship ever set sail with paying passengers for the first time. \nWith 16 public decks and room for more than 5,000 people, the 164,600-ton Norwegian Escape is the fifth biggest cruise vessel ever built, dwarfing all but a handful of Royal Caribbean ships. \nConstructed over the past 17 months at the Meyer Werft shipyard in Papenburg, Germany, Escape departed nearby Hamburg on a two-night voyage to Southampton, England. From Southampton, it’ll head across the Atlantic to Miami, where it will sail year-round to the Caribbean after a christening in the city to be headlined by American rapper Pitbull . \nAn expanded version of Norwegian’s recently unveiled Norwegian Getaway , Escape boasts one of the largest deck-top fun zones at sea with four major water slides; a restaurant-lined boardwalk; and a giant spa with a flurries-filled snow room . The vessel also offers Norwegian’s first dedicated nursery for young cruisers two and under; the first Margaritaville at sea; the largest ropes course at sea; a miniature golf course; a full-size basketball court; and a bocce ball court — another first for the line. USA TODAY A trend? New Norwegian cruise ship is the latest with a ‘snow room’ \nEscape also features a larger version of the line’s signature “ship-within-a-ship” luxury suite enclave, The Haven, with its own private pool, sun deck, restaurant and bar. \nWith the addition of Escape, Norwegian now has 14 vessels. \nUSA TODAY Cruise this week is getting exclusive access among U.S. media outlets to Norwegian Escape.
