We look forward to expanding our relationship with farmers in the province, and will work hard to establish G3 as the partner of choice in marketing their grain.\"\nThe 50,000 metric tonne facility will be located at Pier 26 in the Port of Hamilton , just off Queen Elizabeth Way . Grains and oilseeds will be loaded on to vessels for transport to G3's facilities on the St. Lawrence River. From there, they will be shipped onwards to export markets around the world.\n\"We recognize time is valuable for our farmer partners, which is why this facility has been designed to get trucks in and out as fast as any competing terminal in Ontario ,\" Gerrand added. \"Combined with G3's existing facilities in Trois-Rivières and Quebec City , and our strong marketing connections, we believe G3 will present a very competitive new option for Ontario farmers.\"\n\"The Port of Hamilton is one of Ontario's primary agricultural gateways, with agri-food tonnage exceeding 2 million tonnes in 2014. Direct access to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway system means the port is ideally located for agri-food exporters,\" said Hamilton Port Authority President & CEO Bruce Wood . \"The Port of Hamilton welcomes major investments such as this one and looks forward to continue our close working relationship with our partners at G3.\"\nConstruction on the facility is already underway and is slated for completion prior to the 2017 harvest.\nAbout G3 Canada Limited\nG3 Canada Limited, a newly formed agribusiness, is establishing a highly efficient coast-to-coast Canadian grain enterprise designed to provide a unique competitive alternative to farmers, and superior service to customers and stakeholders.
