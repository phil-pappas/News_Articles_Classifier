Back at Seven for the new drama 800 Words , Carter shares her favourite moments in travel.\nWhere’s your favourite place to holiday in Australia?\nBC: The Great Ocean Road in Victoria is one of my most special places. I’ve got so many wonderful childhood memories there and new memories with my husband and own children as well. I love its rugged coastline tempered with lovely people, hidden beaches and inlets, and the majesty of the Otway Ranges.\nThe Great Ocean Road remains a favourite Aussie destination for Bridie Carter. How about overseas?\nBC: Anywhere. I am a very willing traveller. Rome sits dearly in my heart though, anywhere in Europe really and there are still many places I am yet to explore.\nHave you been somewhere for work that wasn’t on your travel radar that turned out to be a fantastic destination?\n BC: South Australia for McLeod’s Daughters . I will never forget the sunrises and sunsets of SA. I did a fair bit of travelling and found the four-seasoned state to be incredibly beautiful.\nWhere was your first overseas holiday?\nBC: Bali with my dad, stepmum and two brothers when I was 14. Bali was not what it is today — dad took us to some very remote and untouched places. It was a magical holiday for me.\nWhat travel experience will stay with you always?\nBC: Meandering through the backstreets of Rome at night stumbling upon the Trevi Fountain — it was so beautiful, I cried. Sitting in a hut in a Fijian village, on the dirt floor, with polished cutlery and plates, the family having cooked me and my two very little boys fish that my son Otis had caught with them that morning. On a jet ski with my husband, seven months pregnant, in a bay in New Caledonia and getting the giggles. Jumping on the subway late at night in NYC to go downtown to visit my cousin and feeling the crazy freedom of New York. Many standout moments.\nThe Trevi Fountain in Rome. Best place you’ve ever stayed?\nBC: One of my favourite hotels is The Windsor Hotel in Melbourne. We’ve been staying there a long time now, always in the same rooms, the staff know my children’s names and we know their names too. I get hugged by the head waiter when we return to the restaurant. It feels like a home away from home in the most comfortable and luxurious way.\nWhat destinations are on your wish list and why?\nBC: Vietnam for the food, natural beauty, architecture and people. Italy for everything and anything that it is. We shot 800 Words in Auckland but I’d love to see more of New Zealand. I’ve always wanted to go to the Bay of Islands and Queenstown is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been so I’d like to go back.\n800 Words, 8.30pm Tuesday on Channel Seven.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/77d9b6f3df2e4881f21565fe26186639", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d7b1e0b99cebbbce4b0871a0414b0857?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4b9458384c1b39ce1dc00c1b392718ad", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9ad1be769b5eb94b37cc926dc2f58c42", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dc7a58158ef06303c3bbed972721916b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd791685ce3d0338dc4ef4d49b4803c3?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/fb509cbd13e5ff9c1c96fa2553068811", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1c99bb1f2999ff8678647339409be444", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-23T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:05:02.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
