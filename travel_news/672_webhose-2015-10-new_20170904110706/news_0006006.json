Embark on a Great British Drive » First you hear the people’s screams. Then, like the Red Arrows, there is a fleeting glimpse as they zoom high above the old slate quarry in close formation, before disappearing in a blur over the mountain top. Zip World Titan is North Wales’ latest attraction – and its most daring. Designed for four people at a time, each clad in harness, helmet and red jumpsuit, the two-hour zip-lining expedition starts with a minibus ride to the peak of 1,939ft Carnedd Cribau. Then, by whizzing down a three-section zip-wire more than a mile long, you hurtle back down to earth at 70mph, high over moor, mountain and a mine where, a century before, men toiled deep underground, producing the fine grey slate for which Wales is famous. The “flight” adds a thrilling dimension to this Great British Drive, during which you will skirt – and then scale – mighty Snowdon itself, allowing you to become part of the scenery rather than merely looking at it, or capturing it on film. There is plenty to point your camera at on your first stop, after checking into your suite at one of the Grade II listed cottages in Portmeirion, a fantasy village created by architect Sir Clough Williams-Ellis in 1925. It’s magical by day, but as night falls and the day-trippers melt away, it’s spellbinding. Guests can wander the gardens and squares in shady tranquillity, stroll to the beach to watch the sun set over the Observatory, then enjoy dinner in the hotel by the water’s edge. At Bounce Below you can hurl yourself from giant trampolines into a web of walkways, tunnels and slides Check out before the tourists return, turn left and soak up the dramatic views of Snowdonia to the right. Drive through pretty Porthmadog, then follow signs through Tremadog before turning right to enjoy the back road charm of the winding B4410, through pretty Rhyd. If you’re lucky you will spot the Ffestiniog Railway steam train running alongside the road. Now turn left on to the A487 by the Oakeley Arms and left again on to the A486 towards Blaenau Ffestiniog: watch for brown tourist signs to the Llechwedd Slate Caverns – and follow those screams. After your two-hour, £50 Zip World Titan flight, sample tasty Welsh rarebit at the Caverns Café while enjoying the lyrical, lilting strains of the local language; you may find you are the only one speaking English. Menus, signs and announcements are in Welsh, too. However, there are always translations for out-of-towners who are unfailingly made welcome. Now venture below ground for more thrills. Zip World Caverns is the echoing, subterranean equivalent of Titan, where, in the gloom, you can try the world’s largest fully underground “zip line and adventure course”, in disused slate caverns. At neighbouring Bounce Below you can hurl yourself from giant trampolines into a web of walkways, tunnels and slides. To discover how previous generations fared below ground, take a tour of the dark, dank Victorian slate caverns, where men and boys from the age of 12 toiled for 12 hours a day under threat from rock falls and silicosis, giving them an average life expectancy of 40 to 45 years. To discover how previous generations fared below ground, take a tour of the dark, dank Victorian slate caverns Miners had to be at their workplace – 1,800ft below ground – by 6am for 12-hour shifts, often after a two-hour walk to get there, and with a two-hour walk home. Watch a slate-splitting demonstration, buy some slate in the gift shop (in the form of table mats, bottle racks and nameplates), then follow the A470 south through Blaenau Ffestiniog and Ffestiniog, turning left on to the B4391/B4407. The landscape becomes increasingly rugged, and more bewitching, as you climb from the village – more of a match for the lusty 262-horsepower, three-litre V6 diesel of Porsche’s superb Cayenne, with four-wheel drive, eight-speed Tiptonic S gearbox, adjustable suspension, Michelin Latitude Sport 3 tyres – and a top speed of 137mph. The car’s poise, luxurious comfort and delightful steering justify its £49,902 price tag. The 16th-century Black Boy Inn in Caernarfon, Wales The scenery softens as you approach Betws-y-Coed on the A5 (pausing for the view by the bridge at Ysbyty Ifan) to unwind at the splendid, Victorian Craig-y-Dderwen hotel on the banks of the River Conwy. Next morning drive through busy Betws-y-Coed – a walker’s paradise peppered with outdoor clothing shops and tea rooms – following the A5 to Swallow Falls on your right. Put £1.50 into the turnstile and be rewarded with exhilarating views of the waterfalls. Take the little Snowdon Mountain Railway train, which affords gripping views on all sides Turn left on to the A4086 to admire pretty, secluded, 13th-century St Julitta’s Church in Capel Curig, with the gravestones of local residents and mountain accident victims for company. Pause to take photographs of Mount Snowdon in the distance next to the waters of Llynnau Mymbyr and from the Llanberis Pass; the views are astonishing. The stout of heart will now tackle the gruelling walk to the top. Others will take the fetching little Snowdon Mountain Railway train, which affords gripping views on all sides. Enjoy an oggie – Welsh pastie – in the café at the top, climb the few steps to the summit for a picture then let the train carry you back. It’s just 20 minutes’ drive to macho, muscle-bound Caernarfon Castle standing defiantly at the mouth of the River Seiont. Scale the ramparts and gaze back to Snowdon or across the harbour. Stroll to the nearby 16th-century Black Boy Inn, check into your room in time for dinner, then head for the buzzing, picturesque streets with the locals, wander around the castle walls, along the harbour and on to Castle Square in the twilight. Stand next to the statue of Lloyd George and look up at the castle, resplendent in its evening illuminations. Above and to your right is Queen’s Gate, where – after his 1969 investiture as Prince of Wales – Charles hailed the crowds. To your left, all of Snowdonia, truly the jewel in Wales’ crown. Portmeirion to Caernarfon: nuts and bolts Snaking around and through stunning Snowdonia, this 70-mile journey has it all: mountains, moors, coastline, pretty villages, steam trains, a castle, waterfalls, steep climbs and descents – and a smattering of Welsh. The best places to stay • Portmeirion ££ No wonder they give you a map when you check into this fantasy estate; there is a whole village to discover, with splendid estuary views and utter tranquillity, too (01766 770000; portmeirion-village.com ; doubles from £149 b&b). • Craig-y-Dderwen Riverside Hotel, Betws-y-Coed ££ Perched above the River Conwy in 16 acres, this elegant Victorian hotel has bedrooms with generous balconies and views (01690 710293; snowdoniahotel.com ; doubles from £120 b&b). • Black Boy Inn, Caernarvon £ Welsh welcomes don’t come much warmer than at this bustling, friendly, historic inn tucked away in the heart of the town, within the shadow of the fortified walls.
