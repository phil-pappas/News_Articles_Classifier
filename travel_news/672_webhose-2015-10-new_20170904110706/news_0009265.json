She is an extremely passionate, enthusiastic and dedicated colleague, capable of handling even the most challenging requests with a smile. She truly represents all Jumeirah Group’s hallmarks and is a valuable asset for Burj Al Arab Jumeirah.”\nThis is the fifth time a Burj Al Arab colleague has won the AICR award.
