Hosted Buyers are able to meet with Exhibitors through a dedicated and exclusive diary where they can organise your appointments prior to the show, plus numerous other benefits including flights, four to five star accommodation, social events, regional Victoria pre-touring options and access to the Hosted Buyer Lounge on the show floor.\nMelissa Casey, AIME Hosted Buyer Manager, Reed Travel Exhibitions, who is managing the application process, has crafted a package with key experiences for buyers to meet valuable contacts, build relationships and do business.\n“Having listened to feedback from previous years, we have adapted the Hosted Buyer program to ensure both buyers and suppliers get the maximum return on investment from their time commitment at AIME,” Ms Casey said.\n“Pre-touring has been re-introduced to the weekend prior to the event (20 – 21 February 2016), to save valuable time out of the office. And a new look welcome function, hosted by Melbourne Convention Bureau on Monday 22 February, will offer networking before AIME officially kicks off on Tuesday 23 February.”\nOther changes to the Hosted Buyer program offering extra value include a breakfast hosted by each buyer’s hotel and a new and exclusive education program. These will take place on the Monday prior to the show opening, while a lunch break on show days will provide a well-earned break where buyers can refuel and enjoy the show floor.\nSource: AIME.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:17:44.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
