Think Knight Rider, only with fewer shiny buttons and more Curly Wurly wrappers littering the interior. In fact, my car and I already have a dramatic (if short-lived) crime-fighting history. One sunny day several years ago as I drove past my local hospital, I noticed a police car parked outside the A and E department. And then, in what seemed to be magnificent slow motion, a bald-headed gentleman came barrelling across the forecourt, pursued by several sweating police officers. While I’d like to claim that what occurred next was the result of cool-headed mathematical calculation, the truth is I panicked. The bald-headed gentleman was heading straight for the road I was driving down and, whatever his crime, I was pretty clear that I didn’t want to be responsible for running him over. I really didn’t want blood on my hands. Or my bonnet. Being a responsible citizen, I pulled in just down the road, and hurried back to give my details Alas, as is often the case with the best-laid plans, when I braked to avoid hitting him, I set a new chain of events into motion. Instead of me hitting him, he hit me, running at full pelt into the side of the car. Had the whole thing been a Road Runner cartoon, he’d have come clean out the other side and kept running. Instead, he bounced off and as the car and I trundled forwards in shock, I saw him being handcuffed in the rear-view mirror. Obviously, being a responsible citizen, I pulled in just down the road, and hurried back to give my details. He was in a wheelchair by then (still handcuffed) and returning to A and E with a cut on his head. After the police had finished reading him the official stuff, we alleviated any awkwardness by reverting to British type at this point. I really didn’t want blood on my hands. Or my bonnet I apologised for the whole bouncing-off-the-car thing, and he apologised for dragging me into his problems. He and the police seemed to be on friendly terms, and there was an odd sense of “all’s well that ends well” about the whole thing. The police had seen exactly what happened so although they took my details, everyone was very clear that it really wasn’t my fault. Which was nice. Of course, when I recount this anecdote to friends and family, rather than a case of “wrong place, wrong time” it instead becomes a case of “the day I apprehended a suspected felon”. And my car had the battle scars (dents) to prove it. When the unpredictable happens, the AA is there to help.
