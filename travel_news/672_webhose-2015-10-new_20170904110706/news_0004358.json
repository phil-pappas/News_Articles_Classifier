GKN Driveline has been named as a finalist in the Automotive News 2016 PACE Awards for two leading-edge driveline technologies - the Twinster Torque Vectoring all-wheel drive (AWD) system on the Ford Focus RS and an all-new lightweight Constant Velocity Joint (CVJ) sideshaft system, which can shave over 4 kilograms off the weight of a vehicle, yet improve torque capacity.\nThe Ford Focus RS Twinster uses an innovative combination of new gearing ratios and control algorithms to dynamically vector torque to the rear wheels, helping Ford to create a car with unprecedented dynamics, feel and handling.\nTorque Vectoring is achieved by selectively over-speeding the rear wheels independently, fundamentally changing the way the car feels and handles. In curves, the Twinster makes the vehicle turn in more sharply, responding more immediately to the driver's inputs. In Ford's \"drift mode\", the AWD system delivers even more torque to the rear axle, delivering enough torque to the rear wheels for the RS to achieve a controlled \"drift\" through corners.\nGKN's new VL3 CVJ sideshaft system is third generation cross-groove technology that enables rear-wheel drive platforms to save more than 4kg of weight, yet deliver the refined driving experience expected of a premium vehicle through unsurpassed balance and reduced backlash. The CVJ increases torque capacity by up to 27 percent compared to predecessor technology, with no increase in packaging size.\nThe nominations follow GKN's successful PACE program in 2015. GKN won a PACE Award for its two-speed eAxle, in production on the BMW i8, in April of this year and was also nominated for its AWD disconnect system on the Jeep Renegade and Fiat 500X.\nPeter Moelgg, GKN Automotive President of Engineering said \"It is a fantastic achievement to have two PACE Award finalists for the second year in a row, and we hope to emulate the success we enjoyed with the two-speed eAxle on the BMW i8.\n\"The Twinster on the Ford Focus RS and the VL3 CVJ sideshaft system are two very different technologies that illustrate our ability to innovate every aspect of our systems, ensuring we deliver truly optimised, integrated driveline solutions for our customers,\" he said.\nThe 2016 Automotive News PACE Awards winners will be announced in April next year.\nABOUT GKN\nGKN plc is a global engineering group.
