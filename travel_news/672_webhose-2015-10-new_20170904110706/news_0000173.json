This event was a key part of IMEX America’s Smart Monday, powered by MPI, which took place in Las Vegas on October 12, 2015. \nThroughout this exclusive event, designed for association executives by IMEX together with education providers ASAE and ICCA, delegates acquired valuable education and networked with their peers from across the globe. \nThe first ICCA session was ‘What’s Your Story?’ presented by Betsy Bair of Penton Media, Lisa Astorga, CMP of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and Martin Sirk, CEO of ICCA. They explained how associations can make the most of the stories behind their events to win better support from destinations who are actively seeking to attract events that drive scientific endeavor, technology innovation and inward investment. \nGamification, the topical business buzzword, was central to the session by Willis Turner, CEO of Sales & Marketing Executives International Inc. and Shelly Alcorn, Principal of Alcorn Associates when they explained its potential role in helping associations to increase loyalty and engagement. \nDedicated Executive Track \nThere was a dedicated ASAE Executive Track which opened with ‘The Journey to Great Governance’, presented by Susan Robertson, CAE, Executive Vice President, ASAE and President of the ASAE Foundation. This highlighted best practice in how non-profit boards of directors can fulfil their roles in living up to public and stakeholder expectations. Amy Hissrich, VP Web Strategies & Communications at ASAE then showed how mobile technologies can be used to maximize results from meetings. \nAt the same time some of the delegates chose to find out how to increase non-due revenues in international markets from Faris Abouhamad of the International Advertising Association and Steen Jakobsen of Dubai Business Events. Simultaneously Katie Callahan-Giobbi of Mindingyourbusiness explained how to measure the attendee experience - and how different approaches can help to design a better meeting. \nThe program was acclaimed by the delegates. Thelma da Sousa of the Pacific Coast Oto Ophthalmological Society said: “This is third year I’ve been here because there is so much you can learn. The content and range of the sessions is superb. There are so many that I want to go to that I wish there was more time.” \nAndrea Juncos from MCI Group in Argentina commented: “The program covers all the challenges that associations are confronting. It’s reassuring to discover that others are facing similar issues and I’m finding interesting new solutions from the discussions and through networking with other delegates.” \n“The opportunities for networking are really valuable “ said Charlie Olentine, Executive Vice President of the US Poultry & Egg Association. “It’s a truly international meeting which helps me to gain a really broad perspective on the issues facing association executives and it has sparked new ideas.” \nAfter this full day of education options, many delegates continued to network over Cocktails and Canapés at Association Evening sponsored by SLS Las Vegas at the stunning ‘indoor-outdoor’ Foxtail Nightclub. They were joined by invited exhibitors who are members of the supporting industry associations – ICCA, ASAE, AIPC, IAEE, IACC, DMAI, PCMA and IAPCO. \nCarina Bauer, CEO of the IMEX Group says: “Association Focus and its sister event – Association Day in Frankfurt – are always well received by the association executive community. It gives them time and space in their busy schedules to learn with and from each other in a private environment and on topics which are very focused to their needs. Both the buyers and suppliers also very much enjoyed the ever popular Association Evening in its spectacular new setting.” \neTN is a media partner for IMEX America.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:10:24.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
