Hansen .\nSince the transaction to dispose of 26 hotels for a total sales price of $347.4 million was announced in June 2015 , the Company has completed $198.8 million of acquisitions and has an additional $109.0 million of acquisitions under contract.\nHotel Acquisitions\nThe Company acquired the 156-guestroom Hyatt House hotel located in Miami, Florida , for a total purchase price of $39.0 million and entered into a management agreement with Interstate Hotels & Resorts. The Company plans to spend approximately $4.8 million on capital improvements at the property in 2016, and estimates a capitalization rate, including planned capital expenditures, in the range of 8.0 percent to 8.5 percent based on management's current estimate of the hotel's 2017 net operating income. The Company currently estimates the hotel will contribute approximately $0.7 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") through the balance of 2015.\nLocated in the Waterford Corporate Park, and adjacent to the Miami International Airport, the Hyatt House is surrounded by several Fortune 500 companies including FedEx, Avaya, Caterpillar, Estee Lauder Companies, Hewlett-Packard, Hasbro and Proctor & Gamble, making this hotel a great addition to the Company's portfolio. Leisure demand is driven mainly through travelers utilizing the Miami International Airport.\nThe Company also acquired the 179-guestroom Courtyard by Marriott located in Atlanta ( Decatur ), Georgia , for a total purchase price of $44.0 million and entered into a management agreement with Interstate Hotels & Resorts. The Company plans to spend approximately $0.5 million on capital improvements in 2016, and estimates a capitalization rate, including planned capital expenditures, in the range of 8.0 percent to 8.5 percent based on management's current estimate of the hotel's 2016 net operating income.

The area's largest demand generators include AT&T, Emory University and Hospital, and ABC Studios. With a state of the art lobby, and fifteen thousand square feet of meeting space, the hotel is well-suited to accommodate a variety of meetings and events.\n\"We are excited about the unique opportunity to add this high-quality hotel to our portfolio. The Courtyard Decatur's expanded meeting, conference and catering space allows for a small group presence, while delivering the attractive margins we expect from the premium select-service segment,\" said Hansen.\nHotel Dispositions\nThe Company closed on the first tranche of the previously announced disposition of 26 hotels to affiliates of ARCH, which included 10 hotels containing 1,090 guestrooms, for a total sales price of $150.1 million .
