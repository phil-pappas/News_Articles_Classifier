French FAZSOI (Armed Forces of the South Indian Ocean) crew members scanned the Indian Ocean for the wreckage. Three boats are also at the search party's disposal, but local government sources stated that Navy units would only be mobilised if debris is found at sea. The Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing over the South China Sea on March 8 2014, with 239 passengers and crew on board, whilst flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport. In late July, 2015, a wing of a plane was found on Reunion Island, which Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak later confirmed to be part of the missing Boeing 777 aircraft. Since then search parties have been going out on a regular basis in an effort to find the rest of the wreckage.\nAugust 12th 2015 2 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/World/ Christoph Mueller, Malaysia Airlines' CEO at the airline's Kuala Lumpur headquarters\nRobyn Ironside News Corp Australia Network IT is nerve wracking enough having a boarding pass with the letters MH in front of the flight number without being seated next to the passenger from hell.\nMalaysia Airlines has had to deal with a lot in the past 18 months and at times during the trip from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney there was a sense the frazzled crew could not cope with any more.\nThe flight over to KL was relatively uneventful in comparison.\nA sudden shutdown of the In Flight Entertainment centre an hour before landing gave twitchy passengers a start — it’s not what you want on an airline with an aircraft still missing after all communications were lost.\nBut it was an otherwise unremarkable experience.\nReturning to Australia was much different thanks to the passenger across the aisle, in the front row of Business Class.\nBack in the day ...

He wasn’t happy with the reluctant drinks service and made it well known.\nHis displeasure was duly noted by crew who seemed to decide it was easier to ignore responsible service standards, even after his travelling companion announced to the entire cabin “I’ve never drunk so much in my life” followed by “I’ve never been so drunk”.\nWith her indisposed, the man amused himself making derogatory remakes about the flight attendant’s weight to the growing discomfort of other passengers.\nIn-training.
