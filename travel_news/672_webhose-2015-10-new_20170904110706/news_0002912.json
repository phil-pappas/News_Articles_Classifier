Seven members of the senior management team gathered together in the Artisan Room at the much-loved family attraction to create a unique flavour of ice cream to be served exclusively at the 4 star luxury resort. \nThe new 1000sq metre ice cream parlour has an extensive list of award-winning ice creams and sorbets with more than 50 delicious flavours to choose from, including unusual options such as Sticky Toffee Pudding, Cotton Candy and Liquorice and Blackcurrant, as well as the classic favourite Cheshire Plain, with gluten-free and dairy-free options also available. The Carden team chose an autumnal 'Plum and Stem Ginger' flavour during the Willa-Wonka style ice cream making session to reflect the number of plum trees growing on the 1000 acre Estate, and the delicious new flavour will be available to order at Carden Park from November in plenty of time to enjoy with festive puddings and desserts. The catering team will then look to create a series of bespoke seasonal flavours to serve in the Hotel. This deliciously tempting activity is now available as a group activity for team-building days as part of an corporate package at Carden Park. Away day participants are already spoiled for choice at the Hotel with a long list of team-building activities available on-site. Guests can take part in quad-biking, laser clay-shooting, mountain biking and there is even a KONG Aerial Ropes course. Later this Autumn the events team will be introducing a brand new activity called 'archery tag' ahead of half term that takes a 'paint-balling' style approach to the sport of archery. The luxury 4 star Hotel has recently completed the first phase of its £4million refurbishment programme with significant improvements made to the 196 bedrooms, public areas, golf courses and spa, with final work on conference facilities and hotel suites due for completion in Spring 2016. The team visit to The Ice Cream Farm is just the start of a series of shared events and activities that the Hotel and the popular family attraction will be working together on over the next 12 months, including discount offers, competitions and new overnight packages for family stays and corporate days. Both parties are keen to ensure that visitors heading to Cheshire can make the most of their stay in the county. Hamish Ferguson, General Manager of Carden Park Hotel, said: \"As a team we thoroughly enjoyed the chance to get together and create something really special at The Ice Cream Farm. We were so impressed by the fantastic new development and we will be singing the praises of this stand-out attraction to Hotel guests. Our events team are also really excited to be able to offer such a one-off experience that is so to unique to Cheshire, to delegates visiting the Hotel as part of a corporate package.\" Following The Ice Cream Farm's major redevelopment, the local attraction has drawn crowds of more than 250,000 in less than eight weeks. Visiting families have welcomed the news that the Ice Cream Farm remains free to enter, with certain areas of the site having a ‘pay as you play’ pricing structure, such as the Honeycomb Canyon which is believed to be Europe’s largest indoor sand and water play area, and Strawberry Falls Adventure Golf. The new attractions are set around a 1,000 sq metre ice cream parlour and the site is now considered to hold the largest purpose-built ice cream parlour in the world. Jonathan Fell, Director of The Ice Cream Farm, added: “At The Ice Cream Farm, we have always been extremely keen to support local businesses in anyway that we can. Carden Park offers a fantastic facility, right on our doorstep, so we are looking to work with them in a number of ways. The Artisan Room facility at The Ice Cream Farm provides a great alternative for team building days for any type of business, and on this occasion it has also added an exciting twist to their menu for the forthcoming seasons.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:26:05.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
