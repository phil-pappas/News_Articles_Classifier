Now, in the heart of it all and welcoming the world for the first time, is the new Four Seasons Hotel Seoul.\n“Seoul has emerged as one of the most exciting, inventive and inspiring cities in the world, and Four Seasons is right in the centre of the energy,” says General Manager Lubosh Barta, who oversees the 317-room hotel, an eclectic collection of seven unique restaurants and bars, a three-story spa and fitness complex, and more – all at one fabulous Four Seasons address.\nThe new building in the Korean capital’s Central Business District, designed by Heerim Architects & Planners, is also home to the city’s best choice of event venues ranging from elegant ballrooms to myriad private entertaining options. Opening his first shop in Korea within Four Seasons, celebrated Tokyo-based floral designer Nicolai Bergmann’s beautiful creations are on display throughout the Hotel, complemented by an expertly curated art collection in rooms and public spaces created by LTW Designworks.\nBe among the first to experience the newest Four Seasons: In celebration of its grand opening in Seoul, Four Seasons is extending a special Opening Offer, as well as a Bed and Breakfast package.\nThe Sensual Style of Four Seasons in Seoul\nFour Seasons Hotel Seoul invited some of today’s most creative minds into a world of possibility guided by an unwavering commitment to quality, and the result is truly extraordinary. Sensory delights abound from the finest textures and finishes to the carefully chosen music in each area of the Hotel and the signature scent created exclusively for Four Seasons by Lorenzo Villoresi Firenze.\nIn 317 rooms and suites, guests will find a private sanctuary for rest and relaxation. The new, fully customisable Four Seasons Bed is in every room, and thoughtful features include motorised window coverings that allow guests to instantly choose between complete darkness, veiled natural light or crystal-clear vistas across the city – including unobstructed views of Gyeongbok Palace and the landmark N Seoul Tower from selected suites.\nThe look is a modern reflection of Korean tradition, with light-filled spaces and every modern convenience at hand. More than 160 contemporary artworks feed the soul, while attentive Four Seasons staff ensure every need and want is met.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:53:01.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
