It has also expanded its digital programming, including a Städel app.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage The Art of Collecting: Frieze Projects Puts the Focus on Physical Space OCT. 13, 2015 The Art of Collecting: Website Gives Stage to New-Media Artists OCT. 13, 2015 The Art of Collecting: Giving Art a Role in Society OCT. 13, 2015 The Art of Collecting: Preserving a Finnish Design Masterpiece in France OCT. 13, 2015 The Art of Collecting: India’s Rich Tapestry OCT. 13, 2015 The Art of Collecting: How China Conquered the Dutch OCT. 13, 2015 Städel the collector was also eager to create an art academy. Today, the Städelschule accepts 150 students from around the world and counts among its graduates architects at the German firm that oversaw the museum’s expansion three years ago.\nPhoto “First Painting of the Wall,” 1977, by Rainer Fetting, part of the 1980s exhibition.

Twelve columns buttress the ceiling, much like a medieval cathedral.\nThe minimalist gallery space resembles a piazza, with side passages, an imposing staircase and a spacious, airy center. The ceiling of the new gallery, which is on the building’s lower floor, contains nearly 200 skylights, and a grassy rooftop offers an aerial view.\n“The ’80s: Figurative Painting in West Germany,” an exhibition on view until Oct. 18, features works by 27 artists, including Albert Oehlen, Salome, Ina Barfuss and Martin Kippenberger. It allows the museum to reflect on the pivotal decade in Germany that was bookended on the one hand by student revolts and on the other by the fall of the Berlin Wall and, eventually, a reunified Germany.\n“These artists were shooting stars then, and there was this subculture, and punk, and this complexity is mirrored in their paintings, which have a certain sex appeal,” said Martin Engler, head of the Städel’s contemporary art collection and curator of the 1980s exhibition.\nPhoto “Two Proletarian Women Inventors on their Way to the Inventor’s Congress,” 1984, by Martin Kippenberger. Credit Estate of Martin Kippenberger, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne Their rise, he noted, signaled the beginning of the art market hype of the time.\nMr. Engler also said that the paintings and artists from the 1980s were often overshadowed by the era’s fascination with the subculture. And he said it would not be easy, or even entirely correct, to categorize the artists, or even to group them together. “They are a heterogeneous group and the artists themselves didn’t want to be pigeonholed,” he said.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story What they did have in common, however, was a combustive mix of rebellion and success.\n“Their motifs are often sexually explicit, and they used ‘bad painting’ on purpose,” said Mr. Hollein. “All of these painters came out of a tradition of expressive painting in Germany at this crucial moment in contemporary art and popular culture, and they were trying to grasp this moment, and in doing so, they wanted to be aggressive and in-your-face.\n“So, you see rough gestures, a method of confronting, even attacking, the viewer. These paintings were meant to trigger mixed responses.”\nPhoto “The Third World Pushing Its Way to the Regulars Table,” 1981, by Werner Büttner.

Rainer Fetting’s dreary yet wistful “Erstes Mauerbild,” or “First Painting of the Wall,” is displayed here, as is G.L. Gabriel’s melancholy 1982 rendering of “Blick Nach Osten,” or “A View to the East.”\nThe artists who worked in Hamburg, such as Oehlen and Kippenberger, also responded to the national spirit of the times, but with a more sardonic edge. Kippenberger’s cheekily named “With the Best Will in the World, I Can’t See a Swastika” is among these, with its colors taken from the German flag, as is Werner Büttner’s regretful drunk in “Please Wake at 8:00 p.m.”\nArtists who worked in the district of Deutz in Cologne are billed as observers of the everyday art scene, but included among the works is a political prophesy: Jiri Georg Dokoupil’s “Red Star in Distress” from 1982.\n“These paintings still have the power they had thirty years ago,” Mr. Hollein said.„\nAt a time when Germany is seen by many as a fulcrum balancing several moving parts — not least the Greek financial crisis and the mounting pressure to address the influx of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa — the works echo a similar chaos and significance from an earlier time.\n“The exhibit is a bridge between the past to the present,” Mr. Engler said.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartasia-1/14iht-rartasia-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartstaedel-4/14iht-rartstaedel-4-blog427.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartstaedel-4/14iht-rartstaedel-4-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartindia-1/14iht-rartindia-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartstaedel-2/14iht-rartstaedel-2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartdaata-1/14iht-rartdaata-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartfrieze-1/14iht-rartfrieze-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartstaedel-5/14iht-rartstaedel-5-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartstaedel-5/14iht-rartstaedel-5-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartaalto-1/14iht-rartaalto-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartmennour/14iht-rartmennour-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/arts/14iht-rartstaedel-2/14iht-rartstaedel-2-blog427.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:54:15.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
