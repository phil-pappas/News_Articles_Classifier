In its latest innovation as the recognized world leader in pizza delivery, Domino's (NYSE: DPZ) is launching the Domino's DXP™ (Delivery Expert), a specially designed and built pizza delivery vehicle. The DXP is the combined brainchild of former GM R&D executive Kenneth R. Baker , Michigan -based Roush Enterprises and Domino's. To also include consumers' input, hundreds of concepts were initially identified in an online crowdsourcing design competition hosted by Local Motors.\n\"The Domino's DXP is the first purpose-built vehicle aimed at revolutionizing pizza delivery,\" said Russell Weiner , president of Domino's USA. \"This innovation allows drivers to do their jobs with greater ease and efficiency, and demonstrates that Domino's is absolutely fanatical about making perfect deliveries.\"\nThe Domino's DXP also represents a collaboration among three great Michigan brands: Domino's, Roush and General Motors. \"As a 55-year-old company born in Michigan , it is an honor to be able to partner with other great Michigan companies to produce the DXP,\" said Weiner.\nThe design and production of the Domino's DXP took over three years. It was born out of Domino's passion for innovation and started with a five-stage crowdsourcing competition hosted by Local Motors, on the company's open innovation platform called Open IO. The contest, called the Domino's Ultimate Delivery Vehicle Challenge, fielded 385 entries from designers around the world. Then, Roush and Baker adapted the concept and worked closely with Domino's to transform the Chevrolet Spark ® (with its international style, tech-savvy command deck and nimble maneuverability) into a delivery vehicle for pizza and other menu items – ensuring hot and great tasting pizzas delivered right to your door.\nDomino's is working with Roush Enterprises to convert and deliver 100 DXPs to 25 markets across the U.S., including major rollouts in Boston , Dallas , Detroit , Houston , Indianapolis , New Orleans , San Diego and Seattle over the next 90 days. Domino's has contracted with Chevrolet dealers in the cities where DXP vehicles are being launched to deal with the nuances of the DXP, from ovens to accessories. These dealers will also partner with franchisees to hold local launch events to introduce the DXP in select markets.\nPizza delivery represents roughly two-thirds of Domino's business and the DXP represents the latest innovation in this space. In the U.S. alone, Domino's delivers about 400 million pizzas a year and delivery drivers cover roughly 10 million miles each week – equivalent to 21 round trips to the moon. Over the years, Domino's has revolutionized pizza delivery with other innovations including the corrugated pizza box, Domino's Tracker ® , the Heatwave bag and ordering by text, Twitter and emoji.\nConsumers spotting DXP vehicles can share their sighting via social media using the hashtag #DXP. More information about the DXP can be found at www.dominosdxp.com , a site created by Domino's advertising agency CP+B, who were integral partners in the design and launch of the DXP.\nDXP Special Features and Fun Facts\nThe Domino's-branded illuminated warming oven located behind the driver's door and storage areas are designed for easy loading and unloading of pizzas and other menu items. The warming oven can hold two Heatwave™ bags and is quickly accessible to drivers with the touch of a key fob. The interior of the DXP includes both front and rear storage areas and features a non-slip, easy-to-clean surface to stabilize items during delivery. The car has been reconfigured with all but the driver's seat removed, allowing the DXP to hold large orders for schools, businesses and special events as well as home delivery. The DXP has the capacity to accommodate up to 80 pizzas, along with Domino's other menu items including salads, wings and 2-liter bottles of soda. The DXP comes equipped with a puddle light projecting the Domino's logo on the ground. The front fascia displays the Domino's logo, and the side panel displays the reflective graphic of the Domino's brand. Other details include hubcaps with the Domino's logo and the recognizable illuminated Domino's car topper. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) named the DXP's base vehicle, the Chevrolet Spark, a 2015 Top Safety Pick in its minicar segment. With an outstanding combination of the latest safety and technology features, drivers can feel confident with the DXP's protection in case of an emergency. To keep the DXP vehicles in top operating condition, Chevrolet dealers in the cities where DXP vehicles are being launched have been trained to service the DXPs. The DXP comes equipped with the OnStar® navigation system. The OnStar navigation system will help drivers stay on course with turn-by-turn directions and connections to 9-1-1 in case of emergency. With an EPA estimated 39 MPG highway, the DXP should provide the kind of fuel economy franchisees welcome. Its 1.2 liter engine makes the I-4 engine car fun to drive. With an EPA estimated 39 MPG highway, the DXP will provide the kind of economics franchisees welcome. The DXP features a continuous variable automatic transmission that adapts seamlessly to driver throttle input and speed for a comfortable ride.\n\"Even though Domino's deliveries will still primarily be made in the personal cars of delivery drivers,\" said Weiner, \"the Domino's DXP represents an innovative leap into the 21st century and takes delivery to a new level of efficiency and quality.\"\nAbout Domino's Pizza®\nFounded in 1960, Domino's Pizza is the recognized world leader in pizza delivery, with a significant business in carryout pizza.
