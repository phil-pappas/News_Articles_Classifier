(It’s about the wine, a 1996 Chateau Petrus, served with it.) Keller is as lovely to chat with as he is talented in the kitchen. \nOur meal started with creamy Truffled Onion Veloute shooters (the chef even gave us a signed recipe), followed by his signature HK Burger with choice of toppings — cheese, mushrooms, chipotle aioli, black truffles and foie gras. My Fleur Pom Mimosa (Absolut peach vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice, prosecco and pomegranate syrup) — was the perfect pairing. \nGuy Fieri’s Vegas Kitchen & Bar \nThe bleached-blonde host of various Food Network shows offers up everything from the vertically impressive Bacon Mac-N-Cheese Burger to The General’s Wings (with sweet and spicy sauce, sesame seeds and jalapenos) at his large gastro-pub in the LINQ Hotel and Casino. We followed up those entrees by sharing a Fried Ice Cream Boulder Sundae — kind of like a deep-fried banana split with peanut butter, caramel sauce, pineapple, raspberry and chocolate sauces — and barely made a dent in it. Delish! \nLago by Julian Serrano \nCheck out Sunday brunch at this elegant eatery specializing in “bold Italian small plates.” Located inside the Bellagio, diners can watch the resort’s famous fountains through large glass windows while noshing in this beautiful dining room full of natural light. The idea is to have a first and second course followed by dessert ($38) but we had to sample everything. Standout dishes included Mac Carbonara (pancetta, egg yolks, pecorino, black pepper), Quinoa Salad (grapefruit, dates, almonds, arugula, yogurt dressing) and Raviolone (egg yolk, truffle ricotta, summer truffle butter sauce) — my new “desert island” dish. \nHigh Roller experience \nAt the bottom of the LINQ promenade, the world’s tallest observation wheel — standing 167-metres-high — takes riders on a half-hour journey in slow motion. Each of the High Roller’s 28 glass-enclosed cabins holds up to 40 people and offers bar service, if you feel so inclined. \nKing of Vegas \nAnyone who loves The King will love Elvis: The Exhibition at Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino. The new exhibit outlines his life, career and early time in Las Vegas at the former International Hotel (now Westgate). Artifacts include clothes, records, jewelry, books, cars, a Harley, videos, films, and the King’s famous white jumpsuit as it evolved through the years. \nGrand Canadian deal \nThe Downtown Grand Hotel & Casino has rooms, suites and a rooftop infinity pool. Located at 206 N. 3rd St., the hotel is within walking distance of shops, the Arts District and other attractions. A current deal for Canadian visitors offers up to $500 US per day in slot play for Canadian money at par (maximum $.75 US per $1 Cdn.). The deal is available through year-end to Canadian casino visitors staying at the hotel. For full details, contact downtowngrand.com or 1-855-DT-GRAND.
