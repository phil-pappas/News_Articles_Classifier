MAD MEN Watch all 7 seasons with Sky Box Sets Photo: Mad Men © 2015 Frank Ockenfels/Lionsgate Food and drink are integral to Mad Men , the story of a Madison Avenue advertising agency in the Sixties. Sterling Cooper is always pitching for food accounts from Life Cereal to Howard Johnsons restaurants. But it is the food and drink consumed by the characters that is most memorable, whether it's Don Draper's omnipresent cocktail or the oyster-and-dry martini lunch gulped down by his pal Roger Sterling – which ends up so disastrously on the ad agency floor. Indeed, there is a colossal amount of drink consumed over the course of all seven seasons – with whisky probably being the tipple of choice by most characters. However, it’s the cocktails like dry martinis and vodka gimlets that are legendary, even more so when Don chose to teach his six-year-old daughter how to make a Tom Collins as part of her childhood education. That’s quite a life lesson for an American dad to give. But at least he didn’t teach her to smoke at the same time – every meal and every drink on Mad Men comes with an obligatory cigarette. So switch on your new-fangled color TV and settle down with one of Don Draper's signature Old Fashioneds. THE BLACKLIST Watch seasons 1 and 2 with Sky Box Sets Photo: The Blacklist © 2015 Sony Pictures Television Inc. All Rights Reserved. Raymond Reddington is such a cool dude and so sophisticated in every aspect of life that only the best would be good enough for him and, therefore, for anyone watching The Blacklist . For food, that would mean travelling the globe to find the most mouthwatering dishes – beluga caviar from Russia or a plate of Kashmiri chicken from India including rice cooked with saffron, the world’s most expensive herb. Wash that down with a glass of Château Lafite Rothschild or a tumbler of whiskey from the Macallan distillery – especially the 55-year-old single malt bottled in a Lalique crystal decanter. BONES Watch seasons 1 to 10 with Sky Box Sets Photo: BONES © 2005-2014 Fox and its related entities. All rights reserved. Series 1-8. The police procedural Bones might be full of dead bodies and callous killing, but it’s also a love story between the headstrong forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan and loveable FBI special agent Seeley Booth. So it’s the food of love that is needed to fully enjoy the show – classic aphrodisiacs such as fresh oysters and a few pieces of chocolate. But if you want your love delivered with something more unusual, add pomegranates (which contain lots of antioxidants and are therefore good for the heart) and bananas (the cheekier lovers would appreciate the shape). And you can’t have all these plates full of passion without some red wine to wash it all down. But make it French wine because, after all, France is the land of lovers, isn’t it? CRIMINAL MINDS Watch seasons 1 to 10 with Sky Box Sets Photo: Criminal Minds © ABC Studios. There are plenty of ways to use food and drink for criminal purposes – you might notice during Criminal Minds that it’s not a good idea to leave a drink unattended in a bar. So maybe any in-show consumption needs to be simple, like an ice-cold bottle of beer in a downtown bar, just the way so many characters enjoy a drink. Better make it an unusual brand from America, either an old-style Schlitz lager or a new-style Fat Tire amber ale. Something to eat? Then that beer would have to be accompanied with some typical bar food, perhaps a juicy burger with all the fixings or even a raw-cooked steak and fries with lots of ketchup – what else do you need to remind you of all the blood that’s spilled during the show? • Watch back-to-back episodes of Sky’s biggest TV shows like these and more with Sky Box Sets.
