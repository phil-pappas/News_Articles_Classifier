The newly-minted word is at the heart of a new Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) ad campaign from the GSD&M ad agency in Austin, Texas, that starts today. New TV commercials, print, and digital components in the massive advertising push will talk about a theme that has long been tied to Southwest — its transparent ticket pricing structure. Enlarge Transfarency is at the heart of a new Southwest Airlines ad campaign from GSD&M in… more In the new ads, Southwest, which has its largest hub at Chicago's Midway Airport, once more will drive home how it is different from competing airlines and their menus of add-on fees. Southwest insists it is different because it has no ticket change fees, hidden fees, or unexpected bag fees. So Southwest and GSD&M have coined the word \"transfarency\" as the theme of the airline's new ad campaign. The new ads also suggest Southwest is the airline that treats its customers \"honestly and fairly.\" The launch TV spot, which begins airing tonight during the Major League Baseball playoff telecasts, and, Sunday, during National Football League game telecasts, gets right to the overarching point of the campaign right at the top when the voiceover announcer asks \"when did paying for airfare become so unfair?\" The first TV spot continues by pointing out that Southwest does things differently, which is why the carrier and its ad agency are introducing the word \"transfarency\" and rolling out a campaign to promote it. The spot also insists its policy of \"transfarency\" shows Southwest's respect for its passengers. The first spot ends by underscoring that particular point with the line \"we don't just fly you, we like you.\" If nothing else, Southwest's new ad campaign indicates the carrier is prepared to wage fierce battle with competitors such as United Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines on the issue of fares and the add-on fees that generate billions of dollars in added revenue for those competitors. Just to make sure competing airlines and consumers get the point, Southwest also is launching a new microsite at transfarency.com , where visitors can see exactly what kind of add-on fees may be part of fares at other airlines. Noted Kevin Krone, Southwest's vice president and chief marketing officer: \"Being a low-fare airline is at the heart of our brand, and the foundation of our business model, so we're not going to nickel and dime our customers.\" The launch of the new ad campaign comes one day after it was revealed Southwest had the best on-time arrival performance of all major domestic carriers during September. The new ad campaign will run nationally for the next 15 weeks.
