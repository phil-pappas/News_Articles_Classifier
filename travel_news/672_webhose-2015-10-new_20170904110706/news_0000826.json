In 2015, approximately 50 percent (453 franchises) of CruiseOne’s franchise owners participated with the highest ratings to date.\n“These survey results are testament to the personalized level of support our employees at corporate headquarters provide to each and every franchisee,” said Debbie Fiorino, senior vice president of CruiseOne. “I am so proud of my team in how they fulfill our company mission of delivering a remarkable experience for our customers — the franchisees.”\nFranchise Business Review is an independent national market research firm focused on franchisee satisfaction and performance. The company sent one survey to each CruiseOne franchise in business for at least six months and asked 33 benchmark questions in the areas of financial opportunity, training and support, leadership, operations and product development, core values, general satisfaction and the franchisee community. An additional 16 questions asked franchisees about their market area, demographics, business lifestyle, overall enjoyment running their franchise and role in the franchisee community.\nWith an average score of 71.4 percent, CruiseOne exceeded the Travel & Hospitality Industry average by more than three percentage points in all eight categories. Franchisees were most satisfied with CruiseOne’s Core Values (83.8 percent compared to an industry average of 79.4 percent), while the largest satisfaction differentiation was in the Corporate Support category (72.1 percent compared to an industry average of 61.1 percent).\n“Our belief in transparency and having open and honest communications with our franchisees and prospects is why we share our results with our network, and choose to have our survey results available online,” added Fiorino. “Based on the feedback we receive, we follow up with franchisees and determine how to use these results to shape our future strategy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:27:58.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
