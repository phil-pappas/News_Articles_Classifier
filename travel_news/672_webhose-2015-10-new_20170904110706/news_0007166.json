Getting away can instead be used as time to take it easy, enjoy your surroundings, watch the sunset and, y'know, chill. If you are looking for seaside serenity, two Bandara properties on Phuket's Ao-Yon bay will do the trick. Bandara Resort, Phuket consists of two properties -- Bandara Villas, Phuket and Bandara Beach, Phuket -- each a short walk from the other. \nCouples seeking a luxurious and sexy retreat should consider Bandara Villas, where four accommodation types are available. The 33 villas range from a 60m² Panoramic Pool Villa to the two-bedroom Ao-Yon Pool Villa, which is 240m². All villas are perched on a hillside, overlooking the long and beautiful beach, the turquoise sea and nearby islands. Each comes with a private infinity-edge pool. \nBandara Villas also has a sandy beach guests can truly enjoy. You can either walk downstairs to the beach or use a tram service that travels back and forth until late at night. Avoid booking a villa next to the tram line, though, if you want total privacy. We accidentally caught a guy eating instant noodles in his pool during one of our tram rides. \nTo match the upscale accommodation, creative fusion dishes are served at Sumpao restaurant. Chef Gun, who also runs Alice's Pizza in Bangkok, was recently appointed senior executive chef there. He's the kind of guy to put water mimosa on pizza -- and make it work. His Seafood paella using Thai rice is also delicious. A seafood barbecue buffet is held every Friday, for B899 per person. Enjoy a nightcap or two at the restaurant's bar or sip wine beneath the stars in your private pool. To shed a few calories, join a muay Thai boxing class on the front lawn, do water aerobics in the common pool or kayak in the sea. All activities, which instructors guide guests through, are free of charge. \nFor more economical stays, consider Bandara Beach, which offers 116 rooms in two hillside buildings. Two room types are available -- 23m² Deluxe and 29m² Deluxe Balcony. The beach is located a short walk away. Try to get a room on the top floor of the building closest to the beach so you can enjoy a full sea view from your balcony. Stay lower and your view is likely to be obstructed by nearby houses. You can always go up to the rooftop swimming pool to truly enjoy the breathtaking bay view, along with a meal from the Andaman Bar. Rise restaurant serves a basic breakfast buffet from 6:30-10:30am. \nDeluxe Room Bandara Beach \nRestaurants, a sailing school and a massage parlour can be found along the beach and the road which both hotels are on. Unfortunately, the shuttle service and spa yet open. Taxi vans and motorcycles for rent can be found near both hotels, should you want to visit the louder parts of Phuket. All in all, both properties are very good options for those who truly want to get away from it all. \nSpecial deals at Bandara Villas start from 7,784++ per night in a Panoramic Villa (through Nov 17), while a night in a Deluxe room at Bandara Beach starts from B2,919++ (through Oct 31). Book online using promo code \"BM5HO\" to receive a 5% discount. To celebrate Halloween, the Midnight burger set (B666) with purple potato French fries is available until the end of October at all Bandara properties. Pay for the burger set to enter an eating competition on Oct 31 at Bandara Villas. Top three eaters win prizes. Money raised will go to support a local school. \nV Bandara Resort, Phuket, 96 Moo 8, Wichit, Muang, Phuket. \nC www.bandaraphuket.com, fb.com/bandaraphuket, 076-316-298.   1 people liked / 0  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:53:29.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
