Photograph by: Handout photo , Frontenac Club Inn \nThe intriguing Frontenac Club Inn in Kingston , Ont., is living history. It is an architectural fusion of a bank dating from the 1800s, a grand private house and a bowling alley. \nEventually, the property became a private gentlemen’s club and now it’s one of the most popular inns in the area. \nThat is a story I couldn’t refuse, so I set off for Kingston, the oldest city in Ontario, founded as Fort Frontenac in 1673 and Canada’s capital during the 1840s. (Ottawa didn’t get the nod until the 1850s.) Today Kingston is hopping with bistros, culture and a picturesque waterfront where cruises depart for the Thousand Islands . \nThe Frontenac Club Inn is two blocks from Kingston’s central Market Square and Lake Ontario and a few blocks from Queen’s University and the Rogers K-Rock Centre , a concert and hockey venue. \nWinner of a design award for historic preservation, the Frontenac is one of the limestone landmarks in a district of fine architecture. Equally stately neighbours along King St. include city hall, the Customs House, the Empire Insurance Company and St. George’s Cathedral. \nTHE ACCOMMODATIONS \nThe property once was owned by a major antique dealer, so the inn is decorated with lots of armoires, vintage photos and country collectibles. Today the innkeepers are Beare Weatherup, a jovial host who cooks and serves breakfast, and his wife, Susan Shaw, who takes care of administration. \nThe inn’s bank wing is particularly distinguished. The entrance has a striking black and white marble floor, and one salon was the manager’s imposing office, with heavy oak doors and an elaborately carved wood-panelled wall. \nOne of the Frontenac’s meeting rooms is called The Lanes because it was part of the bowling alley. The fine hardwood floors are still intact. \nThe Chapman Room is genteel and clubby, a combination lounge and library, rich with leather sofas, fine tables, books and board games. Nat King Cole and Nina Simone are on the jazzy playlist, and talented guests are invited to play the piano. Coffee and tea are available in a butler’s pantry that used to be a bank vault, and you can bring your own wine. \nComfortable, handsome and well equipped, all of the rooms have TVs, hair dryers, air conditioning and fine Aveda bath products, and some have gas fireplaces. \nThe property attracted many prominent guests when it was a private club, and some of the 16 rooms are named after notables including Alexander Graham Bell, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Gen. Sir Arthur Currie and Titanic survivor Lady Duff-Gordon. \nThe Peterson Room, honouring Canadian singer Colleen Peterson, has a claw-foot tub and an office space. The grand Sandburg Suite, named for Pulitzer Prizewinning author Carl Sandburg, has 13-foot ceilings, a fancy sitting room, a king-sized bed, a double whirlpool bath and a glass shower. The Stone Room is another standout. It has special touches such as a private patio, a gas fireplace and original arched, leaded glass windows. The best modern-day perk is a double rain shower with jets. \nThe Frontenac’s garden is a breath of fresh air in summer and fall. Shaded by maples, the wrought-iron chairs and tables are scattered through an untamed greenery of ivy, bushes and colour pops of perennials like peonies and lilacs. \nTHE MEAL PLAN \nWith three buildings interconnected, the Frontenac has several comfy niches. Breakfast, served in small, connected dining spaces, is several courses, featuring juice, seasonal fruit, yogurt, granola and a hot dish of the day that might be eggs Frontenac with smoked salmon and tomatoes on rosemary focaccia; waffles with strawberries and rhubarb; or French toast topped with peaches, bananas, berries or apples and cheddar. \nThe Frontenac Club Inn is deeply rooted in Kingston and features products from local purveyors, including Cooke’s Fine Foods and Coffee, which opened in 1865 and is arguably North America’s oldest grocery; Kingston Olive Oil Company, which is a terrific place to visit for tastings; and Pan Chanco Bakery , run by Chez Piggy , Kingston’s best-known restaurant. \nChez Piggy was created more than 30 years ago by Zal Yanovsky of the 1960s pop group the Lovin’ Spoonful and his partner Rose Richardson, and now is operated by his daughter Zoe Yanovsky. Located in a former horse stable built in 1806, Chez Piggy has stone and wood decor and a menu of eclectic fine dining. \nSome of the signature dishes include Muscovy duck confit, Vietnamese spring rolls, bone marrow with truffles and scallops with a coconut-lemon grass sauce. \nThe beef, chicken, vegetables and other produce are sourced locally, local microbrews are on tap and some of the wine is from Ontario’s respected vineyards. \nIF YOU GO \nKingston is off Highway 401, halfway between Montreal and Toronto (approximately three hours each way). \nFrontenac Club Inn: 613-547-6167, frontenacclub.com ; 225 King St. E., entrance at 30 William St., Kingston. \nPrice: Until Oct. 31, $169-$259 for two, including breakfast, Wi-Fi, parking.
