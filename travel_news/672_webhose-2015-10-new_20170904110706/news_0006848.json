It really knocked me for six.\n'They told me I had a rare type, and that they wouldn't know exactly what it was until they took it out.\n'I had been really excited for the holiday. I booked it because I felt like I really needed a rest and I thought I would just chill out and do nothing.\nThe airline offered her a £127 voucher for the flights which she was told had to be used within six months\n'I was really disappointed when I found out we couldn't go, and so was my other half.\n'When I told easyJet I couldn't go, it was a woman on the other end of the phone.\n'I told her I had breast cancer, but she wasn't as sympathetic as I thought she was going to be.\n'I guess she was just doing her job, but it upset me that she didn't react. You expect a bit of sympathy, especially from a woman.\n'She put me on hold and came back and said all they could do was offer me a voucher of £127, to redeem within the next six months.\n'I wasn't expecting to get the whole £400 back, but it was a bit of a slap in the face.'\nMrs Rowland is due to start radiotherapy in six weeks' time, which could go on for months\nHelen was due to fly out to Antalya from Manchester on October 6 and fly back ten days later.\nBut weeks before she was diagnosed with breast cancer and told she would need an operation during her booked holiday.\nShe is also due to start radiotherapy in six weeks' time, which could go on for months.\nShe said easyJet told her they did not make refunds if a booking was cancelled more than 24 hours after it was made.\nThe company's terms also state refunds are not offered when passengers are 'unable to fly owing to any change in personal circumstances, including but not limited to medical grounds'.\nHelen, a home carer, added: 'The holiday company was absolutely fantastic, but easyJet more or less said good luck with that one.\n'I was just gobsmacked really. We spent £400 and they have been really insensitive.\n'I haven't spoken to them since that conversation, and they haven't got in touch to apologise or anything.\n'I just think it is disgusting. I offered to send all the papers and everything from the hospital that prove it, but nobody wanted to know.\n'It would be nice to have a refund, or at least an apology.'\nEasyJet has now offered her a voucher for the full cost of her flight - but still refused to refund her money\nAfter being contacted by the press easyJet has backed down and offered her a voucher for the full cost of her flight - but still refused to refund her money.\nA spokeswoman said: 'We sympathise with Ms Rowland's situation which is why, although our tickets are usually non-refundable, we have offered to provide her with a flight voucher for the full value of the trip she is unable to take while she is undergoing treatment (excluding an administrative fee of £13.)\n'Ms Rowland has explained that she may be unable to use this voucher in the very near future and as such, given her individual circumstances, we will extend the date by which she needs to use the voucher to three years.\n'We always recommend customers have comprehensive travel insurance to cover for unexpected circumstances and will always provide a letter to insurance companies when customers need to make a claim.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LdutDh"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:26:48.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
