Although you feel as if you're deep in the boonies as you drive along the mostly unpaved road, you're never more than half a dozen miles from the freeway.\nThings to note along the way:\nWest Clear Creek Wilderness: The thick green canopy of the sycamores and cottonwoods that stand along West Clear Creek contrasts dramatically with the terra-cotta cliffs that tower above it. The West Clear Creek Trail leads from the Bull Pen area east along the creek but can be hard to follow in places.\nDetails: 928-203-2900, redrockcountry.org/recreation/trails.shtml .\nV-Bar-V Heritage Site: The densely packed petroglyph panels, which date from around 1150 to 1400, hold a hodgepodge of stylized birds, animals, humanoid figures and geometric patterns.\nDetails: 9:30 a.m.-3 p.m. Fridays through Mondays. A $5 Red Rock Pass is required. 928-282-3854, redrockcountry.org/recreation/cultural/v-bar-v.shtml .\nThe Bell Trail: Rancher Charles Bell built this trail in the 1930s to move his cattle. Now it's a hiker favorite. About 3.3 miles along, the trail reaches Wet Beaver Creek at Bell Crossing, an area shaded by cottonwoods, sycamores, willows and ash. About 50 yards upstream you'll find a swimming hole. Beaver Creek Campground ($16 per night, no utility hookups) is a quarter-mile from the trailhead.\nDetails: 928-203-2900, redrockcountry.org/recreation/trails.shtml .\nDon't miss: Fort Verde State HisÂ­toric Park in Camp Verde traces its history to the end of the Civil War, when military volunteers arrived to protect settlers in the region. By 1866, regular Army troops had established the post that, in 1878, was renamed Fort Verde. It was used by the military until 1891.\nDetails: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Thursdays-Mondays. 125 E. Hollamon St., Camp Verde. $2-$5. 928-567-3275, azstateparks.com/parks/fove .\nTotal miles: About 212, round trip. From central Phoenix, take Interstate 17 north to Camp Verde. Go east on Arizona 260 about 7 miles, then turn northeast (left) on Forest Road 618. Go 2.3 miles to FR 215, which you take about 3 miles east to the Bull Pen. (This road is rough, narrow and steep in places, but as long as the weather's good, you won't need four-wheel drive.) Return to FR 618 and continue north 9.5 miles to the turnoff to the V-Bar-V Heritage Site. After your visit, continue north, then west about half a mile to the signed turn off to the Bell Trail. From there it's about 2 miles west to I-17 south to Phoenix.", "external_links": ["http://azstateparks.com/parks/fove", "http://redrockcountry.org/recreation/trails.shtml", "http://redrockcountry.org/recreation/cultural/v-bar-v.shtml"], "published": "2015-10-16T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:25:05.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
