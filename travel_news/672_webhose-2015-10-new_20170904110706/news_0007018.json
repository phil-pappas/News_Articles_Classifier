If you are thinking about going. Go. \nFlying down the Dalmatian coast your eyes are indulged with stark, rugged barren mountains, sea made with blues you didn't even know existed and islands fanning out into the water like the ends of a hipsters frayed T-shirt. \nThe bus in from the airport to the city centre is no less inspiring as it winds its way along the coast, down into the town and along the walls of the old city. RACHEL BASEVI/SUPPLIED \nDubrovnik at night. \nThe old city, made more famous by a certain Kings Landing in , is stunning. Thick, tall walls mark the perimetee with a sheer drop to the ocean on its coastal side and surrounded by a dry moat inland. Orange-roofed buildings are crammed into the centre and spill out onto the surrounding hillside. \nThe city (outside of July/August) has the added advantage of not having the \"ruined by tourism\" vibe. \nIt is small, pretty and full of good food. Meals in and around Dubrovnik incorporate lots of local wine, homemade liqueurs, olive oil, bread, grilled veggies, salads, fish and grilled meat. What's your top travel tip? Share your stories, photos and videos. \nAnother win for the less affluent traveller is cheap accommodation. Lots of hostels are available but if you want to treat yourself (or are travelling with a few people) you can get a nice apartment overlooking the port for â‚¬35 (NZ$60) per night - courtesy of Airbnb.co.nz . \nIf you have a day to spare Viator.com does day trips to various coastal locations as well as across borders to Montenegro (I didn't even know it was a country until two weeks ago), and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is totally worth the visit. We went to Mostar and its famous old bridge, whilst getting very educated on the recent war history during the demise of Yugoslavia. Some of the buildings still have bullet holes through them. \nThe port in Dubrovnik is full of ferry boats for excursions to any of the several surrounding Islands. \nOld ladies sit at the city entrances selling knitted sweatshirts and baby slippers. It's a nice contrast to the normal touristy areas in Europe where men selling sunglasses and handbags try to force their wares onto you. They even have a few trusty Irish pubs playing the rugby (crucial when travelling during the Rugby World Cup). Ad Feedback \nIn short - Go to Dubrovnik. It's pretty. Good food. Good wine. Cool Castle. Pretty City. And it plays the Rugby. \nHere's a handy little hint. June and September are the times to go. The temperature is warm but not too warm and the place is free enough from tourists that you can get more of a feel for the place with the added bonus of not being jostled in a crowd and waiting in long lines for overpriced everything. \nAll the prices are cheaper too. So if you can go outside of the main two months it is well worth it. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:52:13.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
