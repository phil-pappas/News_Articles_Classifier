The new ship will be based in China year-round beginning in summer 2017 and become the first vessel built specifically for Chinese guests incorporating a unique blend of international and Chinese features. \n\"Royal Princess and Regal Princess were named after iconic previous vessels, while Majestic Princess will carry a name that was chosen by our global employees,\" said Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises. \"The name Majestic Princess is well suited to the Princess Cruises experience in China, and she will offer a truly magnificent experience to our Chinese guests,\" added Swartz. \nBefitting her dedication to the Chinese market, Majestic Princess will also carry a Chinese name on the hull (Shèng Shì Gōng Zhǔ Haò) – an interpretation selected by Carnival plc's China employees, which has the suggestive meaning of \"Grand World\" or \"Grand Spirit.\" \nThe 143,000-ton vessel, Majestic Princess, is being built at the Fincantieri shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy. She will be home-ported in Shanghai, carrying 3,560 guests for cruises to Japan and Korea, and will offer many of the special features that have made Royal Princess and Regal Princess so popular and distinctive. These include a dramatic multi-story atrium serving as the social hub of the ship; the unique over-the-ocean SeaWalk - a glass-floor walkway extending 8 meters (28 feet) beyond the edge of the ship; the Princess Live! interactive studio; and the special Chef's Table Lumiere, a private dining experience that surrounds guests in a curtain of light.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:40:51.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
