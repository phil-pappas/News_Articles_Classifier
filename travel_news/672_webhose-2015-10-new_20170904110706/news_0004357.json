In a world of growing choice, travel classes, routes and airline alliances, we must drive forward the overall passenger experience to make journeys as seamless, safe and smooth as possible,” said Mr. Al Baker. \n“It is in this same regard that Qatar Airways is pleased to announce its pilot program with Farelogix, whereby we would now extend this experience to our travel agent partners and intermediaries on the ground. This will enable everyone to experience our airline’s premium products before passengers have even stepped onto a plane.\" \nAimed at enhancing the capability of communications between airlines, travel agents and intermediaries, the NDC will provide all users with a richer, personalized and dynamic interface, allowing Qatar Airways to showcase its products. Qatar Airways has been actively engaged in the evolution of the IATA NDC program since it was first introduced in 2012. \nQatar Airways NDC initiative with Farelogix focuses on showcasing the airline’s premium products across all class of cabins, supported by the additional content made available via the NDC standard messaging format. \n“Working with Qatar Airways on this NDC initiative provides us with a tremendous opportunity to showcase the flexibility, scalability, and speed to market of our proven technology for enabling airline-controlled distribution and merchandising,” says Jim Davidson, President and CEO of Farelogix. “We look forward to seeing the results Qatar Airways will achieve by implementing dynamic offers and taking advantage of personalization – two core tenets of NDC.” \nQatar Airways is one of the fastest growing airlines operating one of the youngest fleets in the world. Now in its 18th year of operations, Qatar Airways has a modern fleet of 166 aircraft flying to 152 key business and leisure destinations across six continents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:58:56.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
