Those spectators who were lucky enough to be at the Copper Box during the London 2012 Paralympic Games for the wheelchair rugby competition saw some of the most exciting sport of that whole memorable summer. No one there for the semi-final between USA and Canada – nor those millions watching on television – will ever forget that thrilling game. Britain’s four-time Paralympian Alan Ash called it “jaw-dropping stuff”. “It was probably the best game I have seen in my 20 years of playing,” he said. Those two teams, and Britain, and the rest of the best in the world, are returning to the Copper Box this month for the inaugural BT World Wheelchair Rugby Challenge. Australia, the Paralympic champions in London, are ranked No.1 in the world, above Canada and the US, while Japan, who beat Britain in London, are fourth, one place above the hosts. Ash, who missed the London Games, will be there, too, in Britain’s 12-strong squad, captained by Chris Ryan, who last month won the European Championship in Finland. And you could be there as well. BT is offering five lucky Telegraph readers a pair of tickets to the final of the BT World Wheelchair Rugby Challenge on 16 October. Whoever makes it through, the atmosphere at the 6,000-capacity Copper Box in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London is sure to be crackling. You can enjoy the only full-contact wheelchair sport at its best, and see why it used to be known as Murderball. As the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation says on its website, the sport has been “wrecking wheelchairs around the world since 1977”. And it’s as exciting as ever. BT announced a three-year partnership with GB Wheelchair Rugby (GBWR) earlier this year, becoming its Official Principal Partner, as well as the Official Communications Partner. Through this partnership BT will work with GBWR to continue the transformation of the sport and drive levels of engagement. BT is also supporting several GBWR community programmes to increase participation in Wheelchair Rugby.
