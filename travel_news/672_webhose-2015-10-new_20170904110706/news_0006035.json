Trips fill up rapidly during this time period so it is suggested that vacationers book early. Find out more. Look at this article. \nOctober is here and that means Halloween is not far behind, and if you want to do something besides trick-or-treating this year, then you should plan a fun Halloween getaway. What better vacation is there than an air tour at the Grand Canyon? You can begin one of these tours in Vegas, Boulder City, and Tusayan, Arizona. Grand Canyon flights run every day of the year except Christmas Day, so Halloween is a great time to travel. October is a great time of year to tour the Grand Canyon, and because of that the tours will fill up fast, so you want to book your tour as soon as possible. Las Vegas Helicopter Tours If you take a helicopter tour that lifts off from Boulder City or Las Vegas, then you will fly to the West Rim. The West Rim is a lot of fun because you can raft along the smooth waters of the Colorado River and walk out on the massive glass Skywalk. Of course, you'll have to take a landing tour if you want to add some fun adventures to your flight package. Another good thing about going to the West Rim is that it's the only location at the Grand Canyon where helicopters can fly down to the Canyon floor and land. An air tour is fantastic in itself. Your flight gives you many scenic views, you'll even get to see the Hoover Dam and Lake Mead. There are so many amazing sights to see at the Grand Canyon, the only way to appreciate them all is to take a helicopter tour. If you have the time and money, a landing tour is nice. Landing at the Canyon enhances your tour, and you won't miss anything on the aerial portion of the tour since the choppers follow the same flight path as the helicopters that fly on the air-only tours. Besides, you wouldn't want to go to the West Rim and miss your chance to stand 4000 feet above the bottom of the Canyon on the glass Skywalk. While the view from the air is amazing, you'll also be amazed at the view of the Canyon walls while floating along the Colorado River when you add on a boat tour. The good thing about West Rim landing tours is you can create a tour package that includes all the fun activities you want to experience while you're there. One of the bottom landing tours includes a Champagne picnic so you can toast your thrilling descent to the Canyon floor and the flight of a lifetime. South Rim Tours The South Rim in Arizona unfortunately doesn't allow for landing tours, but there are some other options that make this an exciting part of the Canyon to visit. You can choose a flight that takes you all the way to the wilderness area of the North Rim. The North Rim is very remote and mysterious, and it's one of the least visited areas of the Grand Canyon. Other Grand Canyon helicopters that fly here offer a longer flight that lets you see the remote North Rim as well as all of the park over to the eastern boundary. This second option is so extensive that you will see three quarters of the National Park. The longer tour costs a little more, but it is worth it since you get to see so much of the park from the air. Helicopters Tour operators use different aircraft on these tours, so if you want the smoothest ride, you should book a tour on a deluxe chopper. Deluxe tours ensure that you will fly in an EcoStar 130 helicopter. This chopper is roomier and has comfortable seats, plus it is quieter and best of all, it has a huge wraparound window that gives you panoramic, unobstructed views. Deluxe tours in Vegas are also more convenient because they depart directly from the Las Vegas Strip and include a limousine shuttle service. If you book a basic Vegas tour, you will depart from Boulder City and need to ride a shuttle bus to get to the helipad. Paying more to upgrade to a deluxe tour means you will receive the most convenience, comfort, and views on your tour. So if it fits in your budget, be sure to book a deluxe tour. If not, there's still nothing else that compares to flying a basic package to the Grand Canyon. Wrapping Up Halloween is the perfect time to squeeze in one last vacation before the winter holidays. When you book an air tour, you can add on different fun adventures to create the perfect getaway for your schedule and budget. To ensure you are able to secure your tickets, you should book within the next week. Book online to take advantage of the best prices available , and prepare yourself for a Halloween like no other.
