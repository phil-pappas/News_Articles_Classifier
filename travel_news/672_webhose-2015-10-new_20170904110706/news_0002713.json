According to a survey of 5,000 British people, one in four eat their main meal alone. A whopping 78 per cent said that they rarely or never invite friends or family over at mealtimes. How awful, you might think. We did. But instead of being depressed about the decline of simple societal habits, this was food for thought, and this thought turned into the inspiration to think of all the other things that have died out of modern society. Photo: Alamy Ringing the house phone The only people that ring the house phone anymore are PPI scammers and your mother. Granted, this is something that technology, as well as time, has killed, for no longer do you need to be in the house, near a landline, to receive verbal correspondence from your nearest and dearest. Anything involving a fax machine or a scanner Can you remember the last time you used a fax machine? We can’t. Only the very slow-to-catch-on businesses still use them, and returning anything with a scanned copy? Forget it. So 1999. The 'blind' in blind date For those not au fait with the pre-date gentle internet trawl - done in order to glean as much information about your opposite number as possible - the blind date hasn’t died a death. For anyone else – what’s a blind date? Sure, you can still be set up with people *on* a blind date, but how blind it is really varies on your internet usage. Photo: Alamy Maps Paper maps, to be specific. As much as we love an Ordnance Survey map, Google Maps is king pin, taking over our phones, computer screens and satnav displays. There’s no more simultaneously reading page 357 and page 12 in the AA road map that permanently lives on your back seat; simply tap a postcode in and your technology will do it for you. Punctuality Time was when people turned up on time for things, because technology didn’t allow you to send a text message saying ‘sorry, just running late!’ or ‘can we make it 7.15, not 7pm’, even though you’re already standing outside the cinema waiting. Can we be the first to campaign for the return of timeliness (and manners , while we’re at it)? For those of us still at work, lunch breaks Once upon a time, people went home for lunch. Now lunch is ‘al desko’ , and all the more boring for it. Those long boozy lunches? Gone. Popping home to stir the slow cooking brisket? Gone. All gone. Now your view is the polluted road outside and the buses that draw up for passengers in the rain. Bleak. Photo: Alamy Boredom Some say that only boring people get bored, but the simple fact is that in the 21st century where there’s something to do at all times, there is no such thing as boredom . Or, specifically, no such thing as sitting still doing nothing. Can you remember the last time you just ‘were’, just existed, just sat down and did nothing? Bet you can’t. (Neither can we.) Constant use of memory Apart from students at medical school, memory has all but died out for most of us. Need to remember (for any particular reason) what year King George II died? You can google it. Want to ring your mother on a Sunday morning before church? Off you go to your phone, where her number is saved. There’s no need to attempt to remember everyone’s phone numbers anymore: even your in case of emergency number is plugged into your phone. telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:23:16.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
