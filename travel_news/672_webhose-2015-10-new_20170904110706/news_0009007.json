Szigeti, HTA president and CEO. \"With our year-round temperate climate, Hawaii is an ideal location to host this premier sporting event. We look forward to welcoming the team, their families and the fans to experience the Hawaiian Islands. Soccer is one of the most popular sports worldwide and having the USWNT here will showcase our ability to host sporting events of this caliber.\" \nIn July 2015, the USWNT beat Japan to take the title of 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup Champion. As a part of the Victory Tour, the team will play Trinidad and Tobago at Aloha Stadium and will be broadcast on Fox Sports 1 and FOX Sports GO. \nThis is the first time that the USWNT has played in the Hawaiian Islands. The tour began on Aug. 16, 2015 in Pittsburgh and Honolulu is the seventh stop of a 10-city tour. \n\"When I took this job I was told of the importance of having a wide footprint in terms of where we bring the team to play and this first-ever game in Hawaii certainly stays true to that goal,\" said US head coach Jill Ellis. \"We always enjoy going to new markets and giving fans across the country, and in December across the Pacific Ocean, a chance to see the team play. I know the players and staff are very excited about going to Hawaii and we are looking forward to the experience of being on Oahu and playing this historic match against T&T at the Aloha Stadium.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:54:27.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
