As she told The Wall Street Journal upon the opening of her very first showroom in New York this past July, “In a pristine room, you wonder if you want to be there because the [homeowners] obviously don’t live in that room. When you see a stack of newspapers, that’s the room you want to be in.” The idea of desirable imperfection is one that Williams has, ironically, perfected, and since 2008 she has been translating this kind of subtle yet sophisticated aesthetic into a collection of decor inspired by her work throughout the years.\nThis month, the Bunny Williams Home collection can be seen in a shiny new catalog featuring expanded offerings that include a debut line of beds, benches, stools, chairs, and lamps. The pieces, which include a triangular pen shell lamp, a stained walnut bed, and a classic chaise, were created with the same casual-elegant style she’s become known for among her well-heeled Upper East Side clientele. Besides the covetable furniture, there is another star of note in the shiny new catalog. Williams reveals, “The dog on the cover is my rescue terrier-mix, Annabelle. Anyone who knows me knows that my dogs have the run of the house.”\nWhile her four-legged friends may be the head of the manor, Williams is the master of making it all feel like home, blending the luxurious with the laid-back and making everything in any room come together just perfectly enough.\nAbove, a peek at 12 pieces from the new Bunny Williams Home catalog that will transform any space.", "external_links": ["http://www.bunnywilliamshome.com/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/interior-designer-bunny-williams-on-dogs-and-elegance-1437677927", "http://bunnywilliams.com/interiordesign/"], "published": "2015-10-20T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:32:29.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
