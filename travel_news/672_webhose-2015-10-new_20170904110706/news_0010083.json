That's the tough \"value proposition\" some airlines face in selling premium economy. To be sure, Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific and Singapore have recently joined the ranks of airlines that offer premium economy, but in many ways it's still a product in search of a market.\nThe basic concept of premium economy is simple: more comfortable than regular economy with better cabin service; less expensive than business class. You'd think that formula would appeal to a sizable minority of leisure travelers who are fed up with today's miserably overcrowded economy class: After all, \"comfortable economy seat\" is an oxymoron. But the unfortunate fact is that, in most cases, the extra fare for premium economy turns off a lot of potential customers.\nThe term \"premium economy\" covers two very different approaches. Here, I'm focused on what I call \"true premium economy\" that combines six to 10 inches of extra legroom with at least two -- and more often three to five -- extra inches of seat width, along with upgraded cabin service, and on most lines, some combination of no-charge checked baggage, priority boarding, advance seat assignment, and other services typically offered only as optional, for a stiff fee.\nTrue premium economy is confined almost entirely to long-haul intercontinental transatlantic, transpacific, and Asia-to-Europe routes in wide-body planes. Air Canada is the only North American airline to offer true premium economy, but Air China, Air France, Air New Zealand, Alitalia, ANA, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, China Southern, EVA, JAL, LOT, Lufthansa, OpenSkies, Qantas, SAS, Singapore, Virgin Atlantic, and Virgin Australia offer it on intercontinental flights. Most of those airlines have adopted what amounts to a common standard:\n-- Seat pitch (front-to-rear spacing of seat rows) at 38 inches, compared with regular economy at 30 to 32.\n-- Eight seats per row, rather than the usual 10, in 747s , 777s, and the lower deck of A380s; seven seats per row rather than the usual nine in 787s, A330-340s, and the upper deck of A380s, and six seats per row instead of the usual seven on 767s. SeatGuru and other sources show widths at only an inch or two wider than regular economy, but those figures, based on cushion width, understate the actual increased shoulder-level room afforded by much wider armrests; the real difference is more like three to five inches.\nA few, notably Air New Zealand, Norwegian, Open Skies, and Turkish exceed those standards.\nThe standard offers, in total, about 40 percent more room than regular economy, as Air France touts in its promotion. But on most lines, the fare difference is higher. I checked fares for a one-week round-trip in mid-October:\nAcross the Atlantic, premium-economy fares on nonstop flights ranged between 1.7 and 2.1 times the cheapest economy tickets. The main exceptions are Lufthansa, charging 1.3 times regular economy Los Angeles to Frankfurt, and Norwegian, charging 3.2 times its very low minimum economy fare but about the same as premium on other lines. As a matter of interest, I found that business class on LaCompagnie from New York to London or Paris is less expensive than premium economy.\nAcross the Pacific, with its longer flights, travelers do a bit better, at 1.4 to 1.5 regular economy fares on EVA and Japan Airlines, and 1.8 to 1.9 times regular economy on China Southern, China, Qantas, and Virgin Australia. But Air New Zealand charges 3.8 times the regular economy fare for its deluxe version of premium economy.\nSo the question arises as to just who is willing to pay around double to move out of the cattle car on 15 to 30 hours of flying. A couple on vacation might question an extra $1,600, for example, compared with what else they could do with $1,600. Probably a more likely user is a business traveler whose company won't pay business class.\nThe take-away here is simple. Yes, you can escape the cattle car on many intercontinental routes without paying an exorbitant business-class fare. But double the cheapest ticket is likely to remain a tough sell for most leisure travelers.\n(Send e-mail to Ed Perkins at eperkins@mind.net .
