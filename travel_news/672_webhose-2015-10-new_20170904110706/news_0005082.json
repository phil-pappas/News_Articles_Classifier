If granted, that could start a 30-day countdown to a strike, but mediators haven't acted on a similar Teamsters request lodged in January.\nAirline unions can't legally strike unless mediators agree that further negotiations are pointless, and strikes at U.S. carriers are rare. Allegiant pilots threatened to strike earlier this year but were blocked by a court order.\nTeamsters Local 1224 said Allegiant's pilots are overworked and underpaid.\nThe Las Vegas-based airline, part of Allegiant Travel Co., said there has been progress in contract talks. In a letter to employees, chief operating officer Steve Harfst said the company wants to give pilots higher wages, better retirement plans and a union-sponsored health plan.\nNegotiations are scheduled to resume Oct. 26.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:18:42.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
