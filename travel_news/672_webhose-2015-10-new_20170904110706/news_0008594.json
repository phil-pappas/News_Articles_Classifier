They will say there is no demand and, if there was, someone else would have already created it,” he says. He received these comments when he co-founded The New Covent Garden Soup Co in 1989. In 2011 the business was sold to the Hain Celestial Group for $230m. Clearly, it can pay to be stubborn. But, while perseverance has helped Mr Stapleton overcome many hurdles during more than 25 years in business, having an eye for a market opening certainly helps. “If you have done your market research and are bloody-minded enough, you will ignore the negativity and go on and succeed,” says Mr Stapleton. A business will only flourish if it has talented staff and people are managed effectively When it was launched, New Covent Garden Soup Co had no competitor in the natural soups market, nor was there stiff competition when it hit the US in 1998. In 2005 Mr Stapleton also co-founded Little Dish, which pioneered the toddler chilled-food category by developing natural food for kids aged over one. When that launched, perhaps surprisingly, he was told retailers would not allocate space to a new category and parents would not trust a small brand. The will to succeed can only get you so far, though. Most new businesses need funding to scale up, and Mr Stapleton was able to garner some initial funds from family and friends, then business angels and eventually venture capitalists. Each was its own milestone. “Anyone investing in your new business will, rightly, do their due diligence on you and have tough questions,” says Mr Stapleton. “But you need to look beyond the funding stage and do your own checks on potential investors, so you have a pro-active board. What added value will an investor bring?” Sustained success requires great people, and a business will only flourish if it has talented staff and people are managed effectively. Mr Stapleton says the challenge at the start of any venture can be finding people who share your vision and are as motivated as you, even if their earning potential is initially limited. Finding the right people up front pays dividends later on, he explains. “I link recruitment with managing staff, because if you are struggling to manage then you have made recruiting mistakes,” he says. “I could not pay people a lot at the start so I gave them autonomy to develop their part of the business rather than trying to micro-manage them.” And when it comes to small businesses, while autonomy is crucial to get top productivity from your team, clear short-, medium- and long-term goals are a must if you want to avoid your strategy becoming muddled. “My mission for Little Dish was to make kids’ lives healthier and parents’ lives easier. Once I was clear about this vision I could implement the strategy,” he says. Little Dish outsources manufacturing, accounts, HR and PR, says Mr Stapleton, “so everyone inside the company is focused on the brand.” The lesson is clear: stay focused, and you’ll set yourself up for success.
