The airline said it would encourage voluntary departures but would resort to layoffs if incentive packages didn’t prompt enough workers to leave. “The firings would be the first … since the mid-1990s” at Air France, which also is reportedly looking to reduce its long-haul flying as it faces increased competition both in Europe from low-cost carriers and in long-haul markets from the so-called “Gulf carriers” of the Middle East.\nAir France intends to eliminate about 300 pilot positions, about 900 flight attendant positions and about 1,700 ground workers, union officials tell of London.\nSince a 1993 effort to lay off workers led to the ouster of then-CEO Bernard Attali, Air France has since turned to “attrition and early retirement packages to reduce the payroll.”\nBut it’s the renewed possibility of layoffs this year that apparently set off Monday’s clash.\nAlthough Monday’s scuffle was unusually violent, labor relations in France are commonly testy, with unions sometimes even resorting to holding managers hostage — or ‘boss-napping’ — to make a point.”\nAir France parent company Air France-KLM said it planned legal action regarding the “aggravated violence” carried out against its managers Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:43:01.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
