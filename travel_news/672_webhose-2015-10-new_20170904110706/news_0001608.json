It is the second consecutive win for The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. \nIts winning streak continued at the Singapore Sustainability Awards, an initiative of the Singapore Business Federation, where it was accorded the “S ustaina ble Business Awards” for its innovative and impactful green solutions. \nMr. Benny Zin, Chief Operating Officer and Vice President of Conventions and Exhibitions, Marina Bay Sands, said, “We are deeply honoured to win three big awards on one night. They are ringing endorsements of our successful integrated resort model and speak volumes of our passion, commitment and continued innovation to deliver the best results. Our track record in MICE speaks for itself – we have staged 63 new-to-Singapore trade shows since our opening and continue to be the venue of choice for organisers of prestigious international events. We are proud to play a part in helping Singapore’s quest to be the top MICE destination in this region.” \nOver at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, the victory last evening followed a string of accolades in the world of retail. The mall had edged out regional rivals to take home Silver in the 2015 Asia Pacific Shopping Centre Awards ceremony, for its work in “Marketing Excellence, Public Relations & Events”, held in Taipei earlier this week. Organised by the International Council of Shopping Centres (ICSC) 2015 APAC, the Awards recognises the region’s most innovative shopping centres. \nMr. John Postle, Vice President of Retail, Marina Bay Sands, said, “The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is exceptionally pleased to be the recipient of Best Shopping Experience 2015 by the Singapore Tourism Board for the second year in a row, as well as Silver award at the ICSC 2015 APAC. We are humbled by the positive results of our three-year long luxury retail remix, which saw the expansion of many world-leading brands within our mall in the form of stunning flagship stores. We will continue to build on this energy to innovate and create even more reasons for shoppers to visit Singapore in the many years to come.” \nSands Expo continues to attract flagship shows \nHome to Singapore’s largest and most versatile meeting space, Marina Bay Sands has been a forerunner in the MICE industry, offering its clients an unparalleled meeting experience that combines work and play. \nThis year alone, the integrated resort has hosted four of the largest flagship conferences in Singapore, including Jeunesse Global Expo Unite Annual World Conference , Best World Convention 2015 , Oriflame Diamond Conference 2015 and Forever Living Global Rally 2015 . One of the highlights this year was a record-breaking attendance of more than 7,000 delegates during the Forever Living Global Rally – also the biggest corporate event in a single congregation that Marina Bay Sands has hosted to date. \nThe integrated resort is also gearing up for a busy quarter with a series of significant events taking prime estate at Sands Expo and Convention Centre from now until end of the year. Last week, it hosted the world’s leading financial services event Sibos 2015 , which returned to the Republic after 12 years. The four-day business forum received over 8,000 delegates from all over the world and occupied the entire Sands Expo and Convention Centre. \nThis week, Asia’s leading travel trade show – ITB Asia 2015 – is once again taking place at Marina Bay Sands over 21-23 October. The show first signed an agreement with the integrated resort from 2014 – 2016, where Marina Bay Sands was announced as the official venue partner and official hotel partner. \nCome December, Marina Bay Sands will end 2015 on a high note when it transforms into the Official Games Village for 3,300 athletes and official for the 2015 ASEAN Para Games (3-9 Dec). The integrated resort will be providing 1,500 hotel rooms for the contingent and convert two conference halls for the athletes’ social and dining activities, meeting rooms for technical directors and pop-up booths around the property to raise awareness of para-sports as Singapore hosts the Games for the first time in its history. \nAdding another new-to-Asia and Singapore trade show under its belt, Marina Bay Sands will be hosting Airline Passenger Experience Association Meeting and Exhibition in 2016. The event will see the attendance of delegates from the world’s leading airlines, as well as suppliers and related companies in the aerospace industry. Returning to Marina Bay Sands are also numerous key events such as Tax Free World Association Conference and Exhibition 2016 , Maison et Object Asia 2016 and World Cities Summit 2016 . \nEnhancements across property \nSands Expo and Convention Centre has recently revamped its existing ballrooms to accommodate more mid to large-sized groups of up to 3,500 attendees across a wider range of settings. \nThe new Roselle-Simpor Ballroom located on Level 4 is a combination of two formerly separate ballrooms. Spanning more than 3,700 square metres, it is now the second largest ballroom at Sands Expo after Sands Grand Ballroom on Level 5. Roselle-Simpor can cater to groups of up to 3,500 reception-style, 3,000 for theatre-style seating and 2,000 for classroom and banquet seating. \nThe physical enhancements are complemented by a slew of refreshed programming on property, from new celebrity chef restaurants such as Spago by Wolfgang Puck, to new award-winning exhibitions at ArtScience Museum, an expanded luxury offering at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, and endless entertainment offerings. \nFollowing its successful luxury retail re-launch in April this year, The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands offers the largest collection of luxury labels under one roof in the region, including over 170 luxury and premium brands spanning across bespoke menswear, women’s collections, luxury children’s labels, as well as luxury watch and jewellery brands. \nIt also boasts an unprecedented assembly of 15 luxury duplexes and triplexes, many of which are the brands’ biggest stores in Singapore. It recently celebrated the opening of Furla ’s Singapore flagship store and the biggest in Southeast Asia, as well as the only Loro Piana in town and the biggest Michael Kors store in Singapore to date. \nThis quarter, The Shoppes will welcome the biggest Armani Junior store in Singapore, as well as Parisian designer childrenswear Bonpoint to its Children’s Collection. Other boutiques opening soon include the biggest Valentino store in Singapore, as well as the world’s leading toy retailer Hamley’s of London .
