These new, limited edition treatments – Zanzibar: A Retreat for the Senses and Nakupenda: A Romantic Escape – are meticulously crafted to transport guests to the spice island of Zanzibar where they will be embraced with warming, indigenous botanicals and spices. These artisanal offerings will be available to guests from 1st November 2015 to 28th February 2016. \nCarefully designed to help calm and balance the skin during colder temperatures, the 90-minute Zanzibar: A Retreat for the Senses treatment begins with a hand-made sugar scrub exfoliation infused with hydrating coconut oil and vitamin E along with East African spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, star anise and ginger to bolster circulation. From there, guests will rinse in a soothing, infused steam shower followed by a 60-minute full body massage incorporating the heated herbal poultice to melt away muscle tension. Nakupenda: A Romantic Escape is a comprehensive two-hour treatment where couples are treated to a hand-made sugar scrub combined with a vigorous dry body brushing. Following an herbal steam shower, guests relax in a coconut milk bath, culminating in a tandem poultice massage. Park Hyatt New York’s collaboration with Park Hyatt Zanzibar marks the fourth installment of Spa Nalai’s International Series; following the collaboration with Park Hyatt Paris-Vendôme, Park Hyatt Tokyo and Park Hyatt Dubai. These seasonal experiences are inspired by acclaimed treatments and remedies from award-winning Park Hyatt spas around the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:40:03.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
