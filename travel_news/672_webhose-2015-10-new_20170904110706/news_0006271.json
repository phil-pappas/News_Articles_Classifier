They can help you find the cheapest travel between two locations, and connect you with locals who will show you around the city. \nRemoteOK helps you find jobs around the world. Image: Supplied \nREMOTE OK \nRemote OK is a daily aggregator of remote jobs that is especially useful for those in the tech industry. You can find jobs in web development, design, and also non-tech jobs (though these are admittedly not the focus). Tech jobs are becoming one of the most easily-outsourced sectors, and Remote OK can be a goldmine for a tech worker looking to tour the world while staying afloat financially. \nCOUCHSURFING Couchsurfing is the ultimate lodging tool for anyone on a shoestring budget. The app connects people who want to crash on someone's couch (or spare room) with someone willing to host them for free. Gifts are appreciated, but no money ever actually changes hands. The worldwide community has over 10 million members, and functions on the goodwill of its users. If you've never tried it, it truly is a remarkable feat that this type of community is possible. \nAIRBNB Airbnb has become an international phenomenon, and is swiftly replacing hotels for many travellers. The company has 600,000 listings in over 34,000 cities, and is often more affordable than hotels of similar quality - though without the room service. Depending on your luck, your host might also be willing to share tips like the best places to get public WiFi. And you can even stay in creative abodes like treehouses or yurts. \nAirBNB can help you to find some of the world's most unique accommodation. Image: Supplied \nWIFI FINDER When you are working in unfamiliar territory, it's always good to have a list of available public WiFi. WiFi Finder finds you the closest public WiFi around you. And if you are curious about which cities around the world have the best WiFi, New York, Tel Aviv, and Taipei are all on the list. \nSPEEDLANCER Speedlancer is all about getting you a small freelance job, now, that you get done in 4 hours. It's perfect if you need some quick cash and includes things like design, writing, and data entry. It doesn't require any haggling or interviewing, so you can just do the job, and get paid. And all of it is remote. \nWhatsApp is the best way to keep in touch with friends while travelling. Image: Supplied \nWHATSAPP There is no better way of keeping up with friends or family overseas than using WhatsApp. This is part of the reason why Facebook bought the messaging app for a hefty US$22 billion. WhatsApp allows you to send all kinds of text and multimedia messages while only paying for the data, which can be especially cheap and easy over WiFi. \nHOSTELWORLD Hostelworld is the best app for booking hostels or low-cost hotels. If you like the communal vibe of living with other travellers, this app will help you find the best places. Hostel workers are also often decided-to-stay-travellers themselves, and can be a wealth of information about temporary jobs in the area. \nGOOGLE TRANSLATE Google's translation app is the best free option available for figuring out what the heck someone is saying. Now you can simply point your smartphone camera at things like signs, in foreign languages, and Google will morph the text into your own language. \nGoogle translate could be a lifesaver while on holiday. Image: Supplied \nREMOTE YEAR Remote Year is an ambitious concept to put 75 likeminded people together to travel for a year while they are working remotely. The program is in its first year and costs US$2,000 (NZ$2950) a month. That US$2000 covers accommodations, workspace, and activities. If you have a lucrative remote job locked in, this could be a once-in-a-lifetime way to travel through South America, Europe, and Asia - staying a month at a time in each of 12 cities. The next cycle begins on February 1, and they are currently accepting application. \nBOOMERANG Boomerang is a plug-in that works with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari - and can be invaluable for communicating with people across the globe. It has a lot of great tidbits, but perhaps the most useful is the ability to 'send later.' You just write a message as you normally would and then use either a calendar picker or a text box ('next Monday') to schedule when it will send. You can also set a reminder to yourself if you don't hear back so you know when to follow up. Boomerang lets you answer emails on your own time, wherever in the world you happen to be. \nKeen to Party with a Local? Check out the app. Image: Supplied \nPARTY WITH A LOCAL Sometimes you need to take a break from work and party, but it can be tough to meet people in a new city. Party with a Local connects travellers to locals and expats nearby who want to, well, party. You can even check their profiles and reviews. This app makes it easy to know which random strangers around you are actually open to grabbing a drink. \nGIGROVE GigRove is a cross between Couchsurfing and a freelancing app. With GigRove, startup businesses provide accommodation and, in return, the traveller provides a service. This can be help with social media, photography, or any small task. The traveller knows beforehand so there aren't any crossed wires, and the accommodations are usually better than Couchsurfing. \nNOMAD LIST Nomad List tells you where the cheapest places are to live and work as a digital 'nomad.' You can filter by factors like WiFi access, safety, and weather. And Nomad List easily tells you the cost of living in each place. Expat havens in Thailand like Chiang Mai, Bangkok, and Phuket, rank high on the list. \nFOODSPOTTING Foodspotting is essentially an Instagram for sharing delectable restaurant dishes, complete with where you got them. This app shows you the best food being served up around you, also tagged with the time it was uploaded. It can be a vivid alternative to reading more traditional restaurant reviews while you are travelling. \nTrip Advisor has become a \"travellers dream\". Image: Supplied \nTRIPADVISOR TripAdvisor is a traveller's dream. It has information on what of everything is the best - hotels, sites, restaurants. And the community puts a lot of effort into reviews. These people care about travel, and about sharing the do's and don'ts. \nREAD MORE: \n*This travel app could save your life \nHOPPER Hopper is an app that helps you figure out when exactly is the optimal time to fly.
