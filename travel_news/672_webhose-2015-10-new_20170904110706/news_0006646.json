According to the survey, 73% of consumers consider drivers of ride-hailing service to be employees of the ride-hailing services, when, in actuality, they are independent contractors who are not required to adhere to or comply with the same standards and regulations applicable to taxis and limousines. Only 18% of Americans would continue to use ride-hailing services if they did not adhere to applicable labor laws.\n\"In a society that increasingly values convenience over safety and responsibility, it is the obligation of the National Limousine Association to raise awareness about how ride-hailing services, for reasons of financial gain, are circumventing the fair labor laws and are not required to adhere to or comply with the same safety standards and regulations applicable to taxis and limousines. As the survey clearly illustrates, ride hailing services are misleading passengers, exploiting drivers and putting the public at risk,\" said Scott Solombrino , NLA co-founder.\nTo this end, the National Limousine Association , a not-for-profit organization responsible for and dedicated to representing the interests of the private driver ground transportation industry, launched Ride Responsibly™ ( www.rideresponsibly.org ) in February 2015 . The program is an unprecedented effort to bridge an industry-wide gap between the rights of passengers and the responsibilities of service providers, promoting best practices in regards driver and passenger safety and duty of care.\n\"While the NLA applauds the steps that a handful of cities and municipalities have recently taken action to regulate ride-hailing services, there is much work to be done on a national level,\" adds Gary Buffo , NLA president. \"As these results overwhelmingly enumerate, a more accountable system and universal corporate responsibility remain the ultimate goal. Therefore, it is imperative this debate be afforded the national platform it deserves.\"\nMethodology:\nThis survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of NLA from October 6-8, 2015 among 3,027 adults ages 18 and older. This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated.
