The project is expected to roll early next year. For the female lead, initially the makers were considering casting Kiara Advani, but now apparently, they are in talks with Sonakshi Sinha. Sahar Quaze who has written the dialogues for Chinar-Daastaan-e-Ishq that will mark the return of Faisal Khan on screen after 11 years, is supposedly penning the same for Prabhu’s film too. A source said, “Right now Prabhu and Meher are looking for financers to fund the project. Also, the makers are in talks with Sonakshi to act opposite Prabhu in the film.” We tried to reach out to Prabhu but he remained unavailable for comment.
