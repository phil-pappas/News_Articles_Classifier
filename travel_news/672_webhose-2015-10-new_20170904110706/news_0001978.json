A sixth was detained later in the day.\nAir France blames the violence on \"isolated individuals\" and negotiations have resumed. It is proposing a sweeping plan that involves 2,900 more job losses and longer hours.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:42:19.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
