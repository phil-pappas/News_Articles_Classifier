However, an introductory offer means that until December 31 each euro will be worth six Loops.\nThere are no blackout dates, no status levels, no points expiration date as long as members fly once a year, and no membership cards.\nAll transactions are carried out online at loop.be and up to five family members living in the same property can collect Loops together.\nA statement said: \"Loops can be used on any European Brussels Airlines flight once the customer has flown five return flights or has earned 5,000 Loops. In case the customer does not have enough Loops, he or she can pay in part with points, in part with money.\"\nIt is possible to simultaneously be members of both Loop and Miles & More, but members need to decide which scheme's points they want to warn when flying with Brussels Airlines in Europe.\nNathalie Erdmanis, Brussels Airlines' vice president marketing, said: \"Loop is one of the most generous loyalty programmes currently on the market. It is built around two principles: simplicity and allowing customers to get what they want most as fast as possible â€“ a free flight.\n\"Loop is the perfect complement to our already existing Miles & More. With Loop we now offer more advantages to customers who loyally choose Brussels Airlines but do not necessarily fly every week.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:03:48.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
