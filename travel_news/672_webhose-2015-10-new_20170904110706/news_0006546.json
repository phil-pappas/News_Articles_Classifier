A third of respondents said direct flights, with no stopovers, was top priority when booking flights, while a fifth said it was dependant on the location of the airport and its proximity to their home or hotel. The survey’s results suggest that British holidaymakers are a fickle bunch, with 5 per cent choosing an airline based on collecting frequent flier points, and 13 per cent selecting a carrier based on familiarity and trust. Momondo also quizzed travellers on their preferences for on-flight facilities. As incidents of \"legroom wars\" have become more common in the last year , coupled with the fact that most plane seats are shrinking, it is no surprise perhaps that passengers identified seating as their biggest priority when booking a flight. Thirty-nine per cent said that comfortable seating with ample leg room was their main concern.

The respondents were also not particularly fussed when it came to the nature of the cabin crew, with just 8 per cent saying that service mattered to them. Just 5 per cent said on-board Wi-Fi was a relevant issue, and only 7 per cent said that in-flight entertainment was a priority. Lassa Skole Hansen, from Momondo, said: “We understand Brits love a bargain when it comes to travel. With the number of airlines today competing for sales on the same routes, many travellers are happy to search for bargains to secure the seats they want. “It’s clear though that in-flight comfort is most important to Britons still. Whilst travellers are happy to forego the free gin and tonic or beer, available on more upmarket carriers mid-air, many are booking smarter – opting ahead of time for a mid-range airline at a better price, which offers a modicum of comfort.” Telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:23:54.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
