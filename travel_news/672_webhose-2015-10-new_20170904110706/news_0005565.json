Recognised as an industry leader in promoting the compatibility of golf courses with the environment, Norman’s ‘least-disturbance approach’ design philosophy has created a course that is complementary to the existing topography whilst ensuring the spectacular natural features and dramatic views are maximised to enrich the playing experience.\n“My responsibility when designing a golf course is to ensure it complements the stunning natural surrounds, and at Eastern, to showcase the native flora and fauna that Australia is renowned for. Yarra Valley’s Eastern Golf Club is a truly special place where members can enjoy teeing off with kangaroos while taking in the spectacular views of the surrounding Christmas Hills and Dividing Ranges. This course delivers a natural golf experience and I am proud to be a part of it.” – Greg Norman, Greg Norman Golf Course Design\nThe remaining 9, of the planned 27, holes together with a 9 hole par 3 course are currently under construction and scheduled for completion in April / May, 2016.\nDesigned by leading architects, Perrott Lyon Mathieson, the new Club House reflects an environment of understated elegance whilst engaging with the surrounds through the harmonious choice of building materials; subdued colour selection and a design focus that creates seamless transitions between interior spaces and the natural environment. The surrounding landscape has seen the reintroduction of native plants and the use of rock forms and water to emulate the uniquely Australian landscape.\nAs part of the day’s events, Norman will conduct a coaching clinic for Returned Servicemen and Women, from the Greg Norman Foundation’s charity partner for the opening, Soldier On. Soldier On works to support wounded veterans and their families through a range of rehabilitation and reintegration initiatives and have recently launched their golf programme in NSW and Canberra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:27:02.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
