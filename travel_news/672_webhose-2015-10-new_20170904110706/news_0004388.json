Those conditions coupled with warmer-than-usual ocean temperatures caused by El Nino produced above-average rainfall this year, he said.\nFor the upcoming winter, the opposite will be true.\n\"For us, what would normally be our wet season is expected to flip around and be very dry,\" Kodama said.\nHawaii can expect clear nights and cloudy afternoons this winter but those clouds will not produce much rain, he said. Winter weather systems that normally move through the region slowly will pass by quickly, trade winds will die off and there will be stability in the atmosphere that will hinder rainfall.\nNOAA predicts Hawaii could experience moderate to severe drought during the coming months as many areas are forecast to receive only half of their normal rainfall totals. Some isolated areas will experience extreme drought.\nOfficials say this El Nino is expected to remain in place through the spring and could end up being the strongest El Nino in over 50 years.\nA strong El Nino arrives about once every 20 years. Ocean temperatures show this one to be the second-strongest since such record-keeping began in 1950, according to the National Weather Service.\nKodama said ranchers will see pastures, which are now green because of all the summer rain, degrade in the next couple of months and get worse in the early part of next year. He added that people on rain catchment systems will also feel the effects, having to purchase water for their crops and daily use.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:24:14.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
