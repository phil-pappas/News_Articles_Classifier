Most are dormant and provide fun opportunities to climb, explore lush forests and get amazing views. However there are also a few that are active and offer opportunities for amazing adventures. Plus magnificent shows as they let out gas and ash and even lava. \nBecause there are tons, you are likely to find one as the back ground in many of the main destinations. But, as it happens with everything else, there are a few that can offer a better experience than others. Following are the names of five of the best volcanoes to visit in Central America and the reasons why they are so cool. Arenal volcano, Costa Rica. Oliver Gerhard/Getty Images 1. Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica \nIt is by far one of the most visited destinations of the region. I don’t think that there is a lot of people out there that visit Costa Rica and purposefully ignore Arenal. \nThis is one of the most active volcanoes in the world and lies right next to a gorgeous manmade lake. Aside from looking great from a far (especially at night), there are a few areas that you can climb. It is also surrounded by gorgeous forests where you can hike, walk across massive hanging bridges, relax in naturally heated hot springs or go on a canopy adventure.

This is more of a crater complex than a single volcano. Its shape is so weird that people can drive up to the largest crater. This means that you can actually stand a meter away from the edge. \nThere is also a lookout point just meters above the crater that allows you to look in. But, if you want a truly amazing adventure ask if there are any night tours. That is when you are most likely to see the lava inside of the crater. \nFun Fact: When the Spaniards first arrived to this volcano they called it “La boca del infierno” (the mouth of hell). 3. Pacaya Volcano in Guatemala \nGuatemala is probably the country with the largest amount of volcanoes in Central America. Some are actually active. Among them Pacaya Volcano became very popular because it remains active at a very low level, so visitors can hike up one of its sides and walk right next to lava rivers. Plus the views from up there are great. \nThis is a full day trip, but you don’t need to be an athlete to be able to do the hike. There are cases where you can rent a horse if you feel like you can’t make it. More » 4. Cerro Negro, Nicaragua \nThis one is only a baby that was formed only 150 years ago. In its short life it has been the protagonist of at least 20 significant eruptions. The last one happened in 1999. \nIt became famous because of the fine sand that can be found on the surface of one of its slopes. This fine ash like sand is perfect for volcano boarding. This is definitely something you should try if you are an adventure lover. More » 5. Tajumulco Volcano in Guatemala \nTajumulco Volcano is the highest one in the country and in Central America. A fun way to explore it is by taking an overnight hike and camping adventure. At 14,000 feet tall the volcano is a relatively easy to hike, plus it has been dormant for a while, making it a safer option. \nFun Fact: Tajumulco is the only place where it has ever snowed in Guatemala.
