Global automobile market and industry;\n2. China's automobile market and industry;\n3. Automotive infotainment development trends and supply chain\n4. Automotive infotainment market and industry\n5. Twenty-three key automotive Infotainment vendors\nThe definition of Infotainment is so vague that virtually all vendors have their own definition in this respect. In a broad sense, Infotainment includes simple Audio System (also known as Audio Infotainment) in low-end models and traditional in-vehicle navigation system in mid-end models. In a narrow sense, however, Infotainment contains HMI, Connectivity (WiFi\\3G\\LTE\\Bluetooth\\Mobile Phone), Telematics (Navigation\\Alerts), Entertainment (Radio\\Audio\\Video), and ADAS (Cameras Display\\Black box), that is to say, Hi-end Infotainment.\nToday's Hi-end Infotainment is the mainstream Infotainment in the future. The design of Infotainment software is becoming more and more complicated so much so that traditional Infotainment companies began to aggressively acquire software companies to stabilize their market position. In addition, Infotainment is also getting closer to ADAS. In January 2015 , Harman acquired RedBend, an Israeli software company, for USD170 million and Symphony Teleca for USD870 million .\nIn 2015, Delphi spun off non-core Thermal and Reception businesses, purchased Hellermann Tyton and Ottomatika, and invested two start-ups: Tula and Quanergy. Quanergy mainly specializes in Lidar. In July 2015 , Continental acquired Elektrobit. In future, more software enterprises will be acquired.\nWith the popularity of smartphones, the traditional single navigation system market has been severely squeezed and will be eliminated rapidly. In future, Infotainment is likely to integrate with Head Unit Display and contain the content displayed by Instrument Cluster and Climate Control as the core of Cockpit Electronics. Its control range will be extremely extensive and its display size will get quickly enlarged, to at least 12 inches.\nIn 2014, the market size of generalized Infotainment came to USD33.8 billion , and this figure is expected to hit USD36 billion in 2015. In contrast, the narrowly-defined Infotainment saw a market size of USD18.1 billion in 2014, and the scale is estimated to reach USD22.1 billion in 2015 and USD29.1 billion in 2017. The shipments of narrowly-defined Infotainment totaled 18.9 million units in 2014, and the estimated figures will be 24 million units in 2015, 31.8 million units in 2017, and 36.5 million units in 2020.\nJapanese companies, though as overlords in Infotainment, are not adept at software and therefore are declining. This, coupled with the depreciated yen, has led to an obvious drop. By contrast, the German and US companies grow rapidly.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p0210901-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
