During the past six months, nine of the top 10 most-searched suburbs on the property portal were in Victoria.\nBut it was a different tale for flat seekers. Although the inner-city hub of East Melbourne proved to be the hottest spot for flat seekers across Australia, Victoria only featured twice on the list.\nAccording the numbers, NSW dominated the apartment hit list for most searched suburbs with seven out of 10.

They’ve come into the market with a lot of young professional couples and investors. They all want to stay close to the city in terms of public transport and cafes,” he said.\nMr Shearn said the popularity of Prahran and its “rich” neighbouring suburbs got people clicking there.\n“It’s a unique rectangular piece of real estate where people want to buy for their children. Inquiries seem to be divided between investors and young professionals buying with the assistance of their parents,” he said. Family-friendly suburbs are so hot right now. Source: Supplied\nJohn Cunningham, managing director of Cunninghams and deputy president of the Real Estate Institute of NSW, said demand for Sydney property was still sky high, even after 18 months of huge price growth.\n“When it comes to units in NSW, more new apartment developments are needed each year to cater for demand and population increase,” he said.\nMr Cuningham said the list also showed similarities between Victorian and NSW markets in the types of properties people looked to buy.\n“Empty nesters are also really prominent in the NSW market, however the difference in Sydney is that many are downsizing to luxury new apartments,” he said.\nThe hottest spot in Queensland for house hunters turned out to be Newmarket in suburban north Brisbane. Mario Sultana, of Place Newmarket, said the suburb’s sense of community and amenities made it a standout.

Above all, it’s incredibly convenient with direct access to the CBD, Sunshine Coast and airport. All these factors make it a desirable place to live in Queensland,” he said.\nDown south, Norwood in Adelaide’s east, is the most-searched suburb for both houses and units.\n“Norwood is a melting pot of all ages. Baby boomers are embracing downsizing and doing the cafe thing as well as younger couples who can enjoy smaller units, townhouses and cottages, but still have all the benefits of being close to the city and hitting shops, cafes, and eateries on the weekend,” Tim Threadgold, of Toop & Toop, said.\nRealestate.com.au executive general manager Andrew Rechtman said whether people were househunting or hoping to sell a property, there was value in knowing where the sought-after suburbs were.\n“Realestate.com.au’s Top Sellers’ Markets shows where the highest interest from buyers is. This highlights opportunities for prospective sellers, as well as buyers, as it shows them the suburbs where competition is likely to be hot,” he said.\n This is where South Australians most want to live", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/11/1227564/964921-01893076-6e38-11e5-b58e-513980d2e896.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/11/1227564/964412-10aa6814-6e37-11e5-b58e-513980d2e896.jpg", "http://media.news.com.au/news/2015/10-oct/rea/rea-top-sellers-desktop.jpg", "http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/research-shows-suburbs-most-searched-by-australians/story-fndban6l-1227564961583", "http://www.realestate.com.au/buy", "http://media.news.com.au/news/2015/10-oct/rea/rea-top-sellers-mobile.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/11/1227564/964894-6a80e43a-6be9-11e5-b070-3995a5e0f903.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:43:51.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
