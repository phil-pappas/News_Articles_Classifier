The water was still but for the soft splash of a fisherman’s oar. I was aboard the Honey Dew houseboat, chugging through the sleepy Valiyaparamba backwaters, which snake through Kasaragod, Kerala ’s northernmost region.\nThe newly launched Honey Dew Backwater Cruises offers a cruising experience unlike tourist-thronged Alleppey, where roughly 1,500 kettuvallams (converted rice barges) depart daily in high season. The number of other houseboats I saw on our two-day tour of the 30km waterway could be counted on one hand.\nThe first morning, I struggled to relax. My busy mind was trying to adjust to doing, well, nothing. But as I gazed at the shoreline I slowly unwound. A kaleidoscope of butterflies fluttered (there are over 300 species in Kerala) and palm trees leaned at lazy angles. My photographer friend, John, had a camera glued to his eye. We were lost in the scene and talking stopped.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Captain Janardhanan at the helm of the Honey Dew. Photograph: John Hooper\nChildren waved, calling “hi!”, while running up to the edge of Valiyaparamba, the largest of the seven backwater islands. Stopping off to explore their villages is a fascinating part of the journey. Brahminy kites glided in a cloud-streaked sky and a zigzagging ferry was taking islanders to work and school on the mainland.\nHundreds of bamboo mussel farms pepper the waterways, arranged in square formations. Some 6,000 farmers work them, 75% of whom are women, previously employed in poorly paid paddy fields and the declining beedi industry (sales of the “poor man’s cigarette” have fallen across India). Mussel farming has given them a lifeline.\nThe Honey Dew is a partnership between local businessman Kader Porot, who built the bamboo-roof kettuvallam (houseboat), and Gul Mohammed, the social entrepreneur who introduced green-mussel cultivation to the area in 1996. Seeking a way to improve the livelihoods of Keralan coastal communities, his project grew to become India’s largest marine farming co-operative, producing 70% of India’s backwater mussels.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mussel farming employs mainly women. Photograph: John Hooper\nGul handed farm ownership directly to the workers. “The crop flourished and, because the farmers own it, they keep all the profits,” he had told me earlier. Their harvest sells for 100 rupees (£1) per kg in local markets.\nGul also runs the Oyster Opera resort , which opened in 2007, a cluster of nine basic cottages and a restaurant, on Thekkekadu, a backwater island. His vision was to show guests the area’s unique farming culture while creating jobs. The addition of the houseboat enhances the experience.\nThe boat is comfortable, with an en suite bedroom, and an open-air deck with an eating area, benches for day-trippers and space for extra beds. Mod cons, like a TV and sound system, seemed unnecessary distractions from the natural surroundings.\n“Most of our guests are locals cruising for the day; we don’t get many foreigners yet,” explained Pavithran, our chef.\nRelated: Kerala's top 10 budget beach hotels, homestays and guesthouses\nCaptain Janardhanan brought us to dock at Monkey island, where farming families were gathered. They spoke Malayalam and no English, but two women showed me how to separate the clumps of mud-soaked mussels. Women then carried them away in sacks on their heads.\nBack on board, the sunset turned the sky pink and a plaintive call to prayer sang out above the palms. A spicy scent permeated the deck and the wicker dining table filled up with fiery, small plates for dinner: karimeen and ayakura river fish, sea crab, calamari and prawns, fresh mussels were shelled and fried – spicy and succulent, unlike any I’d ever tasted.\nIn the morning, we meandered to the waterway’s northerly tip, at the mouth of the Arabian Sea. Disembarking at Valiyaparamba island, I expected a restaurant or cafe, but there were only a couple of homestays, including Kavvayi Beach House, catering to tourists.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Coconuts are another vital part of the local economy. Photograph: John Hooper\nThree coconut pickers were working in the searing midday heat. Dressed in knee-length lungis , the traditional male sarong, they deftly climbed trees using coir disks as grips and hacked off fruits which thudded to the ground. The coconut husk is turned into coir fibre which can made into everything from matting to brushes to ropes for mussel farming.\nAt sunset, we sat on the island’s beach, its sand scattered with plastic, glass bottles and abandoned shoes. Villagers paddled in the shallows, teenage boys raced and girls asked us for selfies. We joined in for a while, before retreating back onboard.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The backwaters are perfect for those seeking peace and quiet. Photograph: John Hooper\nThe last morning we cruised to the backwaters’ southerly end. It was the prettiest stretch, dotted with uninhabited islets and mangrove patches. The trip ended at Oyster Opera resort. We ventured into the nearby village, home to a Hindu temple and small coir factory, where communist flags flew proudly. Women gathered on porches and invited us for tea, while farmers ploughing the land stopped to talk.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Oyster Opera Resort Photograph: Oyster Opera Resort\nRelated: Goa: time to ditch the beach and head inland\nThroughout our stay, no one asked for money or tried any hard-sell tourist techniques. Partly, it’s because this area is off the beaten tourist track. It is also a fairly prosperous pocket of India, bolstered not just by abundant crops like mussels and coconuts, but also by wages sent home from Keralites working in the Gulf states.\nTourism will expand with the arrival of a new international airport at nearby Kannur in mid-2016. But for now, at least, farming and fishing drive the economy and it remains a place serene enough to quiet the busiest of minds – even mine.\n• The trip was provided by Incredible India, ( incredibleindia.org ).
