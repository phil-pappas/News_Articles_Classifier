(Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection) By Mary Forgione Royal Caribbean International \nThe Viking Star took the top spot as the best new cruise ship of 2015 in a recent ranking from the editors at Cruise Critic. The lavish SS Maria Theresa won the same No. 1 place for river cruise ships. \nCruise Critic tapped its editors (not its readers), who sail regularly, to compile a best-of list with 25 categories. They selected cruise lines that are best for families, best for entertainment, best for romance, well, you get the idea. \nHere are some of the highlights of the Cruise Critic 2015 Editors' Picks Awards. Best new ocean cruise ship (Viking Ocean Cruises) \nThe Viking Star , the river cruise company's first venture into ocean cruises, has been a hit. It debuted this year as what Cruise Critic calls \"a boutique hotel, homey and comfortable after a long day exploring in port.\" (Viking Ocean Cruises) \nThe design of the 928-passenger ship features al fresco restaurants, a Nordic-style spa area with snow room, two pools and a two-story Explorers club. (Viking Ocean Cruises) \nEvery stateroom has a veranda and king-sized bed as well as free wi-fi. There are five categories of rooms to choose from, including two different suites. Best new river cruise ship (Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection) \nThe luxury of the Habsburgs takes to the waters on the SS Maria Theresa from Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection. Everything about the ship is baroque on a grand scale, including the portrait of its namesake ruler in the atrium and the 22-carat gold leaf Habsburg coronets and Murano glass chandelier. (Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection) \nThe ship has just 75 staterooms. It's the third in Uniworld's fleet, sister ship to the Catharine and the Antoinette. Best inside cabins (Disney Cruise Line) \nThe \" magical portholes \" on the Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy made them a shoo-in for this category. Even though you have no window on the sea, the faux porthole provides you with live video of the world outside -- with a view that corresponds with the location of your stateroom. For fun, you might see some Disney creatures floating by too. Best standard cabins (MSC Cruises) \nMSC Cruises ' ships don't have the biggest standard staterooms but they are \"well-appointed and beautifully decorated,\" Cruise Critic says. After all, this is the line with Swarovski crystal staircases and gold-leaf mosaics. MSC has 13 ships in its fleet. Best river cruise ship cabin (Avalon Waterways) \nAvalon Waterways gets high marks for the suites that offer panoramic views. In these rooms, beds face out onto the river. And with wall-to-wall windows that slide open, you don't have to budge to watch the scenery go by. Best for families (Royal Caribbean International) \nThere's a lot going on for kids and families on Royal Caribbean International 's ships these days. You can hop into a bumper car, go skydiving in a simulator, play basketball or go roller-skating. There are options for kids of all ages, Cruise Critic points out, from nurseries to video games for teens. Best value for money Carnival Liberty (Andy Newman / Carnival Cruise Lines) \nCruise Critic picks Carnival Cruise Lines as the line that's \"easier on the wallet, yet still delivers a great vacation.\" It's the world's largest cruise line (based on number of passengers it carries) and often has sales and fares that can be as low as $75 per person per day. It's the short three- and four-night trips, mostly from Miami to the Caribbean, that make cruising affordable for many. Carnival Ecstacy (Lynne Sladky / Associated Press) Other notable picks \nBest dining: Celebrity Cruises for ocean cruise ships, AmaWaterways for river cruise ships.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:25:14.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
