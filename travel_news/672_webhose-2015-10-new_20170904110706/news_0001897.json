The Parks, Recreation and Travel Commission confirmed the Governor’s recommendation in a vote Thursday morning. \nGovernor Hutchinson issued the following statement on Kane Webb: \n“I’ve known Kane for almost 20 years, and I’ve gotten to know him especially well since he joined our team. He has a deep and abiding passion for Arkansas. He’s written about more people, places and events in this state than I can count, and he understands how important parks and tourism are to Arkansans and its economic importance to our state. \nHe’s an outstanding communicator, and I’m grateful for the work he’s done as one of my senior advisors. While we’ll miss him in the Governor’s office, I cannot think of a better person to lead our state’s Parks and Tourism Department.” \nMore on Webb: \nKane Webb, 51, is an Arkansas native with deep roots in the state. Born in Hot Springs and raised in Little Rock, Webb spent some 30 years in journalism and communications before joining Governor Hutchinson’s team during the transition. He got his professional start as a sportswriter for the former Arkansas Democrat. \nOver the years, he has served as the top editor at several publications, including Arkansas Life and Louisville magazine, and has won state, regional and national awards for his writing. As a senior advisor to Governor Hutchinson, Webb has been responsible for the Governor’s written material, served as a communications aide, and worked on special projects such as the transition of the Department of Health’s in-home care program to the private sector.
