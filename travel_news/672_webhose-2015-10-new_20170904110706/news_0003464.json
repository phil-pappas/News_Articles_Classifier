Interest-free days on purchases: Up to 44 Interest rate on cash advances: N/A International transaction fee: 3.0% Minimum income requirement: $40,000 p.a. Minimum credit limit: $2,000 Earning points for free flights: 4/5\nPocket an easy 5,000 bonus points when first using your card, an extra 2,500 points on your first Qantas transaction and a further 22,500 bonus points on spending at least $500 in the first three months for an easy kick-start of 30,000 Qantas frequent flyer points.\nThat's in addition to the points you'd normally earn per dollar spent, and more than enough for a free one-way upgrade from flexible economy or premium economy to business class between Sydney and Hong Kong, or a return business class upgrade between Brisbane and Melbourne from the cheapest economy tickets.\nAirport lounge access: 3/5 Your first Qantas spend doesn't just trigger bonus points, you'll also be sent two complimentary Qantas Club invitations to use on the journey and two more every year thereafter – valid in any domestic Qantas Club lounge or international Qantas business class lounge, excluding in Los Angeles.\nStop by the Qantas Singapore Lounge with one of your free Qantas Club passes On flights within the US, there's also the option to pay US$50 per visit for access to the American Express Centurion Lounges at airports such as New York (LaGuardia), Dallas/Fort Worth and San Francisco, although access to the American Express Sydney Airport lounge isn't included and can't be bought.\nFree international travel insurance: 5/5 Use your Qantas American Express Premium card to pay for your flights and AMEX's free domestic and international travel insurance has you covered on trips of up to 62 days and up to a maximum of 120 total travel days per year.\nThat's a noticeable step above most other credit cards which only provide travel insurance on international jaunts and a subset of coverage on domestic itineraries.\nQantas American Express Premium card: our verdict On first glance, the Qantas American Express Premium card isn't the greatest for earning frequent flyer points, as the fee-free Qantas AMEX Discovery card actually earns twice the number of points per dollar with utilities, insurance providers and government bodies.\nThe similarly-priced NAB Qantas Rewards Premium cards also provide a higher everyday earning rate of 1.5/$1 and a backup Visa at no extra cost to use where AMEX isn't accepted, but is trumped by AMEX's own Premium card on both supermarket and petrol station spend, where you'll earn up to two points per $1.\nYou'll also find no points capping on the Qantas American Express Premium card, so you're free to spend as much as you can afford to repay while earning points on the lot – and when mixed with the cool 30,000-point welcome bonus could have you well on your way to your next free flight or upgrade.\nAlso read: Qantas American Express Ultimate credit card review\nFollow Chris Chamberlin Chris lives by the motto that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, a great latte, an opera ticket and a glass of wine!\nFollow @ausbt on @MusoJournoChris\nGoogle+: Chris Chamberlin Share this Review have ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://chrischamberlin.com.au/follow-on-google-plus/?rel=author", "http://twitter.com/#!/MusoJournoChris", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt", "https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=400x300|640x480|620x480&iu=/5478219/Video&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url="], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:59:00.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
