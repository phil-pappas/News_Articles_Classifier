This partnership makes Inntopia the new provider of the e-commerce platform for Colonial Williamsburg’s lodging and packages, including event tickets, recreation activities, and online retail. \nThe Inntopia partnership is part of an overall sales and marketing initiative for Colonial Williamsburg. “This will enable Colonial Williamsburg to provide a single platform for our online guests,” said Joe Cawley, Colonial Williamsburg’s vice president of Information Technology. “We wanted a reservation system that offered the capacity to combine our varied accommodation choices with the wide array of activities, events, recreation, dining, and shopping opportunities. Inntopia has provided an intuitive yet robust system that will allow our guests to go online and book their complete Colonial Williamsburg experience.” \nThe Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, located in Williamsburg, Virginia is a private, non-profit educational organization responsible for the restoration, preservation, and interpretation of the 18th Century capital of the Colony of Virginia. The Foundation’s wholly-owned, for-profit subsidiary, the Colonial Williamsburg Company, manages one of the nation’s most dynamic hospitality enterprises, featuring four hotels, eleven restaurants, and forty-five holes of golf. Profits from the activities of the Colonial Williamsburg Company support the Foundation’s educational activities. \nThe partnership with Colonial Williamsburg is Inntopia’s first with a major attractions resort and will be a catalyst for movement into new vertical markets. The project includes multiple areas of development, such as a new interface with OmniTicket, one of the most widely used POS systems in the attractions industry world-wide. “We are very excited about this new partnership,” stated Trevor Crist, Founder and CEO of Inntopia. “We are a great fit with Colonial’s resort community to help them deliver their guests a complete vacation experience. We appreciate the opportunity that this partnership provides for our ever-expanding company and we expect that this will be the first of many endeavours into the attractions industry.” \nInntopia provides the leading suite of advanced reservation solutions in the destination industry, with a continuously evolving platform, using over 15 years of measurable results and feedback from industry leading partners.
