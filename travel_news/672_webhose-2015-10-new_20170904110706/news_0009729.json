The change will be effective with the opening of trading on Thursday, October 15. The index change was prompted by the pending acquisition of Con-way by XPO Logistics Inc. . This change will increase the weighting of airlines in the index, reflecting the larger total market capitalization of companies in that sub industry group relative to the trucking sub-industry group.\nAmerican Airlines Group, headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, is the holding company for American Airlines and US Airways.\nThe change won’t cause any disruption in the level of the Indices. The divisor used to calculate the Indices from their components’ prices on their respective home exchanges will be changed prior to the opening on October 15. This procedure prevents any distortion in the indices’ reflection of the portion of the U.S. stock market they are designed to measure.\nSource:- American Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:03:42.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
