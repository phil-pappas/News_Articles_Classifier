PUBLISHED: 00:00, Tue, Oct 20, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:24, Tue, Oct 20, 2015 PH Thames Clipper boats offer hop-on hop-off day cruises Although new Oyster card pay-as-you-go readers at the piers along the Thames will make them even more attractive to commuters, outside rush hours they are perfect for hop on-hop off day cruises. Thames Clippers boats are also used to ferry cruise passengers from terminals at Tilbury and Greenwich, with plans to extend this service when the new Enderby Wharf cruise terminal is opened in 2017. The 150-passenger twin catamarans Galaxy Clipper and Neptune Clipper will provide state-of-the-art speed and comfort on the increasingly popular routes. \"We carry a lot of tourists who do not necessarily have much time and want to pack a lot in and this is the ideal option for them,\" says Sean Collins, CEO and Co-founder of MBNA Thames Clippers. River Rover tickets cost £14.70 a day if bought online, or £32.50 for online family tickets (two adults and three children). Passengers can jump on at South Bank's London Eye and hop on and off all the way to the O2 stadium, before returning to South Bank. We have focused on the passenger experience and the amount of window space you have got Sean Collins, CEO and Co-founder of MBNA Thames Clippers \"They can get off at their leisure and we have a tour app so people can download that and know what buildings they are passing and it will give them an insight as to what attractions are in that area,\" says Sean, who is the third generation of his family to work on the Thames. \"We have focused on the passenger experience and the amount of window space you have got,\" says Sean. \"They are great vessels to see the sights of London and travel in comfort.\" PH Thames Clipper river buses are less than a decade old Thames Clipper river buses are all less than 10 years old and have a mix of indoor and outdoor seats, with a kiosk selling hot drinks, light lunches and alcohol. Cruise companies such as Carnival, Seabourn and Windstar have used the boats to take passengers from Tilbury cruise terminal to central London. \"When Viking Star made its debut voyage to London this year, and its subsequent visit, it moored at Greenwich and we took passengers to the key attractions, such as the Tower of London, London Eye and Westminster,\" says Sean. \"We already have more bookings for 2016 from Tilbury cruise terminal and we hope to work with Enderby Wharf cruise terminal. \"We plan to take people who are going on a cruise, from central London to join their ship, or passengers into central London to see the sights.\" For details of ticket prices, routes and special discounts including admission to attractions such as Royal Observatory Greenwich and Cutty Sark, go to www.thamesclippers.com .
