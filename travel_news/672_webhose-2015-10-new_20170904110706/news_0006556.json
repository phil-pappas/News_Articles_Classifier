When its narrow streets and Georgian buildings promised the dubious thrills of cheap food, bad wine and worse behaviour. When the shambling chap in the stained suit turned out to be a world-famous artist and his pal, in designer glasses and bespoke shoes, a pimp.\nI’m torn about Soho these days. On the one hand, I’m not buying the glamorisation of the old tart-with-a-heart up winding, red-lit steps. The remaining sleaze is just that: sleazy. Sit in Russell Norman’s Spuntino (not uncoincidentally one of the architects of nouveau Soho) and watch the drug deals and hollow-eyed “girls” across the road, and it won’t make you nostalgic for a bygone age of exploitative crime. But I do miss louche streets on which you might bump into gorgeous, top-hatted Sebastian Horsley (RIP, though that is, to be honest, unlikely). Days on which you might be ejected from a shebeen for “lowering the tone”. (Prostitution and criminality were OK, apparently, but don’t even think about drunkenly singing All My Exes Live In Texas .) Hey-ho: sometimes change has to be embraced, even if Madame Jo-Jo’s has shantéd away.\nStill, it’s sad that Soho is now so sheeny-shiny: all the chains, the faux-streetfooders punting bubble tea or fast pasta, Patisserie Valerie transformed into a horrible moneymaker. Thank the gods, then, for the continuing joys of Algerian Coffee Store , Maison Bertaux , Bar Italia , Vasco & Piero’s Pavilion , the French … and Andrew Edmunds , with its lovely Georgian facade that was painted deepest sludge long before the heritage paint charts. The restaurant itself grew out of Edmunds’ antique prints business, and the whole thing makes you feel as if you’re starring in a novel by Keith Waterhouse or hanging out with George Melly . I walked past the other day and on a little blackboard was chalked “Grouse for lunch”. Even though I was en route to a perfectly lovely restaurant around the corner, I realised I wanted to be going to Andrew Edmunds instead.\nSo here I am, having missed the entrance and ended up in the kitchen by mistake. It’s unchanged, unchanging, forever with the air of an insiders’ secret society. The winelist makes my oenophile chum’s pupils dilate with lust, and we end up with an André Perret Condrieu Côteaux du Chery 2012 that, at £65, he insists is a steal. When it comes to wine, I’m usually with the writer known as The Guyliner , who says there are only three kinds: “under £9.99; over £9.99; champagne”. But this is startlingly lovely. The pal says, accurately, “ripe apricots, peaches, blossom and cream”, and I forgive him totally for the resulting bill.\nLook, I’ll level with you. I love this place, but not necessarily for its food. The menu reads like a dream, a hand-scrawled poem to traditional (dressed crab; a wonderfully wine-bar leeks vinaigrette with chopped egg; rabbit and pork rillettes with cornichons; shrimp and samphire) and modern (pluma Ibérica, that fatty shoulder cut of Pata Negra pig, though if this one’s toughness is anything to go by, it roamed the dehesa in knuckledusters). Flavours might be Franglais: Old Spot pork chop with confit potatoes, braised shallots and anchovy butter. Or Iberian: a gorgeous arroz negro, honkingly savoury with cephalopod ink and laden with tender cuttlefish; wild bass with salmorejo. Or non-denominational: a chunk of hake flanked by chard as fat and fruity as rhubarb, with the sour-salty-bitter triple-whammy from preserved lemon and green olive tapenade.\nIt’s all, apart from slightly stale bread, perfectly acceptable. But, as I’ve banged on before, restaurants are about far more than the cooking. And there’s so much to be smitten by here: the two waitresses, one young, beautiful, smiley, the other older, stern, giggly-making, both knowledgable and hospitable in a good-cop-bad-cop way; its slightly frayed, cosy (cramped?) beauty; the curious characters who inhabit the place; the legendarily generous wine markups (that Condrieu would cost hundreds in snootier gaffs, and house wines start at about 19 quid). It has a well-deserved reputation for romance, possibly because you’re basically sitting on top of each other.\nAndrew Edmunds has been around for almost 30 years, and I’m raising a glass of something expensive and recherché to the next 30.\n• Andrew Edmunds 46 Lexington Street, London W1, 020-7437 5708.
