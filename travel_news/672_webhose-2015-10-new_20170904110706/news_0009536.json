Maldives held grand celebrations in Milan to commemorate the national day with colorful cultural performances at the Expo and other important public areas of the city. Mr. Abdulla Ziyath, Managing Director of MMPRC was the head of the delegation for the Maldives national day celebrations. \nMaldives received increased interest from the visitors during and after the national day which is one of the main reasons for Maldives to cross the 100,000th visitor at the Maldives stand. \nItaly being one of the most important traditional markets to the Maldives holds great potentiality for positive growth figures.
