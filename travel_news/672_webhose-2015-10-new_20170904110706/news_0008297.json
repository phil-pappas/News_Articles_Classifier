The revolutionary mobile iPad application for manufacturers allows dealers and sales teams to process a remote sale by simply tapping on a brand, model, option or accessory to create and send a purchase order. The new program features product images and media, a Dealer Management System, Dynamic Margin calculator and a breakthrough admin command center.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279419LOGO\nWith the Photo Management Application, users can select, view and zoom into pictures of any truck product model or part available including accessories or options. Sales users can also take buyers into a customized virtual showroom.\nDealers create purchase orders automatically with The Dealer Management System. It manages sales users, lists, and signed PDF Quote: s for dealer admins to approve. Also, with the iPad system, users can create new Quote: s right in front of the customer. The operations team has immediate access to the purchase order, which includes a profit calculator securely accessed directly on the iPad app. Inputting a security code activates this feature to calculate profits and margins \"on the fly.\"\nThe Dealer Command Center gives dealers and their sales teams up-to-date photos, descriptions and pricing. This includes a full product image gallery and the ability to construct a favorites list for the most frequently sold brands and models to facilitate pre-configured Quote: s for managers and sales teams. The manufacturer admin can set up dealers, associate brands, add models and configure options. They can also set up accessories for each model, and manage options like paint and install operations. The Salesninja offers global pricing management and a robust PO system, easily handled by administrators using secured access.\nSales teams can work with clients on the iPad to browse photos for each truck model or part available by touching them. They can add to their Quote: s and receive an easily configured ready-to-sign document. If the buyer needs time to consider any part of the orderâ€¦no problem, Salesninja automatically saves the customized version.\nThe Salesninja Mobile Sales Processing app requires an iPad 2 or above while the admin portals support a PC and Chrome browser. Currently available in the United States , available in Europe in late 2015; in Asia , in 2016. Pricing updates and final Quote: signatures require Internet access, but the majority of the quoting process can be accomplished offline.\n\"Salesninja is a revolutionary product that is literally years ahead of any other sales software,\" said Bryan Taylor , Anderson Taylor , CEO. \"We are all visual when we buy, and we use our fingers to point to what we want-now with Salesninja, customers can use that same interface to create a custom product configuration.\"\nThis software solution was originally built for Miller Industries, a leading truck body builder.
