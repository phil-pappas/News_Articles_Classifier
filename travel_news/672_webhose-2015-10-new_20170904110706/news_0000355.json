The Mail on Sunday suggested the clock's hands could fall off without urgent action.\nThe Times says repairs to the Elizabeth Tower must begin as soon as possible and can't wait for the 7 billion pound ($10.8 billion) restoration of the entire Palace of Westminster that is scheduled to begin at the end of the decade.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:07:58.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
