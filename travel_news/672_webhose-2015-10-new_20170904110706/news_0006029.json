It is a duel between the Old and the New World: one tour of the great classic wine region Bordeaux and one to an emerging New World country, South Africa. Both tours are organised by award winning wine writers Britt and Per Karlsson. Full tour programs can be found here: www.bkwinetours.com.\nThe first spring wine tour on BKWine’s program takes the traveller to South Africa. It is a country that has emerged as one of the leading New World wine countries since its liberalisation of the wine sector when apartheid fell. Today South Africa produces many top world-class wines. The tour extends over nine days and takes the traveller to some of the best wine estates in the country, including meetings with the winemakers and extensive private tastings. It also includes visits of Cape Town, the Cape of Good Hope and some of the other spectacular tourist attractions in the Cape region. The tour takes place on February 26 to March 7, 2016.\nThe second spring tour goes to Bordeaux, the world’s most famous wine region. This is a four nights-three full days tour that gives the traveller a unique insight into the Bordeaux wine scene. The tour includes visits both to some of the most prestigious and exclusive chateaux, that represent the glitter of the region, as well as to top family-run wineries that are rarely possible to visit by people outside the wine industry. This tour is on April 20-24, 2016.\nBritt Karlsson, founder of BKWine, comments: “Our wine tours will give the wine enthusiast – or the wine professional – a unique insight into these wine regions. We are also award winning authors and wine journalists and thanks to that we have an exceptional network of contacts with wineries and winemakers, which opens doors otherwise shut. The travellers on our tours will experience things that are often not available to the general public.”\nBoth the BKWine spring wine tours include extensive private tastings at the numerous wineries visited as well as exclusive gourmet meals, often at the wineries and chateaux visited.
