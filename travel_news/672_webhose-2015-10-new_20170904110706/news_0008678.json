The Salam Standard helps them select hotels according to this Muslim-focused criteria – no other review portal provides such comprehensive information.” \nFadhlillah said Salam Standard could evolve into the “biggest information provider of Muslim travel content” over the next few years if more Muslim-focused travel products and services are added. \n“Our aim is to encourage hotel operators to offer more facilities for Muslim travellers, ensuring they experience their holiday of a lifetime,” he said. \nSalam Standard is being promoted as part of the Tourism Malaysia showcase at this week’s WHTS15 (October 19-21), which is expected to attract more than 6,000 halal travel industry professionals. \nSpeaking at the event, Abu Dhabi Tourism & Culture Authority (TCA Abu Dhabi) acting director general HE Jasem Al Darmaki noted that halal travel was “one of the fastest-growing sectors of global tourism” and that its value would “double within five years”. \nMalaysia is recognized as a global leader in the Muslim travel market, which Tourism Malaysia deputy director general Dato’ Abdul Khani Daud stressed held “strong potential”. \n“The introduction of Salam Standard will not only help hotels worldwide cater to the needs of this burgeoning sector, which we strongly support, but also help Muslim travelers seeking a blessed journey,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:00:31.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
