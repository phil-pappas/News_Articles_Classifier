I was happy to be able to offer that to her. I was an enthusiastic promote of that trip all summer long when my guests asked me what would be the best and coolest thing to do while in town. The boat was nice and comfortable and included and all-you-can-eat buffet. It was a great kick-off to a wonderful summer,” said one organization member. \nKenai Fjords Tours is proud of this accomplishment and strives to exceed expectations of all guests. \n\nAlaska Native owned and operated, CIRI Alaska Tourism Corporation (CATC) is the umbrella company for Alaska Heritage Tours, Kenai Fjords Tours, Kenai Fjords Wilderness Lodge, Seward Windsong Lodge, and Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:53:47.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
