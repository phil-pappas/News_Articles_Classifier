However, before you send yours off, there’s the all-important final read-through to do. So take a deep breath, have a cup of tea and make sure you've followed the dos and don'ts of writing an outstanding personal statement. • Applying to university: important Ucas deadline dates • How to write a good personal statement for university 1. Take out any corny Quote: s Those famous epithets by celebrated writers and thinkers that have “inspired” you to study the subject you have applied for will undoubtedly be your admissions officer's pet hate. It's fine to Quote: from a text or book that is relevant to your subject but don't include well-known platitudes about the human condition by Einstein. One of the most popular phrases used in 2013 was Coco Chanel’s maxim, “Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only”. So definitely don’t use that one. Using Quote: s might suggest you are relying on them to do the heavy lifting in the statement rather than using your own critical skills. 2. Drop the X Factor stories Don't be overly emotive in your statement by including sob stories about how you were inspired to study law when your friend/sister/dying grandmother suffered a terrible injustice. Tutors will find X Factor-style tales inappropriate and won't be impressed. It's better to find other reasons to explain why you want to take the course (for example, a new scientific discovery, an interesting study, a new book), and expand on that. This will show you've done your research and that your interests have developed over time, rather than been sparked by a fantastical tale that may appear, to them, to be made up.

If you reach the interview stage it's very likely you'll be asked about your personal statement. You don't want to have to start reading the complete works of Tolstoy a fortnight before your interview. Same goes for issues you have professed a specialist interest in; if you're asked in an interview about your views on the refugee crisis and you don't have anything to say, expect an uncomfortable ride. 4. Have a snappy start and finish Do have an engaging first and last line to keep the admissions officer interested throughout. One good way to approach the opening is to identify a connection between two things you've read or heard about your subject that somehow have illuminated a new idea or area of interest to you. It might be that a poem you’ve read got you thinking about a book with similar themes, or perhaps a recent story in the news has parallels with a historical event. Do end on a positive note that conveys enthusiasm but isn't insincere. This is a chance to be yourself: think about why you really are looking forward to studying the subject you have applied for and write it down. Photo: Juice/Alamy 5. Expand on transferable skills Balancing the inclusion of your extracurricular interests with more specific topics to do with your subject is difficult. If in doubt about whether something you do outside of school is relevant, abide by this advice: include the activity if the skills you acquired are transferable to your subject. If they're not, don't . If you’re an amateur astronomer and you're applying to a Physics course, it might well be relevant. If you’re a keen heli-skier, that may not be worth mentioning in your Classics application. 6. Avoid claiming to be an expert While it is advisable to show you are engaged with the world around you (as far as it is related to your subject), it will annoy admissions officers if you declare you have the perfect solution to the Brexit question, if only David Cameron would listen to you. Arrogance is unattractive. Instead, show you are aware of the various sides of an argument and take your own stance without arguing it is superior. 7. Never ever plagiarise Hopefully you won’t have actually downloaded a personal statement verbatim from the web. Ucas has fraud detection software to identify cheating and warns of “serious consequences” if you are caught. Be careful about how closely you consult with friends; give each other advice but don't take too many suggestions from other people – you want your own ideas to stand out, not anyone else’s.
