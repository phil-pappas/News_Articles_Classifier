There are times in your life when others nurture and nourish your body, but for most of your life the task is yours. \nAn unborn baby must rely on its mother to provide nutrients to grow and develop. Infants and toddlers will do the same, but as the child ages he or she begins to form likes, dislikes, and opinions on what food to eat. They also begin to decide when they want to eat and as years pass, nourishing their body becomes their responsibility. \nThe food you eat will play a vital part in your health starting at an early age. I believe you must, without obsessing, think of food first and plan your eating. Think of how food can affect your relationships, your career, a vacation, or your daily schedule. \nRelationships: \nThere is a saying, \"Birds of a feather flock together.\" People tend to be attracted to others who like the same. If you are a poor eater, you may find your friends are, too. If you eat healthier and are committed to nourishing your body, you may not want to take part in poor eating episodes. I've had clients who changed their poor eating styles to a nourishing one. Often they find that they severed ties with people they thought were friends, but in reality they only had poor eating habits in common. The new relationships they form are deeper and more socially satisfying because they find other common interests, and the relationship is not based on eating. \nCareer: \nEating must be a priority in the work day regardless of career choice. With each profession there are eating challenges and you may either fall into the traps of the challenges or you can find a strategy that works for you. Many of my clients claim that they were healthier at the start of their careers than they are in subsequent years. Plan your eating into your work schedule. Never convince yourself that you are too busy to eat, and don't join in with unhealthy habits of co-workers. Nourishing your body is as important to your success as the next big opportunity. \nVacation: \nWhile traveling you may feel that this is the time to eat the rich or fatty food you usually avoid. If are not accustomed to this type of food, your body will revolt with stomach pains, headaches, or diarrhea. The food may also make you uncomfortable and lazy, and might destroy your vacation. For a more enjoyable time, plan and eat food your body will tolerate and is a healthier option, while you add in other items sparingly. \nDaily Schedule: \nYour daily schedule is the most important of all. Once you've learned to nourish your body on a daily basis, and eat food that gives you energy while it preserves good health, it won't matter who you are with, where you are, what your schedule is, or where you are traveling. You will be an individual who thinks of food first and plans to eat. It will be normal for you to include items from all food groups each day. Grabbing anything full of fat or sugar will never cross your mind. Nourishing your body will be an everyday habit --regardless of circumstances. \nWhen you eat well, you live well. When you eat healthy, you are healthy. When you nourish your body, you nourish your mind. \nFollow Margaret Marshall on Twitter: www.twitter.com/MarshallM01 More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:59:25.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
