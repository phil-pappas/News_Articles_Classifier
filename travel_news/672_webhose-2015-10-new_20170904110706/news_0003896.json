The new facility, which will replace the current Silks Restaurant, will cater for up to 300 guests on any raceday, as well as being able to host conferences and events on non racedays throughout the year. It will offer racegoers the opportunity to dine in full view of the track for the first time at the Staffordshire track. \nWork will begin in January 2016 and continue throughout February, with the new restaurant in operation for the Betfred Midlands Grand National Meeting on Saturday 19 March. During the construction of the new restaurant racegoers will still be able to use the Hoops Restaurant. Existing viewing seats that will be removed for the development will be relocated to an alternative location to minimise inconvenience for racegoers. This investment follows £70,000 worth of drainage works in August, to improve the racing surface at the track which will offer greater consistency of the Going and minimise the risk of abandonment. Executive Director of Uttoxeter Racecourse, David MacDonald, said: \"We are delighted to be going ahead with this significant development. It will offer our racegoers the opportunity to experience a premier dining facility while enjoying the racing action for the first time at Uttoxeter. \"Equally, we will be able to offer the facility year round for conferences and events for between 350 and 400 people and will be one of the largest premium venues in Staffordshire. We are very much looking forward to having everything in place for our biggest meeting of the year, the Betfred Midlands National on Saturday 19 March.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:31:30.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
