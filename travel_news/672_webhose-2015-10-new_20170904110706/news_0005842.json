We appreciate all of the inquiries, questions, and ideas. We strive to answer each and every one. As requested, there are more places to camp during the colder months. One does not have to be a Snowbird to enjoy fall and winter camping all year long. When discussing camping in any form of travel possible, we were asked to add our local motorcycle campers. Many hook up a trailer to their motorcycle and travel in the wind. As lifelong riders, we salute you. To all; remember to share the road and drive or ride safely. Winter camping can be as much of an adventure as you want it to be. From the mountains to our beautiful beaches, winter is truly a magical time to enjoy what California has to offer. In many places you can camp just as comfortably in January as you can in May. I will briefly list a few spots, as there are so many. Mesquite Springs in Death Valley National Monument is at a 1,800 foot elevation. It is a great place for star watching and the ever present coyote concerts late at night. Moabi Regional Park in the Colorado River Valley is at an elevation of 450 feet above sea level. I-40 is just a couple of miles away, so access is a piece of cake. Granted, this is a mostly paved camping area. If you want to get away and have little set up, this may be your ticket for a relaxing weekend. Corn Springs sits in an area of The Chuckwalla Mountains in a transition between the high and low deserts. The fall and winter temperatures seem to be a bit warmer than those in The Mojave Desert this time of year. This is geared for tent campers or off road rv access and the road can be a bit rough at times. Now, let’s explore a few places along Interstate 395. Ahh, The Alabama Hills just outside of Lone Pine are a most excellent and scenic place to just park and enjoy the view. With Mt. Whitney in the background, Russ and Lori suggest only temperature tolerant campers attempt this area in the winter. What is disturbing for one is an adventure for another. The valley floor catches the cold air rushing off of these gorgeous mountains. If you can handle that, the sunrise and sunset views are well worth it. Bishop ris only another 60 miles north of Lone Pine on Interstate 395. We suggest that be the limit for northbound travel in an RV for the late fall and early winter months. The weather can change very quickly. Leaving north out of Bishop is a very steep grade and the roads can be deceivingly safe looking. Why? ICE…. Icy roads with black ice can surprise the best of drivers. Even at snail pace speed, ice on the road can easily cause an RV to lose control. Camp in Bishop. There are plenty of things to do in the area and a southbound ride home is easy and safe. Hey beach people, we didn’t forget you! All California beach campgrounds are worth the ride. Winter camping is usually less crowded, and the ocean is as beautiful as always. This is a great time to take a ride up the coast and discover what winter beach camping is all about. Make reservations to be sure. There are virtually dozens of desert camping spots, many on Bureau of Land Management lands that are open to campers all year long. One thing is for certain. Sometimes you didn’t know that you really needed that weekend getaway, until you arrive home from it. When you get home refreshed, you are better equipped and ready to rock and roll with whatever life or work demands await you. So, Let’s Get Rollin’!
