His pictures of the urban landscape recently were compiled in a book called “My City Charleston.” And his portraits include a veritable who’s-who of Holy City personalities. During the last year, Alterman has turned his attention to one corner of the city, a neighborhood quickly changing because of population growth, student activity, a vibrant real estate market and increasing development. For decades, the East Side has been home to mostly low-income, mostly black residents. It’s a bastion of the mid-20th century, and for many years it has seemed stuck in time. But now it has become unstuck. Now whites are moving in, investors are snapping up old properties to renovate them, then “flip” them. Young people are buying fixer-uppers. From the south, gentrified Charleston applies its pressure on the East Side neighborhood. From the north, commercial activity and new construction exerts more pressure. Change is inexorable. Alterman, ever concerned with the tensions that contribute to transformation, with the dynamism of his hometown, set out to stop time, if just for a moment. He has recently concluded a six-month project he calls “East Siders Matter,” producing a series of more than 40 black-and-white, large-format photographs. They measure 40 inches by 50 inches, and more than 30 are hung along the fence on Columbus Street at America Street. “My process was to ask passersby to pose for me in a white cube, basically a portable photo booth,” Alterman explained in an email. “I worked on Saturdays and Sundays, on and off for six months. With the help of friends, I set up in vacant lots or on sidewalks. We would move frequently to take advantage of the changing sunlight. I asked questions about their lives.” The result is a collection of intimate, revealing portraits, at once warm and stark, which transform the idea of the East Side into flesh and blood. “With so much change going on in our city, it is easy to forget or ignore the people living there,” Alterman wrote. “I hope this project will acknowledge and preserve a point in time of this diverse and rapidly developing community.” After setting up his photo booth, Alterman would ask people if they lived in the neighborhood, then he would explain what he was up to and invite residents to participate in the project. “People ranged in age from 5 to 85,” he wrote. “Their personalities and stories were as diverse. Some had lived on the same street for generations and others for only a few years, but I saw a profound sense of community.” Initially, he imaged a gallery exhibition but decided that these portraits would be better shown in the environment where they were made. The large prints have been weatherproofed. They will remain on view until Nov. 1. Reach Adam Parker at (843) 937-5902. Follow him at facebook.com/aparkerwriter .
