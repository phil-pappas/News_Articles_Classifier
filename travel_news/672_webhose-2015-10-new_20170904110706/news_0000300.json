The GCC and Europe have traditionally been Sharjah’s main tourism source markets, followed by Russia. However, the number of tourists from Russia has dropped in the UAE in the last 18 months, mainly due to the weaker Russian rouble. \nAl Midfa expects the Russian market to improve in the current quarter. The SCTDA was on a four-day roadshow that wrapped up two weeks ago to promote tourism in the emirate in Russia, Armenia, Georgia and Kazakhstan. \nThe authority brought together its partners in the public and private sectors at the conference to present the latest tourism projects in the emirate. It said that it will need to work together with its partners to achieve its goal of attracting 10 million tourists by 2021, from 5.6 million in 2014. \nInnovative solutions \nThe SCTDA listed four key areas of focus to achieve the Sharjah Tourism Vision 2021, which was announced last April. These include promoting the emirate as an ideal family tourism destination by offering packages and offers to families, and improving tourists’ experience by offering “ innovative solutions”, such as touch screens in hotels and virtual reality. The two other areas are “enhancing efficiencies” in the tourism sector through partnership with other entities and positioning the emirate as an international cultural hub. This year, Sharjah is the “Arab Tourism Capital” and last year was named the “Islamic Cultural Capital”. \nSharjah will need to boost hotel room numbers from around 10,000 today to 16,000 by 2021 to accommodate the anticipated increase in visitors. Last year, two million guests stayed in the emirate’s hotels and hotel apartments. \nAl Midfa said that hotel guests in the emirate have been growing by 7-10 per cent annually in the last few years, but expects that rate to drop to below 7 per cent this year due economic problems in some of its tourism source markets, such as Russia. \nBy Sarah Algethami Staff Reporter \nGulf News 2015.
