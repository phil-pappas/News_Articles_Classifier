The fair will get underway at the Shanghai New International Exhibition Center (SNIEC) , Shanghai, China on 1-3 December, 2015 , and will attract manufacturers and buyers from the railway, urban transit and relevant transportation industries.\nThe booming railway industry market offers huge business opportunities\nChina's railway industry has sped up since the beginning of the twenty-first century and has achieved profound success, especially in high-speed railways and urban rail transit. According to the official statistics, China hit a new record with the construction of 8,427 kilometres of new railways and the mileage of railways in operation totalled 112,000 kilometres in 2014. The current mileage of high-speed railways in operation has reigned as the world's top mileage with 116,000 kilometres. China's 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-16) indicates that the operational mileage of railways will increase by 8,000 kilometres, reaching 120,000 kilometres in 2015, while high-speed railways will increase by 2,000 kilometres, reaching 18,000 kilometres. With the rapid growth in the construction scale of both ordinary and high-speed railways, it is estimated that China will continue to be the largest railway market in the coming five years. The booming railway industry will boost the synergetic development of related industries.\nThe global economy has been slumping in recent years. Defying this global trend, the international railway market is maintaining rapid growth. The export market for China's rail equipment is vast. According to a report from SCI Verkehr, the global manufacture of railway and transit equipment has increased by 2.4% year on year. It is estimated that the industrial production will surpass US$190 billion in 2018. According to data from the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China , China exported US$3.74 billion worth of railway vehicles last year, surging by 19.3 percent year on year. The implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative will be a strong driver of the export of China's railway equipment in the coming years.\nProfessional organisers provide efficient trading platform\nCRTEC 2015 is organized by UBM Asia, the largest trade show organizer in Asia , and is fully supported by the Industry Specialist, CCCME, who is the only nationwide Chamber of Commerce in the machinery and electronics sector. With UBM Asia's global network, huge data base and expertise in the exhibition industry, plus CCCME's abundant resources in the rail industry, the exhibitors will be connected to highly targeted visitors and business partners through the business matching activities provided by the organisers. The exhibition will be an excellent platform for trade professionals to learn, engage and network with the decision-makers and experts of the industry.\nStrong support from industry leaders and elites\nAs a high-profile rail exhibition and conference of its kind in the region, CRTEC has received resounding feedback upon its launch. Leading companies of the industry, such as Beijing National Railway Research & Design Institute of Signal & Communication Group Co, Ltd, International Department of China Railway No.2 Engineering Group Co, Ltd, CRRC Corporation Limited, Zhejiang Tiantie Industry Co, Ltd, NORINCO International Cooperation Ltd, etc. will be exhibiting at the Fair. The scope of the exhibits covers all sectors of the whole industry chain, including:\nRailway technology Infrastructure facilities and services Tunnel construction Public transport equipment and services Vehicle interior and environmental design Rail operations and services Investment consulting and financing Advanced equipment, cutting-edge technology, updated solutions and creative management ideas will be presented during the three-day event.\nThe Fair has also received positive feedback from VIP visitors from all over the world, including Brazil , Malaysia and the UK. The leading railway associations -- ABIFER and Latin American Association of Railroads (ALAF) in Brazil , have registered for their attendance. On 19 May, 2015 , China and Brazil signed an agreement on a feasibility study of a 4,000-km-long railway linking Brazil's Atlantic coast to Peru's Pacific coast. It is the first railway construction project that will connect the Pacific and the Atlantic. The railway is expected to boost local economic development, improve infrastructure and benefit the export of China's railway equipment and technology, as well as boost Chinese-Latin American trade. Tailor-made business matching activities for the selected exhibitors and VIP visitors will build a bridge between the Chinese and overseas railway companies.\nExciting special events\nVIP Dialogues The VIP Dialogues are an excellent opportunity to share knowledge, technology and management experience with operators, experts and decision-makers in the relevant government departments.\nPost-show Visit The tailor-made Post-show Visit will be arranged by the Organiser for the overseas VIP visitors to visit designated plants, operators and industrial parks in China . The visit is an in-depth exchange program between the local operators and manufacturers in China and the industry experts from overseas.\nHigh-profile Railway Conference A series of fringe conferences dedicated to the rail and transit industries will be held alongside CRTEC and will focus on the hot topics in the industry.
