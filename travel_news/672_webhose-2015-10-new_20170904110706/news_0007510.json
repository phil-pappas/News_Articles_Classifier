The rand fell 1.81% versus the dollar, 1.53% against the pound and 0.99% versus the euro, and was the worst-performing currency among its emerging-market peers,\" Barclays said.\nAt 3.50pm the rand was at R13.5777 against the dollar from its previous close of R13.6437.\nThe local currency was at R14.9561 against the euro from R15.0157 and at R20.8214 against the pound from a previous close of R20.8805.\nThe euro was at $1.1015 from a previous close of $1.1008.\nThe focus of global markets this week is Wednesday’s US Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Market consensus is that rates will be kept on hold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:14:50.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
