What better vacation is there than an air tour at the Grand Canyon? These tours depart from Tusayan in Arizona, and Boulder City and Las Vegas in Nevada. Flights are operational as usual on Halloween, in fact, the air tours operate every day except Christmas Day. High demand is expected for the end of October, though, so make sure you book as soon as possible. Las Vegas flights The helicopter tours that operate out of Vegas and Boulder City in Nevada all fly to the West Rim of the Grand Canyon. There are several fun things to do at the West Rim such as taking a boat ride on the Colorado River and seeing the Grand Canyon Skywalk. Of course, you'll have to take a landing tour if you want to add some fun adventures to your flight package. The West   Canyon where you can land at the top of the rim, or at the riverside below. The air tour is a lot of fun in its own right, even if you don't add on a landing adventure. You will fly out past Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam, before making a scenic pass over of the Canyon. The best way to see the Grand Canyon is from a chopper, and you'll have plenty of beautiful sights to see. If you can work it into your budget, I do recommend taking a landing tour. Landing tours travel the same route as the air-only tours, with the added bonus that you can land at the Canyon. Plus, walking out on the Skywalk and standing 4000 feet above the Canyon floor on a plate of glass is an experience you don't want to miss. While the view from the air is amazing, you'll also be amazed at the view of the Canyon walls while floating along the Colorado River when you add on a boat tour. You can even combine different packages to make sure that you experience everything that there is to see. One of the bottom landing tours includes a Champagne picnic so you can toast your thrilling descent to the Canyon floor and the flight of a lifetime. South Rim Tours Even though you can't take a landing tour at the South Rim, there are plenty of other reasons to go there. One of the South Rim tours flies you over to the North Rim. The North Rim is interesting because it is so remote, in fact, it is so remote that it is one of the least traveled sections of the Grand Canyon National Park. Other helicopters that fly here offer a longer flight that lets you see the remote North Rim as well as all of the park over to the eastern boundary. This second option is so extensive that you will see three quarters of the National Park. For just a little extra, it is easy to recommend the second option. Types of Helicopters Different types of helicopters are used on the various tours, and if you want the best ride, you should book a deluxe tour. Deluxe tours ensure that you will fly in an EcoStar 130 helicopter. This chopper is roomier and has comfortable seats, plus it is quieter and best of all, it has a huge wraparound window that gives you panoramic, unobstructed views. As an added bonus, the deluxe tours that take off from Vegas depart right from the Las Vegas Strip and pick you up at your hotel in a limo. Compare that to taking a basic tour, which requires a shuttle bus ride to Boulder City where your chopper departs. Paying more to upgrade to a deluxe tour means you will receive the most convenience, comfort, and views on your tour. So if it fits in your budget, be sure to book a deluxe tour. However, don't worry if you want to book a basic tour instead, even a basic tour of the Grand Canyon is a fabulous experience. Conclusion Halloween is an exciting time of year, but yours could be even more special with if you see the canyon by helicopter. When you book an air tour, you can add on different fun adventures to create the perfect getaway for your schedule and budget. Also, book your tour now, or it might be sold out if you wait. Book your tour online too, so you can use the low Internet rate and get a great deal on a fun holiday adventure. \n  Canyon helicopter tours and recommends going here for a list of the best at the lowest prices possible: http://grandcanyonhelicopter.org/best-grand-canyon-helicopter-tours.html   16   0  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:01:21.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
