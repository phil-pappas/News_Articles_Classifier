Other tours are fun too, but nothing can compare to soaring over the massive canyon in a chopper. These tours operate all year long and they offer several options, so you can put together a package you're sure to enjoy.Get Going!The helicopter tours take off from the airport in Tusayan, Arizona near the South Rim and from airfields around Las Vegas. You can take air-only and ground tours at both of the rims, but the only place your helicopter can fly below the rim and land on the canyon floor is at the West Rim, and you need to part from Vegas to go there. Flying into the canyon is prohibited by the National Park Services at the South Rim due to noise restrictions.Vegas DeparturesAs soon as you take flight on one of the Vegas tours, you'll be treated to scenic views. You'll get an aerial view of scenic Lake Mead, which is the sixteenth largest man-made lake as well as beautiful views of the Colorado River and the canyon itself. If you book a landing tour, you can set down on top of the rim, at the bottom of the canyon, or do a combination of both. One tour even lands for a Champagne toast and picnic on the ground.Another fun thing to do at the canyon is add on an eleven mile floating trip down the Colorado River. Your rafting journey begins below the towering Hoover Dam and takes you through the dark volcanic rock walls of Black Canyon. The raft ends its journey in the tranquil waters of Willow Beach. The oasis at Willow Beach is a great place to swim and cool off from the summer heat. This river tour takes off early in the morning and runs once each day.South Rim ViewsThe South Rim is known for its spectacular panoramic views from the air. Two options are available, depending on how much time or money you want to spend. One flight lasts about 30 minutes and flies over the North Rim and circles back. Then there is a longer, 50-minute flight that goes to the North Rim and over to the eastern border, so you see about 75 percent of the whole Grand Canyon National Park.You can also add in a land tour, for instance, you can add a Jeep excursion of the park along with the 30-minute helicopter tour. This combo visits the most recognized stops in the park and gives the best canyon experience. One beautiful stop to make is at Mather Point where you can gaze out on miles of colorful canyon spread out before you. The path the Colorado has cut through the canyon will be on full display at Yavapai Point. You can also take a break at Grand Canyon Village, a century-old site full of spectacular views, shops, and historic buildings. Overall, this is a fantastic tour of the South Rim that lets you see it all.Which Way To Fly?The basic or deluxe tour type depends on the helicopter used. Basic tours fly on older, traditional Bell Ranger helicopters or A Stars. While they are great for flying, they aren't very good at controlling the noise or climate in the cabin. Deluxe flights however, fly on the EcoStar 130 aircraft that are much roomier, plus they have excellent climate control and improved seating. In addition, the EcoStar is a lot quieter and gives you a smoother ride. Perhaps the best benefit of all is the huge panoramic windshield that offers the best viewing possible from the air.Lots Of Enticing OptionsYou can see there is no shortage of options when it comes to choosing a helicopter tour of the Grand Canyon. Hopefully, this article has narrowed the choices down. Deluxe flights are the way to go since they come with great perks and offer a more comfortable flight. I personally recommend the Las Vegas Champagne picnic tour or the South Rim tour that includes access to a Jeep tour. No matter what tour you pick, be sure to book it online well in advance so it isn't sold out when you're ready to go.
