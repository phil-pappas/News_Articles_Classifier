The rain continued and it was decided that it would not be safe to open the new bridge as planned this morning.\nInstead, the old bridge across the A47 was kept open. Work on the new bridge will resume as soon as the weather allows. The aim is to open the new bridge, and close the old, overnight tonight if possible. Traffic would then start using the new bridge tomorrow morning.\nFurther information on the Postwick junction, including the new temporary traffic flows, the safety reasons for the junction layout and final routes for traffic, is available on Norfolk County Council website.\nLast updated Fri 16 Oct 2015 Travel Norfolk Norwich", "external_links": ["http://www.norfolk.gov.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-16T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:24:15.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
