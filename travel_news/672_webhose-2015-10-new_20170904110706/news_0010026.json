Small group tours offered in English, German, and Spanish will enter without waiting in a queue. Priority access means entering the Sistine Chapel before anyone else, in addition to an exclusive visit to areas normally closed to the public, such as the Bramante Staircase. During Anno Santo, on top of its classic booking service for the Wednesday Papal audiences, Carrani Tours will also offer a visit to the city center that includes participation in Sunday morning mass.\n \nWhen it comes to sightseeing in Rome, there are many different travel packages: Fantasia, Minitour, Mosaics and Regional. Each one presents an itinerary that allows travelers to visit the best of Italy, with the best price/quality exchange; staying in expertly-selected, centrally-located hotels; guided visits; and the guarantee to share the best culture, walks, and locations; surveying the best flavors and the unique atmosphere that is Italy.\n \nSource:- Carrani Tours", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:10:36.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
