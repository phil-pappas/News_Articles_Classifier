Bargains galore ... Warsaw in Poland has the cheapest five-star hotel rates in the world for Aussies. Picture: News Corp Australia Source: News Corp Australia \nHotels.com regional director Katherine Cole said it was clear travellers could still enjoy premier accommodation on a shoestring budget. \n“While travellers may find they don’t have as much spending power as they did a year ago, they’ll be pleased to know that there are exotic destinations to visit that won't break the bank,” Ms Cole said.
