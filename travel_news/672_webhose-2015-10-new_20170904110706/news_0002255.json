Well, I was wrong. \n“Firstly, there is a vast number of phrases Aussies use that no one has ever heard before. So, between ’chucking a wobbly’ and ‘having a cuppa in the arvo’, it usually takes me some 10 days to start being able to fully comprehend what these blokes are saying.” \nHere are a bunch of things Quroa users said surprised them during their visit to Australia: OUR WEIRD ANIMALS Australia is infamous for its dangerous animals and with so many toxic, venomous and toothy beasts it’s a wonder any one wants to visit. It can be hard to find a place to swim in many parts of Northern Australia. (Flickr Michael Coghlan) \nOne Quora user described Australia’s collection of animals as plain “weird”: “Perhaps, intense also. From unique animals to very unique deaths,” he wrote. Roger, a male red kangaroo, hugs a bunny he received as an Easter gift from a fan English fan. Source: Supplied \nBut it’s not the big, scary creatures that cause the most deaths, naturalist Steve Backshall, author of Venom: a Study of Toxins in the Natural World, told The Telegraph. \nTh e most dangerous animals to humans in Australia are horses and honeybees, he said. \n“Almost no-one dies from spider, snake, croc and shark bites on the whole continent. With a little common sense, no one visiting Oz should be unduly worried about the wildlife; quite the opposite, it is a great reason to visit.” Tasmanian devils have sharp powerful claws and a backward facing pouch.

This dunny has seen better days.

I’m not talking about walking around at home without shoes, I’m talking about at shopping malls and even in the town centre. Not everyone does this but if you look around carefully, especially in the summer you will spot one or two,” said Kidd Stuart on Quora. No need for shoes when you’re out and about.

It’s not hard to track down authentic Indian food in Australian cities. (Flickr Eliazar Parra Cardenas) Source: Flickr THE SHOCKING PRICES \nSure it’s unique and beautiful place to visit, but it’s no secret Australia is also a premium destination that comes with a serious price tag. \n“$4 is the price for 600ml of Coke from any convenience store, $6.50 is a ‘cheap’ beer from a pub, and real estate is quite costly too,” said David Sickmiller. THAT AUSSIES EAT RICE \n“Australians eat rice and eat chilli, this always seems to surprise Indonesians,” said Quora user Dave Hodgkin, an Australian living in Indonesia. WE’RE NOT ALL LIKE THE AUSSIES IN BALI \nWhen the loutish behaviour of Australians out for a good time peaks nightly in Kuta, you couldn’t blame the Balinese for writing off Australians as obnoxious drunks with questionable morals. \n“Indonesians often comment that most Australians are surprisingly not like the Aussies they see in Bali,” said Dave Hodgkin. He adds: “Many are also struck by how Australia is NOT all free sex and drunken debauchery.” THAT WE WORK HARD AND PLAY HARD Many visitors expect Australians to be laid-back and therefore not extremely hard workers. \n“Most Indonesians are also struck by how much harder life is in Australia than they imagined, how hard people work to pay rent, etc, but also how hard they play, drink, laugh, study,” said Dave Hodgkin.
