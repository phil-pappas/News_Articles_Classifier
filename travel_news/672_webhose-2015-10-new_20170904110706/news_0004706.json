She is the one who pampers guests, preparing a big breakfast in the morning, advising on the best local restaurants or which village is hosting a morning market.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: John Brunton\nThere is a huge kitchen that everyone can use and a cosy living room with leather armchairs around a stone fireplace. In the early evening, though, it is Thierry who takes centre stage for a tasting of his wines, leading guests down narrow stone steps to his ancient cellar stocked with thousands of bottles of precious vintages. He is a fifth-generation viticulteur, with plots in the Burgundy vineyards of Volnay, Beaune, Monthélie and Meursault, but pride of place goes to the organic pinot noir he makes from Pommard itself. And, after a lengthy tasting session, Thierry often disappears in the depths of the cellar to pull out a dusty bottle of one of his favourite years. Many visitors come back each year, while serious enthusiasts even plan their holiday to join the grape pickers for the annual harvest.\n• Doubles from €90 B&B, +33 380 22 49 98, violot-guillemard.fr\nJohn Brunton\nNena Grintzia: Mpelleiko guesthouse, Peloponnese, Greece Up in the Greek mountains, even in bucolic-sounding Arcadia, you are wise to have a local on your side. Hiking maps are often out-of-date, village tavernas can be inexplicably closed, and organising one of the few taxis to pick you up after a walk can take half a day. In the beautiful village of Stemnitsa you can do no better than trust yourself to Nena Grintzia, the owner of the Mpelleiko guesthouse. Nena grew up here and she is passionate about “her” mountains. Not only does she know every trail, and can advise you on walks both long and short, but she will also give insider knowledge on where to eat, what to see – and will spirit up a ride home if needs be. To cap it all, her home-cooked cakes and pies make every breakfast a new treat.\n• Doubles from €80 B&B, Stemnitsa, +30 27950 81286, mpelleiko.gr\nAndrew Bostock\nThe Rosenovi family: Hotel Rosenovi, Lyaskovo, Devin, Bulgaria Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Rosenovi family. Photograph: Kevin Rushby\nWe were used to good hosts in Bulgaria’s Rhodope Mountains but in the village of Lyaskovo we found something unusual: truly great hosts at the Hotel Rosenovi. There was Zaharina to meet us, and then son, Boris, popped up and finally Rumen, the twinkly-eyed patriarch. Almost immediately, we were inveigled into a compote-tasting session in the gazebo, which then became a herbal tea festival and a tour of the museum that Rumen was building from a collection of rural artefacts started by his father. Somehow the talk – mostly conducted in sign language – got onto bees and beekeeping, so the hives were shown and honey tasted. Dinner was a magnificent spread, and taken with other residents. Everything was homegrown, homemade and delicious, then Boris got his bagpipes out and somehow, between courses, we all ended up dancing and trying on each other’s hats. Did I mention the rakia? Rumen made it in the village’s communal still – just a few hundred bottles per year for personal use. It was a memorable evening and in the morning they sent us off with a packed lunch that really needed a mule to carry it. They had what any host ought to possess: friendliness, sociability, thoughtfulness, generosity and a very large helping of eccentricity.\n• €8pp a night, hotrosenovi@abv.bg.

Catch them over lunch at their Gambian eco-lodge, Sandele Eco-Retreat, and they’ll be happy to chat; let slip that you’re interested in learning about traditional music, say, or coastal wildlife, or even composting toilets, and they’ll introduce you to someone who’s an expert in exactly that. It’s been two decades since Geri and Maurice left their jobs in social care management to forge a new life somewhere they could feel grounded, live lightly and give something back. They created Sandele from scratch. On a sleepy stretch of Atlantic beach, everything about the lodge, from the layout to the handmade construction materials, is eco-friendly. It’s also fully committed to community development. The villagers who own the land have been involved in every stage and will manage the business when the 25-year lease is up. Volunteers, students and development experts gravitate to Sandele because Geri and Maurice are an inspiration. But if all you want to do is practise your yoga stretches in the shade, you’ll also feel perfectly at home.\n• Doubles from £100 full board, +220 7711209, sandele.com\nEmma Gregg\nHugo and Pippa Woolley: Woodlands Country House, Treator, Cornwall On the rolling Cornish cliffs, in a brick, Victorian house about a mile from the sea near Padstow, is Woodlands B&B, owned by Hugo and Pippa Woolley. Twenty years ago, larger-than-life Hugo (then an upmarket butcher in Kent) had a car accident that left him wheelchair-bound for a year and depressed. The decision to move to Padstow and open a B&B was a risky, but ultimately successful, search for a happier lifestyle. Pippa does a lot of the work, but they both take an active part in the cooking, and several shops, including Fortnum and Mason, sell Hugo’s homemade maple-syrup-roasted granola. The gourmet breakfasts can include Cornish oak-smoked kipper with lemon butter, including chives from the garden, rose peppercorns, horseradish and lemon zest, as well as their own compotes, marmalade bars or banana cake. “Watch out for the four-poster bed in the Bay Room honeymoon suite,” says Hugo, laughing – apparently, it’s been notoriously “productive”. There are some great rooms for guests with wheelchairs; one accessible room has a double bed and adjoining conservatory. The in-house walking guide also recommends a wheelchair-friendly coastal route.\n• Doubles from £100 B&B, 01841 532426, woodlands-padstow.co.uk\nPhoebe Taplin\nMichael Leitzinger: Mountain View Resort and Spa, Sulawesi, Indonesia\nMichael Leitzinger, aka Mikel Yaki, runs the Mountain View Resort, a cluster of red-roofed cottages on a hillside in the volcanic highlands of North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Born in Stuttgart, he’s lived in Indonesia for 18 years, first in Papua, now in Sulawesi, and is full of information on the culture, food, history and even dive sites of his adopted home. Michael has the ability to read a guest instantly. As a host, he’ll recommend anything from a volcano climb, with local guide, to short self-guided walks in the dramatic hills. As a guide, he leads expeditions into the dark heart of east Indonesia. Michael has co-authored a German language guide to Sulawesi, and made an Indonesian food programme for German TV: he’s got access to ancient sites and practices that even most locals don’t know. Want to track down a shaman in Minahasa, or a Papuan tribe that still wears penis gourds? Michael’s your man.\n• Cottages at Mountain View Resort Tomohon cost from £17 for two, including breakfast, mountainviewtomohon.com\nTheodora Sutcliffe\nPippa Curtis: Snowgums, French Alps Ten years ago, Australian Pippa Curtis left her life in London to move into a half-ruined farmhouse on the edge of Briançon in the French Alps. Along with raising her daughter Becky, Pippa has created a couple of sympathetically restored apartments – but it’s her passion for her new home that really shines.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pippa Curtis (right)\nWhen I arrived, there was a lovely mini-hamper on the table, and a copy of A Wild Herb Soup, the memoir of local environmental activist Émilie Carles, who fought to stop a motorway running through the beautiful Vallée de la Clarée. It was this valley that Pippa steered me towards, recommending a long day hike through stunning mountains that I didn’t know existed before she’d told me about them. Having immersed herself in the culture and landscape of this frontier with Italy, with several historic forts, and being an expert skier and climber, she knew exactly how we wanted to fill our days. She also knew where to get the perfect cut of duck for a very special barbecue in the sunshine of a late summer evening in the Hautes-Alpes.\n• Two apartments sleeping 4, cost from €425 a week, +33 492 20 44 26, alpsholiday.com\nEd Douglas\nEunice Power: Powersfield House, Dungarvan, Waterford, Ireland Eunice is abuzz whenever you meet her; passionate about excellent local food and her town.

As custodians of Araya Totoan in Yamashiro, they have managed the prefecture’s most splendid ryokan (traditional inn) for an incredible 18 generations, stretching all the way back to the time of the ruling Maeda clan. This area of western Japan has changed beyond recognition in that time, but the reason to come to Yamashiro and the ryokan, remains constant: the whole place is built on an onsen (hot spring). For those new to Japan, this kind of place can be intimidating; there are dozens of rules about decent conduct when it comes to visiting onsens and, with so much history within its walls, you might think Araya Totoan would be too stuffy to enjoy. Not so, thanks to the Nagais, who, while not masters of the English language, are incredibly warm, generous and accommodating, just like their rooms.\n• Doubles from £195, including a lavish kaiseki dinner, +81 761 77 0010, araya-totoan.com\nJamie Lafferty\nKrutarthsinh Jadeja: Devpur Darbargadh Homestay, Kutch, Gujarat, India Facebook Twitter Pinterest\nKrutarthsinh Jadeja, or K as he signs off his emails, has converted his family-owned 110-year-old haveli property in Kutch into a boutique B&B/homestay. Near the Great Rann of Kutch, India’s salt desert and Dholavira, a Harappan civilisation site, this region is also known as Flamingo City – as it is the breeding ground for these migratory birds. An avid traveller himself, K is the kind of host who is neither too distant, nor too involved. He’s a huge promoter of local crafts, such as appliqué work, metal wares and tie-and-dye, and makes it his prerogative to sit with his guests during their meals to share snippets about Kutch – and nearby artisan villages of Bhujodi, Khamir and Ajrakhpur. The B&B has four rooms, each unique yet exquisite and reflective of the local culture with their dome-shaped archways, porticos and pillared halls that remain airy even during summer; they each have their own little library, too, and K is more than happy to let a guest exchange books from their own collection. For guests who’d like to spend a longer and make the most of it, there is a family-run boarding school within the same premises that they can volunteer at.\n• Doubles from £21 B&B, +91 98257 11852,
