Dessert is a rhubarb-strawberry parfait or vanilla-caramel pain perdu. \nThe four-course menu (not available Saturdays) remains $45, the eight-course with everything $85. With wine pairings, they’re $80 and $145, respectively. A cheese course is an extra $15. \nBe prepared: This is delicate haute cuisine based on precision and perfection, not hearty dining. \nLe Cep is open Tuesday through Saturday nights; 3324 W. Seventh St., 817-900-2468 , leceprestaurant.com . Pumpkin-spice pizza \nThe hauntingly good Cane Rosso pizzeria launches a Halloween dessert Friday. \nThe Spooky Bird is a double-secret off-menu dessert pizza with vanilla-bean mascarpone, pumpkin-spice cookie butter and crushed Speculoos shortbreads. \nCane Rosso is still busy for pizzas, the 2-for-$22 lunches and Cuban sandwiches. Open at 11 a.m. daily except Mondays, 5 p.m. Mondays; 815 W. Magnolia Ave., 817-922-9222 , canerosso.com . Chuyitos, Chuy’s together \nChuyito’s Texican Burgers had everything but Tex-Mex. \nSo the Adame family’s artisan hamburger grill has brought back basic Tex-Mex from the family’s local, original Chuy’s Restaurant locations. \nNow, Chuyito’s diners can order the peppery burgers or Chuy’s items including chilaquiles, huevos con chorizo, enchiladas or carne guisada. \nIt marks the neighborhood return of Chuy’s, formerly located kitty-corner across North Main Street. It opens at 10 a.m. daily; 1521 N. Main St., 817-887-9322 , facebook.com/Chuyitosburgers . \n(The Chuy’s Restaurant locations in Fort Worth, Haltom City and River Oaks are not related to the larger Chuy’s Tex-Mex chain in Fort Worth and Arlington.) \nBud Kennedy: 817-390-7538 , bud@star-telegram.com , @EatsBeat .
