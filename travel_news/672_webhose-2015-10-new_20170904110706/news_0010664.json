Try the brioche bun with roast peppered beef, watercress and grain mustard.\n‘Die(t) Another Day’ and decide which dessert takes your fancy. Perhaps the ‘From Russia With Love’ inspired raspberry chocolate mousse volcano with matryoshka or the ‘On Her Majesty’s Secret Service’ Sable Breton with roasted white chocolate ganache. For 007 enthusiasts, no Bond experience would be complete without his signature tipple, so in tribute, try the apple tonka dome mousse with salted caramel sauce in a mini martini glass.\nJumeirah Carlton Tower, a beacon of British style, provides the perfect setting to enjoy this sophisticated experience inspired by James Bond. Situated in the heart of Knightsbridge for over 50 years, the hotel has 216 rooms, including 56 luxurious suites.\nSource:- Jumeirah", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:56:36.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
