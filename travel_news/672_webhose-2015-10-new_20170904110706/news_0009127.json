In a bizarre and terrifying incident, a 24-year-old airline passenger has died on an Aer Lingus flight from Lisbon to Dublin. \nThe captain declared an emergency and landed in Cork, what was too late for the passenger. Before he died , the passenger was running amok, biting another passenger and acting extremely violent. \nHe had to be restrained by the crew. He injured “one or two passengers.” \nThe crew had to broadcast an emergency ‘Pan Pan’ message three times and told air traffic controllers about the incident, before making an unscheduled emergency landing at Cork airport. \nAfter being restrained, the man fell unconscious. He soon lost his pulse and was pronounced dead at Cork airport. There was a doctor onboard, but he could not help. \nThe body of the 24-year-old has been transported to Cork University Hospital for a post-mortem examination. \nThe passenger is reported to have been flying on his own and he may have been studying in Ireland. \nAer Lingus has issued a statement about the incident, which read: \"Aer Lingus flight EI 485 Lisbon to Dublin, diverted into Cork due to a medical emergency on board.” \n\"There were 168 guests and 6 crew members on board. The flight landed safely at 17:40 local time.\" The passengers were taken to Dublin by bus, The Guardian reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:18:55.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
