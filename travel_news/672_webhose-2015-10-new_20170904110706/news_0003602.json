United States soon will be no more.\nCelebrity on Thursday announced it would replace the S.S. United States Restaurant on the 2,170-passenger Celebrity Infinity with an Italian steakhouse.\nThe S.S. United States Restaurant features original, etched glass panels salvaged from the 1950s ocean liner -- an icon of American shipbuilding that retains the record for fastest crossing of the Atlantic. The ship stopped sailing in 1969 but remains docked in Philadelphia amidst efforts to permanently save it.\nCelebrity on Thursday also said it would replace The Normandie restaurant on the 2,158-passenger Celebrity Summit with the same Italian steakhouse planned for the Infinity.\nUSA TODAY\nWorld's largest cruise ship gets a major makeover\nThe Normandie restaurant features original paneling and ornamentation from the celebrated S.S. Normandie, an icon of French passenger shipping that operated in the 1930s.\nThe Italian eateries that will take the place of the historic restaurants will be updated versions of the Tuscan Grille restaurants found on several other Celebrity ships.\nCelebrity says maritime artifacts including an original place setting from the S.S. United States currently in the S.S. United States Restaurant on Celebrity Infinity will be moved to an area at the entrance to the ship's casino. Artifacts from the S.S. Normandie in The Normandie restaurant also will be retained in a new display area.\nThe new eateries will be added as part of minor overhauls of the two ships planned for 2016 that also will include the addition of new rooftop terraces and updated suites.\n48 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1Llxd1v TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Llxd1v&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Llxd1v&text=Celebrity%20Cruises%20to%20jettison%20history-filled%20restaurants&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1Llxd1v", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799755314608971-UnitedStatesRestaurant.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b22fd48cc5c43e2c428abc9d18a5dc7f531de46/r=500x162/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799755314608971-UnitedStatesRestaurant.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/de4b7e4412cc7bd4e235f3f6637931ede23aba0e/c=273-0-688-312&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799755314608971-UnitedStatesRestaurant.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34c2a4d13d230d4fe0693c1a49255c3f73d9e396/c=136-0-536-400/local/-/media/2015/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635678822210680748-low-AL-Aerial006.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:36:57.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
