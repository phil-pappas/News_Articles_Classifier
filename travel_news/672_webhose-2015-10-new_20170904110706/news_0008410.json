The posting got at least 1.6 million views, with many showering the rescuer with praise.\nThe Norwegian pair, whose names were not released, had taken their cameras to a river estuary at first light Friday, but the mudflats proved to be far less firm than they had thought. Very quickly, they found themselves sinking.\nA local construction worker, identified by Thai media as Chat Ubonchinda, was heading home from his fishing trip by boat when he spotted them.\nFirst, he tried to pull the two out, but the mud was too thick.\nAfter taking their belongings to firmer ground, Chat lay down in the mud and let the two lift themselves up by pulling against his body. One of them even crawled across his back on the way to safety.\n\"All Thais are proud of what you did, it's great and no more words need to be explained,\" Somchai Ouansakul wrote in a Facebook comment. \"I wish all Thais would have such a big heart like this.\"\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:27:28.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
