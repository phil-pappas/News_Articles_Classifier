The head and tail are left on. It then goes in the wok. Ingredients such as shrimp, nuts and mushrooms are added to boiling sweet and sour sauce and poured over the fish, creating a squeaking sound. The result is a plate of fish shaped like a squirrel, hence its common name, \"squirrel fish.\" Best at: \nMaXiangXing CaiGuan , YunNan North Road 32, Nanjing China; +86 25 8328 6387/6388; 6:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m. Duck blood vermicelli soup Yes, the soup is made of duck-blood curd and offal -- but that doesn't deter local connoisseurs.
