When an index falls, a tracker, if it is doing its job, falls in step with it. Human fund managers, on the other hand, are in a position to avoid basket case sectors or companies that they feel are on a downward trajectory. There is some evidence of this effect. Work by Tilney Bestinvest, the fund shop, found that 79pc of active fund managers outperformed more often than not in months when the relevant index fell. Does this mean, then, that fund managers are relying solely on skill and insight to avoid losing companies? Not exactly. The need of fund managers to hold cash in their funds, in order to be able to buy when they see opportunities, means that they are never fully invested. When markets fall, they don’t feel the full effect and will, all things being equal, outperform the index. The reverse situation is also true, of course, and only a third of them outperformed in a majority of months when the markets in which they operated rose, according to the same research. There are, however, managers who have a remarkably good record of outperformance in the bad times. Some have records of beating the market in more than 80pc of months when returns are negative. Jason Hollands, managing director of Tinley Bestinvest, said: “When people invest in the markets they focus on the upside, but when it comes to adding value and outperformance a large part of that is about defending capital in the tougher times.” He added that some funds had proactively built larger-than-usual cash positions as a defence against market falls. For example, John Wood, who runs the JO Hambro Capital Management UK Opportunities fund and features among the best defensive performers, held almost 18pc in cash at the end of August, helping to avoid the worst of the falls that month. The research looked at the records of 353 fund managers or teams with track records in a particular sector of at least five years. Those who have outperformed most frequently in each UK sector are listed in the table.

Mr Hollands said there could be various reasons why a manager consistently beats falling markets but that the one attribute that all have in common is their low “correlation” to the benchmark – in other words, their funds look nothing like the indices against which they are measured. “They do not manage their portfolios in a ‘benchmark-aware’ fashion,” he said. “These are genuinely actively managed funds.” This is a lesson worth remembering whether in rising or falling markets. Telegraph Money recently included it in its five investing golden rules this advice: active fund managers need to justify the extra fees they charge by doing things the rest of the market is not. Should you go defensive? Whether or not you opt for a fund based on its ability to perform well during tough markets depends on how pessimistic you are about markets in general. Active funds can struggle against their tracker counterparts in rising markets. Inevitable interest rate rises, however, and doubts about global demand driven by China are behind widespread expectations that stock market returns will be lower from here. • Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas Tom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: “In the low-growth environment we envisage, individual stock selection is key. Companies that can demonstrate sustainable growth will trade at a premium and picking this kind of stock will be a key differentiator. “Passive funds by their nature are obliged to buy all the companies in an index, both high and low growth.” Mr Stevenson said the tendency of active managers to focus on smaller and medium sized companies had helped them avoid the worst falls this year, which have been concentrated among the large, global companies. “Passive funds, by definition, are weighted towards the larger companies, he said.” ‘Absolute return’ funds: another safe haven? Many advisers now believe bonds, the traditional resort for those anxious about share price falls, may be in for their own tough time, thanks mostly to the prospect of interest rate rises that will make bond returns less attractive and force their prices down. As a result, more investors are opting for “absolute return” funds. These are more complicated than traditional funds and may not be for everyone for that reason. They use financial instruments such as “shorting” to allow them to make money when markets fall – borrowing a share the manager believes will fall in value and repaying it once the price has fallen. As the cost of the shares is lower, a profit is created. Darius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, another fund shop, recommended Church House Tenax Absolute Return Strategies, Henderson UK Absolute Return, Premier Defensive Growth and Smith & Williamson Enterprise, each of which has returned between minus 1pc and 1pc in the volatile markets since the FTSE 100 peaked on April 27, against a 9.2pc fall in the market. Five shares to weather a storm For those who prefer to pick their own shares, Telegraph Money has worked with Sharepad.co.uk , an online investing data and tool provider, to draw a list of stocks that have a track record of weathering market falls. All fell by less than the market during the last crash – from the summer of 2007 to March 2009 – and all grew strongly again once it passed. Each company on the list fell no more than 5pc in the crash, is up this year and has returned more than 100pc since the crash, has paid a dividend of at least 2pc for eight years, has higher profits than at the start of the crash, and has average “return on equity” of more than 10pc over eight years.
