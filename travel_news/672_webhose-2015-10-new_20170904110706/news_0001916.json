Currently under construction, the new ship is designed specifically to suit the preferences of Chinese guests. \n\nCredit: Norwegian Cruise Line \n\nWith a capacity for 4,200 guests, the new ship will the be the second of NCL’s Breakaway Plus class which features the line’s unique Freestyle Cruising. \n\n“Our new purpose-built ship for China will have characteristics that are authentic to NCL and yet distinctively Chinese in all of its sensibility,” said Frank Del Rio, CEO of NCL. \n\nMore details, including the ship’s name, homeport and accommodation, will be provided later. NCL will receive its first Breakaway Plus class ship, the Norwegian Escape , on October 22, 2015. Two additional ships in this class are on order for delivery in 2018 and 2019. \n\nThe Miami-based line has also opened offices in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai to bring its main NCL brand, alongside Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, into the Asian market. \n\nOut of its fleet of 21 ships, four – namely the Norwegian Star , Oceania Nautica , Oceania Insignia and Regent Seven Seas Voyager – will be deployed to Asia for 2016/17 itineraries. \n\nSpeaking to TTGAsia e-Daily , NCL's senior vice president and managing director, Asia, William Harber, said: “Asia accounts for only a single digit of the group’s business and what’s exciting about Asia is the growth potential. Two key factors contributing to the growth are awareness of great products and more people being able to afford to cruise.\" \n\nHarber added that the three brands do not compete with one another for resources within the company as they cater to distinct consumer segments. \n\nLooking ahead, he revealed that more emphasis will be placed on growing the ‘fly-cruise’ market for all three brands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:44:43.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
