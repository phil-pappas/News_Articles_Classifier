The research behind the report was conducted in partnership with Visit Scotland, the national tourism organisation. \nThe report shows that despite 77 percent of those surveyed considering Scotland an LGBT Friendly destination, only three per cent said Scotland comes to mind first when thinking about LGBT destinations around the world. \nScott Cuthbertson, from the Equality Network, said: “Scotland has all the ingredients of a world class LGBT friendly travel destination, a favourable legal landscape, great places to visit and the friendliest people in the world, its time to make more of that and send out a warm welcome to LGBT travelers.” \nNow the Equality Network has said it is developing an LGBT travel guide which will be launched next year and distributed in core markets. The aim of the guide to encourage more LGBT tourists to visit Scotland. \nVisit Scotland has also used the research behind the report to launch a special LGBT portal on visitscotland.com to better support the needs of LGBT travellers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:30:07.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
