HAM AND GOAT’S CHEESE COURONNE SERVES 4 – 6 I’m very fond of the French ‘crown’, because it’s a great way of getting flavour into a dough. It’s also an excellent use for the air-dried ham now produced – along with salamis and chorizo – by artisan producers in Cumbria and elsewhere in the country. And if you can get a local goat’s cheese too, so much the better. 1. Put the flour into a large bowl and add the salt on one side, the yeast on the other. Add the butter, egg and two-thirds of the milk, then turn the mixture with the fingers of one hand. Add the remaining milk a little at a time, continuing to mix until all the flour from the side is taken in and the dough is soft and slightly sticky; you might not need all the milk. 2. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes. Initially the dough will be sticky but it will become easier to work as you continue to knead. When it feels smooth and silky, put it into a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for about an hour, until doubled in size. 3. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Without knocking back, roll it into a rectangle about 33x25cm.Turn the dough, if necessary, so you have a long edge facing you. Lay the ham slices over the dough. Break the goat’s cheese into pieces and scatter them over the ham, then sprinkle over the basil. 4. Starting at a long edge, roll the dough up tightly, like a Swiss roll. Roll it back and forth a little to seal, then cut it in half lengthways, leaving it joined at the top. Twist the ð dough lengths together, as if wringing out a cloth, then join the ends to form a circle. Transfer to the lined baking tray. 5. Place the baking tray inside a clean plastic bag and leave the couronne to prove until doubled in size. Heat the oven to 200 °C/Gas 6. 6. Bake the couronne for 25 minutes until risen and golden brown. Leave to cool on a wire rack.
