Over $20,000 has been donated by supporting individuals so far, and with Larkmead’s matching, the total is now over $40,000. They hope to reach their goal of $50,000 by the end of the month. “So many businesses and homes have been destroyed by this brutal catastrophe,” owner Cam Baker said. “We feel it is our responsibility as a neighbor and member of the community to come together and do what we can to help. Over 1,400 homes have burned and so many people have lost their place of employment and their jobs. We want to help our friends and families in Lake County in this time of great need.”\nThe Valley Fire Relief Fund is a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit and is channeling funds to two primary organizations. The Up Valley Family Center provides immediate aid to families who are struggling with large bills such as mortgages, utilities and car payments as well as providing funds for urgent daily needs such as food, diapers and toiletries in the form of gift cards. The Rotary of Middletown will also receive money to help aid families who were renting with no insurance and suffered severe losses.\nIf you would like to make a donation that will be part of the Larkmead Vineyards match, please send a check to Larkmead Vineyards (note Larkmead Match) at 1100 Larkmead Lane, Calistoga, CA 94515, care of Amy Rushforth or to the Calistoga Chamber of Commerce at 133 Washington Street, Calistoga, CA 94515.\nAbout Larkmead Vineyards\nFounded in 1895, Larkmead Vineyards is one of Napa Valley’s most historic estates and is recognized as one of the most exceptional vineyard sites of the region.
