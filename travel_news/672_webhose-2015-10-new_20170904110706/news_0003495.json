What to see in Mirepoix \nMirepoix was disastrously flooded in 1279. In 1289, Guy de Lévis rebuilt the town on the left banks of the river, with a large central square--Place du Maréchal-Leclerc--and streets laid out in a grid pattern. \nThe Place du Maréchal-Leclerc is one of the best and most evocative medieval squares in Europe to see, and a perfect example of people friendly architecture. The medieval buildings that line the square offer the shade of ground floor arcades held up by absolutely massive beams--those of the Maison des Consuls are carved with representations of people and animals at the ends of the beams. The tourist office of Mirepoix is in this square. \nMonday is the weekly outdoor market in the Place du Maréchal-Leclerc, and it shouldn't be missed. Mirepoix will always be associated with fine French cooking, having given its name to the basic starting point of aromatic chopped vegetables consisting of carrots, onions and celery. (Actually, a chef named them after his patron, a military man from Mirepoix with the rather lengthy name of Charles-Pierre-Gaston-François de Lévis du Mirepoix.) \nThe church of St Maurice built in 1298 by Jean de Lévis was transformed over time into the Mirepoix cathedral--Cathédrale Saint-Maurice de Mirepoix. It's Gothic and known for its wide nave, the second widest in Europe. \nThe Mirepoix market is held on Monday mornings. It's many peoples favorite market in France.
