It was around 120C in the shade in the main square. Buskers were being slow-roasted. I was showing a French friend around town. He was of an academic bent, the only man I know who not only understands but is also enthusiastic about Basque passion plays. Though he looked pretty cool, I was liquefying. We walked in front of the spot where the city’s little tourist train waited. “Why don’t we hop on this?” I asked. “No,” he said, as if I’d offered him a Mickey Mouse balloon or a subscription to Reader’s Digest. Dignified people generally react thus before little tourist trains . They fear the humiliation of being caught on an item direct from a children’s fantasy. This is not very bright. For a start, no one’s going to judge you for being on a happy little train. You see a brain surgeon on a tourist train, you don’t think he’s any less of a surgeon. You just think he’s a brain surgeon on a tourist train, and therefore probably quite a jolly sort of brain surgeon. Brain surgeons could certainly use that kind of corrective to their image. Montpellier's shining example Photo: ALAMY Secondly, the trains are a fine way of getting an overview of anywhere, without conking out. I’ve been on lots – Nice , Cannes , Monaco , Bordeaux and, most recently, at the vast salt pans site near Aigues-Mortes. This covers some 26,000 acres. You do that on foot, you do it without me. The trains don’t miss much. As we slogged up the street towards Montpellier’s Arc-de-Triomphe – a near-death experience – the little train tootled gaily past. “We could have been on that,” I gasped to my friend. “We could have been on the Titanic ,” he snapped, with unnecessary drama. Thirdly, and crucially, these splendid vehicles subvert the French tendency to take their history too seriously. The French are always going on about architectural minutiae, cultural movements and such like, which is OK, but needs leavening. Put it this way: in Avignon, you cannot get overwhelmed by the gravity of the Papal Palace if you’re arriving in a train which might have been driven by Noddy. Children are waving. Things are humanised. The past was human, so all that is as it should be. \"No one's going to judge you for being on a happy little train\" Photo: ALAMY There are dangers. A while ago, in Orange, the town’s little train had been commandeered by our British coach group. Coach driver John and I were on the last row of the last carriage. This faced backwards. The train driver was showing off, the Evel Knievel of tourist outings. As he swung fast around a tight corner, the last carriage went into orbit. John went flying. “You know this city is run by the extreme Right?” I shouted. “Tell me something I couldn’t have guessed,” he cried, airborne. Then he landed back. “I’d never realised these things were so exciting,” he said. I rest my case.
