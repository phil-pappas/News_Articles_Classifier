Work on building the ship formerly known as Bliss began last month – but now it is to get a new name and design tweaks to make it more suited to Chinese passengers.\nThe ship will be delivered in spring 2017, around the same time that Majestic Princess will commence cruising from Shanghai.\nThis week’s second announcement, from Carnival Corporation , confirmed ships from German brand AIDA and Carnival Cruise Line would be heading east.\nCarnival Cruise Line president Christine Duffy said: “We look forward to introducing Chinese guests to the exceptional experience that has made Carnival the world’s most popular cruise line with over 4.5 million guests a year.”\nRoyal Caribbean already has a strong presence in the Far East, with new-build Quantum of the Seas its flagship in the region.\nAs it has discovered, tailoring the cruises to appeal to the Chinese involves more than replacing the burger bar with noodles.\nChinese holidaymakers are not only prepared to pay higher fares than their American and European counterparts, they are intent on spending lots of money on luxury goods on sale aboard the ships.\nThe recent financial crisis and devaluation has done little to suppress the Chinese appetite for travel – there is an untapped market of hundreds of millions of people.\nMore and more are acquiring the wealth that brings them to Europe and to the Bicester Outlet Village in Oxfordshire – the single biggest attraction for UK Chinese visitors.\nAnd there is a vast number who haven’t seen the sea, let alone a ship.\nFollow me on Twitter at @CaptGreybeard DailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CaptGreybeard?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-10-17T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:54:52.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
