That was back in April, and my toe healed properly only last week. \"It's been months and months with this slightly icky, manky toe that I was quite lucky to keep. I was wearing leather boots that got wet, I didn't want them to freeze overnight so I brought them into my sleeping bag. But I actually kept them on my feet, so when I woke up my feet were just blocks of ice.\" Stafford is no stranger to doing it rough. The 39-year-old holds the Guinness World Record for being the first man to walk the entire length of the Amazon river, a feat he began in 2008 and accomplished in 2010, taking a total of 860 days. NZPA/KEITH DUCATEL \nThe explorer says he endured 50,000 mosquito bites while becoming the first man to walk the Amazon. \nFROM THE ARCHIVES: Captain first to walk Amazon river \nHis video footage from the expedition was made into a Discovery Channel documentary and a book, both called Walking the Amazon . Stafford has since been involved in other projects for the channel, including a TV series, Naked and Marooned with Ed Stafford , where he was dropped off on an uninhabited island for 60 days with no food, water, tools or clothes. \nStafford says he aims to provide authenticity at a time when television is saturated with other so-called \"survival\" and \"adventure\" shows. \n\"I can tell how scripted that is, I can tell how contrived that is. Wouldn't it be more fun if it was for real, if the viewer genuinely knew you were on an unfolding journey - you didn't know what was going to happen next - wouldn't that be more exciting than the viewer kind of knowing that it's all been scripted?\" \nFor that reason, his television series are either entirely self-filmed, or shot with the assistance of a single cameraman. \"I've got a bean bag in place with a tripod, I plonk the camera down on that. It enables a natural adventure, rather than having a crew who would require you to stop and repeat things and do it over and over again.\" \nEd Stafford looking over the harbour in Mongu, Zambia.

In the first episode of Into the Unknown , Stafford travels to war-torn West Papua, where he comes across a group of indigenous people living in a swamp. Ad Feedback \n\"We had a little chat, me and the cameraman, before we went in. Normally we'd try to have helicopter back up to be able to get us out of there quickly if it went wrong. On that one, it was so remote there was just no chance of that. There were no helicopters. We did a little risk assessment between us, and a little giggle, going, 'are we prepared to do this?' \"We were prepared to do it.\" The adventurer admits he's always needed to do \"slightly extreme things\" to stay content in life. Growing up in Leicestershire, he spent his childhood in the countryside, building dams and treehouses and roaming around the fields. \"I had this really close affinity with nature and I liked being myself. I didn't really like just following the norm and doing what everyone else was doing.\" It was a natural progression, Stafford says, that he decided to join the army after university, where he would spend four years before leaving in 2002 as a captain. But he dismisses the idea that his time in the military fuelled his passion for adventure. \nStafford is a former British army captain turned expedition leader. Image: Ian Goddfrey \n\"I got some fairly dull postings. I was in Northern Ireland for a lot of the time, which was dreaded. The more and more time that goes by, the military holds less significance in my life. \n\"Most of my expedition experience and most my survival experience is drawn more from indigenous tribes than it is from military experiences.\" \nWhile the military fostered a sense of \"smash your way through the jungle\", Stafford says what he does now is far more in tune with the environment. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:27:56.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
