Terrifying glass-bottomed bridge opens in Hunan (VIDEO) Thursday October 1, 2015 Print Article \nTourists look down as they walk on a glass suspension bridge at the Shiniuzhai National Geo-park in Pinging county, Hunan province, September 24, 2015. — Reuters pic BEIJING, Oct 1 — Those who suffer from acrophobia will want to steer clear of this all-glass suspension bridge that recently opened in China’s Hunan Province. \nBut those with a head for heights may brave the aptly named Haohan Qiao, or “Brave Men’s Bridge”, a 300-metre walkway suspended 180 metres above ground between two cliffs. \nThe dizzying transparent bridge sits above a valley in the Shiniuzhai National Geological Park. \nIf you manage to keep your eyes open, take a look around at the amazing scenery: Hunan’s geological formations are credited for inspiring the breathtaking scenery in director James Cameron’s blockbuster movie “Avatar.” \nWhile it sounds frightening enough, the glass bridge was actually built to replace the original one made of wood. \nNonetheless, the authorities assure intrepid travellers that the walkway’s 24mm-thick glass panes are 25 times stronger than other forms of glass, allowing it to “stand firm even if tourists are jumping on it”, a worker who built the bridge told the China News Service . \n“The steel frame used to support and encase the glass bridge is also very strong and densely built, so even if glass is broken, travellers won’t fall through,” the worker added. \nThe 300-metre-long glass bridge, which opened to tourists for the first time last week, spans over a canyon, which is about 180-metre-deep, local media reported. — Reuters pic However, if your legs suddenly turn to jelly, there are trained staff members available to help anyone in need of emotional support to make the walk across. \n“Brave Men’s Bridge” might be China’s first all-glass suspension passage, but it won’t be the country’s last. \nAccording to Wired , another similar connection will open across the Zhangjiajie Grand Canyon area, also in Hunan province, later this year. \nSpanning 430-metres long and 300-metres high, it is set to be the world’s highest glass bridge once completed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:51:41.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
