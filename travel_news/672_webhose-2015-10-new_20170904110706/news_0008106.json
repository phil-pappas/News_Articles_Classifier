He said the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority should allow all the international airlines to land and take off from Mombasa in order to revive the sector.\n \n \nTourism is a major foreign exchange earner for Kenya, which has famed serene beaches that charm many Western tourists.\n \n \nDuring the first half of the year, Kenya witnessed a spate of terrorist attacks perpetuated by the Somali militant group the Al-Shabaab with the worst happening at Garissa University, where 147 people, including students, were killed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:55:49.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
