Answer: buy a remote beachfront block and just wait 65 years.\nHarold and Sylvia Roach did just that back in 1950 when they paid £750 pounds for the 4850sq m block that includes a private slice of beach on title.\n“It was an old dairy farm in those days, there was nothing else there,” says Peter Roach, Harold and Sylvia’s son.\n“There was originally only one wooden house down there. It was one of the houses for the people employed at the dairy. It had a wood stove and a tin bath out the back room — it was pretty basic.” The $9 million view.

Picture: realestate.com.au Source: Supplied\nThe old farming cottages are gone and the big block now has two modern homes; a three-bedroom residence and a four-bedroom cottage, both with uninterrupted 180 degree views of Kirby Beach.\nThe secluded beach is named after the former president of the Arbitration Commission, Sir Richard Kirby, a friend of Harold and his neighbour at the time.\nNow Peter’s neighbour is Sydney pub baron Justin Hemmes who reportedly spent $4.15 million for his slice of South Coast paradise in 2007. A big breakfast never looked so good. Picture: realestate.com.au Source: Supplied\nEvery room has a $9 million view. Picture: realestate.com.au Source: Supplied\nToday, selling agent Gaby Rogers of Colliers International is seeking more than double that for the Roach beach retreat currently listed on real.estate.com.au .\n“Well I put that price on it,” Peter says. “There are two houses on the block and not many properties have absolute beachfront like this,” he says.\nAlthough Roach’s parents died decades ago, the family has continued to holiday at the property.\n“I think they’d be surprised at the value today,” Peter says.\nThe Myrniong Grove estate is only minutes from Berrara, and is 200km south of Sydney.\nBut when the traffic gets too much, there is always room to park a chopper. From 750 pounds to $9 million in 65 years.
