Following reviews with relevant experts and Lewes District Council this week, the Network Rail team reported that the quickest and safest way to reopen the crossing was to install a full-width barrier crossing with automatic object detection equipment – a modern, safe system used widely in Britain and other European countries. This will begin immediately with the intention to open the road within five weeks.\n \nThe current unsafe listed gates to the crossing will be carefully removed over the weekend 24/25 October and stored safely until a long-term solution for the crossing has been determined with full consent from the local authority.\n \nAt the same time, Network Rail will appeal Lewes District Council planning committee’s decision, as well as submitting a new application for listed buildings consent. Network Rail assured residents that they will be bound by the outcome of both of these processes and that they will continue to work closely with the council to understand the implications of doing this.\n \nWe will work with the parish, district and county councils to address a number of issues raised in the meeting, including signage and measures to help people with personal mobility issues.\n \nAlasdair Coates, Network Rail route managing director for the South East, said: “It’s clear many people will be disappointed by this decision but the community were clear that the priority for them is to reopen the road as quickly and safely as possible. The solution announced this evening is the only option that will allow us to do that. The Plumpton level crossing gates will be carefully removed and stored whilst the appeal and new application for listed buildings consent is pursued.”\n \n \nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:41:33.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
