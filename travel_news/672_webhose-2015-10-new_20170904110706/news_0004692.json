Total expenditures for those trips fell 9.0% to $8.7 billion. Note to readers The Travel Survey of Residents of Canada underwent a redesign in 2011. The survey scope is more inclusive and allows more trips to be collected. Moreover, its new design makes it easier to report trips. These changes are increasing the survey estimates from previous years. This creates a break in the domestic tourism time series. \nA more exhaustive document explaining the differences between the redesigned 2011 Travel Survey of Residents of Canada and the 2010 survey is available on our website.
