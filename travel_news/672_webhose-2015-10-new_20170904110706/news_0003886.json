(Darron Cummings / Associated Press) Catharine Hamm \nEt tu, Amtrak? \nThe passenger rail service is cracking down on passengers who carry too much stuff. You can take two 50-pound bags and two 25-pound carry-ons, which is a whole lot more generous than the airlines. \nExceed that and you’ll pay the price. Starting Thursday, Amtrak will charge a $20 excess baggage fee for every bag over that limit . \nBy packing smarter, you still can avoid fees on Amtrak. \nThere are other ways to avoid bag fees when you travel on other modes. Airlines are especially hungry for those fees, which totaled $3.4 billion in 2014. \n-- Fly Southwest Airlines . Bless its heart, it still doesn’t charge for baggage.

If you wanted to book a round-trip ticket from LAX to San Francisco for tomorrow, you’d pay at least $451 to fly. On Greyhound, you’d pay $74. Yes, it takes longer, but you can do a lot of reading/texting/pinning/tweeting in that time. \n-- Drive. If you were a family of four flying from LAX to Phoenix and each of you had a bag, you’d pay $200 in baggage fees. According to the AAA Fuel Cost Calculator , if you were driving a 2014 Honda Accord, your fuel cost would be about $40, round-trip. \nLike the bus, it would take longer, but who doesn’t love “Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer on the Wall” sung off key for the about 750 miles?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:06:46.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
