Stop on George St where passengers previously got on buses for the Hills District. Like all buses that used George St, these routes have now been diverted to allow for light rail work in the city.

If I was the travelling public I would give myself quite a bit of extra time.” \nMr Preston said he was particular concerned about the number of routes congregating at Wynyard and intersections along Elizabeth St as well as the extra costs forced on passengers changing from buses onto trains. Transport bosses are hoping this won’t be the view greeting commuters on Tuesday morning. Source: News Corp Australia \n“[The government] should be able to waive some of these costs during the construction and potential chaos we’re going to see.” \nTransport for NSW’s co-ordinator general for CBD transport, Marg Prendergast, said congestion was inevitable but worth it in the long run. \n“Habits are hard to break and there’s every chance a bus might take a wrong turn at some point,” she told news.com.au \n“It’s going to be difficult but we’re going to do our best to manage all those impacts and keep Sydney moving. \n“But ultimately we have to do something about the buses because reliability in the centre of the city was so poor,” she told radio 2GB last Friday. \n“Light rail will offer so much more capacity and a turn-up-and-go service but we’ve got pain for the next four years while we do it.” \nPLAN AHEAD \nMs Prendergast said CBD commuters should plan their journey at www.transportnsw.info as their route and stop will likely have changed. \nAn army of 120 pink-clad staff would be on hand to help commuters get to work with 50 police on standby to provide “operational assistance”. \nAnd she had a stark warning to the 20,000 car drivers who enter the CBD on a normal weekday, “If you’re in a clearway or bus zone, we can tow you away because we just can’t have one driver who parks holding up all those buses.” Transport for NSW employees Leanne Grant and Troy Griffith helping bus passengers with the CBD changes at Railway Square bus interchange.

Chief executive of Secure Parking, Garth Matthews, has suggested car owners join up with blindsided bus users for a trip into the city: “Not only will you have great company on the drive but it will also be a more comfortable trip than squeezing into overcrowded trains”. \nBut Mr Preston had a plea to perturbed passengers — don’t get angry at the bus drivers, “With the hot temperatures, I think we’ll find a lot of bus drivers and passengers a bit agitated. Don’t take it out on the bus drivers, ring the government of transport, they’re the ones that came up with the changes”. \nFIVE WAYS TO AVOID THE BUS CRUSH: \nPlan A: Plot your new trip online \nHead to www.transportnsw.info to make sure you know when and where your bus is going. \nPlan B: Allow extra time \nAvoid the 8am-9am crunch time when buses are at their busiest. \nPlan C: Take another form of transport \nTrains, ferries and the light rail are free of alterations and may be a better bet. But be warned, Wynyard, Central and Newtown stations are expected to be busy with people changing from buses to trains. \nPlan D: Car drivers, avoid the city \n“We have one appeal to car drivers,” says Ms Prendergast. “iIf you don’t need to drive through please come round the outskirts or come a bit earlier or later.” \nPlan E: Carpool \nIf you must drive, do the right thing and take on a bus-travelling friend for the next few days. If nothing else, it’s good karma.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:35:42.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
