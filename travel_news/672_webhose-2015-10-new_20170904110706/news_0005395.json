Teambuild UK is construction’s top team building competition, with a focus on helping develop the leadership and team co-ordination skills of young professionals in the construction industry. The event is a cross disciplinary contest which has been running for 25 years. This year it will take place on 20-22 November. \n“Our competitors represent major companies from all disciplines within the construction industry, making it a great opportunity not only to gain new skills but to network with peers and other organisations,” comments Richard Hart, Director of Administration at Teambuild. “Lane End provides us with the necessary space to enable our teams to work comfortably over the course of the competition. The modern facilities and the knowledgeable staff are also important to us and that is why we will be returning for a fourth year.” The intensive nature of the event means Teambuild UK requires a specialist venue and Lane End will once again provide access to three self-contained buildings; Wycombe Hall, Wycombe Court and The Pavilion. The size and variety of conference rooms in the Wycombe Hall and Wycombe Court buildings provide ample space for the teams to work on individual projects. These two interconnected buildings also offer a private dining room and two comfortable lounges within close proximity to the conference rooms where the participants can relax. On the final day the group gathers in The Pavilion, a large space with high ceilings and plenty of natural light. “We are really excited to be hosting Teambuild UK for the fourth year,” comments Heni Fourie, Sales Marketing Manager at Lane End Conference Centre. “The event is fast-paced, challenging, and fun; it's professional training at its best so we are thrilled to be part of it. Lane End frequently holds exciting events but Teambuild UK is something we always look forward to as a venue.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:23:59.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
