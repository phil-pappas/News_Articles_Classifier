With fifty-two organisations in total across a range of sectors, The Landmark London was the only hotel to take part and receive the Gold Accreditation, which is a testament to the hotels commitment to realising the potential of its team members. \nThe Standard defines what it takes to lead, support and manage people well to achieve sustainable results. Underpinning the Standard is the Investors in People framework. The framework reflects the latest workplace trends, essential skills and effective structures required to outperform in any industry. Revisions have also been made to the assessment process which now includes an online assessment increasing the sample of employees involved, as well as the chance to benchmark against thousands of organisations. Paul Devoy, Head of Investors in People, said: “Meeting the sixth generation Standard is something that The Landmark London should be extremely proud of, it is the sign of a great employer, an outperforming place to work and a clear commitment to success. I would like to thank every person at The Landmark London for their involvement in the pilot and their collaboration with Investors in People at this important time. Most of all I would like to congratulate them on their fantastic achievement.” Commenting on the award, The Landmark London’s General Manager Andrew Batchelor remarks: “We are all delighted to be awarded this highly prestigious accolade. As a hotel we are committed to the very best practice in people management and we believe that it is our dedicated team that makes staying at The Landmark London such an exceptional experience for our hotel guests. The Investors in People Gold Level Accreditation is testament to the culture we seek to create”. Investors in People also unveiled the first ever real-time ‘People Management Dashboard’.
