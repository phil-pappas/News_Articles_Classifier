I don’t work with heavy industrial machinery. I was pretty sure I could keep a computer going for nine hours. My smartphone might need a quick recharge in the middle of the afternoon and the 40W halogen desk lamp would have to go on at dusk. But that would be about it, apart from a break for lunch, the occasional use of a dictaphone and about three cups of coffee. I took on the challenge and set up the exercise bike in my kitchen. On the allotted morning the first thing I needed to do was a bit of maths. Skipping my hot shower for once, my first energy use would be boiling a kettle for a cuppa. This, it transpires, is not an easy introduction to the challenge. Heating a full kettle (just under a litre of water) takes about two minutes. That boils down to 40 watts of electricity, which doesn’t sound like a lot. In energy terms it isn’t but, as I was soon to discover, in human energy terms it really is. Tea drinkers: boiling the kettle is certainly the costliest aspect of making a cuppa BREWED AWAKENING I got on the bike, fully pumped for the challenge ahead and desperately needing some caffeine. But it became clear very quickly just how hard a task I had been set. An elite Tour de France-standard cyclist – which I am not – generates between 300 and 400 watts of energy on average per hour. Taking the higher figure, it would take one of these guys six minutes of intense cycling to boil 1.5 pints of water. I began pedalling, steadily increasing my pace to maximum. But looking down at the bike’s display, I saw I was producing less than half the power a professional athlete would. What’s more, after 10 minutes I was drenched in sweat and hitting something athletes refer to as “the wall”. The good ones power through this mental blockade, but I waved a white flag and stopped. In 10 minutes I had managed to produce only 30 watts of power in total, a mere three quarters of the way to my morning brew. Then it hit me: a get-out. Why fill the kettle all the way to the top? It’s a classic energy saving tactic to put in only the exact amount of water you plan to use. Keeping my modest 30 watts in mind, I filled the kettle halfway and using some cod maths reasoned that boiling it now would use only half the power, or 20 watts. Not only did I have my much-needed beverage, but also 10 watts in the bank. High fives all round. For tea drinkers, it’s worth noting here that boiling the kettle is almost certainly the costliest aspect of making a cuppa. A teabag costs less than 2p on average (assuming you haven’t got a penchant for fancy organic stuff), the cost of milk and water is marginal, but boiling the water costs roughly two and a half pence a pop. REALITY BYTES Refocusing, I drank a glass of invigorating orange squash, ignoring any energy connotation. (It certainly took energy to bring it to my glass but it wasn’t my energy, it was someone else’s.) Now to the business of the day. I switched on the PC, glad of my surplus 10 watts, but my heart sank again when I checked the energy consumption of a standard desktop computer: the best guess for a modern one is about 100 watts per hour. That meant my surplus would become a deficit in six minutes. Worse still, it had taken seven minutes to do the research. From now on the debt would ratchet up like interest on a payday loan. In an hour’s time I would have to create 90 watts of energy on that infernal bike. If someone rang me, it would be even more. Exasperated, I started to tot up the numbers. If my 30-watt cup of coffee had cost me 10 minutes of hard cycling, then 90 watts would take me half an hour, even if I ignored the inevitable decline in my performance as a human dynamo. Nevertheless I was not (yet) to be beaten and soon I was back in the saddle, taking the bike up to a steady 180 watts per hour and gritting my teeth for the long and painful “journey” ahead. My resolve lasted a further 15 minutes (45 watts) before I collapsed into a breathless, drenched heap. New ways to cheat came to me. I could switch to a laptop, turn the heating off, not eat any food – particularly not toast – disconnect the doorbell, and write a mass email and send it to all my contacts ordering them not to call me. But even a laptop expends 30 watts an hour; an energy burst that would be way beyond me now. A mere two hours into the challenge, I had to admit defeat. OK Telegraph, you win.
