Any decline in visitor numbers will have a ripple effect on retail sales in Hong Kong, which have shrunk for the fifth straight month since March.\nA recent Credit Suisse report showed Japan and Thailand have become the top draws for mainland tourists, with numbers to Japan up 133 per cent and Thailand 115 per cent year on year in August. Their numbers to Hong Kong in September dropped 0.2 per cent and 7.1 per cent in August.\n“The movement in foreign exchange means our products are about three per cent more expensive to mainlanders,” said Lau Hak-bun, sales director of jewellery retailer Chow Sang Sang.\n“The price difference is huge as consumer goods are getting at least 10 per cent cheaper in Europe and Southeast Asia.”\nA recent report from financial services firm UBS said the strong Hong Kong dollar was also hurting the city’s competitiveness in exports. It expected the tourism industry to suffer worse than during the global financial crisis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:27:21.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
