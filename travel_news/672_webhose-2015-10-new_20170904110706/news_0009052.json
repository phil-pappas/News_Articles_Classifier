It was reported that during the in-flight trolley service, he disrupted fellow passengers by singing loudly and constantly using foul and offensive language. He continually disobeyed cabin crew orders and verbally threatened one senior crew member who asked him to calm down.\nFollowing this behaviour, Mr Vincent appeared at Paisley Sheriff Court on 8th October 2015. In addition to the £950 fine he has also been given a lifetime ban by Jet2.com.\nPhil Ward, managing director of Jet2.com, said: “Mr Vincent’s behaviour was without doubt unacceptable. We will not tolerate people threatening to attack our cabin crew and showing no respect towards fellow passengers, who want to relax and enjoy their in-flight experience.\n​\n“This is a very positive outcome for our Onboard Together initiative which we launched this summer to protect both our passengers and crew from offensive and disruptive passenger behaviour. It is something that is affecting the industry as a whole and we are committed to taking the necessary action to stamp it out.”\nInspector Bob Smith, Airport Police Commander, Glasgow Airport, Police Scotland Border Policing Command, added: “The behaviour of this individual on the aircraft could have had serious repercussions for the safety of the other passengers and crew on board the flight.\n \n“Border Policing Command Officers within Police Scotland view such behaviour extremely seriously and are working with all airlines on a daily basis to reduce the impact of disruptive passengers at our airports. Violence, drunkenness and any other form of anti-social behaviour towards crew or passengers will not be tolerated in our airports or onboard aircraft and will be dealt with robustly.\n“By working in partnership with our airports and airlines we will continue to keep staff and members of the public who transit through our airports safe.”\n \nSource:- Jet2.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:28:11.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
