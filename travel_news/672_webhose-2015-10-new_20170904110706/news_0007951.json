When I mentioned I was going, everyone seemed to have an opinion on getting there — small plane, bumpy flight, tiny luggage allowance (14kgs) and in the middle of nowhere. I can safely say they were unfounded, except for the small plane and luggage, which actually set the scene for an epic adventure rather than detracting from it. \nAfter dropping down from the clouds, the towering mountains, Gower and Lidgbird, came into view. The island arcs around a 6km-long bright blue lagoon, bracketed by the most southern coral reef in the world. The water looks like it’s been ‘photoshopped’— it’s a saturated blue and like nothing I’ve seen before in Australia. It’s take-your-breath-away kind of beautiful and we couldn’t wait to get down there. It’s like something out of Jurassic Park. Picture: Stephanie Williams.

The owners Dani and Luke Hansen have recently completed a chic restoration of the property, and the place feels like new. \nWithin half an hour of arriving, my partner, toddler and I are on our bikes and ready to explore. First stop is Ned’s Beach to feed the fish. One dollar buys a handful of fish food and about ten minutes of belly aching laughter for us — dropping fish food at each other’s feet attracting the many eager mullet and wrasse fish to shimmy around our legs. We’re keen to get hiking and spend the afternoon walking up Transit Hill, the peak in the centre of the island with views north and south, and friendly cows along the way. \nAnd then it’s time for the food. You would never guess that fresh produce is only delivered to the island once a fortnight. The Pinetress chef Alasdair Nicolson, ex-Grand National (Sydney), works wonders. The highlight of the week was definitely ‘fish fry’ night, where local kingfish and other seafood are transformed into generous sushi and sashimi platters, followed by grilled and battered fillets with a well-crafted salads and chips. Alasdair’s gorgeous wife Danielle (also a talented baker if you get along to the Sunday markets) is on hand to babysit, so we enjoy a few dinners baby-free too. The view from Kim’s lookout.

Lord Howe acted as a provisioning station for ships travelling between Sydney and Norfolk Island, and for whaling ships. The island was World Heritage listed in 1982 to preserve the rare flora and fauna that has continued to flourish. It helps that only 350 people live on Lord Howe and only another 400 are allowed to visit at any given time. \nDescendants of the first inhabitants still live on the island and real estate ownership is limited — if no islander wants to buy land up for sale, only then can a non-islander buy it. Eco-principles are strictly adhered to, and deliveries of food and supplies arrive by boat every fortnight. Bikes are the best way to get around and shoes feel optional by the time you’re heading home. \nFifth generation islander Dean Hiscox took me for a dive in the lagoon one day, after briefing me about the “awesome” sharks I might see at Erscott’s hole. Eek. \nThe reef is pristine, untouched and well managed. The colours are full on and the water is as clear as it is clean, and packed with so many colourful fish, including the endemic double header wrasse. For the record, a shark was spotted and I stayed calm — by this stage Lord Howe Island had me pretty relaxed. \nWe enlist Danielle’s babysitting services and set ourselves free for a date afternoon at Capella Lodge — a five-star luxury resort in the foothills of the mountains. \nA gourmet lunch of local fish and chips with a cheeky white wine was punctuated by “that” view — soaring Mounts Gower and Lidgbird — moodily draped in misty fog. After lunch we took a peek at the ultra-luxe Lidgbird suite (it comes with it’s own golf buggy for island exploration) and stretched our legs on the gentle 3km walk to Little Island, through ancient forests of banyan trees and endemic kentia palms. \nFrom March to September, you can witness the incredibly rare Providence Petrels fly round the twin peaks here, and if you’re game you can try and call them down like David Attenborough did .

I can safely say, Sir David was right, Lord Howe Island is extraordinary, and has to be experienced to be believed. Could there be a better spot for a family picnic? Picture: Stephanie Williams.
