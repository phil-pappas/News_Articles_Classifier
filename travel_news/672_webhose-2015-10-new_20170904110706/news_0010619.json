They could also indulge in options from the buffet, including potted shrimps, soused herrings, brawn -- a type of jellied meat -- and corned ox tongue.\nAn elaborate platter of eight different types of cheese was served to finish the midday meal.\nNew York-based autograph dealer, Lion Heart Autographs , offered the menu for sale from an unidentified person who it said was a descendent of one of the survivors of the boat. It is one of only three or four menus from the last first-class lunch still in existence and fetched a healthy premium over its estimated $50,000 - $70,000 price tag.\nFurther Titanic items\nJUST WATCHED The sinking of the Titanic revisited 100 years later Replay More Videos ...

It was carrying just over 2,200 passengers and crew, of whom 1,517 died. None of the survivors of the tragedy are alive today, but the disaster -- and its memorabilia -- continue to capture the world's imagination .", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120416015549-welch-titanic-memorial-00000124-story-top.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131021105027-pkg-azuz-titanic-violin-auctioned-00010407-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120416015549-welch-titanic-memorial-00000124-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120416015549-welch-titanic-memorial-00000124-topics.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120416015549-welch-titanic-memorial-00000124-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131021105027-pkg-azuz-titanic-violin-auctioned-00010407-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120416015549-welch-titanic-memorial-00000124-hp-video.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131021105027-pkg-azuz-titanic-violin-auctioned-00010407-topics.jpg", "http://traffic.outbrain.com/network/trackpxl?advid=814&action=view", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131021105027-pkg-azuz-titanic-violin-auctioned-00010407-story-top.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131021105027-pkg-azuz-titanic-violin-auctioned-00010407-hp-video.jpg", "http://www.lionheartautographs.com/titanicauction"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:27:19.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
