(AP File Photo)\nTV bingers who can’t bear to be separated from their favorite programming while on the road can breathe a sigh of relief.\nVirgin America has signed a deal with Netflix that allows subscribers to the video streaming service free Wi-Fi in the skies.\nAccording to a press statement released yesterday, the offer will last until March, 2 2016 and will only be available on planes equipped with the airline’s new ViaSat WiFi, which Virgin America claims delivers Internet speeds up to ten times faster than other Wi-Fi systems provided by competing airlines.\n\"As WiFi becomes more ubiquitous, it's going to be increasingly possible for members to enjoy Netflix wherever they want,\" said Bill Holmes , Netflix's global head of business development.\nMany inflight Wi-Fi services like Gogo do not allow for video streaming. But with Virgin America’s new pilot program, passengers will be able to enjoy Netflix’s entire catalog of television shows, documentaries and feature films. Passengers will be able to access the free W-Fi network through ViaSat by entering in their existing Netflix account details—or creating a new, free 30-day trial account-- which will be a boon to the company’s goal of adding more subscribers.\nAbby Lunardini, Virgin America’s Vice President of Brand Marketing and Communications, said that the new partnership will allow the airline to provide “the largest breadth of streamed content ever available at 35,000 feet.”\nThe move to provide more premium content is in line with moves made by other carriers. In May, JetBlue began offering free streaming to Amazon Prime subscribers.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/now-streaming-netflix--at-35000-feet-virgin-america-teams-up-with-netflix-to-offer-travelers-free-wifi-access-to-the-worlds-leading-internet-tv-network-300150655.html"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:38:15.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
