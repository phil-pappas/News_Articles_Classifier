According to recent research from the Asset Based Finance Association, Britain’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are owed £67.4bn, up 36 per cent from £49.5bn in 2011. The average wait-time for payment is 72 days. Infrastructure technology company Brookvex Technical Services is an expanding business and its fast-growing division Brookvex Eco is currently working with the London Underground where it has already installed telecommunications, electrical and security solutions. “Our core service is contract work,” explains Mike Davidson, managing director of The Brookvex Group. “This often comes with slow payment, and can take an extremely long time.” The UK’s SMEs used to have a great relationship with the high-street banks until the mid-2000s. Credit costs rocketed and smaller companies have lost faith in relying on one bank for help. And the alternative finance sector is booming. By the end of August 2015, the sector had lent around £4.365bn, according to business funding experts Fleximize. Brookvex Technical wanted to ensure that both employees and suppliers could be paid on time while still being able to put money back into the business Increasingly, companies such as Brookvex, without large finance departments or dedicated credit controllers, are turning to alternative financing options such as invoice factoring. In invoice factoring, the factor advances a percentage (up to 90pc) of the value of invoices up-front and collects the balance later on, minus a service charge. The seller is borrowing against its debtors. In invoice discounting, the invoice financier doesn’t manage the sales ledger or collect debts on the company’s behalf. Instead, it lends money against unpaid invoices, usually an agreed percentage of their total value. Then the company pays them a fee. When the customers pay the invoices, the money goes straight to the financier, reducing the amount the SME owes. In invoice discounting, the company is responsible for collecting debts but these can be arranged confidentially. While attracting investors in a funky new startup can be the easy bit, it’s when orders get bigger, workforces grow and premises expand that the problems start and invoice financing and factoring come into their own. Brookvex Technical found it needed a reliable cashflow stream to help with its expansion plans and wanted to ensure that both employees and suppliers could be paid on time while still being able to put money back into the business. So it turned to commercial financial company IGF, which tailored an invoice-finance package that works on a case-by-case basis and has been designed to fit in with Brookvex’s strategy. This relationship has enabled Brookvex to plan and coordinate its growth strategy, continuing to offer a locally based service. Other advantages to factoring include the possibility that some customers might respect a third party a bit more and pay up quicker. Factors can also offer useful information about the credit standing of customers and help to negotiate better terms. Mr Davidson says: “As we began to grow faster and faster, we faced a major challenge in securing a reliable cash-flow stream to help with our expansion plans. IGF analysed the issues facing us – both long and short-term – and offered us a flexible and cost-effective package.” The tailored solutions, says Mr Davidson, “really give us the initial financial lift required to grow the business with the right cash flow under our belt.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • How a business can recover from cybercrime • Build tech to grow your business • Breaking new markets means rethinking your SME • Efficient doctors need IT prescription", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:41:19.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
