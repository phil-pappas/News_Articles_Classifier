The two-day event officially begins this evening (10 October), and the first day will see four cycling races and rides, including the CEO Charity Ride, the Men’s Open Race, the Women’s Open Race and the pièce de résistance – the International Criterium Race – which has attracted over 100 professional cyclists from around the globe. \nOrganised by the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), with Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) as the title and charity sponsor, the brand new mega event is expected to garner international exposure for Hong Kong and reinforce the city’s image as the events capital of Asia. \nThe first programme in the two-day Sun Hung Kai Properties Hong Kong Cyclothon is the CEO Charity Ride, supported by some 20 guests from various sectors, who are keen to spread the spirit of charity, including Mr Gregory So, Secretary for Commerce & Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government; Dr Raymond Kwok, Chairman and Managing Director of Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd; Mr Brian Li, Executive Director and Deputy Chief Executive of The Bank of East Asia, Ltd; Mr Lau Ming Wai, Deputy Chairman of Ocean Park, Hong Kong; Mr Andrew Kam, Managing Director of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort; Mr Winston Chow, Director and Deputy General Manager of Chow Sang Sang Holdings International Ltd; Mr Jason Wong, Director and General Manager of Hong Thai Travel Services Ltd; and Ms Winnie Ng, Director of The Kowloon Motor Bus Co (1933) Limited. \nAnother 110 cyclists will compete in the Men’s Open and Women’s Open criterium races, which feature eight and five laps, respectively. The former has attracted the participation of various personalities in the local professional cycling scene, including Mr Tang Wang Yip, gold medalist in the 2009 East Asian Games Men’s Individual Road Race; Mr Lee Chi Wo, former representative of the Hong Kong triathlon team in the Olympic Games; and Mr Chau Dor Ming, a former member of the Hong Kong Cycling Team. \nAs for the International Criterium Race, the highlight of the day, 100 professional cyclists from 25 local and overseas teams will cycle 25 laps for the championship. \nFour other programs will be held tomorrow morning (11 October), including the 35km Challenge Ride, 10km Community Ride, Kids & Youth Rides and Family Fun Ride. In the 35km Challenge Ride, Tsing Ma Bridge will be open – for the first time for a cycling event – for 1,700 overseas and local cyclists. \nTitle and charity sponsor SHKP has pledged a 3-to-1 matching fund for all money raised, meaning for every HK$1 donated by participants, SHKP will donate HK$3. It is expected that a total of HK$3 million will be raised, which will be donated to The Boys’ and Girls’ Clubs Association of Hong Kong, and to Mother’s Choice and The Salvation Army via The Community Chest of Hong Kong for welfare programs targeted at children and youths in need. \nAltogether over 3,600 visitors and local residents are participating in the various cycling races and rides in the 2015 Sun Hung Kai Properties Hong Kong Cyclothon. Meanwhile, a cycling carnival is being staged at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre Piazza in Tsim Sha Tsui, with booths selling food, beverages and cycling accessories, as well as games and live music performances. Members of the public are welcome to visit the family-friendly carnival and enjoy the cycling-themed day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:49:10.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
