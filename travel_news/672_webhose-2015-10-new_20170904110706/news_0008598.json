The month of August witnessed a total revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) rise of 7.1% compared to 2014.\nThe International Passenger Markets reported an encouraging growth with the Middle East airlines reporting the maximum rise of demand followed by the Asia-Pacific carriers.\nAugust international passenger demand rose 7.1% compared to the same month last year, with airlines in all regions recording growth, led by Middle East carriers. Total capacity climbed 5.8% pushing load factor up 1.0 percentage point to 85.2%.\nAsia-Pacific airlines’ August traffic surged 7.7% compared to the year-ago period. Capacity rose 5.8% and load factor increased 1.5 percentage points to 82.5%. While emerging Asia has experienced notable declines in trade activity this year as well as slower than expected growth in China, neither factor appears to be impacting international air travel on the region’s carriers.\nEuropean carriers saw traffic increase by 5.7%. Economic recovery in the Eurozone is supporting demand for international travel. Capacity climbed 4.1% and load factor rose 1.3 percentage points to 88.3%, highest among the regions.\nNorth American airlines’ traffic rose 4.5% year-over-year. Capacity climbed 3.7% and load factor rose 0.6 percentage points to 87.2%. Expectations for better economic performance are supporting demand for air travel in the region.\nMiddle East carriers’ August demand jumped 13.7% over the same month in 2014. Major economies in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have experienced slowdowns in non-oil sectors but the growth rates remain robust. Capacity nearly kept pace at 13.5% and load factor edged up 0.1 percentage points to 83.7%.\nLatin American airlines experienced a 6.7% rise in traffic compared to August a year ago. Capacity exceeded demand at 7.1% and load factor slipped 0.3 percentage points to 82.0%. Latin America was the only region to see a decline in load factors. Despite recessionary conditions in Brazil and Argentina, improving regional trade volumes provided a boost to business-related international travel.\nAfrican airlines’ traffic rose 3.6% in August year-to-year, which was the slowest growth among the regions but the second consecutive month of growth. Capacity increased 2.9%, with the result that load factor improved 0.5 percentage points to 75.2%. Adverse economic developments in parts of the continent including Nigeria, the largest economy, suggest that Africa will continue to experience weak growth at best.\nThe latest report helps us to conclude that despite oscillating fiscal conditions in various parts of the world the demand of air traveling remains strong. 2015 is all set to make a record as the airline industry remains on its toes to welcome the winter holiday season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:05:20.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
