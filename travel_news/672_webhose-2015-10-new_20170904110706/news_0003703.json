For this article the focus is on Chamonix Mont-Blanc. \nNestled between the mirror-smooth Lake Geneva and the regal Alps, Geneva airport is one of the most popular places to fly in to for those travelling onwards to Alpine ski resorts. The airport is also one of Europe’s best served by budget airlines, making it very convenient for ski enthusiasts. As part of a series on the region’s best ski resorts, for this article the focus is on arguably the world’s most famous place for skiing near Geneva: Chamonix Mont-Blanc.Why We Love ItChamonix is legendary in the skiing world, and is certainly one of the most popular destinations for those interested in skiing near Geneva. It spans a range of heights, from 1035-3842 metres, giving it almost unparalleled diversity: depending on weather conditions and times of year, runs will be at their best at different stages, meaning that there’s always more to explore at this renowned resort.Chamonix has a wide range of pistes to cater to all levels of skill. This, combined with its variation in heights and the fact that it spans five mountains, means that there’s truly something for every kind of skier here. While the diversity of pistes makes Chamonix an excellent choice for large parties of varying abilities, what keeps people coming back to this resort is the truly magnificent off-piste skiing.Hire a guide and spend some time away from the pistes, exploring the natural splendour of the rugged, snow-blanketed and glacier-scarred mountains. The off-piste skiing at Chamonix has frequently been described as some of the best in the world, and exploring the wild snowscape is a true adventure. Among the most famous runs is the Valley Blanche, an off-piste run that stretches for 20km, allowing you to really hit your stride.What We Don’t LoveDue to its international reputation, Chamonix is often crowded, and you may find the more popular pistes tracked out early in the day. For a more personal, isolated Alpine feel, there are other resorts, so if you’re after a more intimate atmosphere you may wish to look into some of the other opportunities for skiing near Geneva.The near-mythical status of the resort often attracts people wishing to prove themselves and collect war stories, which, while making for a thrilling atmosphere for some, can prove too competitive for others.
