I had known for some time that while Ken had battled and beaten prostate cancer, doctors had discovered spots on his liver. Normally, all conversations with Ken were full of one-liners and short bursts of laughter. This call was decidedly different. My longtime friend and colleague needed to ask a favor. Strapped to a hospital bed with tubes delivering chemo and steroids, Ken was wondering if I could speak for him — the following morning. I told him I’d take care of it. He said, “Great, ’cause it’s at 8 a.m. at the Harbour Club, downtown Charleston and there’s no way I’m gonna be out of here.” All through his prostate battles, he was upbeat and sure of victory. This day was very different. The breathing was labored. The tone was quite serious, with barely a moment to ask if there was any additional news regarding his situation. Like any good reporter, he wanted to get right to the matter without dancing around the subject. “Warren, right now I’m hoping I can make it to Christmas.” I’d known for a while of the circumstances, but nothing prepared me for how quickly his condition had deteriorated. Most of our conversations, through the years, concerned these topics: our children, our jobs and our golf games. Stories of our children seemed to be the most uplifting. I spoke to the group that next morning. I didn’t give them too many specifics, just that he sent his regrets and was in the hospital. Dr. Google Ken’s abilities as a writer are well-known and admired. After nearly 40 years in the newspaper business, primarily as a columnist, he then wrote three novels and was working on his fourth. He always had something to say, but what made him different was how he said it. We knew about his life because he told us about it, warts and all. We knew he was divorced four times and a recovering alcoholic. He spoke frankly about dropping out of college, then returning to graduate. He was an ex-smoker. He found ways to connect many of his personal battles to our own. His Southern sensibilities from little Allendale, S.C., translated into stories of triumph and tragedy no matter where he traveled. During a recent visit, I commented on how much his wife, Bonnie, knew about what medicine or food or procedure or protocol might be applied. He shrugged his shoulders and said, “I just call her Dr. Google. Give her a moment with her phone and she’ll come up with an answer or suggestion.” This was not said in a dismissive manner. Ken and Bonnie have been inseparable these past few years. When I saw him last, he was wearing a T-shirt that said simply, “I love my wife.” Say it now From 1990 to 2004, Ken and I spent every football season telling people, via television and the newspaper, who would win certain games that Saturday. Our ad-libbed Pigskin Picks, totally unscripted, developed a popular following. Neither one of us knew what the other would say or predict, but we laughed our way through it. Ken approached life a little bit like that. It rarely appeared that anything bothered him. It was important that he always be on time. If he’d written something critical or less than flattering about a coach, he’d make a point to be at the next game or news conference. His job was to be there, not to hide. So many of his press box buddies have come calling in recent weeks. Even through the shortness of breath and sometime scattered thoughts brought on by the medicine, this was his request. “If you’re planning to write an obit, do it now so I can read it.” The visits, good wishes and well-crafted words on his behalf in the past few weeks are, in large part, directly proportional to the many acts of kindness he demonstrated along the way. Ken, I’m flattered that you asked me to speak for you ... but nobody will ever write like you. And to cap it off, you might just have been a better friend than a writer.
