Organised by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB)from 19 to 23 October, the business events week will see a comprehensive line-up of speakers and events expounding on the trends and issues facing the travel ecosystem. \nMr Andrew Phua, Director of Exhibitions and Conferences,Singapore Tourism Board, said, “Launched in 2010, TravelRave has been shining the spotlight onAsian travel and tourism as a one-stop platform for industry professionals to gain strategic knowledge and insights into the region’s multi-faceted environment.TravelRave 2015 continues to catalyse business networking and travel innovations with a concentration of eventsthat showcasesnew and exciting developments in Asia’stravel industry.” TravelRave 2015 Presenting Asian-focused insights across travel sectors from hospitality, luxurytravel, aviation, and technology, TravelRave 2015 highlights include: • Web in Travel (WIT) 2015 Conference will kick-start the week with provoking discussions aimed at redefining the boundaries in travel, • ITB Asia, the anchor event of TravelRave, will host the show’s first ‘Luxury Travel & Hospitality Forum (LTHF)’’; and • Hotel Management Summit Singapore, co-located with the Hotel Technology Conference, will highlight game-changing travel trends disrupting the industry and what hoteliers can do. Complementing TravelRave 2015 again is the Asia Travel Leaders Summit (ATLS),a by-invite-only event organised by STB that brings together leading industry players to discuss travel trends of the region through the theme, “Frontiers in Focus”. The week will also celebrate the best in Asian tourism with two of TravelRave’s awards events, the TravelRave Leaders GalaandSingapore Experience Awards. Moving Forward: Asia’s New Tourism Landscape STB first conceptualised TravelRave as a platform for industry professionals to springboard into Asia,and better understand the evolving needs of travellers in the region. TravelRave has since helped catalysethe growth of travel and tourism business events by clustering complementary ones together, especially those with an Asian perspective. “Asia’s tourism landscape has evolved quickly and extensively since 2010. The events within TravelRave havealso grown in tandem, with each componentevent developingto become an important pillar of their respective sectors today, such that a single week can no longer accommodate all of them,” said Mr Lionel Yeo, Chief Executive, Singapore Tourism Board (STB). 2015sawthe inaugural Aviation Festival Asia in February, as well as the annualAsia Meeting & Incentives Travel Exchange (AMITE)which is co-located underthe Singapore MICE Forum in July.The upcomingeditions ofITB Asiaand WIT Conferencehave also grown to encompass broadercomponents of the travel spectrum. 2016 will see Singapore hosta year-long line-upof exciting travel and tourism events, much more than what a single week of TravelRave can traditionally deliver. Aviation Festival Asia returns to start the year together with homegrown conference Food&HotelAsia in April and regionally-recognised TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition & Conference in May. This is followed by AMITEand theSingapore MICE Forumin July. ITB Asia, WIT Conference and other events will continue in October, and are poised to grow without the umbrella branding of TravelRave. New entrants to Singapore including the Asia Pacific Airline Training Symposium (APATS) 2016 and Incentive, Conference & Event Society Asia-Pacific (ICESAP)2016will further complement mainstay events as well, echoing the many verticals in today’s dynamic and diverse travel industry. Mr Yeo added, “The demand for travel-related business events is growing strongly to support the bright outlook of tourismin Asia. The Singapore Tourism Board is proud that TravelRave has helped to catalyse this growth and thereare now other emerging clusters of such events acrossthe calendar year,withthe potential for more to develop.We thereforewelcome the opportunity to support the growth of traveland tourismevents in Singapore throughout the year, and not just in October.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:30:52.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
