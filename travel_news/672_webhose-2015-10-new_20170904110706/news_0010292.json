Focusing on leisure travelers, the new flights will bring nearly 9,000 additional visitors each year to the Fort Lauderdale area and generate over an estimated $7 million in total visitor spending annually.\n“The Broward County Aviation Department welcomes Allegiant’s new service and doubling in growth year-over-year, at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. We wish them continued success as they pursue new markets for travelers to visit Broward County,” said Kent George, Broward County Aviation director of aviation.\nNew routes launching to Fort Lauderdale / Hollywood International Airport (FLL) include:\nPortsmouth, N.
