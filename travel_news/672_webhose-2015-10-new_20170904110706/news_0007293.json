This huge market in the region was mainly due to large-scale domestic production, government initiatives and availability of resources.

Overall, the automotive die casting market in North America has a potential scope of growth with the die casting capacity utilization ahead of overall manufacturing utilization.\nDependence of the automobile manufacturers on the environmental agency regulations and a recent move by EPA of raising the mile per gallons standards to 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 and then 54.5 mpg by 2025 actually helped the die casting industry as the auto industry concluded the only way they can get to those mileage standards is by light weighting the vehicles.\nRules levied by OSHA and initiatives by NADCA to improve the technical workforce in the die casting industry is expected to improve the overall production of the die casting market and in turn, the market for automotive parts die casting.
