In total, 25,000 jobs could be created by the project, it claimed. \nEDF said the £18 billion cost estimate for Hinkley was the amount that would have been spent by the time the project is completed, including the effects of inflation over the decade-long construction period. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said this was in line with a previous £16 billion estimate it had given, which had been expressed in 2012 prices. \nA £24.5 billion estimate from the European Commission was now “irrelevant” as that was based on an old funding model that EDF had now abandoned, it said. \nThe company had planned to take out up to £16 billion in project financing loans using taxpayer-backed guarantees offered by the Chancellor. Under its new funding model, it may now only use an initial £2 billion loan guarantee announced last month. \nAmber Rudd, the energy secretary, said: “The UK is open for business and this is a good deal for everyone Hinkley Point C will continue to meet our robust safety regulations and will power nearly six million households with low-carbon energy, creating over 25,000 jobs and more financial security for working people and their families.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:08:17.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
