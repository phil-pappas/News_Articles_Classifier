Drones are extensively used by Syria, the coalition against the Islamic State (spearheaded by the US) and Russia. \nImages of the drone that have been made public appear to contain a small non-military model plane, according to Turkish media. The aircraft was shot down after three warnings had been issued, which means the downing had happened according to the “rules of engagement”. \nThe origin of the drone remains unclear. Turkish officials have accused Russia of violating Turkey’s air space in the past weeks, which could have happened as a result of Russia’s involvement in the fight against Syrian rebel group. A US official had also been quoted by Reuters saying that he suspects it had been a Russian drone, but declined expanding. \nRussia declines any involvement in the incident, claiming that all operations in Syria have been running uninterrupted, and all planes in Syria have returned to base safe. The intrusions were also condemned by NATO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:58:45.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
