Also on my plate are two warm lamingtons, freshly dipped in chocolate and smothered in desiccated coconut. \n\"They're actually catching on in Chengdu. The other day I saw some green tea-flavoured lamos in a local bakery,\" Darren Greenwood, the executive chef of Temple House, a new luxury boutique hotel, says. \nYes, he called them lamos. The endearing Victorian-born chef serves the Australasian fare together with cuisine with a more local influence at the Temple House Cafe, one of three restaurants in the stylishly designed hotel, which cleverly incorporates tradition by utilising a Qing dynasty-era courtyard with bold modern architecture. \nThe Temple House Teahouse. Image: Supplied \nThose behind the Temple House were deliberate in deciding not to include a traditional Sichuan hotpot restaurant as part of their venture. \n\"[It] would be a bit like bringing a bucket of sand to the beach,\" Greenwood says. \nIn 2010, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation selected Chengdu as the first City of Gastronomy in Asia, ahead of other foodie destinations such as Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong. But in a city that is turning into a high-tech economic powerhouse with a population that has exploded to 14 million, a food revolution of sorts is taking place. \nWhile authentic Sichuan roots still prevail across the 40,000-plus eateries in the city, a melange of international fusions and flavours is edging in on the dining scene. \n\"Two years ago, when I moved here, there were a handful of Western restaurants,\" Temple House general manager Mark Passmore, a British expat, says. \n\"Now there are two-to-three hundred.\" \n*Images of when airline food goes right \nTaikoo Li is an architecturally designed development in the Jinjiang district of Chengdu.

Here there are upscale and well-known brands (Hermes, Chloe, Muji, Zara), a giant bookshop in the basement (Fang Suo Commune featuring two 100-metre-long book displays) and a range of restaurants. Green Tea serves Zhejiang cuisine with a modern twist, Taiwan's Din Tai Fung is famous for its soup dumplings and the Temple House has Tivano, an Italian restaurant with a two-level wood oven hearth. \nOn the menu is marinated octopus, caprese with mozzarella flown in from Italy, gnocchi alla cagliata and a salame picante pizza. \n\"Italian food seemed the obvious choice,\" chef de cuisine Domenico Bio says. \n\"Pasta is like noodles and [similar to a Chinese banquet] you can have share plates.\" \nLocals with money are filling up the private dining rooms and taking advantage of the extensive wine list. \nBut the famous \"numbing and hot\" combination of chillies and Sichuan peppercorns is always nearby. The Taikoo Li restaurant Fun Fondue is marketed as the younger version of Huang Cheng Lao Ma, a famous hotpot restaurant – but with a milder soup base. And at Temple House's Teahouse, a Sichuan organic vegetarian menu is served. \n\"The food concept for the Teahouse evolved quite naturally, being on the former grounds of the Daci Temple,\" Greenwood says. \n\"The abundance of quality, locally grown produce made it possible.\" \nSitting down for lunch next to monks sipping tea, we sample marinated black wood ear fungus, bamboo shoots in red oil, cold tofu with tea eggs and Sichuan cold noodles. Bowls of tea temper any hotness. \n\"There are also a lot of small, grassroots, owner-operated restaurants, cafes and bars popping up all over Chengdu,\" Greenwood says. \n\"Chengdu has always had a great food culture, but people are looking for new experiences.\" \nXiao long bao dumplings.

Renowned food writer, and the first female chef to ever train at the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine, Fuchsia Dunlop thinks Yu Zhi Lan is Michelin star-worthy. Chef Lan Guijun​ blends Sichuanese cooking with Japanese precision; he might marinate cod Japanese-style then add local seasoning. Bookings are by appointment only. \nNearby, in the Wide and Narrow Alleys, among the imperial-era architecture is Yu's Family Kitchen. Behind the red door, self-taught chef Yu Bo concocts about 30 courses of Sichuan seasonal produce. There's no menu, but his signature creation Crispy Calligraphy Brushes is a staple. The long shortbread sticks are filled with dry meat floss and the ink is a tomato-based dipping sauce. \nIn the alleys, we sit down for some campy and comical Sichuan opera at a restaurant called Impressions of Chengdu. Swirling on the lazy Susan is water boiled fish, tofu and beef, all packed with peppercorns and chillies. Somehow, the combination brings about a variety of flavours – it's fiery, smoky, sweet and salty. Each bite is chased with a sip of unpasteurised Tsingtao beer, which arrives in a thermos covered in a brown paper bag. There's a mantra here when eating: \"scald, then cool, scald, then cool\". \nOutside, tourists and locals are shopping in the alleys. The waft of the aromatic \"pock-marked grandmother tofu\" from one of the street carts is too good not to sample, and the silken cubes with hot and numbing sauce prove delicious. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:05:53.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
