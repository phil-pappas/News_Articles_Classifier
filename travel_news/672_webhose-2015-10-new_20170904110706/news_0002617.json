Downhill skating was just in its beginning stages, and I just rode that wave.”\nThe 30-year-old from Mesa still is plunging down hills on longboards, one of the fastest-growing trends in skating sports.\nThese days, longboarders can be found on hills all around the state, including winding descents near Jerome, Payson, Tucson, Flagstaff and Sedona.\nA favorite Valley spot is Summit Road on South Mountain or “SOMO,” as they like to call it. The skaters take turns shuttling in vehicles to a spot about 2½ miles up the mountain and then let gravity do its magic.\nThey estimate they travel up to 35 miles per hour down Summit Road. Although there are other roads on which they approach 40-45 mph, SOMO is challenging enough to attract skaters from other parts of the country. The word spreads quickly about such hotspots, with an active skating community sharing favorite places to ride on Facebook groups and websites.\nAZCENTRAL\nNovember Project fitness group blossoms in Phoenix\nLike many others, Sharp started out on much easier hills.\n“We all start out with that first little hill in our neighborhood, getting road rash there,” he said. “And parking garages are a good place to learn after everybody leaves because you can take the elevator back up to the top.”\nThe skaters look daredevilish swooping down South Mountain, crouched low on their boards, arms tucked behind their backs to eliminate wind resistance.\nFor now, Summit Road closed In August, a monsoon storm damaged South Mountain Park's Summit Road for the second year in a row. The road is closed at the 1-mile marker just past the ranger station.\nRanger Elizabeth Smith said Summit Road is closed indefinitely, but a new gate is being added on Summit at the San Juan triangle parking area.\nThe gate will allow park officials to re-open the road to the San Juan triangle and allow bicyclists and runners or walkers onto San Juan Road. Updates will be posted at phoenix.gov/parks/trails/locations/south-mountain .\nThe closure means a little more driving for local longboarders such as Mike Altenhofen of Phoenix.\n\"Camelback Mountain is probably the closest alternative,\" he said. \"But other mountain roads we tend to ride include Mount Lemmon, Mount Graham, the Pinal Mountains and Mingus Mountain.\"\nBut the skaters describe the SOMO experience as “mellow,” especially compared with steeper, more technical descents in longboarding hotspots such as Malibu Canyon in Southern California.\nMike Altenhofen, 22, said he started in his Ahwatukee Foothills neighborhood on the opposite side of South Mountain, then came across YouTube videos of skaters on Summit Road.\n“We took our first runs about five years ago,” he said. “It was really scary my first couple of times, but now it’s smooth sailing. It’s a lot of fun.”\nEd Lynn, a 24-year-old from Mesa, said the reactions longboarders get from hikers, bikers and runners on the mountain vary.\n“There’s always that one guy who used to ride skateboards and is fascinated,” he said, laughing. “We get all kinds of reactions. A lot of them think we’re crazy, but I think it’s crazy to get on a bike and pedal all the way up this thing.”\nThe skaters emphasize that what looks crazy is surprisingly safe. They get the occasional road rash, but all wear safety equipment, including helmets. And they wear leather gloves with plastic skid disks attached to the palms to control their speed and create drag that smooths out turns.\nThe road is in South Mountain Park, and Sharp said it took some convincing for park rangers to allow skaters to ride there.\n“I don’t think they were too happy about it at first,” Sharp said. “They didn’t outright say no, but we’d get two or three runs in and they would say, “Time for you guys to go now.”\nOne day, Sharp said, a park ranger stopped them as they were coming down.\nFrom left: Ed Lynn, Mike Altenhofen and Chris Sharp longboard, July 16, 2015, down Summit Road in South Mountain Park, Phoenix. (Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic)\n“He saw how we can slide to a stop, foot brake and maneuver,” he said. “We talked to him about it, and he called in to somebody above him and got the word that as long as we weren’t doing anything wrong, controlled ourselves and stayed in our lane, it’s all good. From there, we had the OK to skate here.”\nGregg Bach, a spokesman for Phoenix Parks and Recreation, said rangers have worked with skating groups to make sure they know what is expected.\n“We try to keep up with these trends and embrace them,” he said. “We never used to have skate parks, either, but we have those now. Our rangers work with them on it and feel comfortable enough having them out there.\n“It’s no different than someone on a bike or a horse or whatever. As long as you follow the rules and are respectful of other users, we are comfortable with it.”\nAltenhofen said, “All the rangers are cool with us being here as long as they see us staying in our lane and wearing our safety gear. They never hassle us or give us any problems.”\nSharp estimates there are about 50 local skaters who ride South Mountain, and there have been groups of a dozen or more riding at a time — both men and women.\nBut he said those who want to skate SOMO and similar hills need to make sure they have the skills for it.\n“Honestly, don’t come here first,” he said.\nAZCENTRAL\nBob Young: Virtual runs let you compete on your own terms\nAltenhofen suggested that newer skaters try South Mountain on a Silent Sunday — typically the fourth Sunday of each month. On those days, no vehicle traffic is allowed. Skaters can’t shuttle up in a car, but Altenhofen said beginners can walk far enough up the hill to practice. The lower portion of the hill is flatter and straighter, better for newbies.\n“Silent Sunday’s the best time to learn here,” he said, adding that before skaters try South Mountain they should be capable of executing a complete stop on their board. There are numerous video tutorials on skating websites, including skatephx.com .\n“If someone wants to skate an open-mountain road, they need to be able to shut down their skateboard and themselves to a complete stop,” Altenhofen said. “A car could cut a corner or there could be some sort of an emergency that happens, like a car breaking down in a blind corner. You have to be able to shut down or you could go flying right into it.”\nLynn, who started skating in 2009, said a newcomer can purchase a good longboard for $150-$200.\n“There are cheaper options out there, but you want something that will last you awhile,” he said. “The safety gear is another $50-$60. So it’s not expensive to get started, but if you start racing, it gets a little expensive. Leathers can run $1,200.”\nLeathers, he explained, are racing suits, not unlike those worn for motorcycle racing, “but modified to fit what we do.”\nFrom left: Chris Sharp, Ed Lynn and Mike Altenhofen longboard, July 16, 2015, down Summit Road in South Mountain Park, Phoenix. (Photo: Mark Henle/The Republic)\nSharp said he took enough lumps during his BMX biking days to learn the value of wearing proper safety equipment. He added that experienced skaters won’t skate with those who don’t wear helmets and padding on South Mountain or any open road.\n“I’ve hit my head enough times,” he said. “I even stopped wearing half-cut helmets and only wear full-face helmets now. My nose and teeth are pretty valuable. I’m keeping them as long as possible.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ddc5d5e0bebe97c31c264eba88d9bfcb412391b3/c=875-0-3033-2158/local/-/media/2015/09/18/Phoenix/Phoenix/635781988229444474-lacesandleashes1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798990809491777-PNI-0716-south-mountain-skaters004.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4251d33cea40ac6c571b80946b9a901360e5eb37/c=204-0-3396-2400&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798990809491777-PNI-0716-south-mountain-skaters004.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798990778603381-PNI-0716-south-mountain-skaters003.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798990778603381-PNI-0716-south-mountain-skaters003.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/64359972f681df01f21ea78d31ab85d74930b790/c=665-0-2952-2287/local/-/media/2015/09/30/Phoenix/Phoenix/635792103075128079-jackieknoll.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798990809491777-PNI-0716-south-mountain-skaters004.jpg", "http://skatephx.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/307b44fbf7617ea29cd2e7543cd873cc5c1723ac/c=403-0-3595-2400&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798990778603381-PNI-0716-south-mountain-skaters003.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:13:12.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
