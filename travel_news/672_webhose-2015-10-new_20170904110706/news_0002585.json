The demure redesign raised eyebrows in London, and subsequent prattle flushed out the last uninitiated readers, myself included. The book is irresistible, of course—all polished horse tack and aristocratic scandal in the Cotswolds. Cooper sells the glamorous equestrian better than a Ralph Lauren ad. Five pages in and I wondered idly where my riding crop was gathering dust. Twenty pages and I phoned Lucknam Park , an equestrian estate two hours from London. At the next opportunity my better half and I were on our way.\nMotoring into the county of Wiltshire, the landscape unspools into gentle green hills and the kind of stone villages used for Agatha Christie adaptations. The pubs are snug, the cottages are thatched, and—“look, I get it,” you finally mutter, surveying the downy sheep blinking sweetly in a nearby pasture. This pastoral corner of England is home to Lucknam Park, 500 acres surrounding a Palladian mansion built in 1720.\nThe gates to the estate open into a towering tree-lined drive planted nearly 200 years ago. Horses graze in a stretch of countryside to the right of the road, looking up as you roll past. At the top of the avenue sits an unusually beautiful Georgian manor, its wide first-floor windows partially covered by climbing vines. The entrance hall offers a warm impression of deep armchairs and heavily laid fireplaces; there are spare Wellington boots by the door and backgammon boards on the side tables. Dogs are welcome, and more than one fellow guest has a spaniel napping at their ankles.\nThe bedrooms are comfortable and traditional, with heavy pile carpets and deep tubs. Some have a sweeping view from the front of the house, taking in the approach and grounds. The property is an all-rounder; there’s a Michelin-starred restaurant, a spa, and a cookery school. But the most unique feature is the equestrian facility. The Lucknam Park stables house 35 horses and a well-regarded riding school, where locals and Jilly Cooper–reading dilettantes train in dressage, show jumping, and equine care, in addition to the usual walk-trot-canter lessons.\nFollowing a good night’s sleep and a full English breakfast (taken in the dining room or in bed, as mood dictates), you’ll shake out your jodhpurs and walk to the stables, which are a stone’s throw from the hotel. The options for riding depend on experience and inclination, though most guests are beginners and the most popular choice is an instructional ride around the estate. The horses are calm and easy to manage; the school is intended to be accessible for novices, and even first-time riders should feel comfortable.\nMy husband and I keep the same horses for the duration of our visit, a Cleveland Bay with a fantastically long stride and an inky Thoroughbred-Welsh cross. We brush the horses down and receive a few pointers on form (both of us having more enthusiasm than polish) before turning toward the countryside for the first time. Riding through the grounds, in woodland and open fields, is a timeless joy. We make observations between runs: fawns in the tall grass, a growing orchard. Before a particularly expansive stretch of lawn is a sign indicating that riders can have a gallop there if they like, and we do, inelegant and exhilarated.\nThe allure of the riding holiday is similar to that of skiing or hiking: The activity is a rush and the wind-down more glorious for the exertion. But there is an abiding romance to being on horseback that enriches the sport. And if we forget how come-hither those velvet riding hats are, Jilly is there to remind us.\nOther places to visit in Wiltshire:\nThough the Lucknam Park estate feels bucolic, it is a 20-minute drive from the honey-colored city of Bath, which is well worth a day’s exploration. Stop in at The Fine Cheese Co. café for a small glass of wine and a slice of Stichelton, and then walk on to Mr B’s Emporium of Reading Delights , one of the finest bookshops in England, where you can find advice on which novel to read next. The Roman Baths are the city’s primary tourist attraction, and tours are available seven days a week.\nThe local towns of Castle Combe and Lacock, both minutes away by car, are beautiful villages to tour on foot. A bit farther afield, Stonehenge is an easy hour’s drive, and Salisbury Cathedral —one of the more breathtaking sights in the country—is an hour and 15 minutes from Lucknam Park.", "external_links": ["http://www.finecheese.co.uk/shop-in-bath/", "http://www.mrbsemporium.com/", "http://www.romanbaths.co.uk/", "https://www.lucknampark.co.uk/", "http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/", "http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/", "http://www.jillycooper.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:03:57.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
