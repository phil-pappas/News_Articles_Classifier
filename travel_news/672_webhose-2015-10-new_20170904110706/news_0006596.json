These and other episodes are at the heart of “Safari” (Harper), Mr. Kent’s recently released memoir that charts his extraordinary travels beginning at birth: He was delivered while his parents were on safari in what is now Zambia. With them in Kenya in 1962, he founded Abercrombie & Kent, “a name for the company that will both sound grand and put us at the top of the Yellow Pages,” he writes. Combining adventure and pampering, the company today offers 350 tours in more than 100 countries. At 73, Mr. Kent remains a passionate explorer active in conservation projects, including working to save the endangered bonobo apes in Congo. The following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Kent. Q. You believe conservation and tourism can work hand in hand yet the primatologist Dian Fossey disagreed with you. Why? A. I believe totally in sustainable, nature-based tourism. By that I mean bringing guests to the area to see the animals and pay license fees to the local community, bringing income and jobs. People protect those things that they love. Dian wanted only scientists, her argument being that if I brought tourists there, the animals could catch a disease or become too friendly with humans and make the poacher’s job easier. We’ve proved 100 percent that I was correct in Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable Forest where we’ve built a hospital and cut infant mortality 50 percent. Above all, the local tribes protect gorillas there with a vengeance. Now those gorillas represent half of the gorillas left in the world. Their greatest threat is loss of habitat to farming. If locals can’t earn money through protection, they will destroy their habitat to farm. African people are like us. They have to wake up and feed their families. Photo Geoffrey Kent. How has travel changed since you started the company? Back when I started A&K, very few people traveled on vacation. Now because of airlines, a massive amount of people are traveling. Also it used to be couples, or two couples traveling together. Now it’s families and multi-generations. They want activities and experiences and life-changing moments in cultures with people around the world and sometimes achieving great things, like climbing Kilimanjaro. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:34:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
