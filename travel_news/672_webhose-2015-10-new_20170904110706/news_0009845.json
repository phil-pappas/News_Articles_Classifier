Held in the Goldsmiths Hall near St Paul’s Cathedral, it’s touted as one of the major design and jewellery events in the makers’ calendar. The event, which has been running for 32 years, provides a platform for up-and-coming businesses and artists to exhibit their work alongside established craftsmen, and find buyers for their wares. I went along for the opening of the first week to find out who was there, what they were selling and whether it really can be a strong sales channel for makers. Is all that glisters really the Goldsmiths effect? There are around 70 makers exhibiting each week at the venue, a mix of jewellery makers, silversmiths and goldsmiths. Some makers, like Mary Ann Simmons , who has exhibited 14 times at the fair, are old hands, but there are graduates, too, and winners of a bursary competition. If you don’t get out of your workshop and show what you do, people won’t know you’re there “The Goldsmiths Fair is a highlight for me, because I know that the people who walk in are informed about what they will see,” says Ms Simmons. “They are expecting precious metals and lots of people come to buy there and then.” Competition to exhibit at the fair is fierce – there were an estimated 250 applications for 2015. “It’s the hardest show to get into, because they only accept top makers,” says Chris Boland . “It’s also the most reasonably priced show for what you get.” The package costs between £800 and £1,300, depending on whether you receive a first-timer discount, and the price includes photography and promotion. The fair attracts a diverse crowd of buyers. There are young women looking to buy trinkets for friends; people looking for Christmas presents for spouses; serious collectors and retailers looking for new lines. Nina Bukvic , who makes eye-catching woven jewellery, was approached by a buyer from a leading Hong Kong department store. “They want to carry my line when they expand into the US,” she says. “That’s something I never would have expected.” Most of the exhibitors came away making a profit, they tell me, although it’s hard to work out how much, because the show has a long tail. “I had a few small sales, mostly only up to £1,000,” says Miriam Hanid , a Suffolk-based silversmith. “But my income will mostly come from commissions, people spending a few thousand on pieces that meet their requirements.” It’s the hardest show to get into, because they only accept top makers Most of the exhibitors will have at least one piece costing around £100, but the fair also gives them the opportunity to talk about why more expensive designs have been given their price tag. “My most expensive piece of work at the fair was £18,000, because it was technically challenging,” says Ms Simmons. “Customers ask you how long things take, what it’s made of. It’s an opportunity to talk about your craft.” The timing of the fair is key. It’s close enough to Christmas to cater to the gift market – many exhibitors make Christmas decorations and these have become collectors’ items. It is also next to London Fashion Week in the calendar, which means that lots of people who have come for the catwalk will drop by. “I do other craft fairs around the country, but it’s the only one where you get the really high-end buyers,” said Mr Boland, who has introduced more gold and diamonds into his jewellery this year to meet demand. Nearly 10,000 visitors pass through the fair over the two-week period, which is more potential customers than many makers will see throughout the rest of the year. “If you don’t get out of your workshop and show what you do, people won’t know you’re there,” says Ms Simmons. “That’s what’s invaluable about Goldsmiths.” • For more advice on preparing your business for the tech challenges of the future, visit HP BusinessNow You may also be interested in: • Should small businesses borrow money to grow? • A first sight of the Small Business Saturday 100 • How to pitch to a Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist • Set your people free with the ultimate in flexible working • Confessions of a crowdfunder • MPs unaware of Government help for small businesses", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:59:30.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
