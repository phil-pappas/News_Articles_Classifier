It's easy to browse for hours in the maze of second-hand clothes, African drums, tie-dye shirts, antique rugs and furniture and bric-a-brac of all kinds. Unlike most markets in Amsterdam, bargaining isn't necessarily frowned upon here. Location: Waterlooplein (near Stadhuis-Muziektheater complex)Open: Year-round, Monday - Saturday 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. See a picture of Waterlooplein Flea Market . Spui Book Market \nBibliophiles will marvel at the endless tables and tents of this used and antique book market. Dealer collections run the gamut from biography, literature, poetry and fantasy-fiction to art, history, psychology and geography. While most books are from the Netherlands, some English and international titles are for sale, as well as antique maps, prints and records. Location: Spui (between Kalverstraat and Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal)Open: Year-round, Fridays 10 a.m. - 6 p.m. \nWares at this popular market range from tote bags made from old World War II army gear to fine Asian antiques. Die-hard flea-market shoppers get here quite early, especially on Mondays. Location: Noordermarkt (next to the Noorderkerk in the Jordaan)Open: Year-round, Mondays 9 a.m. - 1 p.m., Saturdays 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. See a picture of Noordermarkt Flea Market , Antiekmarkt Nieuwmarkt \nIf you're frustrated by Amsterdam stores closed on Sundays, get your shopping fix at this popular antique and flea market . Location: Nieuwmarkt (in the Old City Center)Open: May - October, Sundays 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Amsterdam's Best Farmers' Markets Boerenmarkt on Noordermarkt \nAlongside the popular flea market on Noordermarkt is one of Amsterdam's biggest biologische (organic) farmers' markets. Local and regional growers sell fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables, meats and cheeses, while organic bakers offer all-natural breads, cookies and pastries. There are even stalls dedicated to organic olive oils, whole grains and various spice pestos. All these ingredients make for a beautiful, bustling display of color and smells. It's a must if you're in the Jordaan on a Saturday. Location: Noordermarkt (next to the Noorderkerk in the Jordaan)Open: Year-round, Saturdays 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Boerenmarkt on Nieuwmarkt \nMuch like its Jordaan cousin, this city-center farmers' market boasts mostly organic fare in the shadow of De Waag , a stunning, medieval building that once served as Amsterdam's gate house and then a weigh house (it's now a caf√©). This market feels more spacious than the Noordermarkt one, although the areas surrounding the square are quite touristy. Location: Nieuwmarkt (in the Old City Center)Open: Year-round, Saturdays 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Amsterdam's Best Art Markets \nThe absence of galleries or agents at both of these markets keeps prices affordable and offers visitors a chance to interact with the artists. People are often surprised by the high quality of the work in such casual settings. Spui Art Market \nAlso known as \"Art Plein Spui,\" this favorite Amsterdam market in the heart of the city showcases the work of up to 25 professional artists (from a rotating group of 60), whose media include everything from oil, acrylic, watercolor and etching to photography, sculpture, ceramics and jewelry. Location: Spui (between Kalverstraat and Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal)Open: March - December, Sundays 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:08:06.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
