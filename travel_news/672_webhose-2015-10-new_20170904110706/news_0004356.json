A photo posted by Rich McCor (@paperboyo) on Jul 9, 2015 at 2:26pm PDT \nSpeaking to The Daily Mail . McCor said: \"Some of the cut outs are pretty basic so don't take too long but for the tricky ones I'll just put on my headphones and crack on with it. \n'It's incredibly therapeutic, although at times it's equally tedious. \n\"I would love to somehow make this hobby into a career, and if it involves travelling to places to shoot these images then that would be a dream come true.\" \nMcCor's creative journey began when he started taking pictures of his work. He was then approached by Great Little Place London , who challenged him to design 10 photographs for them. \nSince starting the project, McCor has also learned a lot about the history of each landmark, information he also shares on his Instagram account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:16:55.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
