The report aims to reveal the keys to experiencing the “mystical, magical, transcendent” vortex energy for which Sedona is famous. The report was written with a specific focus on visitors to Sedona, Arizona intrigued by Sedona’s powerful energy centers or “vortexes.” Iala Jaggs, Retreat Director at Sedona Vortex Retreats and author of the report, believes that many people who come to Sedona seeking a spiritual experience leave without finding what they came for. According to a Northern Arizona University study, approximately 60% of the 4-6 million people who visit Sedona’s red rock country each year are seeking a spiritual experience. “But unfortunately many leave without it,” says Jaggs. The Report “What It Really Takes to Have a Spiritual Breakthrough in Sedona” can be downloaded at http://www.sedonavortexretreats.com/get-sedona-vortex-retreats-special-report/ When asked about why they released the report at this time, Jaggs said: “I’ve found that people coming to Sedona are not only looking for an epic vacation, but they’re looking for healing, change, deep transformation and connection to Spirit. We like to make sure people get all of these things. So, taking a few minutes to understand the nature of Sedona’s vortex energy and how they can best use it to enhance their own life may mean the difference between a pleasant vacation in Sedona and a profoundly life-changing experience.” Sedona Vortex Retreat’s unique position within its industry gives it the authority to produce such a report on how to have the best possible vortex experience in Sedona because they are one of the few companies in Sedona permitted by the National Forest Service to conduct shamanic ceremonies out on the red rocks directly in the vortex energy. Sedona Vortex Retreats was founded in 2002 and claims that retreat goers who have been on multiple retreats in Sedona often refer to them as “the real deal\"--inner and outer guides who specialize in assisting Sedona visitors in having the kind of deep and powerful experience Sedona is known for. They are best known for their world-class retreat guides, many with over 25 years of experience.
