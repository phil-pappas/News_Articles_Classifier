Mark Mortenson will join GCRC starting today, Monday, October 5, 2015 , to take over the role of CEO.\nBefore accepting the GCRC position, Mortenson spent the last eight years as President and CEO of the Buffalo Society of Natural Sciences, an organization that manages the Buffalo Museum of Science and the Tifft Nature Preserve. A change agent throughout his executive career, Mortenson tripled attendance and membership for the Society while raising more than $7.5 million for capital improvements for the museum and the preserve.\nPrior to that role, Mortenson spent 20 years working his way up the ranks at the Walt Disney Company, finishing as a Vice President of Global Operations Management. During his Disney career, Mortenson managed budgets of over $460 million and supervised hundreds of employees stationed around the world.\nCamille Nighthorse, chairperson of the GCRC, expressed excitement at the prospect of such an experienced CEO taking the helm of GCRC and its properties, which include Grand Canyon West, the Grand Canyon Skywalk, Hualapai River Runners, and the Hualapai Lodge. \"Mark is exactly the new leader we need,\" said Nighthorse. \"He understands Arizona , he understands how to efficiently manage budgets and people, and he understands what makes a great tourism experience for visitors.
