In the season spanning from mid-September this year to mid-May 2016, Zayed Port will host 112 cruise ship calls - up from 94 in the 2014-2015 season. \nThose 112 vessels from across the globe will bring 205,000 passengers. This will represent a fivefold increase in the number of passengers visiting Zayed Port since the first cruise season during 2006-2007. \nThis growth is projected to reach more than 300,000 passengers expected on 130 scheduled ship calls by 2019-2020 season, catalysed by the new world-class cruise terminal at Zayed Port. \nMohamed Juma Al Shamisi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Ports, said: \"These developments describe the significant expansion of Abu Dhabi's cruise industry that further boosts the emirate's tourism development, a major component in its economic diversification. \n\"The upcoming modern cruise terminal at Zayed Port will be a demonstration of our commitment to innovation and stakeholder focus,\" he added. \nThe construction of the new terminal achieved 60 percent completion by the end of August. The building envelope has already been completed and the fit-out of the main passenger hall is 30 percent complete.
