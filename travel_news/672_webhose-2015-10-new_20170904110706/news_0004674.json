Javits Convention Center in New York City next month for HX: The Hotel Experience – Rooms to Restaurants, power-hungry attendees looking for dynamic innovation and a place to charge their mobile devices are encouraged to stop by the Kube Systems Booth #2327. Participating for the first time at this international event, Kube Systems will display an in-room amenity designed to exceed guest expectations, increase satisfaction and boost loyalty. On the market since May 2015, the convenient, compact and future-proof KS Clock™ — a phone charging and music streaming solution — is already installed in 5,000 guestrooms.\nFormerly the International Hotel, Motel + Restaurant Show®, HX: The Hotel Experience: Rooms to Restaurants will run November 8-10, 2015. Celebrating its centennial year, the largest tradeshow in North America will showcase innovative products designed to anticipate guests’ needs and create memorable, unique experiences.\n“Kube Systems is eager to be bringing its exciting new line of guest-charging solutions to HX: The Hotel Experience – Rooms to Restaurants,” said Dave Weinstein, Vice President of Kube Systems. “Focused on innovation, inspiration and information, this event is ideal for us to showcase our inventive guest-facing amenities designed specifically to address the demands of today’s operations, IT, design and procurement “The KS Clock™ isn’t just another in-room alarm clock with a pretty face and a small footprint,” he said. “It’s is an innovative power solution with integrated wired and wireless charging technologies based on the leading Qi global standard for wireless charging. It features an intuitive alarm clock, Bluetooth streaming and the ability to charge up to six mobile devices with an Apple® Lightning, Apple® 30-pin, and Micro-USB flip-out cable, two additional audio-sensing USB ports and optional Qi wireless charging. In addition – and what makes the KS Clock™ one of a kind — is our mobile Room Programmer launched via an Android App and our replaceable and upgradeable modular cables that keep the KS Clock™ from becoming obsolete. Future accessories are in development that will expand the capability of the KS Clock™, such as an optional KS Arm™ featuring a built-in Magsafe charger for Apple Watches. These features – combined with the apparent beauty of the device — are making the KS Clock™ a coveted amenity.”\nThe KS Clock™ is recommended for all smartphones and tablets, including the latest Apple, Android and Blackberry devices. As global charging standards change, the hardware is fully upgradable. In addition, security cables are available to ensure the safety of all Kubes.\nA First for Hospitality\nThe KS Clock™ Android App-based Room Programmer offers a GUI touchscreen experience, making it easy for hotel staff to program. Engineers can program settings for Daylight Savings Time (automatically adjust +1 or -1 hour during the respective DST switch), Display Brightness (day time / night time LED clock face brightness level), Alarm Tone (one of three alarm tone types can be selected), and Audio Volume (sets the maximum audio playback volume/ volume limiter) with just a touch. In addition, a Bluetooth ID can be assigned to each KS Clock™ giving each Kube a unique room number to prevent unauthorized pairing. The Kube also features a Bluetooth (BT) Clear Cache Interval setting that specifies how long a mobile device will remain in memory so the guest does not have to hit the pair button again on KS Clock™ upon re-entering the room after leaving for a time.\n“The KS Room Programmer prevents guests from fiddling with device controls, reducing the workload for hotel staff by eliminating the need for engineers to return to rooms and reset Kubes,” Weinstein said. “All settings are saved and protected via the battery back up in the unit’s internal memory. Guests will only program the alarm if they decide to use it – and the alarm setting is void after one use.\n“The KS Clock™ also eliminates problems with mobile device docking,” he added. “Typically if a guest has a thicker phone case, they need to remove it in order to place the device in the docking station. This can be an irritation to guests, and oftentimes they end up just using their own chargers; the problem is, those chargers often get left behind. Also, if the mobile device manufacturer changes its design or the connector gets replaced, the dock becomes obsolete, costing the hotel owner big bucks to upgrade to next-generation designs. The KS Clock™ is future proof and investment proof. At Kube Systems, we deliver a concierge-like experience to our customers and their guests with no cables to remember and no hardware to replace.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:36:49.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
