The government will also extend its network of Visa Application Centres across China.\nDavid Scowsill, President & CEO, WTTC, said: “I would like to commend the UK government on this great effort. Extending the period of validity of the visas and expanding the UK mobile fingerprinting service from 9 Chinese cities to 50 is an important step by the government to welcome more Chinese travelers to the country.\nTravel & Tourism brings countries economic growth, job creation and social benefit. In 2014, Travel & Tourism generated 10.5% of the UK GDP, or £187.7 billion, and supported 4.2 million jobs, 12.7% of total employment. The announced changes will help the UK to benefit from increased travel from one of the world’s fastest growing tourism markets, and thus boost its economy – specifically the retail and hospitality sectors.”\nScowsill added: “The recently announced changes are a great step in the right direction, however there are still many challenges to overcome to make the visa process even easier. WTTC analysis has shown that extending the length of stay does make a difference but does not have as impactful as a visa waiver programme. The USA has a visa waiver programme with 38 countries. This type of programme is what WTTC ultimately would like to see between the UK and China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:55:20.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
