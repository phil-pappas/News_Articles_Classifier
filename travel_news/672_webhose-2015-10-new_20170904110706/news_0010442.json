Claire Moran, managing director of The Forge Public Relations, says more SMEs realise being tech-savvy can save time and money. “It means they can automate much of the basic work, so when they hire they can take on more flexible and higher-level employees who can help in a number of areas rather than just in clerical or admin,” she explains. 64pc of SMEs plan to invest in technology or equipment in the next 12 months According to a study by Bibby Financial Services, 64pc of SMEs plan to invest in technology or equipment in the next 12 months. The figure was higher for firms with more than 250 employees. Some 67pc plan to invest in technology compared to 63pc for smaller firms. The research also shows 56pc of firms plan to invest in training staff and 52pc will hire new staff. Shaun Thomson, chief executive of Sandler Training (UK), says that as well as increasing effectiveness and efficiency in the workplace, staff who receive training feel more valued – helping reduce the cost of attrition. “Studies show that people rarely move for money; it is because they don’t feel valued. Having their skills developed and nurtured means that the firm can enjoy enhanced employee retention rates,” Mr Thompson says. Other key areas of expenditure for SMEs identified by the survey were new products and services (44pc) and premises (29pc). Less than a fifth (18pc) plan to spend money expanding their export business, while one in 10 firms do not plan to invest in the next 12 months. Being tech-savvy can save companies time and money When it comes to accessing finance for future investment or spending, private equity or venture capital funding was most popular, with 31pc of firms saying this would be their first port of call. Just under a third (27pc) would apply for a bank loan while 21pc of SME owners would invest their own money – clearly their smaller turnovers would make that a more realistic option than for owners of larger businesses. • For more information on funding business growth, visit www.BibbyFS.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:56:03.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
