Through the #BeTheHost initiative, we hope to show UAE Nationals that hospitality is a diverse industry in which you can pursue your personal passion, whatever it may be. As an outsider’s first gateway to the city’s culture, hotels provide a platform to showcase our traditions and serve as ambassadors of national heritage.”\n \nResonating with UAE’s proud tradition of hospitality, the initiative is aligned with the objectives of the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing’s #AnaDubai (‘I am Dubai’) Emiratisation campaign. The aim is to increase the number of UAE Nationals working in tourism by 15 per cent every year until 2020. The initiative also seeks to contribute to the tourism sector in the Dubai Vision 2020 as envisioned by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai.\n \nUAE National colleagues including members of Jumeirah’s Emiratisation programmes, will share their career development stories across the Instagram account. #BeTheHost provides UAE Nationals the opportunity to be mentored by those with a shared cultural background. Another essential element of #BeTheHost will be an exchange of dialogue with UAE students considering careers after university.\n \nDubai’s hospitality industry is expected to be the key driver of the job market ahead of EXPO 2020, given that 70% of the 25 million visitors expected during EXPO 2020 will originate from outside the UAE.\n \nAs a premier partner of EXPO 2020, Jumeirah is at the forefront of hotel development in the UAE offering growth opportunities for personal and professional development.\n \nSource:- Jumeirah", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:25:10.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
