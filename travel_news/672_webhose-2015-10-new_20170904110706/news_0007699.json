Then there’s the cool, briny North Atlantic air, so clean it’s nearly nostril-stinging, and the gentle psychic vertigo induced by being in a place this remote, wild and, aside from the wind and calls of the sea birds, quiet.\nLocated midway between Iceland and Scotland, the Faroe Islands, a cluster of dramatic basalt crags soaring out of the sea, were created some 55 million years ago by volcanic eruptions and are a sort of spectacular Nordic version of Hawaii. Settled by Vikings during the ninth century, the Faroes were probably first visited around A.D. 565 by the Irish abbot monk St. Brendan, who referred to them as ‘‘the islands of the sheep and the paradise of the birds.’’ This description is still accurate, since there are twice as many sheep as people (population 48,300), and the bird life is as rich and varied as any place in the world.\nThe possibility one of these wild birds might end up on your dinner plate says a lot about what’s happening in the Faroes these days. One might assume that life would be drab and austere in a place that may sound almost ghoulishly isolated (like something out of ‘‘Babette’s Feast,’’ the film about the scrupulously pleasure-killing Lutheran religiosity of a remote Danish village in the 19th century) but the Faroes, which are a self-governing country within the Kingdom of Denmark, are instead surprisingly, un-self-consciously, lively — hip, even.\nPhoto Quaint houses in Torshavn, the islands’ capital city. Credit Laerke Posselt Earlier this year, a Faroese restaurant, Koks, in Torshavn, the islands’ largest city, on the main island of Streymoy, won the prestigious 2014 Nordic Prize as the best restaurant in the gastronomically avant-garde Scandinavian countries. Its young chef, Poul Andrias Ziska, serves a seasonal dish of filet of gannet, a wild sea-diving, fish-eating bird that tastes like anchovies but resembles rare beef. Etika, another restaurant in the heart of Torshavn’s Old Town, where the roofs of the houses are covered with shaggy green sod, is regularly ranked as one of the world’s best sushi restaurants (no surprise, since the Faroes catch some of the world’s highest-quality seafood). And Gudrun & Gudrun, a Faroese knitwear label produced on the islands, is carried by the trend-setting Isetan department store in Tokyo.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement Advertisement\n It used to be that most of the island’s creative young people left it, never to return — but no longer. ‘‘Today, most of the young Faroese who go to study in Copenhagen come home afterwards,’’ says Joannes Patursson, a wry, well-traveled and articulate man who is a member of the 17th generation to raise sheep and cattle on his family’s several-hundred-acre ranch in the village of Kirkjubour, which hangs dramatically over the sea’s edge. ‘‘What’s changed is that now you can be part of the big world from a distance. Now we understand that it’s a blessing to live somewhere so beautiful, safe and friendly.’’ Here’s what to see now.\nPhoto Clockwise from top left: the sod-covered roof of the Hotel Foroyar, with its movable dining hut, Skerpi, in the foreground; a room at the hotel; a chef at Koks preparing a plate of filet of gannet, a local bird; lamb is hung and rested at Koks.

Koks, the hotel’s restaurant, is the best table in the islands, with odd but delicious dishes such as cured locally raised lamb on a bed of lichen, and sea urchin with lemon pulp and pickled parsley stems. hotelforoyar.com .\nTUTL\nA seriously excellent music store of the sort you’ll only find on a remote island beyond the reach of Amazon. Its forte is offbeat music from indie Scandinavian and Faroese artists plus traditional Faroese music, which is mostly vocal, and owes much to the oral traditions of Viking storytelling.Particularly recommended for getting any party started is Tyr, a Faroese Viking-metal band — who knew? — that takes its name from the Norse god of law and justice, and which mixes heavy metal with drumming and powerful choruses. tutlrecords.com .\nPhoto Fresh-from-the-sea sashimi at Etika.

Don’t miss the delectably sweet and succulent langoustine and halibut sashimi. etika.fo .\nSTEINPRENT Located in a wing of the old cannery that houses the Ostrom cultural complex, this loftlike lithographic workshop with beamed ceilings and white-painted stone walls hand produces prints by contemporary Faroese and other Nordic artists, including the multimedia artist Toroddur Poulsen, and also hosts regular showings of their work. Their individual styles vary, of course, but many of them call to mind the work of the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch and the Weimar Republic-era German painter and printmaker Otto Dix. steinprent.com .\nPhoto Clockwise from left: the grass-covered roofs of the side-by-side buildings that make up Aarstova, a restaurant that serves modern Faroese food; the braised lamb shoulder at Aarstova; one of the restaurant’s tables.

The cozy, dim, candle-lit dining rooms in this old wooden house (once the home of a pair of brothers who later became locally famous poets) make an evocative setting for modern Faroese food. There are three- and five-course tasting menus, the latter of which consists of smoked salmon, luscious langoustine bisque, two different dishes of locally produced lamb and dessert. aarstova.fo .\nSIRRI\nAll of the knitwear sold by this Torshavn shop is made from Faroese wool, and in addition to clothing for men, women and children, it sells blankets and beautiful fluffy sheepskins so reasonably priced they’re worth filling your luggage with. Many of them are knitted with the traditional Faroese decorative motifs of stars and snowflakes. sirri.fo .\nHVONN\nWeather permitting, this brasserie-bar has a patio that’s ideal for people watching. The rest of the year (the summer season here is brief, from late June to the end of August), a beautiful young crowd throngs the long zinc bar inside the low-lit lounge for a terrific selection of Faroese beers on tap, including the locally brewed Jolabryggj. hvonn.fo .\nPhoto Gudrun Ludvig, the designer of the knitwear line Gudrun & Gudrun, at her shop. Credit Laerke Posselt Advertisement\n Advertisement\n GUDRUN & GUDRUN\nFounded in 2002 by Gudrun Ludvig and Gudrun Rogvadottir, two Faroese women, this line of all-organic, hand-knit clothing (chunky, purled cardigans; open-weave dresses) became internationally known when a costume designer working for the hit Danish television series ‘‘Forbrydelsen’’ (‘‘The Killing’’) came across their modern take on the traditional Faroese fisherman’s sweater and made it the sartorial signature of the show’s driven female police detective. Ludvig, the label’s designer, explains that their original goal was to renew demand for locally produced wool, which had previously been burned because the price had fallen so low that it wasn’t worth washing and processing. ‘‘We were shocked by the idea of destroying the wool,’’ she says, ‘‘and we also wanted to create work for local women.’’ gudrungudrun.com .\nOSTROM\nHoused in a waterfront former cannery, this space has been converted into a cafe and design shop that also exhibits the work of Faroese clothing, jewelry and housewares designers. Of particular note are the fish-skin-wrapped steel flasks and the sheepskin stool covers. facebook.com​/ostromfo .\nPhoto From top: a stone church in the village of Kirkjubour; the living room at the Patursson family's farmhouse-cum-museum in Kirkjubour.

The other interesting sight here is Roykstovan, a 900-year-old log farmhouse with a turf roof, the timber for which came from Norway. The building has been occupied by 17 generations of one Faroese family, the Paturssons, and their farmhouse museum is a fascinating walk through island history, with a huge peat-burning cast-iron stove and decades’ worth of intriguing sepia-toned framed family portraits. patursson.fo .\nFOROYA FORNMINNISSAVN\nThis exceptionally well-designed and -curated national museum offers a fascinating lesson in the history and culture of the Faroe Islands. You’ll find children’s toys made from dried fish bladders, several handmade wooden sloops once used by fishermen and a set of carved medieval pew-ends that represents the 12 apostles. savn.fo .\nPhoto Credit Laerke Posselt", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-PJFK/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-PJFK-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-FQZG/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-FQZG-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-QJA3/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-QJA3-master315.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-MSVI/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-MSVI-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-FQZG/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-FQZG-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-PJFK/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-PJFK-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-SHJ9/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-SHJ9-master315.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/ostromfo", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-7671/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-7671-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-7671/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-7671-blog427.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-881U/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-881U-master1050.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-MSVI/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-MSVI-master315.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-QJA3/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-QJA3-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-SHJ9/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-SHJ9-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/t-magazine/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-881U/22tmag-faroe-t-slide-881U-superJumbo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:03:07.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
