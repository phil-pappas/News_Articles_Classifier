Having only last year become the first carrier to win the award on three consecutive occasions, Titan Airways then surpassed its own benchmark by securing the accolade once again in 2015. \nBACA is the world’s largest and most respected network of air charter professionals - representing the interests of air charter brokers, charter airlines, airports, business aircraft operators, freight forwarders and consultants. Gene Willson, Titan Airways Managing Director accepted the award on behalf of the Stansted-based carrier at the Guildhall in London on Wednesday 14th October at the annual BACA Autumn Luncheon and Excellence Awards. Willson said of the achievement: “We are proud to have been recognised by the industry for our passenger charter services and would like to thank those who voted for us. The four consecutive awards are testimony to the consistent hard work and dedication of our whole team, all of whom share our passion for delivering such high standards of customer service.” The accolade comes at a time of growth for the carrier who recently announced its intention to add an Airbus A319 and an Airbus A321 to its evolving fleet within 12 months.
