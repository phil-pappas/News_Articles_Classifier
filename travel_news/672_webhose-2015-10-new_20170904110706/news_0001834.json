The new wireless solution at The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa in Bath is a combination of a Powerethernet, Ruckus and Cisco Solution, providing a unique wireless offering which has enabled the hotel to have access to super fast internet speeds, rarely found in a Grade 1 listed building. The state-of-the-art solution, which is the first to be installed in Britain, enables the hotel to provide their guests with 21st century amenities in the heart of heritage Bath. \nIT infrastructure specialists MLR Network have installed a Powerethernet T1501 unit in each of the hotel’s 45 rooms and suites to provide The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa with a high speed, state of the art in-room wireless solution. The introduction of the first hybrid Powerline Socket, designed to provide a secure and robust networking solution without the need to run new network cabling into the hotel has ensured that the stunning heritage features of the building remain untouched. It’s not just the rooms that are now high speed, The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa has blanket wireless coverage across the entire property, including The Dower House Restaurant, The Montagu Bar & Champagne Lounge, hotel reception, meeting rooms and even the hotel’s private garden. With Ruckus R500 Access points throughout the hotel grounds, there are no wireless signal ‘black spots,’ ensuring that guests have a seamless wireless experience throughout the hotel, whether it’s to send a vital business e-mail or upload a ‘selfie’ of themselves enjoying a delicious Afternoon Tea. General Manager Jonathan Stapleton comments: “The new wireless solution at The Royal Crescent Hotel & Spa enables the hotel to truly fulfil the needs of a 21st century guest seeking old world heritage combined with new world luxury. For corporate meetings and events, the extensive wireless coverage at the hotel provides them with a fully serviced corporate package.
