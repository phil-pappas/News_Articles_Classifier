R. Rahman, the world-renowned Indian composer becomes Seychelles’ cultural ambassador in India     \nThe world-renowned Indian composer, singer, songwriter, music producer, musician, and philanthropist, Allah-Rakha Rahman, has been named as a cultural ambassador for Seychelles in India. \nThe artist was in Seychelles last week taking part in the second edition of the Seychelles-India Day celebrations. He was called on stage by Minister Alain St.Ange, the Seychelles Minister responsible for Tourism and Culture, who explained that since the last couple of years, Seychelles had initiated the concept of naming cultural ambassadors. \"We choose people who understand Seychelles, who knows Seychelles, and who believes in Seychelles as a holiday destination with a difference and who have the ability to promote us as a sought-after holiday destination to their own people. Today, we are proud to welcome Mr. A. R. Rahman of India as our cultural ambassador,” said Minister St.Ange. Mr. Rahman received his appointment certificate from the country’s Vice President, Danny Faure, in a ceremony organized to celebrate India Fest at the International Conference Centre in Victoria. \nA.R. Rahman was also presented with a token of honor by the chairperson of the Seychelles-India Day celebrations committee, Ramu Pillay. \nPresent at this auspicious occasion were former President of the Seychelles James Mancham, Indian Minister of State responsible for Tourism, Culture and Civil Aviation Dr. Mahesh Sharma, Tourism and Culture Minister Alain St.Ange, and Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Panda, among other guests. \nThe Indian composer, who has made his mark on the international music scene with his song “Jai Ho,” has won a Golden Globe and two Academy Awards. \nA.R. Rahman said he is proud to be chosen as one who will promote Seychelles as a cultural ambassador. \nMr. Sanjay Panda, the Indian High Commissioner, said when he addressed the ceremony that the historical and cultural bonds which exist between Seychelles and India are today stronger than ever. \n“The visit of the Indian Minister responsible for Culture Tourism and Civil Aviation, Dr. Mahesh Sharma, for this occasion is testimony to our traditional cultural linkages that we seek to nurture besides showcasing the various facets of Indian culture in this country,” he said. \nMr. Panda said this year’s Seychelles-India Day celebrations event has been yet another success where everyone has been able to take part in the different activities across the four days. \nDr. Sharma on his part said India is proud of the close bond of friendship it shares with Seychelles that has stood the test of time. He said the cultural linkages date back to many years when the first Indians set foot in the islands as the first inhabitants of Seychelles. \nThe Indian Minister added that 2015 has been a special year in the bilateral calendar. \n“The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Seychelles in March, the first prime ministerial visit from India in 34 years, and the state visit to India by President James Michel shortly thereafter, reflected not only our strategic convergence but also the importance we attach to our bilateral engagement. Our two countries are now on the threshold of a qualitative transformation in our ties across a broad spectrum,” the Indian Minister said. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
