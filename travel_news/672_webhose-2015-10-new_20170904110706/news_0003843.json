Virgin Australia criticised over AFL stunt October 5, 2015 2:35pm Email a friend \nTHEY took to the skies to perform a special stunt for footy fans on Saturday, but it seems the move has backfired for Virgin Australia. \nThe airline organised for one of its aircraft to fly 246km around Melbourne in the shape of the AFL Premiership Cup. The flight path was mapped on Google and, sure enough, it resembled the cup. \nClearly, Virgin was pretty chuffed about the feat, posting this message on its Facebook page: \nYesterday, we created the largest AFL Premiership Cup in history by 'drawing' a 246km outline of the trophy over... Posted by Virgin Australia on Saturday, October 3, 2015 \nSome who witnessed the flyover were thrilled, and the post has attracted more than 7000 likes. \nNicholas Breust wrote: “Such an awesome thing for VA to do! Hope this becomes a fixture each year. Well done Virgin Australia.” \nPaula Strother: “What a brilliant idea loved watching it.” \nBut it wasn’t long before criticism of the post reached sky-high levels, with fans upset over the “extravagant” display in light of expensive ticket prices. \nAdam Burns wrote: “Draw a cup with an A330, but can’t put an extra one on to get fans to a game.” \nJamie Stevens: “I would do that to if I was charging $3000 return to Perth.” \nOthers were shocked at what they deemed an unnecessary waste of resources. \nWilliam Sandwell: “This seems like a waste of time and resources ... Considering no one knew it was happening.” \nDanyal Donmez: “That’s silly.” \nSean Carville: “And the pollution you created? What on Earth? Terrible publicity stunt.” \nFiona Gillett: “First world indulgent waste.” The planned drawing. Source: Supplied \nIn response to the concerns voiced on Facebook, a Virgin Australia spokesperson told news.com.au : “This year as part of our annual Grand Final flyover, we completed something special for footy fans as a one-off activation by plotting out the shape of the Premiership Cup over Melbourne. \n“Virgin Australia has a comprehensive program of initiatives in place to minimise the impact our operations have on the environment. \n“We continually invest to ensure we have a young average aircraft fleet age, which reduces our overall emissions considerably and the emissions of this flight will be offset as part of our Fly Carbon Neutral program.” \nPrior to the stunt, the airline proudly said: “We’ve worked closely with authorities to gain all necessary approvals and the flight will be operated by three of our highly experienced pilots, who are also highly skilled on an Etch-A-Sketch. \n“The ‘drawing’ will take 32 minutes to complete, involve 43 waypoints and cover 246km over Melbourne.” \nVirgin added more than 11,000 seats to help fans travel to matches throughout the 2015 AFL Finals Series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:19:27.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
