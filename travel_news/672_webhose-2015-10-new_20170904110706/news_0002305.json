When I told my family of my plans, they suggested I go to Europe with my friends. It seemed like a logical thing to do. I have a European passport, but I was craving something else. Katie with a beautiful baby Howler Monkey. Image: Supplied The suggestions for where my trip should take me didn't stop until I was on the plane, flying to Mexico. Before I left New Zealand I was introduced to a website called Workaway , it allows you to volunteer in exchange for accommodation and food. It seemed too good to be true. Many overseas volunteering organisations require you to pay a lot of money to help. Volunteering 'uncomfortable yet beautiful' Share your stories, photos and videos. \nWorkaway cost me $35. The best $35 I have ever spent. \nYes, of course, I was a little nervous; a new continent, a new language (that I could not speak but planned on learning) and a completely different culture. However, this website gave me peace of mind and it was perfect for what I wanted to do; experience, help and learn while travelling. \nMy first volunteering experience landed me in Costa Rica. A country that interested me a lot for its nature and biodiversity. \nIn Costa Rica I worked at an Animal Rescue Centre mainly caring for baby Howler Monkeys, and taking horseback riding tours along the most beautiful beach.I was doing what I loved; helping and working closely with animals. I instantly felt fulfilled. \nDuring my free time and on weekends I would explore the country with the other volunteers. We'd hike volcanoes, go surfing or help in the community. I was not only experiencing the local way, I was also meeting like-minded people from all over the world. \nI called this place home for just over 2 months before teaming up with another solo female traveller and making my way down to South America. \nWorkaway gave me the opportunity to experience so many different things. Before I knew it, I was in the remote Bolivian Amazon Jungle, not because I had paid for a tour company, but because I was volunteering. Ad Feedback \nIt was my fourth volunteer experience. Here I was working alongside indigenous locals, helping build and establish a Wildlife and Conservation Centre. The work was hard and our resources were limited. Our main tool even for large jobs was a machete, but that's what made it fun and rewarding. In our spare time we would go exploring through the jungle to find hidden waterfalls, go swimming in the river, eat fresh coconuts off the trees or relax in hammocks and enjoy living with no connection to the outside world.. \nMy most memorable day was playing a game of football against the village children - seeing how they lived in the dense jungle, with next to nothing - but still, they were happy. \nI only stayed there a week but it was an eye-opening experience. I've found when volunteering you don't necessarily need to be experienced, just keen, ready to help and perhaps learn new skills. \nYou can choose your surroundings, your volunteer field and what life you live for a couple of days, weeks or months; that's the beauty of it. I chose extremes; from house-sitting on a peaceful Panama lake, to teaching English in a small rural town in Argentina. I have just finished working alongside gauchos on a remote farm in the South of Brazil. \nIt's not just the volunteering itself that makes this kind of travelwonderful, it's the places it takes you and the people it can introduce you to. \nKatie enjoying meeting some of the local children. Image: Supplied \nI wouldn't have visited so many incredible \"off the tourist road\" places and met the most amazing people if it were not for travelling this way. \nIn-between volunteering, I stayed in hostels; it was great meeting other travellers and experiencing a community. \nHowever I was still looking for something different that would allow me to continue to experience the local way and foster cultural exchange. I discovered another website called Couchsurfing , where you are hosted by locals; either sleeping on a couch or in a spare room (or whatever they are offering). \nI was a little sceptical at first but I have been blown away by the generosity of complete strangers wanting to help and going the extra mile to make my travels that much better. \nWhen you arrive in a place for the first time, it's nice to have some local insight. When I arrived in Uruguay , my host was waiting for me at the bus terminal, to give me the warmest welcome. \nI arrived at the family home to find coffee and cakes and a private room awaiting. They wanted to know everything about New Zealand, they were especially interested in the MƒÅori Culture and even wanted to learn a few words in Te Reo. They were also keen to teach me about their culture, they invited friends around one night and they all taught me how to make their traditional food, the empanada. \nThey also showed me around their city. The son and I shared a similar interest in running so I got my very own running tour around Montevideo. This is only one example of how amazing couchsurfing hosts have been . I know I have made friends for life. \nKatie found 'Couchsurfing' a rewarding experience. Image: Supplied \nI once asked my host, \"Why host?\". \nShe explained \"I can bring different worlds and cultures into my own house without even moving, when you're not in a position to travel there's nothing better\". \nTravelling the world has never been so easy and fun. You need money, but not as much as I had originally anticipated. At times I was even paid for work, given tips, or a car to use to go exploring while volunteering. Sometimes I didn't spend a cent in an entire month, but I still got to see and experience everything. \nIt's definitely safe travelling alone in South America. Many times I walked around looking completely lost, then locals would approach and help me out. As soon as they'd find out I'm from New Zealand, it would turn into helping me with directions or inviting me for dinner. Being a Kiwi has so many advantages; people love our country and our cultureA lot of the times I would request to stay somewhere and they would reply saying \"Because you're a Kiwi YES!!\" \nIf you want to experience culture first-hand, and practice the local language,this type of travel is perfect. It isn't for everyone, but for me, I wouldn't do it any other way. I've had a trip of a lifetime, travelling to 14 different countries and I have learnt so much - including a new language. \nMy dream is to return to the Americas in the future and begin my own project. I'd love to help the thousands of starving dogs on the streets that I met along the way. It's a far off dream right now but I know I'll be back to help in someway soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:27:23.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
