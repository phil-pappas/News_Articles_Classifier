Hotel guests are renting fewer in-room movies because they can watch them on smartphones or laptops instead. \nMarriott hotels ended the practice of offering adult video on demand several years ago. \nThe company's chairman, Bill Marriott, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, said in 2012 that not only was the church \"very, very opposed to pornography,\" but that demand for the movies had \"gone way down\" because \"if they want that stuff, they can get on the computer.\" \nHyatt, a US-based company, owns 618 properties in 51 countries. \nThe National Center on Sexual Exploitation in Washington applauded the change. \"With this step, Hyatt is proving itself to be a leader among corporations that value a positive and safe environment for their consumers,\" the organisation's president, Patrick Trueman, said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:15:46.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
