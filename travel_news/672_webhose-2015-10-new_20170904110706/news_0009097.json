Over the last measured 24-hour period, from yesterday morning to this morning, the average pollution level was 18 micrograms per cubic meter. \"However, it's rapidly increasing. At 6am, we measured 28.68 micrograms per cubic meter; at 7am, 44.02; and by 8am, 70.54. If it continues like this, it will possibly pose a threat to people's health,\" Ms Pornsri said. Last year, Phuket was able to dodge the haze pollution when monsoon winds kept the particles from the island's shores. However, this year, the haze has descended on the island numerous times over the last few months.
