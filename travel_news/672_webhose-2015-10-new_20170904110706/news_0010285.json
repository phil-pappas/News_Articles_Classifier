This ad conveys both the Company’s openness to the world and its pride in offering a unique French travel experience – with elegance, inventiveness and humour. Fashion, fine dining, the Tour de France, the young dancers of the Paris Opéra, and even a French kiss…a series of evocative scenes which reflect the Company’s new attitude, its fighting spirit and its desire to be closer to its customers. \nPOUR VOUS FAIRE PRÉFÉRER L’AVION – TOP/COM D’OR “MEDIA STRATEGY” CATEGORY \nThrough its “Pour vous faire préférer l’avion” campaign, developed by the communication agency Les Gaulois, HOP!
