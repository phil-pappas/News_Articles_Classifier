Here to help we have asked a panel of respected experts to name their favourite funds across various investment sectors. The funds highlighted here are ideas. You may wish to take professional advice before making a decision. Global funds look for shares with the best growth prospects across the world. Some stick to developed markets while others have a large weighting in the fast-growing but more risky emerging market economies. Experts recommend global funds should be a \"core\" holding, making up around 20pc to 30pc of a savers’ Isa. Five-year return of average global fund: 39pc Fundsmith Equity This fund has won an army of admirers since it was made available to savers almost five years ago, holding nearly £4bn in assets. The fund, managed by City veteran Terry Smith, picks a small selection of shares and sticks with them, favouring established firms with big brands such as Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson. Mr Smith manages money in a similar way to Warren Buffett, the legendary investor, buying companies that make money from repeatable, low-value transactions. The fund’s charge is a bit steep, at 0.99pc a year. Other global funds tend to typically cost 0.9pc. But in this case investors should not be put off, due to Mr Smith’s knack of consistently picking the winners. Return since launch (December 2010) 113pc, turning £10,000 into £21,300. (The average global fund is up 40pc over the same period). Baillie Gifford Global Discovery This fund is a top performer, yet is often overlooked by financial advisers and only holds £194m in assets. The fund buys small global businesses that could one day become dominant players in their field. The fund’s top 10 bets include Ocado, the online grocer, and Tesla Motors, the electric car manufacturer. The fund costs 0.78pc. Five-year return 82pc, turning £10,000 into £18,200 Rathbone Global Opportunities For investors who want to avoid the additional risk carried by shares listed in emerging markets, this could be a good bet. It buys only shares listed in the US, Europe and Britain, so you are not getting fully global exposure. But experts said this was not necessarily a bad thing, partly because most of the companies held in the fund generate the majority of their revenues from the emerging market economies. This gives investors exposure to fast-growing regions. Two of the fund's biggest holdings are Visa, the credit and debit card firm, and Facebook, the social networking website. The fund costs 0.79pc. Five-year return 76pc, turning £10,000 into £17,600 Scottish Mortgage This investment trust was set up in 1909 to buy global shares, offering savers a relatively safe home for their cash and more often than not beating inflation each year. More than 100 years later this has not changed. The manager, James Anderson, has around half of its holdings in technology shares, with Facebook and Amazon two of the largest on its books. The fund has an excellent track record of growing capital and has also raised its dividends in each of the past 31 years. In a recent interview with Telegraph Money Mr Anderson said he was backing companies with disruptive technologies to be the big winners in the coming years . Charges are cheap, at 0.5pc a year. Five-year return 106pc, turning £10,000 into £20,060 RIT Capital Partners This investment trust was established to manage some of the wealth of the Rothschild family and is described as one of the safer long-term “buy-and-hold” funds. It owns a spread of assets, ranging from property and gold to shares listed in emerging markets. The fund’s main objective is to preserve capital. After that, it aims to generate “sensible” growth, typically twice the return from cash, by investing in a range of assets including shares, bonds and precious metals. The fund charge, however, is at the expensive end of the scale, at 1.25pc. Five-year return 47pc, turning £10,000 into £14,070 Vanguard LifeStrategy 100pc Equity This fund holds a mixture of “tracker” funds, which aim to mirror the performance of various global stock markets. Around two-thirds of the fund is currently invested in American and British shares. The fund is seen as a great way for novice investors, or those without the time to manage their investments themselves, to put money into stock markets. Charges are low at 0.24pc a year. Three-year returns 37pc (it does not have a longer track record), versus 33pc for the average global fund. • How to become a better investor: Get our weekly email • More fund news and ideas: bookmark telegraph.co.uk/investing The Telegraph Investor £10 to trade shares and no charge to buy & sell funds Open an account »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:52:52.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
