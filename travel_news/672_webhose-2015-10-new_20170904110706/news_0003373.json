If successful these bids will see an additional $97 million injected into the New Zealand economy.\n“It really has been a record year for the sector, with more bids for events than ever before. This year’s focus will be on building on this momentum with higher targets for both conferences and incentive bids.”\nSource:- Tourism New Zealand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:25:01.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
