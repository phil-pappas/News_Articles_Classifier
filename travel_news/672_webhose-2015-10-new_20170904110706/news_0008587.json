Regent Seven Seas Cruises is giving away three special day experiences including chauffeur-driven transfers, a private tour of one of the ships, a special lunch and a coffee or champagne reception. The Luxury Regent Experience day will take place on board one of the cruise line’s sumptuous ships while they are moored in Southampton, allowing guests the full day to take in the elegant ambience of the vessels and the unparalleled facilities they offer. Each lucky winner will be picked up from home with their guest of choice and whisked to the cruise port to be welcomed on board. Three spectacular ships make up Regent Seven Seas Cruises’ offering, including Seven Seas Mariner, which was the first all-suite, all-balcony ship launched and accommodates just 700 guests. Seven Seas Voyager has an even more intimate feel, but still boasts all-balcony staterooms and sumptuous interiors, while Seven Seas Explorer launches next year and is set to be the most luxurious ship ever to take to the waves. The competition prize include chauffeur-driven transfers from any location on the UK mainland within 100 miles of Southampton. The stylish ships lead the way in luxury travel, with sumptuous décor throughout as well as open-air pools, spas and relaxed lounge bars. A grand theatre, driving ranges and putting greens on deck and casino ensure that every guest can find something to interest them. Exceptional dining experiences also await, with speciality restaurants serving everything from the juiciest steaks to exquisite French cuisine.
