They were followed by people in the North West (3.5 holidays) and West Midlands (3.2 holidays) as the nation’s most prolific holidaymakers.\nTable 1.1 – UK regions average numbers of holidays per person\n UK\nAbroad\nTotal\nNational average 1.7 1.5 3.2 South East 1.5 1.3 2.8 London 1.8 2.6 4.4 South West 1.4 1.1 2.5 North East 1.3 1.7 3.0 North West 2.0 1.5 3.5 Yorkshire 1.8 1.3 3.1 West Midlands 2.0 1.1 3.1 East Midlands 1.7 1.3 3.0 East 1.6 0.9 2.5 Scotland 1.8 1.1 2.9 Wales 1.7 1.1 2.8 Northern Ireland 1.0 0.8 1.8\nGeneral optimism looking ahead to 2016\nOn the whole people were more optimistic than pessimistic for 2016, with almost a quarter (23%) saying they intend to spend more money on their holidays than in 2015 and only 15% saying they will spend less money. This optimism was most marked in the East Midlands and Wales, where over a quarter (28% East Midlands; 26% Wales) intend to spend more. However, some intend to spend less than in 2015, with a quarter (25%) of those in Northern Ireland and just under a quarter (23%) in the East saying they will tighten their belts.\nLondoners taking by far the most holidays\nApart from taking more holidays than any other region, Londoners were also far more likely to take four or more holidays abroad than any other region, one in five (20%) of people living in London did so the last year, compared to the national average of less than one in ten (9%).\nWelsh most likely to take a package\nPackage holidays were most popular in Wales with six in ten (60%) of Welsh people booking an overseas package holiday compared to the national average of just under a half of people (47%). Packages were also more popular than average in Yorkshire (55%) and Scotland (54%). Those in the South West were the least likely to book a package, with just over a third (36%) booking an overseas package.\nMost and least popular booking methods around the country for overseas holidays\nOnline travel agents were most popular in Wales with four in ten (40%) booking at least one overseas holiday this way and least popular in Northern Ireland with just 15% of people booking an overseas holiday this way. Booking direct with a tour operator was most common in the West Midlands, with almost a third (29%) booking a holiday this way, and least popular in the North East (12%).\nBooking via a high street travel agent was particularly popular in the North and central regions with a third (32%) of those in the North East and a third of those in the East Midlands (31%) booking at least one foreign holiday this way compared to the national average of 17%.\nThe Scots spend the most on longer holidays overseas\nPeople in Scotland were the most likely to spend more than £500 whilst on a longer holiday overseas, with four in ten (44%) stating that they spend this compared to the national average of 34%. People in Yorkshire are the least likely to splash the cash, with 26% saying they spent over £500 whilst on an overseas holiday.\nMark Tanzer, ABTA Chief Executive commented: “Consumer confidence is gradually returning to the market and the general picture from holidaymakers is that they are more likely to be spending more on their holidays next year than they did in 2015. However, there are very clear regional differences with Londoners taking considerably more holidays than people in some other regions. On the whole most of us are averaging three breaks a year, either in the UK or overseas, making an incredible contribution to the health of the UK economy as well as to people’s well-being.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:44:11.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
