Depending on the El Niño forecast for this winter, Northern California offers it's nicest weather in late October right into December. Why not visit when the kids are back in school and the crowds have vanished? You'll find it easy to get into restaurants, campgrounds and motels offering seasonal rates. Here are four of our favorites, far from the maddening crowds: California Coast, Bodega Bay north to Mendocino: This piece of California (just three hours from Stockton) offers impressive vistas, spectacular food, great camping options and wonderful places to stop for the night. Our first destination usually is Bodega Bay (the town is different than nearby Bodega, home to the old school where the 1963 Hitchcock classic 'The Birds' was filmed). Bodega Bay offers a variety of waterfront restaurants and motels, and several nearby beautiful campgrounds. Stop at the Tides Restaurant for a delicious breakfast or lunch, and check out the myriad state parks for tenting or trailering options. Wright's Beach State Park, between Bodega Bay and Jenner, is right on the ocean. Cross the languid Russian River northbound on Highway 1 to the town of Jenner, where the Russian River spills into the Pacific. Stop at River's End Restaurant for great food and stunning views. Also, below their deck above the river, harbor seals usually are visible sunning themselves on a sandy spit near the river's end. A few miles north of Jenner on Highway 1 is Fort Ross Historic State Park, the old Russian outpost from the early 1800s. Then come a host of quaint coastal towns such as Sea Ranch (stop at the Sea Ranch Lodge for breakfast or lunch), Gualala (Bones Roadhouse a fine lunch choice for BBQ or fish dishes, and Gualala County Regional Park just south of town, very pretty, secluded campsites) and Point Arena (visit Point Arena Lighthouse for stunning coastal views). Further north, Manchester, Elk, Albion and Mendocino beckon. Mendocino is the quintessential California coastal town, with trendy shops and several restaurants — don't miss Mendocino Headwaters State Park, just west of town for superb ocean views of rocky bluffs. Pinnacles National Park: Rising from the Gabilan Mountains south of Hollister are the spectacular remains of an ancient volcano — a volcano located 160 miles south, near Los Angeles! Pinnacles National Park is on the San Andreas Fault and is moving a few inches north each year, distancing itself from its mother volcano. A landscape of rugged spines, deep canyons, eerie talus caves, verdant foliage and rushing streams hosts robust wildlife — from deer, wild turkeys, bobcats and feral hogs, to the majestic California condor with wingspans up to 7 feet. Stay overnight in Hollister or camp in Pinnacles Campground, the park's only campground, with a store, visitor center, swimming pool (in season) and showers. Also, a shuttle bus runs regularly between the park's two main trailheads, about three miles away. Hiking brings out the best in Pinnacles, so bring comfortable walking shoes and water. From the Bear Gulch Trailhead, a moderately strenuous 1-mile hike passes the spooky Bear Gulch Cave (bring headlamps or flashlights) and Bear Gulch Reservoir, then return on the Rim Trail for a change of scenery. Or, venture further into the High Peaks area for treks to Balconies Cave and views of Machete Ridge and the Balconies Cliffs. Just south is the historic town of Jolon, Ft. Hunter Liggett (an active military base) and the historic Mission San Antonio. Continue west on occasionally tight roads (not advised for trailers) and find Big Sur and a wild California coast. Pinnacles Park: nps.gov/pinn or (831) 389.4486. Camping: recreation.gov or (877) 444.6777. Oakland's Jack London Square and San Francisco's Embarcadero: To beat the high cost and crowds of a Bay Area visit, start in the Jack London Square waterfront area of Oakland and take the ferry across to the Ferry Building on the Embarcadero in San Francisco. Take your bikes and upon arrival you can bike (or walk) miles along the waterfront in either direction. Stop to explore the massive Ferry Building, recently renovated and full of restaurants, bakeries and shops. If you want to spend an overnight, motels in Berkeley and Oakland are far less expensive than those in San Francisco. Gold Rush foothills tour: Coloma, where the California Gold Rush began, is the place to start a tour of the lovely foothill towns along Highway 49. Capt. John Sutter of Sacramento hired members of a Mormon battalion in the 1840s to develop saw mills to supply lumber to his growing empire. One was James Marshall, who chose Coloma, on the banks of the south fork of the American River, to cut timber and mill lumber. When Marshall found flakes of gold in the saw mill’s tailrace (the ditch that drained water away from the waterwheel), the discovery ignited the largest mass movement of people to California. Mormons built cabins, Chinese opened shops and several are preserved at the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park in Coloma. A walking tour gives kids and adults a first-hand lesson in gold mining, from panning for gold to the \"California Stamp.\" Miners quickly discovered this crude \"stamp\" could crush ore into powder, which could be mined for gold and silver. Kids and adults can try panning for gold and enjoy “Living History Days” held on a regular basis. Take the time to walk through Coloma’s history, picnic under riparian oak trees and reflect on Marshall’s discovery 167 years ago. Nearby is the historic town of Placerville, just eight miles south on Highway 49. Exploring further south are Mother Lode walkable towns such as Fiddletown (seven miles off Highway 49, from Plymouth), Amador City, Sutter Creek, Columbia and Sonora. Most of these communities offer a host of motel, hotel and bed and breakfast accommodations as well as restaurants, delicatessens, bakeries and grocery stores.
