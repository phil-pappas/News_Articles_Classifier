This is in addition to code share on American Airline’s daily non-stop services between Sydney and Los Angeles beginning 19th December 2015, operated by the carrier’s flagship B777-300ER aircraft.\nAs part of the expanded relationship with American Airlines, Qantas will also offer coordinated schedules with the airline that allows for seamless travel within the United States and Australia. Last week, the carriers launched a new marketing campaign to showcase the customer benefits of this expanded relationship. For a limited time, Qantas Frequent Flyers can earn double Qantas Points on eligible flights with a Qantas (QF) flight number between Australia and the USA or Canada.**\nSource:-Qantas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:33:53.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
