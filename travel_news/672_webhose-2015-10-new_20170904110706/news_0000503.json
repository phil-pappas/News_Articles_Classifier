Introduction Offering free wireless Internet, fresh barista-made coffee and a fair buffet selection throughout the day, Brisbane Airport's Qantas Club domestic lounge is the go-to facility for travellers stuck in economy: whether they're Gold-grade frequent flyers or indeed paid-up Qantas Club members.\nWith very welcome renovation works flagged for 2016-17, Australian Business Traveller stopped by to see what jetsetters can expect in the Sunshine State until the spruce-up is complete.\nAccess Qantas Gold, Platinum and Platinum One frequent flyers before Qantas, QantasLink, Emirates, Jetstar or Oneworld flights Qantas Club members before Qantas, QantasLink and Jetstar flights Oneworld Sapphire and Oneworld Emerald members when their next onward flight that day is with Qantas or QantasLink and carries a QF or other Oneworld flight number (no access when flying Jetstar) Emirates Skywards Gold and Platinum cardholders where their next onward flight that day carries a QF or EK flight number and is operated by Qantas, QantasLink or Emirates Passengers flying onwards in Qantas or QantasLink business class Travellers connecting to or from an international business or first class flight with Qantas, Emirates or a Oneworld airline, even if booked in economy on the domestic leg\nQantas Platinum and Platinum One frequent flyers, Oneworld Emerald members and business class passengers may also use the adjacent Qantas business class lounge.\nDining Our mid-afternoon visit saw a reasonable spread with ingredients for salads and sandwiches, along with a sandwich press and cheese slices...\n... a fresh and mixed salad...\n... sliced bread, rolls and apples:\nBarista-made espresso coffee is available throughout the day – joined by liquorice allsorts and lemon crisps – although your cuppa is unfortunately served in disposable cardboard cups rather than mugs and glassware.\nThe coffee queue can be long in the mornings, so there are also self-serve machines scattered throughout the space with real coffee cups...\n... along with a self-serve soft drink dispenser at the bar, and again, self-serve wine from noon.\nTrumping the beverage list in Virgin Australia's lounges, the Qantas Club also boasts spirits in addition to six beer and cider varieties on tap.\nAltogether, we assembled a respectable afternoon snack of cheese and accompaniments...\n... and of course, paired that with a glass of white wine.\nWork Brisbane's Qantas Club has a well-designed and central business nook with banks of Apple iMac computers running Windows in addition to OS X...\n... and a 'Chargebar': handy to top-up your phone's battery if it's running low, although with no way to secure your phone while it's attached you'll want to remain close by.\nMeeting rooms are available for hire in the same area, while groups of seats nearby are a great place for more informal conversations among colleagues.\nTowards to the lounge entrance, a long bench suits travellers toting their own tech...\n... with AC power points, although not USB slots, tucked away underneath:\nAn ASX board keeps travellers up-to-date with the stock market...\n... while free wireless Internet for lounge guests provides the gateway to everything else.\nUpload speeds were more than sufficient at 6.8mbps, even on a busy Sunday afternoon, although at the same time downloads hovered around the 0.66mbps mark: that's when the connection is noticeably slow and when I'll whip out my backup hotspot.\nRelax As you'll find in Brisbane's international lounge for Qantas Club members, its domestic counterpart has several TV suites with viewer-controlled Foxtel programming...\n... a wall devoted to reading material with both magazines and newspapers...\n... and comfy seats in which to enjoy the company of others...\n...or simply a well-earned glass of wine after a productive day.\nAlso read: New Qantas lounges coming to Brisbane Airport\nFollow Australian Business Traveller on Twitter: we're @AusBT\nAbout Chris Chamberlin Chris lives by the motto that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, a great latte, an opera ticket and a glass of wine!\nFollow @ausbt on Email: [email protected]\nTwitter: @MusoJournoChris\nGoogle+: Chris Chamberlin Share this Review have something to say?

If they cant sort something out on the spot they will get you to enter the lounge and come and find you once its all sorted 4 report reply 2 7 hours, 54 minutes ago by reeves35 As Motef points out, the lounge is often uncomfortably crowded. It is definitely showing its age and the lack of natural light is a big problem with much of the lounge often quite dark. (The photo you have used in the DIning section appears to be the SYD lounge!!)\nThe staff are very pleasant but as pointed out the layout is hard for them.\nThe promise of a newer bigger lounge is promising and needed. As it currently stands, the BNE QF lounge is a generation or 2 behind the new VA lounge at the other end of the terminal.\n-1 report reply 1 7 hours, 49 minutes ago by Chris Just double-checked and that photo is indeed from Brisbane – we haven't photographed or reviewed the Sydney Qantas Club, although the design at the buffet is indeed very similar to that of Sydney and also Melbourne.\n2 report reply 1 7 hours, 10 minutes ago by motef I also did a doube take on that photo of the female having a coffee\nIt must be from the Business Lounge or if it is indeed the Club then it may be right down the rear (roadside) corner in what is the quite (no phones) area.\n-5 report reply 1 6 hours, 45 minutes ago by Chris Ah, apologies, I thought you were referring to a different photo. The featured image ('woman with coffee cup') is a generic lounge photo supplied by Qantas, and could well have been taken in Sydney.\n1 report reply 3 4 hours, 43 minutes ago by LondonAussie Chris,\nUnder access, you should add that AAdvantage Admirals Club members get access when their next onward flight is on a QF ticket.\nGot myself a 30 day membership recently for a week long trip back to Aus, and despite crediting everything to QFF, was never denied access to TSV, SYD, SYD INTL, BNE lounges.\n0 report reply 1 4 hours, 31 minutes ago by TheRealBabushka Thanks for the update LondonAussie!\nSeems the old rules are still in place, despite changes to the verbiage on the AA website.\n2 report reply 1 2 hours, 44 minutes ago by LondonAussie TRB, I should have put an update on my Q&A Thread.\nI only had a little trouble at TSV where the Qantas Lady at the front initially said no (unless my AA # went on ticket), but then when she checked with her Sup, found it was fine.\nFor most other cases, they simply re-printed my Boarding Pass and wrote my AA number on it and kept it to charge AA. At BNE, they had a sheet at the front that was filled in.\nInterestingly, the Agents at both SYD Dom and Intl knew what I was up to and commented on how brilliant the 30 day pass was. So, me thinks I am not the first to spot this loop hole and exploit it!\n2 report reply 1 2 hours, 26 minutes ago by TheRealBabushka Fantastic!\nSpread the word folks.
