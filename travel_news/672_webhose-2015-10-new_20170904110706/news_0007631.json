No organization knows that better than AIANTA,” said Senator Schatz. “This award is a real honor. I want to thank AIANTA for this award and for the work they do every day to advocate for Native communities and support tribes and Native-owned businesses in Hawai‘i and across the country.” \nEarlier this year, Senator Schatz, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the Senate Tourism Caucus, introduced S.1579, the Native American Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience Act or the NATIVE Act, to enhance and integrate Native American tourism, empower Native American communities, and expand heritage and cultural tourism opportunities in the United States. The bill has garnered broad bipartisan and bicameral support. The legislation was recently voted to be favorably reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. \n“Tourism is an essential part of Hawai‘i’s economy, and it is so important that Native Hawaiians are included and supported in this arena,” said Pohai Ryan, Executive Director of the Native Hawaiian Hospitality Association and former Hawai‘i State Senator. “Thanks to Senator Schatz’ leadership in writing and introducing the NATIVE Act, this bill will help to advance tourism’s potential to improve the lives of Native Hawaiians, while also supporting and expanding Indian Country tourism throughout the country.” \nAIANTA is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit association of Native American tribes and tribal businesses, organized in 1999, to advance Indian Country tourism. The association is made up of member tribes from six regions: Eastern, Plains, Midwest, Southwest, Pacific and Alaska. The purpose of AIANTA is to serve as the voice and resource for its constituents in advancing tourism, assist tribes in creating infrastructure and capacity, provide technical assistance, training, and educational resources to tribes, tribal organizations and tribal members. \nEach year, AIANTA recognizes the best of the Indian Country travel and tourism and honors individuals with Enough Good People Awards for their work to support tribal tourism and its mission. This is the first time AIANTA has chosen to honor a Member of Congress for their public service to help grow and sustain American tourism that empowers native communities and honors their traditions and values.
