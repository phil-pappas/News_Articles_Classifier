In 1978, UNESCO recognized the park's \"global significance for biodiversity conservation\" and made it the world's first natural World Heritage Site.\nNow, once endangered populations are starting to thrive.\n'Bleeding heart' monkeys\nNicknamed \"bleeding heart\" monkeys due to the red hairless strip these primates have on their chest, these rare baboons (officially geladas) can only be found in Ethiopia, with many residing in the Simien Mountains. Somewhat plentiful in the 1970s, the IUCN Red List puts their number today at around 200,000.\nRead More One particularly unique aspect of the geladas is that they live in caves high up in the mountains where few predators can reach.\n\"It's a good habitat because it's free of enemies, (who) can't climb the rocks because the rocks are slippery. The only animals climbing here are the geladas,\" notes Maru Biadglegn, the chief warden of Simien National Park.\nTo see geladas in their natural habitat, watch the video below:\nJUST WATCHED Ethiopia's 'bleeding heart' baboons Replay More Videos ...

In order to help grow the population of these animals, and other species that live in the area, the Ethiopian government has invested $7.5m to help resettle people away from protected habitats. As a result, the park has tripled from its original size to 256 square miles and wildlife populations are growing, according to Biadglegn.\n\"Twenty years ago, it was difficult to find walia ibex,\" he says.\n\"The number was only 150. Now there is the protection and expansion of their habitat, we have more than 900 individuals.\"\nEthiopian wolf\nThe park is also home to one of Africa's most endangered carnivores: the elusive Ethiopian wolf.\nTo find the animal, one would have to climb Ethiopia's highest peak -- Ras Dashen mountain stands at 14,700 feet tall.\n\"This area is known as Kechomo Buhayit. It is a home to the Ethiopian Wolf,\" says Abraham Assefa, a scout at the park.\n\"Nearly 25 are estimated to live in this area. And their number is increasing.\"\nBecause so few abound, spotting these rare beasts is difficult, but hopefully in the future, it will be easier to catch a glimpse for visiting tourists.\nJUST WATCHED Catching a glimpse of the Ethiopian wolf Replay More Videos ...

In remote parts of the country like the Simien Mountains, tourism can be a lifeline.\nAccording to Biadglegn there are now around 6,000 people working in the local tourism industry.\n\"There are also 69 local guide associations, 70 cooking associations, also 10 car rental associations,\" he says.\n\"These are our partners in order to conserve the natural resources and in order to satisfy and get information for tourists.\"\nUp among Ethiopia's highest mountain peaks, local communities have helped wildlife populations recover -- and now wildlife is improving the lives of the people in return.\nRead more: 5 reasons to visit the 'Perfume Isles'\nRead more: Is Ethiopia the site of the Ark of the Covenant?", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019113125-spc-inside-africa-ethiopia-a-00002330-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://traffic.outbrain.com/network/trackpxl?advid=814&action=view", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019115911-ethiopian-wolf-exlarge-169.png", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019113125-spc-inside-africa-ethiopia-a-00002330-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019115911-ethiopian-wolf-medium-plus-169.png", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019115911-ethiopian-wolf-small-11.png", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019113125-spc-inside-africa-ethiopia-a-00002330-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019113125-spc-inside-africa-ethiopia-a-00002330-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019115911-ethiopian-wolf-small-169.png", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019115911-ethiopian-wolf-full-169.png", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019113125-spc-inside-africa-ethiopia-a-00002330-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019113125-spc-inside-africa-ethiopia-a-00002330-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019113125-spc-inside-africa-ethiopia-a-00002330-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019115911-ethiopian-wolf-super-169.png", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151019115911-ethiopian-wolf-large-169.png"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:20:36.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
