Airport development continues to play an important role in our strategic plans, creating thousands of new jobs and providing an engine of economic growth vital to the growth of Dubai.”\n“The show will provide an invaluable opportunity to view the latest global technologies and best practices and create new opportunities for our industry to collaborate,” he added.\nThe iconic B2B show will occupy an exhibition space of 15000 square metres at the Dubai International Convention and Exhibition Centre (DICEC), with larger participation expected by country pavilions from Germany, France, UK, Italy, Switzerland, USA and China. With an expected growth of over 15 per cent, the organizers are confident about the show being a complete sell-out once again.\nDaniyal Qureshi, Group Exhibition Director at Reed Exhibitions Middle East, organizers of Airport Show and co-located events, said: “The Middle East has displayed an unprecedented appetite for aviation growth and regional authorities are putting in place the airport developments necessary to handle the huge surge expected in passenger numbers over the next decade.”\nHe added: “Combined with massive capacity upgrades regionally in Africa and South Asia, Dubai is ideally positioned to host the world’s leading airport expansion and development event once again. The Airport Show offers a critical link connecting global airport suppliers with the regional buyers and showcases the best the industry has to offer.”\nGlobal interest in the Middle East aviation has remained strong given the excellent growth record.\nAccording to the World Airport Traffic Report of Airports Council International (ACI-World), the Middle East reported the highest growth rates in the world -10.8 per cent in passenger traffic in 2014 compared with the global average of 5.7 per cent, and 9.2 per cent growth in cargo traffic as against 4.7 per cent global average.\nIn Dubai, the planned $32 billion expansion of Al Maktoum International in the recently rebranded Dubai South (earlier known as Dubai World Central) will help accommodate that rapid growth with an ultimate capacity to handle up to 240 million passengers upon completion, remarked Sheikh Ahmed.\nA whopping $441 billion has been invested in airport projects globally in the first half of 2015, according to the mid-year review by Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA). It said there are currently 340 new airport projects globally. By end of July, CAPA said it is aware of 2,520 airport construction projects worldwide, a figure that is slightly higher than the one reported in January 2015 (just over 2300). It suggested that there were about 100 airport projects in the Middle East by end-July, with nearly half of them being new airports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:40:06.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
