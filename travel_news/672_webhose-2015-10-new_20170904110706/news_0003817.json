Expected outcomes are more convenient daily life inclusive socio-economic growth reducing corruption and increasing transparent governance. \nTypical of the 'Linkster' generation Raj Kumar accesses news and information online that his friends share. 'I cannot imagine life without a mobile phone' he grinned. \nLikewise with ‘Linksters’ from more economically privileged backgrounds such as Yatin Angara (17) and his buddy Kran Somaya (18) in two well-known colleges in South Mumbai. 'My family gets four newspapers daily but I never read them' said Somaya. 'I get news from my cell phone. It first gets here and then in the newspaper tomorrow.' \n'My mobile phone is my newspaper' smiled Angara a commerce student who knew of Digital India from Facebook. 'Digital India can help us become as technologically advanced a country like Japan' he said. \nAnd so 'M-Governance' or mobile governance holds potential in the Indian governmental view 'to make development a truly inclusive and comprehensive mass movement. It puts governance within everyone’s reach'. \n'Digital India' with its tagline 'power to empower' becomes a technology transformation of a country in a scale never before attempted in history. \nInevitably like any big harbinger of change Digital India suffers from skepticism about effectiveness. Or suspicions of security of publicly stored personal information such as in the new Digital Lockers. \nConcerns include safety of bio-metric technology and the 256-bit secure socket layer (SSL) encryption used in Digital Lockers. But as in earlier decades when some folks continued hoarding life savings at home rather than trust banks misgivings accompany prospects of digitally storing sharing personal documents such as birth certificates and income tax records. \nDigital Locker despite concerns already has 981000 users in three months since being launched in July 1 2015. The Ministry of Communications and IT says Maharashtra (of which Mumbai is capital) Uttar Pradesh West Bengal Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh states lead in Digital Locker users. \nMuch of negative noises over Digital India may be misplaced a difference in outlook such as seeing the glass half full or half empty. Few question the necessity to build roads and 'building I-ways are as important as highways' as India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at the Digital India Event in San Jose California on September 27. \nWith increased connectivity through the National Optical Fibre Network India aims to bring broadband to 6 villages schools and colleges across the country. \nUnnoticed travelers in these I-ways include lower-income sections such as street vendor Raj Kumar and office attendant Dharmapal Jagtap (52). He his wife and four children each has a mobile phone and Internet access through a home computer. Smart phone ownership was up by 63% across India in 2014. \nIncreasing cell phone-dependent lifestyle is proliferation of multi-billion dollar m-commerce companies like Flipkart Amazon India Snapdeal and Paytm. \nPervasiveness of mobile phones already seems eerie when consciously looking for it. On a quietSundayevening at Marine Drive by the Arabian Sea nearly one out of three people I saw were engrossed in their palm-held gadgets as a phone camera or fingers busily scrolling LCD screens. \nA family of threefather mother and maybe 5-year old daughterwere sitting on the promenade ramparts with their backs to the sea each holding a smart phone and lost to the world. \nLess than a kilometer away a homeless couple outside the Life Insurance Corporation of India headquarters was watching a movie on a mobile phone. \nMandi Trades a Digital India App for farmers In districts of Maharashtra farmers use a Whatsapp group to share agricultural information. 'Mandi Trades App' in a Digital India portal is a location-based 'Farm to Shop' trading platform for agricultural products. It also gives updated daily agricultural commodity prices. \n'Digital India is an exciting proposition for the country' said Ram Bhatt a Chennai-based entrepreneur. 'People need something to believe in and rally behind and it has brought a lot of energy enthusiasm and interest in India.' \nAnd it has opened an Ali Baba's Cave of information and sharing of ideas. For instance the primary Digital India 'MyGov.in' portal and 'App' is like a national online 'town hall'. Over 1.30 million members have submitted 136000 ideas on 216 projects and 6.5 million comments in 332 discussion themes according to the National Informatics Centre that manages Digital India web sites. \nConspicuously missing though are specifics on how this feedback is processed and used. And since the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) avoids direct interaction with the media questions grow of how deep is this 'transparency' the government talks about. \nPart of this avowed 'transparency' is much needed as in rescuing people from corrupt governmental clerks. For instance online tracking of files is key part of the e-governance upgrade. \n'Data.gov.in' includes inputs from 17833 resources 98 governmental departments and 107 Chief Data officers (*1) to enable direct access of administrative information. \nAnd so Digital India can potentially slash India's infamous red tape. 'It can help to break free from the bureaucratic stranglehold' said Arun Toshniwal (72) an industrialist owning Chemito Technologies a pioneering electronics manufacturer from Mumbai. 'Misdeeds can be quickly exposed. I think Digital India can make a major difference to the country and is already changing business management methods.' \nRajiv Gandhi (19441991) could take early credit for this evolving digital journey. In 1984 as India's youngest Prime Minister at age 40 he visualized a computerized India in days when the country was ranked 'Third World'. People laughed at him. \nNow as the world's fastest growing economy India needs Digital India for fast tracking development cutting across socio-economic divides. Skeptics can remember that technology benefits largely depend on the user. Rome was not built in a day and Digital India use will increase across decades. \nEven at school level technology use is expanding in unprecedented extent. During my school days in Don Bosco Egmore in Chennai our three science labs were probably same as when the school was established in 1958. Not a single computer existed the year I passed out of school in 1985. \nRaj Dharmaraj senior technology consultant helping to bring advanced interactive learning to schoolchildren Three decades later in 2015 Don Bosco Egmore has an experiential 'Science Centre' that is first of its kind in South Asia. Built in collaboration with Canada's Ontario Science Centre the four-floor DB Science Centre includes a robotics laboratory. \nAlumni Raj Dharmaraj Human Resources chief of the New Jersey-based Cognizant Technology Solutions had helped in this project seeing potential of advanced interactive technology in school education. The 'DB Science Centre' includes a mobile lab to bring science to children in villages. \nSuch interactive e-learning in schools receives strong focus in Digital India that held a nationwide quiz for schoolchildren. In 1985 we had a black board for teachers to drive Pythagoras theorems and Faraday's laws into our distracted heads. \nIn 2015 Don Bosco Egmore has video conferencing each classroom a LCD projector and a digital smartboard for visual-based education. Digital India plans to convert text books to e-books in an increasingly paperless life. \nAcross decades Digital India has evolved to be an umbrella program the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) co-ordinates. It revolves around 'Nine Pillars' to transform India: \n1.Broadband Highways– urban and rural to connect 250000 villages by December 2016. \nIncreasing Mobile Connectivity– as in 55619 villages yet to have mobile phone services.Public Internet Access– as through Google providing free high-speed Wi-Fi in 500 railway stations.Electronics manufacturingwith aim of 'zero imports' of electronics by 2020. Boosting manufacturing of electronics like set top boxes mobiles medical electronics smart cards micro-ATMs.E-governanceto simplify government processes cut red tape by reducing application forms reduce corruption by online filing tracking files.IT for jobs– training young people for Information Technology jobs such as training around 10 million students from small towns villages and from north-eastern states by 2020.Information for All– digital democracy through portals like Mygov.in and the comprehensive Open Government Data platformdata.gov.inEarly Harvest Programsprojects to be implemented in short time frame such as a national portal for lost and found children Wi-Fi in universities school text books to be converted to e-books SMS-based weather information and disaster alerts.eKrantia core pillar of Digital India that offers electronic delivery of governmental services from 44 departments such as education health security agriculture law courts road transport taxes etc. The Department of Electronics says eKranti averaged 32 million monthly transactions from January to April 30 2015 dealing with land records health education passport police courts municipalities taxes. India is on its way on new digital highways in a dawning era of technology-driven democracies. \nNotes \n1) Digital India'sOpen Government Data a joint India-USA initiative is an open source platform for countries worldwide to use.
