The trucking industry is the lifeblood of the United States economy. Trucking is a $700 billion industry that moves between two-thirds and three-fourths of the nation's freight. NTF is committed to assisting truck drivers across the nation. NTF offers a no credit check program, including a 48 state IRP plate 2290 Federal Highway Use Tax. This saves a trucker upward of $4,000 a year by using this program! Included is a 5 year protection plan, nationwide. NTF touts that this can save a trucker thousands of dollars a year with a call to their emergency breakdown team. Included with this plan, the trucker's payment is taken care of while the truck is being worked on in a shop.\nNational Truck Funding is quickly approaching 5,000 truckers! NTF has also just agreed to purchase a vast group of 2012 Kenworth T-700 long-haul trucks from Peterbilt of Atlanta . Bill Davies just delivered twenty of these trucks to National Truck Funding.\nAs these trucks travel down the highway, the motors actually clean the air! The EPA regulates emissions of air pollution from mobile and stationary sources under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The new exhaust after-treatment system helps combat air pollution problems. This is an exciting new environmental technology that should be in line with Congress' new EPA pollution bills! National Truck Funding will be opening two more locations at the beginning of 2016. This will expand NTF to five locations across the United States .\nNational Truck Funding is in the process of expanding with new locations dealing with National franchise dealerships with Peterbilt, Kenworth, Volvo, and, Freightliner. National Truck Funding believes truck drivers are the backbone of the American economy.\nFor more information please visit Americantruckshowrooms.com .\nThis press release was issued through 24-7PressRelease.com.
