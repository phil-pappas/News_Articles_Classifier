The finale event took place on Saturday, 10 October 2015 at NUS Enterprise@Blk71.\nBased on the theme of ‘Your Travel, Your Way’, participants from 30 teams were provided two real-world business challenges related to the aviation industry and were tasked with developing digital applications suited for the modern traveller. Details of the business challenges can be found at Annex A.\nTeam EnthuSIAst impressed the judges with their prototype, which enhances the end-to-end inflight experience between passengers and cabin crew, and emerged victorious as the winner of the Challenge. The first and second runners-up were Team Invulnerable and Team Lambda. Teams were evaluated based on the following criteria: innovation, business value, technical competency and user experience.\nFor the best use of our partners’ development platform and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Team Proz won the Best IBM Bluemix Award. Team EnthuSIAst received the MasterCard Pay & Fly Challenge prize, while Team Yoda received the Best Usage of Skyscanner API prize. More information on the prototypes by the top three teams and the list of schools which participated can be found at Annex B. High resolution images of the Challenge are available upon request.\nThe top team won a trip to Silicon Valley in the US, the global capital of technology and innovation, where they will meet with executives from companies such as Google and IBM. The second and third place teams won 50,000 and 30,000 KrisFlyer miles, respectively. The winning team and selected participants may also be offered an internship stint with SIA.\nRegistration commenced on 4 August 2015 and received overwhelming responses from various tertiary institutions. The competition began with a Kick-Off session on 3 October where the business challenges and tools such as development platforms and APIs from leading aviation and technology partners were shared with close to 180 participants.\nPartners and sponsors of the event included Amadeus, IBM, MasterCard, NUS Enterprise, SITA, Skyscanner, Tata Consultancy Services and Tibco Mashery. Participants received guidance from these renowned industry partners and Google, as well as Singapore Airlines representatives, as they developed their application prototypes over the period of a week.\n“All the participants have much to be proud of as they displayed a great sense of creativity and determination when developing their applications. Although they were only given a short period of time to work on their prototypes, they rose to the challenge and were able to marry technology with their newfound knowledge of the aviation industry to the best of their abilities. Singapore Airlines and our partners would like to congratulate all who participated in the Challenge on a job well done,” said Singapore Airlines Senior Vice President Information Technology, Mr George Wang.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:06:27.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
