When historic homes go up for sale, decades of vintage treasures come up for grabs. This month when a Tudor Revival-style four-story mansion known as The Knoll hit the auction block in Meridian , Miss., suburb Poplar Springs, the items for sale included French, Italian and English period antiques like porcelains, leather bound books, oil paintings and a Ribbon Oak Jacobean dining room table about 400 years old.\nAs estate sales recirculate these historic collectables into new hands on the weekends, Meridian's best-known shops for antiques restock their shelves. Want in on the hunt for something special? Head into town on a Friday night and stick to the following schedule for a perfect Saturday of antiquing:\n7:30am – Start with the Estates\nBefore you get some shuteye at a hotel on Friday, peruse EstateSales.net to find out which homes will open their doors to shoppers Saturday morning. A favorite in the Meridian antique scene, estate sale organizer Ben Box says expect just about everything to be for sale—from under the kitchen sink to in the attic to in the driveway—and don't judge a home by its exterior. \"You don't necessarily have to attend big size homes to get what you're looking for because things are passed down through families and generations. People that have been in the same neighborhood for 70 or 80 years, often they have three or four generations of items in their home.\"\nWhat To Snag Early: It's a blast to pick up 1960s dresses, vintage Christmas decorations and board games, but Box says besides jewelry, his favorite item is sterling silver flatware. \"You get the advantage of it being older, which sometimes means the weight is heavier and the work is better. And the price is much better than retail.\"\n11am - Patti Melts and Fried Pickles\nFor a taste of third generation family cooking famed among the locals, stop for lunch at New's Restaurant , which began as a café in the back of a Shell service station in 1942. Founder Herman New opened the business six months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and his wife cooked hamburgers for the customers waiting to have their cars serviced. As burgers sold for 10 cents each, county and city school buses began stopping by on their way to football games, racking up orders of 80 to 100 burgers a night. Today it is still a popular spot for fried dill pickles, cheeseburgers, egg sandwiches, patti melts, or a grilled country ham and cheese.\n5020 Poplar Springs Dr, Meridian, 601-483-9051\n12:15pm - Storage-Turned-Shopping\nNamed the Best Place to Find Great Antiques by Mississippi Magazine in 2014, the Atrium Mini Mall is located inside a New Orleans style brick building that was once home to a family furniture store. Today it operates as a climate controlled storage facility that encourages tenants to open their doors during business hours and peddle their wares. You'll find jewelry, baby clothes and modern day monogramming. For owner Wayne Wuestefeld, the best part is seeing the furniture sold on site at his father's business from 1962-1982 recycle through for resale. \"It speaks to the quality and the idea that better furniture is really everlasting,\" he says.\nOwner's Favorite Find: \"We had an ivory tusk statue that came through here for $10 that was later valued at $400-$500 and was well over 100 years old. Before they put an embargo on doing that sort of thing.\"\n5009 Highway 493, Meridian, 601-482-1414\n1:45pm- Always Looking\nOld windows. Staircase spindles. Four-panel and five-panel solid wooden doors. These are the types of architectural finds that make Rebecca Herbert's heart sing. The co-owner of Antique Mall of Meridian, she also has a thing for men's razors, shaving mugs and brushes, old machinery parts, wheels and other pieces that hint at trades nearly lost in the pages of time. And she's been known to help her customers track down exactly what they have in mind. \"I'm always looking,\" Herbert says. \"I had a man from Arkansas whose wife was a teacher, and he wanted an old box that she could use on her desk to put pencils in. So when I was in Nashville [at the fairgrounds flea market], I was looking for that sort of thing.\"\nWhat Not To Miss: Herbert's husband makes all the candles and old fashioned lye soaps for sale on site, with nearly 40 fragrances in his collection.\n1411 Roebuck Drive, Meridian, 601-483-4683\n3:30pm– Go Junkin'\n45 Flea Market & Antiques just northeast of Meridian in Marion is a huge indoor retail space crammed with fun finds. A message on their Facebook page says it all: It isn't really hoarding if your stuff is cool. Booth items include 1990s Star Wars action figures; glassware; old wooden dressers painted folk-style; ceramic jugs; farm equipment; and rows of clean, empty baby food jars for crafters. Akin to a yard sale you could stay at for days, you'll find true antiques next to shabby chic and repurposed scraps that will make you smile.\nIf You're a Collector: This is the stop for repurposed furniture as well as NASCAR coins, baseball cards, knives, tools, steins, cast iron skillets and wooden ammunition boxes.\n7890 Hwy 45 N, Meridian, 601-679-7777\n6pm – Cross Country Cuisine\nHead to Harvest Grill for food that is so delicately and colorfully plated it's almost hard to eat. Owner and head chef Marshall Gilmore is so consumed with the presentation of his dishes that he made the décor indoors monochromatic so it's the food that shines. Focused on simple recipes with a modern flare, Gilmore calls his specialty cross-country cuisine—reflecting the teaching he picked up in kitchens from Hawaii to Colorado to his Mississippi home. The Crab Cake Sliders are pan seared and served over arugula and remoulade. The Watermelon Carpaccio Salad offers shaved watermelon and radish over mixed greens, strawberries, feta and balsamic vinaigrette. And for fall, Gilmore is firing up an in-house smoker for wings and bratwurst and ribs. Every Saturday during football season, domestic beers are $2 all day.\n618 22 nd Avenue, Meridian, 601-282-5069\nBefore heading back home, Box says take time for one last thought about estate sale items you nearly purchased, because most dealers will list remaining items half price on the second day. And if you happen to visit on a weekend without an estate sale on the books, there are plenty of other galleries, malls and gift shops to fill your schedule.
