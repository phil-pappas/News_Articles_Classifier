The proposed agreement will bring together the airline’s more than 8,600 technicians and related employees under a single contract.\nUnited and the union worked with the assistance of the National Mediation Board to reach the agreement.\n“Investing in our people is key to United’s long-term success, so I’m encouraged that we have reached this agreement with such an important part of our workforce,” said United acting Chief Executive Officer Brett Hart. “Our customers care most about taking off and landing on time, and doing so safely, and the unsurpassed efforts of our professional technicians and related employees help make this possible every day. We appreciate the efforts of the negotiating committee as well as the assistance of the National Mediation Board in helping us reach this agreement.”\nUnited has joint collective bargaining agreements covering the majority of its represented employees, including pilots, dispatchers, fleet service, passenger service, reservations and storekeeper workgroups. The company is engaged in mediated negotiations with the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) and recently entered into discussions with its pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, to consider an extension of their current collective agreement.\nThe proposed agreement is subject to ratification and covers mechanics and related employees located throughout the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:31:58.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
