I tell him I am on my way to the ancient village of Zhuge which I have read is a rare survival from the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). I have the name written down in Chinese characters and hope to find a taxi to take me there. But my new friend won’t hear of it. “Far too expensive,” he says. “It is better to take the bus.” I explain that my Chinese is non-existent. “Not a problem. It would be my privilege to help you.” And so I find myself on the local bus to Lanxi which is packed out by farmers and shoppers. Lanxi may still have a small-town dot on the map but it has grown into a high-rise city with three bus stations. I’ve arrived at the wrong one for a connecting bus to Zhuge. This light-bulb moment is achieved using the Lonely Planet phrase book and advanced sign language. I spot a taxi across the road and show my crumpled sheet of paper. The driver nods and gestures for me to get in. We cruise slowly around the square as he hails other drivers. Look at this big-nosed blonde foreigner in the back of my cab, he must be saying. His friends nod and grin. And so do I. It has become easier to travel independently in China Zhuge isn’t found in any guidebook. I came across it while browsing the internet as I made a plan to tour Shanghai’s hinterland. China’s most beautiful traditional towns and villages – those not trashed by war, revolution and the rush to modernity – have become tourist playgrounds. Hung with strings of gaudy red lanterns, they are full of “antique” shops and “homestay” guesthouses, usually run by outsiders on behalf of the government. Zhuge is far more authentic, though it does charge Y100 (£10.50) to help pay for the upkeep. I walk down a cobbled street back into the past. Wooden shophouses surround a large pond where locals slurp up noodles outside rustic tea-houses. There are signposts in English to heritage houses. The place is a maze of alleys leading to ornate stone-carved doorways of Ming and Qing era mansions, temples and ancestral halls. The community was once very wealthy, producing famous imperial administrators and woodcarvers. • Lost in translation: hilarious mistranslated Chinese signs “We are still a close community; all 4,000 of us share the surname of Zhuge,” says my 21-year-old guide Ting. I met her by chance at her father’s restaurant. She had just returned from a year in Florida after being nominated by her college in Hangzhou for a placement in Disney World’s China pavilion. Ask the concierge to write down the places you want to visit in Chinese characters as the Chinese are not skilled map readers As we wander through the Prime Minister’s Temple with its outstanding wooden sculptures of the Eight Immortals curled around the brackets that support the crossbeams, I ask how such treasures could have survived the Cultural Revolution. “Our elders covered all the most important works in clay plaster,” says Ting. “So when the Red Guards came, the halls looked quite plain. It is our heritage, part of who we are; we had to save it.” I had thought that the old ways had been discarded in today’s China, but Confucian ethics still hold sway in Zhuge. “When I was about eight, all the children were taken to the Great Law Court [another staggeringly impressive wooden hall] and told how we should behave in our community and of our duty to our elders.” I hear similar stories as I journey north through Anhui province where salt and tea merchants built beautiful wooden mansions in what are now designated World Heritage villages. In Xidi and Hongcun, the setting for the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, families still live in their cavernous ancestral piles though they have to put up with megaphone-wielding guides bringing tour groups through all day long. In a quiet moment, one old man says that he removed the intricately carved 300-year-old screens – used as room dividers in Chinese houses – and boarded them up below the stairs during the Cultural Revolution. As the light falls and the day-trippers leave, the locals reclaim the streets: farmers sort corn and roast camellia leaves for the famous Huizhou green tea; shopkeepers gossip over plates of air-dried ham. I stay in an old house, converted into en suite rooms, which has a lovely view over the traditional clay-tiled roofs to the hills beyond. The room costs £15 through booking.com and the owner speaks English (as confirmed by online reviews). Special tourist buses run from Hongcun to the Yellow Mountains (Huangshan), a granite massif immortalised by Chinese landscape painters – and rightly so for it is a place of staggering beauty. There are cable cars for those who can’t face the three-hour uphill slog to reach its craggy stone crown where vast canyons plunge sheer for a thousand feet into great forests of bamboo. It is easy to fall into conversation with fellow travellers. On the climb, I meet Buddhist nuns from Hong Kong, students from Nanjing and an American teaching English in Beijing. Even on a Tuesday it is busy, but this is nothing compared to weekends when the trails are more crowded than Oxford Street at Christmas. Superfast trains and the Google Translate app have both helped Western travellers Travelling alone without a guide turns up so many questions that I book a day’s cultural immersion with Shanghai and Beyond – another internet-browsing discovery – to get some answers. The days are run by Tracy Lesh, an American who has lived in China for a decade, and her Chinese partner Michael Wang. I choose to visit Wang’s home town of Nanxun on China’s ancient Grand Canal where he arranges a private tour of a 19th-century silk merchant’s house, a calligraphy class (I soon see why writing was used as a meditation exercise) and a visit to a collector of scholars’ rocks, prized as sculptural centrepieces in Chinese gardens. As Tracy, Michael and I tuck into local delicacies at a canal-side restaurant, we discuss how much easier it has become to travel independently in China thanks to online booking, superfast trains and the Google Translate app, a version of which the locals are taking up to help communicate with foreigners. All it takes is a little courage and a talent for playing Charades. • China holidays: how to chill out Download the Google Translate app to your phone or iPad Top tips for a safe trip Pick up a hotel name card from reception to show taxi drivers. Ask the concierge to write down the places you want to visit in Chinese characters as the Chinese are not skilled map readers. Learn a few words of Mandarin. Survival Chinese (Tuttle Publishing, £4.99 through Amazon) has a useful pronunciation guide for the Romanised pinyin words. Download the Google Translate app to your phone or iPad. Keep pen and paper handy to write down prices. A commonly used sign for 10 is to make a cross with index fingers. Tour mountain areas and heritage towns midweek to avoid the throngs of Chinese weekenders. Visit major museums over lunch when most tour groups head off to restaurants. Beware of “students” who befriend you in popular tourist spots and suggest a cup of tea. It will prove a very expensive cuppa with heavies suddenly appearing to ensure you pay. Never lose your temper or show up a local’s lack of ability or knowledge in public. The shame of “losing face” will lead to inaction. Take care crossing the road. Always look both ways – even on one‑way streets and in pedestrianised zones – as silent electric mopeds which are allowed to roam at will cause accidents.
