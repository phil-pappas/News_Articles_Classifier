I'd recommend the Deni Ute Muster in New South Wales. \nIt's Australia's biggest rural festival. This year 18,000 campers, 5988 utes, 5000 camper trailers, tents and mobile homes turned up for the two-day event. \nWe attended the 17th annual Muster earlier this month during a return road trip from Sydney to Deniliquin.

Acres of vehicles were lined up in rows that went on for as far as the eye could see. Hundreds of barbecues and drum fires were scattered between all types of shelters for their overnight stays. We were fortunate to have a rent-a-tent complete with stretcher, a soft pillow and light – palatial – compared to sleeping on the back of a ute I thought. \nThere were several camping options the first being the ute paddock. No caravans or trailers are permitted there. It was soon obvious that this area was, party central. Come twilight it was all go, music, and bonfires, and younger ones dancing on the back of their utes (some even had dancing poles) were having a ball. \nAlso close to this area was the non-ute paddock, where you could tent, caravan or sleep in your car. JOHN BISSET/FAIRFAX NZ \nAerial view of the Deni Ute Muster at Deniliquin New South Wales. \nIf you are a bit older like myself and needed a bit of sleep, then the family camping area was the place to be with noise restrictions were in place. It was a great area to be especially if you had children. \nWhen we arrived at the rally site on Friday afternoon at 4pm, it was still 34 degrees Celsius. I couldn't believe some of our Aussie neighbours were still wearing jeans. \nOur tent was supplied and set up, so we explored the rally site. Talk about huge – we seemed to walk forever but never managed to get around all the isles of utes and campers. \nA helicopter flight over the festival grounds the next day showed the enormity of the event. I had to ask the pilot to keep flying away from the site so I could get the whole area in my viewfinder. Ad Feedback \nWe awoke on Saturday to typical Aussie weather, a cloudless blue sky and 30C plus. There was no shortage of entertainment during the day. \nUte barrel racing was popular, with large crowds lining the banks. Two utes race around 44 gal drums in the dust laden arena, with the winner moving on to the next race, at times all you could see were clouds of dust. \nMost of those entrants also competed in the Circle Work Championship where drivers showcased their skills of drifting, donuts and the execution of figure eights. \nRodeo bull riding also drew a huge crowd who watched as cowboys were sent flying through the air and eating red Aussie dirt. \nOther events during the day included, motoX stunt riding, whip cracking competitions and even a dunny building competition. The Holden Grunt Off had teams of men and woman dragging a Holden ute 40 metre, competing for the fastest time. \nThe blue singlet, world record attempt was at high noon. Entrants collected an official count sticker before congregating near the main stage. \nExactly 3959 people turned out wearing their blue singlets in a sweltering 34C to set another world record by 35C. \nWater tankers provided much needed drinking water during the heat of the day, with one spraying jets of water into the air to the delight of many of the overheated crowd. \nGraham Brown from The Oaks in NSW is $10,000 better off after winning Ute of the Year with his 1982 Toyota Landcruiser. Brown spent more than $100,000 and 12 years completing the project. \nLots of showers and portaloos were scattered around the venue; however, there were often long queues to get into one. \nCold Chisel, Lee Kernaghan, Birds of Tokyo, The Wolf Brothers, Adam Brand and the Sunny Cowgirls were just some of the bands that had the crowd rocking into the early hours of the morning. \nMusic echoed across the campsite at night, providing a real party atmosphere. When things got quiet, there was no shortage of ute owners redlining their engines and piercing the night air with a screaming V8. \nIt was certainly an eye-opening experience and something worth seeing. I'm definitely keen to go again. \nJohn Bisset travelled as a guest of Destination New South Wales . - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:09:00.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
