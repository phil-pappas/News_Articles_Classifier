Classical musician 'threatened with arrest and patted down... The yacht that's powered by the sun: On board the world's... Three in four British travellers 'now actively avoiding'... Himalayan Experience’s expedition is open to 12 people, who will be accompanied by four guides and Sherpas, although it is only open to climbers with at least two previous 8,000 metre (26,246ft) summits, including Everest.\nSeattle-based Madison Mountaineering is the other company offered guided expeditions, with its $58,500 (£38,500) trip expected to last as long as 60 days.\nBut the cost for both trips will be higher, as the packages do not include expenses such as return airfare to Pakistan, extra hotel nights, and bonuses for Sherpas.\nWhile those companies reserve their spaces for veteran climbers, there is a risk that others who follow in their footsteps may not.\nK2 is a much tougher climb than Mount Everest (pictured) because the terrain and weather is much worse\nMick Conefrey, an Oxford-based author and documentary filmmaker who has written a book on the first climbers to reach K2’s summit, doesn’t think commercialised tours will bring the same large-scale climbing that Everest has because the mountain is so difficult to conquer.\nIf anything, it will raise the profile of the mountain, which will remain a badge of honour, he said.\nHe told MailOnline Travel: ‘It will be more of a niche, but people will still see it as a huge challenge.\n‘It will become more accessible, but I don’t think you’ll have novices ever saying “I’m going to climb K2”.’\nMr Conefrey is the author of The Ghosts of K2, which documents early attempts to climb the remote mountain and the saga of the first successful ascent.\nIn 1954, Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli accomplished what many tried to do before them when they reached the peak.\nMr Conefrey has visited K2 to film a documentary, but has not attempted to reach its summit.\nAuthor and documentary filmmaker Mick Conefrey has written a book on the first climbers to reach K2's peak\nHe said the mountain is considered the toughest in the world because its steeper terrain is varied, with some spots covered in avalanche-prone snow and others in ice and rock.\nThe weather tends to be much worse than Everest, it is a much more technical climb and it’s very hard to find campsites on the way up, he added.\nIn some years, no one has reached the summit.\nMr Conefrey said: ‘Because of all those factors for years there wasn’t really the same kind of commercial expeditions that you get on Everest.\n‘There were no companies offering packages to climbers where they would have a high level of support, with a lot of Sherpa and guide assistance.\n‘The sort of commercial operators who work on Everest regularly just weren’t in the K2 game because it was thought there wouldn’t be the demand because it’s so much harder than Everest.\n‘[Guided expeditions] are something nobody really expected because K2 was seen as being in a different league.’", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LfJlkt"], "published": "2015-10-06T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:19:19.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
