The Company’s current portfolio spans across 28 states and reaches from the Mid Atlantic to the Southwest and multiple dynamic markets in between. \n“The focus has been on building relationships with new ownership groups and not just the addition of assets to the portfolio,” Kolessar continues. “We strive to partner with owners who want to realize the highest potential of their hospitality assets, and we do so by collaborating not just on day to day management but on future acquisitions, investments, and when the time is right, exit strategies that make sense.” \nThe 177-room Shoreham Hotel located in Midtown New York City marks the first venture with this ownership group. As manager, GF is developing strategies for this independent, boutique hotel to compete in the most competitive market in the country. Using its past New York experiences, combined with the Company’s targeted approach to sales and marketing, great things are expected of this partnership. \nAnother first time partnership is marked at the 101-room SpringHill Suites, Las Cruces, NM. GF’s west coast team has been avidly preparing for this assignment. There have been significant business shifts in this market and GF is tasked with ensuring the continued success of this high performing Marriott asset. \nWhile GF has been managing 208-room Lodge at Gainesville in Gainesville, FL since 2014, when the property traded and settled into hands of new ownership, GF was retained as manager, due to the extraordinary strides the hotel has made since GF was initially installed. The new ownership group and GF have a shared vision for the future of the hotel, and GF’s highly talented Southeast operations team will take this vision and make it into an operational success. \nGF was also retained as manager for the 122-room Hilton Garden Inn New Orleans Airport, located in Kenner, LA, when the sale occurred earlier this year. GF had already been managing the hotel since 2011 and had taken the property out of a distressed state, through an extensive renovation and into a consistent and highly performing operation. Once new ownership was in control and retained GF, the same ownership then entrusted two additional hotel assets into GF’s portfolio. \nWith its hands on approach to operations and a proactive approach to sales and marketing, coupled with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Company and the dedication of the field teams across the country, GF is looking forward to achieving the utmost success at each hotel. \nAbout GF Management \nWith more than 80 hospitality assets under management, including hotels, resorts, conference centers, catering facilities, casinos and golf courses in 28 states, GF Management specializes in third-party management, asset management and advisory services for a variety of individual, private, institutional and financial clients. The Company is currently seeking to expand its portfolio of full-service ownership and management assignments through long-term contracts and joint-venture investment opportunities.
