He uses a cricket analogy to sum up his strategy as portfolio manager at Old Mutual Global Investors. “We are not trying to hit the boundary. Instead we are looking for small increments – like single runs. Over 10, 15 or even 20 years this accumulation of small returns, when compounded, can build a decent, consistent return.” A high-risk, high-return strategy may deliver a great innings year on year, he says, but there are 10 more pronounced ups and downs. For families who aim to build and keep wealth, save for school fees or university, and who want steady upward growth rather than wild swings, consistency is important. “We are not looking to run a fund which is up 70pc one year and down 40pc the next. You might expect that sort of fund to be attractive but in the long run it is actually a fund with long-term, steady consistency of performance that wins out.” For families who aim to build and keep wealth, consistency is important The secret of consistent returns is twofold – compound returns and diversification. Compounding means that gains and interest are rolled up, so that the underlying assets grow steadily and gradually. Diversification helps to spread risk across different sectors, asset classes, and geographical regions. This has been helpful when world markets have been uncertain and volatile. The turmoil started by currency devaluations and falls in the Chinese stock market have spread panic around the world and it has been an advantage to have a defensive portfolio. For investors who are looking for income – perhaps because they have retired, need to pay for school fees or tuition fees, or need to help their children buy their first home – this consistency of return is particularly important. We're not looking to run a fund which is up 70pc one year and down 40pc the next Taking large or regular sums of money from a portfolio after a big market fall would have a disproportionately negative effect on their overall wealth in the long run. The OM Managed Fund has a large cash holding and has diversified across asset classes and geographical areas. “We invest in fixed income products around the world and we have interest-rate exposure around the world. The source of our returns are as diversified as we can make them.” He says that the fund has “no home country bias” but believes the best opportunities in the UK are with mid-cap companies rather than large FTSE 100 stocks such as BP or Shell, which are affected by global issues.
