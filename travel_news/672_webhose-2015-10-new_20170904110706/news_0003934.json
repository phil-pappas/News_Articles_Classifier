Photographer's Note \nA glimpse of just a few of the one hundred boats that visited Leros yesterday having set out from Turkey. They started arriving at midday and kept entering the harbour the whole afternoon. The operation of mooring so many boats of all types and sizes in such a small harbour was incredibly smooth and neat and Ayia Marina was soon full of visitors, walking along the coast and taking photos. They are staying today too, they participate in an original type of regatta and are having a ceremony in Ayia Marina this evening. It is their second visit to Leros but first to Ayia Marina. I'll include a general view in the WORKSHOP. Thank you for visiting", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:29:27.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
