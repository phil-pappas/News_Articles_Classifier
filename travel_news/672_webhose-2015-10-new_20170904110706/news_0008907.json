Do Dubai without a sheik's budget: Forget seven-star hotels... More than just Santa's helpers: Meet the nomadic Mongolian... No Instagram... but they still had a good time! Vintage... The road to Yllas is known as being one of the most beautiful in Finland.\nOur coach weaved its way through valleys filled with fir trees, and as the sun came up briefly – there’s just four hours of daylight at this time of year – the white snow sparkled against a bright blue sky.\nThe Snow Princess Hotel is not sophisticated but it is a pleasant and comfortable base, with masses of good food and an excellent bar.\nThe first snow falls here in November and continues until May. During our stay, the temperature fell from around minus 10C to minus 20C (Cranberry called this ‘mild’).\nThat first evening there was a school canteen feel to the dining hall, which was heaving with children.\nWitness the incredible landscape in Lapland, with vast snowy expanses and winding roads through fir-lined forests\nChildren can explore the vast ice hotel, which is constructed from 20,000 tons of snow and 350 tons of ice each year\nYou may be reluctant to start thinking about Christmas, but a trip to the snowy wonderland is a present for the whole family\nI was thrilled to find mounds of salads and fish, and Lara was equally pleased to note that chips are the most international food of all.\nAfter supper, as we sat in the bar, a man dashed in through the front door and cried: ‘They’re here!’\nWe rose as one, and headed outside to see the sky flickering with the eerie bright green of the Northern Lights.\nTo my delight, the lights appeared every night, each experience as unforgettable as the last.\nOne evening we visited the Snow Village to enjoy the beauty of the Ice Hotel. The village is built every year from about 20,000 tons of snow and 350 tons of ice.\nThere are rooms and suites where you can spend the night wrapped up in furs.\nOn the last day we went sledging, decorated gingerbread, sat in a sleigh pulled by a real reindeer and, of course, met Santa.\nAs we waited our turn, Lara was jumping up and down with excitement. And when we entered the room, she was rendered speechless.\nYou may be reluctant to start thinking about Christmas, but this is a present for the whole family.\nThe snowy scenery, sleigh bells and jolly camaraderie is enough to melt the iciest of Grinch-like hearts.\nTRAVEL FACTS Thomson ( thomson.co.uk , 0871 230 2555) offers four nights on a full-board basis at the Snow Princess Hotel in Lapland from £819 per adult and £665 per child, including return flights from Gatwick on December 2 and transfers.\nHolidays are also available from Manchester, with prices from £616pp.\nA visit to the Snow Village costs from £68.67 per child and £99.65 per adult (including a meal).\nSnowmobile adventures start at £62.99 per child and £92.99 per adult, while husky trips cost from £72.99 per child and £112.50 per adult.\nRead more: Thomson | Holidays designed for you.
