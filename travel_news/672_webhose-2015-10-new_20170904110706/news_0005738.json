The electorate must face the realization that it is always easier to destroy than to build and the candidate must not be tempted to see the spot on an opponent's face when there are many blemishes on his own. \nAccording to Sir James the Seychellois people must count their blessings in living in such a beautiful country but beauty is not everything if we are living in an atmosphere of hatred, dislike and hostility. \nWe should listen to the words of God and endeavor to spread love where there is hatred and unity and harmony where there is discord and anger. \nTaking into account what has recently been said at political meetings and what has been written in different partisan newspapers it would appear, according to Sir James that many have lost their ability to discuss important issues calmly and respectfully regardless of their party affiliations or other differences. \nWe are a small country and although our economy looks good at this time, we must appreciate the need for stability if we are to consolidate on recent achievements. This will require that we all come together in an atmosphere of harmony to solve our problems\", Mr Mancham stated. \nI believe \"that the Republic of Seychelles should aim to be One Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" \nIn this respect I am appealing to all fellow seychelles citizen to show decency and common sense over the next few weeks and thereafter.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:17:25.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
