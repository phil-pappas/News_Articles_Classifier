Led by Ms Erena Chan, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, hotel representatives from ten Dusit properties throughout Thailand and other regions including the Philippines and the Maldives hosted the roadshow, with two days of sales calls culminating in a tabletop event at the famed Roosevelt Club in Shanghai. \nOver 70 business partners from the travel trade, FIT and MICE sectors attended the event where there was also a presentation on the company's latest flagship property to launch this year, the Dusit Thani Guam Resort. Situated on the island's pristine Tumon Bay, the resort features panoramic views from its 419 well-appointed rooms, suites and villas. It is the island's only luxury hotel and the newest build in over 15 years. Guests were invited to participate in a lucky draw for the grand prize of a 2-night stay at the new resort, inclusive of round trip tickets courtesy of United Airlines. \"China is an extremely important market for Dusit, being the number one source market for a number of our properties, especially across Thailand and the Maldives,\" commented Ms Chan. \"These roadshows give us the opportunity to meet with our clients face-to-face, to thank them for their support and provide new opportunities to drive business. Our hotels are all China-ready, with staff, cuisine and amenities in place to cater to their needs while offering our unique brand of Gracious Thai Hospitality.\" Dedicated to serving its Chinese guests and clients in China, Dusit has Regional Sales Offices in Shanghai and Beijing, in addition to a Chinese Centre at the group's headquarters in Bangkok. In 2013, Dusit entered into a joint venture agreement with local partners to form Dusit Fudu Hotels & Resorts, a hotel management company created to bring the four Dusit International hotel brands to China.
