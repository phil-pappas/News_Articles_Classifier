Members will now be able to share points among more friends and family, book stays with a mix of cash and points more conveniently, book travel in advance before having enough points, and earn Elite night credits for stays paid for with points. Marriott Rewards is focused on giving members greater flexibility through a less complicated and more seamless program, allowing them to fuel their passion for travel even faster at the 16 brands participating in the Rewards programs, including Marriott Hotels, JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts, Renaissance Hotels, Autograph Collection and Courtyard by Marriott.\n“Giving our members greater freedom in their reward travel is part of our mission,” said Thom Kozik, vice president, Loyalty, Marriott International. “The Fab Four is just one example of how we are continually adding more simplicity and flexibility to the Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards programs, giving our 53 million members even more value for their loyalty.”\nPoints Sharing\nWith Points Sharing, which launches today, members can now transfer and receive points into and out of their accounts among all family and friends who are also Marriott Rewards or The Ritz-Carlton Rewards members. Whether it is traveling for family reunions or to watch their favorite sports team play, members are increasingly traveling in groups.\nCash + Points\nMembers will now have more flexibility in booking redemption travel with a mix of Marriott Rewards or The Ritz-Carlton Rewards points and cash. This means members can take advantage of the points they have earned faster than ever before. The improved Cash + Points benefit launches in early 2016 for stays as brief as one night. Members will be able to choose the combination that makes most sense for them.\nPoints Advance\nMembers can now book redemption travel even if they do not have enough points to cover their travelat the time of the booking. With Points Advance, members can continue to earn points needed for their upcoming redemption travel or take advantage of Points Sharing or Cash + Points.\nRedemption Stay Credit\nMembers of Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards will be able to earn Elite night credits for redemption stays paid for with points at all participating hotels beginning November 1, 2015. This will make it easier for members to achieve or maintain Elite status by having their accounts automatically credited for redemption stays. This benefit reflects Marriott Rewards and Ritz-Carlton Rewards belief that members should be rewarded for each and every night they choose to stay at a participating hotel.\nModern travelers are loyal to brands that understand their lifestyle. In a complicated world, they seek simplicity and flexibility; a desire to explore the world in search of fulfilling new experiences; and an opportunity to create more meaningful connections with friends and family, while also making new and lasting connections among communities worldwide. Marriott Rewards commits itself to evolving with its members so they can enjoy the benefits of loyalty on their terms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:51:30.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
