Here are a few tips you want to know about before you plan your tour. Not all of the Las Vegas tours lift off from the city itself, some of them take off from a neighboring city such as Henderson, Boulder City, or North Las Vegas. Those departure points are okay, but you can save some commute time by booking a flight that departs from the Strip in Vegas. Lights Of Vegas One fun reason to book a helicopter tour that departs from the Strip is that you get to see Neon Boulevard and all it's colorful lights on your return flight from the canyon. The pilot gives you a bird's eye view of the Strip and notable landmarks like the Luxor Pyramid and the Stratosphere Tower. Not only that you'll see the Manhattan skyline of the New York-New York, the Bellagio fountains, the Paris Eiffel Tower, and the MGM Emerald City. Plus, this tour offers transportation to and from your Vegas hotel by limousine. If you'll be in Vegas for an anniversary, birthday, or honeymoon celebration, this tour will make it more special. The flights that depart from the Strip in Vegas utilize state-of-the-art EcoStar 130 sightseeing choppers too. The EcoStar 130 offers the best flight experience when you tour the Grand Canyon. The cabin is about 25 percent bigger than a basic helicopter so you have more room, and this allows for more comfortable seating, plus you will ride in climate controlled comfort. The aircraft has a 180-degree panoramic windshield for the best views below you, plus the chopper is designed to give you a nice, smooth flight. The older-style helicopters used in he basic tours aren't nearly as comfortable or as nice. Options In Air Tours First of all, decide if you want to land at the canyon and add on some adventures, or if you just want to fly over the region and circle back to Vegas. Both tours give you an aerial overview of the Colorado River, the West Rim of the Grand Canyon, Lake Mead, and the Hoover Dam, but the only tours that set down at the canyon are the landing tours. The air-only tours take you over all the main landmarks and scenic high points in the region and the fly on back to Vegas without landing. You'll see the same sights on a landing tour but you'll also get to land on the top or bottom of the rim and get out and enjoy fun activities on foot. The champagne picnic tour is particularly fun because it comes with an exhilarating descent to the canyon floor along with a champagne toast once you get there. However, that's just the start of your fun because you can also add on a pontoon boat ride along the Colorado River and tickets to walk out on the world-famous glass Skywalk. Once you settle on a tour, it's important you book it online as soon as you can. Seats on Grand Canyon helicopter tours fill up fast. Booking early ensures you get a seat on the tour and it is also a great way to get a good discount on the price. To be on the safe side, you may want to go ahead and book your tour at the same time you make your hotel reservations so everything is locked in place. If you wait until 48 hours in advance, the tour will probably be full and if it isn't, it's likely you'll have to pay more for the same seats. Once tour day arrives, be sure to dress for the weather at the canyon. Summertime is hot at the canyon and 100 degree temperatures are common. Wear comfortable clothes that breathe on you so you can stay as cool as possible. Carry extra water with you and protect yourself from the sun by wearing sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen. Don't forget to wear sturdy shoes too if you plan on walking around the canyon. Salty snacks will keep hunger at bay and give you energy for exploring the canyon in the hot sun.   The chopper tours that depart from the Vegas Strip are convenient and offer the utmost in comfort and options. You'll get an aerial view of Vegas as well as free limo transportation. Fortunately, these tours utilize the EcoStar 130 chopper, so no matter where you sit, you'll get a great view. All these perks make these tours very popular, so you want to book yours as early as you can. If you delay, the tour may be sold out, and if you do get a seat, you'll probably have to pay more for it. \n  is a huge fan of helicopter tours and recommends readers visit this page for helicopter tour reviews and this page for latest deals and promotions:   05 Oct   70  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:37:17.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
