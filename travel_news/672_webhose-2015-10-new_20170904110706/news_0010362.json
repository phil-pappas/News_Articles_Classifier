It was painful to watch. To see us lose, especially in convincing fashion, was tough to take – and then to be ejected from Rugby World Cup 2015 . It’s going to be a tough ask to pick themselves back up and go out and play that game in Manchester next week. But they’ve got to shift their focus to training and getting up for their last game. Scrum times were the hardest to watch. You could see what was going on and they weren’t able to rectify it. That’s just an observation that I don’t think they’ll be pleased with. The lads will be hurting from that. It will take some time to rebuild. Everyone is different in these situations. They all have different support networks They’ve all worked very hard all summer and all through this competition and over the past four years. Not to achieve what they aimed for is a tough pill to swallow. It will take a little bit of time to mourn and get over it. Then you’ve got to try and turn it into some positive motivation going forward for the rest of your career. Everyone is different in these situations. They all have different support networks. Some guys will have their their wife, girlfriend, and perhaps their kids at Pennyhill Park with them. That will be their comfort and they might need that. Whereas other guys might need some space and a bit of time to digest what’s just happened. Bouncing back Being a professional sportsman is always a journey of highs and lows. It’s very rare to find one who has had nothing but smooth sailing and highs their whole career. I lost a Premiership final at a very young age with London Irish. Losing in the semi-final last year with Northampton Saints after finishing first in the league was another bitter pill to swallow. I just think this one will be an even bigger pill just because of the four-year build up and the time and dedication that they’ve put into it. They’ve also had the expectations of the country on their shoulders. I sent some good luck texts before the match but I haven’t sent any post-match. They’ll need time to deal with it. It's hard to criticise anyone in that team. They played their hearts out and they played for their country. Once the dust settles I’m sure it will spur on a lot of boys to achieve greatness and raise the bar Although it didn’t come off, you can't fault their effort and what they put into it. They put their bodies on the line, made massive sacrifices and gave everything they had. Some people will ask if a lot of these players can go again in Japan in 2019. Four years is a long time away, especially in sport. I can only relate to my own experience in 2011, when we exited the World Cup. I remember that I just used it as a positive to motivate me going forward. I made sure I worked harder and improved. Once the dust settles I’m sure it will spur on a lot of boys to achieve greatness and raise the bar. The future definitely looks bright going into 2019. There are a lot of talented players in that squad who have a long career ahead of them. There’s a crop of young guys who will also come in by that time and raise the bar even higher. Personally I’m just going to take each season as it comes. Right now my focus is on Saints : getting in the team, putting down a good marker in the Premiership and in Europe and trying to win some silverware with the boys. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:44:43.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
