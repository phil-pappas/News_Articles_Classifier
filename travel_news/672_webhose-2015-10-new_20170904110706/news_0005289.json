For a limited time, Castle will offer “Fall4Hawaii,” featuring four exclusive incentives for new bookings, including 40 percent off room rates, free room upgrades, free parking and HawaiianMiles for every dollar spent.\n \n“With today’s booking window getting shorter, our Fall4Hawaii promotion offers an additional incentive – well, four in fact – to encourage travel during the fall season to Hawaii,” said president and COO Alan Mattson. “It’s not too late to fall for Hawaii, and we hope to see travelers taking advantage of this great offer to experience a memorable Hawaiian vacation.”\n \nAmong Castle’s participating properties are Halii Kai at Waikoloa, Kona Bali Kai, Kona Reef Hotel, Hilo Hawaiian Hotel, Kanaloa at Kona, and Waimea Country Lodge on the Big Island; Kamaole Sands and Paki Maui on Maui; Molokai Shores on Molokai; Waikiki Shore and Waikiki Grand Hotel on Oahu; and Kaha Lani, Kiahuna Plantation & The Beach Bungalows, Makahuena at Poipu, Poipu Shores, and Mokihana on Kauai.\n \nThe “Fall4Hawaii” promotion is valid through December 15, 2015. Room upgrades apply to the same room category only and are subject to availability. Free parking upgrade does not apply at participating Oahu properties. Guests must also present their HawaiianMiles membership card in order to earn additional miles.\n \nSource:-Castle Resorts & Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:19:49.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
