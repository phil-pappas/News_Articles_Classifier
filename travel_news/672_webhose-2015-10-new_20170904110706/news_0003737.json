While no opening date has been set, Disneyland will break ground in 2016 on the project in the Big Thunder Ranch area of the park. \nStarting Jan. 10, Disney plans to halt river traffic on the looping waterway ringing Tom Sawyer Island, mothball the locomotive trains circling the park and suspend the \"Fantasmic\" nighttime spectacular for an undisclosed amount of time.

That means Disneyland will need to carve another 11 acres out of the park. But where? There are basically three options: north toward Ball Road in a backstage area of the park, east toward Toontown or -- the likeliest possibility -- west toward the Rivers of America. Disneyland officials have been quick to tamp down rumors that Toontown is in danger of being scrapped to make room for Star Wars Land. 2What attractions will be in Star Wars Land? Advertisement As you might expect, Disney is being vague about the details. On paper, the two unnamed attractions sound a whole lot like Star Tours. The first ride promises a battle between the First Order and the Resistance. The second attraction will put visitors behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon. How a Millennium Falcon mission will be different from a flight aboard the Starspeeder 3000 spacecraft in Star Tours remains to be seen. 3What could the closures mean for the future layout of Disneyland? Will Tom Sawyer Island shrink? The northern portion of Tom Sawyer Island has been off limits to visitors for more than a decade. Fort Wilderness has stood on the northern point since Tom Sawyer Island opened in 1956. After years of deterioration, the wooden log fort closed to the public in 2003, but continued to serve as a costuming area for \"Fantasmic\" performers. 4Will the Rivers of America get shorter? With a smaller Tom Sawyer Island, Disney would be forced to shorten the looping Rivers of America, which would require the Mark Twain riverboat and Columbia sailing ship to be rerouted and retracked. With the river drained, Disney might also upgrade the underwater technical elements of \"Fantasmic.\" \nDraining the river during California's prolonged drought could prove a public-relations nightmare. The 4- to 8-foot-deep man-made river held 6.16 million gallons of water when it was filled in 1955. Disneyland officials say the river will be partially drained during construction with the water diverted, treated, stored and ultimately reused in the Rivers of America. 5Will Disneyland connect Critter Country to Star Wars Land? Critter Country has always presented a circulation problem for Disneyland. The route to nowhere forces visitors to make a U-turn to escape a dead-end cul-de-sac. Similarly, the Big Thunder Ranch area of the park has long been a no-man's land with little to attract visitors in the way of rides or retail. \nCreating a pathway along the back side of the newly shortened Rivers of America would solve an age-old circulation problem and help ease traffic congestion to and from Star Wars Land when it opens. 6Are there riverboats in outer space? While the Mark Twain riverboat, Columbia sailing ship and Davy Crockett's Explorer canoes might fit in thematically with Frontierland, Adventureland and Critter Country, they likely won't mesh very well with \"a galaxy far, far away.\" \nDisney will have to do something to shield the new themed land from the bustling river traffic, which means a portion of the reconfigured waterway might be bounded by a faux rock wall similar to the Ornament Valley buttes in Cars Land.
