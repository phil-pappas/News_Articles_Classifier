Influential figures like NSW Premier Mike Baird, Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore and Committee for Sydney CEO Tim Williams also provide their views on the future of Sydney and ICC Sydney as Australia’s premier convention, exhibition and entertainment precinct. Geoff Donaghy, CEO of ICC Sydney, said the self-published title marks another milestone for the organisation as it ramps up its marketing activity in the lead up to the venue’s December 2016 launch. “Sydney Views is a first for the convention centre market and showcases all elements that make Sydney a thriving hub of activity and global talent, ticking the boxes of culture, commerce and innovation. This new magazine helps reinforce Sydney’s reputation as one of the most desirable meeting and event destinations in the world, with ICC Sydney at its heart.” Sydney Views will be distributed directly to ICC Sydney’s extensive national and international client base, at key industry events including the AIPC Asia Summit in Singapore this week, via partners such as Business Events Australia, and through outlets such as Qantas’ Sydney Business Lounge.
