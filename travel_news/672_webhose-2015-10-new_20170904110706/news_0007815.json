Fliers can start free streaming Netflix for passengers’ laptops, tablets, and smartphones on faster Wi-Fi now. But take advantage of this perk ASAP: Virgin will evaluate pricing options after March 2, 2016.\nThe fact that Virgin is upping its onboard entertainment game comes as no surprise. In the past couple of years, airlines have started to add more amenities to their repertoire in an attempt to ease customers’ increasing frustrations with air travel. Whether it’s an in-flight concert on a domestic flight or a luxurious spa bathroom on an international flight, airlines are really pulling out all of the stops to get people excited about flying again. Some of the extras might seem a tad over the top, but these days, when it comes to flying, it really is the little (and big) things that count.\nFor those who prefer to travel with added benefits, here are 10 more of the most creative and enticing airline amenities available now:\nEmirates Airline Shower Spa\nWith a controversial new $20 million commercial starring Jennifer Aniston , Emirates is pretty much the “one percenter” in the airline industry. Passage can cost more than a car, but if you do have the money to shell out for a first-class ticket, you’ll at least get a proper shower. The airline offers a bathroom suite with a shower, heated floors, Bulgari toiletries, and a closet and vanity.\nIn-flight humidifiers on Lufthansa\nThis summer, Lufthansa installed air humidifiers in the first-class cabin of its double-decker airliners. The intent is to make passengers feel more refreshed after a better night’s sleep on a long overseas flight. While the humidity level in economy class will remain at its lowly 20 percent, first class will breathe easier in upwards of 25 percent.\nLive at 35 Southwest\nSouthwest has always prided itself on being the cheeriest U.S. airline. As nice as it is, the singing flight attendants weren’t always welcomed by disgruntled travelers. Seeing a real band perform in the aisle, though? That’s pretty cool. The airline implemented this series a couple of years ago and has since had bands like Imagine Dragons, O.A.R., and the Plain White T’s perform surprise concerts on domestic flights. Hey, it’s better than an off-pitch stewardess.\nAir New Zealand’s Skycouch\nIn New Zealand’s economy class, travelers have the option of booking a Skycouch, which is essentially comprised of three regular seats that can be folded out into a futon. Getting three empty seats by luck is great, but a real couch takes the cake on a long journey.\nSingapore Airlines’ Wedgwood china\nNo plastic or tinfoil in this first class—Singapore Airlines recently added beautiful Wedgwood china to its dining service. Dishes served on board like lobster thermidor, seafood congee, and braised short ribs will surely look even more delectable on these exquisite, expensive new plates.\nPersonal mini bars on Etihad Airways\nEtihad’s first-class suites offer amenities like a Poltrona Frau leather-upholstered seat and ottoman and a 24-inch TV, but the mini bar just may be the best part. Hitting the call button for a mid-flight martini might become a thing of the past as passengers are offered their own personal en suite beverage stock—mini bottles of wine and spirits included.\nJetBlue x Birchbox\nJetBlue’s entire business model is based on the idea that everyone should be offered amenities while traveling. The airline hands out free snacks and has free DIRECTV and no official first class. However, it recently began offering a new premium service—that seems a lot like first class—called Mint, for which passengers pay a bit more for fully reclining seats, fresher dining options, and high-end beauty products from such brands as Caudelie, Klorane, and Davines, all courtesy of Birchbox.\nAir Malta Sky Spa\nAir Malta debuted in-flight massage treatments this summer for economy passengers. The service is offered on short flights from Malta to and from Gatwick airport, just outside of London, and includes hand, neck, and foot massages along with beauty product samples and the option to listen to soothing music while receiving the treatments. Let’s hope this almost unbelievable offering spreads to more airlines in the coming years.\nDelta’s program with Porsche for gate transfer\nDelta started a trial program with Porsche back in 2011, testing a service that gave the airline’s elite travelers the chance to transfer to a connecting flight by getting picked up plane-side by a Porsche. Unsurprisingly, the program was a hit, and now elite Delta customers can be transported in style at airports all across the U.S.\nFrette linens on Qatar Airways\nWith a dining menu conceived by Nobu Matsuhisa, dessert by Ladurée, and amenity kits from Armani, it’s not shocking that Qatar’s business-class travelers are also tucked in with plush Frette linens at bedtime. Costing upwards of $1,000 for a sheet set, this is the bedding found at some of the most luxurious hotels around the world. No more itchy pillows and flimsy blankets on this flight.", "external_links": ["http://www.etihad.com/en-us/experience-etihad/on-board/first-class/", "http://fortune.com/2015/10/07/emirates-jennifer-aniston/", "http://www.airnewzealand.com/economy-skycouch", "http://www.qatarairways.com/global/experience/A350/en/#business-class", "http://www.jetblue.com/flying-on-jetblue/mint/", "https://www.airmalta.com/information/about/news-overview/news-detail/air-malta-launches-first-ever-spa-experience-onboard", "http://www.emirates.com/us/english/flying/cabin_features/first_class/first_class.aspx", "https://www.southwest.com/entertainment/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3147410/The-class-cabin-AIR-posh-Lufthansa-added-humidifiers-help-passengers-feel-fresher-arrival.html", "http://news.delta.com/porsche-service-expands-lga-sea-and-dtw"], "published": "2015-10-24T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:06:48.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
