I think they've seen glimpses of Rugby World Cup 2015 and George. Television is not readily available in Mathare, but they have been looking out for him. It's a strange one really, because the more George achieves, as a player, a person , and of course at this Rugby World Cup, the greater the hope generated with many families and children 4,000 miles away. That's the beauty of sport, and sporting role models. And rugby has always stood for supporting communities and I hope we see that today in the players: never being too big or too famous to lose that connection to the support network that got them to where they are today. I think that's why so many of us believe so deeply in the values of rugby, which creates strong people in a very testing physical environment, but also makes us realise we need others. We all need nurturing, we all need experience. In every home, Llandovery College pupils will be watching George North and his every move That talk of nurture and experience and the match against Australia last weekend set me back to thinking about George when he was at Llandovery College. It was intriguing to see George playing at centre against Australia. Obviously, he is at his most devastating when he has space on the wing. But George spent two years at Llandovery College in the First XV playing in the centre, so that has probably helped him in some ways. It won't have felt unusual. He was also very, very good there. I actually texted him about it before the game and reminded him of his two years playing centre here. I told him those two years would hold him in good stead against Australia. He was defensively brilliant and came so close to scoring a try in a desperately close, but quite brilliant match. When George came to us, he was already with the Scarlets Academy, under Kevin George who was head of the academy. We set up a programme with Kevin so that George was not playing too much, and I think that's always important when you are developing a young player with a great deal of potential. Faraway, so close: George brings home to the pupils at the school As a 16- and 17-year-old, there are so many things George was able to learn about the game, and we're very proud of the way we helped to nurture him. I think other teams are very wary of George. I don't think he likes setting himself up as a target, but I think he accepts the fact that as he gets more and more caps he is inevitably a targeted player. One thing I can reveal about George is that he is not afraid of failure. He doesn't fear it. He'll always put himself up for a challenge. There must have been games where the winning and losing was dependent on what he did. Rob Howley described this Wales team as “battle hardened”. I think that's probably the positive translation of battle weary. They've had some really hard games. But we've got a better a chance of beating South Africa than we had against Australia. And we know they had the potential to win the game against Australia. I'm sure they'll be very positive about the way they approach the South Africa game. Here at Llandovery College, the interest has been off the scale, and the common rooms have been full to the brim for all the matches. It's half-term this weekend when George and Wales run out against the Springboks, but in every home our pupils will be watching George North and his every move. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:42:35.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
