The new system will allow the hotel to reclaim and reuse its laundry wastewater, conserving precious resources all while offering its guests premium eco-conscious accommodations. \n“California is in a four-year drought, and as we sought ways to answer Governor Brown’s call to conserve water, our engineering team looked for ways to reduce our water usage on property,” states Shore Hotel General Manager Joe Velasquez. “AquaRecycle® allows the hotel to recycle our laundry wastewater, which results in not only a cost savings, but water, energy, and emissions reduction, reinforcing our commitment to sustainability.” \nThe oceanfront hotel is a leader in sustainability among Santa Monica's luxury hotels and the only newly-built LEED Gold certified hotel in the city, which also received the City’s prestigious 2015 Sustainable Quality Awards (SQA) Grand Prize, which recognizes businesses that make significant achievements in the categories of sustainable economic development, social responsibility, and stewardship of the environment. \nOver the last 10 years of recycling, AquaRecycle® has recycled over 3 billion gallons of laundry wash water and project almost 1 billion additional gallons recycled in the next rolling 12 months. Its tremendous growth has brought the total systems installed to 150 systems and it expects to break 200 systems in the coming 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:17:50.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
