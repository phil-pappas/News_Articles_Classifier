In sacred rituals, devotees known as \"Mah Song\" or \"Spirit Horses\" work themselves into trances to have all manner of items pierced through their cheeks, from daggers and swords to a bicycle. Then they dance as massive strings of fireworks explode all around them. AP \nA devotee enters a trance before being pierced at Thailand's Vegetarian festival. \nThe annual festival in Phuket has become a tourist attraction, with several large, noisy processions complete with fireworks, gongs and drums passing through the streets. Many Phuket residents have Chinese ancestors, and devotees to the many Chinese temples on the island parade their shrines' emperor gods on hand-carried carriages. \nThe Vegetarian Festival begins on the eve of the ninth lunar month of the Chinese calendar and is observed primarily in Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Myanmar. It traces its origins to the early 1800s, when a troupe of Chinese actors on tour in Phuket fell ill. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:38:00.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
