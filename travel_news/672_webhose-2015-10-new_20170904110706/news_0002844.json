Guests can also make use of interactive lecterns containing original insider destination content, free drinks in the evenings and paperless check-in and check-out facilities. \n\nPeter Henley, CEO of Onyx Hospitality Group, said: “Vietnam is one of the region’s fastest-growing travel destinations, and we are excited to have Ozo Hoi An as part of our continuing expansion plans. With the increasing popularity of Vietnam’s South Central Coast among regional and international visitors, we have identified a gap in the market for a select service hotel like Ozo.” \n\nThe first Ozo-branded hotel opened in 2013 and is now currently available in five locations in Asia including Hong Kong, Pattaya, Koh Samui, Colombo and Kandy. The group also has several more Ozo hotels in the pipeline in locations such as Penang, Iskandar and Xiamen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:33:40.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
