The new property, operated by Soho House & Co., is situated in the Oxfordshire countryside, a 90-minute drive or 75-minute train ride from London—and truly a world away.\nThe couple can exchange vows at either the nearby historic 11th-century village church in Great Tew or the on-site Hay Barn for a nondenominational ceremony, followed by a reception on the Marquee Green for up to 250 people, dinner in the Sperry Tent, and a rollicking party in the Barwell Barn. The venue seems tailor-made for weddings, but the most alluring part is that the Soho Farmhouse is so much more than just a wedding venue. The property can accommodate up to 140 overnight guests—between the 40 cabins, the farmhouse, and the four-bedroom cottage—for a full weekend of fun. It’s practically begging to be turned into a grown-up camp entirely populated with the couple’s favorite people.\nGuests’ cars are whisked away upon arrival and traded for a pair of Wellington boots and a Foffa bike (guests are encouraged to provide height and shoe measurements when they reserve their rooms to ensure the proper fit)—although waiting horse and carts or an electric tuk-tuk will shuttle guests about the 100-acre property if a full farm-fresh meal (think stew, suckling pig, and a sampling of the more than 500 fruits and vegetables grown on-site) from one of the six on-site restaurants has rendered an immediate nap a necessity. And if, post-nap, the mood to snack strikes, two reconditioned milk trucks have been converted into mobile restaurants serving up all manner of traditional English comfort food, while two other trucks have been turned into mobile bars.\nAmid the restored 18th-century farmhouses (that blend seamlessly with the newer buildings), there is a pub, flower shop, deli, private movie theater, Cowshed spa, a boathouse with an indoor and outdoor swimming pool, grass tennis courts, a softball field, a soccer pitch, a stable that’s home to 11 horses, three man-made lakes, and an ice rink in the winter. Though, of course, guests can also hide away in the thoughtfully appointed rooms—inspired by “upstate New York cabin culture.” The cabins, for example, are fitted with cooktops and refrigerators, and some feature wood-burning stoves, balconies, and outdoor bathtubs. With so much on offer, perhaps the Soho Farmhouse can check one more wedding-related box: the perfect location for a post-wedding mini-moon .", "external_links": ["https://www.sohofarmhouse.com/weddings"], "published": "2015-10-07T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:04:29.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
