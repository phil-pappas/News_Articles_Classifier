The carrier became Allegheny Airlines in 1952, then USAir and finally US Airways. \nThere's another nostalgic note for aviation buffs who get misty about yet another carrier joining the ranks of Pan Am, TWA, Braniff, Northwest, Western and others: Flight 1939 is a red eye. \nAmerican Airlines officials plan a ceremonial event at the gate before the flight takes off from SFO at 9:55 p.m. \nUS Airways' most famous moment came toward the end of its long lifespan when, in 2009, Sullenberger made a daring landing of his Flight 1549, disabled after hitting a flock of geese, in the middle of New York's Hudson River. All 155 people onboard survived. Hailed as a hero, Danville resident Sullenberger wrote two books on the experience and retired after 30 years as a pilot.
