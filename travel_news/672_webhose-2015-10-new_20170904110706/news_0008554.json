The company has been running for more than two decades and has brought innovation to both grooming and finance. In 2009, it issued the world’s first “mini-bond”, inspiring an alternative finance market, AltFi, whereby companies could obtain funding through crowdfunding and other methods - removing the need for a traditional bank loan. King stepped down as chief executive last year, handing over to his right-hand man Andy Hill, but remains the largest shareholder and adviser to the company. He now works extensively as a mentor for SMEs through his consultancy business, Entrepreneur in Residence. Last month, he co-founded ad agency Savage & King with his wife Tiger Savage, a creative director. King has been awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Portsmouth, adding to accolades including becoming a fellow of University Campus Suffolk and the Royal Society of Arts. • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T22:59:26.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
