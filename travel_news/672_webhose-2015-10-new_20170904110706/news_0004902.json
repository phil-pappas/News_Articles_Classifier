Spending time around humans can lull animals into a false sense of security \nEvidence for this comes from studies of \"flight initiation distance\", which is a measure of how close to a threat an animal is willing to be before it tries to escape. \nResearchers have found that the wild animals living around people in urban areas have smaller \"flight initiation distances\" than animals living in rural areas, where humans are more scarce. \nIn one experiment, urban fox squirrels allowed people to get seven times closer to them before running away, compared with fox squirrels in rural areas. (Similar patterns have been observed with birds.) \nThe foxes that were used to people also had a tamped-down response to the vocalisations of their predators, according to a 2009 study published in Landscape Ecology . \n2. Animals become less alert to danger \nEven when people ignore the wildlife around them, they tend to create a \"human shield\" that protects certain animals that would otherwise wind up as prey. That's because their predators are afraid to penetrate the human shield to hunt. \nAs a result, the prey animals become less vigilant to threats. \nWhen ecotourists venture into the wild, they create what amounts to a \"temporary human shield\", the study authors wrote. \nEvidence for this comes from Grand Teton National Park, where the more tourist traffic there was, the less time pronghorn sheep and elk spent in \"alert postures\", according to a 2014 report in PLOS One . The animals also gathered in smaller groups when more tourists were nearby. \nThere's even biological evidence that some animals (such as iguanas ) exposed to tourists produce fewer stress hormones. \n3. Ecotourism may make life easier for poachers \nSome animals, such as elephants, are able to distinguish between threatening and non-threatening humans. But other animals are less savvy. \nField researchers have found that gorillas and Barbary macaques that have become habituated to tourists were slower to hide, flee or attack when poachers approached. \nThese risks may mean that ecotourism should be added to the list of human activities that are making the world less hospitable for wildlife â€“ a list that includes issues such as climate change, deforestation and pollution, the ecologists wrote. \nSomething to think about before you book your next vacation. \nLA Times/TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:05:37.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
