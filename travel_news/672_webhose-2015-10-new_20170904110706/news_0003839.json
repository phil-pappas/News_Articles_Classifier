Renee Wagner, RRP, director of marketing at Grand Pacific Resorts, presented the check to Terra Schaad, executive director of Hunkapi, at the organization’s stable in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n“We are humbled and grateful,” said Schaad. “It was an afternoon of pure joy. I want to thank ResorTime for what you do and for considering us in your contributions.” Hunkapi entered the contest for the second quarter of 2015, competing with the Pro Player Foundation and Project Athena.\nThousands of people voted and overwhelmingly supported Hunkapi. Inspired by their support, ResorTime also launched a “10 for 10” offer, in which vacationers save ten percent on their booking and ten percent of the proceeds go back to Hunkapi. The goal is to double the donation by raising another $2,500. This amount would provide an additional 30 hours of therapy to a child with autism. Owners and guests are invited to visit ResorTime.com/First-and-Ten for the promo code.\n“Our giving program, beCause Destination Matters, is special because it supports the causes that matter to our owners and guests,” said Wagner. “It provides everyone an opportunity to give back at any level. You may submit a story, vote, share, or book a vacation.”\nOn the day of the check presentation, Hunkapi also provided a two-hour therapeutic riding session to cancer survivor Renee Figueroa, who is also an adoptive mother of four children with special needs. A video of the special day can be viewed at https://youtu.be/-_gQXZQQB5A .\nThe Figueroa family lives in Glendale, Arizona, and also spent a week at Grand Pacific Palisades Resort & Hotel in Carlsbad, California, in May 2015 courtesy of Grand Pacific Resorts. The management company provides two such vacations through Send Me On Vacation (SMOV), which works with breast cancer survivors.\nAccording to Wagner, “Hunkapi touched the hearts of the people who matter to us, and we wanted to do more than just write a check. We were thrilled when we realized that the Figueroa family lives in the area and could benefit from Hunkapi’s services.”\nAbout ResorTime\nResorTime offers nightly rentals at resorts in the United States, Mexico, Caribbean, and Canada, making it one of the largest condominium rental services.
