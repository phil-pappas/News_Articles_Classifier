It is to be called ADAM, standing for Art & Design Atomium Museum. It will be located in the Expo Park alongside the famous Atomium monument, easily accessible from all the hotels in town. \nThe museum will be one of a kind, as it will house the permanent Plasticarium exhibition, dedicated entirely to every kind of object made from plastics, illustrating how this material changed our lives in so many ways. The plan is to rotate the exhibits on an annual basis, so the museum will always be worth a further visit. Facilities for group events have been a high priority in the design of the new centre. The Auditorium will seat 250 delegates theatre style or 350 for a buffet/reception. The Agora entrance space can be added, so that up to 500 guests can attend a reception, whilst a Gallery will seat 70 or host 120 for drinks. Full details at www.adamuseum.be .
