Services such as 24-hour reception and security, housekeeping, laundry and dry cleaning will also be available. \n\nLee Chee Koon, CEO of Ascott, said: “Cambodia has achieved sustained economic growth amid greater political stability. We expect demand for serviced residences to grow given its economic progress and the absence of international-standard serviced residence in the country. \n\n“As the first international serviced residence operator in Cambodia, Ascott will gain first-mover advantage to capture the underserved accommodation segment.” \n\nSomerset Norodom adds to Ascott’s South-east Asian portfolio, now boasting 13,000 units spread across 74 properties in nine countries in the region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:29:04.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
