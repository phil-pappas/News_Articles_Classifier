Scotland is the Perfect Stage for events of all shapes and sizes. We have a highly valued and active relationship with both ISES and IMEX and are delighted to be hosting this significant event during the Year of Innovation, Architecture & Design in 2016.” Carina Bauer, IMEX Group CEO also said: “We have been working with ISES for a number of years across both our shows. We are delighted to be cementing that relationship further by partnering with this important new ISES event in Europe. We are also looking forward to exposing new, high profile buyers to the benefits of our Frankfurt tradeshow and hope that they and their teams will derive great benefit from the combination of our events.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:27:29.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
