Already visited by more than 150,000 people a year, the added facilities will make access even easier and no doubt attract many more visitors, especially from families where one of the members lives with such challenges. \nA special 250-meter long walkway has been constructed with audio guides, permitting even individuals in a wheelchair to get all information about the site. A permanent exhibition under the theme “Belouve’s history is also a legacy of mankind” was also part of the improvements to the site and now offers audio and visual aids for visitors with special needs, and the Belouve Cottage was remodeled to cater to such visitors.
