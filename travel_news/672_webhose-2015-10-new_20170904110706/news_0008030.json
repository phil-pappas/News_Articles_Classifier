Many Phuket residents have Chinese ancestors, and devotees to the many Chinese temples on the island parade their shrines' emperor gods on hand-carried carriages.\nThe Vegetarian Festival begins on the eve of the ninth lunar month of the Chinese calendar and is observed primarily in Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Myanmar. It traces its origins to the early 1800s, when a troupe of Chinese actors on tour in Phuket fell ill. It was decided that they should abstain from eating meat and soon all were well again.\nThe festival and its sacred rituals are believed to bestow good fortune.
