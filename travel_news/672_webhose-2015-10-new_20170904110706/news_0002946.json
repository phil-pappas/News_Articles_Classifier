It looks like the $25 billion service is here to stay, at least until something more innovative comes along to provide alternatives to the traditional hotel industry. \nFor many travelers – and not just those in their 20's and 30's – Airbnb is providing more choices, particularly in expensive cities or communities where there is a dearth of affordable hotel rooms. And now the service is reaching out to business travelers to make it easier for them to find homelike accommodations while on the road. \nI've stayed in five Airbnbs – from Providence, R.I., to Orlando, Fla., to New York City to Paris and Berlin – and for the most part the experiences have been positive. I welcomed the chance for short-term stays in full apartments with family or friends instead of cramped, overpriced hotel rooms. \nThat's not to say the service hasn't had its horror stories. In July, a 19-year-old Massachusetts man reported he was held captive and sexually molested by his Airbnb host in Madrid. And websites such as airbnbhell.com, Trustpilot and Quora abound with stories of absent hosts, last-minute cancellations, filthy rooms, apartment doors that don't lock and profile descriptions that misrepresent the place. On the flip side, hosts have found their homes wrecked by disruptive guests or personal items stolen. \nThe New York full apartment we booked had a great location near Times Square and its room photos depicted the place fairly accurately (it was clean and had strong Wi-Fi). Yet our stay was disrupted by a ridiculously loud party in an apartment next door. The pounding music didn't end until 3:30 a.m. \nIn Berlin in August, we loved our large, two-bedroom apartment, which was airy and modern and just footsteps from a U-Bahn stop. What the profile didn't mention was that it overlooked a cemetery. That didn't bother us, but it could have spooked others. \nGuests can have bad experiences in hotels, too. I've stayed in a pricey boutique hotel in New York City that was infested with bedbugs and a historic resort in Central Pennsylvania that charged 5-star prices but delivered 2-star service. \nClearly you've got to be an intrepid traveler to give Airbnb a go. My twenty-something kids are frequent users and haven't yet had any problems, but I always hold my breath when I click the button to book a place. \nI do get a thrill when it turns out to be a gem. I was delighted with the breakfast of homemade granola, yogurt, fruit and French-press coffee that my host prepared each morning during my stay near Orlando. She had a lovely designer's home full of modern artwork, and I had a whole wing of the house to myself. She and her Scottish husband, empty-nesters, opened up their home to Airbnb travelers because they loved meeting interesting people and had hosted guests from New Zealand to Nova Scotia. It was $77 a night (plus cleaning and booking fees) instead of the $240 I would have paid for a hotel in the same neighborhood. \nThen there was the owner of our lovely and meticulously clean Paris apartment this past August, who spent a half-hour explaining the neighborhood and all the local sites. He even arranged a cab for us for our early-morning departure the day we left. \nI first tried Airbnb in Providence a couple of years ago to visit my children at college. Even the cheapest hotel room – with fees and taxes – tops $200 a night. \nI found a place for $70 a night, a bedroom with private half-bath in a duplex along a 1.6-mile linear park perfect for my morning jogs. The owner was a doctor who quit after two years to study art; her husband was a composer. They made me feel welcome and the stay overall was what I needed – affordable and where I wanted it. \nAn important caution is that Airbnb does not do background checks on hosts or guests. This can pose a risk for both parties. Airbnb did not make any official available for comment or questions, but on its website the company believes it has put in place checks and balances in the form of reviews and verified ID and customer profiles. \nLike other sites in the sharing economy, guests rate the host and the host rates the guest. A writer for Business Insider recently complained that because the reviews are not anonymous, guests would feel pressured to write just positive reviews because they feared they might be rejected by future hosts. \nIndeed, a spot check of reviews of Airbnb bookings shows mostly glowing descriptions. \"The property was exactly as described and in the pictures.\"\"Gorgeous apartment, even better than description.\"\"Lovely place, would stay again!\" \nIn explaining its review policy, Airbnb writes: \"Our community is built on trust, and trust comes from honest conversation. Therefore, we ask for reviews that are truthful, clear and helpful to both the review's recipient and the wider Airbnb community. ... We strongly discourage personal insults, opinion that's not backed up by examples, or generally unsociable behavior.\" \nIt doesn't censor, but \"we may take the extraordinary step of disallowing or removing reviews or review responses. We reserve the right to remove reviews that violate review guidelines.\" \nIn July 2014, Airbnb made a change to its review policy, in which reviews are revealed to the hosts and guests simultaneously. It also offers a place for private messages so guests can share concerns about their stay. Join the conversation and share your voice. \nShow Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:00:39.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
