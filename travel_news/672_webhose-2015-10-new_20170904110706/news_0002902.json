TAT hopes to better equalise the revenue mix. \n\n“The government has shifted the focus towards the domestic economy and consequently TAT has to follow suit. We are adjusting the budget to focus more on domestic tourism,” explained Yuthasak, stressing that this is a supplement rather than a replacement of TAT’s role in promoting Thailand overseas. \n\nPlans include developing new attractions and catalysing new markets by promoting and making information more readily available. \n\n“Last year, we launched a campaign called 12 Hidden Gems and we recorded about a 20 per cent increase in traffic numbers. The more information you provide, the more people think about travelling,” added Yuthasak. \n\nAmong the places set to emerge as new destinations are Lampang and Nan in northern Thailand, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Ranong in the south, as well as Buriram in the north-east.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:51:22.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
