The move by EPA of raising the mile per gallons standards to 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 and then 54.5 mpg by 2025 actually helped the die casting industry as the auto industry concluded the only way they can get to those mileage standards is by light weighting the vehicles. Aluminum, and specifically aluminum die castings, in many of the power train and engine areas, are the only way they've concluded they could achieve this.\nThis is one of the major reasons for the predicted growth of the industry in the area of structural die-castings too. Further, aluminum is becoming increasingly popular material for this purpose due to its ability to be easily recycled. Approximately 75% of aluminum consumed can be reused, and reclaimed aluminum can be recycled indefinitely, making it's the most popular material for automotive part die-casting.\nNorth America is the largest market for automotive aluminum die casting globally. This huge market in the region was mainly due to large-scale domestic production, government initiative and availability of resources. Rockman Industries, Castwel Auto parts Pvt. Ltd., Endurance Group, Dynacast, Sandhar technologies limited, Gibbs die casting group and Die casting solution GmbH are some of the key players in the market.\nThe market is segmented based on the production process type, by application type and by geography type. In a nutshell, automobile makers are now focusing on collaborating with the part die casting manufacturers in order to produce fuel-efficient and lightweight automobiles.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1.
