Customers are being offered 250,000 frequent flyer points if they sign up to a new home loan deal. Picture: Supplied Source: ThinkStock\nFIND the best home loan deal possible\nBut the deal has been criticised by financial experts — they warn customers shouldn’t be enticed by these offers when signing up to one of the biggest financial commitments in their life.\nThe deal rolled out by National Australia Bank is being targeted strictly at owner-occupiers, and could ignite competition among financial institutions all desperate to snare a bigger slice of the market share.\nFinancial comparison website iSelect’s spokeswoman Laura Crowden said customers should instead look at the bigger picture when locking themselves into a long-term mortgage deal.\n“We always encourage consumers to carefully review the fine print of home loan special offers or incentives to ensure that the advertised loan will meet their needs over the longer term by providing a competitive interest rate and competitive ongoing fees,’’ she said.\niSelect figures show on a $300,000, 30-year home loan, the average standard variable rate is 4.55 per cent and monthly repayments are $1528.\nThe average rate on a three-year fixed loan is 4.38 per cent and the monthly repayments are $1498. Read carefully ... Home loan customers should focus on the fees, charges and interest rates that apply to a home loan before they sign the dotted line.
