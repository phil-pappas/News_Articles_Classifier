(AP) â€” A 43-year-old man has been criminally charged in connection with breaking a $120,000 glass sculpture at the Tacoma Art Museum .\nThe News Tribune reports ( http://goo.gl/3b98WN ) the man has been charged with one count of first-degree malicious mischief in the Friday incident.\nCourt documents say the man entered a closed exhibit and knocked a Dale Chihuly sculpture titled \"Gilded Lavender Ikebana with Lapis Stem and Two Leaves\" to the floor, shattering it. Chihuly is a Washington state native known for his colorful, other-worldly glass creations.\nThe man reportedly was stopped by museum staff who confronted him as he headed toward another closed exhibit.\nCourt records show the charged Tacoma man has a history of mental illness. He pleaded not guilty Monday in Superior Court and remains in jail on $20,000 bail.\n___\nInformation from: The News Tribune, http://www.thenewstribune.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://goo.gl/3b98WN", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:40:40.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
