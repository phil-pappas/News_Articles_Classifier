The crowds get smaller, but we want to be here. As long as I'm breathing, I'll be here,\" said Tom Acquaviva, 81, who lost his son, Paul Acquaviva.\nFILE- In this Sept. 11, 2014 file photo, David Pykon, right, and his fiancé Shelli Scrimale embrace while observing the 13th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center at the north pool of the memorial in New York.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File) Carrying photos emblazoned with the names of their loved ones, victims' relatives praised first responders, thanked the armed forces and hoped for peace and security: \"Pray to our God to keep America safe and give the politicians the knowledge to keep America safe,\" said Maria Perez, who lost her son, Anthony Perez.\nOne woman in the crowd collapsed during the ceremony, apparently overcome by grief; bystanders helped her to her feet. But mostly, victims' relatives sent personal messages of enduring loss and remembrance to loved ones some had never even had the chance to know.\n\"Please know,\" Kristin Vanacore said to the memory of her brother, Edward Raymond Vanacore, \"that you and all of the other victims will never be forgotten.\"\nFILE- In this Sept. 11, 2014 file photo, visitors to the National September 11 Memorial take photos of and observe the Tribute in Light from the South Pool on the 13th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File) In Washington, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama stepped out of the White House at 8:46 a.m. — when the first plane hit the north tower — to observe a moment of silence. Later Friday, President Obama was scheduled to observe the anniversary with a visit to Fort Meade, Maryland, in recognition of the military's work to protect the country.\nThe Flight 93 National Memorial near Shanksville in western Pennsylvania was marking the completion of its $26 million visitor center, which opened to the public Thursday. At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Ash Carter and other officials were joining in remembrances for victims' relatives and Pentagon employees.\nSacramento, California, was commemorating 9/11 in conjunction with a parade honoring three friends who tackled a heavily armed gunman on a Paris-bound high-speed train last month.

The plaza was to open three hours earlier after the anniversary ceremony.\nIn Washington, some members of Congress planned to spend part of the anniversary discussing federal funding for the ground zero memorial. The House Natural Resources Committee has scheduled a hearing Friday on a proposal to provide up to $25 million a year for the plaza. The federal government contributed heavily to building the institution; leaders have tried unsuccessfully for years to get Washington to chip in for annual costs, as well.\nAn estimated 21 million people have visited the plaza for free since its 2011 opening. The museum, which charges up to $24 per ticket, has seen almost 3.6 million visitors since its May 2014 opening, topping projections by about 5 percent.\nFILE- In this Sept. 11, 2014 file photo, a visitor to the National September 11 memorial, pans his phone while shooting video of One World Trade Center and surrounding buildings on the 13th anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.

(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson, File) This year's anniversary also comes as advocates for 9/11 responders and survivors are pushing Congress to extend two federal programs that promised billions of dollars in compensation and medical care. Both programs are set to expire next year.\nArmy Sgt. Edwin Morales had those responders in mind as he attended the ground zero ceremony in remembrance of his cousin firefighter Ruben \"Dave\" Correa.\n\"People are still dying because of what happened,\" both on battlefields and from illnesses that some who responded to the attacks have developed after exposure to toxic dust, Morales said.\nPresident Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama, and others. pause on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Friday, Sept. 11, 2015, as they observe a moment of silence to mark the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
