It is the synchronized working of all these parts that enable it to fly and do all the required tasks. There are five basic structural components: fuselage, wings, empennage (tail structures), propulsion system and undercarriage. Let us briefly discuss the structure and purpose of each component. The fuselage is the body or main structure of an airplane which holds all other components together. It consists of the cockpit or flight deck, passenger compartment and cargo compartment. The cockpit contains seats for the occupants and also the controls of the Aircraft. The fuselage provides attachment points for other major airplane components. The fuselage has an aerofoil shape. Although wings produce most of the lift the fuselage also produces some lift. If the fuselage is bulky it may produce a lot of drag. Hence the fuselage has a streamline shape to decrease the drag. The fuselage has a sharp or rounded nose with tapered body. This enables air to flow smoothly around it. The wings are also aerofoil in shape and are attached to each side of the fuselage. They are the main lift producing bodies and support the aircraft in flight. In most aircrafts the design is such that the outer tips of wings are higher than the position where the wings are attached to the fuselage. This upward angle called dihedral angle prevents the aircraft from rolling during flight. Fuel for aircraft is also carried in the wings. There are numerous wing designs, and patterns used by various aircraft manufacturers. According to the position where wings are attached they are classified as high-wing, mid-wing and low-wing respectively. There are moving surfaces placed near the tip of wings called Ailerons. Its function is fairly simple to understand. By moving upwards or downwards it modifies the angle of attack of the wing which enables it to sink or lift. Ailerons are complimentary in the sense that if one moves the other will move in the opposite direction to the same extent. The rear part of the aircraft is the empennage (also called tail). It provides stability and control for the aircraft. Attached to the vertical stabilizer is the rudder. Attached to the horizontal stabilizers are the elevators. These stabilizers enable the aircraft to maintain its balance in wind. The rudder controls the Y - axis or Yaw of the plane and is controlled from the cockpit with the pedals. The elevators provide stability to aircraft in Z-axis. Its function is to control the pitch of the aircraft. Now let us take a look at propulsion systems of Aircrafts. In propeller driven aircrafts two or more blades are rotated about a central shaft which transmits power by converting it into thrust. A pressure difference between forward and rear surfaces of the airfoil shaped blades is produced through the application of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third Law resulting in generation of thrust. Common Four stroke cycle engines constitute piston engines. They use aviation gas, and their functioning is very similar to car engines. Jet Engines are aircraft engines with complex propulsion systems. Thrust is generated by compressing air and releasing it through a nozzle. The details pertaining to the power plant is quite complex and is beyond the scope of our present discussion. There are compressors, combustion chambers, turbines and exhaust nozzle. A Turboprop is a jet engine which drives a propeller. The advantage here is that we have a more reliable engine than a piston engine but not as complicated and big as a jet engine. Undercarriage is the wheels which enable the aircraft to land and take off. JetEXE is a global aircraft parts distributor dealing in genuine OEM aircraft parts of major manufacturers shipping parts to domestic and international customers. Hard to find parts that are available with other vendors are also listed. A good inventory of parts for varied aircrafts is maintained. They also have the right tools for the right job. JetEXE even provides tools on rent. They have a Pilot store managed by real pilots and you can get the best selection of Pilot supplies, accessories and gadgets.
