This system basically works in combination with the GIS, the utility's CIS, and IVR system. The system is specifically designed to reduce the financial impact of a power blackout. With the help of this system, power utilities are able to monitor and control the distribution network, thereby enhancing the quality of their services. It also helps in providing a real-time analysis of the operational condition of a power network and provides self-healing capabilities. Ultimately, the advanced distribution management system helps in the proper management of increasing energy consumption, surging energy cost, and power system network instability due to aging.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global advanced distribution management system market to grow at a CAGR of 17.1% over the period 2014-2019.\nCovered in this Report\nThe report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global advanced distribution management system market for the period 2015-2019.
