Why not play a part in it? At the end of this month, at the UN in New York, the world's leaders will agree a mammoth programme of sustainable development -agreeing how and what to do to make the world a better place o live in for everybody. Later this year at COP21 in Paris emissions goals will be agreed and next year at ICAO the world's airlines will agree their targets.This month 17 Sustainable Development goals will be agreed to be achieved by 2030 and, as part of these goals there are 169 specific targets.Four of these relate directly to tourism, but many of them can be achieved with the help of tourism as a powerful method for community development.This year it is said that the international travel and tourism industry will carry and host over a billion clients. Domestic tourism industries will host over four billion visitors.
