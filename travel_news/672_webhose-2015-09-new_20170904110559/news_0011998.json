For these aspects and more, the experienced OCR staff has set strict requirements which online gambling brands need to stand up to in order to receive the OCR Seal of Approval.\nReceiving the OCR Seal of Approval also entails the presence of at least 8 months on OCR with a review of at least four stars out of five. OCR conducts tri-monthly audits to the approved brands to make sure that they still meet the seal's requirements. Approved brands are presented in a designated section on OCR, featured on the site's main page, and their approved status is confirmed in their review page with a special Seal of Approval badge.\n\"Receiving the OCR Seal of Approval is of great importance to online gambling operators,\" said Oren Arz , Affiliate Relations Manager of OCR. \"Operators whose brands are approved earn the trust and certitude of players who are much more likely to sign-up with their brands when looking for a new place to play. The Seal of Approval initiative was developed with the needs of players in mind; nowadays players conduct meticulous research before signing up with an online gambling brand and we believe that the Seal of Approval can be of great help in that process, as well as serve as a healthy catalyst for operators to offer top products.\n\"Players look up and heed to OCR's advice, relying on over 15 years of experience in the online gambling industry. The OCR Seal of Approval guarantees to players that a brand is 100% trustworthy and of the highest entertainment qualities.\"\nOnline gambling operators interested in applying for the OCR Seal of Approval can email OCR at: http://www.onlinecasinoreports.com/contact-us.php .\nFor more information, visit http://www.onlinecasinoreports.com/seal-of-approval\nRelated Links:\nOnline Casino Reports Seal of Approval Requirements for Operators to Attain the Online Casino Reports Seal of Approval Online Casino Reports Homepage Contact Information:\nOren Arz\nAffiliate Relations Manager\nOnline Casino Reports\n7822110804\neditor@onlinecasinoreports.com\nThis release was issued through WebWire(R).
