Inside this building lies a wild place. Picture: Miacker Source: Flickr \nBY DAY you wouldn’t think much of this place. After all, from the outside it appears to be no more than a derelict powerhouse surrounded by a lonesome supermarket and uninspiring communist architecture. \nBut come the weekend and it’s another story. It transforms into a mecca for ravers, the holy grail of electronic beats, the motherland of unconformity and a haven where outlandish sexual fantasies come true. \nWelcome to Europe’s premier nightclub, the infamous Berghain of Berlin. \nDubbed the ‘world’s best club’ from the likes of The New York Times and The Rolling Stone , Berghain is notorious for its countless stories of drugs, X-rated sexual encounters and mind-blowing industrial techno, housing one of the most powerful sound systems in the world. \nIt could also be argued that the club is just as famous for its exceptionally ambiguous door policy, with people turned away by its gatekeepers without rhyme or reason. Even the famous aren’t immune, with Britney Spears reportedly rejected earlier this year due to her poor choice of footwear. Trying to get in to Berghain isn’t easy. Picture: Chris Schmid Source: Supplied \nAs a visitor to Berlin, I was immediately intrigued and knew I had to attempt to enter this three-level sanctum. But it wasn’t easy getting in to this place. \nEstablished in 2004, Berghain’s name draws upon its location between East Berlin’s most hip neighbourhoods Kreuzberg and Friedrichsain. Many make the pilgrimage to ‘Sunday Mass’ in the ‘church’ for its reputation of bestowing spiritual awakenings of the clubbing kind. \nFrom Friday night right through to Monday afternoon, this defunct concrete icon blares out hypnotic deep house with some people choosing not to see the light of day in this labyrinth club. \nKindly, mirrors are banned from the basic and grungy bathrooms to save face from the countless hours of partying, as well as discouraging vanity. It’s hard to get into. Picture: Robert Agthe Source: Flickr \nSurrounded by wire, the building is comprised of Berghain itself, Panorama Bar and the sex den Lab. Oratory is a for gay men only. They are asked to strip off and place their clothes in a bag in order to enter. And during Easter, the club hosts its famous Snax Club, a men-only fetish and sex party weekender. \nAnother major talking point of Berghain is the infamous ‘dark rooms’, where the most brazen of casual and random sexual encounters occur. \nIt’s not just the secrecy that surrounds the club and its lure to attract the world’s most respected DJs to play at one of Berlin’s most subversive attractions, but rather the fact it is arduous to pass through the bouncers. Few are able to get past these doors. Picture: Cara Courage Source: Flickr \nDoorman Sven Marquardt is just as legendary as Berghain itself. Heavily tattooed and pierced, he’s a minor celebrity in Berlin and the pioneer of fostering the ‘right mix’ of people to enter through the clubs’ doors. \nMany will queue for hours to enter, however once at the last hurdle, the bouncers will bestow a quick gaze and make the decision to let you through the realm of Berghian or to banish you from the premises. Berghain doorman, Sven Marquardt.

There’s even an app sourced by crowd funding information updating the status of the ever present and long queues. \nConsistent tips and advice on how to enter the club include not speaking in the queue (especially \nEnglish), putting your phone away and trying not to act like a tourist. Stilettos are out, black is in, minimalistic make up is preferred and please, leave the glitter at home. \nIf you do manage to get in, there’s zero tolerance to cameras and if you’re caught taking a selfie or trying to capture shenanigans around you — you will be thrown out. This is a place that you don’t want to mess with. The “derelict” building. Picture: James Dennes Source: Flickr \nMy experience with Berghain has been of both rejection and success. \nMy first (and failed) attempt was with my German friend whom like myself, was a Berghain first-timer. Upon leaving his apartment to make the freezing expedition to Berghain on a cold night, his housemate had informed us to strictly wear black. \nI decided to defy his advice and opted for high-waisted, tight magenta pants teamed with a black top and a half-caked face of make-up. My friend decided to keep it casual in black attire without looking anything special, basic at best. The colourful world inside. Picture: Bart Van Poll Source: Flickr \nIt was Saturday night at 12am when, fuelled by alcohol, we joined the manic queue. The atmosphere was quiet and sullen to say the least, with the majority of the crowd decked out in no-thrills black clothing as if it was some kind of cult. \nWe waited and drank from the local street vendors who took advantage of the lines of thirsty and keen revellers. We befriended some tourists who were clearly high on life and thought it was a good idea to dose themselves in glitter and make light of the long wait. Waiting in the line. Picture: Tim Lucas Source: Flickr \nAfter two hours of waiting, I let them shower me with glitter and had a bit of a laugh in line. Rookie error. \nFinally making it to the start of the line, I had the honour (or should I say displeasure) of Marquardt giving me a millisecond of a glance and giving me a quick ‘nein’. Tonight wasn’t the night to grace Berghain with my presence, or perhaps it didn’t want a piece of me at all, ever. You’re not meant to take photos. Source: Flickr \nHow foolish I was to make a second attempt at entering Berghain only to be met with the same fate an hour-and-a-half later, more intoxicated and covered in even more glitter. Understandably, I got a flat out rejection. \nOf course the first question that sprung to mind when rejected was; “What’s wrong with me?” and I was miffed. The dream of Berghain was over. My friend and I, like many others, decided to make the trip to Watergate, another popular late night venue. The mark of success. Picture: Mike Burns Source: Flickr \nHowever, a few months later I decided to make a third attempt, and was more determined to succeed than ever before. I had learned from my other failed attempts and had listened to the advice from other successful Berghain-goers. \nThis time, I dressed to fit in. I opted for black on black, styling down and wearing sneakers. I also decided to go solo as from what I had been told, solo is the best way to go in a club that offers so much and is consistently overcrowded. Stairway to sexual fantasies coming true. Bart Van Poll Source: Flickr \nI joined the queue at 2am and half-an-hour later, I came face-to-face with the bouncers who eyed me and muttered something in German. Would I get in or would I get my third rejection? \nI was nervous but tried to keep my cool at the same time, I wanted to reach the pinnacle of clubbing life. In the end, the bouncers were in my favour and I got my first ‘ja’! \nIt was a very intimidating process to pass the bouncers. But once in the club, it was like a circus of human activity. \nRoom by room, floor by floor, I witnessed elaborate make-out sessions in the corners, and rough but frenzied kissing by the bar. The pashers were oblivious to the drinks being brought around them. Photos aren’t meant to be taken. Picture: Cypunk Source: Flickr \nHeading out of the bar, I stopped short to really get a sense of where I was. \nThe main floor was packed like a sardine can. Standing on the balcony that overlooks the main dancefloor, I watched people raving in their own bubble of trance in a carefree state of mind. Other revellers walked around looking completely out of it. \nIn an institution as subversive as this, it’s very common for revellers to be under the influence of various party drugs. \nI decided to spend the rest of the night joining the masses of sweaty bodies on the main dancefloor, dancing by myself and with the odd new friend of the night. There was no need for talking, you couldn’t even if you wanted to because the music continuously thumps away. Partying away. Picture: Thomas Angermann Source: Flickr \nFour hours later, I stumbled out of Berghain, knowing that all the raving, the random encounters and the blaring of deep house would continue on right through to Monday morning. The things I saw will never be unseen. And as I passed the queue that snaked its way around the premises at the wee hours of the morning, I wished them all luck with the bouncers. \nThe long enduring wait, the judgments at the door, in the end it’s all worth it. And more. \nRead more about Julia’s adventures at her blog TheRoamingFlamingo.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:13:49.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
