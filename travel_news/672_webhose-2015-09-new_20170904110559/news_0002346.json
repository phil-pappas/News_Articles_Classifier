Join the Canadian East Coast Wildlife Expedition \nThe very smart and savvy Cape Breton entrepreneur, Andrew Prossin, started One Ocean Expeditions as a way to bring attention to the Canadian Maritimes. Through his initiative he is raising the profile of the region and presenting its beauty as well as its challenges to a global audience. \nThere is no doubt that One Ocean passengers will be delighted with their Maritime experience. Whatever their choice of activities (i.e., kayaking, stand-up paddle boarding, biking, birding, shopping) the experience is definitely going to be fun, memorable and safe. \nBeyond a Holiday \nIt should be noted, however, that making a reservation and visiting the region has a far greater impact than just a perfect way to spend a holiday and get terrific pictures of puffins for uploading to your Facebook page. \nThe Canadian Maritimes have been losing population over the last few years and John Ibbitson of the Globe and Mail highlighted the problem in his story of March 20, 2015, “How the Maritimes became Canada’s incredible shrinking region.” He points out that in addition to a declining population, there is a lack of immigrants, a weakening economy, and those remaining do not want to acknowledge that with fewer workers to pay taxes and an aging population in need of government services, the future for local citizens is not optimistic. While the people living in the Maritimes are reluctant to change, the area also, “….lacks the energy, entrepreneurial spirit and the desire for a fresh start that new Canadians bring,” according to Professor Peter McKenna, head of political science at the University of Prince Edward Island. \nAs a successful entrepreneur born in the region Prossin has brought his business acumen, ocean savvy and tourism expertise to a part of the world that is desperate for new economic development. \nGet Ready to Explore: Ecotourism at its Best \nThe Canadian East Coast expedition starts in Louisbourg where 96 passengers get into cold weather gear (including waterproof boots), scramble over a rock-covered beach (outside the walls of Fortress Louisbourg) and step into rubber motorized Zodiacs for a short ferry ride to the Russian ship Akademik Ioffe that will be “base camp” for the next 9 nights and 10 days. (Reminded me of WW11 military movies showing beach invasions). \nThanks to a very professional and supportive crew, the journey is made without incident and passengers and luggage cross the Atlantic and climb up the ladder to the ship where water and weather-proof paraphernalia is left in the wet room and guests are escorted to the main reception area where cabin assignments are presented. My cabin is small but sufficient; in reality, very little time is spent inside - so a luxurious suite is a waste of space. \nOnce settled it is time for an introduction to the lifeboats used should we need to abandon the ship in the case of an emergency. These “dinghies” are very tiny and hard to get in and out. My prayers are that the Russian Captain and the Canadian business executive in charge of us - know exactly what they are doing, so I do not have to exercise my newly learned skills on “how to evacuate a sinking ship.” \nThe day ends with drinks and dinner and promises of lots of things to see and do and hopes for good weather. The ship leaves Louisbourg, passes a light house and heads through the North Atlantic to the Outer Banks. \n• Day 2. Sable Island \nThis 13 mile sandbar, covered randomly with 17 species of plants and marram grass, is located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean approximately 190 miles southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It has fascinated scientists and tourists - forever. \nThe Island is home to less than 6 year-round Parks employees and researchers, 400 feral horses and the largest gray seal colonies in the region. It is also a stop-over for migratory birds who are transiting from/ to the High Artic region. The Island became Canada’s 43rd National Park on June 20, 2013 with the approval of the Mi’kmaq stakeholders. \nThe Akademik Ioffe drops anchor offshore and we get into our ocean – going gear of pants and jacket, boots and life vests, herded onto the deck where, single file we are ticked off the passenger list and slowly trundle down the ladder to the waiting Zodiacs. \nFear of heights or cold rough ocean seas is not an option. The competent crew deals efficiently with the most recalcitrant passengers and within moments the Zodiacs are full and navigated to the sandy beach. One by one we are off loaded from the Zodiacs into the surf and encouraged to quickly scramble onto the beach, get rid of the heavy gear, put on beach walking shoes, heave backpacks into a comfortable position and follow the guides to view the wild ponies. We are also reminded not to collect rocks, shells or any plants and to leave nothing behind – not a tissue, not a crumb and definitely no water bottles. \nIt is remarkable that all this activity is run so well: 96 people with ages ranging from a few months to over 90 – are - within minutes- hiking over the sand dunes to explore the Island. With greater appreciation for Lawrence of Arabia – there is finally a horse sighting. Cameras are positioned, voices are hushed, and the awesome picture of the ponies standing by a stream – look as if scheduled by Disney. \nIt is definitely hard to believe that these horses are able to survive without any human intervention. There is ongoing debate on whether Parks should intervene in the life of the animals – providing additional food or perhaps the services of a veterinarian. At this point it is “hands off.” \nAfter a trudge back to the Zodiacs and a return to the “mother ship,” we clean the sand from just about everything and get ready for additional activities or relax with a book and a drink, dinner and conversation. \n• Day 3. Bird Island \nWhile best viewed from the water via kayaks and stand-up paddle boards, the charm of the local community can be experienced by biking and walking along the quiet roads. \nMake a stop at the Englishtown grave yard and at its center look for the headstone of the Cape Breton Giant, Angus MacAskill (Scottish born, Canadian giant) who died in 1863. At 7’9” tall and weighing approximately 425 pounds this Cape Breton celebrity toured with the PT Barnum circus for many years. Frequently he was featured with Tom Thumb who danced on the palm of the “giants” right hand. Another interesting stop is the Englishtown Ferry (1977). The Torquil MacLean connects cars and trucks with Englishtown and Jersey Cove. \n• Day 4. The Magdalen Islands (Les Iles-de-la-Madeleine) \nThis archipelago forms part of the Canadian province of Quebec and is located in the middle of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Originally populated with the Mi’Kmaqs who used the location for hunting walrus, today it is popular with summer tourists interested in sea kayaking, wind and kitesurfing and winter visitors eager to observe new-born and young harp seal pups. \nA shopping highlight is the Fumoir d’Antan smokehouse where the smoked herring industry is still cherished. For three generation the Arseneau family prepares and sells plain and marinated herring fillets, smoked mackerel, salmon and scallops.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T07:55:51.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
