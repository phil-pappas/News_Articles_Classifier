As it approaches its 100th anniversary on Wednesday, we take a look at what it offers modern women . Campaigning Today their suffragette past has evolved to campaigning on modernday issues such as human trafficking, mental health and even bees. In recent years, they have called for an end to the inappropriate detention of people with mental health problems, their actions were partially behind a funded Government pilot focused on tackling the issue. The WI has argued for concessions on the cuts to legal aid, raising particular concerns over the impact on victims of domestic violence. Their campaigns have helped secure £10 million in research funding for bee diseases as well as a Government commitment to developing an action plan for bees. Pub meet-ups The east London branch Dalston Darlings meet up regularly for red wine and chips at the Duke of Wellington pub. With members ranging from their early 20s to early 60s, the Darlings certainly represent the organisation's modern face. They're not alone - several members of other branches told how their WI friendship groups often meet up frequently for a drink or two. Queen Elizabeth II glancing at barrels of beer and crates of empty beer bottles piled high outside Sandringham Club as she and the Queen Mother arrived to attend a meeting of Sandringham Women's Institute New skills: from beekeeping to bunting Yes, baking is one of them. But there are also chances to learn how to organise events and how to keep bees as well as craft sessions on paper cutting and making bunting. Sarah Plant joined her local WI in Manchester when she was 28. The group meet once a month in the city centre, but she says \"it has a bit of a village feel to it and everyone is very friendly and welcoming. \"I try to go to all of the meetings as the programme is so varied, I don’t want to miss anything. I think because we cover a range of topics it appeals to women of all ages, It’s not all cakes and crafts, which I think sometimes puts people off. You certainly don’t need to bake cakes or be fantastic with a crochet hook or sewing machine. The mixture of ages in the group gives a diverse mix of abilities, knowledge and experience. Without this mix it wouldn’t be the fantastic community it has grown to be.\" Despite being a member for four years, she said she still gets funny looks from her friends when she says she's going to a WI meeting. She says: \"I joined because I wanted to meet new people and learn new things and it has certainly changed my life in terms of the opportunities I have been involved in and the skills I have learnt. Ultimately, the WI offers something for everyone, no matter what your age.\" The writer and journalist India Knight Interesting speakers What's on offer varies from branch to branch but most, if not all, offer monthly talks from a variety of speakers. Louise Checkley from N1WI in London said high-profile media figures such as Robert Peston, Evan Davies and India Knight had all come to present to them. • The WI: 100 years in pictures New friends Rebecca Coughlan, a costumed designer, grew up in Manchester but struggled to make new friends when she returned years later. The 28-year-old was intrigued when she found a WI in the city aimed at younger women so she joined up. But, she says, \"the group was huge so I still didn’t make any new friends until I met Katie our president and she asked me if I’d help her to set up a new WI\". Their new branch opened in January and Rebecca says she has met a lot of new people as a result. \"Getting together after a hectic day at work is the highlight of my monthly social calendar much to my husband’s confusion,\" she says. \"Our WI is called Cottonopolis WI - after the Victorian nickname for the area - and I think our average age is between 25-35\". Louise Checkley also struggled to meet people outside of work when she moved to London. A colleague suggested she join the WI as a joke, but she says after looking into it, \"it didn't seem that bad\". In one session a geneologist taught them how to trace their family tree, and in another she learnt to make and taste cocktails. \"The group's age ranges from the early 20s to early 60s, eventually you build up a friendship,\" she says. \"There's a group of us that meet up (outside monthly WI meetings) and we've even gone camping. \"People think it's old ladies sipping tea but we've got a range of lawyers, architects, coders and nurses\". I hope you all have a great WI day on Wednesday, don't forget to join in with #iamwi to celebrate #theWI_100years pic.twitter.com/x1PNQIfxkC — Women of the WI (@WomenoftheWI) September 13, 2015 Film and book clubs Annabelle Gowen, 32, joined a branch this year where around half are under 35. Annabelle started her branch's camera club to share their photography and help with each other's projects. \"The WI has a long tradtion of educating women and I wanted to add to that,\" she says. \"I normally describe it as ‘brownies for grown ups’. It is very social and a great way to meet lots of new people. There is always something to do, something to learn and cake to eat. Just because you are under 30 doesn’t mean you don’t love baking or want to hear about a new subject. I personally hate baking, it is too stressful but I am happy to eat the cake provided by other members.\" \"Our Wi is based in the city centre, so it has been very popular with younger women as they live or work in the area.\" • The Queen is \"just one of us\" at her local Women’s Institute Photo: Full Stop Wine tasting Katie Pegum, is president of Cottonopolis WI at just 29. She says she joined for \"new friends, traditional interest and a fab social group\". She says they have had a whole host of activities as well as trips away and museum visits. \"It's a great way to do a variety of different activities with lots of different women. We are a very diverse group with about a third under 35,\" she says. Rebecca Coughlan explains that various sub-groups that meet regularly include a camera club, a film club, a book group and their new booze club which kicks off this month with a wine tasting session. Recent meetups have also included a clothes swap shop, a bee keeping talk, chocolate tasting and a Manchester history walk. \"I love telling people that I’m in the WI then explaining to them what it’s really like when they inevitably look at me like I’ve gone mad,\" she says. \"Of course, there are groups that are more ‘stereotypical WI’ but there are so many springing up for younger women, who like me just want to meet like-minded women in a relaxed environment, hear interesting talks and learn new skills.\" Social group for students Sarah Plant says: \"If you are at university in a different place it can offer a friendly group of women who will look after you and make you feel welcome. Apart from the meetings there are usually opportunities to join the committee or run a subgroup. \"These are fantastic opportunities for young women to get involved in - it gives you invaluable skills for later on in life. I would encourage them to go to a meeting and see what they’re missing\". • Anyone for boiled cake? 100 years of cooking with the WI Community Janice Langley, the chair of the national federation, thinks the organisation provides a sense of community in the digital age. She says: “The WI was originally set up to provide educational opportunities for women, but to also bring women together and provide a space for them to learn and make friends – to build community. \"In today’s age with so much activity now taking place online, the WI continues to provide this sense of community and the chance to learn new skills and meet new people, exactly as it did 100 years ago. “Anecdotally everyone has stories of members meeting their neighbours for the first time in a WI meeting when they’d lived in the same area for 10 years, but the space and security that WI meetings provide – a place for women to come together and learn and share – remains as important, if not more important, as it was in 1915.” The WI: a century in pictures The WI has survived two world wars and a century of social change.
