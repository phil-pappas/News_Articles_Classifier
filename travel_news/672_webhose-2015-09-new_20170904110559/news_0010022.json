Ideal for conferences, awards dinners, networking events, weddings and private parties, The Bays area features two adjoining spaces. \nGuests attending events in The Bays will arrive into Bay 1, the large 200-capacity pre-function room with an open plan kitchen and a large feature bar, before moving through two sets of double doors into the main event space, Bay 2. Bay 2, which has capacity for 360 guests reception-style, 200 for a dinner and 310 in theatre-style seating, features a full AV package including screens and projectors, colour-changing down lighters on all the pillars, a PA system, and appropriate furniture. Described as a ‘plug and play’ space, the space is ideal for clients looking for a hassle-free event solution that can be adapted in whichever way is required. James Cohen, owner of Victoria Warehouse, says: “We are pleased that phase one of our expansion project has been completed and that The Bays is now available for hire. We have already seen significant interest in the new space and have already confirmed events including the Independent Venue Show in October, a conference and 20th anniversary celebration for full service digital marketing, technology and commerce consultancy, Amaze, and Cup North, a two day Northern coffee party. “The next phase of our expansion will see the basement events space completed in late 2016 and the addition of 400 new bedrooms to our onsite hotel to be fully completed by 2017. Ultimately, we hope the expansion will make Victoria Warehouse a one stop shop for the events industry, with a range of event spaces on offer to suit different client needs and budgets.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T13:39:20.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
