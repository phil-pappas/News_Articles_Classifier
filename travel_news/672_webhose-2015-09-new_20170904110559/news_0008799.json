Although it hasn’t been determined whether the property will be razed by implosion or manual demolition, a six-month time frame has been recommended to complete the task.\nBut don’t expect much more in the short term. Reports indicate that the space is unlikely to be fully redeveloped for at least two years, while funds are secured to finance the entire $2.3 billion upgrade and expansion for what is being renamed the Las Vegas Convention Center District. (The convention center will be extended all the way out to the Strip.)\nIn the meantime, the former resort’s footprint will be paved and used as an overspill space for outdoor events and conventions.\nOff-the-menu deal: The famous off-the-menu steak dinner at the downtown California’s Redwood Bar and Grill is one of the longest-running deals in town. The 18-ounce porterhouse that comes with soup or salad, potato, vegetable, bread and hot apple-dumpling dessert debuted in the mid-1980s. Of course, the price has gone since then. Originally $6.95, it’s now $24.95, but still a bargain.\nAZCENTRAL\nLas Vegas: 20,000-seat arena rising at New York-New York\nShow switch: “Jabbawockeez” has closed at Luxor to make way for the Blue Man Group, which will end its run at Monte Carlo in October. “Jabbawockeez” will reopen at MGM Grand in October and Blue Man will reopen at Luxor in November.\nBackstage tour: Complimentary backstage tours of “KA” at MGM Grand are being offered at 11 and 11:30 a.m. Tuesdays. All ages are welcome and no reservation is required for the 20- to 30-minute experience.\nLas Vegas Club sold, closed: Downtown’s Las Vegas Club recently was sold to the owners of Golden Gate and the D and then closed. The new owners bought the land and the building, but not the gaming business or the casino name, and are assessing their options. The 86-year-old resort had been on the decline in recent years, closing its 400-room hotel and then its restaurants. It’s expected that the casino will be renovated and reopened under a new name, although no plans have been announced.\nPlaza perk: One beneficiary of the Las Vegas Club sale should be the neighboring Plaza, whose owners were the sellers of the Las Vegas Club and can now concentrate on their primary property. Several new promotions are reportedly in the works at the Plaza, including the new “$500 on Us” program, which allows players to get a rebate of up to $500 in gambling losses incurred within the first 24 hours of joining the players club.\nNo Wahlburgers: The Wahlburgers hamburger chain will not be coming to Las Vegas anytime soon. The first of multiple Las Vegas locations had been announced for the Grand Bazaar shopping area at Bally’s, but that deal has been scuttled.\nQuestion: Is Celine Dion back at Caesars Palace?\nAnswer: Dion’s first concert after a long hiatus was last week. Going into this run, Celine had played 913 shows at the Colosseum to nearly 4 million fans.\nQ: With football season around the corner, can you tell us who the favorites are for college and the pros?\nA: The numbers vary from book to book, but following odds are representative. The preseason favorite to win the NCAA National Championship is Ohio State at 3-1, followed by Alabama and TCU, both at 8-1. The Super Bowl favorites are the Seahawks at 4-1, followed by the Packers at 6-1 and the Patriots and Colts at 9-1. The long shots are the Jaguars and Titans at 250-1.\nFor information about shows, buffets, coupons and deals, go to www.LasVegasAdvisor.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3167f5664469afad233fa579622e39e303e8e2dc/c=301-0-1759-1458/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/12/01/635530347625029648-494240367.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-04T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T18:34:26.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
