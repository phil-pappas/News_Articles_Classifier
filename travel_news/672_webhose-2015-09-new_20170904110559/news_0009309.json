This is the temporary injunction against the pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit, ordering Lufthansa pilots to halt their strike. The walkout is the 13th amid a pay dispute. \nThe state labor court in the German city of Frankfurt issued the injunction on Wednesday in response to a request by Lufthansa, which had earlier failed to stop the strike through the courts. \nThe court called the strike \"unlawful,\" saying it was not directed at achieving a concrete goal with regard to wages, but rather against Lufthansa's plans to expand its budget airline subsidiaries. \nThe decision by the state court overturned an earlier verdict by the Frankfurt state court, which on Tuesday evening had declined Lufthansa's request for an injunction. \nLufthansa subsidiary Germanwings has placed a similar request at a labor court in Cologne, which also declined to issue an injunction. The higher state labor court of North Rhine-Westphalia is reconsidering an appeal, but has yet to announce its decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:02:27.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
