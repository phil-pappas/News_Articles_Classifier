Supplied \nThe Kingston Flyer sits unused in Kingston. \n\"It's the last chance. If it's up for grabs it will be removed.\" \nThe Kingston Flyer sits unused in Kingston. \nBarkley urged supporters to contact the council before October 24, to have the rolling stock added back onto the heritage register, when submissions on the district plan closed. \n\"Stop the stupidity of taking it off the heritage register,\" Barkley said. \nThe council should buy it, set it aside and find investors, he said. \n\"There are people out there interested but we've got to get that ownership,\" he said. \nHe believed an investment of $5 million or more would be needed to get it running again. \nREAD MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:36:16.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
