However, slots are limited, and registration will close on Nov. 14. The event is a family-friendly, 3.1 mile walk/run to benefit the Allegheny County Airport Authority Charitable Foundation, a nonprofit organization established in 2014 to assist members of the military, families and others traveling through Pittsburgh International and Allegheny County Airport.\nThe race route will take participants along the grounds and taxiways and near hangars and aircraft at the county airport, which was dedicated on Sept. 11, 1931. Airport Authority CEO Christina Cassotis said this inaugural airport 5K is part of a renewed effort to share the facilities of AGC with the community and highlight the airport’s importance to business and executive travelers in the region.\n“The county airport supports more than 60,000 business and corporate-related operations per year,” Cassotis said. “Many of the area’s largest corporations base their aircraft here including PPG, PNC, Alcoa and Stat Medevac. It is truly Pittsburgh’s executive airport.”\nAGC is the site of some of the first flights that delivered U.S. mail in the 1930s, and is also the long-time home of Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics and Pittsburgh Flight Training Center, two important aviation training centers. The facility also includes two full-service, fixed-base operators, Corporate Air and Voyager Jet, a 6,500-foot runway, one helipad, a 24-hour FAA control tower and rental car facilities.\n“We understand how much the history of Allegheny County Airport has meant in our community, and we are excited about additional partnerships and possibilities for the future,” Cassotis said.\nSource:- FlyPittisburgh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:04:15.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
