He said the terminal by the ticketing counter was shut down for about two hours, and that people in the terminal went outside for about 20 minutes.\nLe said the bomb robot took the bag to an employee parking lot, examined it, and determined it posed no threat. He said it's unclear who the bag belonged to.\nHe said there was a short delay for departing flights, but incoming flights weren't affected. The terminal reopened around 1 p.m. Sunday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T01:08:10.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
