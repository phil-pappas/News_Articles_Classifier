Flexjet is finalizing the development of the Flexjet-exclusive LXi artisan interiors for the Legacy 450, with deliveries of the aircraft beginning in 2016. \nThe Legacy 450 is an incomparable choice for owners of older aircraft such as the Cessna Citation Excel/XLS. In terms of size, the Legacy 450 will fit squarely in the center of Flexjet’s fleet: The niche between the super light Learjet 75LXi and the super midsized Challenger 350. Further increasing the aircraft’s appeal, it will be offered as part of Flexjet’s premium LXi Cabin Collection, with the finest luxury interiors. \nFlexjet Chief Executive Officer Michael Silvestro said, “We know that current and prospective Owners are seeking cabins that are larger and more luxurious than those typically found in this category, complemented by the newest technology and optimized performance. We are thrilled to bring the innovative Legacy midsized cabin solution to the market starting this month.” \nThe Legacy 450 includes features never before seen in midsized aircraft, such as marble floor entryways and a seven-layer sound wall that will make the cabin extremely quiet and lessen passenger fatigue. Flexjet designers have worked tirelessly on the development of exclusive artisan interiors for the Legacy 450 that will be unique to Flexjet, as they have with the entire LXi collection. \nThe Legacy 450 will have digital flight controls based on Fly-By-Wire technology and be powered by a pair of Honeywell HTF7500E engines, the most environmentally friendly in their class. With the ability to take off from airfields as short as 3,825 feet, the Legacy 450 can fly at altitudes as high as 45,000 feet and will have a range of approximately 2,600 nautical miles with four passengers, including NBAA IFR fuel reserves. \nAt six feet tall and six feet, 10 inches wide, the cabin of the Legacy 450 is the largest in its class and features a baggage capacity 20 percent larger than that of its closest competitor. The Flexjet edition of the Legacy 450 offers a best-in-class, flat-floor cabin and features seating for eight passengers. In addition, the fully reclining club seats may be converted into a lie-flat bed for complete rest, as needed. \nThe Embraer midsized aircraft will join Flexjet’s LXi Cabin Collection, which also includes the Learjet 75, the Challenger 350, the Global Express and Gulfstream’s G450, G500 and G650. \nFlexjet also has announced that it is accelerating deliveries of the Gulfstream G450 business jet in response to heavy market demand for long-range international travel. This accelerated delivery schedule is part of an order placed for up to 50 new aircraft from Gulfstream’s iconic line of business jets which includes the G450, G500 and G650.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:40:31.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
