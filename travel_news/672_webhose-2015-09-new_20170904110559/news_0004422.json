(NASDAQ: BCOV), the leading provider of cloud services for video, today announced Brightcove Jump Start for Apple TV®, a new service offering to enable publishers to quickly launch video apps on the fourth-generation Apple TV®. For a limited time, starting at $10,000 USD, the new Jump Start offering builds on Brightcove's existing expertise and history of delivering and monetizing a range of beautiful video experiences on the Apple TV® platform and across the Apple® ecosystem. Jump starting content on the fourth-generation Apple TV ®The new Brightcove Jump Start for Apple TV® offers publishers a solution to quickly build and go-to-market with a rich consumer video experience on Apple TV®. Jump Start connects the industry-leading Video Cloud platform with the new Apple TV® and features: Creation of a living room video experience optimized for Apple TV® and customized to the content owner's brand. Access to Brightcove's world-class consulting team to advise on Apple TV® and Brightcove technology strategy, best practices, and design, drawn from expertise in powering marketing-leading Apple TV® experiences. Video experience powered by Video Cloud's industry-leading video services for content management, high-performance playback, and analytics. Deep Apple TV ® platform experience Brightcove provides deep expertise creating compelling video experiences on Apple TV® and offers publishers, broadcasters, and content owners multiple paths to bring their content to Apple TV® to support a range of different business models. In addition to the Jump Start service, Brightcove's existing Apple TV® capabilities include: DRM protection of premium content - Brightcove is one of only six companies approved by Apple to deliver content using their FairPlay® Streaming (FPS) digital rights management (DRM) format. Brightcove also enables delivery of non-DRM or \"clear\" content to Apple TV® through Video Cloud, the company's flagship online video platform service, and through Once, the company's industry-leading server-side ad insertion service. TV-like ad-supported user experience - Brightcove enables content owners to monetize premium content through server-side insertion of pre-roll, mid-roll, or post-roll ads via Brightcove Once. By stitching ads into video content in the cloud, Brightcove delivers seamless, high performance playback of ad-supported content to end users. AirPlay ® support for video - For media publishers who do not have Apple® approved apps on the Apple TV®, Brightcove enables them to use Apple AirPlay® to wirelessly stream content from their iOS device to the Apple TV®. Brightcove Video Cloud transcodes content for playback on iOS devices that may be streamed over AirPlay® to enable the mobile-to-Apple TV® experience. For content owners already on Apple TV®, AirPlay® support allows them to maximize the Apple® device ecosystem. Powerful iOS SDK - Deployed by leading publishers around the world, the Brightcove iOS SDK enables developers to quickly create video experiences on iOS devices. With the release of the new Apple TV® and tvOS (based on iOS), Brightcove will update the Brightcove iOS SDK as the new hardware and operating system becomes available for development. Modular online video services - Brightcove enables delivery to Apple TV® with Video Cloud, the industry's leading cloud service for video ingest, publishing, playback, content management, and analytics, Brightcove Once, server-side ad insertion product, and Zencoder, the industry's leading cloud-transcoding service.
