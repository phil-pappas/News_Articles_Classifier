Guests were welcomed with Prosecco on arrival and a selection of signature cocktails were served throughout the evening to showcase the head mixologist’s take on the classic Manhattan, Whiskey Sour and Tom Collins. The evening’s canapés, including mac & cheese, salted cod and Brooklyn crab salad, offered guests a taste of NY-LON’s menu, which pays homage to favourite British and American dishes. Tim Mapes, Delta’s Senior Vice President of Marketing comments: “Delta and Virgin constantly strive to find new ways to serve our customers. NY-LON is just one example of our joint commitment to innovation that meets our guests’ needs in the air and on the ground.” Reuben Arnold, Senior Vice President of Marketing & Customer Experience at Virgin Atlantic adds: “It’s a fantastic space to meet friends pre- and post-concert, pop by for an afternoon coffee or even grab an after work bite to eat. More than anything, NY-LON offers a taste of the style and incredible experience you can look forward to when you fly Virgin Atlantic or Delta.” The NY-LON lounge will be open seven days a week offering a luxurious bar with a difference. Operations behind the bar are run by Levy Restaurants UK, the sports, leisure and hospitality division of Compass Group UK & Ireland.
