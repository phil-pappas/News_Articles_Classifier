You are going to hear all kinds of noise, but when it boils down to it, if there was $80 billion of new money flowing into the market every month, this market would not be under pressure.\nInstead, not only has stimulus been removed, but cash — margin debt is at an all-time low — and if you add in the findings of our macroeconomic tool, The Investment Rate, what you get is a liquidity crisis. In other words, a lack of demand and an unwillingness to take on new risk.\nWhat do we do about it?\nFirst, keep your head on straight. You may own some darn good companies. They may be leaders in their market. Management may be great, and amazing new products might be expected. They may say all the right things when they announce earnings or issue press releases, and every analyst that follows them may have a buy rating on the company, but the stock price could still fall. You want a few examples? How about General Electric GE, -1.28% Honeywell HON, -2.33% IBM IBM, -1.55% Microsoft MSFT, -1.06% Cisco CSCO, -1.68% and Apple AAPL, -2.01% ?\nIt's not about being a good company or a bad one when it comes to the risks that exist today; it's about a willingness to assume risk, and to pay up going forward. (The current P/E multiple on the S&P is somewhere near 18 times, sky high in my opinion.) When risk perceptions change, the willingness of Wall Street to assume additional risk diminishes as well, in a big way. So what changes risk perceptions?\nNew Investors may say that it's China, an indecisive FOMC, or some other current event that might be the “reason of the day” from time to time, but the real reason investors lose their appetite for assuming additional risk is liquidity, which also means demand.\nHowever, this also works on both sides of the fence. When liquidity is flowing, when the tap is on so to speak, Wall Street is willing to assume great deals of risk.\nTake a look at our analysis of the Dow Jones Industrial Average fair value, and pay particular attention to the DJIA Yearly Growth Rate chart. Look at what was happening to the growth rate of the DJIA leading up to the FOMC stimulus policy in late 2012. The growth in earnings per share (EPS) was falling like a rock, and the deteriorating growth rate was a concern, just like it is now, but there's a material difference between then and now. That's liquidity.\nIn late 2012, Wall Street started to assume additional risk, and it did it in the face of declining growth, but not because they expected great growth going forward, but instead because they expected great liquidity (demand) given what the FOMC was starting to do. Some might even argue that they expected additional economic activity given the induced Wealth Effect that would probably accompany the trillions of dollars set to be infused into the system.\nLooking back at the DJIA yearly growth rate chart, we can see that EPS growth is again deteriorating. In fact, it is expected to turn negative for calendar 2015 when all the numbers are out, and it has already been negative in the second quarter of this year. We had declines back in 2012 and 2013 too, but the market increased in the face of them. That was because of excess liquidity, something we do not have today, and that puts Wall Street's appetite for risk today on the chopping block.\nNot only that, but institutional investors have less cash vs. margin than they have ever had in history, suggesting that they cannot pick up the pieces like they have tried to do after every setback leading up to the recent weakness. The recent market fall was more than it has in years, and a lack of demand is the reason.\nThe identification of lower liquidity levels makes institutional investors concerned, because ultimately that's all that matters. A good company will probably still be a good company if the market crashes, but stock prices may still fall. It's not about being good or bad, it's about risk perception and the willingness to pay up and assume risk.\nFor example, multiples can fall from 18 times to 12 times without making a company turn from good to bad.\nIn today's environment, risk perceptions have changed, liquidity is not what it was, and reality is starting to hit as the economy begins a retracement to the natural condition defined by The Investment Rate. Many could consider it a domino effect of sorts, but it would never even happen if Trillions were still flowing into the economy, fabricating liquidity, and creating an unnatural demand. If you want to know where natural demand levels are, The Investment Rate tells you.\nOn Saturday I will host a Webinar explaining this in detail.
