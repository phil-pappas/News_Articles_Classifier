Geogrids are used primarily for reinforcement applications such as in road, and railway industry. They are generally used in retaining walls as well as in bases, and sub-soils under any structure or roads for strengthening purposes. If compared with soil, geogrids have a higher tension bearing property which allows them to transfer load to a large area of soil. Geogrids are designed to solve some toughest construction challenges, stabilization of soft soils, reinforcement of steepened slopes increasing right of way without taking more land, and walls to construct temporary structures to facilitate the construction process.\nAsia-Pacific region dominated the global geogrids market size in terms of value in 2014 with around 35% share in the global market. Asia-Pacific is projected to have the highest market size in terms of value as well as volume by 2020, followed by the North America region. Asia-Pacific is also projected to be the fastest growing market, at a CAGR of around 17.0% from 2015 to 2020, owing to rise in consumption in the region, where end-user markets of geogrids is growing steadily, especially in road and rail infrastructural developments.\nThis study estimates the market size in terms of value and volume for geogrids and projects the same by 2020.
