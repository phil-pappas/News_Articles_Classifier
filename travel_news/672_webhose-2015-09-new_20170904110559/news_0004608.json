Launched in partnership with [entity display=\"Intel\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"intel\" ticker=\"INTC\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/2207\"]Intel[/entity], and accordingly hosting the button-sized Intel Curie chip, it is made from 3-D printed panels and an adaptable carbon fiber framework.“By using sensors and an innovative shape memory alloy, the responsive garments reflect a concept known as biomimicry, where nature is used to solve complex human problems,” wrote Ayse Ildeniz, VP of the New Devices Group at Intel, in a blogpost. What that translates to is a sleek silhouette accompanied by a winged-like structure behind it, which is the part that does the reacting.[caption id=\"attachment_457\" align=\"\" width=\"1200\"] Chromat Adrenaline Dress in partnership with Intel[/caption]The movement is thus not overly integrated into the garment itself at this stage, nor is it particularly suggestive of everyday wear (it's frankly not very \"wearable\"), but the Adrenaline Dress as it’s called is a prototype and not about to hit the market. Why it's relevant is in the fact it nods towards a future built around intelligent clothing that adjusts based on human whim. Fancy longer sleeves now the cooler weather is coming in? Yes please. How about a shorter skirt length to take you from the office to the bar? Why not. Exploring the molecular structure of fabric is a big leap forward expected to follow from wearables labs.Where further applicable utility was seen from Chromat’s show this season was in its second Intel piece, the Aeros Sports Bra. Inspired by wind, air and flight, this similarly leverages shape memory alloy to open vents when it senses changes in perspiration, respiration and body temperature, allowing the user to cool down or warm up accordingly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-15T20:03:27.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
