This report has been segregated based on systems, applications, and territorial regions. Intelligent transportation systems are being widely applied in areas such as fleet management and asset monitoring, traffic monitoring systems, traffic signal control systems, collision avoidance systems, variable traffic message signs, parking availability systems, traffic enforcement cameras and automotive telematics. The application in traffic signal control systems application is expected to account for the largest share of the Australian ITS market during the forecast period.\nThe overall market has been divided into three segments, namely, systems, applications, and territorial regions. Furthermore, the market by system has been classified into several sub-types- advanced traffic management system, advanced traveler information system, ITS-enable transportation pricing system, advanced public transportation system, and commercial vehicle operation.\nThe total market is expected to reach $1,130.2 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 14.41% between 2015 and 2020. The market for the application in advanced public transportation systems is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.90% during the forecast period. The increasing demand for the use of technology in public transportation for vehicle location and real-time information is the key reason for the growth of ITS in advanced public transportation systems.\nThe report analyzes the entire market on the basis of all the major territorial regions- New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland , Western Australia , and the Rest of Australia . New South Wales is currently a major market for Australia intelligent transportation systems; however, that in Western Australia is expected to grow at the highest CAGR of 14.95% during the forecast period. The Rest of Australia includes Southern Australia , Tasmania , and the Northern Territory.\nThe report also looks into the whole value chain and supply chain of the Australian intelligent transportation systems market. It focuses on the parent market and its segments and thus, identifies the total market potential. The report also covers drivers, restraints, and opportunity analysis of the Australian intelligent transportation systems market.\nMajor players in this market include the Thales Group ( France ), Redflex Holding Ltd. ( Australia ), Vix Technology ( Australia ), Kapsch TrafficCom AG ( Austria ), and Sigtec Pty Ltd. ( Australia ).\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03095777-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution that finds, filters and organizes the latest industry data so you get all the market research you need - instantly, in one place.\nhttp://www.reportlinker.com", "external_links": ["http://www.reportlinker.com/p03095777-summary/view-report.html", "http://www.reportlinker.com/"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:29:00.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
