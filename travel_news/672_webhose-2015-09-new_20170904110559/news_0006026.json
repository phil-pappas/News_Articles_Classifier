We didn’t invent group bike rides,” said Mike MacKool, co-founder of the nonprofit Detroit Bike City, which trademarked Slow Roll. “But we just struck the right chord at the right time for our city.”\nThe family-friendly rides and festive atmosphere have spawned affiliates elsewhere, including in Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland and Washington, D.C., and even two in Sweden and one in Iraq. They all draw riders into the city streets.\nIn Detroit, the popularity of the rides has soared as the city works to improve services and its image after undergoing the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. A population drain since 1.8 million people called Detroit home in 1950 even works in bicycling’s favor.\n“We’re flat; we’ve got infrastructure for 2 million people, with a population of about (700,000) . . . or 800,000 now,” MacKool said. “So that means we have big, wide-open, flat roads made for way more cars — which means you’ve got a lot of space for bikes.”\nThe space was needed recently for the the 14th Tour de Troit, as about 7,000 cyclists took to the streets on Sept. 19. Also enhancing the city’s stature as a bicycling hot spot is Detroit Bikes, which since 2013 has made three-speeds ideal for hill-less terrain.\nMacKool and co-founder Jason Hall rode the first Slow Roll with fewer than a dozen friends in 2011. By season’s end, it had grown to 40. Fast-pedal to 2015, when about 3,000 bicyclists take part most evenings.\nThis is no Lycra-wearing crowd on expensive race bikes. Anyone is welcome, MacKool said, “from any age from any skill to any bike.” Attire is come as you are. Bikes run from clunker to cruiser to showy custom-made styles, not unlike souped-up automobiles that show Detroit flair.\n“Everybody comes together to have a good time,” said Nate Smith of Detroit, 29, on a one-speed low-rider with a shiny red frame.\nSlow Roll has about 5,000 card-carrying members, most of whom pay a $10 annual fee that became a necessity as numbers and liability concerns grew. No one who can’t afford the fee is turned away.\nThe group works with the city and police to avoid dustups with motorists. That includes getting permits, keeping the throngs to the right with a squad of about 50 volunteers and having police escorts to control disruptions.\n“We just do as much as we can to be as accommodating as we can to the traffic,” MacKool said.\nCity leaders support the rides and included a Slow Roll headquarters in redevelopment plans for the Brewster Wheeler Recreation Center, a long-closed facility where heavyweight champion Joe Louis once trained.\nOne of the Slow Roll offshoots begun with Detroit’s help started last year in Buffalo with three rides. It expanded to every Monday this year, and participation surged from 300 to 1,800 in about 45 days, said its founder, Tony Caferro.\nHe sees similarities between the cities and their Slow Rolls.\n“You go through neighborhoods that you probably wouldn’t go through on your own or wouldn’t even know they were there,” Caferro said.\nIn Detroit, young and old wave and shout encouragement to riders, who are mostly city residents but also come from the suburbs and other states.\n“Slow Roll was started to show off our city,” MacKool said. “It’s what we love. Me and Jason are very passionate about the city of Detroit, and getting people to move back down here.\n“If they’ve never been to Detroit, this is a great way to see Detroit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T15:58:00.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
