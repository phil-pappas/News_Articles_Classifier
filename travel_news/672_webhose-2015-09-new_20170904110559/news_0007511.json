We’re getting a very fine, unique measurement of the uppermost surface,” Petro told AFP. \nMonday’s “blood moon” will be the last in a string of four total lunar eclipses since April 15, 2014, in a series astronomers call a tetrad. \nThese phenomena may be a normal part of the celestial calendar today, but for many ancient peoples it was an omen of bad things to come. \n“Throughout history many cultures have seen (eclipses) as being a sign of gloom and doom,” Petro said. \nThey weren’t always wrong. \nIn February 1504, explorer Christopher Columbus used a blood moon to trick Jamaican natives who had been feeding him and his men, but cut them off when relations turned sour. \nColumbus knew a blood moon had been forecast, and warned the natives that his god would send an angry “sign” at their treatment of the newcomers. \nLegend has it the natives came running with food as soon as the Moon turned red. \nUnlike a solar eclipse, which creates the impression of a bright “ring” of light as the Moon passes before our star, there is no danger in watching Monday’s lunar spectacle with the naked eye, the experts say. — Afp-Relaxnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T03:49:05.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
