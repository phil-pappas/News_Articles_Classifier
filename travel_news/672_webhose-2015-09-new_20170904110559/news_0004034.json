They aim to shine a light on real, grassroots rugby, capturing the unity, passion, humour and spirit of the people who play it and who are passionate and dedicated, giving up their evenings to train, working tirelessly to raise money for their clubs, and bringing rugby into the heart of the community.\nIdents from the films will be televised in seven official host broadcast partnership countries involved in Rugby World Cup 2015 so it is a unique opportunity for each of the small regional clubs featured and their local communities to get global exposure and show their dedication and passion to the game. The #WeDealInReal television advertising campaign launched in the UK on September 18, coinciding with Rugby World Cup 2015’s Opening Ceremony and England’s first match, defeating Fiji at Twickenham.\nIsle of Mull Rugby Club was chosen for the campaign due to its remote setting which sees players often hitching rides on local fishing boats to get to training. Visiting teams also have to arrive by boat and Saturday games are timed around the ferry schedule. An important focus of the island’s sporting community, the Club’s challenges inspire a greater degree of commitment from the local fans, who have taken the team to heart and are very vocal on the side lines.\nBased at Garmony near Craignure, the Club and its stunning surroundings were filmed extensively for the campaign over three days in May, with footage focussing on the male and female players, Club supporters and the local scenery.\nSource: VisitScotland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:15:21.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
