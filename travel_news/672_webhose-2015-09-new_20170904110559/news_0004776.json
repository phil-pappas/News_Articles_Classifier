It is one pleasure to gaze out over an idyllic sea view with a sundowner cocktail in hand, and quite another to engage with marine life, above and below the waterline. On a Sandals Luxury Included ® holiday, you can jump into a variety of water sports with carefree abandon because you don’t have to splash out on any additional costs. With the largest operation of water craft in the Caribbean (270 in total), catering for all speeds from steady glass-bottom seabed-viewing vessels to Hobie catamarans and high-powered motor boats, there is an extensive all-inclusive programme to explore, whether you choose to be powered by paddle, wind, flipper or outboard engine. Seek out a secluded cove in a kayak or revel in the adrenalin rush riding in an inflatable tube behind a power boat. Try out paddleboarding on calm lagoon waters or give the latest craze of kneeboarding a go. This variation of waterskiing offers an easier learning curve, not least because you are closer to the water for the inevitable falls - expect thrills and spills as you hang on to a tow rope while in a crouched position. All resorts offer sailing, windsurfing, snorkelling and aquatrikes, too, with selected resorts specialising in wakeboarding and waterskiing. Look out for darting glimpses of neon-blue and yellow angelfish, iridescent parrotfish, spongy frogfish and the slightly scary barracuda Be warned: the sensation of speed, with sun and seawater on skin, is extremely addictive, so it’s just as well that water sports are all included and unlimited. Scuba diving ushers you into a magical world of slow-mo tropical fish, intriguingly delicate coral growths and random scattered shells on the seabed. Sandals Resorts is proud to offer the most comprehensive scuba programme in the Caribbean, which is accessible to beginners and experienced divers alike. Certified divers may dive twice daily with a single tank or once daily with a double tank, while resort-certified divers can make forays once daily to a maximum of 40 feet. Many resorts have their own scuba certification pools. Once familiarised with the business of wearing masks and tanks by jumping into practice waters off the pier, and certified, guests have access to more than 240 different dive sites with up to 30 per resort and six dive excursion options per day. With top-line equipment (including Luxfer and Catalina tanks, Scubapro buoyancy control devices, regulators and fins, silicone masks, snorkels and weight belts) and PADI, DAN and NAUI certified instructors provided, safety is paramount. On board custom-designed Newton twin-diesel dive boats, you skirt beautiful coves and beaches to reach the exploration sites. Dives are guided to depths that range from 20 to 100 feet. Look out for darting glimpses of neon-blue and yellow angelfish, iridescent parrotfish, spongy frogfish, long-snouted sea horses and the slightly scary barracuda. You can request specialist experiences such as wall and wreck dives. With colours as vibrant below the waters as above, scuba diving in the Caribbean is a breathtakingly beautiful and uplifting experience. • For more information on Caribbean holidays, visit sandals.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:26:47.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
