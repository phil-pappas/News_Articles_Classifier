The timing of the services from Barbados and Grenada to/from Piarco, Trinidad with connections throughout our network, are ideal for business and leisure travellers. The schedule gives our valued customers an early start, late evening returns and easy connections in Piarco with “walk off and walk on” service soon to be implemented similar to the service provided to our Guyana passengers. It means that our customers’ precious time can be put to the best use,” DiLollo explained. \nCAL is in the exclusive position of having hubs in the southern Caribbean in Trinidad and Tobago and in the northern Caribbean in Jamaica. In this way, it is uniquely positioned to provide visitors to and citizens of the region with many travel options,” he added. \nCaribbean Airlines provides a value-added product to its customers with such initiatives as the passengers’ first checked bag flies free, frequent flyer miles, free meals, free headsets for movies and a full on-board service reflecting the warmth of the islands. \nFor more information on Caribbean Airlines’ flights visit the airline’s website at www.caribbean-airlines.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:37:53.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
