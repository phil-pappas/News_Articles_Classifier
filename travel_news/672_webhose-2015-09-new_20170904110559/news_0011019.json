The vibrant basins of the rippling natural pool are a study in contrast with the stunning force of the waterfall that crashes into them, spilling 90 feet over red rocks. It is, simply, beatific. And the falls, at the bottom of a narrow gorge near the southwest corner of the Grand Canyon National Park , are about a two-mile hike north of Supai Village in one of the most remote indigenous-American enclaves in the country.\nThe place had summoned me from the moment I learned of its existence about a year earlier. I thought that when I went I’d be instantly transported by wandering among a relatively sparse population, if but for a few long moments, living on one of those Technicolor landscapes nature bestows on you, if you’re lucky, once in a lifetime.\nI planned carefully. I would take a trip, family in tow, and descend the canyon’s depths. So we flew to Phoenix from our home in New York City, drove and stayed in Sedona and then made our way to Seligman, the birthplace of the historic Route 66, then to the end of Indian Route 18, and ultimately the Grand Canyon’s Hualapai Hilltop. Once there, we would wait, and wait, for a helicopter down to Supai.\nContinue reading the main story Slide Show Slide Show | 12 Photos Exploring Havasu Falls Exploring Havasu Falls Credit John Burcham for The New York Times\nThe exhilarating, albeit short, ride was piloted by a man whose manner was like a stoked cowboy’s. My 3-year-old son, Marceau, who had never been in a helicopter, sat quietly, scanning everything he saw out the window with eyes wide open.\nWhen we arrived, we were, indeed, transported, but it wasn’t to a different world. I stood on the landing pad of the helicopter in which we’d descended, holding my toddler’s hand in the searing midday heat. Then, as the sound of the chopper receded, it was replaced by the deliberate drumbeat of hip-hop music pouring out of loudspeakers: the lingua franca of youth cultures the world over. As we approached a nearby cafe, we found its source. A group of striking teenagers, descendants of some of North America’s most ancient people, dressed in basketball shorts, oversize T-shirts and slide sandals with socks. They were Havasupai or Supai, as locals who live on the reservation refer to one another.\nSeeing and hearing something so familiar made the long journey we’d taken to get there, if for a beat, surreal. After months of planning and hours of road-tripping, my husband, Sacha, my 18-year-old daughter, Djali, Marceau and I felt at home, despite being in a remote area of the park visited by only 20,000 people annually (compared with the five million who tour other parts). We were thousands of miles from home, yet that drumbeat may as well have been the unfurling of a grand welcome mat.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The Havasupai people — they call themselves Havsuw ‘Baaj, or “the Blue Creek people,” although they are known by the Hualapai derivative of their name, Havasu, or “blue-green water,” and pai, “people” — while hospitable were also insular by nature. But the teenagers blaring hip-hop, other locals and tourists hiking to and from the campgrounds were chilling on the deck of the only place to eat on the reservation, a food desert whose menu consisted of the same fried and greasy fare, with the exception of Indian tacos, found in many rural and low-income communities.\nAs I approached the cafe with Djali and Marceau, we noticed that several locals eating at a nearby table stared at us. We weren’t sure if we stood out because our skin tones ranged from pecan to mocha, or if, unlike the majority of visitors to the parks, our big, curly locks commanded attention. Our guide, Jason Danoff, who runs Trail Lovers Excursions, had warned us that it was highly unlikely that they would speak.\nBut when we sat down at a round table with a clear view of the landing strip, a middle-aged local man holding a cane approached us and settled the matter. “Your daughter,” he said, sitting down next to Djali, “her wild and curly hair reminds me of Diana Ross. Fierce!” He recounted seeing Ms. Ross in a concert in Central Park long ago and wanted to know everything about us: Was I married? Had I ever been to Las Vegas? Why did I have a dream catcher tattoo on my left arm? “Yes, no, and because it’s my spiritual armor,” I said.\nPhoto Lower Navajo Falls, also called Little Navajo Falls. Credit John Burcham for The New York Times I had long believed that the call for reparations to descendants of African slaves should be expanded to include Native Americans, and the situation of the Havasupai was a stark reminder of why. They were forced to relocate to this narrow gorge after roaming freely for centuries across some three million acres of the Grand Canyon’s South Rim, according to the tome “I Am the Grand Canyon: The Story of the Havasupai People,” regarded as a bible to many tribal elders. The 2010 census recorded the poverty rate on the Havasupai Indian Reservation at 37 percent, twice that of the state’s. Two-thirds of Havasupai children under 18 live in poverty. They are the antithesis of the casino-rich tribes who have become a pop culture trope.\nAs we stood looking at the people before us, their inherent will was apparent. They have kept key aspects of their culture intact, like the Havasupai language, which is part of the Hokan family of languages. (They are the only Native American community in the country where every tribal member, about 500, speaks the language.)\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story By the time Sacha and Mr. Danoff, our guide, joined us almost a half-hour later, Marceau was running around the deck yelling “Hi!” to the diners, while Djali and I picked at our tater tots and an Indian taco. It was time to go, and we grabbed our gear. We wouldn’t be seeing the locals again. We said farewell, thankful for their hospitality.\nOur lot, close to Mooney Falls, was separated from two other small parties of what looked (and sounded) like college frat boys by a stream flowing into the Colorado River. We arrived late afternoon and sat on a wooden picnic table at our home base snacking on trail mix and cranberry oatmeal cookies while Mr. Danoff pitched a green tent that slept four comfortably. He also hung a light inside to keep Marceau from freaking out in pitch darkness. (He did whimper, but minutes in, fell soundly asleep.) Djali, deciding she’d confront her fear of the dark, slept in a burnt-orange hammock affixed to two trees, with the sound of rushing water underneath her.\nPhoto Hikers climb from the base of Mooney Falls with the aid of a system of ladders and chains. Credit John Burcham for The New York Times The next morning, we rose early and, fortified by the oatmeal Mr. Danoff made for breakfast, walked about half a mile to Havasu Falls. The cactus-lined walk to the falls over tiny pebbles and terra-cotta dirt didn’t feel like a walk at all; it was more like a free-floating glide, one of those iconic camera dolly shots from a Spike Lee Joint. Once at the falls, two things happened that were beyond our comprehension.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story First, as I looked at the water crashing into pools below, it felt as if the cool mist coated our parched bodies like a salve. It was an experience no photograph, even the ones that pulled me here in the first place, could have captured. You had to be immersed in it. From the moment we dipped into the shallow part of what felt like a living tepid body of water, we became still. Tiny schools of fish swam around us, mesmerizing Marceau. We sat in Havasu’s warm waters, taking breaks to eat lunch and record as much as we could of our surroundings in those hours. Being cleansed at Havasu Falls was like an intense natural high, an almost out-of-body experience akin to watching the sun rise over the Sahara, or almost like giving birth.\nThat high came crashing down later that day when we witnessed the second incomprehensible thing. I saw a man from the other side of the stream throw a deck of cards, one by one, into the stream, just for fun. Mr. Danoff called him and told him to stop. He did, begrudgingly. We tried to collect the cards that had made their way to our side of the stream and placed them in the bags of garbage we had accumulated and would be packing out with us, as mandated by the Havasupai. (Our neighbors had skipped out, leaving several heaps of trash behind.)\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story By the next morning, we started to feel as if we were coated with chalk, most likely because of the high concentration of calcium carbonate in Havasu Falls that gives it its iridescent blue-green hue; the dips in the natural pools were worth the minor discomfort. We hiked around Carbonate Canyon, along Havasu Creek, where we could see the remnants of silver prospecting: an unspectacular entrance to an old mine and colorful rocks strewn about from explosions dating back to the 1880s. We began and ended each day at Havasu Falls, the most crowded site on the campgrounds. In between we soaked up the rare chance to spend time together as a family, free of digital distractions.\nOn our last full day at the campsite, we traipsed in the midday heat to Lower Navajo Falls and the spectacular Upper Navajo Falls, before heading back to our campsite for lunch. It was then that Mr. Danoff suggested we make the sharp approximately 200-foot descent into the mammoth Mooney Falls. As we stood close to the edge watching visitors descend, I felt vertigo coming on: There was no chance I was going to make that downward climb with Marceau to the fall’s base. Djali, realizing that she wasn’t as afraid of heights as she had thought, decided to go down with Sacha and Mr. Danoff. Marceau and I waited back at the campsite, watching from the hammock as the water rushed down the stream, until it lulled us into a deep siesta.\nOur last night at the campsite, with the exception of Marceau’s fleeting tantrum, was still and easy. Djali napped in her hammock until dinner was ready, and Sacha, still amazed that he had decided to go to Mooney Falls, was amped. “My stomach is still doing back flips from that last mission,” he said over dinner. “But I’m glad I did it.”\nPhoto Raquel Cepeda carries Marceau, 3, through a pool at Lower Navajo Falls.

And though I would have given almost anything for a warm shower, I wasn’t entirely ready to jump back into the virtual reality that had brought me here in the first place.\nIF YOU GO Not accessible by road, Havasu Canyon is managed by the Havasupai Tribe rather than the National Park Service. The Havasupai Tourism Enterprise manages the 200-person campground near Havasu Falls as well as a pack horse business that provides optional access to the trail (928-448-2121, Havasupai-nsn.gov ). Camping fees are $17 per person, per night, plus a $35 entry fee per person and a $5 environmental fee.\nThe Havasupai Tribal Cafe (928-448-2981) is the only restaurant on the reservation. The Havasupai Trading Post sells groceries although the tourist office recommends backpackers bring their own food because of limited supplies (928-448-2951). Nearby Havasupai Lodge has 24 rooms, starting at $145 per night (928-448-2111 or 928-448-2201).\nPhoto A member of the Havasupai tribe.

On the higher end, Austin Adventures offers a five-day Havasupai Hiking Tour with departures through late October and resuming again next March, from $1,648 per person ( austinadventures.com ). More affordable, Wildland Trekking runs a three-day trip though late November and four-day trips in summer, from $910 per person ( wildlandtrekking.com ).\nFour Seasons Guides offers three-day Havasu Falls hiking trips supported by pack mules (from $895) as well as other trips that combine the falls with visits to the South Rim and kayaking in Black Canyon ( fsguides.com ).\nBeyond the falls, the Grand Canyon Field Institute offers guided educational tours in the national park. Subjects include archaeology, paleontology, geology, photography and plein air painting as well as extended backcountry-hiking trips and day hikes ( grandcanyon.org/learn/grand-canyon-field-institute).\nIn Grand Canyon National Park, mule trips are the classic way to reach the bottom of the chasm. From Nov. 1 to March 31, Grand Canyon National Park Lodges organize two-night trips down 10.5-mile Bright Angel Trail on the South Rim and across the Colorado River to Phantom Ranch, the only lodge below the canyon rim, with rustic cabins for overnight stays. Trips cost $1,245.66 for two, including meals. One-night trips are available year round for $929.74 for two ( grandcanyonlodges.com ).", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HAVASUPAIJP10/06HAVASUPAIJP10-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.austinadventures.com/", "http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HAVASUPAIJP10/06HAVASUPAIJP10-articleLarge.jpg", "https://fsguides.com/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HAVASUPAIJP1/06HAVASUPAIJP1-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.wildlandtrekking.com/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HAVASUPAIJP11/06HAVASUPAIJP11-superJumbo.jpg", "https://www.grandcanyon.org/learn/grand-canyon-field-institute", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HAVASUPAIJP7/06HAVASUPAIJP7-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.havasupai-nsn.gov/", "http://www.havasuwaterfalls.net/lodge.html", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HAVASUPAI-slide-2XW0/06HAVASUPAI-slide-2XW0-jumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/travel/06HAVASUPAIJP1/06HAVASUPAIJP1-blog427.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-04T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T15:13:16.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
