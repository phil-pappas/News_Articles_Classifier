Especially as, when RAND Europe looked at the figures, it concluded that the most effective actions a company could take were providing fresh fruit and vegetables in the workplace and healthy food alternatives in canteens. In fact the majority of companies that signed up to Britain’s Healthiest Company offered these to employees and just under a third of all employees took advantage of these offerings. At TUI UK & Ireland, on-site catering offering healthy options is just one of the ways that the company aims to help keep employees on the right path to health. We encourage participation in national and local health campaigns \"We have internal health champions,\" explains Caroline Kitcher, the company's human resources director. \"These are colleagues from across the business who lead our internal engagement on our well-being activities. \"As well as organising and running well-being events, they encourage participation in national and local health campaigns – such as Stoptober for smoking, and Movember for men’s health – and provide up-to-date information about health and well-being services.\" Crucially, when it comes to nutrition, it is the health champions' role to give feedback on the dishes and menus in the company's catering so that they can be regularly reviewed to ensure employees are getting healthy and nutritious options that they actually want.
