(AP) â€” An old Great Lakes steamboat that operated as a passenger ferry for decades is now temporarily berthed in Buffalo while en route to New York City for restoration.\nThe SS Columbia arrived last week in western New York, where it will remain docked at Silo City on Buffalo's Lake Erie waterfront for the next year. While in Buffalo, the 113-year-old vessel will host celebrations, dockside tours, education programs and other functions.\nLaunched in the early 20th century, the Columbia ferried passengers from downtown Detroit to an amusement park across the border in Canada. The plans call for towing it to New York City, where the vessel will undergo restoration.\nThe Columbia is a sister ship to the SS Canadiana, which took passengers from Buffalo to an amusement park in Ontario, Canada. The Canadiana was scrapped in 2004.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:24:20.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
