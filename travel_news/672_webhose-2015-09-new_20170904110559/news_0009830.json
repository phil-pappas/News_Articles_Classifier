Browse The Market Research Report of Automotive Crankshaft Market : http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/automotive-crankshaft-market.html Crankshaft in automobile comprises of cast iron, forged steel and machined crankshaft. The function a crankshaft is to convert the linear motion of the piston to rotational motion, which in turn would power the wheels. Crankshaft can be of two designs; flat plane and cross plane. Flat plane crankshafts are much lighter but are imperfectly balanced. On the other hand cross plane crankshaft are perfectly balanced but are heavier than flat plane crankshafts.

In these kinds of vehicles a machined billet crankshaft are used as they are balanced perfectly and can withstand more force. In addition, the rising fuel prices has led the consumers for more fuel efficient cars and opting for diesel cars. Diesel cars require a forged steel crankshaft to bear the torque generated by the engine. Technologies such as machining of crankshaft have brought a transition in the recent trend of automotive crankshaft. Advanced steel and iron materials are used to manufacture crankshafts which can withstand more force and torque produced by the engines of the vehicle. Browse Press Release of Automotive Crankshaft Market : http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/automotive-crankshaft-market.htm The increase in the demand for passenger vehicles in the developing nations such as India, China and Japan among others has fuelled the growth of passenger vehicle segment in the world. With the rise of passenger vehicles, the demand for crankshaft manufacturers is also set to increase globally. Erratic fuel prices have led to shift in consumer’s preference from petrol vehicles to diesel vehicles as diesel vehicles give more mileage. During the forecast period, the preference of the consumers is expected to partly shift from standard road cars to high end performance cars, with the rising disposable income of the people across the globe.
