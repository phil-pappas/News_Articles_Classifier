It’s on the fringes of lovely countryside and is well placed for dining out or eating in – there’s a good choice of supermarkets within walking distance – and for visiting a number of the Cotswolds’ most popular family attractions. Location: 7/10 You'll find the cottage on a quiet street in the heart of Chipping Norton ‒ called Chippy by locals, hence the cottage’s name. Forget the Chipping Norton Set and implications that this market town is a venue for the rich and famous, Chippy is a no-nonsense place, staunchly proud of its independent shops and its splendid little theatre/cinema, which is just down the road from Chippy Cottage. Attractions further afield include Blenheim Palace 12 miles south, and the model railway and Birdland Park at Bourton-on-the-Water 20 minutes’ drive west. Style & character: 8/10 Chippy Cottage, Chipping Norton Cosy cottage meets contemporary cool in this 18th-century property whose interior is a blend of beams, exposed stone and cream-coloured furnishings. The owners have injected a great sense of light and space through the clever positioning of mirrors and by opening up the layout downstairs, integrating the little kitchen with the dining room. White painted wooden stairs lead to two bedrooms on the first floor (one twin, one double) and the one bathroom containing the loo (lack of a second could be awkward if there’s a full house of six people). Chippy Cottage, Chipping Norton The master bedroom is a wonderful space under the eaves on the top floor. Facilities: 7/10 The kitchen is well stocked and has an electric cooker with induction hob and a fridge with freezer compartment (there’s no separate freezer). There’s an adjoining utility area with washing machine, dishwasher and microwave. The cosiness factor is boosted by the wood-burner in the sitting room. Chippy Cottage, Chipping Norton A tiny courtyard garden has space for two to sit out. Free Wi-Fi Value for money: 7/10 Cottage from £616 in low season; rising to £1,151 in high (short breaks, from £462, possible year-round). Family friendly: 8/10 This is a sleekly presented property, yet it’s not too immaculately stylish to be unsettling for parents of small children. Complete with plenty of exposed woodwork, the twin-bedded room is an atmospheric space for kids. Travel cot, high chair and stair gate are available. Eating The cottage is a hop and a skip from a small Sainbury’s and a largish Co-op. The town’s popular eating out options including Whispers Café, Wild Thyme and The Chequers pub. Just down the road is Kingham, with two gastro pubs: The Wild Rabbit and The Plough. A mile beyond is Daylesford deli, restaurant and uber-posh farmshop. Access for guests with disabilities This is a historic property with narrow doorways and steep stairs so, unavoidably, it offers limited access to those with mobility difficulties.
