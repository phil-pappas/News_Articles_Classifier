Now, those abandoned tracks, which used to deliver bicycles, drums and organs from Chicago to the world, are bringing visitors to a part of the city that most have never ventured to see.\nUnveiled in June, the new Bloomingdale Trail is a vibrant viaduct often teeming with cyclists, strollers, runners and others in Chicago’s own version of an elevated park. Though comparisons to New York’s High Line are inevitable, the Bloomingdale Trail is longer, wider and more democratic, welcoming dogs, baby strollers, skateboarders and Rollerbladers in a sometimes chaotic parade 17 feet above the street.\n“One of the ways to re-energize the city is to re-energize public spaces,” Mayor Rahm Emanuel said of the $95-million public-private parks project (the Trust for Public Land is a partner) that the trail is a part of. “We saw this as a great opportunity to take an industrial track that for generations had divided four neighborhoods and transform it into something that could unite them.”\nThe paved trail is 14 feet across and runs west to east at a relatively flat grade above Bloomingdale Avenue, perpendicular to the shore of Lake Michigan. Its western end begins just east of Ridgeway Avenue; its eastern end runs up to Ashland Avenue and Walsh Park.\nOn a recent visit, I discovered that the best way to experience the Bloomingdale Trail is not to walk it end-to-end, but to use it as a bridge that links four neighborhoods, each with its own character and attractions. With 12 ramps that wind down to street level—often in serpentine fashion to minimize the grade—the trail is a great springboard for launching into various parts of neighborhoods and then climbing back on and continuing to the next place you want to explore.\nThe trail is about 3 miles from the Loop and an easy trip from all downtown hotels. To begin my two days exploring the trail, I took the Blue Line El from the Loop to busy Damen Avenue. From there, I walked north toward the trail through the Wicker Park neighborhood.\n© Matthew Gilson for The Wall Street Journal This eight-block stretch of Damen has outposts of national chains including Nanette Lepore, Nike Running and Marc Jacobs along with independent shops such as the Goddess and Grocer (1649 N. Damen Ave., goddessandgrocer.com), which serves delicious soups, salads and sandwiches, and the T-shirt Deli (1739 N. Damen Ave., tshirtdeli.com), a T-shirt shop that specializes in Chicago motifs.\nI hopped on the trail for a short stroll, descending to check out Myopic Books (1654 N. Milwaukee Ave., myopicbookstore.com), five blocks south of where the trail crosses Milwaukee. The city’s largest used book shop, it hosts an experimental music series on Monday nights as well as regular poetry readings.\nIn upscale Bucktown, I was drawn down to street level once again by the bacon-like smell of grilled pork wafting over from Irazu (1865 N. Milwaukee Ave., irazuchicago.com), a casual Costa Rican restaurant that draws gastronomes from all over the city for casado (thin rib-eye steak served with white rice, black beans, sweet plantains, and an over-easy egg) and tropical smoothies. To indulge my wanderlust over a drink at the end of the day, I stopped at the Map Room (1949 N. Hoyne Ave., maproom.com), a travel-themed bar with a huge selection of international beers and an equally large collection of maps and guidebooks to peruse while you sip your pint.\nFrom the looks of it, the Bloomingdale Trail is a hit with bikers. Visitors can use the city’s bike-share program, Divvy, which has many stations near the trail. At the start of my second day on the trail, I picked up my pedal-powered chariot ($7 for the day) on the edge of Julia de Burgos Park, just a block north and west of the trail in Logan Square.\nOne of the last corners of the city to gentrify, Logan Square is Chicago’s hottest neighborhood. An influx of young professionals has sparked a raging night-life scene, particularly along Armitage Avenue, about three blocks north of the trail. Weegee’s Lounge (3659 W. Armitage Ave., weegeeslounge.com) is one of the “it” bars on this strip. Its bartenders pour stiff drinks, and regulars engage in cutthroat games of shufflepuck. At Slippery Slope (2357 N. Milwaukee Ave., slipperyslopechicago.com), cocktails come in easy-to-carry bottles so patrons can drink and dance without spilling (much).\nPerhaps the most bike-friendly area near the trail is Humboldt Boulevard, a majestic roadway with a tree-lined median and spacious bike lanes. I rode my Divvy bike on it for four blocks, south of the trail, and straight into leafy Humboldt Park.\nHungry after my ride, I stopped for a meal at Puerto Rican restaurant El Nuevo Borinquen (1720 N. California Ave., nuevoborinquen.com). Their mofongo con carne frita—stuffed plantain with fried pork—was a satisfying mix of soft, crunchy, spicy and starchy.\nMy last stop on the Bloomingdale Trail was at the western terminus, where I checked out one of its many art installations. This one, an observatory built on a grassy man-made mound, provides a perch from which to view the frenetic commuter rail yard below; it also aligns precisely with the rising and setting sun on the summer and winter solstices. It’s a perfect blend of form and function. Just like the trail itself.\nThe Bloomingdale Trail is about 3 miles west of downtown Chicago. You can reach it easily by cab or on public transportation by taking the CTA Blue Line to either the Western or Damen stops ($2.25 per ride).\nYou can also rent a bicycle to get to the trail, or pick one up after you’ve arrived. Bikes are available at any number of stations through Chicago’s public Divvy bike-share system (divvybikes.com); exchange them for new ones at other Divvy stations no less than every 30 minutes. The nearest Divvy station to the trail is adjacent to Julia de Burgos Park, in Humboldt Park. Other nearby Divvy stations are at Damen and Cortland in Bucktown; Marshfield and Cortland in Bucktown; across from the Bucktown-Wicker Park library at 1701 N. Milwaukee Ave.; and at Spaulding and Armitage avenues in Humboldt Park.\n ", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdVP3e%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdVHA4.img&description=Matthew+Gilson+for+The+Wall+Street+Journal"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:55:56.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
