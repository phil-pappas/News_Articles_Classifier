Cruises are available from $A3150 and vary in length from four to 15 days. Departures are available throughout 2016.\nThe Galapagos Islands are renowned for their unique wildlife, including marine iguanas, flightless cormorants, blue-footed boobies and the giant Galapagos tortoises, and Chimu Adventures’ cruises aim to allow guests to get up close and personal with these stunning creatures which inspired Charles Darwin. Other animals guests are likely to encounter include the Galapagos penguins, flamingoes and sea lions. The diverse wildlife is also known for its lack of an instinctive fear of humans, making it easy for guests to take great photographs.\nThe various cruise itineraries also include opportunities to kayak, hike, visit the Charles Darwin Research Station, swim, snorkel, and climb near volcanoes. Guests will also see striking scenery, including the iconic Pinnacle Rock, and visit historic sites such as Post Office Bay, where 18th Century whalers used a wooden barrel to send messages home, and the remains of US barges from World War 2. The Galapagos Sea Star and Galapagos Seaman provide spacious suites, bar, lounge, sun deck and dining areas for guests to relax in after a day spent exploring the unique ecosystem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:49:16.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
