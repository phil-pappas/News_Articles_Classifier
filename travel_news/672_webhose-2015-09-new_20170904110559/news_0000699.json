Would you pack this in you carry on luggage? Teenager thought it was a good idea yesterday at Pearson airport. pic.twitter.com/zQDIsbYHpX â€” Peel Regional Police (@PeelPoliceMedia) September 6, 2015 \nThe teen was charged with 'mischief' and \"interfering with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property,\" Const. George Tudos told CBC News. \n\"The moral of the story is make sure the items you pack are allowed on a plane,\" Tudos said. \"I mean, what did he think was going to happen if he packed something like this?\" \nPeel Regional Police later shared a photo of the alarm clock on twitter, asking whether people thought it was 'good idea', which obviously, its not. \nThe clock is believed to be similar to a product created by US company Nootropic Design , \nThe 'Defusable Clock' looks like a mock bomb and \"lets you build a scary looking clock that you can actually \"defuse\". \nBut of course, the clock comes with a warning, which the teenager in question obviously failed to read. \n\"Don't bring this to school or to work, and certainly don't bring it anywhere near an airport!\" a message on the Nootropic Design , website says. \n\"Seriously, don't get yourself into trouble\". - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T03:50:56.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
