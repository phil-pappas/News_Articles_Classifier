They wish to benchmark best practice and identify trends and this report is the first to pull it all together. Uniquely, it covers the whole topic of autonomous vehicles on-road, off-road, on water, underwater and in the air, whether carrying passengers or not. Indeed, those that are only occasionally autonomous during use and those that are only weakly autonomous are identified and discussed, not least because most of them are headed to be fully autonomous in due course. Autonomous cars are dealt with soberly in the context of greater successes.\nOnly this report is up to date and global in reach, being based on interviews, events and data analysis almost entirely in 2015 and 2014. It is not an academic treatise nor is it simply a consolidation of what is on the web. A high proportion of the tables and figures are original and the jargon is fully explained. There are slides from recent conferences across the world. It is not evangelism: it is analysis, so the negatives are also presented.\nThe emphasis is on lessons of success and failure and what comes next particularly focussed on business success, with lead indicators of such success. Timelines to 2040 of market, technology and allied advances are given and detailed forecasts of sales of autonomous vehicles from 2015-2025 particularly concentrate on numbers, unit value and total market value. Because by far the most autonomous vehicles are and will be electrically driven, there is particular detail on forecasting these vehicles by land, water and air and identifying which of these will have a substantially autonomous content in future. 30 minutes of free consultancy comes with each report purchase to fill in the gaps.\nThe Executive Summary and Conclusions is sufficient for those with little time to get a good grasp of the subject. It covers definitions, the spectrum of partial to total autonomy and highly automated to fully automated vehicles. The benefits and paybacks, relative degree of difficulty, hype curve for 10 families of autonomous vehicles, technology and market sizes and timelines are clearly presented in totally original new analysis. Many thought leaders and analysts are Quote: d, not just IDTechEx. The Introduction then looks at more definitions, purposes, arguments for and against, drive train technology, control and navigation technology, autonomy without infrastructure and a profusion of military and non-military examples with technology summarised.\nOther chapters variously detail personal, industrial, commercial and military autonomous land vehicles now and in future, marine vehicles particularly the very successful Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). Then come Unmanned Aerial Vehicles that are or will be autonomous particularly examining the burgeoning Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAV) and their increasingly varied uses plus the technology making this possible. That includes collaborative swarming and Wireless Sensor (mesh) Networks (WSN).\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3007683/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/autonomous-vehicles-land-water-air-2015-2035-300141394.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR98603&Transmission_Id=201509102007PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR98603&DateId=20150910", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/autonomous-vehicles-land-water-air-2015-2035-300141394.html", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3007683/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T04:45:31.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
