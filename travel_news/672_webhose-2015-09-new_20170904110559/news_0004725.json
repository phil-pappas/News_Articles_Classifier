This constituted one of the key pieces of advice my dad gave when I was learning to drive. As important as sticking to the speed limit, he said. A really stupid, not to say completely unavoidable, thing to do. Especially if you live out in the sticks like we do. Sound advice, to be sure. But it didn’t account for the way my 17-year-old self operated financially. Because if I had a tenner in my wallet, and the fuel gauge on my Mark 2 Golf was not actually in the red, I’d naturally spend it on a doner and chips or a copy of VW Enthusiast rather than wasting it on petrol. I had broken one of my dad’s other cardinal rules, too: I’d left home without my wallet So it was that I found myself coasting on to the forecourt of an out-of-the-way garage and breathing a sigh of relief that I had made it to safety. The elation was short-lived, however, because I had broken one of my dad’s other cardinal rules, too: I’d left home without my wallet. Cursing my stupidity, I dithered for a while. I toyed with asking if the attendant would take pity on me, until I read a sign in the shop window saying: “No IOUs, even if your [sic] desperate.” It occurred to me I might just scrape together enough to purchase a couple of litres of fuel It was then that inspiration struck. A committed chino wearer, I was accustomed to the contents of my pockets falling out whenever I sat down. That meant the rear footwell of my car was routinely littered with hankies, penknives, mint humbugs, and – of course – the few spare coins that I had not spent on fast food or car mags. It occurred to me that I might just scrape together enough to purchase a couple of litres of fuel. Alas, I could not locate sufficient coinage to afford even the minimum delivery from the pump. But I did have enough for a lottery scratch card. It seemed like a gamble worth making, so I traipsed into the kiosk, pointing to the card dispenser with a shaking hand. I duly rubbed off the grey paint and revealed a simply astonishing £20 win “Can I borrow a coin?” I asked, once the cashier had taken my money. “I need to scratch it off.” Thinking that this would be a brilliant story one day, if ever I made it as a journalist, I duly rubbed off the grey paint and revealed a simply astonishing £20 win. Of course, I scurried straight back to my car and put precisely £17-worth of petrol in my tank. After all, I reasoned, I’d need at least three quid to buy a kebab on the way home… • Not everyone is quite so lucky on the motorway.
