Lonely Planet just released half a dozen new road trip guidebooks ($12.99 each). Half are French-focused, with road trips through the Loire Valley, Provence and Normandy, but the other three are prime material for California trip planning and they're sized just right to fit in your glove box. (Remind us again why it's called a glove box.) \n\"Pacific Coast Highways\" takes you from San Diego's shores to Fort Bragg with maps, suggested itineraries and tips on where to eat, sleep and play. In Big Sur, for example, the book suggests a detour to Esalen Hot Springs, where clothing-optional hot springs sit on a ledge above the ocean. \"San Francisco Bay Area & Wine Country Road Trips\" includes a jaunt to Jenner, lavender-infused mud baths in Calistoga and a hilltop hike from the city's Chinatown Dragon Gate to Grace Cathedral. And the Route 66 book takes you all the way from Chicago to Los Angeles, with plenty of kitschy stops along the way. -- Jackie Burrell, Staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T01:21:51.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
