(NYSE: N), the industry's leading provider of cloud -based financials / ERP and omnichannel commerce software suites, today announced that CartridgesDirect , one of Australia's largest online providers of genuine printer, copier and print cartridges, has selected NetSuite SuiteCommerce to capitalise on the flexibility and superior features the cloud commerce platform offers to improve customer engagement and streamline operational efficiencies. CartridgesDirect plans to replace Magento Enterprise web platform with NetSuite SuiteCommerce to run its entire online business from one unified cloud commerce platform, including ecommerce, web storefront, shipping, inventory management, order management, financials, CRM and HR. This can enable CartridgesDirect to transform its B2C and B2B ecommerce , warehouse, support desk and internal business operations. Since launching in June 2006 , CartridgesDirect has grown to be one of Australia's largest and most trusted sources of genuine printer, copier and fax cartridges. The online retailer has offices in Australia , as well as in Hong Kong supplying to the local market. CartridgesDirect plans on expanding into New Zealand later this year and the U.K. in late 2016. In addition to expanding into new markets, the company is focused on evolving its catalogue beyond cartridges into printers and accessories, which will require drop ship products direct from suppliers to end-customers to avoid keeping inventory for these new products in its warehouse. CartridgesDirect prides itself on its customer and delivery services, but was restricted by the lack of a single, real-time view of its customers due to data being held in three disparate, on-premise software solutions - Magento for ecommerce, ExactTarget for digital marketing and Microsoft Dynamics NAV for ERP. It also was prohibitive from both a cost and ongoing maintenance perspective. To move forward and continually improve the customer experience, it turned to NetSuite to provide a single, integrated commerce platform. While the initial deployment of NetSuite SuiteCommerce is planned to be in Australia only, it also plans to bring Hong Kong onto the platform in the near future, as well as subsequent markets it expands into. \"Loyalty and customer retention has always been key to our business success and we are acutely aware that if we don't continue to excel in this, it will be hard to maintain in a very competitive market,\" said Simon Williams , managing director of CartridgesDirect. \"The way we operated in the past was inefficient as there were too many different databases we needed to extract customer information from. Moving forward, we plan to integrate all of our core processes within NetSuite, which can give our employees access to the valuable real-time customer data and history they need to ensure they perform their jobs effectively and deliver a seamless customer experience.\" Why NetSuite? CartridgesDirect was initially looking for a stand alone CRM solution and while investigating SugarCRM the retailer was pointed towards NetSuite, which uncovered the broad range of features and benefits the NetSuite SuiteCommerce platform has to offer. The online retailer has been an existing NetSuite customer since early 2015, when it replaced Microsoft Dynamics NAV with NetSuite OneWorld business management platform to better manage its financials and other core back-end business operations. 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T01:28:12.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
