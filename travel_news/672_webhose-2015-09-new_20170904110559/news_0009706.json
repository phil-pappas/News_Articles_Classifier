Fritzen has joined the Club as Assistant Golf Professional, adding further professional golf expertise to the renowned Troon Golf-managed venue in the Middle East.\n \nAbu Dhabi Golf Club is a venue well-known, and frequented, by many German golfers as a result of Kaymer’s heroics. The strategic appointment will see Fritzen working as an integral part of the services team, providing significant resource to its domestic and international guests. He brings a wealth of experience of different cultures, an important factor for Abu Dhabi Golf Club given its eclectic membership, having studied at university in the USA and worked in Germany, as well as a host of new ideas to a team well-known for providing innovative ways of delivering memorable golf, and non-golf, experiences.\n \n \nWith an opportunity at Abu Dhabi Golf Club to develop his experience in golf operations, Fritzen is clearly buoyed by his appointment: “I’m ecstatic about joining the team at Abu Dhabi Golf Club. I share the same passion for golf as our guests and I’m excited by the chance to exceed their high expectations of it.\n \n \n“Every day Abu Dhabi Golf Club lives by the Troon Golf mission statement to ‘create extraordinary guest and member experiences by delivering superior service, amenities and playing surfaces’. With my international knowledge I look forward to bringing something extra, as well as additional support to many of my fellow German golfers.”\n \nFritzen is a qualified member of the PGA of America, graduating in the Professional Golf Management Program with a Bachelor of Science in Recreation & Sport Management from the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The 27 year old comes to Abu Dhabi Golf Club from his most recent posting in the USA at fellow Troon Golf facility, Kierland Golf Club, Scottsdale, Arizona. In his seven year career, Fritzen has also held tenures at Sequoyah National GC, Whittier, North Carolina, and Columbine Country Club, Littleton, Colorado as well as his homeland in Germany at Golf Club Eifel E.V., Hillesheim.\n \n \nAbu Dhabi Golf Club’s General Manager, and Troon’s “2015 Ambassador of the Year”, Paul Booth commented: “We’re delighted to welcome Felix, his passion and dedication shine through and he will be a fundamental part of our future success.\n \n \nWe welcome a significant amount of International guests every year and Felix offers an ability to draw on the skill of the team to meet and exceed all of our guests’ requirements. We are extremely fortunate to have such a cultural mix amongst our associates at Abu Dhabi Golf Club and Felix has settled in well with them all in his first couple of weeks. I, and the rest of the team, look forward to working closely with him throughout the next six months in the golfing high-season.”\n \nAbu Dhabi Golf Club continues to rank amongst the finest golf course experiences in the world, underlined by a plethora of awards in recent years. \nIts expert operational team is currently focusing their attention to its regionally famous “Gourmet Golf”, the eagerly anticipated golf tournament with an added food lovers twist, which takes place on the 7th and 8th October.\n \nLater in October, “Green Grooves Abu Dhabi”, a ground-breaking concert series, will take place for the first-time, headlined by Grammy Award-winning DJ and record-producer Mark Ronson and the Englishman’s chart-topping compatriot Labrinth on the 22nd October.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:27:10.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
