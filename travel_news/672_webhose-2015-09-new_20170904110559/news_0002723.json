In addition, World Traveller customers will have their own personal USB socket to power phones and tablets.\nRichard D’Cruze, British Airways’ in-flight entertainment and technology manager, said: “We know that in-flight entertainment is really important to our customers – being able to relax and watch a film or listen to music helps customers to pass the time enjoyably – so by installing this state-of-the-art equipment we will be able to deliver even more programming on board.”\nThe refit, which has been carried out by British Airways’ engineers in Cardiff, will include a cabin interior refresh bringing these 747s more in line with the airline’s newest aircraft.\nNew seat foams will be installed in World Traveller and World Traveller Plus to increase customer comfort and new style seat covers fitted to match those on the A380 and 787. Carpets and curtains throughout the plane will also be replaced to mirror the new aircraft colour pallet.\nKathryn Doyle, British Airways’ aircraft cabin interiors manager, said: “Our customers love our new aircraft, but the 747s hold a special place in their heart, so we’re delighted to have been able to revamp these aircraft. They’ll look and feel like new now, with enhanced comfort, technology and design.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:22:41.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
