Traveller was on the scene to bring you these exclusive snaps.\nVirgin Australia Brisbane Premium Entry\nFor business class passengers and Velocity Gold, Platinum and The Club members, the journey starts at Premium Entry : a fast-track straight from Brisbane's new valet parking area into the lounge via private and dedicated security screening lanes.\nIf you're not using the valet parking facilities, just look for the purple Premium Entry sign:\nYou're greeted in a rather spacious room with calming music in the background...\n... after which you can clear security and ascend the escalator up into the lounge proper...\n... or take the stairs and glance back at Virgin Australia's signature 'Flying Maiden'...\n... or up at the roof and its impressively-designed skylight:\nVirgin Australia Brisbane lounge\nToday's Brisbane lounge represents a complete overhaul, re-build and expansion on the previous facility which debuted in 2011, and which we're sure was worth the wait.\nSeating and facilities\nNow absent of any construction hoarding, the lounge feels particularly airy and spacious...\n... and boasts a plethora of seats for busy business travellers to get things gone:\nWhile the table depth looks rather minimal above, it's actually more than adequate for full-sized laptops...\n... which can be charged via desk-level power points, with spare USB slots for your iPhone or tablet:\nNaturally, Virgin's comfy plush chairs also make an apearance...\n... as does a business centre with computers, printing and photocopying facilities:\nSpeaking of business, if your wallet wields an invitation-only Virgin Australia The Club card, look for this obscure walkway to your left after taking the escalator from Premium Entry...\n... along which you'll find the 'secret' door into your private lounge:\nRead more: Perks of The Club, Virgin Australia's secret VIP tier\nNew espresso & wine bar\nAs first seen in Virgin Australia's Melbourne Airport lounge , Brisbane too boasts an espresso and wine bar...\n... and one that's capable of producing up to 10 cups of coffee at a time during the morning rush:\nThere you'll also find Peroni on tap, and well-signed ordering and collection points:\nDuring quieter times, we also found the staff offering coffee to passengers seated directly behind the bar...\n... and while that's not full 'table service', per se, it's nice to have fresh coffee appear next to you when you're busy typing away.\nOther food & beverage\nStaff are also on-hand to serve alcohol from 11am including beer, wine and cider...\n... in a completely new servery that also boasts the usual soups, toasted sandwiches...\n... meats, salads and dressings...\n... and a fresh supply of apples:\nThere's also a self-serve coffee machine on the far side of the lounge...\n... more apples, and a handy soft drink dispenser:\nOther amenities\nThe restrooms and showers have moved from where they were previously: now found near the centre of the lounge on the terminal side...\n... with that corridor also leading to a newly-built exit-only door to save backtracking via reception if your flight departs from the end pier.\nAdd to that a variety of reading material...\n... flight information screens throughout the lounge...\n... and an extended version skylight, intertwined with VA's signature roof leaf pattern...\n... bringing plenty of natural light into the lounge.\nAlso read: Inside Virgin Australia's new Darwin Airport lounge\nFollow Australian Business Traveller on twitter: we're @AusBT\nAbout

Brisbane.\nAnd may well have the advantage in Perth soon when their new domestic terminal opens.
