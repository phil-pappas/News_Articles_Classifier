The airline is seeking to offer in all all-inclusive fees in a bid to attract more consumers. This offer will prove highly beneficial for corporate executives, government officials and business people who fly between Johannesburg and Cape Town at least two to three times a month. It also affords business people a time for personal relaxation over the weekends or during their out-of-office hours feels Co-CEO of Skywise, Irfan Pardesi.\n“There are no limits to the number of times you can fly. One can effectively compare this deal to joining a country club where, instead of having access to the golf course, you have unlimited access to our planes,” says Pardesi.\nSkywise was launched in February and operates three Boeing 737 planes, undertaking eight daily and 52 weekly flights on the Johannesburg-Cape Town route.\nAdds Pardesi, “Subscribers” will enjoy all the perks available to Skywise passengers. These include, but are not limited to, access to Priority Pass and Prestige Access, bags weighing up to 25kg that can be checked in for free, snacks from the menu at no extra charge, a Whatsapp check-in facility and a personal travel manager.\n“That this is all available for a flat fee is unique and unprecedented for domestic travellers in this country. It is a model designed to attract frequent flyers who want to save time and avoid the hassle of searching for cheap travel. It also provides frequent flyers air travel that never ends. “\nCo-chairpersons, Tabassum Qadir and J. Malik, concludes that Skywise Airlines’ ultimate aim is to “connect people through a unique flying experience” while becoming South Africa’s “most-loved airline”.\n“In terms of this unique offer, we are confident that unlimited flying enables travellers to challenge their own limitations every day”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:11:22.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
