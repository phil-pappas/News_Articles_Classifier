There have always been dangers from anacondas and stuff like that, but the biggest threat on trips I have done ( walking the length of the Amazon , and investigating remote natural phenomena spotted on satellite images) has been people. I’ll turn up and catch them off guard, and they’ll react negatively towards me.\nWalking into an isolated village is different every time. There’s an element of apprehension until you click with a couple of people and suddenly find your feet. I try to connect with people in the way I would back home: looking them in the eye and being as honest and as forthright as possible.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ed Stafford pictured in Peru in 2008 during his journey along the Amazon river. Photograph: Keith Ducatel/AP\nThere’s almost an inverse relationship between wealth and generosity. Last year I arrived in a village in the Damakil desert in northern Ethiopia and suddenly I was being welcomed into a house, given a bed for a night and some food. You’d never get that in England. If people turned up at my flat in London, would I open the doors to them and allow them all to sleep on my living room floor? I’m not so sure.\nIn Peru, lots of the communities have been horrendously treated. Every time I came into a village, on the Amazon, I had to prove I wasn’t a bad person. Groups like the Shining Path, the guerilla group that swept through in the 1980s and 90s, left the villages in a state of constant defensiveness. When I would walk in, women would grab their children, scream and run inside.\nI was in my 30s when I did the Amazon expedition, and that extra bit of life experience enabled me not to react too strongly to certain things. In the drug trafficking area of Peru, the red zone, I had people pointing shotguns at my chest and demanding to know what I was doing there. I think if I’d been a young 20-something I might not have handled this so well.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ed Stafford spent 60 days alone on uninhabited Olorua Island in Fiji.\nI try not to be idealistic about tribal villages, but you see so many more smiles in places like that than you do here, certainly where I live in London. I love the fact that all the kids are running around and playing. It’s an open and loving society and you can see and feel that with the families and how they spill in and out of each other’s homes. People are just happy.\nI thought the people in Siberia would be somewhat frosty. Excuse the pun. Perhaps it’s because I was brought up during the cold war. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. They were the warmest, most lovely people. It was logistically quite tricky getting to the remotest places – we had to hitch rides on cargo planes – and everyone was ridiculously friendly and happy to see us. We struggled to go through an evening without having people forcing vodka down our throats.\nThese day there’s not much left to explore. Adventures end up being more about human endeavour and willpower than drawing maps or naming mountains. But it’s a healthy thing. Too many people are on couches on their phones, so anybody who does stuff that inspires people to go outdoors is achieving a positive thing.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ed Stafford in Thailand\nSome explorers are so purist that they won’t even take a satellite phone. But I think technology and exploring combine extraordinarily well. On my Amazon trip I could film, cut videos on my Macbook and upload them. People could watch videos of me running out of food and starving before I’d found anything to eat. It was a lovely juxtaposition of old and new, tech and tradition, and sharing the experience gave the expedition a bit of meaning.\nLoneliness is the biggest challenge of travelling alone. I’ve probably taken that to extremes by planting myself on a desert island for two months. We live in a world where it’s all too easy to gain your sense of self from the people around you – uploading things to Instagram or Facebook. Even if it’s for a short time, travelling alone is a great thing for everyone to experience – putting yourself in a foreign country where you have to stand on your own two feet and see how capable you are of looking after yourself.\n• Ed Stafford’s new TV series, Into the Unknown , is on the Discovery Channel, 8pm, Thursdays", "external_links":
