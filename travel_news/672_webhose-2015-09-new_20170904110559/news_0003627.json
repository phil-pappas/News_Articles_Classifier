If you are struggling to choose just one trip, take a look atour favourite Classic Journeys for inspiration. 1. Classic South Africa This two-week self-drive along South Africa’s scenic Garden Route provides a rollercoaster of experiences. The trip begins in cosmopolitan Cape Town. Take a cable car up Table Mountain and see Robben Island where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. Watch penguins waddling on the beaches, and cross a landscape studded with wild flowers to Cape Point where two mighty oceans meet. Drive north to Hermanus, where the cliff-top Marie Hotel overlooks Walker Bay. There whales come to calf and mate, and the town’s whale crier announces sightings on his kelp horn. At the private Kariega Game Reserve at Settlers Drift, search for the Big Five on two daily game drives. There is also a river cruise. 2. Classic Myanmar Myanmar, for so long closed to outsiders, is back on the tourist agenda. On this 10-day trip to the country also known as Burma, guests cruise the Irrawaddy River and visit the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon (Rangoon), as well as learning to chew betel nut and tie a Myanese sarong. In Yangon, formerly the capital, there are guided trips to the National Museum, Reclining Buddha Pagoda and Shwedagon Pagoda. The trip includes a three-night cruise to Mandalay, a visit to Bagan’s beautiful Ananda Temple, and a horse-and-cart ride at sunset to the Htilominlo and Pyathatgyi temples. At the ancient capital of Ava, visit the Bagaya monastery and the pagoda-dotted Sagaing Hills. Watch textile weavers in Amarapura before heading to the rickety teak U Bein Bridge, the longest and oldest of its kind. Then relax at the Villa Inle Resort in a lakeside villa, surrounded by lush green mountains. 3. Classic Machu Picchu This 10-day Peruvian odyssey weaves through jungle wilderness, reveals Inca treasures and embraces iconic Machu Picchu, the lost city of the Andes. First stop is the bustling capital Lima, followed by the Peruvian Amazon, one of the world’s most biodiverse places. A motorboat whizzes you down the Madre de Dios river to the exceptional Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica Lodge. See the monkeys of Rolin Island and parrots, piranhas and giant otters on a canoe trip to Lake Sandoval. There is a walk through the Sacred Valley gorge and a stay in Cusco, the former Inca capital. After arriving at Machu Picchu via the glass-roofed Vistadome, a guide puts this Inca marvel into context. Next day watch the mist unfurl and the ruins glow on a sunrise walk. 4. Classic Egypt Egypt, with its rich past, ancient tombs and temples, is the world’s oldest tourist destination. From Cairo, visit the enigmatic Sphinx, the ruins of Memphis, the pyramids of Giza and Sakkara’s even older stepped tombs, and the city’s Antiquities Museum, home to the treasures of Tutankhamun. At Luxor, board the luxurious Sanctuary Sun Boat and float away to the Ptolemaic Temple at Dendarah. Sail past the ancient temple at Esna en route to the Temple of Horus at Edfu, dedicated to the falcon-headed god. River cruising: a cruise along the Nile is an experience you'll never forget Visit the Temple of Philae at Agilika Island, moved here in the Seventies, after the construction of the Aswan Dam, and see the 300 crocodile mummies discovered at Kom Ombo. An Egyptologist will guide guests through the temple complex of Karnak. Descend into the tombs of the Valley of the Kings and Queens and marvel at the imposing cliffside Temple of Hatshepsut. 5. Classic Canada The scenery of Western Canada – wilderness, mountains, glaciers and lakes – is larger than life, and this road and rail trip showcases it to perfection. From Calgary, hit the Trans-Canada Highway to drive into the Rockies. In Banff, visit the Cave and Basin National Historic Site, take a dip in the hot springs, hike up Tunnel Mountain or ride the Banff Gondola. Take a detour to the Athabasca Glacier from the stunning Icefields Parkway before reaching Beauvert Lake. Board a boat on Lake Maligne in Jasper, home to some of Canada’s wildest scenery and wildlife, then catch the Rocky Mountaineer train to Kamloops. The train, with its clear-roofed panoramic carriages, chugs past Mount Robson, slices through the Rainbow Range into Fraser Canyon and squeezes through Hells Gate, before emerging into Fraser Valley and on to Vancouver.
