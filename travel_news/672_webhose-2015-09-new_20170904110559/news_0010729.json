For an unusual way to celebrate, take an air tour of the Grand Canyon. There will be helicopter and airplane tours available, and lots of tour options to choose from. Grand Canyon Tours Out Of VegasLas Vegas is the hub for all tour flights to the West Rim of the National Park. Air tours come in two options, which are landing, or air only. The air-only tours just fly over the canyon, while the landing tours let you out at the bottom of the canyon next to the Colorado River, or on top of the rim. You can save money by taking an air only tour, but if you can work it out with your budget, a landing tour will provide the best experience. Landing tours include a flyover, which is then complemented by some exciting landing options. For instance, you can book a landing tour that descends to the canyon floor where you enjoy a champagne picnic and take a relaxing boat ride along the river. Another option is to land at the top, and take the VIP experience at the Skywalk viewing platform. This transparent platform will allow you to step out on a transparent deck, which is 4000 feet from the bottom of the canyon. Even after being in a helicopter, this is an exhilarating experience. South Rim Airplane ToursThe most affordable air tours are the airplane tours, plus, they are the best option when you have a big family or group that wants to fly together. Airplanes take the same flight path as helicopters, although they fly at higher altitudes. Also, airplanes can't fly down to the canyon floor, however, they only cost around 80 percent of what you would pay for a helicopter flight. Plus, you can book an airplane tour from Vegas that flies to the South Rim, but helicopters can't fly that far. Flying to the South Rim is the way to go since it is only an hour away by plane, and if you drive it will take more than five hours to get there. Once you arrive at the South Rim, you can take a fun Jeep tour through the park, tour by bus, or take an air tour of the park that covers the South and North Rims and the land all the way to the eastern edge of the park. The helicopter tours of the South Rim are thirty or fifty minutes long. The longer flight is ideal because it lets you see about 3/4 of the whole national park. You will have plenty of options to combine helicopter, Jeep, or bus tours on the ground, so no matter how much time you have or what your budget is, you will find a package that suits you at the South Rim. Buy Your Tour Online Before It Sells OutLabor Day is a very busy vacation holiday weekend, so you need to book your tour as soon as possible. You probably want to get your tour booked as soon as you get your hotel reservations made. Book online to save money on agent fees, and pay with your credit card to confirm your seats on the day that you want to fly. An air tour of the Grand Canyon is an amazing experience you'll never forget. You'll get to see breathtaking scenery, soak up Native American culture, and immerse yourself in nature, plus you'll have some thrilling adventures too.
