Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 28, 2015 eTN   \nRwanda participated in the TUR Travel Fair in Stockholm taking greater aim at the Swedish and Scandinavian market, seen as one of the most lucrative in Europe given the high household incomes. \nThe trade show, held at the Stockholm Waterfront Exhibition Centre, attracted those crucially-important buyers and also a very large number from the public keen to select future holiday destinations by getting first-hand information. \n“Rwanda has everything Africa has to offer in one country. From mountains for hikers, Savannah wildlife for safari enthusiasts, to rain forests for nature and bird lovers,” the Rwandan Ambassador, Nkulikiyinka, told visitors to the fair at an event hosted by Rwanda. \nA Stockholm-based Rwandan cultural troupe – Imanzi - was on hand to entertain guests on Saturday afternoon. \nAmong the speakers was Erika Lejon Flodin, a student at Sweden’s Uppsala University, who narrated her experience traveling and living in Rwanda over a six-week period. \n“Rwanda combines breathtaking landscapes, vegetation wildlife, and importantly for me, a very safe atmosphere,” she said in a public talk during Rwanda’s time slot on the travel fair stage. \nThe Rwanda Development Board’s (RDB) Marketing Manager for Tourism and Conservation, Ms. Linda Mutesi, highlighted the different attractions on offer in Rwanda. She also met several tour operators offering Rwanda as a destination as well as potential partners. \nSweden and the rest of Scandinavia are home to many avid hikers - a demographic group that will no doubt find Rwanda’s landscape, favorable climate, and the safety of visitors particularly appealing. \nThousands of people attended the two-day travel fair which took place in Stockholm for the first time last weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:21:40.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
