Springtime means the full throng of summer visitors has not yet arrived. Take advantage of the warmer weather and longer days in Canada's northern territories: the Yukon , the Northwest Territories , and Nunavut . \nJune Cons: Some of the most popular Canadian festivals and events are not yet under way. Beware of black flies, deer flies and horse flies throughout Central Canada, mostly forested areas. They bite and can make life quite miserable. Bring repellent, light clothing that gives maximum coverage and a hat. Find more information on black flies in Canada. \nGood to Know:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:08:30.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
