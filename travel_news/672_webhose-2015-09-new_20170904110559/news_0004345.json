The state capitol ranks fourth in the comparison of German cities from the viewpoint of the “European Promoters” group of customers. Published in the current “TagungsBarometer” (Convention Barometer), these results confirm the path and strategy followed by Düsseldorf Congress Sport & Event GmbH. “For several years now, we have been focusing on conferences with more than 1,000 participants, as well as corporate and business events, on both the national and international levels. This is where we see an above-average potential for Düsseldorf,” says CEO of Düsseldorf Congress Sport & Event, Hilmar Guckert. \nDüsseldorf as a Convention Destination At just under 79%, the so-called business events represent the largest portion of the market activity. Similarly, 79% of the promoters are from the business sector. Among the top industries listed in the TagungsBarometer are IT/telecommunication, chemistry/pharmaceutical, and professional associations, whereby many of the latter cover medical events. This also reflects the competence fields of the Düsseldorf location, as defined in the competence field atlas from the German Convention Bureau (GCB). Promoters as well as Participants are International More than half of the promoters are national, and almost 8% of them come from abroad – a significantly higher percentage as the average in other major German cities, which is currently only 3%. At 8.6%, the portion of international participants in Düsseldorf is also higher than the German average of 6.7%. Thanks to its optimal infrastructure, Düsseldorf offers ideal conditions for international promoters, as well as international participants. This is also evident in the event venues operated by Düsseldorf Congress Sport & Event, which are ideally suited for international conferences and corporate events in regard to their location, size and features. Events as an Economic Driver Düsseldorf Congress Sport & Event continuously contributes to the economy of the city. The economic significance of events is a major factor in this contribution: conference visitors, corporate events, sports events, concerts and shows all leave money at the event location – in hotels and restaurants, in retail outlets and local public transportation. A conference participant spends approximately 386 euros per day in Düsseldorf, while visitors of international conferences spend even more: approximately 493 euros. The city benefits from this so-called indirect revenue in the form of taxes, sales and jobs. Making the Location Future-Proof “In order to continue to tap into our potential and to bring even more conferences with more than 1,000 participants to Düsseldorf, we believe that it is important to keep implementing measures to make the CCD Congress Center Düsseldorf fit for the future,” exclaims Hilmar Guckert. “We have already undertaken modernisation work in recent years, and will continue with this moving forward.” The long-term complete renovation of all exhibition halls offers the opportunity to make halls 1, 2 and 3 – which have not yet been renovated – fit for conferences. The new construction of halls 1 and 2 as well as the south entry of the exhibition centre, is creating momentum for both Messe Düsseldorf’s exhibition business and Düsseldorf Congress Sport & Event’s conference and event business. The future modern face of the southern exhibition grounds, which the CCD Congress Center Düsseldorf is also a part of, will strengthen the attractiveness and the position of the state capitol as a destination for trade fairs, conferences and events.
