But if you’re looking for a truly relaxing getaway, the early fall season might be the area’s best-kept secret. “The tourist rush ends with the August heat, so everything is quiet and relaxed, and the weather is still incredible—even warm enough to swim in the lake,” says U.S. expat and Como local Michael Whalen .\nPlus, with the newly opened Pedemontana highway—which lets you bypass Milan traffic and gets you from Malpensa (Milan’s international airport) to Como in 30 minutes—making the trip has never been easier. It’s also a convenient excursion for those visiting the Expo Milano , which runs through the end of October, or those who are in need of a break post– Milan Fashion Week . Still need convincing? Here are three just-opened spots—a hotel, concept store, and restaurant—that are ushering in a new wave of modern elegance in Como.\nVilla Làrio :\nThis five-month-old, all-suite hotel is reason enough to book a trip to Lake Como. Upon arrival, guests take a glass elevator down to the lakefront property, which is optimally situated for sunset viewing. In addition to having a sophisticated contemporary design that feels thoughtfully minimalist but still comfortable and welcoming, an on-site restaurant with an inventive Italian menu, and one of the most breathtaking infinity pools in existence, Villa Làrio’s attentive staff can arrange anything your heart desires—from a tomato tasting with produce from the hotel’s garden to private boating on the lake.\nFigli dei Fiori :\nThis well-established floral design and garden studio—know for its free-form, nature-inspired style—recently opened a retail component in its building, a former mechanics workshop. The store, where you can pick up arrangements on demand or peruse a curated selection of home and gift items like Seletti housewares and Nordic-inspired ceramics, also doubles as an event space. Floral arranging, cooking and painting classes, as well as special dinners and cultural meetings are held regularly.\nCasa Santo Stefano :\nIn this converted villa, situated to the west side of the lake, you’ll find a three-room, 40-seat restaurant that’s been decorated to feel like a refined modern home. The intimate space’s interiors—done by Italian designer Pietro Castagna —include clean-lined wood paneling, a library of vintage books, and ample windows so you can take in Casa Santo Stefano’s impressive lake views even when you’re sitting indoors. The seasonally inspired menu, created by chef Davide Caranchini , is focused around using the best local ingredients and is adventurous but still rooted in Italian tradition.
