No — unless you’re a boxer Four ways to collaborate peacefully on creative projects \"FOR hundreds of years, the population has been seduced, scammed, and brainwashed into fitting in, following instructions, and exchanging a day’s work for a day’s pay,\" writes entrepreneur and marketer Seth Godin in Linchpin.\n\"Like scared civilians eager to do whatever a despot tells them, we give up our freedoms and responsibilities in exchange for the certainty that comes from being told what to do.\"\nOnce upon a time, people could go to work, hide their big ideas, go through the motions, and still get paid. But all that did was create \"a legion of frustrated workers\" who grew tired of wasting their abilities by working like robots.\nAccording to Godin, that era has ended just in time.\n\"There are no longer any great jobs where someone else tells you precisely what to do,\" he says. \"Our world no longer fairly compensates people who are cogs in a giant machine.\n\"Now we’re facing a full-fledged revolution — a hypercompetitive world involving art and gifts and fear and the ability for anyone to make an indispensable contribution to something you care about.\"\nGodin admits that some jobs will remain low in pay, low in respect, and high in turnover. These are the jobs in which showing up is all that matters. These are also the jobs that someone else can always do better, faster, or cheaper than you. The best jobs will be filled with people who make a difference by doing work that is hard to find from anyone else.\n\"There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labour,\" he says. \"Now there’s a third team: the linchpins.\n\"Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organisations. Like the small piece of hardware that keeps a wheel from falling off its axle, they may not be famous but they’re indispensable. And in today’s world, they get the best jobs and the most freedom.\"\nSo, what is a linchpin? Godin defines them as the people who — regardless of title — invent, lead, connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos.\nThey are the people who figure out what to do when there is no rule book.\nThey are the people who delight and challenge their customers and peers. And they are the people who love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art.\n\"Over time, organisations won’t pay extra for someone who merely does the easy stuff,\" Godin continues. \"The only way to get what you’re worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labour, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organisations and people care deeply about. The best future available to us is a future where you contribute your true self and your best work.\"\nIt’s not easy to become indispensable. Godin admits it involves doing \"labour in the best sense of the word\".\n\"It demands that you bring your whole self to work, engage in tasks that require maturity and soul and personal strength, and do it for the right reason.\"\n\"The hard work isn’t lifting or shoving or sharpening. The hard work is being brave enough to make a difference.\"\nPart of that hard work requires working well with others. Godin explains that your personality and attitude are more important than the actual work you do because indispensable work is connected to others.\n\"Indispensable linchpins are not waiting for instructions, but instead, figuring out what to do next,\" Godin says.\n\"If you have a job where someone tells you what to do next, you’ve just given up the chance to create value.\n\"It’s unprofitable to establish a career around the idea of doing what the manual says. The world wants you (and needs you) to bring your genius self to work.\"\nCreating a career where you are seen as the indispensable linchpin may first seem to be a selfish goal, but Godin believes that achieving this goal requires you to give \"selfless gifts\" that benefit everyone.\nWhen an organisation becomes more human, more remarkable, faster on its feet, and more likely to connect directly with its customers, it becomes indispensable.\n\"Not only does this fulfil our potential as workers and citizens, it is also precisely what the marketplace demands,\" he says. \"Instead of focusing on complying with management as a long-term strategy for getting more stuff and being more secure, we have a chance to describe a powerful vision for our future and to actually make it happen.\"\nThe takeaway message from his book is that we are no longer \"faceless cogs in the machinery of capitalism\". Every day gives us a chance to choose a new direction. And if we are not yet indispensable in our work, it is because we have not yet made the choice to go down that path.\n\"And it is a choice,\" Godin says. \"A choice to buy into the fear and the system or to chart your own path and create value as you do. There’s no room for compromise here, because those who are competing with you are specialising. They’re going to obsess about either fitting in or standing out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:58:34.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
