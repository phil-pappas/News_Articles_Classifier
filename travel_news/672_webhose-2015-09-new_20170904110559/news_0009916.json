The Luxury Included ® concept invites you to indulge in holiday pampering and to play unlimited games of tennis on courts lit for night play or to join fellow guests for fun sessions of beach volleyball, basketball, squash or racquetball. More languid games of croquet, billiards, table tennis, darts, bocce ball or lawn chess await, too, where competitive edge is nicely lulled by the signature rum punch. For golf lovers, Sandals is absolute paradise. With six all-inclusive golf resorts located in Jamaica, St Lucia and the Bahamas, golfers relish the challenge of narrow fairways on spectacular peninsula courses. For example, Sandals Emerald Bay, home to Sandals Emerald Reef Golf Club, is an 18-hole, 7,001-yard championship course designed by Greg Norman and voted the Bahamas’ leading golf resort in the World Golf Awards. Guests return again and again to tackle six legendary holes that edge the rocky sea for unforgettable play. Sandals Regency La Toc in St Lucia poses plenty of challenges with a nine-hole, par-33 course, set atop scenic bluffs and surrounded by white cedar, almond trees and bamboo. The fourth hole has sweeping sea views. Views from its 18-hole, par-71 championship course (which earns a four-star rating from Golf Digest) take in a backdrop of St Ann Mountains And the Sandals Golf and Country Club in Jamaica is the island favourite. Views from its 18-hole, par-71 championship course (which earns a four-star rating from Golf Digest) take in a backdrop of St Ann Mountains. At Sandals Ochi and Sandals Royal Plantation in Jamaica and Sandals Grande St Lucian and Sandals Halcyon Beach in St Lucia, too, the deal is the same. Golfers enjoy free round-trip transfers and complimentary green fees. For butler guests at Sandals Emerald Bay, unlimited golf is complimentary. For all other guests, two rounds per stay are complimentary. Other privileges include PGA-certified clinics where you can hone your driving, chipping or putting skills. The uninitiated can take up the game under the guidance of a PGA professional (private lessons are available by appointment at an additional cost). Resort-style clubhouses painted in brilliant hues make for relaxing time toasting success at the 19th hole. Their pro shops offer TaylorMade-Adidas equipment for purchase or rental, golf club storage and clothing. Back at the resorts, guests keen to maintain a gym regime - mindful, perhaps, of the delicious food on offer at the myriad restaurants - can embrace the Red Lane ® Fitness Centres where everything is complimentary: professional instruction, classes and state-of-the-art equipment such as treadmills, elliptical machines, stairclimbers, exercise bikes, free weights and so on. Look at a map of your resort site and you will spot a huge variety of activity zones, from the air-conditioned indoor gym to open-air workout areas and fitness classrooms for aerobics. Exercise becomes more enticing when it translates into aquacise classes in the pool or yoga, Pilates and stretching in a beachfront gazebo and over-the-water pier. When a powder-soft Caribbean beach is the venue, it is hard to resist a morning power walk. • For more information on Caribbean holidays, visit sandals.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:40:15.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
