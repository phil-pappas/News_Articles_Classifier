Dengue on the move Strong protective measures against mosquitoes are not only advisable for travel to the sub-tropical and tropical countries of Asia and Africa, but also, increasingly, to southern Europe as well, a German health institute is warning. Dengue fever is spreading in the region, as the Asian tiger mosquito, which carries the disease, is spreading to countries outside the tropics, reports the Centre for Travel Medicine (CRM) in Dusseldorf. In August, for example, two people in southern France came down with dengue fever, the CRM said, citing French health authorities' reports. - DPA Kung fu fighting In the countryside outside the birthplace of the Chinese sage Confucius, 35 students - the vast majority of them foreigners - battle the elements as well as exhaustion at a remote kung fu training academy. The students in Qufu, from as far afield as Brazil, Ukraine, Spain and France, vary in age from six - a young boy who accompanied his mother on a summer holiday - to 50. It is a disciplined, regimented regime, with activities beginning at 6am every day and featuring several hours of practice. This includes runs up and down thousands of steps through the steep hills of a neighbouring national park, interspersed with meals. The students are divided into three groups based on their ability, with each group assigned a kung fu master who blows a whistle at the start of every activity. Learners can choose how long to stay, from those taking short breaks to one Dutch man who has been training for a year to become a kung fu master and open his own academy in Holland. Walks on the wild side The Gujarat government in India is working on a new policy to attract more holiday-makers with a focus on developing eco-tourism spots, especially wildlife, with added participation from the private sector. The new tourism policy will replace the existing one, which was announced in 2009, Saurabh Patel, Gujarat Finance Minister, who also holds the Tourism portfolio, said recently. \"We are working on a new tourism policy right now. Through the policy, we will try to develop new destinations and boost eco-tourism, especially wildlife tourism,\" he said. Tucked away in westernmost India, Gujarat is rich in natural sites varying from a mythical full moon over desert in Rann Utsav to wild birds in Na Sarovar Lake. Visit www.GujaratTourism.com.
