Credit: PA Manchester City Council has fined drivers more than £7.5 million for straying into bus lanes during the last five years.\nThe data, released through a Freedom of Information request, shows the fines exceeded more than £2.1m alone for the financial year 2014/15.\nOne bus lane running on Rochdale Road from the city centre to Blackley is bringing in at least £800 per day in fines.\nBlackley and Broughton MP Graham Stringer said:\nPeople are being fined unnecessarily. There is no public transport benefit to these fines and local people and the local economy is paying high price for another ill thought through scheme.\n– Graham Stringer, MP Blackley and Broughton Last updated Wed 2 Sep 2015 Travel Manchester Greater Manchester", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T03:22:17.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
