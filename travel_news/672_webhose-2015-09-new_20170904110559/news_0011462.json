The property will be Tuscaloosa's first riverfront hotel, the city's first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified hotel and the state of Alabama's first Hotel Indigo hotel. \nJoel Eisemann, Chief Development Officer, IHG, The Americas said: \"We are delighted to bring the Hotel Indigo brand to Tuscaloosa. We have grown Hotel Indigo significantly over the past three years, and with 62 hotels open and a further 64 in the pipeline, there is strong momentum for continued global growth. We look forward to the opening of the Hotel Indigo hotel in Tuscaloosa and welcoming guests to this great neighborhood.\" \nJudd Bobilin, CEO and President of Chance Partners commented: \"We are thrilled about the addition of the Hotel Indigo Tuscaloosa Downtown to Riverfront Village and our partnership with the city. The local flavor and unique offer of the Hotel Indigo brand will fit perfectly with the walkable, mixed-use community we've developed in Downtown Tuscaloosa's Riverfront Entertainment District. With several new restaurants and storefronts also joining Riverfront Village soon, we know we'll be able to provide visitors to the area with many opportunities to experience the local scene.\" \nThe Hotel Indigo Tuscaloosa Downtown hotel, expected to open in winter 2016, will be located at 120 Greensboro Avenue. The 91-room property will have approximately 1,000 square feet of executive meeting space, a fitness center, a business center and a 2,500 square foot outdoor terrace with breathtaking views of the Black Warrior River and the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater. \nEvery Hotel Indigo property is uniquely designed to reflect the culture, character and history of its surrounding neighborhood. This Downtown Tuscaloosa location will have a unique neighborhood story that will be woven throughout the guest experience, from the seasonal and locally sourced food and drinks served in a stylish environment at the restaurant and rooftop deck and tapas bar, to the art, photography and architecture incorporated into the hotel's design. \nGuestrooms will feature plush bedding, hard-surface flooring with area rugs, and spa-inspired bathrooms. The hotel will feature the brand's Neighborhood Guide, an innovative touchscreen display that connects guests to each other, to local neighborhood mainstays, and to Hotel Indigo locations around the world. Hotel team members, many of whom are locals themselves, will share their favorite hidden gems with guests looking to explore and discover the neighborhood. \nWalter Maddox, Mayor of Tuscaloosa added: \"Downtown Tuscaloosa and our riverfront are emerging beyond what we envisioned 10 years ago when I took office and we dreamed big. The Hotel Indigo brand has an uncompromising reputation which will enhance the Tuscaloosa experience for our guests and create synergy in our Central City.\" \nSpearheaded by developer Chance Partners, the $60 million Riverfront Village is a 7.5-acre mixed-use development of 192 luxury apartments, more than 27,000-square-feet of retail space. With the addition of the Hotel Indigo Tuscaloosa Downtown, Riverfront Village will offer a truly unparalleled and dynamic mixed-use community for residents, visitors and community stakeholders in Downtown Tuscaloosa.
