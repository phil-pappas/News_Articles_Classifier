Weego is entering the automotive and powersports industries with their full line of portable power products. Created for peace-of-mind by increasing safety, convenience and ensuring ease of use, Weego has already cornered the marine market saving thousands of boaters and anglers from ruined days on the water. DRIVEN and Weego have partnered to create a strategic public relations and media plan to further expand its brand by targeting the motorcycle, powersports, and automotive industries.\n\"DRIVEN was born in the motorcycle and automotive industries and are thrilled to bring Weego power to the pavement. Expanding the Weego brand into two, three, and four wheels will help eliminate the stress, concern and safety issues many drivers and riders can experience,\" said Mike Caudill , President of DRIVEN Public Relations. \"In today's world, staying powered is key! Whether it's riding a motorcycle on a desolate highway, talking on a phone, searching the internet on a tablet or finishing up some slides on a laptop, without power we stop moving forward. Weego has solved that problem and the powersports and automotive industries should know how to keep going without worry.\"\n\"We are very excited to bring this amazing product line to the automotive and powersports community,\" said Gerry Toscani , CEO of Weego. \"Weego was created to provide a quality solution that offers freedom and independence for everyone: from moms to mechanics. A solution that is not only essential for emergencies but handy for everyday use. Our goal with the jump starter line is to eliminate the need for unwieldy jumper cables and bulky jump boxes. And we know we can! It was imperative that we find an agency that understands our goals as well as the world of the automotive and motorcycle dealer and consumer. With DRIVEN's extensive experience and knowledge, in crafting a plan to increase brand awareness with the trade and consumer alike, we're confident they will take the Weego brand to the next level.\"\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150928/271505LOGO\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150928/271506LOGO\n releases/weego-selects-driven-public-relations-as-strategic-partner-to-champion-the-automotive-and-powersports-industries-300150270.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150928/271506LOGO", "http://drivenpublicrelations.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150928/271505LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA13901&Transmission_Id=201509290807PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA13901&DateId=20150929", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150928/271505LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150928/271506LOGO", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weego-selects-driven-public-relations-as-strategic-partner-to-champion-the-automotive-and-powersports-industries-300150270.html"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T16:34:54.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
