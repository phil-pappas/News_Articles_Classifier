(AP) â€” Downtown Disney has become Disney Springs and the popular Walt Disney World complex is also getting a new look.\nThe name change was made officials during a ceremony on Tuesday at Waterview Park next door to Jock Lindsey 's Hangar Bar, which has an Indiana Jones-theme. On Wednesday, a new restaurant, Morimoto Asia, opens to the public.\nKeith Bradford , the vice president of Disney Springs, said the new name is \"a huge milestone.\" And, he said, \"there's plenty more to come.\"\nThe Orlando Sentinel ( http://bit.ly/1FDtL1L ) reports the Disney Springs project was announced in 2013. The renovation includes an increase in dining, shopping and entertainment options that should be completed in 2016. Two parking garages and a new link to Interstate 4 are also in the works.\n\"The I-4 connector will open up in October,\" Bradford said. \"That will ease a lot of pressure off of Buena Vista Drive and more direct access to the property.\"\nHe says the ramp will have an option that offers the ability to drive directly into the Disney Springs garage.\nA second garage and the Town Center section of Disney Springs is slated to open next summer.\nThe complex has also announced the addition of retail stores, including Lilly Pulitzer, Uniqlo, Edward Beiner eyeware, Pandora, Tommy Bahama and Zara. An NBA Experience, which will include a restaurant and retail, will open in the old DisneyQuest location.\n\"We've always got more news coming,\" Bradford said. \"We have a ton of announcements that we're just not ready to share yet.\"\nConstruction at Disney Springs is set to end in 2016.\n___\nInformation from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1FDtL1L", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:45:09.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
