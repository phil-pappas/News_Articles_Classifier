As the average fuel price of Singapore kerosene for the month of August in 2015 was US$57.25 per barrel, the benchmark fuel price used for calculation of the fuel surcharge level will be within the range of US$55.00 to US$59.99 per barrel (refer to table below).\nThe international cargo fuel surcharge will therefore be 31 yen per kg on long-haul international routes, 21 yen per kg on medium-haul international routes, and 13 yen on short-haul routes.\nInternational Cargo Surcharge\nBenchmark Fuel Price Range\n(US$/bbl) Surcharge by Route (per kg) 1.Long-haul Routes\nJapan – Americas, Europe,\nMiddle East, Africa 2.
