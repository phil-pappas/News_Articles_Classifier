There was a lot riding on our employees' ability to deliver.\n\"Today, as we celebrate the one millionth nine-speed produced, I can honestly say that everyone involved rose to the challenge and exceeded expectations,\" Harlow continued. \"You have proven that our decision to invest here was a wise one and demonstrated what makes this workforce one of the best in the business.\"\nAlong with recognizing the dedication of its employees, the Company chose this opportunity to also introduce the nine-speed automatic transmission as the newest member of the TorqueFlite family. The TorqueFlite automatic transmission has a long history, dating back to 1956. First introduced in Imperial models, TorqueFlite transmissions were known for having superior performance while also being extremely tough and reliable. The new nine-speed embodies those same characteristics, but in a modern day package, deserving of the TorqueFlite name.\n\"Our TorqueFlite nine-speed transmissions deliver superior performance in a broad range of driving environments both on road and off road,\" said Lux. \"We're extremely proud to hit the first milestone and look forward to engineering and building millions more for our customers.\"\nPlans for nine-speed automatic transmission production were confirmed in November 2010 . FCA US , then known as Chrysler Group, announced that it was partnering with Friedrichshafen, Germany -based ZF Group, which was making its nine-speed designs and technology available to the Company and its Kokomo plants. The Company also announced that it would invest nearly $850 million in its existing transmission manufacturing facilities in Kokomo to produce the new advanced front-wheel drive automatic transmission.\nNot quite three years later, the Company announced that it would invest $162 million to open a new facility to produce the nine-speed in Tipton, Ind. , creating up to 850 new jobs.\nThe first nine-speed automatic transmission rolled off the line 28 months ago at ITPI. In May 2014 , production moved to the new Tipton Transmission Plant, establishing it as the global hub for nine-speeds and bringing additional work to three of the Company's facilities in Kokomo . Kokomo Casting produces castings for the new transmission; Kokomo Transmission machines the prismatic parts – housings, blocks and heads; and ITPI produces the rotating parts – gears and cranks. All components are then shipped to Tipton for final assembly.\nWhen it reaches full capacity, Tipton will ship about 800,000 finished transmissions a year in all-wheel, four-wheel and two-wheel drive configurations. The Tipton -built nine-speeds are sent to Toledo, Ohio , for use in the Jeep Cherokee and to Sterling Heights, Mich. , for the Chrysler 200, as well as to FIAT plants in Melfi, Italy and Pernambuco, Brazil for the Jeep Renegade; the TOFAS plant in Bursa, Turkey for the Ram ProMaster; and China . The potential exists to expand production to other international facilities as needed.\nIn addition to the nine-speed automatic, ITPI also produces the six-speed automatic for Ram Trucks, Cummins Diesel and Heavy Duty. The plant employs more than 2,600 people. The Tipton Transmission Plant was dedicated in May 2014 and currently employs nearly 800 people.\nOn July 17 , the Kokomo Transmission Plant marked the one millionth TorqueFlite 845RE eight-speed automatic transmission to roll off the assembly line.\nAbout FCA US LLC\nFCA US LLC is a North American automaker with a new name and a long history.
