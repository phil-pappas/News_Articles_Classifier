When you visit, though, you realise this could be another world altogether.\nWe land on a lava field for our seven-day getaway and head straight to the capital Reykjavik, a small and smart city surrounded by snow capped volcanic plateaux.\nThe coffee shops, bars, boutiques and restaurants are varied, vibrant and brimming with quality.\nWe eat great local lamb, lobster and of course fish. Smoked puffin is also good but fermented skate is a taste even many Icelanders find hard to stomach. Imagine sticking your head in a bucket of ammonia and breathing in deeply… we didn’t ask for seconds.\nEarly in the morning we are picked up by our guide in a Land Rover with huge over-sized tyres and driven up into the Thingvellir National Park, a Unesco World Heritage site. Just 20 minutes out of the city we are in open desolate high ground, where melting snow reveals black volcanic ash beneath, and peaks and ranges reveal themselves as the horizon grows.\nWe are on the Golden Circle, home to some of the most famous Icelandic natural sights. Locals bake bread in the ground at one of many thermal hot spot pools, and we walk in the rift valley where the Viking settlers held the first Icelandic Parliament in 930.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Lions in the wild and a herd of elephants in the swimming...

Share this article Share 52 shares We drive on to one of the Golden Circle’s main attractions, the hydrothermally active Haukadalur Valley, home of the spouting hot springs. The Great Geysir, giving all other geysers in the world their name, only blows infrequently but others close by are bubbling and spitting constantly.\nFrom here, empty roads lead us to the Gullfoss waterfall, an immense staircase of raging glacial meltwater.\nThe road disappears beneath pack ice so we stop, deflate the tyres and continue, the horizon being our only guide. We somehow manage to reach a glacier and are rewarded with incredible views, before snowmobiling, sledging and walking in complete isolation and jaw-dropping beauty.\nSue was rewarded with incredible views while snowmobiling and sledging on her Iceland adventure\nThe following day we pick up a hire car and drive to Husafell at the eastern foot of the Langiokull Glacier.\nHere we board a mighty bus known as The Ice Explorer, which has been specially designed and engineered for the unique terrain of glacial ice and volcanic ash by our guide, the equally unique Arngrímur Hermannsson.\nThe bus climbs up to the snow line, where the road ends, but we continue towards a tiny spot 4,100ft up on the ice cap. Our destination is the newly opened Ice Cave for the ‘Into The Glacier’ tour. When we arrive, a man excavates last night’s snow from a small James Bond-like opening in the ice and we enter a tunnel. Thousands of years of the glaciers’ existence are revealed in strata in the walls. Volcanic eruptions can be traced by layers of ash – crevasses appear and brilliant blue ice surrounds us. It’s like no other place on earth and later, back at base, we look back to the summit, and can’t quite believe where we have just been.\nIceland is not all about ice and snow and glaciers, as this scenic shot proves\nIn the town of Akureyri on a northern fjord, we meet our guide Gísli Rúnar Víðisson, a huge, warm and welcoming viking of a man. Born and bred here, a mussel farmer, muscle car collector and, lo and behold, an opera singer, he drives us out of town to the tip of the fjord.\nIn the summer, humpback whales come here to feed, and in the winter the northern lights dance.\nWe visit a small, family-run company producing dried salt cod. They export all over the world, but find the market for their fermented shark is, unsurprisingly, very small indeed.\nAfter watching Eider ducks on the still mill pond, and feeding the indigenous and protected Icelandic horses, we visit a flourishing micro-brewery – beer has only been legal in Iceland since 1989 and the locals are clearly making up for lost time.\nOn our last day, we leave Reykjavik and drive to the perfectly located Northern Lights Hotel on the southern peninsula, close to the volcanically heated Blue Lagoon.\nWe share the warm waters with more tourists than we have seen in the past seven days.\nThat night, after dinner, we sit in the Northern Lights observation tower.\nWith only a few hours of darkness we are too late in the season for the lights, but we watch the night glow golden over the lava field as the sun finally sets on our incredible Icelandic adventure.\nTAKE A TRIP TO IDYLLIC ICELAND Regent Holidays ( regent-holidays.co.uk , 020 7666 1290) offers a seven night ‘Glorious North Iceland’ fly-drive itinerary from £1,495 pp including return flights with Icelandair, hotels on B&B basis, Culinary & Coastlines excursion and comfort package at Blue Lagoon.\nOptional excursions to the Ice Cave or Golden Circle by Super Jeep from £199pp.\nRead more: Safaris, holidays & adventures to Africa | Expert Africa 500 Error | Regent Holidays", "external_links": ["http://regent-holidays.co.uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1X0aHQy", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-30T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:28:41.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
