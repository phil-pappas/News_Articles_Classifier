Though Canadian couples and families will not be surprised that Mexico comes in as the cheapest vacation spot for most 7-day trips.\n\"Canadians are looking to save on travel now more than ever, and we're not sure they're aware just how cheap some destinations around the world can be,\" said Don Power , Marketing Director for DiscountMyFlights.ca . \"Countries like Vietnam , Cambodia and India , while quite far away, can be incredibly affordable and offer a fascinatingly different culture than what most Canadians are used to on one or two week vacations.\"\nThe tool is available and free to use for all Canadians, and will be updated annually to account for changes in currency, flight prices and other fluctuations.\nAbout DiscountMyFlights.ca\nFounded in 2014, DiscountMyFlights.ca is an emerging online travel agency in Canada with only one mission: help Canadians find the absolute cheapest price online.
