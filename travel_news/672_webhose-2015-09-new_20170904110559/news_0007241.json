More than half a million seats were booked in one day alone, as customers flocked to book their spring and early summer sun for 2016. Sales increased from all over the world with increased numbers not only booking in Europe but also through easyJet’s Chinese and US homepages.\nAt one point, the airline was booking more than 800 seats per minute – the equivalent of filling five planes.\nThe number of passengers choosing to book using their mobile devices also doubled year on year which is a reflection of the airline’s leading digital products which have evolved significantly in recent years making it faster and easier than ever to book wherever people are. easyJet’s app is the fastest travel app on the market and has won a series of awards including best B2C app from Travolution, overall GrandPrix from “Marketing on Mobile” and finalists in the coveted “most innovative app” at Mobile World Congress.\nPeter Duffy, easyJet’s Commercial Director, commented:\n“Our busiest booking day usually takes place during our January sale so the success of last week’s summer schedule release is testament to the attractiveness of easyJet’s leading European network into the major airports customers want to fly to. We are seeing more and more customers booking early to make sure they can guarantee seats into the best airports, at the best times and the best prices, that only easyJet can offer. More and more mobile bookings is testament to our digital service which leads the market and makes it easier than ever for customers to book this way.”\nSince the launch of easyJet’s first iPhone app in 2011 the app has evolved from easy booking and check-in functionality to include popular features like passport scanning, live flight tracking, mobile boarding passes and Touch ID fingerprint technology to retrieve customer information. It is also now complimented by the innovative easyJet Apple Watch app.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:38:36.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
