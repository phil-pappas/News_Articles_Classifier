The injunction also prohibits blocking and hindering traffic on airport roadways.\nAfter several weeks of random protests on the Airport Parkway, including incidents of violence, harassment, and complete roadway blockages, the Airport Authority filed an application for clarification on our injunction. In the face of overwhelming evidence in support of the injunction requested by both the City and the Airport Authority, the union agreed to a settlement with the City on its injunction application. We are pleased that Justice Beaudoin confirmed in court today that the Airport Authority’s original injunction includes no blocking or hindrance of access to the airport. Justice Beaudoin also issued a further injunction to the City as per the settlement agreement, to clarify the matter once and for all.\nIn keeping with the Airport Authority’s commitment to safety and security, it is imperative that the roadways into the airport remain free and clear of all impediments to ensure direct and quick access for emergency vehicles. We are pleased that the City worked together with us in this matter to ensure safety and security at the airport.\nSource:- Ottawa International Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:39:05.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
