Published on : Saturday, September 12, 2015\nCanadian airline Air Canada Rouge will launch three flights per week between Toronto Pearson International Airport and Budapest as of next June. The largest Canadian carrier will operate the direct flight during the summer period, and will fly the route with 280-seater Boeing 767-300ER type aircraft.\nThe first Air Canada Rouge flight from Toronto is due to touch down at Budapest Airport on Friday 10 June 2016, with a Boeing 767-300ER type aircraft offering 24 business and 256 economy class seats. It is no coincidence that the Canadian metropolis is featured in Budapest Airport’s route network, as it is home to the largest population of Hungarian origin in Canada. In addition, not only family, but business relations are also developing dynamically between the two countries. Canada is the tenth largest foreign investor in the Hungarian economy.\nThe new Air Canada Rouge flight will initially operate during the summer season, i.e. until 15 October 2016. As a member of the Star Alliance airline association, Air Canada not only offers transfer options within Canada in Toronto, but also to numerous other destinations in Northern and Central America, such as New York Newark, Denver and virtually all Caribbean holiday destinations, including Varadero in Cuba.\n“I am very proud to welcome this new flight by Air Canada Rouge in the portfolio of Budapest Airport. Let me first of all congratulate the teams of both Air Canada and Budapest Airport for making this new route a reality,” said Jost Lammers, the CEO of Budapest Airport. He added: “This new flight will connect not only Canadian, but also a series of other North American destinations for travelers from Budapest, both in the business and leisure segment. I am sure that the new route will be a huge success in itself between Toronto and Budapest, but it also has an additional value in offering a series of transfer possibilities through other Star Alliance member airlines.”\nAir Canada Rouge was launched in December 2012, specifically to serve leisure destinations, primarily tourist resorts in Central America, the Caribbean, on the west coast of the United States and popular holiday and leisure destinations in Europe. Together with regional airline Air Canada Express, the company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Air Canada, the largest Canadian airline. Air Canada Rouge currently has a fleet of 34 aircraft, 20 Airbus A319-100s and 14 Boeing 767-300ERs, but another 5 Airbus A321-200s will start to arrive as of December this year. Air Canada Rouge flights also operate under the flight numbers of the parent company (AC), but marked “operated by Air Canada Rouge”, and the aircraft livery also differs from that of Air Canada.\nSource:- Budapest Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T04:14:05.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
