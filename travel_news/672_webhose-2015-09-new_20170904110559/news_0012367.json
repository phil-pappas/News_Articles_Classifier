We have two small children and would like a spare bed for guests so are hoping for at at least 3 bedrooms, preferable 4-5. Would prefer a house to an apartment, furnished, and just the right distance from the beach (close enough to be convenient to get there but not so close that we are constantly surrounded by partying tourists). Does anyone know of any good resources for our search? I'm finding lots of shorter term vacation rental websites but not much for someone looking to stay for several months or more.
