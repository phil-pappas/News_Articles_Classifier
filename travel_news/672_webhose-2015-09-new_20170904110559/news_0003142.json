Airport officials reported some flight delays.\nPeople faced breathing difficulties and were admitted in hospitals as the city was blanketed in yellow sand.\nThe unseasonal storm hit Jordan, Israel and Egypt. Many schools were shut down or cut shot due to the storm in Jordan.\nThe storm has reached the Lebanese capital as it completely covered the Bekaa Valley. Those with health issues have been advised to stay indoors and those who have to venture out are advised to use surgical masks. Almost 750 people in Lebanon have suffered breathing problems.\nPoor weather has disrupted organised protests that were taking place in the streets for piled up rubbish on Beirutthat that the authorities had warned residents against burning.\nMore than 1,200 people, including 100 children, had been treated with breathing problems in the Syrian capital, Damascus.
