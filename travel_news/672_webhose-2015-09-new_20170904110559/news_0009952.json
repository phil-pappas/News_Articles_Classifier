As detailed in Experian Marketing Services' Q2 2015 Email Benchmark Report , these email campaigns drove 22 percent higher revenue per email, a 46 percent increase in transaction rates and a 117 percent increase in transaction-to-click rates. \"Allowing customers to choose their preferred path is a smart and tangible way to increase engagement and ultimately their return on marketing investment,\" said Spencer Kollas , vice president of global deliverability services at Experian Marketing Services. \"Marketers know that consumers are the ones in control of their relationship today. What's interesting about the trend our research uncovered is that consumers are responding to brands that explicitly give them that control; they are engaging and spending with brands that are taking action to empower them.\" Value of mobile subscribers The Q2 2015 Email Benchmark Report features a special section on mobile subscribers that features the results of two analyses of two brands with ongoing SMS (mobile push) and MMS (mobile text) messaging programs. To conduct the analyses, Experian Â® attributed the brands' transactions to their mobile campaign data on a subscriber level. In comparing mobile transaction rates to email benchmark data, Experian found that mobile transaction rates were more than 10 times higher than those for email campaigns. Further, SMS push/broadcast campaigns made up more than 95 percent of the volume, but pull messages provided much stronger transaction results. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:08:37.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
