After doing a little digging around on the Airbnb website, Corwin found that his room had been listed - by his flatmate. \nNeedless to say the flatmate was kicked out not too long after the incident, but Corwin still wants answers. \nAirbnb reportedly told Corwin, \"Airbnb does not own, operate, manage or control accommodations, nor do we verify private contract terms or arbitrate complaints from third parties.\" \nThis isn't the first time Airbnb has hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons. \nIn April, 2015 a couple who rented out their house on Airbnb returned to find it had been trashed, in what Canadian police described as a \"drug-induced orgy\". \nMark and Star King said they were almost knocked over by the fumes when they walked into their home, in Sage Hill, north-west Calgary, after a weekend away. \nThey were then confronted with the destruction. \nTheir furniture had been destroyed, smashed glass littered the floor, and piles of cigarette butts, food and rubbish were strewn throughout the house. \nThe toilet was flooded and mustard, mayonnaise and sauce were smeared across the walls and floors. \nDo you have a horror Airbnb story to share?
