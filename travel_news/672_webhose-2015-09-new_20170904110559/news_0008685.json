Africa offers a rich variety of cultural experiences, there is nothing quite like it. Arguably, it’s an exquisite blend of the good, the bad and the ugly. The travel culture within the continent has yet to be completely embraced by Africans. \nIn many cases, these myths keep several travellers from exploring Africa. Jovago.com brings you five popular myths that not only hinder optimal exploration of Africa but also perpetuate a culture of ignorance around the world. \nAfrica is a country - This is probably the oldest of the misconceptions about Africa, with its fifty-four countries and diverse people. It remains a wonder how certain people are still of the perception that Africa is a country. Within its geographical space, the African continent can contain the United States, China, India, Eastern Europe amongst others. That certainly alludes to its vastness. \nAll Africans are poor - The first reaction to this is probably “ Really? ”. Indeed some Africans are poor as some Europeans and Asians however this is not the case for all Africans. That is buttressed by the fact that Africa has a vastly growing middle class. It is worthy of note that more could be done about the distribution of wealth to minimize the gap between the rich and poor. \nAfricans are mean and scary - This is quite the painful generalization, fortunately young people across Africa are doing a good job of breaking this stereotype. \nAfrica is not serene - Of course the rate of globalization is rendering Africa more urban however, in the \nmidst of all the hustle and bustle lies so much serenity… Just have a look at the Simien Mountains of Ethiopia. \nAbout Jovago \nJovago.com is an online hotel booking service with offices in Lagos (Nigeria), Nairobi (Kenya), Dakar (Senegal) founded by Africa Internet Group and has MTN and Millicom as investors.
