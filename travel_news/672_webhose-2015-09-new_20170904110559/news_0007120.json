Her extensive knowledge of project and design management, and site supervision ensured that work was finished to a high-standard.”\nSimona Giannelli, head of global retail programme at Maserati, added: ”We have a strong relationship with Turner & Townsend, following their work for us on a number of projects in China and the US. This made the company a natural choice.\n“Turner & Townsend understood our commitment to offering luxury to our customers, which extends into the feel and look of our showrooms. The consultancy’s thorough research on Korean suppliers allowed us to bring down the costs of using high-quality materials.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:24:09.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
