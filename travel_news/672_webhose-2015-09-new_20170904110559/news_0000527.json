The build was held at LVS' Singapore, Macao, Bethlehem and Las Vegas properties sequentially and all within a 24-hour period on Saturday, starting at Marina Bay Sands, LVS' property in Singapore, at 9 a.m. locally and culminating at 6 p.m. Pacific Time in Las Vegas. The effort was part of LVS's global corporate citizenship program, Sands Cares, and its ongoing partnership with Clean the World. \n\"Through this ambitious global Sands Cares event, we are helping hundreds of thousands of people without access to hygiene supplies to help them stay healthy,\" said Ron Reese, senior vice president of corporate communications at LVS. \"Today showed the amazing impact people can have by uniting around a single mission.\" \nEach hygiene kit contains soap and other hygiene items collected from Clean the World's hospitality partners, including LVS properties globally. Soap is recycled through Clean the World's sanitation and processing equipment and packed with other amenities, such as shampoo, conditioner, a toothbrush and toothpaste, to form individual personal care kits. \nThe global event was underwritten by LVS and also received support from Sysco. LVS and Clean the World have a strong partnership built upon a collective commitment to help people in need while protecting the planet. Since 2011, LVS and Clean the World have recycled more than 50 tons of waste from LVS properties into more than 550,000 bars of soap. \n\"Today's accomplishment illustrates the collective commitment of Las Vegas Sands and Clean the World to make our world healthier through sustainable solutions that address and solve social ills. A global build of this magnitude makes far-reaching impact, providing reclaimed hygiene supplies to people and places we normally can't reach – a win for people and a win for the planet,\" said Shawn Seipler, founder and CEO of Clean the World. \nLVS' partnership with Clean the World is part of the company's global corporate citizenship program, Sands Cares. Announced in April 2014, Sands Cares manifests the company's core corporate social responsibility focus: supporting people in the company and the hospitality industry, making local communities where LVS operates a better place to live and reducing environmental impact on the planet. Sands Cares unites corporate and property-level giving in communities where LVS operates to address the most pressing issues in local communities and make them better places to live.
