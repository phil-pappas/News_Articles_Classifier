Being single is synonymous with freedom, but on the flip-side, very few men look forward to a lifetime spent alone. Thankfully, there are many destinations for a single vacation where a guy can tackle this conundrum on his own terms, in due time, but always after a hot experience in paradise. Here are five places that are custom-made for a singles holiday.Medellin, Colombia:Made for: Adventure-seekers, and romanticsThe draw: Endless jungles, and seduction as a cultureThe terrain surrounding this ancient city is one of the most diverse in Colombia and a great vacation for singles. It has tall mountain peaks, jungle highlands and lowlands, deep gorges and canyons, and amazingly hypnotic farming areas. Every type of terrain offers the opportunity for extreme guided excursions. Places like the Abbura Valley are unmatched in the world for seasonal color. Temesis offers endurance hikes and waterfall rappelling only minutes from the city. Of course, there are thousands of private places like Los Katios National Park, where the jungle meets a crystal clear pool, perhaps with a cave or hot spring. This is the ideal spot for a single guy to entertain a lovely local girl, or fellow traveler in a dream-like setting.Rio De Janeiro, BrazilMade for: Fit men who can dance and who crave noiseThe draw: 24 hour socializing and partiesParty Mecca for single men is Carnival, and Rio is its home base. Almost all year long, people in this city throw back the curtains for tourists. This is especially true for single guys who are extremely comfortable with leaving their self-loathing behind the moment the step off the plane. Festa (Portuguese for feast/celebration), is ingrained in Brazilian culture. In the ancient world, all roads led to Rome. In Rio, all roads lead to the beach, or a world class nightclub. There are the classics like Ipanema and the Copacabana, but other venues are becoming popular, especially if you have a favorite beach activity. Praia Vermelha is a surf hub, and Praia da Barra da Tijuca is famous for motor sports and parasailing. After working on the tan,go for dancing, drinks, and booty-watching at clubs like Leviano with its massive mosh pit, and Casa Rosa for laser-lit, edgy interaction. Rio might well be the perfect place for singles to holiday.Bangkok, ThailandMade for: Urban-oriented, tryst addictsThe draw: Food, adult entertainment, and more foodMen from all over the world find Bangkok to be a fascinating study in opposites. There's no argument that adult entertainment in all forms is a major draw, but local laws and customs must be respected at all times. It's absolutely possible to find any type of entertainment that you want, but it must be enjoyed on the culture's terms. Bangkok is like a single traveller's fantasy theme park, but definitely...ahem, lives up to its name. The people of Bangkok are exotic creatures in familiar westernized, U.S. and Euro-style packages. They are very accommodating to the expectations of single male tourists, and have the inviting currency exchange rate to boot. Restaurants like Xing Fu satisfy a guy's stomach. Fitness and outdoor gyms help a guy retain his muscle tone while away from home. Elephant riding in the Khoa Yi National Park provides opportunities for selfies to make friends jealous. Adult clubs, lounges and hotel concierge like will certainly where out a single guy's eyes (if not his entire body). As a single guy wrestles with the notion of settling-down in life, he can get the \"wildness\" out in this huge bachelor party of a destination. Ibiza, SpainMade for: History-lovers, mermenThe draw: Genuine locals, The MediterraneanIbiza is an island getaway steeped in old world culture including religion, sport, and cuisine. The deepest blue imaginable comes from an interface with the Mediterranean Sea, and the deepest brown is found in the eyes, hair and skin of some of Europe's most alluring women making it the dream holiday for singles. A network of inviting villages each have town centers emerging from a catholic chapel like the Capilla de la Virgen de Lourdes, or a school or monastery. As far as social activities, anything having to do with playing on the sand or in the water is available. This area is very family friendly, so singles fun remains extremely intimate and low key. Single men should try offering a lonely local girl a glass of wine followed by a conversation on art, and a paddle board session afterward.Cancun, MexicoMade for: Penny-pinchers, beach bumsThe draw: Oceanside recreation, tequila, tansThis resort city is obviously popular with the college Spring Break crowd for reasons that also appeal to any single man. Every dinner plate, public transport, cabana, fishing charter, beach chair rental, and bottle of Jose Cuervo is affordable. This means single guys in every stage of life can find a way to have fun. Spend a few days hiking in the Yucatan inland camping near the Chichen Itza Pyramid, then join a beach rave with some new Mexican friends for the rest of the trip.For more ideas on vacations for single men click singlementravel website.
