But Celebrity Cruises is flipping the script on a series of new Caribbean sailings that will include overnight port stays. The company previously announced two such itineraries and is expanding them to a total of 43 sailings in 2016 and 2017.\nEvery Caribbean cruise 10 nights or longer will offer an overnight in port. A special series of optional nighttime excursions, called Evenings Around the World (from $45), include nocturnal carriage rides in Cartagena, Colombia; a tasting at a winery in Willemstad, Curaçao; and a sunset small-boat cruise with live music in Aruba. Using the ship as a hotel, passengers can freely use the extended hours to independently explore night life in the ports. Fares for cruises that include the overnights start at $898 per person.\nNEW VERMONT BASE CAMP\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section. ‘Star Wars’: Coming to a Theme Park Near You SEP 29 Hotel and Resort News: Surfing in Hawaii; Art in Uruguay SEP 29 London Gets in the Halloween Spirit SEP 28 On the Amalfi Coast, Music of Sinatra and Chopin SEP 28 Air Travel News: Dominica Flights; United Cocktails SEP 28", "external_links": ["http://www.celebritycruises.com/home"], "published": "2015-09-30T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T15:55:15.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
