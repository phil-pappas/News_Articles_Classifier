The lifestyle select property, which will be located adjacent to Scotland’s largest exhibition centre, will feature 176 rooms and will welcome its first guests in 2017. It ideally complements Carlson Rezidor’s existing portfolio in Glasgow: the group already operates a Radisson Blu and a Park Inn by Radisson in the city. \n“Following the recent Carlson Rezidor signings of Radisson Red hotels in Asia (Shenyang Hunan; China) and Africa (Cape Town; South Africa), we are proud to announce the first new-build property in Europe. Glasgow is one of the strongest markets in the UK, and Radisson Red will add a vibrant new concept to the city’s hospitality sector. Inspired by the millennial lifestyle trends, the brand addresses the highly connected and design savvy world traveller”, said Wolfgang M. Neumann, President & CEO of Rezidor. “The Radisson Red Hotel Glasgow will be a flagship and strengthen the brand’s strategic roll-out in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and across the globe. Set for ambitious growth in urban locations, Radisson Red targets 60+ hotels worldwide by the year 2020”, added Elie Younes, Executive Vice President & Chief Development Officer of Rezidor. Marc Finney, Colliers International Head of Hotel & Resorts Consulting, who provided a Market & Financial Feasibility study for the hotel, commented: “We are delighted to assist our client with bringing forward this innovative development that will be an important addition to the hotel stock in Glasgow. It is an excellent location, and the product, being the first of its kind in the UK, will set a new standard in the city. Bringing together high quality investors-developers and leading international brands is what we do at Colliers.” The site of the Radisson Red Hotel Glasgow is in the city’s West End, only 300m away from the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) that includes the Clyde Auditorium for 3,000 guests and the Hydro concert arena with 12,500 seats. Also the International Financial Services District, the Glasgow Science Centre and the Glasgow Media Centre are in close proximity to the hotel. The city centre and international airport are 2km and 10km away, respectively. Besides 176 guest rooms, the Radisson Red will comprise a stylish “Redeli” restaurant and a “Oui” bar; a gallery; more than 100sqm of meeting space; a gym; and 78 parking spaces. With a population of 1.75 million, Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland and is also the UK’s leading city of finance outside of London and one of Europe’s top ten financial centres. It is also known as a major tourist destination attracting more than 2.3 million visitors per year.
