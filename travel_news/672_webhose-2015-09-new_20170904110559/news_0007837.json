Asia-Pacific region is expected to become the major market for the manufacture of these systems with India and China stepping ahead towards becoming automotive component manufactures hubs and sourcing to countries such as US and Germany . Koito Manufacturing Co. Ltd, Adaptive Lighting, ZKW Group and HELLA KGaA Hueck & Co. are some of the key players in the manufacture of these systems. Magneti Marelli came up with the new technology of Adaptive Rear Lamp system (ARS), which works on a similar principle as that of front lamps, but to adjust the tail lamp intensity, based on the brake force and even for the adaptive reverse motion function. OSRAM GmbH has been working on the lighting systems for AFS assembly and came up with the high-power compact LEDs, which are now a component of the AFS in the new CLS class of Mercedes. BMW recently has developed its own adaptive lighting system and launched the new 5 series, employing this technology. The overall market for Adaptive lighting system looks very favorable with many mid to high-end passenger car manufacturers seeking for better driver assistance systems.\nHighest fatal traffic accident rates on curved roads and limited maneuverability of the static head light systems are the major drivers propelling the global adaptive lighting system market. Restrictions on Xenon lamps in some countries such as India , high cost of R&D and unorganized aftermarket dominated by local players, are a major concern for the market. However, development of latest High Intensity Discharge (HID) projector lamp systems, improved sensor technology, major players partnering with domestic players and booming automobile passenger vehicle segment are expected to create a major opportunity for investment in the sector.\nKeeping the passengers safe and providing the driver a world class driving experience had become the main agenda of the middle-high end passenger car manufacturers. Starting from ABS, EBS to the present day Auto-Cruise control systems, automotive manufacturers made their search for advanced driver assistance systems a prime target. Adaptive lighting system, also called the automotive adaptive front-lighting system (AFS) is one such effort as a part of active safety system (ASS). This head light assembly involves a set of sophisticated parts including a rotating headlamp and high-end sensor systems, which are operated by a master controller. The market was segmented based on the latest technologies, by component type, by assembly position and by geography.\nWhy buy this report?\nThis report on automotive adaptive lighting systems, analyzes the current market trends on a global and region scale in detail.\nThis report offers the technical aspects and economic data of the market and its forecast to the next 5 years (2015-2020).\nIt also discusses the latest technologies in the automotive lighting systems that are under development and in research pipeline.\nThis report provides the list of major players in the market and gives an in depth analyst perspective of what makes the products and strategies of these players stand out from the pack.\nRead the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p03281820-summary/view-report.html\nAbout Reportlinker\nReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.
