For example:\nHavana : Cuba's colorful capital is popular for its exciting collection of Spanish-influenced castles, cathedrals, mansions and museums, and may be best known for historic Old Havana, a UNESCO World Heritage site with more than 900 landmarks. One of the most culturally rich urban centers in the world and once home to Ernest Hemingway , Havana features a lively music and entertainment scene, an eclectic mix of inspirational museums and art galleries, some of the world's best ballet schools and dance companies, and much more. Cienfuegos: Considered an architectural jewel of French influence and known as \"the Pearl of the South,\" this city is popular among diving enthusiasts for an undersea maze of coral columns along the coastline called Notre Dame . Among its many attractions, Cienfuegos boasts an imposing fortress – Castillo de Jagua – built to protect the city from attacks and widely recognized as one of Cuba's most important military structures. Santiago de Cuba : Cuba's second-largest city, Santiago de Cuba is infused with a distinctly Caribbean spirit. The traditional site of two popular festivities – Carnaval and the Fiesta del Fuego – the city encompasses a diverse assortment of architectural influences, from the El Morro castle (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), to the Parque Céspedes in the bustling historic quarter, to the glorious Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre, Cuba's most sacred pilgrimage site. The Cuban itinerary provided has been designed in full compliance with U.S. Department of Treasury rules that allow licensed travel companies to transport travelers to Cuba to engage in activities that support the Cuban people and Fathom is working to finalize the details around the proposed itinerary with its partners.\nFathom travelers will sail aboard the 710-passenger MV Adonia where they may take part in robust onboard experiences customized to this unique travel encounter, including specialized retail focused on empowering purpose-driven businesses and entrepreneurs and culturally and geographically relevant music and film options, as well as Cuban inspired menu options.\nSpecial onboard programming will include a wide variety of activities covering an array of interests, ranging from an orientation to the country's history, customs and culture, to casual fun personal enrichment activities, to conversational Spanish lessons, to guided sessions with the Fathom team to share insights, ideas, and opportunities about the future of cultural exchange travel to Cuba.\nFathom Also Begins Sailing to Dominican Republic in April 2016\nIn addition, beginning in April 2016 , Fathom will begin sailing Amber Cove , a new port in the Dominican Republic and the company's first social impact destination.

Fathom collaborated with diverse Dominican stakeholders including Dominican community leaders, Dominican officials and leaders of top local non-profits with deep roots in the country to identify activities that would have the greatest impact on people's lives and make lasting contributions to the community.\nPrices for the seven-day trips to the Dominican Republic start at $974 per person, excluding taxes, fees and port expenses and including all meals on the ship, onboard social impact immersion experiences, three on-shore social impact activities and related supplies.
