This marks the fourth consecutive year that CN has been listed on the DJSI World Index and the seventh consecutive year that CN has been listed on the DJSI North America Index.\nThe DJSI follows a best-in-class approach, surveying sustainability leaders from each industry on a global and regional level. The annual review of the DJSI family is based on a thorough analysis of economic, environmental and social performance, assessing issues such as corporate governance, risk management, climate change mitigation, supply chain standards, stakeholder engagement and labour practices.\nJim Vena , executive vice-president and chief operating officer of CN, said: \"Our sustainability agenda integrates our activities and shapes our thinking in a way that allows us to go further. CN leads the North American rail industry in fuel efficiency, consuming 15 per cent less fuel per gross-ton-mile overall than our peers. This important recognition highlights our ongoing commitment to operating a safe and environmentally responsible railroad.\"\nCN's sustainability achievements are also marked by its ongoing commitment to its \"EcoConnexions – From the Ground Up\" program, which since 2012 has sponsored tree-planting projects in 85 communities. In combination with a mass reforestation program, this has resulted in over one million trees being planted across Canada and the U.S.\nThe DJSI World Index selects for inclusion the top 10 per cent of the 2,500 largest companies in the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index from each sector based on their sustainability score.\nLaunched in 1999, the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes are the first global indexes tracking the financial performance of the leading, sustainability-driven companies. The indices serve as benchmarks for investors who integrate sustainability considerations into their portfolios, and provide an effective engagement platform for companies who want to adopt sustainable best practices.\nCN is a true backbone of the economy, transporting more than C$250 billion worth of goods annually for a wide range of business sectors, ranging from resource products to manufactured products to consumer goods, across a rail network spanning Canada and mid-America, from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to the Gulf of Mexico .
