Nonprofits expect to receive requests from parents for assistance into the fall.\nTalk to people involved in this meaningful cause, and they will likely describe the way children’s faces light up when they are given something to call their own.\nLast week, Hopelink saved its clients a trip and some gas money by distributing school supplies at its Kirkland food bank during distribution hours.\n A working single mother minded the family’s grocery cart as her three kids eagerly chose from an array of backpack colors.\nHer daughter, 12, picked a gray backpack and was excited she won’t have to ask peers for basic things such as pencils and paper.\nA younger brother, 10, couldn’t wait to go home to examine the contents. He unzipped the backpack and took a peek at the notebooks and folders inside.\nAnd as the 11-year-old middle child threw his backpack over his shoulder and adjusted the straps, he looked up and said, “This is cool, mom.”\nSuch enthusiasm is made possible in part by the generosity of Seattle Times readers.\nThe editorial board’s annual school supply drive continues through Monday. All proceeds will be split among Hopelink, YWCA Seattle King Snohomish and the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness.\nA little assistance with school supplies might mean that a family has a little more money to pay for bills and other back-to-school expenses.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A. Blethen, Ryan Blethen, Brier Dudley, Mark Higgins, Jonathan Martin, Thanh Tan, Blanca Torres, William K. Blethen (emeritus) and Robert C.
