In an interview with Glamour UK , the Bride Wars star opened up about what it’s like to be at the older end of the age spectrum in Tinseltown.\n“I can’t complain about it because I benefited from it,” she admits. “When I was in my early 20s, parts would be written for women in their 50s and I would get them. And now I’m in my early 30s and I’m like, ‘Why did that 24-year-old get that part?’”\nOther Stories Tomic downs brave Hewitt in five Tennis 0 comments ‘My husband and I haven’t had sex in a year’ Relationships Bennett slams ‘hypocritical’ players Nrl 0 comments Greek model saves drowning refugee World 0 comments Take his name and you’ll be called ‘actor’s wife’ Rendezview 0 comments Podcast: How Justin Bieber told Alli he had a crush on her Sydney Confidential 0 comments Hathaway got her first big break playing an awkward teenage royal in 2001’s The Princess Diaries . She then went on to star in The Devil Wears Prada opposite Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt in 2006.\n“I was that 24-year-old once, I can’t be upset about it, it’s the way things are,” she said. “All I can do right now is think that thankfully you have built up perhaps a little bit of cachet and can tell stories that interest you and if people go to see them you’ll be allowed to make more.”\nAnne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey starred together in Interstellar, 2014. Hollywood’s ageism has been a contentious topic of late. Earlier this year, Maggie Gyllenhaal revealed that, at 37, she was considered too old to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man.\nRussell Crowe made headlines in January over comments he made about actresses who complain about ageist casting. “If you are willing to live in your own skin, you can work as an actor,” he argued. “If you are trying to pretend that you’re still the young buck when you’re my age, it just doesn’t work.”\nDame Helen Mirren, Meryl Streep and Julie Walters have also spoken out about the lack of substantial parts available on stage and screen for older women.\nMeryl Streep and Anne Hathaway in 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada.
