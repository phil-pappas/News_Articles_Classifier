Diners sip glasses of Lodi Zinfandel among the rows of fragrant produce and an overhead tapestry of umbrellas and strung lights. \n“It’s casual, romantic and old-charm Italian,” said Jim Murdaca , Pietro’s Trattoria owner and chef. “It’s like dining in your backyard. You can reach over, grab a tomato and eat it.” \nWith its stone fireplace, sandy-colored stucco walls and linen-topped tables, raised beds of bell peppers, trellises of tomatoes, grapevines and flower beds, the courtyard does have the inviting vibe of Italy. Basil is a restaurant staple, used to garnish Strawberry Basil Martinis and flavor the red sauces for seafood risotto and veal scaloppine. Plump bell peppers, fragrant after a day in the valley sun, are roasted and mixed with diced salami, cheese, olives, white beans and romaine lettuce in the chopped antipasto salad. The homegrown sage adds an herbaceous twist to the prosciutto-topped veal saltimbocca, a Pietro’s favorite. \nFresh ingredients are harvested three times a week from the plants growing outside the kitchen door, just as they were at his family’s Vacaville restaurant, also named Pietro’s, that opened in 1956 and is still owned by his brother, Joe Murdaca . \nJim Murdaca is mostly self-taught in the kitchen, but his Italian heritage is the motivation behind Pietro’s Trattoria in Lodi, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary. The restaurant’s interior is warm, with golden archways and Italian memorabilia, including photographs of three generations of the Murdacas and their travels to Italy. \nBut what charms most diners are the gardens: the rosebushes along Kettleman Lane, the citrus trees lining the restaurant’s perimeter, the raised beds along the parking lot and inside the courtyard. \n“It’s a nice change of pace from the cluster of restaurants downtown,” said Kelli Perrault , a Lodi native. “It’s nice to be able to smell the fresh basil before it gets to the table.” \nThe gardens were created in 2011 by Stockton landscape architect Jeff Gamboni , along with Murdaca and his wife, Annette. \nNow they are maintained by garden enthusiast Linda Looper , who has a business teaching people how to start and maintain gardens. \nEarlier this year, Looper approached the restaurant with a basket of organic vegetables and herbs, and an offer to give Pietro’s garden and courtyard a face-lift. \nShe started by studying the dirt, removing any rotting fruit, and thinning out sunburned or discolored leaves. She amended the soil with aged organic compost loaded with nutrients from forest humus, mushroom compost and sandy loam — a mixture that has been heated to 180 degrees, ensuring that there is no odor. Organic seeds from the nearby Delta Tree Nursery are now strong, producing plants. \nWith the summer heat and the drought, the garden is watered with an underground irrigation system in the early morning and late evening on designated days of the week. Looper says the rich soil retains enough moisture to sustain most of the plants during the harsh heat, though she hand-waters with a watchful eye. The restaurant staff also saves water from customers’ glasses to water the crops. \nUsing the technique of companion planting, Looper grouped herbs and vegetables by height, sun position and pest prevention, and recently turned loose 4,500 ladybugs to eat aphids and white flies. She planted the most fragrant herbs and plants where their aromas could be picked up by the evening breeze and sent drifting through the courtyard. \n“This fresh, locally grown produce actually smells as good as it tastes,” Looper said. \nThe freshness is what gives Pietro’s its farm-to-fork appeal and keeps the restaurant busy, whether diners are sipping Pinot Grigio under umbrellas on a hot day or cozied up to the fireplace in the wintertime. \nThe Murdacas, with Looper’s help, are preparing to plant their second garden of the year. The tomato plants and peppers will be replaced with beds of winter crops. Spinach and Swiss chard will be used in winter soups and sauces. Snap peas and Italian parsley will be used for garnish across the menu, while broccoli will be grown for pasta dishes, and homegrown beans will star in winter salads. \nIt’s like a true Italian garden, Murdaca says. “Everything we plant should produce something.” \nPietro’s Trattoria: 317 E. Kettleman Lane, Lodi; (209) 368-0613. www.pietroslodi.com. Lunch and dinner Monday-Saturday. \nLauren Nelson is a freelance writer.
