Dubbed a \"festival with a difference\", The Good Life Experience offers up a weekend retreat in Wales themed around the values and fashions that many associate with \"the good old days.\" Here are a selection of highlights from the weekend, including a 70s punk music legend and lessons in loafing around. Wilko Johnson British punk pioneer Wilko Johnson Expect his trademark \"duck walk\", coupled with his signature \" punchy, scattergun riffs which blazed a trail for British punk \" from Dr. Feedgood guitarist Wilko Johnson when he graces the stage as weekend's headlining act. Recently having played to a sold out Royal Albert Hall ( alongside The Who ), Johnson is on top form, boasting clawhammer riffing that, according to Telegraph music critic Andrew Perry , could have rock legend Jimmy Page looking on in awe. The Idler Academy The eponymous educational offshoot of literary and philosophical magazine, The Idler , will offer a sneak peek of what they do at their school based in Notting Hill over The Good Life Experience weekend. With a desire to \"return dignity to the art of loafing, to make idling into something to aspire towards rather than reject\" The Idler team come prepared with lessons on philosophy, astronomy, calligraphy, and how to play the ukelele, amongst others. Tristan Gooley Take a bough: ?Navigation begins from the moment we wake up,? says Tristan Gooley Photo: Heathcliff Oâ€™Malley Described as a \" wholesome version of Indiana Jones \", Tristan Gooley, aka the Natural Navigator , will be on hand to provide expert advice on how to make most of nature, and explore your surroundings. The only living person to have both flown solo and sailed singlehanded across the Atlantic, Gooley advocates ditching GPS technology, preferring to take note of the clues and signs provided by the outdoors to find your bearings. Caught by the River An online forum for all things outdoors - angling, bird watching, walking and more - Caught by the River will contribute a line-up of authors, musicians and speakers to the weekend. Campfire Baking Learn how to harness the power of a campfire to make delicious and fresh bread Photo: Alamy Campfire meals needn't be reduced to burnt s'mores and lukewarm sausages. Young Baker of the Year winner Tom Herbert has \"lots of floury tricks\" up his sleeve, included teaching Good Life festival goers how to bake over the campfire, with \"bread, pizzas and passion\" listed as his ingredients of choice.
