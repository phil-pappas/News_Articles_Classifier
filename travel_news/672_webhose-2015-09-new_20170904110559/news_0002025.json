If you are exhilarated by the thought of strapping on your scuba gear and submerging yourself into crystal blue waters with the promise of seeing amazing sea creatures, then Italy should be at the top of your travel list. Not only does it offer divers some of the most amazing waters, but gives travellers plenty to do above ground as well. If you’re going to dive in Italy, here are the top three locations you should be checking out: \nPortofino, Liguria: Known as one of the swankiest pit stops in the Liguria area and home to many a prestigious yacht, this small coastal town is ideal for going scuba diving . Its deep seabeds are also home to many wonderful creatures and species of flora and fauna, and it is here you will be able to catch a glimpse of the Posidonia Oceanic Meadow, which hosts a special species of seagrass. But even on the surface, Portofino is something to see: a quaint and picturesque town with its ancient marina, small piazzas and brightly colored houses that make them easy to see from sea. And when you’re not exploring Portofino’s underworld, grab a large helping of Lasagna di Portofino, a pesto-based version of the classic. \nGulf of Orosei, Sardinia: Sardinia in and of itself is just absolutely gorgeous. One of Italy’s islands that could hardly have an \"unattractive\" spot, the Gulf of Orosei is the place to be if you want to go diving. Here we’re talking about the area between Cala Liberotto and Arbatax, with visibility between 50 and 100 feet and mild water temperatures. Due to the volcanic activity in the area, there are many wonderful volcanic rock formations to see in addition to barracudas, lobsters, starfish and stingray. If you decide to come up for a little air, spend some time on land on this area’s white sandy beaches surrounded by its wild nature. Or try the Selvaggio Blue hiking route, a challenging course that hugs the Gulf of Orosei. \nScopello, Sicily: A little hidden gem, this coastal town located on Italy’s island of Sicily, is a little village with a big history and one of Sicily’s oldest and most important tuna fisheries. It makes up 7km of breathtaking coastline and is a great little spot because it’s located next to Lo Zingaro Nature Reserve, opening up the possibility for a variety of underwater and above ground species. Places to check out on your dive would be the “Impisu wall” where you can see the red gorgonian, where the lobsters go to hide themselves. Or check out Lion Point, an overhang where you can catch a glimpse of some amazing fish. As for the town, take a step back in time with this tranquil village, off the beaten path. Here you can opt for the ultimate relaxing vacation: rent a villa , experience local cuisine and delicacies, and really rub elbows with the locals. \nIf you’re a diver and Italy is on your bucket list, get ready to scratch it off. Even if you’re a beginner, experience all these particular towns have to offer while taking your first-ever diving lesson.
