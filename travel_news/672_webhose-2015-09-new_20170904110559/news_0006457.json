The prognosis was six to eight weeks of rest, but as the months slipped past and it became clear that the ripped tendons were more damaged than at first feared, a new reality emerged: he could either hope for the best and wait for the ligament to repair itself, or he could go under the knife. With his first World Cup looming, the wing needed certainty above all else, so he opted for surgery on his damaged shoulder. “It was always going to be touch and go, but it’s worked out well,” said Maitland, who plays at full-back against France on Saturday night. • England vs Ireland: live (KO 2.30pm) • Wales vs Italy: live (KO 5pm) “I’ve been out for seven months, and there were times in the last nine weeks in particular when we had doubts, times when I thought, 'Man, I’m not going to make it’. “But over that time I’ve worked b hard with the physios and the rest of the staff to get back into shape. “And then suddenly you get to a point where you turn a corner and start going uphill. I don’t know what the exact turning point was, maybe it was just getting a bit of strength back in the weights room and gaining confidence from that. Paris match: Vern Cotter's men face a tough test against France on Saturday night “Two weeks ago I did a bit of tackling and surprised myself at how good it was. Then I saw the surgeon and he gave me the all-clear, that was the big difference.” Maitland’s intensive rehab regime alongside Alex Dunbar and Mark Bennett saw him miss out on Scotland’s boot camp in Fort Romeu in the Pyrenees. Yet despite his absence, he always knew that if he could prove his fitness, his quality and versatility would give him a better than evens chance of making the final 31. “I’m just incredibly grateful that Vern [Cotter] and the coaches have given me an opportunity to get back out there and have a run around,” he said. “To be honest, I didn’t know what the coaches were thinking, so for me the worry was always about getting back fit. “I’m just really grateful that I’ve been picked in the squad – and I know I have a point to prove this weekend. But it was always going to be close, given the deadline for selection. I always felt I would be ready a week or two before the World Cup, but it was always touch and go.” However, Maitland, who deputises for the injured Stuart Hogg on Saturday evening, is exactly the sort of balanced rugby player who has the pace and vision to play the heads-up wide game that Cotter would like to see as Scotland’s default mode. So, he was always a shoo-in for the side if he could prove his fitness. As chances come, making your comeback in a city where Scotland have not won since Gregor Townsend had hair, against a resurgent France side beginning to flex their muscles, should be daunting, but Maitland seems genuinely enthused at the prospect. “After seven months out I am just really excited, just fizzing to play and hoping for an entertaining game with a 'W’ at the end of it. These are the sort of challenges you play the game for, I can’t wait.” Telegraphsportpage Follow @telegraphsport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T16:45:30.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
