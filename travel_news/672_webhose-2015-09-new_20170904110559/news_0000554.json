Fractured jaw forces Jean de Villiers to end Springbok career Boks stay focused for Scotland game In this article Companies and organisations: Springboks Topics: Rugby World Cup NEWCASTLE — Jan Serfontein, devastated to have missed out in the initial World Cup selection, might be thrust straight into the Springbok starting line-up for Saturday’s Pool B encounter against Scotland.\nThe 22-year-old arrived in Newcastle on Monday afternoon as a replacement for former captain Jean de Villiers, who was ruled out of the tournament with a broken jaw and subsequently retired from Test rugby.\nWith an injury cloud also hanging over Damian de Allende, Serfontein is suddenly in pole position to start. He has played four Currie Cup matches for the Bulls in the past month and made one appearance for the Boks, off the bench, against Argentina.\nDe Allende confirmed the knee injury sustained during last weekend’s 46-6 win over Samoa was still lingering and that he would have more clarity later in the week.\n\"I can’t comment on my knee yet, I’m still in the process of getting it right,\" De Allende said.\n\"But it feels a lot better than it did at the weekend.\n\"Every player gets worried when they get a shot on the knee because it can be a devastating injury. I was concerned at half-time, but it’s definitely feeling better.\"\nDe Allende trained with the team at the Gateshead International Stadium, but didn’t take part in all the drills.\nSerfontein started 10 Tests last year and was the undoubted first choice, but an untimely knee injury in this year’s Super Rugby curtailed his season.\nAt the same time Jesse Kriel was thrust into the Test arena during the recent Rugby Championshipship and Serfontein fell further down the pecking order.\n\"I was surprised to get the call on Saturday,\" Serfontein said. \"I was watching the Wales versus England game when I received a call from coach Heyneke (Meyer). He told me Jean was injured and that he was considering picking me, but would only confirm on Sunday morning.\n\"I didn’t sleep well on Saturday, and on Sunday morning it was confirmed. I’m happy, even though it’s not ideal circumstances to come in to the team considering Jean’s injury — but I’m here now and I’m willing to do everything I can to contribute.\n\"I was very disappointed to miss out on initial World Cup selection. It was very tough.\n\"But I had a chance to get some game time in the Currie Cup and that has helped.\n\"I’ve had a difficult year with injuries at a bad time and Jesse Kriel took his chance when it came. But life takes strange twists and turns. Missing out on World Cup selection made me realise that there are so many players in your position that can do the job.\n\"That motivated me to work harder to be in the team. It’s not a nice place being on the outside.\"\nFlank Willem Alberts trained with the team for the first time in more than a week, and appears to be over a calf muscle strain. Scrumhalf Fourie du Preez showed no ill effects from a rib injury at the weekend, while Kriel also trained despite a black eye.\nPROBABLE SQUAD\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 JP Pietersen, 13 Jesse Kriel, 12 Jan Serfontein, 11 Bryan Habana, 10 Handré Pollard, 9 Fourie du Preez, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Schalk Burger, 6 Francois Louw, 5 Victor Matfield, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Jannie du Plessis, 2 Adriaan Strauss, 1 Beast Mtawarira.\nReplacements : 16 Bismarck du Plessis, 17 Trevor Nyakane, 18 Frans Malherbe, 19 Lood de Jager, 20 Willem Alberts, 21 Ruan Pienaar, 22 Pat Lambie, 23 Lwazi Mvovo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:49:49.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
