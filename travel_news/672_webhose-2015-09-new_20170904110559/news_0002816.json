Both The Sports Monitor and The Sports Eye have Basports.com solidly on top with a perfect 100% winning record. The gold standard of sports service monitors is Ruth Glasgow's The Sports Monitor , which has tracked handicapper performance since the 1980s. Of the many thousands of sports services, only about 150 will risk exposing their records publicly in contests such as those The Sports Monitor runs. Many of the rest, claiming 80-90% wins, are outright scams.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150924/270712LOGO\nIt's no surprise Bob Akmens is the best football handicapper again. Basports.com had the finest football handicapping season ever documented in 28 years by The Sports Monitor (TSM).
