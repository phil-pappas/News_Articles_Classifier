More than one million visitors came to see the 50 lions in the first year. Now there are 1,250 animals in the safari park and a ‘‘Jungle Kingdom” where animatronic dinosaurs stand among the enclosures of otters, lemurs, binturongs (funny, moustachioed tree-climbing animals) and more, plus an array of extra attractions from a stingray pool to a bat cave. We were there from 10am till 5pm but ran out of time, missing the house – the first stately home in the UK to open to visitors in 1949 – giraffe feeding, and the hedge maze.\nFun fact\nNico, a western lowland gorilla, is 54 this year: the second oldest gorilla in the world.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nico, a western lowland gorilla\nBest thing(s) about it\nFor little children getting up close to the smaller creatures is probably more exciting than seeing the bigger animals from the car. You can enter the lorikeet cage where the colourful birds perch on your arms and head as you hold out a paper cup of nectar (£1 a pot); walk alongside meerkats and waddling Humboldt penguins; hold giant snails, snakes and tarantulas in the Handling Hall. The biggest hit for my five-year old was the parrot show where various characters whistle, rollerskate, play football and basketball on command.\nI was impressed by the staff. We were allowed to take a second boat tour of the lake for free when my son missed out on feeding fish to the Californian sea lions the first time around. We saved the safari park for the afternoon when it’s less busy. Highlights for us were seeing wolves loping about the forest, feeding deer who poke their heads through your car window and watching monkeys scampering over vehicles – you can avoid the area if you are worried your aerial and windscreen wipers might get chewed off. Thankfully, our car emerged intact.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boat tours of Half Mile Lake, home to hippos, sea lion and Nico the elderly gorilla.\nWhat about lunch?\nFood is underwhelming and on the expensive side: a bottle of water costs £2.20. The Tropical Storm cafe is a big canteen-style restaurant with a deli counter selling paninis and hot food, such as lasagne and chicken curry (both £8.95, kids’ versions £4.95). We brought a packed lunch and sat at a bench next to the wooden castle in the adventure play area. If it’s raining you could picnic in the Orangery, a lovely spot looking out across to the main house (cakes £3.25). The Cellar cafe in the house sells main meals as well as cream teas, brownies etc.\nExit through the gift shop?\nThe Handling Hall leads directly to the shop where young eyes are magnetically drawn to the rows of cuddly toys, animal figurines, sweets and games.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Longleat House was the first stately home in the UK to open its doors to visitors – in 1949.\nGetting there\nEasier by car. Warminster station is six miles away, from there it’s a taxi ride.\nValue for money?\nOne-day ticket: adult £28; child (3-14) £20; two-day: adult £38.65; child £30.55. Annual pass: adult £88, child £70.20. It’s so vast that a free repeat visit included in the one-day ticket price would be welcome.\nOpening times\nDaily from 20 March-1 November, 10am-5pm (7pm at peak times and school holidays), longleat.co.uk\nVerdict\n9/10.\nIt was a massive hit with my son, who spent the first hour saying: “Thank you mummy. I love this place.”", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c25m%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+Longleat%2C+Wiltshire&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F01%2Ftake-the-kids-to-longleat-wiltshire-family-day-trips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F1%2F1441111524036%2F6c3cf819-63d6-4533-b96f-5677953283ab-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+Longleat%2C+Wiltshire&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F01%2Ftake-the-kids-to-longleat-wiltshire-family-day-trips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F1%2F1441111638291%2F0a612b2f-0d20-492a-a170-97694c8a9e1d-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c25m%2Fsfb%23img-4&ref=responsive", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+Longleat%2C+Wiltshire&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c25m%2Fstw%23img-4", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+Longleat%2C+Wiltshire&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c25m%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+Longleat%2C+Wiltshire&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c25m%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111452173/d3614fe1-95fa-4f2a-927f-15e6c31cc00d-1020x612.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=18b0c5111d13eea53e4e41c4f34a10cf", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111638291/0a612b2f-0d20-492a-a170-97694c8a9e1d-2060x1236.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=2924842d6bd92cfd5c5ef74e8bb8c568", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111452173/d3614fe1-95fa-4f2a-927f-15e6c31cc00d-1020x612.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=cc2c0f795d65e7a12a2524a5353c4fac", "http://www.longleat.co.uk/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111524036/6c3cf819-63d6-4533-b96f-5677953283ab-2060x1236.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=018f0f494e518412cd71de822a1097d7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111638291/0a612b2f-0d20-492a-a170-97694c8a9e1d-2060x1236.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=549b5daa2ad76ee0badcd4403b36b9bf", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111638291/0a612b2f-0d20-492a-a170-97694c8a9e1d-2060x1236.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=84889cf9dde2d5d580cb4d246042c906", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Take+the+kids+to+%E2%80%A6+Longleat%2C+Wiltshire&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F01%2Ftake-the-kids-to-longleat-wiltshire-family-day-trips&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F1%2F1441111452173%2Fd3614fe1-95fa-4f2a-927f-15e6c31cc00d-1020x612.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111452173/d3614fe1-95fa-4f2a-927f-15e6c31cc00d-1020x612.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=7fcd4c4b3c262fd9835c516479850a92", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111524036/6c3cf819-63d6-4533-b96f-5677953283ab-2060x1236.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=a1c39f97e6cdc21ebff53ba19c22c893", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c25m%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111524036/6c3cf819-63d6-4533-b96f-5677953283ab-2060x1236.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=24e14580754ddc4dd93fbc7eed0b3ab5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111524036/6c3cf819-63d6-4533-b96f-5677953283ab-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=af9b7423566b089c382fa03165ef7188", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111638291/0a612b2f-0d20-492a-a170-97694c8a9e1d-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=816f9c06a6c7c88b39df64b6a0bc5f3b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/1/1441111452173/d3614fe1-95fa-4f2a-927f-15e6c31cc00d-1020x612.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=9afaa5f03c56f2013e6df495039caa65"], "published": "2015-09-01T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:42:31.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
