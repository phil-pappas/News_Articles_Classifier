Comment Posted Sep. 3, 2015 at 6:16 PM By Stan Sulewski Posted Sep. 3, 2015 at 6:16 PM IONIA When Nebraska native Andrew Johnson first enrolled in the School of Missionary Aviation Technology (SMAT) in Ionia, he had no experience in airplane mechanics. One year later, Johnson is a graduate of the school with his A&P Certification, having completed the rigorous training program put on by the instructors of SMAT. Johnson is also pursuing his private and commercial licenses in order to break further into the field of missionary aviation. According to Johnson, the idea to get into missionary aviation stemmed from his upbringing as the son of a missionary and pastor. “I grew up in Nebraska, and my dad is a small-town country church pastor there,” Johnson explained. “I always wanted to get involved in overseas ministry to spread the gospel of who Jesus is, and what he’s done for us. There are places like America and England where churches are well established and well off, but there’s a lot of places in the world that are unevangelized.” He remembers watching a film as a child of a man who had been captured, escaping by plane in the middle of the night in the jungle. “It’s like the frontier missions,” Johnson said. “Going into places where the language they speak isn’t on paper. You go in, learn the language, put it on paper, and translate the bible into that language.” Once he graduated high school, Johnson immersed himself into bible school, which fueled his desire to become involved with missionary work even more. Now, Johnson is planning a trip to the State of Amazonas in Brazil in October to start making his mark on the world of missionary work. “Most mission trips tend to be about getting a group together and building a church, or a school,” Johnson said. “My trip is going to be more of a field visit. I’ll go down there and just live and do everything they do for two weeks, and then boat up the river to another location.” Johnson will be traveling to Brazil with the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism (ABWE). Johnson said he was introduced to the head of the ABWE aviation program, Herman Teachout, and began to discuss the association’s approach to ministry. Teachout then extended the offer to Johnson to come to Brazil to see the process first hand, to which he quickly agreed. Johnson explained that there is a plane where he will be staying that lands directly on the Amazon River. According to Johnson, along with being serviced for every 100 hours of flight, the plane also goes through a yearly process called an ‘annual.’ Johnson said he will be assisting the pilot with the annual, which is a thorough examination of the plane to ensure that everything is up to par. Page 2 of 2 - Johnson is currently raising money for the trip, and has nearly completed his goal. The trip will cost approximately $2,000, and Johnson has managed to raise just over $1,400 in two months. Johnson said that the money raised will go toward airfare to Brazil and to help him live independently from the missionaries currently working in the area. “I want to be able to operate there without being a burden to the missionaries,” Johnson said. “I want to help them, but I don’t want to hinder what they’re trying to do.” With only six weeks until his departure, Johnson said he is brushing up on the language as well as getting the proper shots and medications to prevent against yellow fever, malaria, and tetanus.
