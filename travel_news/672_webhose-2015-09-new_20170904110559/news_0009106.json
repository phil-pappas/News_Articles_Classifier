Emergency consular assistance is available 24 hours by calling our Consular Emergency Centre in Canberra and the contact details for high commissions and consulates are available online ( dfat.gov.au/missions ) or in local phone directories, hotels, tourist offices and police stations.’’\nSTAY IN TOUCH\nThough DFAT is there to help should something go dramatically wrong, it’s still a good idea to communicate with home so family and friends have a vague idea where you are, what you’re doing and where you’re going next.\nI check in twice a day when I’m away and while it’s often a text message from my mobile – as a Telstra customer it generally costs me 75¢ to SMS a few words – Wi-Fi offered free in trains, airports, cafes and hotels means it costs nothing to send an email, Instagram post or Facebook update.\nAnd I always leave a copy of my itinerary at home, with hotels listed when reservations are made in advance, so a quick check can be made when trouble spots feature on the evening news bulletins.", "external_links": ["http://dfat.gov.au/missions"], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:39:44.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
