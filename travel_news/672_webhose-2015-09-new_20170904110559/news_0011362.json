Share this article Share 'When the aircraft was approximately three miles south of London City Airport...the pilot reported seeing a drone at approximately 200m range and at the same height of 2,000ft,' the report said.\n'The pilot reported the incident to air traffic control at the time. After landing the pilot and co-pilot, who had also seen the object, agreed that the miss distance was likely to be 50-150m and that the object was at least 1m in size, was black and white in colour and had some letters on it.\n'A query to London City Tower after landing confirmed that they had had a similar report but not on that day. A passenger on the aircraft also reported seeing a black and white object.
