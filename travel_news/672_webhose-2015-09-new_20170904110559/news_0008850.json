Our annual retail awards recognise excellence in everything from customer experience to product development, sales performance, marketing and business innovation.”\n“TravelPharm is a family-owned New Zealand company specialising in health supplements and organic, natural skincare products. There are three stores in our international terminal, which achieved average sales growth of more than 30% off a very high base in the past year, and there is one store in the domestic terminal. TravelPharm staff are highly motivated and have excellent product knowledge. Their foreign language skills enable them to focus on our rapidly growing Chinese passenger market, and the company management has outstanding relationships with each of the brands they sell. TravelPharm also launched and successfully operates our Casio G-Factory store in the international terminal.”\n“It has been an exciting 12 months in retail for Auckland Airport. We have introduced exciting new local and international brands, as well as two new world-class and innovative duty free operators – The Loop Duty Free and Aelia Duty Free.”\n“We will continue to improve the range of products available to our travellers in the year ahead, and we are already in discussion with a number of local and international retailers who are keen to bring their stores to the airport when we complete the expansion of our international departure area in late-2017,” says Mr Barker.\nSource:- Auckland Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:11:30.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
