It will also assist in determining criteria for body scanning technology requirements for passenger screening at Indian airports.\nMr. G.K. Chaukiyal Member (Operations), AAI and Mr. Henry Steingass, Regional Director for South and Southeast Region, USTDA signed the agreement for Provision – 2 Body Scanner System Pilot Project between Airports Authority of India and United States Trade & Development Agency (USTDA) in the presence of representatives of BCAS and other senior officials of AAI.\nTotal cost of project is US$9,19,471 which includes US$7,12,456 to be funded by USTDA and US$ 2,07,015 to be shared by USTDA select SriLankan Airlines, the national carrier of Sri Lanka, staying true to its Green Vision, “”To be a Planet Friendly Airline accomplishing sustainable and advantageous business development,” has initiated many programmes to conserve environment by reducing the carbon footprint.\nIts latest green initiative, the first in-house model biogas plant, situated in the Airline Centre, Katunayake was commissioned in June this year to coincide with the World Environment day. Implemented as a solution for the disposal of food waste, the biogas plant daily generates 12.5kg of fuel which is equivalent to the capacity of one Liquid Petroleum cylinder. While the annual gas production is estimated at 4500kg, currently 30 per cent of the energy requirement of the Airline Center’s main cafeteria is being fulfilled by biogas.\nThe green team of SriLankan Airlines, the masterminds behind the national carrier’s green efforts, also introduced a waste water treatment plant at the engineering hangar and a solar tube system at the Engineering Module Shop with an annual saving of LKR 1m, which earned the airline the silver award at the National Green Efficiency Awards Ceremony.\nHaving been the first carrier in South Asia to implement the green flight campaign named “Planet friendly flights”, the Airline takes forward its green legacy by implementing various programmes to control carbon emissions while increasing fuel efficiency. This year, the Airline implemented RNAV (Required Navigation) / PBN (Perform Based Navigation) approaches on some of the routes to enhance fuel efficiency with an average saving of 500 kg of fuel per flight. It also initiated a zero fuel weight monitoring mechanism across the network to minimize variances in fuel weight thereby reducing extra fuel uplift.\nThe Airline last year switched to ‘I-pad Electronic Flying’ ( IEF) from bulky mandatory paper manuals, to reduce weight on-board and paper clutter in the cockpit thereby enhancing fuel efficiency, accuracy and safety of operations.\nIt is also working closely with the Airport and Aviation Authority to reduce carbon emissions during aircraft ground movements.ed contractor i.e. L-3 Security and Detection Systems.\nSource:- Srilankan Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:04:39.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
