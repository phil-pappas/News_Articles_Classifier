Here’s what you shouldn’t do Abhinav Verma, Hindustan Times | Updated: Sep 22, 2015 13:00 IST Many older adults are going online to dish about the joys of sex and swap advice about keeping their mojos working well into their twilight years, a new study says. (shutterstock) Tweet \nWhen you meet that attractive woman at a party, you want to show her your best side with your charm turned on. Your online dating profile is no different; you need to make an everlasting impression. The difference in real life dating and online dating is that in real life you can quickly correct a faux pas whereas online dating is brutal. There are no second chances. Here’s how to get your profile right: \nThe pictures you must avoid \nIt’s the first thing anyone is going to see on the dating sites or app. It can make or break your impression. “Your picute shouldn’t over or undersell you. Go for a profile picture which looks real,” says Pulkit Sharma, psychologist. \nNo tigers, please! \n“Aww, that is so cute!!” That is the reaction you get if it’s you and your cat in the picture. But if you are going for a python or a tiger, then your potential dates might sing this to you: “Twinkle twinkle little star, do you know what you are, if you know what you are, then you know that the zoo is not that far”. Tigers and pythons belong to the wild, not your profile picture. \nNo topless pictures \nGreat that you have a six pack but trust us, no one wants to see you topless. You are here to meet new people, and putting topless pictures will make you look like a narcissistic wannabe. Put a picture of you hiking or mountain biking if you want to show that you are a fitness enthusiast. \nThe group photo \nGo for solo pictures. Putting a group picture will make the other person wonder which one you are? Besides, you don’t want her to date your friends, do you? \nRead: Surprise, surprise! Indian women lead, men follow when planning dates \nThe celebrity shot \nPictures with a celebrity? Yes, if you can play it cool. A photo of you freaking out around someone famous isn’t a good look (unless it’s absolutely hilarious). But putting a celebrity as a profile picture without you in it is a turn-off. Who do you want girls to date — you or Brad Pitt? \nPersonal summary \nKeep it short and sweet. Throw in a line from your favourite TV show. Include a hobby or two. \nRead: Rules of online dating: Catfishing can get you mixed reactions \nNo to text lingo \nMaking spelling and grammar mistakes is horrible, and combining them with slangs and text lingo is an attack on the eyes. You can’t expect any literate person to read through your error-filled summary about you. Make an effort, don’t be lazy and do a spell check before you write your personal summary. \nDon’t brag \nConfidence is great, but bragging overconfidently about your abilities, car, bunglow and exotic vacations is not done. Bragging is a turn-off. It makes you appear fake. Go easy about yourself and appear approachable. \nNo demands, please \nDon’t make demands in your bio section. To tell your prospective date how you’d like to be entertained in a restaurant or how you only ride a Jaguar is silly. You are here to find a partner, not a personal secretary to boss around.
