were deserted long ago to make way for new terminals or as a result of war still stand today, and have become so-called ‘ghost airports’.\nWith many in a state of decay, these are some of the eeriest abandoned terminals around the world.\nCyprus' Nicosia International Airport has not had a commercial flight since 1977 after Turkey invaded in response to a military coup\nThe airport lies within a UN-controlled buffer zone and is still used by peacekeepers, although its terminal has fallen into disrepair\nNicosia International Airport, Cyprus\nLocated near the Cypriot capital of Nicosia, this airport has not had a commercial flight since 1977 – three years after a coup d’etat by Greek nationalists and an invasion by Turkish forces.\nHeavy fighting occurred at the airport, which fell within a UN-controlled buffer zone separating Greek and Turkish Cypriots after a ceasefire was signed.\nThe airport is still used by the UN today, but its terminal has fallen beyond disrepair.\nDilapidated planes are abandoned on the tarmac, seats inside the terminal are covered in a thick layer of dust, the ceiling is caving in, and there is a razor-sharp barbed wire throughout.\nAthens’ old international airport served as the Greek capital’s main hub for 60 years before it was replaced with a new airport\nEllinikon airport was seized by the Nazis and used as an air base during World War II, and hosted Olympic events in 2004\nEllinikon International Airport, Athens\nAthens’ old international airport is one of the creepiest abandoned terminals in the world, serving as the Greek capital’s main hub for 60 years.\nIt was seized by the Nazis and used as an air base during World War II, and closed in 2001 when Athens International Airport opened.\nIn 2004 the airfield was converted into a park where a number of events were staged for the Summer Olympics, including field hockey and baseball.\nYasser Arafat International Airport, in the Gaza Strip, was once the pride of Palestinians, but is in ruins after years of war and neglect\nThe airport closed three years after it opened when Israeli forces bombed the control tower and radar station, and later the terminal\nYasser Arafat International Airport, Gaza Strip\nThis airport is in ruins in the desert after years of war and neglect, and was once the pride of Palestinians.\nDesigned by Moroccan architects, it was built in the southern city of Rafah in 1998 with millions of dollars in foreign grants and opened by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and US president Bill Clinton.\nThree years later it was closed after Israeli forces bombed the control tower and radar station, and later the runway and terminal.\nFloyd Bennett Field, New York City’s first municipal airport, was set in Marine Park in Brooklyn, and officially opened in 1931\nThe airport was once used as a point of departure for record-breaking flights by Amelia Earhart and Howard Hughes\nFloyd Bennett Field, New York City\nNew York City’s first municipal airport was set in Marine Park in the borough of Brooklyn, and officially opened in 1931.\nIt was once used as a point of departure for record-breaking flights by Amelia Earhart and Howard Hughes, but was converted into a Naval Air Station in 1941.\nNow a national recreation area governed by the National Park Service, it is now home to an NYPD helicopter base, urban camping programme and the Historic Aircraft Restoration Project.\nWhile the old terminal may be sitting empty, the retired airfield at Berlin’s Tempelhof Airport has been converted into a public park\nThe grounds at Tempelhof Airport saw their last flight in 2008, and now play host to fairs and events, including concerts\nTempelhof Airport, Berlin\nWhile the old terminal may be sitting empty, the airfield at Berlin’s Tempelhof Airport gets a lot of use by locals.\nSeven years after it ceased operations, the airport’s grounds are a public park where Berlin residents can cycle and run.\nIt also hosts fairs and events, with plans for the 2017 IGA, an international horticultural exhibition.\nJaisalmer Airport can accommodate hundreds of thousands of travellers a year, but has never received a single passenger\nSeats in the waiting lounge are covered in a thick layer of dust, walls are stained, and pigeons nest in the airport's roof\nJaisalmer Airport, India\nA new terminal built in India’s ‘Golden City’ can accommodate hundreds of thousands of travellers a year, but has never received a single passenger.\nDespite being built nearly three years ago at a cost of nearly £11million (approximately $17million), the terminal in Jaisalmer, in India’s north-western Rajasthan state, remains closed and is beginning to show signs of decay.\nSeats in the waiting lounge are covered in a thick layer of dust, walls are stained, pigeons nest in the roof and the bones of dead animals are scattered at the entrance.\nWith parking bays for three 180-seat planes, the empty terminal sits behind a fence and locked gate, and highlights the government’s failed gamble to capitalise on a surge in air travel.\nCiudad Real Central Airport was built at a boom time for €1bn, but has become a symbol of wasteful spending in Spain\nThe airport closed in 2012, just four years after opening, and was supposed to include a high-speed rail terminal with services to Madrid\nCiudad Real Central Airport, Spain\nThere was one bid – for just €10,000 (£7,300) – when this ‘ghost’ airport went up for auction earlier this year.\nBut Tzaneen International’s bid was not immediately accepted, as a judge deemed it too low and opened the door to higher bids.\nBoasting one of the longest runways in Europe, the airport was built at a cost of €1bn during a boom time in Spain, but became a symbol of wasteful spending after it closed in 2012, just four years after opening.\nOnce used by budget carriers Ryanair and Vueling Airlines, the airport would become a hub for Chinese cargo flights if Tzaneen International gets its way.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1ES3jRN"], "published": "2015-09-11T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T15:40:51.278+03:00",
