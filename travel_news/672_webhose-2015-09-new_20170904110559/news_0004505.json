The standard of the entries and effort put into the designs were once again exceptional and made the judges’ decision extremely tough. In the end it was Maddy’s creativity and caring thoughts for others that made her entry stand out,” Mr Evers said.\n“Maddy’s ‘Get well soon’ concept has been awarded the honour and privilege of being built to appear in this year’s Pageant, $500 donated by the credit unions and a visit to Stardust Castle to preview the completed mini-float with her class,” he said.\nAll designs in the Mini-Float Competition had to be original and could not include branded signage or copyright characters, or themes from movies or musicals.\nA mini-float is a small mobile set that is light enough to be pushed or pulled along the Pageant route.\nThe 2015 Credit Union Christmas Pageant is on Saturday, 14 November 2015.\nThe Credit Union Christmas Pageant is owned and managed by the South Australian Tourism Commission on behalf of the South Australian Government and sponsored by four leading credit unions in South Australia – People’s Choice, Beyond Bank Australia, Credit Union SA and Police Credit Union.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:23:51.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
