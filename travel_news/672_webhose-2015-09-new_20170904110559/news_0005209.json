CWT enables us to move profiles from country to country, saving our travellers the hassle of having to fill out their profiles every time they are transferred.” \nSwiss global financial services company UBS had also recently replaced 13 different relationships with its TMCs in 13 markets with two in the US and Asia-Pacific. It also set up four to five call centres across the world. \nDebbie Winston, executive director, regional head of travel, Asia Pacific, commented: “We see the value of a global travel programme which offers better compliance. The online booking tools particularly drive better behaviour as the number of touches per transaction is less than 25. Disciplined bookers drive efficiency and bring savings.” \nHowever, travel managers pointed out that content gaps in Asia-Pacific, especially in air and hotel components in China and Japan, are limiting the real potential for companies to move entirely to a centralised travel management system. \nLiew said: “GDS system is different here in Asia and languages are diverse. We still have to rely on local TMCs in China and Japan. In China we use Ctrip.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T11:45:57.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
