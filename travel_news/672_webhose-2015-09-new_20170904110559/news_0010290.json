Proof, if needed, that golfing connoisseurs see southern Sicily as the perfect place to escape to. And with good reason. Like Spain’s Costa del Sol, Sicily’s spring and autumn weather is perfect, but its food, wine and ambiance are on another planet.\nTwo contrasting resorts, Donnafugata and Verdura, stand 80 miles apart looking across the Mediterranean towards Africa’s northern coast. Each has two courses. With direct flights to Catania in the shadow of Mount Etna, four rounds of golf and two days of world-class sightseeing, it’s hard to imagine a more rewarding week’s holiday.\nThe Verdura resort is picturesque to say the least, near the pretty fishing port of Sciacca\nDonnafugata is the classic option. The 6,000-acre estate has a courtyard of venerable restored buildings at its heart. But the U-shaped area comprising 200 spacious rooms is a 21st Century addition. Terraces full of loungers overlook the Parkland and Links courses – and the rich variety of the terrain more than makes up for the unimaginative names.\nAnd if your game lets you down, the newly installed Darren Clarke Centre Of Excellence can provide a fix.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Enjoy the good life as a guest of Prince Charles as you...

Share this article Share 119 shares Once the day’s work is done, the sofas outside the Il Palmeto wine bar beckon. For dinner, try swordfish, bream or tuna prepared in mouth-watering ways in Il Carrubo.\nThe nearest of several Unesco World Heritage towns is Ragusa, built on limestone hills divided by a ravine. Even if all its 75,000 citizens were religious, they couldn’t fill the sumptuously gilded Baroque churches that dominate its cobbled streets. Antiquities apart, it has two compelling plus points.\nFans of the Inspector Montalbano series will appreciate the sinister urban maze in which Italy’s answer to Inspector Morse plies his trade. And gourmets will enjoy no fewer than four Michelin restaurants, an exceptional concentration for a small place.\nRagusa is a town built on limestone hills divided by a ravine and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nThe most exotic is Locanda Don Serafina, limestone caves that once stabled horses converted into a rabbit-warren restaurant.\nMoving on from Donnafugata is a triumph of will over inertia, but the splendour of ancient Akragas, monumental Greek temples built in the sixth century BC on a two-mile ridge above the Mediterranean at Agrigento, jolts the adventurer’s spirit back to life.\nNext stop Verdura, near the pretty fishing port of Sciacca.\nInside the resort, I find Sir Rocco Forte himself... craggy and gracious as he orders up platters of grilled snapper for his cronies.\nFew would doubt that the marathon-running hotelier built Verdura, the only golf and spa resort in his 11-strong Rocco Forte luxury portfolio, in pursuit of personal pleasure.\nThe island of Sicily offers some nice golf courses with some even nicer views while playing\nOver lunch on the terrace of Torre Verdura, the medieval watchtower that dominates the property, Niall Cameron, an ex-tour professional, confirmed that his boss is a tiger on the range and a ferocious competitor on the links. No surprise that Forte hired the best to design East and West, two courses of equal quality with stunning climax holes along the beach.\nOverall, the resort is family friendly, with a club for children aged two months to 12 years and organised sport including football, tennis, kayaking, sailing and windsurfing for teenagers.\nThe rooms are aggressively modern, rather bleak from outside, but genuinely five-star within. Just perfect after a day on the fairways.\nBOOK YOUR TRIP TO SICILY Your Golf Travel ( yourgolftravel.com , 0800 043 6644) offers a seven-night holiday to Sicily from October 6-13 including three nights b&b at Donnafugata, with two rounds of golf, and four nights B&B at Verdura, with two rounds, from £1,229pp.\nIncludes Easyjet flights and car hire.\nRead more: Book Golf Holidays & Weekend Golf Breaks Online At YourGolfTravel.com", "external_links": ["http://yourgolftravel.com/", "http://dailym.ai/1X0atcj", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-30T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:13:32.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
