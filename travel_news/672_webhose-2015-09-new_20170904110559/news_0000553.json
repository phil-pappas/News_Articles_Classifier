It features a 124 ci engine, and Mike Tyson's iconic tattoo incorporated into an airbrushed paint scheme, with matching machined wheels and accessories.\nDisplaying the first \"Iron Flight\" motorcycle to a packed house in Charlottetown , President of Havoc Motorcycles, Dr Jarrod Wiener , said, \"We are passionately committed to making motorcycles that enable riders to symbolize their individuality, the source of their strength and freedom. We're thrilled to be working with Mike Tyson and look forward to introducing riders to the Havoc Motorcycles lineup.\"\nHavoc motorcycles will offer three models initially, all of the heavyweight cruiser type. All feature large displacement engines (113ci to 124ci). Each motorcycle is hand-crafted, featuring sculpted and molded bodywork of the 'custom bagger' style to offer enthusiasts a custom-inspired motorcycle right from the assembly floor.\n\"We've all bought new motorcycles. On the sales floor, it's the best machine available. Then you get it home, and the huge accessories catalog comes in the mail to improve it. You can rebuild the whole bike and still park it next to a nearly identical motorcycle in a parking lot. We build your Havoc Motorcycle the way you want it from the get-go,\" says Wiener.\nCustomers can personalize their motorcycles with a wide range of options from the factory, including a choice of wheels, billet accessories, powder-coating, anodizing, and paint finishes.
