This year, to celebrate the occasion, Australian travel operator helloworld is hosting a revolutionary social experiment with the world’s first Instagram Relay.\n \nBeginning at sunrise on September 27, Instagrammers from around the world will begin sharing images –one per hour for 12 hours in their particular locations. The relay begins in Samoa and will travel across the world until it finishes at sunset in the Cook Islands.\n \nSeventy-five locations throughout 60 countries will be represented. Whistler is very excited to be one of only two Canadian destinations taking part – the city of Montreal being the other – through support from Destination Canada and Destination BC. In Whistler, the initiative is also supported by Tourism Whistler and Whistler Blackcomb.\n \nAs part of the initiative, Destination Canada has invited renowned Australian digital influencer Matt Glastonbury (@mattglastonbury/ 181,000 followers) to participate as one of the lead Instagrammers. Glastonbury will be on location in Whistler on September 27 and sharing his images of the resort. Following the relay, Glastonbury will temporarily “take over” Tourism Whistler’s Instagram account (@gowhistler).\n \nGlastonbury will also join an Instameet which will be held to coincide with a local influencer, Caley Vanular (@caleyvanular / 60,500 followers) atop Whistler Mountain at the Roundhouse Lodge/P2P gondola from 11:25 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. Instagram users can be involved by attending, sharing images and geo-tagging Whistler and hashtagging #helloworldRELAY. Additional hashtags in use will be #OnlyInWhistler and #360ofWB.
