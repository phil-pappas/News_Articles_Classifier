You can walk far out into the warm water and float, gazing up at the sky, because the sea is so calm. There is snorkelling off the beach. Sun chairs are plentiful. Water sports are at the ready. It is a fantastic playground for fun-seekers of all ages and it is right on the front door of Beaches Turks and Caicos Resort Villages and Spa – part of Sandals, the resort chain voted the world’s leading for all-inclusive resorts at the World Travel Awards for the past 17 years. Parents who take their children (and often bring the grandparents too) to Beaches Turks and Caicos swear they have discovered the perfect all-inclusive family getaway. With its four distinctly characterful accommodation areas – Key West Luxury Village, the Italian Village, French Village and Caribbean Seaside Village – 21 restaurants, 14 bars, 10 swimming pools, three tennis courts, spa and fitness centre, comprehensive scuba diving programme, Xbox Play Lounge, teens game room and supervised kids camps, there is something for everyone. At its heart lies the fantasy Pirates Island Waterpark – the Caribbean’s largest, measuring 27,000 square feet – where kids of all ages (and big kids at heart) have a blast swooshing down gigantic waterslides, dodging blasts from the water cannons and trying out the swim-up soda bars. There are also whirlpools, a lazy river and the Caribbean's only surf simulator. Three to five year-olds are happily engaged in shell collecting, face painting, treasure hunts, puppets, costume time and magic shows Kids Camps operate from 9am to 9pm, though some open earlier to accommodate parents going on the early scuba-diving expeditions. Much thought has gone into tailor-made fun and amenities for babies, kids, tweens and teens to allow adults precious time alone. Even when the resort is full, an air of serenity prevails. Certified nannies take care of babies and toddlers in nurseries full of toys, with entertainment from Sesame Street ® Caribbean Adventure . Three to five year-olds are happily engaged in shell collecting, face painting, treasure hunts, puppets, costume time, magic shows and sand castle building. Pre-teens can sail, snorkel, swim, play beach volleyball and soccer, go on scavenger hunts and glass-bottom boat rides, or try a reggae jam session. Teens hang out in independent zones with pizza and soda bars and their own karaoke nightclub as well as group water sports, boat cruises, pool olympics, tennis clinics, parties, talent shows and so on. Beyond the resort, Turks and Caicos consists of 40 different islands and cays to discover, and a legendarily mesmerising coral reef. Natural beauty abounds in a paradise for bird-watchers. A true island escape necessitates a private haven within the resort. Here, one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom family suites are available. Spacious and luxurious, these range from sprawling beachfront sets of rooms to expansive villas ideal for multi-generational travels. Some have a kitchen and dining room; all have comfortable seating areas, balconies and lavish bathrooms. Many of the kids’ bedrooms feature built-in bunk beds, Xbox consoles and game tables. It is tough for everyone when it’s time to pack up and go. • For more information on Caribbean holidays, visit sandals.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:32:16.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
