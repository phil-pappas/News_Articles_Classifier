But the screening and monitoring will continue for travellers from Guinea and Sierra Leone.\nThe screening of travellers from the three West African nations began last October when the countries were in the midst of the worst Ebola epidemic in world history.\nBut the epidemic has waned. International health officials this month said the Ebola virus is no longer spreading in Liberia.\nTravellers from Liberia will no longer be funneled through only five U.S. airports, either, unless they've been in Guinea or Sierra Leone in the previous three weeks.\nLiberia will continue to screen passengers for Ebola as they leave the country.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T02:37:55.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
