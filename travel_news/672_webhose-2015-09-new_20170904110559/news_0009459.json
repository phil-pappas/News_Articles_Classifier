More Alton Towers revenue drop hits Merlin \n“The transaction will significantly accelerate our Burger King restaurant growth in France, a key strategic market,” said Daniel Schwartz, chief executive of Restaurant Brands International , owner of Burger King, as the deal was announced on Monday. \nFrance has been looking increasingly appetising for fast-food companies in recent years with demand for burgers rising sharply . \nA report from consultancy group Gira Conseil showed there were 970m burgers sold in France in 2013, representing half of all sandwiches sold. This was compared to just one in seven in 2007. \nSales at fast-food outlets outpaced those of traditional restaurants for the first time in 2012, prompting a bout of soul searching in the country that prides itself on its haute cuisine. \nLocal commentators have blamed the increasing Americanisation of French culture and the decline of the traditional sit-down meal. \nMcDonald’s was the focus of anti-globalisation protests throughout much of the 1990s in France, but has since rebuilt its reputation and has its own French slang nickname “McDo”. \nIt now has 1,354 outlets in France, including at the Louvre and on the Champs-Elysee in Paris. The country is McDonald’s second-most profitable market in terms of contribution to global operating income. \n$23bn \nAnnual sales at Burger King Worldwide in 2014 \nBurger King France has annual sales of €5m and approximately 50 restaurants. After the transaction it will have about 500 outlets and €1bn in sales, the company said in a statement on Monday. \nBurger King left France in 1997 after weak sales, only making its return in 2013, when it promised to step up competition against McDonald’s and Quick. The deal will see the French Quick outlets rebranded as Burger King. \nQuick operates 509 restaurants in France, Belgium, Luxemburg and outside of Europe. It will retain the Quick name outside of France. \nThe deal will see Groupe Bertrand, the majority shareholder of Burger King France, buy Quick Group from Qualium Investissement, a subsidiary of the Caisse des Dépôts, a French state investment fund. The price was not disclosed. \nRestaurant Brands International, the Canadian parent company for Tim Hortons and Burger King Worldwide, posted $23bn in annual sales last year and has more than 19,000 restaurants in roughly 100 countries. \nThe proposed transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
