Montecillo, director for the Department of Tourism in Region 7, said in a press briefing that Cebu City has started receiving cruise lines, the latest of which was last week, wherein a group of some 1,000 guests stayed overnight.\n“Yes, we do want to be included in the map (of international cruise lines). Right now, we have some problems with the port area but the Cebu Port Authority is looking into that. They are looking at another place or another town very near Cebu City to transfer all of these cargo ships so that we can allow the Cebu International Port, or Port 6 or Pier 6 to really concentrate on cruise liners,” Montecillo said.\nThe tourism official added that the construction of a new international container port in Consolacion, a first class municipality in Cebu, would hopefully push through and be completed so that the DOT in Region 7 could already aggressively sell Cebu City as a global cruise destination.\nMontecillo said many of the global cruise companies have expressed interest in Cebu primarily because of existing tour packages for those wanting to stay overnight.\nThe DOT has since been in talks with some of the biggest cruise companies in the world as it seeks to position the Philippines as a global cruise ship destination.\nLast year, the Philippine envoy to Washington disclosed that three of the world’s leading cruise companies have expressed interest to help develop the Philippines as a cruise destination. The cruise companies which evinced interest were Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Lines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:06:43.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
