UNWTO projected an increase in 12% every year and the country is poised to excel in tourism in the near future. According to the figures, Vietnam received 54 million tourists in 2014 accounting for a US$61 billion to the revenue of the country. It is observed that 20% of the international tourists coming to the South Asia Pacific region are visiting these five countries in the recent past.\nHere are the country wise highlights of the Seminar on “ Route To World Culture Heritages in Greater Mekong Sub-Region” held at Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre (SECC):\nStrategically located by the Da Nang International Airport, the Quang Nam region in Vietnam is home to two World Heritage sites – the Hoi An ancient town and the My Son Sanctuary. In 2014, the Quang Nam region welcomed nearly 3.7 million tourists. Moreover, the place offers a scenic coastline of more than 120 kms, over 350 historical relics and a world biosphere reserve for global tourists. With 6000 rooms and more than 60 travel agents working in cooperation with the government, the Quang Nam region is set to break travel and tourism boundaries in the coming future.\nThe tourism potential of the cultural heritage in Siemreap was the focus of the delegate team from Cambodia during the seminar. The Siem Reap-Angkor is considered as the Heritage of Humanity and World Wonder. Cambodia aims to promote the GMS tourism in the near future and is rolling out new opportunities for the local and global tourism stakeholders. The seminar also witnessed the announcement of the “Cambodia Travel Mart” to be held in August 2016. With the increasing infrastructure and quality of travel products and services, Cambodia is set to welcome over 5 million tourists in 2015 and expects a rise to 8 million tourists by 2020.\nThe Luang Prapang heritage site in Laos is another major attraction along the Mekong River. Laos is considerably a small country with one international airport but it still manages to allure over 1 million tourists every year. With rich cultural diversities and heritage sites such as Vat That Luang, Vat Xiengthong, the National Museum, Pak Ou Caves and the beautiful Khouang Sy Waterfalls, Laos is drawing a lot of spotlight during the recent times.\nThe ChiangMai region of Thailand is on the tentative list of the World Heritage sites and continues to allure cultural tourists from all round the world. ChiangMai is truly a fast developing city but still offers very distinctive cultural experiences along with its distinctive food and art.\nFormerly known as Pagan, the city of Bagan in Myanmar was previously the capital of the country. It is located in the Mandalay region of Myanmar. Out of the 10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas, and monasteries that were constructed in the Bagan plains in the 11th to 13th century, 2000 still remain. The place offers the best sunrise and sunset destinations for photography and tourists from all round the globe covet a glimpse of the sun rising or setting amid the surreal skyline of Bagan.\nFive countries – One Destinations is probably one of the major ambitious projects in the ASEAN countries that expects tourism to be the flag bearer of economy in the five countries. As the seminar concludes the expectation of mutual cooperation and bilateral partnerships to promote cultural tourism along the Greater Mekong sub-region spoke volumes about the future prospects of these five countries.\nITE HCMC proved to be the perfect podium to stage, plan and materialize a multi-national tourism strategy that will enhance the ASEAN as well as the Asian tourism industry in the near future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:16:09.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
