It is the perfect treatment for post-golfing recovery, or even for non-golfers who are seeking the relief of a deep tissue massage.”\nAvailable as a 90 or 120 minute treatment with full body stretching, the Golf Ball Massage helps boosts circulation while easing sore muscles and repairing muscle tissue to aid mobility. Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita is home to an Ernie Els Design golf course and all guests may enjoy unlimited, complimentary play throughout their stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T21:16:13.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
