The competition is all about promoting photography and tourism, and the inaugural competition has proved to have been a great success. The book we produced is a best seller in the shops and the exhibition of winning images was so popular that they had extended runs at various galleries across Scotland. The exhibitions have been a notable success of the competition.\n“In this day and age we’re used to seeing images on a screen, but seeing the winning images printed and hanging on a wall has seen several of the photographers earn sales and many visitors have been inspired by their work to take up photography too. The exhibitions have also been good for tourism because they’ve raised the profiles of the places in the images and encouraged tourists to visit these places during their stay. I’m really excited about seeing this year’s entries and hoping to build on that success once again.”\nThe competition has been endorsed by VisitScotland, Scotland’s national tourism organisation.\nMalcolm Roughead, Chief Executive of VisitScotland said:\n“We welcome the return of Scottish Landscape Photographer of the Year competition. With over 11,000km of coastline, hundreds of islands, majestic mountains and beautiful canals, rivers and lochs, Scotland’s landscape and distinct geography makes for the perfect photographer’s playground.\n“From the Scottish Borders to the Shetland Islands, we have a worldwide reputation for our natural beauty with has inspired both photographers and filmmakers alike to come to our shores and take in our spectacular landscapes. They say a picture paints a thousand words and we look forward to seeing ‘essays’ of wonder from entrants once again.”\nThe competition is open to amateur, professional and young photographers from the UK and overseas.
