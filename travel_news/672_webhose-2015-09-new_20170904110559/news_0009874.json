With tender chunks of chicken coated in a mildly spiced sauce with mayonnaise, the dish was deemed to have the appropriate combination of luxury and austerity at a time when the country was still experiencing post-war rationing. SERVES 6 INGREDIENTS For the rolls ½ tsp dried yeast Pinch of sugar 150g strong wholemeal flour 50g strong plain flour 15g unsalted butter, cubed Good pinch of salt For the coronation chicken 1 tsp curry powder 4 tbsp mayonnaise 1 tsp crème fraîche 1½ tbsp mango chutney 100g roast chicken, shredded Sprigs of watercress METHOD Put the yeast in a bowl with the sugar. Add 1 tbsp warm water and set aside to allow the yeast to activate. Sift the flours into a bowl and rub in the butter and salt with your fingertips. Make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast mixture, along with 125-150ml warm water. Mix well then knead on a board to make a soft, sticky dough. Place in a clean bowl, cover and allow to rise for 30 minutes in a warm place. Divide the dough into six and shape each one into a finger roll. Put on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment and leave to prove for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 375F/190C/Gas 5. Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes until golden and the base sounds hollow when tapped. Cool on a wire rack. Put the curry powder in a pan and heat for a minute or two until you can smell the aroma of the spices. Tip into a bowl and add the mayonnaise, crème fraîche, chutney and plenty of seasoning. Stir in the chicken. If the mixture is very thick, stir in 1-2 tsp water. Slice the rolls in half. Spoon a little coronation chicken on to the bottom of each, top with watercress then rest the roll on top and serve. Tea Fit For A Queen is published by Ebury priced £10.
