There was, however, a flight to Faro due out at 14:50.'\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Qatar Airways finally 'shamed' into relaxing controversial... Has Harry Styles sunk SeaWorld?

Share this article Share 1.1k shares Thinking that they might have missed an email notification, Darren asked his wife to check their confirmation email and the date of departure.\nConfused, they quickly headed to the Monarch customer service desk to enquire.\nHaving used travel agent lowcostholidays to book, they expected to take a 13:15 flight to Faro - and had confirmation to prove it\n'The lady at the desk seemed as puzzled as we were,' he recalled. 'She said: \"We don't do flights to Faro at 13:15.\"'\nDarren asked if, perhaps, they had been booked on the regularly-scheduled 14:50 flight, instead - but, after thoroughly checking the passenger manifest, the Monarch representative confirmed that the family was not confirmed on that flight either.\n'At this point, my wife and kids started to get very upset at the thought of not having a holiday,' he adds.\nHaving booked the Â£1,700 vacation through third party travel agent lowcostholidays, Darren quickly rang up the company's hotline to see if they could help.\nBut after explaining the situation - including the numerous flight, hotel and transfer confirmation emails that Darren had received from them - lowcostholidays agreed that all should be well.\n'They said, it 'wasn't their fault,'' Darren said.\nHowever, once Darren and his wife (left) arrived at the airport, they found that their Portugal flight did not exist\nThankfully, Monarch was able to sort out a flight for Darren and his children later that day, and another seat for his wife on a Faro flight the following morning\nThankfully, after two hours spent at the Monarch desk, the airline revealed that two seats had come available on the 14:50 flight and that Darren and his daughter could board.\nThey promised that his wife and son would be able to join on the 6am flight the following morning.\n'Realising this was our only option, we accepted,' Darren explained. 'We said our goodbyes agreeing to meet at the resort hotel the following day.'\nHowever, after he and his daughter headed to departures, his wife and son were informed that they were being let through with temporary boarding passes to board the flight with the rest of their family.\nAnd while a third seat did ultimately come available, there was no fourth seat available on stand-by.\n'With everyone in tears, and my wife standing at the aircraft gate, we again said our goodbyes,' he added.\nAs it turns out, the Hall family's booking confirmation had never been relayed to Monarch and there was no history of the family having booked their flights at all\nAfter a slight luggage debacle - his wife's luggage had to be removed and, in doing so, the airline accidentally also removed his son's bag - Darren and his two children were on their way.\n'My wife flew out the following day with two suitcases and hand luggage - and I had to pay for another transfer to the hotel,' Darren said, adding that the family was reunited the following morning in Portugal.\nStill, Darren and his family never did manage to solve the mystery of exactly what had happened between booking the getaway online and showing up at the airport to find that such a flight did not exist.\nBut, as it turns out, the entire ordeal can be attributed to simple human error.\nLowcostholidays admits that the entire incident was due to 'an unfortunate human error in the system'\nA representative for lowcostholidays tells MailOnline Travel that they were disappointed to hear about the problems that the Hall family experienced.\n'An urgent investigation was taken place by the team who can confirm that there was an unfortunate human error in the system between lowcostholidays and their flight supplier, resulting in a failed booking for these flights, which did not come to light until the family arrived at the airport,' lowcostholidays said in a statement.\n'Monarch arranged flights for three of the party for that day and organised accommodation and flights for Ms Sheasby the following day to join her family on holiday. lowcostholidays apologises for the inconvenience and distress this error caused and are providing a full refund of the flight cost.'\nMonarch was also quite perplexed by the ordeal, adding that such an incident is 'unprecedented'.\n'Mr Hall booked his holiday and flights through a third party, and not directly with Monarch,' a spokesperson for the airline tells MailOnline Travel exclusively.\n'The flight reservation wasn't confirmed due to an administration error between Mr Hall's agent and Monarch. This error was not discovered until Mr Hall and his family arrived at Birmingham airport on 25 July.\n'At the airport, Monarch staff did all they could to accommodate Mr Hall despite limited availability on flights. Monarch were able to offer Mr Hall and his family three seats on a flight departing on 25 July to Faro, and one seat on a flight the following day.\n'Mr Hall travelled with his two children on 25 July, Ms Sheasby was given one night's accommodation at a hotel local to Birmingham airport and joined the rest of her family in Faro the following day (26 July.)\n'We were pleased to be able to assist Mr Hall and his family with flights to Faro and will be working with lowcostholidays to make sure incidents like this do not happen in the future.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1PEgiXc"], "published": "2015-08-29T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:12:27.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
