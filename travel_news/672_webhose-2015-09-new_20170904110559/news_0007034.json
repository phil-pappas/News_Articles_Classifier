Delta has held similar Block Party events across the airline’s network over the last few months to thank employees for their dedication to serving customers over the busy summer months and throughout the year.\nWith the renewal, Delta also continues to be the presenting partner of the Starting XI.\nThe partnership renewal demonstrates Delta’s commitment not only to Pacific Northwest customers, but to the Seattle-area community.\n“Delta’s commitment to Seattle doesn’t stop at the airport,” said Mike Medeiros, Delta’s Vice President – Seattle. “As an airline, we’re always looking to enhance the customer experience – but our partnership with the Sounders lets us enhance the fan experience, as well. With the extension, we look forward to continue serving Sounders fans both at the airport and on the field.”\nAt the airport, Seattle is Delta’s fastest-growing international hub with more than 120 peak-day flights to 36 destinations, including service to eight long-haul international destinations – Amsterdam, Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Paris, Seoul, Shanghai and Tokyo. Delta has also invested $15 million in its facilities at Sea-Tac, including its recently completed lobby renovations, new Delta Sky Club, Sky Priority services, new gate area power recharging stations and expanded ticket counters.\nSource:- Delta Air Lines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:49:10.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
