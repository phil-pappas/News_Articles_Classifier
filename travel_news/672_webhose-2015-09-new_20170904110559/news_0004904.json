HomeEscape , the web’s fastest growing vacation listing and rental site, wants to reverse that trend.\n“The ethos of our company is for people to get out and explore the world. We’ve made our site a free platform so users don’t have to worry about the costs – a common concern that prevents travelers from booking their vacation,” remarked Vaknin.\nAbout HomeEscape: Headquartered in Miami, Florida, HomeEscape connects homeowners and property managers with travelers who seek the space, value and amenities of vacation rental homes as an alternative to hotels.
