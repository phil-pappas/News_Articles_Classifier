Comprising of 50 apartments, including a 15th century townhouse and three penthouses, Old Town Chambers have made the shortlist for the Guest Experience Award and the Hospitality Award, highlighting the high standards of service it provides. \nAs previous winners of the Scottish Hotel Awards Services Apartments Regional Award, 2015, the team behind the city centre-based serviced apartments, will attend the ceremony in London on 3 December. Julie Grieve, CEO of Lateral City, operator of Old Town Chambers, said: “We are thrilled to have been shortlisted for the ASAP awards this year. It’s a great reflection of all the hard work our team here has put in over the year and how satisfied our guests have been with their experience. “There was a record number of 39 members being shortlisted for the awards this year which means tough competition, but we are looking forward to going to the ceremony with our fingers crossed, and hope our hard work pays off. “We provide a really unique experience for our guests and pride ourselves in the hospitality offering, so hopefully we see this reflected when the winners are announced in December.” Old Town Chambers is not your average city-centre serviced apartments as the decor blends state-of the-art facilities with centuries old architectural features, such as solid stone walls, original fireplaces and painted wall panels and beams, contrasting against double smoked French oak wooden flooring and Italian tiling, alongside the latest home entertainment system and a 24 hour concierge service. The guest experience is also unique with features such as a bespoke access system where guests are free to come and go as they please, individual tours of Edinburgh’s Old Town and collaborations with Harvey Nichols, Edinburgh Playhouse, Angels with Bagpipes and Zizzi’s, entitling guests to exclusive offers and discounts during their stay. The recent addition of a breakfast option has also boosted the services at Old Town Chambers with The Real Mary King’s Close offering guests a full Scottish or continental breakfast or a breakfast pack which can be pre-booked and delivered to their apartment. Julie added: “We really strive to give our guests’ the best experience when they come to visit, so to be recognised for our efforts would be superb. “We look forward to the ceremony and continuing to welcome guests to experience what we have to offer.” Additional features include original period wall paintings, exposed brick, through to bluetooth Bose sound systems, Smart TVs and a multi-zone heating system in every room. Entry is via a keypad for which every guest has a specific code. Prices range from £129 to £1200 per night.
