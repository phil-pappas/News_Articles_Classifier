(NASDAQ CM: SINO) (\"Sino-Global\" or the \"Company\"), a Virginia company engaged in shipping, chartering, logistics and related services, today announced that the Company has been appointed by Rong Yao International Shipping Limited (the \"Vessel Seller\") to oversee the ship management operation for the 8,818 gross tonnage oil/chemical transportation tanker, the \"Rong Zhou\" (the \"Vessel\"). Such appointment by the Vessel Seller is intended to allow for a smooth transition of the eventual ownership of the Vessel to Sino-Global. Currently, the Vessel trades in connection with the transportation of olein and refined bleached and deodorized palm kernel oil from ports in Indonesia to ports in Mainland China. The Vessel has recently completed its scheduled special survey and its NK classification inspection, and is en-route to its next destination.\nIn addition, Sino-Global has reached an agreement with the third-party charterer of the Vessel (the \"Charterer\") pursuant to which Sino-Global will become the exclusive general shipping agent for the Vessel. The Company believes that this agreement allows Sino-Global to maximize its service opportunities from the Vessel, including chartering, shipping agency and ship management services. Based on available information, the Company believes that the new general shipping agency services will generate revenues to Sino-Global of approximately $0.5 million in fiscal year 2016. All revenues to be received by the Company from the shipping agency services related to the Vessel are US dollar denominated.\nAs previously reported by the Company, in May 2015 the Vessel Seller time-chartered the Vessel to Sino-Global for a two-year period, and Sino-Global, in turn, time-chartered the Vessel to the Charterer for the same two-year period. Under the terms of such chartering agreements, the Charterer will pay Sino-Global a chartering fee of $7,500 per day, and in turn, the Company will pay the Vessel Seller a chartering fee of $3,500 per day. Given its role as an overseer of the ship management operation for the Vessel Seller, Sino-Global is no longer required to remit the $3,500 per day chartering fee to the Vessel Seller but will be responsible for the review, approval and payment of related vessel operating expenses. Sino-Global plans to handle all related ship management duties via its existing ship management service platform in Hong Kong .\nMr. Lei Cao, Chief Executive Officer of Sino-Global, said, \"We welcome the service appointment from the Vessel Seller, as it is a testament of the Vessel Seller's commitment towards Sino-Global's eventual ownership of the Vessel. Having the opportunity to oversee the Vessel's ship management operation now will allow us to ensure a smooth transition upon closing with a continued commitment towards efficient cost management. In addition, we are very excited about this new general shipping agency service agreement with the Charterer as it gives us a tremendous opportunity to optimize our operating cash flows and increase our shipping agency revenues in fiscal year 2016.\"\nAbout Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd.\nFounded in the United States in 2001, Sino-Global Shipping America, Ltd. is a company engaged in shipping, chartering, logistics and related services.
