I will be taking the Pune - Nashik highway(NH50) but am confused where to leave it. According to google map I have choices between a) taking a left turn from Narayangaon and take the road till Junnar. From there take the Junnar-Kalyan road and reach Malshej Ghat b) continue on NH50 till Alephata & take left from there onto Ahmednagar-Kalyan road and reach Mashej Ghat. Can somebody advice which route will be the best in terms of road conditions? According to map the 2nd option will be adding 20KMs more but I am ready to take it if the road conditions are better. Urgent help would be highly appreciated.. Thanks in advance", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:02:05.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
