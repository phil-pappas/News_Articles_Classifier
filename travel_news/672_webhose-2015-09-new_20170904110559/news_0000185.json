At a ceremony at Bath Racecourse, 24 September, the Abbey Hotel was named Business of the Year and won Best Business Website while hotel owner Ian Taylor was named Business Person of the Year. \nIan Taylor commented “We are absolutely delighted to have been honoured with these awards. It is so lovely to be recognised after three and a half years of hard work and for our contribution to the Bath community. It has been a true team effort to reach this point in our story and the success at these awards marks the culmination of an exciting period for us.” Since Ian & Christa Taylor took over the Abbey Hotel in 2012, the hotel has gone from strength to strength. With a new website launched in May 2015, the completion of the refurbishment of 60 bedrooms and striking new interiors for Allium restaurant and ArtBar by Martin Hulbert Design, the stage is set for the Abbey Hotel to enter its next chapter. Set on North Parade, moments from Bath’s most historic sites, the Abbey Hotel is an enviable address in the city – and a destination in itself.
