All Jungle Bay staff survived.However, the surrounding villages were significantly affected by this natural disaster. As a result, all former Jungle Bay staff will lose their livelihoods. The 35-cottage Jungle Bay spa and wellness resort is now permanently closed and estimates of damage are still being assessed.Petite Savanne, a nearby village where many Jungle Bay staff lived, suffered the greatest loss of life. While the official death toll is still unknown, loss of life is believed to be around 20 persons including relatives of Jungle Bay staff. One employee alone lost 13 relatives in the mudslides. The remaining population of Petite Savanne was evacuated by helicopter and sea, as the area was deemed unstable. They will be permanently relocated.\"This unfortunate disaster has shattered the lives of all our employees, but especially those from Petite Savanne. They must now restart their lives. In addition to having lost their homes, all possessions, and family, they also have lost their livelihood. Jungle Bay too was destroyed and will be unable to re-open\", said Samuel Raphael the Developer and Managing Director who was bestowed the 2010 Best in Personal Contribution to Responsible Tourism by Virgin Holidays Travel Awards.\"10 years ago this year, Jungle Bay opened as a noble concept. At its core was a group of passionate hard working individuals who believed in the power of community. These individuals represented former banana farmers and construction workers, housewives, and inexperienced youth from nearby villages. With training and dedication, they evolved to become a family of compassionate, professional individuals, united in the purpose to exceed international visitors expectations as evident in Jungle Bay's numerous accolades\" says Samuel from a disaster recovery center in Roseau Dominica.Around 100 families have dedicated themselves to making Jungle Bay the leading Caribbean sustainable tourism model including 56 staff, farmers, fishermen and service providers. \"We call ourselves the Jungle Bay family\" and live by the simple motto that \"our job is to make every guest happy\".Local residents are posting messages of sorrow online: \"Jungle Bay, the economic engine of our community is gone\".Fund raising has been launched http://www.gofundme.com/JBDominicaRelief Further info http://www.junglebaydominica.com Valere Tjolle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:29:13.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
