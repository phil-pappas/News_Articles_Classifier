The game now bears little resemblance to the one first played at Rugby School in 1823. Originally, a try as we now know it counted for nothing unless the subsequent kick went through the uprights and over the crossbar for a “goal”. Indeed, Scotland won the first Test, against England in 1871, by one goal to nil. Unconverted tries began to count in 1886, first for one point, then two (1891), three (1893), four (1971) and finally the five we have now (1992). Laws have frequently changed to make the game more open and benefit player safety. Watch the famous Barbarians v New Zealand game from 1973 and the lineouts are a crowded mess. Originally, a try as we now know it counted for nothing unless the subsequent kick went through the uprights and over the crossbar Opposing players now have to stand a certain distance apart and can be lifted by teammates. Likewise, scrum laws were changed in 2013 to improve safety for forwards. Second-tier clubs in Wales are experimenting this season with tries worth six points and penalties and drop goals only two. World Rugby, the governing body, is considering changes to the tackle law to try to limit concussion incidents. Perhaps the biggest change came in 1995 when the game embraced professional. There was a time when amateur players accepting payment would be banned from the game for life. Now the best in the world are handsomely rewarded. • For more information on health and lifestyle, visit vitality.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:42:08.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
