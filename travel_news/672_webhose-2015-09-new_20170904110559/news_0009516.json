Tram line: 3 Features: Dog-free grassy area separated by water from a virtual doggie playground; basketball courts; table-tennis facilities; enclosed playground for children; beautiful monument (pictured above). Dozens of restaurants and cafés nearby. Attracts visitors and locals, including students and young professionals that have migrated to the up-and-coming Pijp area. Ideal for a quick stroll or for picnicking with your goodies from the nearby Albert Cuyp Market (park's smaller size makes playing soccer or throwing frisbee iffy). The elaborate fountain-ringed monument features a bronze bust of Dutch doctor, physician and city planner Samuel Sarphati, the park's namesake.
