The former Jeppesen Services Update Manager (JSUM) is now available as JDM for Windows and is being released in a phased approach across the Jeppesen large avionics data services customer base to ensure a seamless transition.\nJDM for Windows provides customers with a redesigned interface that is based on the latest user design principles and direct pilot interaction. The new Web-based user interface features improvements with design framework, graphics and workflow capabilities. A drag-and-drop feature allows for simplified movement of information on-screen, while enhanced filtering by aircraft and custom folders will enhance efficiency for pilots.\n\"Introducing JDM for Windows will improve the data interaction experience for pilots and will simplify the flying experience for those using Jeppesen data with avionics systems,\" said Mike Abbott , director, Jeppesen Navigation and Flight Deck Programs. \"Following our previous introduction of JDM for Macintosh users, JDM for Windows will complete our transition from the former JSUM system with dynamic new capabilities and design features based on direct feedback from the pilot community.\"\nThe transition to JDM for Windows for customers will be a seamless experience, as the new service will be integrated through a software version update, replacing the former JSUM program. In a phased approach, certain avionics system customers will receive the new service through the software update process during a specific timeframe, to ensure a smooth transition. Jeppesen offers separate JDM for Mac and Windows applications to serve the avionics pilot community, while a JDM Pro application provides database operations and management capabilities for airlines and other large operators using mobile services and electronic flight bag technology.\nThe JDM for Windows application provides the gateway for pilots to keep their avionics services up to date, supporting subscriptions to Jeppesen's industry-leading terminal charts for avionics displays, NavData, obstacle, cultural, airport and terrain data, which is updated each revision cycle.\nMore details on the new JDM for Windows service are available by visiting www.jeppesen.com/JDM .
