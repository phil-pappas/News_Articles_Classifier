The QTA plays a critical role in growing the economic contribution of tourism in the country, and the hotel sector is an important element in the plan. With significant growth projected in the Qatari hotel industry, it is great to see an organization committed to optimizing the hotel offerings that the destination provides. STR Global looks forward to contributing to that effort by providing the QTA and the hospitality industry of Qatar with performance data to best measure and analyse hotel trends”.\nYear-to-date through July 2015, the Qatari hotel industry experienced year-over-year increases in both average daily rate and revenue per available. Over that span, ADR was up 11.0% to QAR728.69, and RevPAR increased 7.2% to QAR510.24.\nSTR Global’s Census Database shows 133 properties totalling 18,733 rooms in Qatar.\nAccording to the August 2015 STR Global Construction Pipeline Report, Qatar ranks third amongst countries in the Middle East with more than 7,000 rooms In Construction and nearly 11,000 rooms Under Contract. Under Contract data includes projects in the In Construction, Final Planning and Planning stages but does not include projects in the Unconfirmed stage.\n“STR Global’s standardised worldwide platform will provide analysis that enables us to see changes in supply and demand from season to season, month to month and even day to day”, said Hassan Al Ibrahim, the QTA’s chief tourism and development officer. “The reports, generated with consistency, quality and complete transparency, will feed back to individual hotels and to QTA, boosting our collective ability to draw insights and make informed decisions on planning and promotion activities. This new vehicle for measuring performance is of immense value to those in the public and private sector working to achieve a more sustainable and mature tourism industry, and I urge all hotels to continue submitting their statistics, through STR Global, for their benefit and the benefit of the sector”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:19:52.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
