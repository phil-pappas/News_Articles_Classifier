Spending from these visitors is expected to be up 7 per cent, reaching $1.3 billion.\nThe fall season is historically the second busiest season in the state, attracting more than 25 per cent of all visitors to New Hampshire annually.\nMost visitors come from the New England and mid-Atlantic markets. The state is expected to see an increase this fall in overnight visits from more distant states, including Florida, California, Illinois and Texas. Low gas prices are helping the expected increase.\nVisitors are encouraged to share their fall foliage images with New Hampshire's tourism division on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, by using the hashtag #nhfoliage.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.visitnh.gov\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:25:55.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
