Southwark Cathedral will be celebrating this most British of traditions with the Big Southwark Sunday Roast on Sunday 4 October, the last day of British Roast Dinner Week. \nAlso coinciding with the end of British Food Fortnight, the focus will be on top quality British ingredients prepared by a talented team of chefs from Elior, Southwark Cathedral’s catering partner. Diners will have a choice of two meats, either Suffolk roast chicken or Suffolk leg of pork with crackling. Each roast meat comes with all the trimmings, including duck fat roasted potatoes, homemade Yorkshire puddings, honey roasted parsnips, roasted beetroot, carrots, broccoli, peas, cheese sauce and gravy. There will also be a range of traditional English desserts available, all homemade by in-house pastry chef Judith, including sticky toffee pudding, bread and butter pudding, seasonal fruit crumble and Victoria sponge cake. Pierre Hermenault from Elior said: “The Sunday roast is the perfect excuse for families and friends to come together at the end of the week and enjoy a true British tradition. With British Roast Dinner Week and British Food Fortnight both taking place in the first week of October, what better time to honour the fantastic local meats, fruits and vegetables being grown and produced here in the UK by launching the new Southwark Sunday Roast. People can come into the Southwark Cathedral refectory from 12pm onwards to enjoy a delicious roast dinner for a great price, and celebrate the best of British.” The Big Southwark Sunday Roast will be served from 12pm to 4pm and will cost just £8.50 for one course or £10 for two. The roast dinner menu will continue to be served every Sunday with two of the following four meats available each week: Suffolk roast chicken, Suffolk leg of pork with crackling, Norfolk turkey breast joint and Gressingham duck leg.
