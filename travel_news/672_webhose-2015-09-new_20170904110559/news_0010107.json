According to Atlas Obscura , the enormous domed residence was originally built by architect William Nicholson in 1976, then revamped in the late eighties. In 2000, the exterior was painted orange giving it the characteristic look from which its nickname stems. Proving that sometimes you should totally judge a book by its cover, the inside doesn't disappoint either:\nAnd now we have good news, in case you’ve ever wanted to live in a cartoon fantasyland (and who doesn't?): Curbed San Francisco reports that the famed house is up for sale and listed with Alain Pinel Realtors . For a mere $4.2 million, you can live in one of the most bizarre and legendary houses on the planet. Just think of the fucking amazing MTV Cribs episode you could host here. (Side note: MTV should reboot MTV Cribs .)\nAs far as we can tell, it’s BYO dinosaur.\nPhotos: Facebook.com/rachni", "external_links": ["http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/flintstone-house-hillsborough", "http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2015/09/01/hillsboroughs_flintstone_house_hits_the_market_allegedly_asks_for_42m.php", "https://www.facebook.com/rachni/posts/10153465997880041?pnref=story", "http://www.apr.com/"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:55:51.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
