Auto makers are turning to suppliers like Honeywell to meet the unique needs of fuel-efficient 3-cylinder engines, increase power from 4-cylinder engines with advanced aerodynamics, and soon deliver electric boosting and energy recovery systems for advanced hybrid powertrains.\"\nTechnology Themes of Honeywell's 2015 Forecast\nAdoption of turbocharged 3-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines is emerging as a huge growth trend globally for fuel efficient entry-level and mid-range vehicles. Honeywell sees an industry compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 30 percent through 2020 resulting in sales of 7 million 3-cylinder turbocharged engines by 2020. Honeywell's Gen3 gasoline turbocharger range is optimized to withstand the higher loads generated by the 3-cylinder configuration. Globally, 4-cylinder engines will continue to represent 75 percent of the turbocharged light vehicle industry in 2020. Honeywell forecasts this turbo engine family will have a 7 percent CAGR through 2020. For this category, Honeywell technologies such as variable geometry (VNT), Twin Scroll, Mixed-Flow, Ball Bearings and DualBoost ™ will help auto makers improve engine power without sacrificing transient response. Multi-stage boosting for diesel engines is another key innovation to help auto makers achieve greater engine performance, without breaching fuel economy regulations. By 2020 more than 2 million light new vehicles per year will be launched with multi-stage boosting systems. Honeywell is preparing to launch the industry's first two-stage application with two variable geometry turbos combined in series for ultimate power density and response. Globally, diesel engines will retain an important share of light vehicle sales at nearly 20 percent, due to their lower fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. In particular, Honeywell expects diesel penetration to double in North America to 7 percent by 2020, enabled by the latest clean diesel turbocharging and after-treatment technologies. Penetration of hybrid powertrains , including 'plug-ins', will be up 4 points to 7 percent of the global light vehicle market. Approximately 25 percent of these vehicles will use turbocharged engines, compared to 10 percent today, opening the door to potential future enhancement with electric boosting and energy recovery. In contrast, battery electric vehicles are expected to be only 1 percent of global light vehicle sales in 2020 due to high battery costs and limited range between charges. Quote: s\n\"Turbo penetration continues to grow as auto makers develop global engine programs which can fill needs in multiple markets. Consumers are adopting fast, and expect the highest levels of quality and reliability. We started implementing the Honeywell Operating System (HOS) more than 10 years ago to deliver consistent quality and continuous improvement from all of our locations around the world with rigorous supply-chain oversight.\"\nTerrence Hahn , Honeywell Transportation Systems CEO and President\n\"It's no longer enough to simply downsize the engine and add a turbo. Auto makers need solutions for dynamic conditions where the engine reacts instantly to driver inputs while still controlling fuel consumption and emissions. Key design features of the latest generation of Honeywell turbochargers make them more reactive to engine control signals. Honeywell is also supporting this shift with our OnRAMP engine control software that enables manufacturers to test and optimize their engines in transient conditions.\"\nCraig Balis , Honeywell Transportation Systems Chief Technology Officer\n\"Consumers in all regions expect performance and fuel economy, and are rapidly switching to turbocharged vehicles. Honeywell continues to develop its worldwide engineering and manufacturing presence to help our customers handle the complexity of global launches. We are building in added flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs through application of the Honeywell User Experience which informs the way we make all our products easier to install, use and maintain.\"\nPeter Hill , Honeywell Transportation Systems VP Marketing and Product Management Supporting Resources\nRead more about Honeywell Transportation Systems Follow @Honeywell_Turbo on Twitter Subscribe to Honeywell's Corporate RSS feed About Honeywell Aerospace\nHoneywell Aerospace products and services are found on virtually every commercial, defense and space aircraft, and its turbochargers are used by nearly every automaker and truck manufacturer around the world.
