In addition to contributing an estimated $6.2 million in direct spending to the BC economy, the convention represents millions of dollars of potential future meetings business for Vancouver. In order to generate excitement and stimulate registrations, the Vancouver Convention Centre, Tourism Vancouver and the PCMA Local Host Committee collaborated on a cheeky video, which launched today. The playful video riffs off Convening Leaders’ theme of “Cultivating Creative Moments” by telling the story of PCMA’s first site visit to Vancouver. The twist? The cast consists solely of children, playing on the creative and youthful energy of Vancouver and its meetings industry. The local Host Committee, consisting of members from the Convention Centre, Tourism Vancouver, hotels and hospitality partners, has been working tirelessly with PCMA over the last year to plan this important event. Highlights include an opening reception at BC Place Stadium, featuring Vancouver’s innovative culinary scene, and a closing event at the Vancouver Convention Centre themed “come home before you go home” that offers Vancouver-style hospitality in a fun and informal atmosphere. Deborah Sexton, PCMA President and CEO, commented, “The LEED® Platinum certified Vancouver Convention Centre, located on the waterfront in the heart of downtown Vancouver, is the perfect venue for Convening Leaders. Our participants and partners attend this event to not only learn and network, but also to experience the location for their own future meetings. This is the first time PCMA will be holding this program in Vancouver; discovering the city’s unique attributes and vibe will be of extreme interest to PCMA’s diverse audiences.” Claire Smith, Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Vancouver Convention Centre and Co-Chair of the Vancouver Host Committee, said, “Hosting the best and brightest in our industry is a tremendous opportunity – PCMA Convening Leaders will be the largest site inspection in Vancouver’s history. Influential decision makers from across North America and around the world will experience Vancouver and our facility first-hand and learn why we are a leading destination for meetings and conventions – one that continues to attract the pinnacle of events, of which we are now proud to include Convening Leaders.” Dave Gazley, Vice President of Meeting and Convention Sales, Tourism Vancouver and Co-Chair of the Vancouver Host Committee, commented, “Bidding on and securing citywide conventions is a highly competitive business – when Vancouver welcomes Convening Leaders in January, we’ll have the sustained attention of the world’s foremost meeting and convention professionals, as well as our industry colleagues. PCMA’s annual meeting puts a spotlight, and microscope, on the host destination. It is an incredible opportunity for Vancouver to pull out all the stops and demonstrate the skill, creativity and passion we put into hosting meetings, conventions and events.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T12:47:37.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
