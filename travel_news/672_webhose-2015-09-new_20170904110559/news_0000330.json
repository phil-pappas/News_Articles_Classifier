This policy is making airlines billions, time for trains to follow this money making opportunity. \nThe passenger train operator says that on Thursday that it will start charging $20 to passengers who exceed restrictions for carry-on and personal items. \nCustomers are allowed to bring two personal items weighing up to 25 pounds and two carry-on bags weighing no more than 50 pounds. The fee applies to each item above those limits. \nU.S. airlines started introducing bag fees in 2008 and now charge a standard fee of $25 for the first checked suitcase. \nThe fees are more extensive than what Amtrak plans. They generated $1.6 billion for the airlines in the first quarter of this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T21:51:02.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
