As centerpiece of a 570-square-metre (6,135-square-feet) retreat, the traditional villa now includes a spacious deck and bale that surrounds a 60-square-metre (645-square-foot) swimming pool. \nThe two-bedroom abode features private en-suites, with the master bath emerging from the makeover with a secluded, sunken outdoor Jacuzzi. A museum-worthy collection of art and artifacts grace the white-washed brick walls and complement the modern Balinese furnishings of this completely private residence. “It’s a sanctuary within a sanctuary,” said the hotel’s general manager, Alain Bachmann. “The place turned out so well, I’m not sure there wasn’t a little magic stirred into all that carpentry.” One of Indonesia’s foremost architects and art patrons, Hadiprana built the property as a family estate in the early 1980s before the luxury hotel group GHM assumed stewardship in 2004.
