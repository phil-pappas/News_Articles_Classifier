Average daily rate for the week was down 1.2% to US$116.07. Revenue per available room dropped 7.5% to finish the week at US$74.03.\n“RevPAR growth for Sunday was strong due to transient travel over the Labor Day weekend,” said Brad Garner, STR’s senior VP for client relationships. “However, that growth dropped sharply on Monday and Tuesday due to a lack of business travel around Labor Day. As the week progressed, the numbers gradually improved.”\nAmong the Top 25 Markets, Norfolk/Virginia Beach, Virginia, reported the only double-digit increases in ADR (+14.2% to US$98.91) and RevPAR (+17.0% to US$54.79).\nOrlando, Florida, saw the largest rise in occupancy, up 5.7% to 60.7%.\nOverall, four markets reported increases in occupancy, five posted increases in RevPAR, and seven markets posted an increase in ADR.\nChicago, Illinois, experienced the steepest declines in each of the three key performance metrics. Occupancy in the market dropped 23.4% to 67.6%; ADR was down 22.1% to US$136.65; and RevPAR decreased 40.3% to US$92.42.\nTwo additional markets reported double-digit decreases across the three key performance measurements.\nIn Houston, Texas, occupancy decreased 20.8% to 56.8%; ADR dropped 11.9% to US$96.82; and RevPAR fell 30.2% to US$55.02.\nIn Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia, occupancy dropped 16.8% to 64.1%; ADR was down 17.4% to US$136.57; and RevPAR decreased 31.3% to US$87.55.\nSource: STR.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:47:47.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
