Promoted stories \n“This situation is only too common. I wondered if we, as a government, could bring any pressure on bus providers to ensure they stop abandoning the less profitable routes, in favour of only those commercially viable.” \nCampaigners are trying to get the number 13 route reinstated in Harefield \nRoyston added: “Huge numbers of Southampton’s residents rely on buses to get them from A to B, and the continued upheaval of bus routes in our city is having a profound effect on local people. \n“It cannot be right that bus companies can cherry pick only the most profitable routes and abandon those that are less profitable or break-even. Share article \n\"Add into this mix that nationally bus companies receive millions of pounds of taxpayer’s money to provide these services, we should expect, demand and receive more. \n“It is totally unacceptable that large areas of Southampton have so little in the way of decent bus services. I will continue to work to ensure Southampton’s residents get the best possible bus service.” Promoted Stories Southampton Itchen MP Royston Smith has backed a campaign to reinstate the number 13 service in Harefield Sorry, an error occurred.
