There is so much to do for families, kids, and adults alike. Jeanette Bunn, Travel To Go President , encourages travelers to leave the kids with a sitter and enjoy some grown-up adventures while visiting Sin City. Remember, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas! 1. Zumanity – Cirque du Soleil pulls out all of the stops with this seductive twist on reality. Only at the New York, New York Hotel and Casino, Zumanity makes the proactive playful and makes the forbidden exciting. A combination of burlesque and cabaret, this production includes breathtaking acrobatics in the theme of Cirque. Past participants describe their experience as “amazing, fun, hot,” and “some of the most beautiful things you may ever see on stage.” Don’t miss this experience!\n2. Absinthe – The cast and crew of Absinthe are prepared to transport audiences from the white tent in front of Caesars Palace to the Moulin Rouge with a night of adults-only laughter. The Gazzillionare and his trusty assistant Joy Jenkins host a cast of comedic eccentrics who preform jaw-dropping acts ranging from burlesque style stripteases to tightrope acrobatics to amazing feats of strength. Jeanette Bunn of Travel To Go knows this sexy cast is full of humor that will have audiences laughing well after the show’s conclusion.\n3. Pin Up – Get ready for swinging big band music and a feature performance by 2011 Playmate of the Year Clair Sinclair at the Stratosphere. The days of pin up girls are brought back to center stage in this Betty Page inspired production. Playful choreography by Lacey Schwimmer of “Dancing with the Stars” accompanies music by Frankie Moreno. A collection of talented singers and a live six-piece band with a phenomenal horn section brings the show straight to the top of a must-see list.\n4. Baz – Another Cirque du Soleil production, For the Record: BAZ, features favorite memories of the shows of Baz Luhrmann. A live band and seven of the best performers in the world come together to recreate the magic, music, and imagery that audiences have come to expect from Baz Luhrmann productions. Scenes from “Romeo & Juliet,” “Moulin Rouge,” and “The Great Gatsby” are taken to a new level in this post-modern cabaret style show, taking place at LIGHT nightclub inside Mandalay Bay.\nA night of amazing entertainment is ready and waiting.
