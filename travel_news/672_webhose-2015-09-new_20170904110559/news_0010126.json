The Eddie Bauer Daisy Wrap fits into that category. The soft and lightweight wrap contains fabric that allows for some stretch, and also wicks moisture for comfort. The polyester/Tencel lyocell/spandex blend is wrinkle resistant, which means you can roll or fold it with abandon, as well as avoid the hotel room iron. It’s easy to toss in the washing machine or your hotel room sink, and dries relatively quickly. Wear it on city streets, to yoga class, out to dinner, on the airplane, or even as a beach cover-up, and you’re set.
