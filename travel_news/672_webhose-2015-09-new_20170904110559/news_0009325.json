Add in this fall's drop in airline ticket prices, and the savings opportunities become even more appealing. So, how could you possibly add to the value of such a vacation? You have only to research the food festivals at your chosen destination. \nThese events are full of flavor and frugal fun. Even those with entry tickets offer significant savings off the total standard costs of the typical food, beverage and music attractions available. Factor in the festive atmosphere and the convenience of having everything in one location, and it becomes almost impossible to say no. Here are a handful of my favorites from around the country. \nAs a veggie fan from way back, I do love any event that celebrates a plant-strong menu. A fun and unusual one in California's Sonoma County is the annual Kendall Jackson Heirloom Tomato Festival. Tickets include alternative Creole performances by a Grammy-nominated artist, drink vouchers, and food samples of tasty tomato concoctions from roughly 50 area culinary purveyors and chefs. Scheduled for Sept. 26 in the town of Fulton, the event runs from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. \nMushroom lovers will find lots to love during October and early November on Washington's Long Beach Peninsula. The area's popular Wild Mushroom Celebration is several weeks long and features multiple opportunities to experience specially prepared wine dinners, beer-pairing menus, seasonal dishes and more, all focused on the numerous types of wild mushrooms that grow in the area. \nEast Coast veg heads may want to check out Bethania, North Carolina's annual Black Walnut Festival. The Sept. 28 event will feature a black walnut recipe contest, fun run, artisan crafts, black walnut ice cream and more. Free shuttle service from a designated parking area will be provided. \nIf seafood is more your speed, head down to the Sunshine State for the Naples Stone Crab Festival scheduled for Oct. 23-25. The event's sixth year celebration will feature live music, boat rides, the ceremonial cracking of the claw and more along the town's waterfront area near the popular Tin City district. \nCarnivores in search of a food festival they can sink their teeth into won't want to miss Santa Fe's annual Green Chile Cheeseburger Smackdown scheduled for Sept. 10. City chefs compete against each other and are judged not only by a panel of food industry experts, but the public as well. General admission tickets include a tasting of all cheeseburger finalists' creations and glassware for the wine and beer samples. Full beverages can be purchased separately. Join the conversation and share your voice. \nShow Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T00:07:48.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
