Times' theme park newsletter. I'm Funland theme park blogger Brady MacDonald , and this week we take a peek at a new Legoland dark ride, test-drive a coaster with VR headsets and tour a Knott’s haunted maze. Subscribe to the newsletter Ninjago \nA first-of-its-kind dark ride coming to Legoland California in 2016 will let riders use karate-chop hand gestures to shoot fireballs at ninja warriors on giant video screens. \nThe high-tech Ninjago: The Ride will feature sensors on the front of each ride vehicle that register the hand movements of riders who zap color-coded fireballs at digital screens populated with animated Lego figures. (Legoland) Horror Nights \nI review Halloween Horror Nights and find that Universal Studios Hollywood has fine-tuned the annual event into a well-oiled killing machine with a stellar lineup of haunted mazes. \nThe Crimson Peak maze at Horror Nights also serves as a living movie trailer for the upcoming dark fantasy directed by Guillermo del Toro, opening in theaters Oct. 16. (Universal) Virtual reality \nIn hopes of turning the virtual into reality, Cedar Fair is testing a VR headset on the Thunder Run coaster before and after park hours at Canada’s Wonderland outside Toronto. (VR Coaster) Paranormal Inc. \nI take a walk through Paranormal Inc. with Halloween Haunt scenic designer and maze maker Jon Cooke and find the new maze to be the best I’ve experienced at Knott’s Berry Farm in nearly a decade. (Knott's) Dapper Days \nDapper Days returns to Disneyland, and we collect our favorite photos of those who like to step out in style at the Dappiest Place on Earth. (Christina House / For The Times) Bad joke \nA Florida man is banned for life from the Walt Disney World resort after making a joke about building a “meth lab” in his Pop Century hotel room. David Swindler tells First Coast News: “I should have said, 'I was going to build an atomic bomb,' or something else.” Alton Towers \nMerlin Entertainments announces an 11.4% drop in theme park attendance as visitors stayed away from the United Kingdom’s Alton Towers after a serious coaster crash in June that resulted in leg amputations for two riders. Great Wolf Lodge \nThe currently under-construction Great Wolf Lodge in Garden Grove will start taking reservations in October for the grand opening next spring of the indoor water park resort. (Great Wolf Lodge) And finally \nEver wondered what Ohio’s abandoned Geauga Lake amusement park looks like after being closed for nearly a decade? Check out this drone flyover video .
