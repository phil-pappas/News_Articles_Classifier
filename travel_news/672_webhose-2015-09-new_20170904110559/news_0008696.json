That confirms the €30m Thomas Himmel-designed 7,240-yards, par-70 course as the eighth-best in Spain - a fantastic achievement for a course opened only in 2007 on an island more famed for its holiday beaches than its golf. \nThe magazine stated: \"Tough, but aesthetically pleasing. Majorca's (sic) No1 is the epitome of a high-calibre modern championship course.\" Son Gual was acclaimed earlier this year as ‘best golf course' by the World of Leading Golf, a corporation representing some of the globe's most distinctive clubs and has also been nominated for the award of Spain's best golf course in the forthcoming World Golf Awards. Golf Son Gual's general manager, Andreas Pamer, said: \"The Golf World Top 100 is regarded by many as the benchmark ranking for European golf and to once again be acclaimed as Mallorca's number one - and the eight best in Spain - is a great honour, especially as we've moved up two places while several other household names have dropped. \"It is part of our long-term plan to maintain and improve upon our rankings year on year, but, above all, our ethos is all about providing the best possible golfing experience for members, their guests and visitors. And this latest accolade suggests we're achieving that aim.\" The multi-award-winning Golf Son Gual is located just 15km from Palma de Mallorca Airport and green fees start at just €89.
