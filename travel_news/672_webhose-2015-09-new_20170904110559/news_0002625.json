Discovered 75 years ago, the hot springs have become a major hit with ailing tourists.\nNorma, an elderly woman from Canelones, located 500 kilometers (310 miles) to the south is suffering from arthrosis and therefore pays a visit to Dayman hot springs.\n“They are said to have many properties,” Norma said as she soaked in one of the outdoor pools at the Dayman hot springs.\n“I have arthrosis and the doctor recommended the waters to me. They are very good,” Norma told EFE. “In the winter, I come here up to eight times. In the summer, I go to the beach.”\nDayman is one of six hot springs in Uruguay’s so-called Thermal Region in Salto and neighboring Paysandu province, both in the northwest along Uruguay’s namesake river and natural border with Argentina.\nThe springs, flowing from the Guarani aquifer that runs under parts of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, produce about 160,000 liters (42,270 gallons) of water from roughly 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) underground, with temperatures ranging from 38 C to 46 C (100 F to 114 F).\nNow, all the hot springs have public and private facilities, offering a variety of services, indoor and outdoor pools, water parks and accommodations ranging from economy class lodging to five-star hotels.\nSalto Tourism Director Gustavo Chiriff told EFE that ANCAP teams were exploring for oil some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the province’s capital in a military field near what is now known as Termas Arapey, when they suddenly spotted a burst of water on that date in 1941.\nIn the 1970s, hotels were constructed, making Arapey and the other hot springs more attractive as tourist destinations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:26:33.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
