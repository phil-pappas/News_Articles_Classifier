But the Chinese still want to travel and give their kids a better education. Growth in the world's second-largest economy is decelerating and rattling financial markets around the world. Behind that slowdown is an evolutionary shift in China's economy— from a dependence on exports and investment in factories and housing — to a reliance on spending by its emerging middle class. That transition, a gradual and perhaps painful one, will affect which U.S. companies stand to benefit and which will be squeezed as China's growth slides from the double-digit annual rates of the mid-2000s to 7 percent, 6 percent, maybe even less. ___ United says CEO Jeff Smisek is out, effective immediately The chairman and CEO of United Airlines is stepping down in connection with an investigation into dealings with the agency that operates New York-area airports. United Continental Holdings Inc. said Tuesday that Jeff Smisek and two other senior executives had resigned and railroad executive Oscar Munoz was named CEO and president. United disclosed earlier this year that the company and some of its executives had received subpoenas from a federal grand jury for information about dealings with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. United said it was conducting its own internal investigation. ___ Apple event to focus on new iPhones, Apple TV and Siri SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Hey, Siri, what does Apple have in store for us this week? Along with new iPhones, the iconic tech company is expected to show off a new Apple TV system and a bigger role in the home for Siri, its voice-activated digital assistant. After a series of high-profile Apple launches over the past year — super-sized iPhones, a digital wallet, a sleek smartwatch — analysts say this week's news might not seem as dramatic. But the event could reveal more about the company's strategy and its aspirations to be an indispensable part of daily life. 1 of 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:02:44.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
