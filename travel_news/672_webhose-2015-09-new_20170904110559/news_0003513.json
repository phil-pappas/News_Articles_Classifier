But that would likely be offset by margin pressure from higher wages, pub improvements and supermarket competition, meaning profits would be similar to, or slightly above, that achieved in 2014/15. \nUnderlying sales in the first 6 weeks of its new fiscal year were up 1.4 percent, with total sales up 5.2 percent, it said. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Wetherspoon closed at 720 pence on Thursday, down 4 percent on a year ago, valuing it at 855 million pounds. \n($1 = 0.6474 pounds) (Reporting by Neil Maidment.
