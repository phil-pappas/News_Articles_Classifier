When she graduated Girls’ High, she was awarded a four-year scholarship to attend any public college in the United States. After attending Indiana University for one year, she married her young love, Leon, and later got her degree in special education from Georgia State University. She lovingly taught and inspired kindergarten students for 20 years at the Ahavath Achim (AA) preschool (later to become the Epstein School). Betty’s leadership roles included serving as president of the Atlanta chapter of Hadassah as well as being an officer of the AA Synagogue Sisterhood. She was actively involved in her children’s lives and regularly volunteered in the PTA at Margaret Mitchell Elementary School, which her four children attended.\nHer symbiotic love for her husband of 67 years continued to grow as they adored each other’s company and shared interests. Betty and Leon were lifelong learners and avid readers. They attended Elderhostel (now Road Scholar) and B’nai B’rith Learning Institute for many years. She enjoyed attending Shabbat services at AA Synagogue and the study group. They traveled all over the world.\nFamily mattered the most, and she always enjoyed being with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren every year at Lake Lanier during the summer and at Hilton Head Island during Thanksgiving week. She enjoyed celebrating Shabbat and Jewish holidays surrounded by her loved ones. She was liked, respected and admired by all who knew her.\nBetty was preceded in death by her parents, Sadye and Morris Cohen; brothers Bernard W. Cohen (Rae Alice) and Gerald Cohen (Helen); and son-in-law Sam Schatten. She is survived by her husband, Leon Goldstein; children Bobby Goldstein (Liz), Steven Goldstein (Karen), Gail Goldstein Heyman (Lyons Jr.) and Janet Schatten (Richard Friedman); grandchildren Adam Goldstein (Kim), Sherri Nighbert (James), Mindy Goldstein, Blair Beasley (Zack), Jared and Scott Heyman, Carly Heyman Godzdanker (Roy), Jeff Schatten (Kimary), and Alan, Todd and Michael Schatten; five great-grandchildren; sister Harriet Miller; sister-in-law Betty Ann Shusterman; and many nieces, nephews and cousins.\nSign the online guestbook at www.edressler.com .
