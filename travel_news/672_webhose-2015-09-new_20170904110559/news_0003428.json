The Vortex offers corporate clients a new, contemporary, multi-use zone to inspire creative thinking. Accommodating up to 40 guests, it can easily be transformed from a more typical meeting room to a less conventional and inspirational space that’s conducive to free-flowing exchange of ideas between colleagues and clients. \nSwap chairs and tables for bean bags, seize the flood of new thinking inspired by the bespoke imagery of the wallpaper, dream up award-winning strategies or simply relax, team together, by sharing a private film viewing. The Vortex boasts state-of-the-art in-built AV facilities - including a smart TV which is hidden by artwork when not in use – and a unique design concept. Décor has the power to inspire, impress and motivate, and Seaham Hall has worked closely with designer Louise James of Koncept ID to create a space that is both stimulating and professional. Inspiration has been taken directly from the iconic water feature at the front of the hotel that shares its name with the new space; the vortex of swirling water is replicated in the bespoke carpet design. The hotel’s location by the sea is reflected in the wallpaper, which features illustrations of giant jellyfish. All is combined with a slick contemporary twist on a grand Georgian Break-Front bookcase, which houses games and puzzles such as Connect 4 and Rubik’s cubes, and conceals a drinks fridge and technical equipment, while complementing the impressive historical* context of the building. (*The poet Lord Byron was married at Seaham Hall in 1815, and his daughter, Lady Ada Lovelace, whose 200th birth anniversary is celebrated on 10th December 2015, is now regarded as one of the founders of scientific computing). Team-building activities: Following recently-established partnerships with two local companies – Valley Adventures and Karting North East – Seaham Hall has built upon existing activities on offer for corporate parties. Within its own grounds, Seaham Hall can now offer a wide range of team-building activities, including falconry, treasure hunts, bush craft and cookery classes. In addition, Valley Adventures offers archery, paddle-boarding, surfing, scavenger hunts, coastal discovery days, orienteering, circus skills, military-style assault courses and raft building, while Karting North East offers professional Karting experiences, plus paintball, rage rally, archery, tomahawks and off-road 4x4 driving. CORPORATE PACKAGES: The Day Delegate Rate for The Vortex starts from £55 pp inclusive of VAT, which includes the use of the main meeting room, refreshments on arrival and mid-morning, two-course lunch or working buffet lunch, afternoon tea, AV equipment, complimentary parking and WIFI. The Residential Delegate Rate starts from £225 pp inclusive of VAT, which includes all of the above, plus an overnight stay in a Junior Suite, a three-course dinner, full English breakfast and use of the 44,000 sq ft Serenity Spa, complete with 20m pool, outdoor hot tubs and a huge range of treatment and massage options.
