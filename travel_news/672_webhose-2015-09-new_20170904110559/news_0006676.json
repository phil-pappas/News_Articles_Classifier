The cooperation will be launched today, and is the result of several months of intensive work.\nYandex will, according to the agreement, display content directly from Dohop alongside its own content, thus giving Yandex users on the Russian market more pricing options.\nYandex is one of the largest internet companies in Europe and operates Russia’s most popular search engine, with about 60% of all search traffic in Russia. Yandex is currently the world’s 19th most visited website and the company also operates in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Turkey. Yandex shares are listed on the Nasdaq stock market and the company’s current market value is roughly 3.7 billion dollars.\nDohop has direct agreements with the world’s leading airlines and online travel agents and, thanks to their unique technology, can find otherwise elusive fares and connections among their extensive vendor database. One of Dohop’s main features is the ability to offer connections of low cost airlines around the world via their Self-Connect options.\n“Our cooperation with Yandex is a big step forward for Dohop. It validates the hard work and innovation we have put into our flight search technology and lets us help an emerging market find and book flights. We are thrilled that Yandex decided to use our solution and look forward to working with them,” says David Gunnarsson, CEO of Dohop.\nSource:-Yandex", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:07:41.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
