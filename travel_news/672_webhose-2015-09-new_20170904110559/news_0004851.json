It can even sometimes be cheaper to buy a first-class single rather than a standard-class ticket. Check your journey up to 12 weeks early: Network Rail must have the timetable set 12 weeks in advance, so operators usually release their cheap advance tickets soon after. You can sign up to alerts from operators to find out when specific advance tickets are available. Most advance tickets are on sale until up to 6pm the day before. Buy a railcard: Most Railcards cost £30 per year - or £70 for three - and cut a third off the price of many tickets. You can even get discounts on a Railcard itself. They are available for families, people aged 16 to 25, those aged over 60, the disabled and any two people travelling together. 'It therefore remains the passenger's responsibility to ensure they're asking for the fare that is best for their particular requirements or at least to instigate the necessary enquiries'.\nThe firm also said if customers want the best deal, they should ask for it specifically.\nThe email continued: 'I realise it would be a more positive experience for our customers if our booking office colleagues do provide any alternatives or extra information at the time of booking … but they are under no obligation to offer anything other than that which has been asked for.'\nA spokesman confirmed the email reflected its policy, which is understood not to be illegal.\nLast night rail minister Claire Perry told The Daily Telegraph train firms 'must get better at giving their customers information about ticket options in a straightforward way'.\nShe said: 'The most important part of the railway is its customers, and they must be able to trust that they are getting the best possible deal every time they travel.\n'If this is not happening it is unacceptable.' Martin Abrams of the Campaign for Better Transport added that passengers were being burdened by a 'hugely overcomplicated' fares system.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next EasyJet flight from London to Turkey is forced to divert...

But buying four separate, single tickets for the route costs just £60.83 – a saving of £68.67.\nThe train has to stop at the stations where all the tickets are valid to and from, but passengers need not get off.\nTrainSplit.com said split tickets aren’t offered at station ticket machines or by any train company websites, and staff are under no obligation to search for them.\nSmartphone app and website TicketySplit, offered by consumer website MoneySavingExpert, also helps to save on fares with split tickets.\nConsumers can use the app to find out if it is cheaper to buy multiple tickets on the same journey without having to change trains.\nTicket splitting is legal in the UK, and the emphasis is on the user to work out how to find the best deal.\nLast year it emerged that self-service ticket machines – used to buy almost a quarter of tickets every year – offer vastly different fares to those bought in a booking office.\nAn investigation found some tickets cost £200 from a machine compared with £100 for the same destination bought elsewhere.\nIt followed calls for an urgent inquiry into 'rip off' ticket machines by the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association union.\nManuel Cortes, the TSSA's general secretary, said in October: 'Millions of rail passengers are paying much higher fares than they should be simply because they are being systematically ripped off at self- service machines.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1PY6DeS", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-29T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:24:58.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
