Supplied \nSoho Basin ski area, near Cardrona, opened without fanfare earlier this winter. \nAccording to consent documents, a base station would be located on a \"gently sloping natural platform\" in the well of the basin and the top station on the edge of a small alpine basin beside Cardrona ski field. \nThe consent material raises the possibility of connecting tracks to the commercial Cardrona ski area, whose previous owners applied to build a chairlift in the basin but the application did not progress in 1997. \nSoho's operators plan to focus on cat skiing and wide open off-piste terrain for the time being. \n\"The site is characteristic of high altitude alpine tussockland of the Wakatipu region. Ad Feedback \n\"The predominant aspect is south-west and southerly, resulting in cooler climatic conditions and longer snow cover. \n\"At this altitude there has been minimal change during human colonisation, less so than lower areas where beech forest has been historically replaced by tussockland and pasture. \n\"The introduction of grazing animals to the alpine landscape has had some degree of change with adaptation and modification of plant species. \n\"The character of this landscape is typified by the emptiness of mountain peaks with wide vistas and long views. \n\"Human intervention is uncommon, apart from the odd high country farm track,\" a Darby Partners landscape assessment says. \nDespite being billed as \"undiscovered,\" the area is not exactly unexplored virgin territory. \nThe basin has been used by back country skiers, heli-ski operators and film units for years but Soho are marketing an exclusive experience appealing to a sense of alpine adventure. \nThe ski area is part of Glencoe Station, a vast high country tract, on land to the west of Cardrona ski field and part of a designated council ski area sub-zone. \nSoho's facilities - for now - include half-day and full day options for up to 24 people, snow cat groomers with heated cabs used for transport around the mountain and charters. \nLunch, from Darby's Amisfield winery, can be provided for guests. \nThe off-piste basin offers 500 metres of vertical drop, compared to 462 metres at Coronet Peak, 357m at The Remarkables, 600m at Cardrona and 700m at Treble Cone. \nRoundhill near Tekapo has the most vertical metres in New Zealand, 783m, closely followed by Turoa at Mt Ruapehu with 722m. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:59:04.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
