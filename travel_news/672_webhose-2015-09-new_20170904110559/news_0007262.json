"text": "Vietnam travel agents join hands with GfK for tourism data Published on : Monday, September 14, 2015\nIn an effort to collect more accurate data and monitor the progress of the travel and tour sector the Vietnam Society of Travel Agents (VISTA) and global market research agency GfK announced a partnership on Thursday.\nUnder the partnership, the two will produce a set of predictive analytics, the first of its kind in Vietnam, thanks to the live, forward-bookings contributed weekly by VISTA\nmembers, GfK said in a press release.\nThe GfK Travelscan, which is based on consolidated and aggregated industry booking\ndata, is used by the travel industry to better anticipate market developments and to help\nbusinesses in the sector run more efficiently, according to GfK.\nTravelscan is one of a suite of specialized solutions for the travel and hospitality industry\ndeveloped by GfK, one of the world’s leading market insights companies.\n“Vietnam unlocks a great potential for the travel and hospitality industry and GfK is very\nglad to have the support of VISTA and its members,” Laurens Van Den Oever, global\nindustry lead for travel & hospitality with the market research agency said.\n“Travelscan will serve to benefit all parties in the tourism sector and we are definitely\nlooking forward to play a key role supporting the further growth of this exciting market.”\nGfK has established similar partnerships in Europe and other parts of the world with Travelscan being accepted as the currency for tourism research in these markets.\nVietnam is the fourth market in Asia Pacific where Travelscan is being launched.\n“The Vietnam Tourism Association (VITA) and VISTA value and appreciate the\nimportance of having real-time travel industry insights,” VISTA president Vu The Binh\nremarked.\n“While our government statistic office are already collecting and publishing Vietnam’s\ngeneral inbound and outbound tourism data each month, we have not yet managed to\nobtain a regular multi-dimension and in-depth report from travel agents—a new and\nvaluable resource that will be provided by GfK Travelscan.”\nTravelscan is already being implemented in Singapore, Malaysia and Australia in the last\ntwo years, with more markets to be added to this list in the near future, according to GfK.\n“GfK’s Travelscan study has already proven its advantage in Europe, and we are excited\nto be able to access similar reports for Vietnam,” Binh said.\n“We are certain that it will help the travel community here gain a better understanding of the travel market, and the actionable insights will help drive strong growth in this dynamic industry.”\nUnder the partnership, the two will produce a set of predictive analytics, the first of its\nkind in Vietnam, thanks to the live,
