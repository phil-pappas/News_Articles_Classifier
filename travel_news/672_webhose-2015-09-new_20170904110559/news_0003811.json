Sadly in the modern world of vehicle rental this can be tantamount to writing a blank check to the rental desk.”\nThe study of around 2,000 respondents showed while eight out of 10 business travellers are “diligent” in checking their hire car for damage before driving, only half check the condition of the wheels and tyres.\nIt also found around half of business travellers had to return their hire car without seeing a hire car representative, because “no-one was available”.\n“When a small chip to the windscreen or a damaged tyre can cost hundreds to fix business travellers need to make sure their companies are protected from unwanted costs by buying excess car hire insurance before they fly,” said CEO and founder of iCarhireinsurance.com.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-09-29T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:55:09.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
