He is a professional, has been doing it for years. The chances of him crashing, even on a tricky Alpine pass, are slim. He was the Stig, for goodness’ sake. He’s not going to get it wrong. But if he does, it will hurt. A lot. Welcome to my world. I’m sitting beside Collins in a BMW 640d M Sport Coupé, which has a top speed of 155mph that he seems intent on reaching. We’re careering around at Millbrook, a closed track that manufacturers use to test their new cars. It normally has a speed limit of 55mph, but the officials have waived that for Collins. He knows how to handle himself, right? 2min 30sec The time it took Collins to complete his lap of the secret circuit, according to the production team’s unofficial timekeeping He certainly does. With a full tank of Shell’s V-Power Nitro+ Diesel, its best performance fuel , we’re ready to go. The two and a half minutes I spend clinging to the BMW’s passenger seat are among the most frightening, exhilarating and memorable of my life. He waggles the steering wheel with the same abandon that my son employs when I let him pretend to drive my car. But there’s never the slightest thought that the man who performed stunts in the last James Bond movie will lose control. That’s a lie, actually. It’s pretty much all I can think about as Collins unleashes every last drop of the Bimmer’s 313bhp on the glistening asphalt. But when I recover my rationality, I realise that he is firmly in control. Probably keeping a bit in reserve so as not to scare the wimpish journalist, in fact. Probably could complete the circuit in half the time without me holding him back. Even so, the lap feels fast enough from where I’m sitting. The tyres squeal like newborn piglets, and the turbo diesel engine revs with the timbre of a true sports car. About halfway around, Collins turns his cherubic face to me and asks: “You all right, Tim?” “No,” I scream. 3.98km Circuit length Ben Collins completed with motoring journalist Tim Gibson for the unique virtual-reality online film “I’ve never been more scared in my life. And stop turning around. Look at the road.” Of course, that’s not what I actually say. Instead, I reply with a nonchalant, “Yeah, fine Ben. This is great.” I don’t think he’s fooled. This is the striking thing about racing drivers such as Collins. They simply don’t get rattled, even when they’re engaged in an activity that feels akin to riding on the world’s fastest rollercoaster while trying to thread a needle and cotton. They can focus on steering, gear changes, power delivery, braking and navigation, all while holding a conversation. I, on the other hand, can do none of these things. So the chatter dries up as we ascend a 1-in-21 incline, topped by a delicious hairpin that causes the 640d’s back end to slither like a drunken python. And then it’s over. I’m torn between hoping Collins will offer me another circuit and wanting to stagger from the car to call my wife and child to say how much I love them. As it happens, I’m forced out of the BMW because there’s a team of techies waiting to install a cluster of cameras at exactly the same height as my head, along with a selection of microphones that wouldn’t look out of place in a professional recording studio. 95.5mph The average speed during our flying lap of the circuit, alhough it was, as you will discover, a lot quicker on the straight sections This is part of the media-first experience that the Telegraph, working with Shell V-Power Nitro+ Diesel, has lined up for its readers. By rigging five GoPro Hero cameras in a sphere in front of the head rest, it’s possible for production company Rewind to create a unique online movie that provides a 360-degree view of Collins’s lap. The result is a virtual-reality film, where you can see exactly what I saw as we completed our circuit by moving your computer mouse to rotate the view. This gives a realistic sense of what it’s like to sit beside a racing driver at the height of his powers, and the strategically placed microphones mean there is a soundtrack to match. There is just one thing missing from this multi-sensory experience. Unless you happen to view the film from the passenger seat of a BMW 640d M, you will have to find some other surface to dig your nails into. • Watch the hair-raising, cutting-edge video » Do you want to help look after your engine?
