No discrepancies were found in the X5 between laboratory-test and field-test NOx emissions.\nThe German magazine Auto Bild has published a clarification of their article released yesterday ( September 24 ) concerning the emissions of a BMW X3 stating: \"No evidence of emission manipulation by BMWâ€¦. The values mentioned in the document were only generated in a single, one hour-long road test. Auto BILD has no access to the details of this test trail, which might explain the discrepancies to the test cycle NEDC.\" (NEDC stands for New European Driving Cycle)\nBMW Group is willing to discuss our testing procedures with the relevant authorities and to make our vehicles available for testing at any time.\nThe importance of diesel engines in achieving CO2 targets\nPolicymakers worldwide, and in particular in the European Union, are setting tough standards for CO2 and other emissions. The 2020 targets in Europe can only be fulfilled through extensive use of modern diesel engines and further electrification.\nThe progress achieved so far in CO2 reduction in Europe is largely due to the use of diesel technology. Meeting future requirements will not be feasible without diesel drive trains, since a diesel engine emits roughly 15 to 20 per cent less CO2 on average than a comparable petrol engine.\nAt the BMW Group, we have invested a great deal in recent years in refining and optimizing diesel technology.\nAt BMW, diesel vehicles accounted for 38% of vehicles sold worldwide last year: Europe 80%; Germany 73%; US 6%. This represents approx. 20,000 vehicles in the US in 2014.\nThe Euro 6 emissions standard, which took effect on 1 September 2015 and is binding for all new vehicle registrations, improves both environmental and consumer protection.\nTo bridge the gap between test results and real-life fuel consumption and emissions, the European Union is working on a new test cycle (WLTP) and an emissions test for real driving situations, known as \"real driving emissions\" or RDE. We support the swift introduction of the new regulations to create clarity for consumers and the industry as quickly as possible.\nBMW Group In America\nBMW of North America , LLC has been present in the United States since 1975.
