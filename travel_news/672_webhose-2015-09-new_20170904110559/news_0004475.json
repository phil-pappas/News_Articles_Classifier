But will take a well-presented fly too. \nThere’s some cosmic trout fishing in the Land of the Rising Sun for exotic amago, yamame and iwana. Plus the usual North American and European invaders. \nBut it was ayu angling, which was first perfected by samurai warriors as a training run for the mayhem and bloodshed they’re more famous for, that began the fly-fishing movement called “tenkara”. \nRoughly translated it means “heaven sent” and has become downright trendy on this side of the Pacific in the last few years. \nIncluding my fishing buddy Emmerson who now owns two tenkara rods. \nThese long sticks and stripped down technology (no reel and a braided horse-tail line for the true believers) are a throwback to simpler times. \nIt`s essentially the same outfit Charles Cotton wrote about in the fly-fishing section of Izaak Walton’s 1676 classic – the Compleat Angler. \n“For the length of your rod, you are always to be governed by the breadth of the river,” Cotton advised. \n“For a trout river one of five or six yards is commonly enough,” he added. \n“To fish fine and far-off is the first and principle rule for trout angling.” \nAnd ayu fishing too. \nOf course, there are no ayu in Alberta. \nBut if you substitute its trout-like mouth for a tiny turned up snout and ignore its vegetarian habits, with a little imagination and poetic license the modest bronze/silver fish of Japan could be a reasonable facsimile for a mountain whitefish. \nAlthough many fly fishers don’t, I have a soft spot for rockies. Raised on the Coal Branch southwest of Edson they were the cradle of my fly-fishing genesis. \nEspecially from mid-August to the end of September when they are running in the McLeod River. \nIf the McLeod isn’t the best mountain whitefish river in the province it has to be in the top five. \nAnd the middle section can be surreal. \nBut with a tenkara it becomes downright celestial. \nIt was a long scramble down a steep bank from where we parked the Jeep to the river’s edge. In keeping with the trip’s retro theme, I strung up my 40-year-old Sharpe’s Scottish cane rod while Emmerson had his 14-foot tenkara which telescopes down into compact package short enough to stow in a pack. \nWe crossed the river to get on the fishing side of the first pool – a long glide below a rapids under a mellow-yellow sandstone cliff. \nEmmerson’s swinging a bead-head nymph with his Japanese rod while my method was more orthodox. \nDrifting a Gold-ribbed Hare’s Ear nymph under a strike indicator. \nA couple of split shot crimped above the nymph kept it in the strike zone. \nImmediately we were into fish. Handsome mulled-gold rockies up to 14 inches that fought harder than their reputation. With a few bonus Arctic grayling in the catch. \nLater when the action stalled we drifted down to a corner pool where the blow-outs had thrown up a big jam with a log down the middle. \nGrasshoppers were clacking from the cliff so Emmerson tied on a Fat Albert and ran it along the sweeper. \nWhen it began to drag three big whites came up and pounded it. But missed a hook-up. \nHe handed me the tenkara. \nAfter a couple of blown casts while I got the rhythm of the wispy line, I laid the hopper pattern along the seam by the log. A whitefish came up and smashed it. \nThe 14-incher put a big bow in the gangly Japanese rod and fighting a fish on a static line put me on a steep learning curve. \nBut after a few tense moments my rocky from heaven finally slipped into the net. \nThe way of the gods. \nwww.neilwaughoutdoors.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:47:44.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
