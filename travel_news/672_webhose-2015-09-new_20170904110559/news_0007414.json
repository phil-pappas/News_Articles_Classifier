Sands China has fallen more than 40 per cent in the past 12 months, Wynn Macau has halved, and SJM Holdings , the casino business of Hong Kong tycoon Stanley Ho, is down by almost two-thirds. \nEarlier this year the Macau government began a review of the gaming sector. A key issue is the renewal of the six gaming concessions on the Cotai Strip, where Sands China’s Venetian casino and hotel complex is due to be joined by the $2.7bn Parisian next year. Sands China’s current license runs until 2022. \nThe appointment of Mr Wong, most recently chairman and chief executive of Hong Kong-based Hsin Chong Construction — which has been involved in all of Sands China’s Macau properties, including the Parisian — comes as Macau’s casino sector grapples with tumbling revenue caused by China’s crackdown on corruption, lavish spending, and illicit capital flight. \nThough still profitable , operators have been reeling from a sharp slowdown in income from gambling in the former Portuguese territory, the only place in China where casino betting is legal. Total sector revenue sank 36 per cent in August, according to official figures , the 15th straight month of decline. \nJamie Soo, Daiwa analyst, expects further contraction in the sector in 2016, as the impact of renminbi depreciation, an extended smoking ban at casinos and China’s economic slowdown are added to the industry’s list of challenges.
