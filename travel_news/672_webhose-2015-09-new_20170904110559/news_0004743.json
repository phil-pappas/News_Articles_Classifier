In an unprecedented move, Four Seasons is opening its guest book almost nine months in advance. \n\n\n“We’ve had so many inquiries from all over the world asking when the new Four Seasons will open, so we’ve decided to start taking reservations for next year as of today,” says Nelson Hilton, Senior Director of Marketing. “Even sight unseen and before we’ve revealed any details, the global reputation of Four Seasons in Hawaii has assured travellers that our fifth resort – the first on Oahu – will be nothing short of extraordinary.” \n\n\nTo celebrate the excitement and thank guests for their enthusiasm, the Resort is presenting an Introductory Offer – Fourth Night Free package, with an average rate beginning at USD 447 per night. Travellers may also book any number of nights at rates beginning at USD 595. Several additional package options are also available for booking. Coinciding with the opening of the reservations books, Four Seasons Resort Oahu has also unveiled its new website virtually transporting guests to paradise with all the exciting details about the Resort’s 358 luxurious rooms and suites, five restaurants and lounges, four pools plus white sand beaches, multi-level Spa and Wellness Centre, tennis facilities and watersports, and preferred access to the Ko Olina Golf Club. \n\n\nThe Resort’s oceanfront location on Oahu’s sunset coast is also the perfect location for weddings and romantic getaways, and a sheltered lagoon will offer family fun for all ages. For groups, extensive meeting facilities can accommodate up to 900 participants. \n\nSource:-Four Seasons Resort", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:04:11.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
