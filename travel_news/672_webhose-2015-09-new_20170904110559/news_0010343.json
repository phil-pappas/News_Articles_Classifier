She was escorted out of his courtroom by a deputy, although not in handcuffs, to be turned over to the custody of federal marshals.\nThe judge also told all five of her deputy clerks that they are free to issue licenses to all applicants, and also face fines or jail if they refuse to comply. He gave them a chance to meet with lawyers before returning to his courtroom to reveal their decisions.\nThe lawyer for Davis, whose defense is funded by the Liberty Counsel, a religious freedom group, argued that the deputy clerks can only issue licenses under Davis' authority, but the judge overrulled this objection.\nHundreds of people chanted and screamed, \"Love won! Love won!\" as word of these decisions reached the crowds outside the federal courthouse.\nKim Davis testified about 20 minutes and was very emotional. She described how she became a Christian and said she is unable to believe anything else.\nApril Miller, one of the women trying to obtain a license, also testified. She said she voted for Kim Davis in the election and that this was only about getting her license, not about trying to change Davis' beliefs.\nIn front of the federal courthouse, demonstrators shouted at each other, sang hymns and waved signs, which ranged from the violent — turn to Jesus or burn — to simple statements of support. A small plane flew over the courthouse, carrying a banner that said: \"Stand Firm Kim.\"\nDavis stopped issuing licenses to all couples in June after the U.S. Supreme Court effectively legalized gay marriage. Despite rulings against her, she's turned away couples again and again.\nThe couples who originally sued in the case asked Bunning to punish Davis with fines but not jail time.\nDavis, an Apostolic Christian, said earlier this week she never imagined this day would come.\n\"I have no animosity toward anyone and harbor no ill will. To me this has never been a gay or lesbian issue. It is about marriage and God's word,\" her statement said.\nHer critics mock this moral stand, noting that Davis is on her fourth husband after being divorced three times.\nDavis served as her mother's deputy in the clerk's office for 27 years before she was elected as a Democrat to succeed her mother in November. Davis' own son is on the staff.\nAs an elected official, she can be removed only if the Legislature impeaches her, which is unlikely in a deeply conservative state.\nJudge Bunning is the son of Jim Bunning, the Hall of Fame pitcher for the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies who served two terms as Kentucky's junior U.S. Senator. Former Republican President George W. Bush nominated David Bunning for a lifetime position as a federal judge in 2001 when he was just 35 years old, halfway through his dad's first term in the Senate.\nBut Bunning has been anything but a sure thing for conservative causes. In 2007, he was part of a three-judge panel on a federal appeals court that overturned Michigan's ban on partial-birth abortion. The panel ruled the state's law was too broad and would outlaw other legal forms of abortion.\nIn 2003, Bunning ordered the Boyd County School District to allow the student club Gay-Straight Alliance to meet on campus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:43:17.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
