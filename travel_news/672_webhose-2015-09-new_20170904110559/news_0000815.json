They had not searched the area, located downstream from Keyhole Canyon, earlier because of the threat of more flash floods, he said.\nThe people in the group were between 40 and 50 years old and from California and Nevada, park spokeswoman Alyssa Baltrus said.\nThe park service has not identified any of the victims but the sheriff’s department in Ventura County, California, said in a statement that one of the people killed was Steve Arthur, a sergeant and 21-year veteran with the department.\nHis wife, Linda Arthur, was the last person missing, the sheriff’s department said.\nThe park service regularly warns people about the possibility of flash floods, according to the Facebook page of the park.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:07:13.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
