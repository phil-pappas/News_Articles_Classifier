As there is no need to certify aircraft that will not fly on long routes over water, American Airlines has two types of A321s – the A321H, which can fly to Hawaii, and the A321S, which cannot.\nIn August the airline flew an A321S on Flight 31 from LA to Honolulu, spokesman Casey Norton confirmed.\nAs both versions of the A321 are fundamentally the same aircraft and each has emergency life rafts and vests required for a water evacuation, the error was not necessarily dangerous but was a major violation of Federal Aviation Administration regulations.\nAn member of airline staff discovered the mistake while the aircraft was mid-flight. American Airlines decided to continue on to Honolulu, Norton told briansummers.com.\nThe return flight was cancelled and the aircraft was flown back to LA empty.\nRead more: Stunning demise of United Airlines' Jeffery Smisek – just deserts or sacrificial lamb? \nWhat's it like on board North Korean airline Air Koryo - the worst in the world? \nThe Americas gain yet more airline routes “When we noticed it, we immediately undertook an internal investigation, and we alerted the FAA,” Norton said.\n“We are checking our internal procedures, everything that led up to the departure. We are going to figure out what we can do better.”\nHe added that the airline had made some “changes to software systems” following the incident. \nAmerican Airlines began flying the Airbus A321 to Hawaii just days before the mix up.\nSpeaking to the Washington Post Summers said the mistake was “really rare”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T13:01:59.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
