The technology will be deployed across Sussex and possibly further afield if the trial is successful.\nDriver on their mobile phone (library pic) Credit: PA An Institute of Advanced Motorists survey questioned 500 people:\n18% claimed to have accessed the internet while driving (27% of those aged 18-24 years, and 34% aged 25-34 years) 8% of those questioned admitted to driving while using a video application such as FaceTime and Skype to make and receive video calls, rising to 16% among those age 18-24 years. 7% admitted to watching videos and ‘catch-up television’ while driving - rising to 13% of those aged 18-24 years and 15% of 25-32 year olds. 9% of all respondents admitted to taking a ‘selfie’ while driving in the last month.
