If you want to get a bite, no problem. Wolfgang Puck has been hired to cater. If you want craft beers and liquor after the show, the Fillmore has you covered. Bension, who oversees 57 House of Blues venues, understands what the consumer wants. \n\"What we want to do at the Fillmore is not just have a building for a concert-only experience,\" Bension says. \"It was about that in this business a few years ago, but that's changed. It's about having a full entertainment experience now. We provided great spaces for people to hang out at the Fillmore. We will give people the opportunity to hang out before the show, have drinks and dinner, catch the show and if they want to, hang out after the show. We are going to give you the opportunity to make it a night. There will be a full kitchen and after-parties.\" \nThe Fillmore name honors the iconic theater opened in San Francisco in 1965. It was the focal point of the psychedelic music scene during the 1960s and '70s, helping to launch the careers of The Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Santana, The Doors, The Allman Brothers Band and more. \nThe Philly Fillmore marks the seventh venue in the United States to bear the Fillmore name \nIt boasts great sight lines, movable curtains and an enviable sound system installed by the renowned Clair Brothers. \n\"We're going all out because we're trying to create something that is second to none, not just in the Philadelphia market but in the world,\" Bension says. \nThe Fillmore lineup certainly is eclectic. English folk-singer Frank Turner will perform Oct. 2. Brandi Carlisle, who stole South By Southwest in March, is on her \"Pindrop\" tour, which is slated for Oct. 11. Classic rocker Joe Walsh hits the stage Oct. 12. DJ Griz will appear Oct. 21. Indie rock band Aer plays Oct. 24. Pop-punk act Cold War Kids will be in action Oct. 28. Jam band Moe performs Halloween night. Guitar hero Gary Clark Jr. is set for Nov. 1. Electronic rock band Awolnation is scheduled Nov. 10. \n\"We're genre-agnostic,\" Bension says \"We look at every recording artist. If they are right for the venue, then that's great.\" \nThe plan is for the venue, which also will open a comedy club and bowling alley within a few months, to be open 300 nights a year. How will the venue, which is in an urban neighborhood, handle the traffic? It doesn't have its own garage or lot but there are multiple lots in the area. \n\"There's tons of parking,\" Bension says. \"And there's lots of public transit. We're across from a casino [Sugar House]. The metro [the El] runs close by and there is a cable car [the 15 trolley]. It will work. I'll tell you why. Look at where Fenway Park and Wrigley Field are located. Each ballpark is in an old urban neighborhood. People figured out how to make it work there and they will figure it out with the Fillmore in Philadelphia. We're going to offer something customers will want to experience. They'll get great recording artists, an outstanding environment with an amazing bar and top-quality dishes. It'll be an experience.\" \nInside, the venue retains the industrial feel of the Ajax factory and smacks of urban Philadelphia. A smokestack rises through the building and it continues up through the roof; it's visible from I-95. There is a lot of exposed brick with original graffiti. The floor in the main hall is hardwood. There is a Betsy Ross flag mural comprised of posters from recent Fillmore shows. There is a replication of the Love Statue but they pulled the O for an I. Artists are painting murals on the walls. \nThose who have tickets for the Fillmore opener will receive a poster by Bucks County artist Bonnie MacLean, who created the broadsides for the original Fillmore in San Francisco 1967-1971. Back then, MacLean was married to the Fillmore's legendary concert promoter Bill Graham. \nAfter breaking up with Graham in 1971, MacLean moved back to Bucks County and focused on still lifes and nude portraits. \n\"It's fun to be back in the poster business again,\" MacLean says. \nMacLean made 32 posters and saw some of the greatest rock bands in history perform at the San Francisco Fillmore, which has a capacity of 1,150. \n\"I saw so many groups there,\" MacLean says. \"I remember seeing the Yardbirds, the Doors, but my favorite was Cream, which had three great musicians ... I remember seeing Andy Warhol just wandering around hugging the wall. He was so shy. But I didn't really interact much with the musicians, that's what Bill did.\" \nMacLean, 75, will be on hand at the Hall & Oates show with her son David. \"It's going to be quite an event.\" \nEd Condran is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T02:50:48.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
