Launched this past April as Starwood’s 10th brand, Tribute Portfolio is a collection of outstanding independent hotels and resorts, promising owners, Starwood Preferred Guest® (SPG®) members and guests alike the ability to “Stay Independent.” The signing of the Great Northern Hotel – a historic King’s Cross London landmark – is a significant step in the global roll-out of Tribute Portfolio and reflects the growing global trend for independent, yet dependable high-end travel experiences.\n“We are delighted to welcome the Great Northern Hotel as the first Tribute Portfolio property in Europe,” said Dave Marr, Global Brand Leader for Tribute Portfolio and Sheraton Hotels & Resorts. “The hotel has been designed with such meticulous attention to detail, and we’re excited to partner alongside Mr. Jeremy Robson as he continues to bring his independent vision to life.”\nTribute Portfolio Lands in London\nSituated within the new Western Concourse of King’s Cross and just 25 meters from the Eurostar terminus at St. Pancras International, the Great Northern is one of the finest upscale boutique hotels in greater London. Having first opened in 1854, the hotel has been exquisitely refurbished and re-designed by Victorian master builder Lewis Cubitt to evoke the glamour and grace of the building’s extraordinary past. The Cubitt rooms feature high ceilings and large twin sash windows, filling the rooms with an abundance of natural light, while the fun and charming Couchette rooms serve as innovative interpretations of a traditional railway carriage car sleeper. The Wainscot rooms, located on the top floor of the hotel, have high mansard style ceilings and are lined with Black American Walnut Wainscot paneling, which, along with deep aubergine paint, create a seductive ambiance.\nGuests of the Great Northern can enjoy a variety of dining options that bring to life the ambiance and flavors of English cuisine. Plum + Spilt Milk, located one flight up the hotel’s original grand staircase, offers simple British dishes using seasonal and carefully-sourced ingredients. The restaurant, whose name originates from the lively colors of the dining cars pulled by the Flying Scotsman, features 120 hand blown glass pendants and banquette-based furniture, handmade by Boffi of Milan. Designed with the aim of being one of Europe’s most glamorous railway bars, The GNH Bar opens directly into King’s Cross station and features etched mirror ceilings, an organically-shaped pewter and marble bar and two grand crystal chandeliers.\nSource:-Starwood Hotels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T15:38:29.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
