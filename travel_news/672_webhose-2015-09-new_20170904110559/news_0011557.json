Bill Savage of Munising titles the photo “Honor. Heritage.” (Photo: Bill Savage) \nBill Savage of Munising jumped at the chance to attend a Sault Tribe of Chippewa Indians powwow in August.\n“I am fascinated by the Native American culture,” he said. “One of the many things this powwow embraces is audience participation. At specific times, spectators are welcomed into their ‘arena’ and invited to walk, dance or otherwise enjoy the celebration right alongside these fine, proud, Sault tribe native Americans.”\nSavage’s photo of the powwow’s lead male dancer in full regalia earns one of the last spots in the finals of The Detroit News’ ninth annual Celebrate Michigan Photo Contest , the summerlong event inviting amateur photographers to shoot anything wonderful about our state.\nThis powwow was held in Christmas, Michigan, on the shore of Lake Superior.\n“It is a spectacle that no one should miss,” Savage said. “I spent the entire day there, leaving with a greater understanding and respect for these people, their history and their culture.”\nOther photo finalists selected this week:\n■ “Peaceful Turmoil” by Laura Fluke of Chesterfield. The lake report warned of a strong north wind, causing dangerous rip currents. Fluke arrived at Benton Harbor’s beach just before sunset, in time to catch the crashing waves, lighthouse, setting sun and passing seagull in one terrific shot.\n■ “Icy Passage” by Christopher List of Romulus. The freighter Cuyahoga passes in the background behind huge chunks of ice on the shore of Belle Isle in late December. List had reluctantly taken a detour to Belle Isle at a friend’s urging, and was glad he did.\n■ “Starlight House” by Joshua Kallio of Berkley. His digitally enhanced nighttime shot shows the Tawas Point Lighthouse shining its beams into Lake Huron. “There are places in Michigan that seem unreal,” he said.\n■ “Basking in the Sunrise” by Cathy Rudd of Roseville. Every morning Rudd takes Opie, her 12-year-old mixed terrier rescue, for a walk. “This morning I caught her profile just as the sun was making its way up through the clouds,” Rudd said.\nThe contest prizes are:\n■ First place: A two-night stay for four at Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island.\n■ Second place: $300.\n■ Third place: A gift basket of made-in-Michigan products.\n■ Best digitally enhanced image: A 16-by-20-inch matted and framed print of your photo.\nThe contest is now closed. We extend our thanks to everyone who took the time to upload their photos. At detroitnews.com/celebratemichigan you can see all 2,020 of this year’s entries and browse the photo gallery of the finalists .\nAll that remains is the toughest task: choosing four prize winners.
