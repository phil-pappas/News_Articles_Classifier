The cost to enter: $150 and one well-written essay.\nFor the contest to work, Steffey must receive 4,500 entries by mid-October, which would raise more than $600,000.\nA winner will be chosen in November. And by mid-December, you could be taking possession of the 5,000-square-foot inn, just outside Millersburg.\nSteffey got the idea after hearing about a Maine innkeeper who held a similar contest earlier this year, which drew more than 7,000 participants.\nKris Ullmer, executive director of the Professional Association of Innkeepers International, said the approach is unusual but not unheard of.\n\"It's a different tactic and a way to generate interest in a different way,\" said Ullmer, a former innkeeper in Wisconsin. \"The fact that the innkeeper is inviting prospective innkeepers to pour their hearts out about their vision for the B&B shows the passion that innkeepers have for the business of hospitality and the desire to continue the tradition.\"\nSteffey, who bought Garden Gate in 2002, has tried to sell it for a couple of years, but with no serious interest. It was recently valued by a broker at $725,000; if she attracts 4,500 entries, she'll make about $675,000.\nThe idea behind the essay contest, though, is about more than money.\nSteffey, 53, said she has had countless conversations with guests who said they would love to own an inn, but could never afford to buy one.\n\"Here's a way for the average person to have a chance to follow their dream,\" she said.\nSteffey and her husband, Herb, bought the property after she left a pressure-cooker job as an accountant in Detroit. She sought a more flexible work schedule and more time with their son, both of which she got.\nShe also made some lifelong friends. \"We have our regulars who come back again and again,\" she said. \"Some of them are quite upset we're going to leave.\"\nBut owning an inn is hard work, she said, which includes cooking, cleaning, entertaining guests, marketing, accounting and more. \"I left one seven-day-a-week, 80-hour job to take another seven-day-a-week, 80-hour job,\" she said.\nShe and her husband are planning to move to Florida after the house sells.\nInitially owned by an Amish family, the house was built in 1979 and has been expanded twice, and includes material from an old one-room schoolhouse.\nIt has five rooms to rent on the first floor, each with its own bathroom, plus two nearby \"honeymoon\" cottages. The second floor, which the Steffeys use as their private living space, has four bedrooms, a living room, kitchen and two bathrooms.\nThe turnkey sale includes furniture, linens, kitchen supplies and other business equipment.\nThe inn, located on about an acre of land in one of Ohio's top tourist destinations, comes with some terrific views.\n\"Amish neighbors surround the bed and breakfast, which is a feature that guests absolutely love,\" said Steffey. \"They see horses grazing in the field next door, horse and buggy traveling down the road, and sometimes they even see a wedding in the neighborhood.\"\nEntries are due by Oct. 15. Steffey and her husband will cull the entries to 20; two judges from outside the area will pick a winner.\nMoney, in the form of a cashier's check or money order, will be returned to entrants if the contest doesn't garner enough interest.\nFor full contest details and more information about the property: garden-gate.com/news .", "external_links": ["http://www.garden-gate.com/", "http://www.garden-gate.com/news/"], "published": "2015-09-08T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:26:57.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
