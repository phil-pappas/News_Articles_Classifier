(Photo: iStock) \nDid you have an amazing Labor Day weekend? Feeling a little low at the realization that summer is pretty much over? Welcome to the club. \nWhat you’re feeling is the post-vacation blues, and thanks to a new survey from the travel search site momondo , we know that it’s an epidemic that is likely affecting millions of Americans who spent the last long weekend boating, barbecuing, relaxing, and drinking. \nAccording to the survey, 58 percent of respondents find it difficult to return to work/studies after a long break of a week or more. Taking it a step further, 39 percent reveal that they actually feel depressed when they return home. \nBummer. \nSo the real question is, “How should you cope with the post-vacation blues?” While there is no one cure-all, the survey does identify some ways that travelers deal with the transition back to real life. \nRelated: How to Stay on Vacation Forever — These People Did It! \n“There’s the 25% who say that to cope with ‘back-to-the-real-world’ blues, they start planning their next vacation,” says Lasse Skole Hansen, spokesperson for momondo. “Our data shows that tickets are cheapest when purchased at least 53 days before departure, so many Americans are already looking to book their next vacation.” \nThrow a BBQ and surround yourself with friends. It might just remind you why you love being home.

Maybe planning a little get-together at your place will be just what you need to settle back into your routine. \n15 percent said they cope with coming home by sleeping longer, and on the other end of the spectrum, 14 percent say that getting more exercise helps them get back into the swing of things. \nHere at Yahoo Travel, we think going on a staycation in your own city is a great way to deal with post-vacation blues. Traveling is thrilling and exciting because you’re experiencing something, so why not plan an adventure in your own city? \nTry a new restaurant, visit a museum you haven’t been to in a while, spend the afternoon reading in a new park, or check out a random show at a local music venue. \nGive yourself reasons to appreciate being home, and you may just find that your post-vacation blues start to disappear. \nWATCH: 5 Steps to the Perfect Puerto Rican Getaway \nYahoo Travel inspire you every day.
