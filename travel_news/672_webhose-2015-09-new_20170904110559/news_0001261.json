In a vision of life imitating art imitating life, as the piano played and continued its journey a beautiful ballerina performed on its lid, dancing to the music. The enchanting performance leaving a romantic memory in the hearts of the audience. Just like a real live, beautiful musical box.This edition of the unique festival was organized by the municipality of Longiano and the Italian Association of Mechanical Music, and supported by the Senate of the Republic, the Emilia-Romagna Region, EXPO Emilia-Romagna and Italia Pavillion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:29:21.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
