The results sent the shares up almost 8pc, to 988p. Ashtead’s stock had drifted 15pc lower this year, prior to yesterday’s jump, on wider fears that the US economic recovery is stalling and disappointing numbers from its biggest rival, United Rentals. Ashtead reported no such slowdown, with group revenue up 20pc in the three months to July 31. The group operates as Sunbelt in the US, which accounts for 96pc of total operating profit, and A-Plant in the UK. The company said both businesses performed well in the first quarter, with rental revenue growth of 10pc at A-Plant. Ashtead chief executive Geoff Drabble is driving what one analysts called 'relentless' growth Photo: Martin Pope The equipment hire group spent £291m on new kit during the first quarter, net of disposals, increasing the total rental fleet to £3.8bn, up from £2.8bn a year ago. The company expects to spend a total of £1bn on such items during the full-year. After bad weather delayed the spring construction season, Ashtead is experiencing an acceleration in demand. The company has been taking advantage of the buoyant US trading to use debt to grow. Net debt increased to £1.8bn at the end of July, up from £1.3bn at the same stage last year. Putting that into perspective, net assets on the balance sheet were £1.2bn. Investors need to be careful about chasing the growth at Ashtead, as using the cash and borrowing for rapid growth works both ways. The shares have retreated from record highs of £12.30 in May. Ashtead now trades on 12 times the forecast 77.9p in earnings per share, or £609m in full-year pre-tax profits. It is an encouraging start, but the recommendation remains a hold after an extremely strong run in Ashtead shares. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:11:33.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
