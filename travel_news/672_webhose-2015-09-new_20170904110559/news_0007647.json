These new city launches bring the total number of cities on the platform to 18 within the United States , with plans to continue expanding in 2015.\n\" Boston and Philadelphia are two of the most historic and frequently visited cities in America, but there's so much about these cities that gets missed by travel guidebooks and review sites,\" said Localeur co-founder and CEO Joah Spearman . \"Launching Localeur in these cities turns over a new leaf in local discovery to help travelers have more authentic experiences while also helping local businesses that can't compete with the chains listed on most review sites.\"\nBeginning today, users can visit Localeur.com or download Localeur's native iOS or Android apps and access recommendations for both Boston and Philadelphia â€“ ranging from \"How to Spend a Day in Boston's Fenway Neighborhood\" to \" Philadelphia's Buzzworthy Coffee Shops.\" The community of locals on Localeur will continue to add recommendations for each of these cities to span multiple categories and neighborhoods in the metro areas.\nLocaleur, which initially launched in Austin at SXSW 2013, was named the year's best new startup by Austin Monthly later that year, and more recently has been named one of the top travel apps of 2015 by The Today Show , Forbes, TIME, The New York Times , Men's Journal , MTV, and others.\nLocaleur has now built a community of Millennial locals ranging from DJs and photographers to food bloggers and musicians in 18 major U.S. cities (listed in order of launch): Austin , Houston , San Francisco , New York City , Los Angeles , Dallas , Atlanta , Chicago , Denver , Miami , Seattle, Washington D.C., New Orleans , and Portland, Ore.
