Together they will explore opportunities to support, sustain and upgrade defense systems; integrate unique Polish systems on Boeing platforms; strengthen manufacturing capabilities; incorporate PGZ companies in Boeing’s supply chain; pursue joint research and development and advance defense industrial capabilities.\n“PGZ member companies are diverse and have the potential to play an even larger role in the international aerospace and defense industry. The collaboration opportunities available through Boeing’s expansive military, commercial, security and space portfolios can turn potential into reality for PGZ,” said Jeff Kohler, Boeing’s vice president for International Business Development for Defense, Space & Security.\n“Since its establishment, PGZ’s priority has been to make its business activity as international as possible. We find it particularly important to conclude such agreements with foreign partners that, on one hand, are going to support the execution of the Technical Modernization Plan of the Polish Armed Forces and, on the other hand, are going to incorporate PGZ companies in international supply chains,” said Wojciech Dąbrowski, President of the Management Board of PGZ. “I am convinced that cooperation between PGZ and Boeing will be fruitful for both parties. This is an opportunity for PGZ companies to achieve innovation growth and enter new business areas.”\nOne of the first Boeing platforms offering potential for Polish industry collaboration is the AH-64E Apache, which is a candidate for Poland’s attack helicopter requirement as part of the country’s defense modernization program. Boeing and its AH-64E Apache industry team – which includes General Electric, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Longbow Ltd. – recently participated in a two-day workshop with 10 PGZ companies to forge partnerships as part of Poland’s Kruk Program. Boeing and its industry partners will continue to work with PGZ companies to identify opportunities across other military and commercial platforms and systems.\nPGZ is the leader of the Polish industry and one of the largest defence groups in Europe. It concentrates more than 30 companies (of defence, shipyard, new technologies sectors), achieving annual revenue of circa PLN 5 billion. By making use of the technology Polonisation potential, close cooperation with the Polish scientists and focus on the research and development process, PGZ offers innovative products which enhance Poland’s security. Furthermore, it upgrades, modernizes and maintains vehicles, airplanes, helicopters, and vessels. In the coming years, PGZ will develop aerospace and satellite technologies as well as cyber technologies as it looks to triple its business by 2030.\nSource:-Boeing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:17:28.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
