The event coincided with a pre-season game against the Minnesota Vikings . \nThe Raider Nation was out in force in Baja Oakland, a.k.a. Oakland South or San Diego, on Saturday 22 August. 2015. \nAccording Mike Sommers, Founder of the Raiders Fan Convention and Organizer of the 3rd annual Raiders Fan Convention South , about 350 people attended the event, which was held at the Handlery Hotel at San Diego's world famous Hotel Circle. \n\"The hotel was beautiful, and they set up a bar just for us,\" Mike says. \nJournalists from Fox 5 San Diego were in attendance to cover the proceedings and broadcast it on the news. Not sure how the city's Charger fans felt about that! \n\"We had a great time without a hitch,\" Mike says. \"Vendors were busy, and many people signed up for marrow donor matching.\" \nAnd talk about entertainment! \nThe DJ mardeeMar, rapper JCino, and Pure Breed (rappers) came out of retirement to perform. \n\"The band Pure Majik played and were awesome and had people dancing,\" Mike says. \n\"The kids raffle for a Raiders blanket is always special and the raffle for a 40\" TV was great.\" \nTed Hendricks Sign in front of the Handlery Hotel in San Diego advertising the appearance of Ted Hendricks.

He signed a lot of autographs - something Ted rarely does anyone, but he was very kind to everyone. \n\"Ted was super friendly and gracious and came on stage and told us inside stories of him wearing the mask we have seen him in (he was upset he wasn't in the lineup that day), stories of [Former Oakland Raider Coach] John Madden and his fear of flying, kicking a bucket in the locker room and spraining his ankle, and Al Davis with his personal conversations with the players,\" Mike says. \nNot surprising at a Raider Nation event, there were lots of Photo Opps! \n\"Violator Pharaoh Raider, Mystic Raider, and Maska Raider came out taking photos with all the fans,\" Mike says. \n\"I went to every person at the event and asked if they were having fun, and they all [said they] loved it. Many there for the first time and plan on returning next year with their friends. We also had many of the local San Diego raider booster clubs in attendance and many other booster clubs came out in groups \nAnd in case you missed Raiders Fan Convention South, not to worry! Raiders Fan Convention Oakland is scheduled for 14 and 15 November 2015. \nAnd by sheer coincidence, the Raiders will be playing the same team, the Minnesota Vikings, but this time at home at Oaktown's notorious Black Hole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T22:30:51.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
