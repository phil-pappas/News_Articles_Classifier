Financial terms were not disclosed.\nVianova Systems is a pioneer in the development of software leveraging advanced BIM technology for the civil engineering market and infrastructure lifecycle management across road, rail, sea and air infrastructure design. The company offers a portfolio of solutions for civil engineers, civil contractors and project owners. These solutions include specialist tools for road, rail, utility, site, bridge and tunnel civil design, advanced geotechnical analysis and sophisticated model-based multiuser collaboration tools. In addition, the tools include civil design project tracking, design model traceability and automated design change monitoring. Vianova Systems has a strong record of delivering infrastructure management solutions for national road and rail authorities, with the goal of bridging the gaps between design, construction and maintenance.\nTrimble is focused on leveraging the Constructible Model to maximize efficiencies across the Design-Construct-Maintain project lifecycle with the goal of achieving a leaner asset ownership lifecycle. The Constructible Model enables stakeholders to visualize, sequence, clash-detect, collaborate and optimize processes-significantly reducing the number of design errors and conflicts while also increasing the accuracy and quality of the work performed.\nThe acquisition of Vianova Systems will extend Trimble's Connected Site ® portfolio. Trimble's Connected Site is an extensive information management solution that provides a high-level of process and workflow integration to optimize operations from the design phase through to the finished project-delivering significant improvements in planning, real-time project management and productivity throughout the construction lifecycle.\n\"The combination of Vianova Systems' Building Information Modeling capabilities and Trimble's ability to drive constructability into workflows will optimize both site and project processes. With Vianova Systems, we can now deliver solutions for the owner, engineer and contractor to more closely collaborate on civil projects,\" said Roz Buick , vice president of Trimble's Civil Engineering and Construction Division. \"The resulting set of solutions will enable significant efficiencies, driving greater transformation in the industry.\"\n\"Vianova Systems has a vision of full digitization and collaboration using holistic Building Information Modeling across the design, construction and maintenance phase of public and private infrastructure,\" said Idar Kirkhorn , CEO for Vianova Systems. \"The addition of our solutions to Trimble's leading portfolio of construction positioning and workflow automation solutions extends our collective ability to deliver the Constructible Model as early in the lifecycle as possible. Our existing customers will benefit from the combination as we continue to develop, sell and support our Novapoint and Quadri products.\"\nThe acquisition of Vianova Systems includes the company's wholly-owned operations in Norway , Sweden and Denmark , plus partly owned subsidiaries in Benelux and France . Other associated Vianova companies in Norway and internationally are not included in the acquisition.\nAbout Vianova Systems\nVianova Systems AS is an international pioneer and a market leader in Scandinavia within civil engineering software for designing transport infrastructure. By collaborating closely with key public and private industry organizations, the company develops technology-leading solutions that provide world-class results for the individual user, customer, partner and society. Founded on a model-based, multi-discipline software vision, Vianova Systems pioneered infrastructure design tools with its Novapoint design applications for road, rail, sea and air infrastructure design. With this philosophy, the company has also developed its BIM for infrastructure solution Novapoint DCM and Quadri DCM that provide tangible lifecycle benefits for infrastructure projects. More than 15,000 engineers use Novapoint to design modern transport infrastructure, supported by Vianova Systems' dedicated experts-with prime markets in Scandinavia and Northern Europe .\nFor more information, visit: www.vianovasystems.com .\nAbout Trimble's Civil Engineering and Construction Division\nTrimble is a leading innovator of productivity solutions for the civil engineering and construction sectors.
