But for me, the final moments I spent with my intended on the eve of our wedding are also etched oh-so clearly on my memory. Is that because of some sweet and impossibly romantic gesture on his part? Or a tender moment we shared, which has our three children swooning when I regale the story? I’m afraid not. In actual fact, Carl and I had a blazing row – goodness knows what it was about this time – that meant the only passion that was stirred, in me at least, was absolute fury. I then stormed off to my mother’s in my clapped out Mini Metro, with my fiancé in hot pursuit This bust-up (if only I could remember the details, but it was 23 years ago this summer) ended with me, in a fit of pique, calling him something unmentionably rude and unpublishable before announcing that he’d better not count on seeing me at church the next day. My spleen fully vented, I then stormed off to my mother’s in my clapped out Mini Metro… with my fiancé in hot pursuit. Carl caught up with me at a set of traffic lights, where he beeped his horn and signalled for me to pull over. Of course, I ignored him. At the second set of lights, he was able to pull up alongside me, where he wound down his window and bellowed through it that I was a “pain in the backside” but would I please pull over at the next layby. At the side of a busy dual carriageway, leaning against the first car I owned, Carl held me The site of my husband-to-be, clearly frantic that I might actually have meant it all and that he was facing a jilting at the altar had the desired effect – my heart softened just enough to do as he pleaded. By the time I drove into that layby I actually felt sorry that once again my hot temper and his uncanny knack of winding me up had spoilt our final moments together before we became a married couple. Only it hadn’t. Because at the side of a busy dual carriageway, leaning against the first car I owned, Carl held me in his arms and we kissed and made up. I might have appeared slightly sulky at first, but in my heart that’s when I truly knew this was the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. And so, of course, I did turn up at church the following day where the next words we spoke to each other were “I do”. And funnily enough, that’s a story our kids love as much as we do. • Happy driving experiences lead to happy marriages.
