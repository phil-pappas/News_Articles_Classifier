The office is scheduled to be phased out through the end of 2015 in what's described as a \"complicated process.\"\nState tourism director Claudia Vecchio described the move as a restructuring, and said new tourism efforts in China expected to launch next summer would be less government-centric and reflect an evolving Chinese tourism landscape.\nNevada was the first state granted a license to open an official tourism promotion office in Beijing. Vecchio said Chinese and Nevadan officials had differences of opinion and Nevada officials determined it would be best to close the office.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:28:05.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
