Huang met Acting Foreign Minister Hamzah Zainuddin on Monday. \nAccording to The Star Huang on Friday also said Beijing would not be afraid to speak out against incidents that could derail Malaysia-China relations. \nSer Choon Ing secretary general of the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall a coalition of Chinese community groups welcomed the ambassador's visit and his remarks. \n\"I don't think it can be considered interference. What the ambassador did was probably a good thing for the Chinese and also for Indians who feel discriminated against\" he said. \nChina's foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei on Monday defended the ambassador's actions as \"normal\". \nHe said: \"We refrain from interfering into other countries' internal affairs. \n\"What our ambassador did was normal he was visiting the Chinese community during the Mid-Autumn festival. We hope that Malaysia can remain united and stable and that people from different ethnic groups can live together in peace.\" \nSpeaking at a business conference on Monday in Kuala Lumpur Huang stressed China and Malaysia enjoyed good relations. \n\"China and Malaysia have a long history of friendship. Malaysia was the earliest ASEAN country to have diplomatic ties with China and after 41 years both countries have close relations in politics economy culture military tourism and other fields\" he said. \nMany Kuala Lumpur businesses run by Chinese -- who make up about a quarter of Malaysia's population -- were shut for the September 16 rally which saw riot police fire water cannon on ethnic Malay protesters. \nAt least several thousand demonstrators marched through the heart of the capital to declare support for Prime Minister Najib Razak a Malay who is facing calls to step down over a financial scandal. \nThe demonstration was one of the clearest public displays yet of what many Malaysian moderates warn is a worrying trend toward racial and religious intolerance among Malays. \nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T22:54:25.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
