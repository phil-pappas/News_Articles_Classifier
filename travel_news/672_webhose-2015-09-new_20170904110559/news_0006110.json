As part of this new partnership, the Hilton Golfer of the Month initiative will be launched from September 2015onwards to recognize outstanding efforts of Asian Tour members, who continue to sparkle both at home and abroad.

Hilton Worldwide will also enjoy the opportunity to leverage the Asian Tour's global television platform which has a potential reach of 625 million homes in 180 countries. The global hospitality company will also have a presence across the Asian Tour's digital media outlets and opportunities to work closely with tournament organizers throughout the season to provide the best hospitality and service to all at the Asian Tour as they travel the region and beyond. \"With the Asian Tour traversing the length and breadth of the Asian region annually, our new association with Hilton Worldwide, who currently operates over 130 hotels across Asia Pacific, is truly a wonderful milestone for us,\" said Asian Tour, CEO, Mike Kerr. \"Hilton is an iconic brand that is synonymous with hospitality and known to provide enriched experiences for its guests.
