From recycling asphalt and concrete to innovative inventions like self-healing concrete, Adam and his talented team are always on the lookout for the latest environmentally friendly trends .\n\"This is why we are so excited about the possibility of roads that actually recharge electric cars as they drive,\" Adam said, adding that these specially designed roadways will reduce pollution, increase the performance and range of electric cars to unheard-of levels, and reduce or entirely eliminate the need for charging stations.\nAs the article explains, the UK government is currently moving forward with a trial of experimental charging roads. Just as a wireless phone charger will power up a smartphone, the roads will charge vehicles using magnetic induction resonance.\n\"Cables implanted in the material of the roadway generate a specialized electromagnetic field that the car can convert into usable energy,\" the article notes.\nAdam said Calvac Paving will continue to watch the news out of the UK with interest, and are hopeful that the technology is feasible. As he noted, if everything works out as the researchers and mathematical equations suggest, these roads will have a major impact on both freeway and automotive design, as well as the entire transportation market.\n\"We think that's a pretty big win, and look forward to this technology here at home,\" Adam said.\nAbout Calvac Paving:\nCalvac Paving is a full service asphalt and concrete maintenance company that has been serving the greater Bay Area since 1974.
