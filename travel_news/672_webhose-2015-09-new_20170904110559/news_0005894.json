Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 02, 2015 eTN   \nIt was Kenya Airways which broke the news that in a last minute change of heart the Kenya’s Department of Immigration installed separate desks at the main airport of Nairobi to facilitate visitors coming to the country who failed to secure an e-Visa in time of else failed to apply for one online in the first place. \nIt could not be ascertained if the facility also exists in Mombasa to where most of the charter flights from Europe come. \nGiven that strong sentiments remain, some expressed by potential visitors here who were and continue to struggle with the e-Visa system, this is good news for the country as last minute deciders can now continue to select Kenya as a destination when for instance scanning the last minute offers in airports in Germany and the UK among other places. \nMany tourism stakeholders have and continue to advocate for a parallel system of Visa to be also available on arrival to make travel to Kenya easier and not put unnecessary hurdles in the way of people who would want to come for a safari or beach vacation but are put off by red tape and bureaucracy – pun intended. \nThe situation will be monitored in coming days to ascertain how well the system works, including the e-Visa on arrival. At least two airline sources have also confirmed that they will, for now, not refuse visitors to Kenya without an e-Visa now that the added option is available while of course travelers continue to have the option to fly into Kigali or Entebbe, secure an East African common tourist Visa on arrival at the cost of 100 US Dollars and then travel across the region without the hassle of online Visa applications standing in their way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T09:13:40.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
