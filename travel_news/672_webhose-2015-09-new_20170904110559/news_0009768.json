Launched in 2009 as a pan-Asia initiative, the ASEAN-Korea Center has carried out various programs including a trade fair, workshops and small and medium enterprise support programs in the 10 member countries to promote cultural, social and economic exchanges between Korea and ASEAN.Valere TjolleValere Tjolle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:29:17.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
