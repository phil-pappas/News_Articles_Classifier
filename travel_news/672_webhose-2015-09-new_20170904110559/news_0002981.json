A patchwork quilt for your bedspread—or wall—is not exactly de rigueur for today’s design set. However, the moment has come to take a second look at the OG of decor. Out this month and focusing on one iconic iteration of the craft is Red & White Quilts: Infinite Variety by Elizabeth V. Warren with Maggi Gordon . The tome, something of a belated catalog to the sensational 2011 Park Avenue Armory exhibition of the same name, showcases the 650-plus-piece collection of Joanna S. Rose (whose husband funded the show as an 80th birthday present for his wife). Organized by type, from traditional patchworks and log cabin varieties to decorative appliqué examples, this perfect coffee-table topper spans three centuries and includes a foreword by Martha Stewart . Feeling inspired? In honor of the publication, here are our favorite red and white quilts for home.
