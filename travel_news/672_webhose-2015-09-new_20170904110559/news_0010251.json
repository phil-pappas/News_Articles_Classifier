Scroll through her Instagram feed and you’ll soon see that Baddie Winkle really is the baddest granny around. Just last month Baddie was seen hanging out with Miley Cyrus backstage at this year’s MTV Video Music Awards , and she's rumoured to be friends with Nicole Richie. With a penchant for tie-dye, slogan t-shirts and raver clothes, the octogenarian has become an overnight style icon and she couldn’t be happier about it. Famed for her rule-breaking, rebellious style, Baddie is scheduled to appear at New York Fashion Week next week. Life hasn’t always been kind to Baddie Winkle, however. @nicolerichie taught me some amazing things about crystals! Watch more of her on #CandidlyNicole which premieres on 7/29 at 11/10c on @vh1 #ad A photo posted by @baddiewinkle on Jul 16, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT Born in 1928 during the Great Depression , Helen Van Winkle lost her husband Earl in a car accident on their 35th wedding anniversary. In 1999, Helen's son David died at the age of 46 after a short battle with cancer; a loss that Helen still struggles to comprehend. “I fought for years trying to get over the deaths of my son and my husband,” Helen admits. “I led a very sad life but I had to go on and be strong for my daughter, my 5 grandchildren and my 3 great-grandchildren.” In a recent documentary by Refinery29 , Helen spoke of her grief: “I cried all the time because I couldn’t come to terms with it. So I made myself over into Baddie Winkle. This new chapter in my life, I’m looking forward to it. It’s got more interesting as a matter of fact. But, right down deep, I don’t think I’ve changed all that much.” back in the day, still a babe A photo posted by @baddiewinkle on Apr 22, 2014 at 4:55pm PDT In April 2014, Helen was staying with her granddaughter Dawn and her great-granddaughter Kennedy in Knoxville, Tennessee when her life changed forever: “Kennedy was 17 years old and a junior in high school at the time. She came home from school one day to see me wearing a pair of cut-off jeans, a Grateful Dead tie-dye t-shirt and Huf socks. She immediately said “Granna, let’s go take a picture of you and put it on the internet!”” Kennedy’s photo of her “granna” went viral overnight on Twitter, with thousands of favourites and retweets. Out of this one photo, Baddie Winkle was born. Since then, Baddie has amassed 1.6 million followers on Instagram, 226K Twitter followers and 230K Facebook followers. Baddie Winkle is not only a role model for those struggling to come to terms with personal tragedy, but an inspiration to a generation of people refusing to act their age. Sure, she might be pushing 90, but Baddie Winkle doesn’t feel old at all: “I don’t feel old. I’ve never felt old. I’ve never dressed as an old person. I’ve always dressed in young and stylish clothes.” And, stylish she most certainly is – right down to her Instagram bio, which reads: “stealing your man since 1928”. Most importantly of all, Baddie Winkle has allowed Helen Van Winkle to overcome personal tragedy, to reclaim her sense of self as she grows older, and to have fun with her family. #SQUAD A photo posted by @baddiewinkle on Oct 12, 2014 at 12:48pm PDT Dress like Baddie Winkle There’s no such thing as too much tie-dye. Denim cut-offs are a wardrobe essential. Unicorn platform shoes are always a good idea. Invest heavily in novelty sunglasses. Do not leave the house without your Homiès beanie hat. When it comes to slogan t-shirts, go hard or go home. Light-up trainers? A must-have. When in doubt, channel the 1970s. Sequin dresses + faux fur jacket = the perfect combination. Express your music fandom in the best way possible: by wearing it. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T10:53:39.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
