Flexibility, she says, is a key component of what she teaches. “As start-ups mature into bigger companies they sometimes adopt negative characteristics. Things become process-driven, controls fall into place and bureaucracy increases. They start to adopt a protective stance instead of looking forwards,” she explains. “When you start in business you have nothing to protect and everything is in front of you. The habits of big companies slow them down until a maverick business pops up and takes their position in the market.” Start-ups are agile by default. Many begin life as a laptop and a bunch of ideas. Everything is focused on goals and no one is preoccupied by valueless ideas such as how much time someone spends at their desk each day. “Good practices should be enshrined at this stage and locked in as the business grows,” says Sahar. “The big question to ask of your staff is what they need to do a job well, then it is about deliverables and performance, otherwise you are just monitoring ‘presenteeism’ – a very outdated concept.” If people perform, it doesn’t matter whether they are in an office or on a beach Central to any flexible working environment are targets. People have to know what to aim at and, at the end of a project, whether or not they have succeeded. If not, why not? Good businesses check performance all the time and regularly look for ways to improve. “This should be a very target-driven environment. If people perform, it doesn’t matter whether they are in an office or on a beach. People are not motivated by turning up to work, they care about what happens when they get there.” Technology is a key factor in this new thinking. The best tech allows people to communicate easily, collaborate on projects seamlessly and eradicate the downtime that used to be caused by travelling to and from locations. Only a few years ago, being out of the office meant being away from work. Now, if you want it to, work can follow you wherever you go. There is no need for disruption, costly delays or downtime. But a word of caution from Sahar: “That doesn’t mean buying new technology all the time – it’s about buying the tech that helps your employees do their jobs to the best of their ability and makes your business go further.” • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:40:03.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
