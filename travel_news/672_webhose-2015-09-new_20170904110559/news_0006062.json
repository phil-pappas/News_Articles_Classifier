In August, the industry lost some 306,000 rooms compared to last year. That said, total demand was still just below 110 million roomnights which, by the way, is the fourth best room demand month ever.” \nAmong the Top 25 Markets, Denver, Colorado, reported the only double-digit increases in ADR (+10.0% to US$128.16) and RevPAR (+11.5% to US$109.64). Occupancy in the market increased 1.4% to 85.5%. \nDallas, Texas, followed in RevPAR growth with an 8.4% increase to US$64.08. \nSt. Louis, Missouri-Illinois, reported the largest decrease in RevPAR, down 5.7% to US$65.96. \nSeattle, Washington, saw the second largest increase in ADR, up 9.8% to US$180.13. \nThe largest drop in ADR was reported in New York, New York (-3.3% to US$232.76). \nPhoenix, Arizona (+4.9% to 54.6%), experienced the most significant rise in occupancy, while Houston, Texas (-7.6% to 65.5%), saw the steepest occupancy decline. \n“The Top 25 Markets once again outperformed the nation,” Freitag said. “Occupancy was 75.7%, but this was down 1.4% from last year—the same drop as the total U.S.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T17:56:02.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
