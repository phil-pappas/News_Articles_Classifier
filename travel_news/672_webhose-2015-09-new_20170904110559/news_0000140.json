Casino, Power Plant and Power Plant Live! the top three most attended tourist attractions in Greater Baltimore . Together, the three highly-successful destinations attracted over 22 million visitors to the area in 2014.\nMaryland Live! Casino, ranked #1, is one of the largest and most successful casinos in the country, welcoming 10 million visitors per year. Conveniently located in Hanover, MD , halfway between Baltimore, MD , and Washington, DC , Maryland Live! taps into one of the densest regional markets in the U.S. and has become the highest-grossing and most-visited casino in the Mid-Atlantic. The property, which features more than 200 live action table games, approximately 4,000 slot machines, eight restaurants, and a live entertainment venue, is widely recognized as one of the main economic engines in the State, contributing approximately $1 million per day in taxes. Since opening in June 2012 , Maryland Live! has generated $67 million to support Anne Arundel County services and local area improvements. The Casino has also strongly supported local nonprofits and business organizations with millions in both financial and in-kind contributions, and the operation provides millions in funds for business loans to small, minority, and women-owned businesses through the VOLT Loan Program administered by Anne Arundel County Economic Development Corporation. Maryland Live! is also one of the largest employers in the State with 3,000 team members.\nPratt Street's Power Plant , the second most attended tourist destination in Baltimore , was developed in partnership with the City and is considered one of the leading entertainment projects in the United States . The Power Plant is a mixed-use project in the heart of Baltimore's World Famous Inner Harbor that features the Hard Rock Cafe, Barnes and Noble and Maryland's famed Phillips Seafood, along with spectacular loft offices and the headquarters of The Cordish Companies. Prior to The Cordish Companies' involvement, the building sat vacant for approximately ten years in the hands of various developers. Based on its success, the Power Plant was expanded with the construction of the adjacent Pier IV retail/entertainment and office building. Welcoming over 8.5 million visitors each year, the Power Plant continues to be one of the top family-friendly destinations in the country. As a result of its success and positive impact on the community, the Pratt Street Power Plant was awarded the Urban Land Institute Award for Excellence in 2000.\nAttracting over 3.7 million attendees yearly, Power Plant Live! was ranked as the third most attended tourist attraction in 2014 and has become the region's dominant entertainment destination since its launch in 2001. Power Plant Live! is the redevelopment of two vacated city square blocks into an exciting $35 million , 550,000 square foot entertainment district, offering a range of restaurants, bars, comedy and a 1,600-occupany state-of-the-art music venue. Located just one block from Baltimore's Inner Harbor and just a short walk from downtown hotels, Pier Six Concert Pavilion, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Ravens M&T Bank Stadium and other major attractions, Power Plant Live! underwent a $10 million renovation in 2011 and now boasts a soaring outdoor roof covering the main plaza, permanent stage and outdoor LED screen, stunning multi-seasonal beer garden and a circular valet entrance.\n\"It is an absolute honor and testament to all of the hard work of our 5,000 local team members, to see Maryland Live! Casino, Power Plant and Power Plant Live! named as the Baltimore Business Journal's top three tourist attractions in the area,\" said David Cordish , CEO of The Cordish Companies. \"The Cordish Companies was founded, and is headquartered, in Baltimore , so we take great pride in the city as well as the state, and greatly appreciate the loyalty of our visitors.\"\nAbout The Cordish Companies\nThe Cordish Companies' origins date back to 1910 and encompass four generations of privately-held, family ownership.
