Picture: REUTERS Related articles Japanese economy’s contraction a blow for ‘Abenomics’ Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to push for further improvements in corporate governance, including urging companies to make more progress in unwinding cross-held shares.\n\"We must let the governance system make a tangible difference,\" Mr Abe said in a speech at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters on Tuesday, days after he announced new targets for expanding the economy by 20% and halting population decline. \"We are going to build a new system whereby CEOs and other board members should be transparently selected, and cross shareholding further dissolved.\"\nMr Abe was speaking in English to an audience of about 260 investors. The decades-long practice of cross-held shares has come under fire as the government pushes for better use of capital in a nation with an ageing, shrinking population. While the three largest banks had already pledged to sell some holdings, ¥8.5-trillion more in such shares would be off-loaded in the next few years, UBS Group’s wealth management unit said.\nMr Abe came to office in December 2012 touting a three-pronged economic revival plan — unprecedented monetary easing, flexible fiscal policy and regulatory reform — to defeat the deflation that has dogged Japan for more than a decade. While his policies have weakened the yen, lifted stock prices and boosted the profits of some bigger companies, the economy has stuttered with contractions in four of the 10 quarters under his administration.\nThe Bank of Japan’s (BoJ’s) main inflation gauge dropped into negative territory in August, marking the first minus figure since April 2013. In his remarks, Mr Abe said the nation had successfully shrugged off the \"deflation mind-set\".\nThe government would focus on putting the economy on the path to robust growth via a new policy programme called Abenomics 2.0, Mr Abe said.\n\"I am determined, in co-operation with the Bank of Japan, to do whatever it takes to put the economy on a robust growth track,\" Mr Abe said.\nWhen asked how Japan would deal with any fallout from a slowdown in China, Mr Abe said that while Japan’s economic fundamentals were solid, the tight-knit economic ties between the two countries meant there was a need to monitor developments very closely.\n\"If external factors were to cause great confusion in the economy, we would deal with it by conducting fiscal action flexibly,\" he added.\nNo immigration\nUnder Abenomics 2.0, the government will aim to boost the economy to ¥600-trillion, up about 20% from where it is now, and to put more money aside to support early education and bolster the social welfare system.\nImmigration was not currently on the cards as a way of bolstering the population, Mr Abe told reporters at a later press conference, when asked about the possibility of Japan accepting refugees as well as providing them with financial assistance.\n\"In terms of the population problem, there are things we should do before accepting immigrants, such as having women and the elderly be more active and improving the fertility rate,\" he said.\nMr Abe, who in September was appointed to a second three-year term as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters he planned to reshuffle his cabinet and party executive on October 7.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:23:13.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
