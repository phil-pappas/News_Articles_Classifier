More than 2.5 million customers flew with the airline this month and the load factor was close to 90 percent.

The load factor was 89.7 percent, up a solid 6.1 percentage points from the same month last year. 97 percent of the long-haul seats were filled in August.\n“Holidaymakers in the UK and Europe contribute positively to this month’s traffic figures. I’m very pleased that an increasing number of customers in the UK, Germany, Spain and the US choose Norwegian’s high quality flights at affordable fares. It proves that the company is even better equipped to meet the tough international competition going forward,” said CEO Bjørn Kjos.\nNorwegian operated 99.9 percent of its scheduled flights in August, whereof 80.2 percent departed on time.\nThe company took delivery of two brand new Boeing 737-800 aircraft in August, of a total of ten in 2015.
