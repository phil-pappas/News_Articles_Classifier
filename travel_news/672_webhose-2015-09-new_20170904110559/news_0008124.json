or better yet, people come and visit us,” he added.\nNick said the past seven years has completely changed his world view and understanding of what is important in life.\n“We've learned that media doesn't always portray places and people the way that they deserve to be represented and there is often an ulterior motive behind many of the things that we see on TV back home,” he added.\n“We've learned that despite our endless differences and fascinating cultural uniqueness, we are all the same in this world. We all have the same core values and we all love each other.\n“We’re all human and we’re all in this together. That’s probably the most important thing that we've learned from travelling, and our life is better off just by knowing that simple truth.”\nHe and Dariece have written advice for other people considering making travelling a way of life and say they try to make readers realise that what most people dismiss as a dream is, in fact, attainable.\nThe couple sailing the Tobago Cays in St Vincent and The Grenadines\n“We had barely left Canada before 2008 and now we’re travelling full-time, and we had no idea what a blog was before creating ours and now, Goats on the Road funds our travelling lifestyle,” Nick added.\nWhen asked what he would tell anyone considering making a similar move, this was his advice: “If you really want change, then just jump towards a world of freedom and adventure. Don’t put it off another day.\n“Once you take the plunge, there are always safety nets that appear to cushion your fall.\n“One thing is for sure, if you’re heading on the right path in your life, then everything will work out and fall into place.”\nMore about: Backpacking Blogging Travel Travel Guides", "external_links": ["http://www.goatsontheroad.com/"], "published": "2015-09-19T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:34:45.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
