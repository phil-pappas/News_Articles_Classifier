Apparently only approximately 10% reach the Rosette standard, which is awarded solely by the AA Hotel & Restaurant Inspectors with no influence from hotels, restaurants or other guides. The 4-Star Merit Score has also been increased to an impressive 80% out of a maximum score of 84% with the UK average at 77%.\nKate Firth, General Manager said “I am extremely proud of this achievement, which is the culmination of hard work and commitment from the whole team to continue to exceed every aspect of the standards required by the AA. Our guests have also been extremely supportive in testing a host of new dishes over the past few months and their constructive feedback has certainly proved invaluable. I genuinely hope this Rosette accolade will bring new diners and guests to Ye Olde Bell where they will be assured a very warm welcome and a fabulous dining experience!”.\nOver and above the standard of the food and the menu content, the AA Inspector highly rated other aspects in the report commenting: “Hospitality is clearly a strength and all staff members encountered were confident to initiate conversations with guests. Excellent quality of décor throughout including bedrooms, bathrooms and public areas.” Particular mention was made of the attention to picture decor, highlighting the creative mural on the staircase by local artist, Mary Daw of Epworth.\nThe extensive kitchens at Ye Olde Bell, incorporating a large banqueting team, are under the management of Executive Head Chef, Keith Firth, who led the hotel to AA 4-Star for the first time in its 365-year history some six years ago. Richard Allen, Restaurant & Bistro Head Chef, said “The Rosette is something I have aspired to throughout my career and I cannot thank the team enough for their hard work, consistency and commitment towards this achievement”.\nThe restaurant and bistro at Ye Olde Bell continue to offer an extensive menu ranging from the creative Rosette dishes to all the traditional favourites, including their renowned homemade steak and ale pie and daily specials.\nSource:- HBAA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:31:16.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
