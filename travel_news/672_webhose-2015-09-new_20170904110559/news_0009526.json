Caving instructor George Plant who has recently completed the British Caving Association’s (BCA) highest instructing award, the Caving Instructors Certificate (CIC), will deliver the courses that offer three levels: • Introductory Caving – suitable for novices • Intermediate Caving – For those with some previous underground experience who want a taste of the vertical. • Advanced Caving – For those who have experienced caving and want to go further. \nCaving courses begin at £170 per person including full board accommodation. David Sharp, chief executive said: “Caving is a fascinating experience and in North Yorkshire we have the premier caving region in the British Isles. Our skilled and qualified instructors will show students the experiences from a choice of suitable caves where they will discover it is unlike anything else.” The courses are ideal for corporate groups for team building and challenge events for normally desk-bound executives and other adults seeking an extreme adventure experience for leisure. “As alien as scuba-diving or space-travel but available to all, caving provides ‘dirty-learning’ that children and adults can all enjoy“. added George Plant, caving instructor at Carlton Lodge.
