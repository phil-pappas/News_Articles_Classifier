THOMAS, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Passengers aboard the Carnival Liberty are getting an extra day in the U.S. Virgin Islands as authorities evaluate an engine that caught fire on board the cruise ship. The fire broke out Monday while the ship was docked in St. Thomas. The ship was evacuated and there were no injuries. The fire was extinguished by the ship's sprinkler system and people were allowed back on board in the evening.
