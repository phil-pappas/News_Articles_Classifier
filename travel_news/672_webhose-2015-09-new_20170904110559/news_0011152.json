Guests are invited to dine every weekend between 1:00 and 4:00 pm, and embark upon a virtual trip to Valencia as Sea Fu introduces the best paella servings in the city.\nTaking place from Friday, September 18, 2015, weekends will be boosted by a touch of Spanish flair and delicious Mediterranean flavours as unlimited chicken and seafood paella is being served fresh from traditional paella pans. Guests can amble into the beachside restaurant and indulge in a lazy afternoon enjoying spectacular sea views and delving into sumptuous freshly made paella. The offerings are being paired with paella’s perfect partner-in-crime cava, ensuring that the weekend is set off in the ultimate Spanish style.\nThe pathway that leads guests from the heart of the restaurant towards Sea Fu’s fire pit and lounge area will be lined with customary culinary pans teaming with fresh mussels, calamari, white fish and fresh shrimps, filling the restaurant with the aromas of Spain. The paella will be topped off with tangy beef chorizo, bomba rice and warmed with saffron. The Executive Chef Pierre Barusta is ensuring to keep up Spanish bravura with fresh seafood being placed at the heart of the concept. For those who perhaps seek a more substantial offering there is also succulent chicken paella in unlimited supply.\nGuests can relax in the comfort that these offerings are partnered alongside the signature a la carte menu, so whether guests want to set off on a voyage to Valencia or simply seek one of Sea Fu’s signature style dishes, friends and families can rest assured that there will be something for everyone.\nDeriving from “seafood” and “sifu”, meaning “master” in Cantonese, Sea Fu is located along the hotel’s private stretch of natural beach, affording spectacular views of the water and infusing the venue with its signature relaxed charm. A wide variety of unique signature cocktails are available from the venue’s resident mixologists at the Sea Fu Bar, as well as an extensive Mediterranean grape menu.\nIn the evenings the Sea Fu bar offers daily St. Tropez promotions for those looking to continue their experiences. Held between 5:00 and 8:00 pm, guests can enjoy special beverage promotions, as with any drink bought the second one is on Four Seasons.\nSea Fu is open daily for lunch from 12:30 to 4:00 pm and for dinner from 7:00 to 11:00 pm. The Valencia offering is available on Fridays and Saturdays from 1:00 to 4:00 pm.\nSource:- Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T08:08:25.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
