When we first came in on Monday the place was dominated by talk of Sam. The kids all want No 23 shirts. Our first lesson back, period one on Monday, was actually rugby. For the first time in eight years of teaching, I had kids asking me if we could have a rugby team, and the year 12 boys who have played rugby league all the way from year seven were asking us for a sixth-form rugby union side. Call it the “Sam Burgess Effect”. We've had the radio in, the local papers in, and there's just a general buzz around the staffroom. Rugby World Cup 2015 – and Sam Burgess – is the topic of conversation at the moment. There's a reason Sam Burgess is like the Pied Piper for our pupils: there's a connection. We can relate to him. We have little house assemblies and we've been talking about inspirational leaders. Sam's former teachers: Mr Keenleyside, Mr Walker, Mr Rourke, and Mr Donohue Sam has been the highlight of those assemblies this week. We've been talking about how he's come from being a young child at Heckmondwike Grammar School to becoming a Rugby World Cup star, at the heart of this huge clash between England and Wales. The whole school and the community support him, because he supports us. On Sam’s England debut The impact he made on the opening game of the tournament was massive. Some of the young players even remembered what minute he came on. It was the 61st minute. Kids here talk about the number 23 shirt and the positive impact he had on the field. We try to interact with students and talk about things and their take on it. He picked up the other players. He's had a completely positive impact on all of our students. It's weird to see that this boy, this gentle giant who used to be at the grammar school, can go on the pitch and be a complete warrior. It's inspirational for us. I've never really been into rugby union – whether it was the Six Nations or something else. I always remember when I was 18 and there was Jonny Wilkinson and that kick against Australia, but I've never been the one to get into it. Sam has changed codes and gone on to rugby union, though, and that has made me get into it. The whole atmosphere on Friday just gave me goosebumps down my neck. To hear the crowd in the 61st minute go absolutely mental when Sam came on the pitch was a truly great feeling. I thought, I actually know this guy and was a big part of his development. Down at the White Rose Soccer Academy, which I run, they all know I've got a link with Sam, both inside and outside of school. At the sessions, which Sam has turned up to in the past, mums and dads who have never really watched rugby union before have been captivated by Sam, and have taken him to their hearts. On the importance of roots When he was playing at the Rugby League World Cup, Sam and his two brothers invited Heckmondwike Grammar School teacher Simon Keenleyside's son into the changing rooms to meet all the players after the quarter-final game. He cares. He's never forgotten his roots. Special visit: Sam and his two brothers with Simon Keenleyside's son after the Rugby League World Cup quarter-final Sam normally visits us twice a year. He came to one session and came on to the astroturf, and it was just like anybody else coming on to the astroturf. But this was a massive rugby league and rugby union star. He was talking to us for 35 or 40 minutes. The students were all about to go to their next lesson and were still gathered around him wanting to get pictures or autographs, or just a sight of him. It's a strange feeling considering he was at the school just 10 years ago. What we've started to do is integrate a bit of a rugby union session in our warm-up drills. What he has achieved has captured everyone's imagination. I've got 160 boys in my football academy and I always speak to them about Sam Burgess and what a gentle and nice guy he is – and how he's got time for everybody, and how if you support people and nurture them, they will never forget you. But when he crosses the white line, he turns into this warrior. He's such a good role model, not just for the kids I've got at my academy, but for everyone at the school as well. I had no plans to watch this Rugby World Cup until I found out Sam Burgess was playing in it. I'll just send him a text message saying, best of luck, Sam, hope it goes well. That's about it. The kids from school have sent their message. We can't wait to watch the next match now. Everyone at school was wondering whether he would get a start this time. And of course he is... • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:31:32.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
