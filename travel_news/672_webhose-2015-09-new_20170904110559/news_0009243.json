Hong Kong's best kept secrets: Delstore menswear boutique image 1 \nA charming antidote to Hong Kong’s shiny malls and luxury stores is Delstore, an independent menswear boutique on a tiny alleyway in Wan Chai’s hip Star Street area. Browse through rails of lesser known Japanese, American and European brands chosen for their quality, interesting styles and dedication to detail and craftsmanship. \nOwned by Hong Kong native Derrick Leung, the two-storey boutique offers stylish yet inconspicuous men’s outfits and accessories that have way more staying power than those slavishly following seasonal trends (you won’t find any studded-gold high-top trainers here). A true champion of locally curated style, Delstore is a hidden treasure for Hong Kong’s male style mavens. \n3 Schooner St, Wan Chai, Hong Kong.
