I imagined that they couldn’t taste as good as they looked, but then I actually tried one and was immediately hooked. And I’m not even a chocolate person.\nThat’s the great magic of the Mast Brothers: Since starting their eponymous bean-to-bar, Brooklyn-based business in 2007, Rick Mast and Michael Mast have captured the diverse palates of design and food lovers alike with their blends that include Maldon sea salt and Stumptown coffee, and paper patterns inspired by everyone from Franz Kline to vintage couturiers. Now the label that never fails to surprise has officially rebranded itself as Mast with new recipes and packaging. Debuting exclusively on Vogue today, the 12-bar collection will be available in stores next month and includes new offerings like a chocolate made with Kentucky buttermilk, a dark chocolate ground with mint leaves, and a dark chocolate blended with cold-pressed olive oil. As for the revamped logo and wrappers, the designs were borrowed from 1970s and 1980s Italian and American art and sculpture. As creative director Nathan Warkentin explains, “I wanted the new designs to read less as static patterns and more like paintings with movement. They all have a funky, soulful quality.”\nAs the company has grown exponentially over the last several years, the Mast brothers felt that it was time for a bit of change in taste and aesthetic. In addition to the product updates, the Masts have also renovated their stores, updating what used to be rustic interiors with a sleeker, more streamlined vibe. Chocolate person or not, the new Mast is worth unwrapping (and saving the paper, too).", "external_links": ["http://mastbrothers.com/pages/home"], "published": "2015-09-22T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:04:12.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
