(Sanborn) continues to broaden its massive 3-D data collection, including the exciting new option to provide centimeter-accurate 3-D modeling of any building interior, from giant warehouses, retail centers and manufacturing facilities to high-rise office buildings.\nSanborn recently updated its 3-D coverage for multiple metropolitan areas, including updates to the firm's proprietary Citysets building attribute data. Citysets is Sanborn's popular off-the-shelf 3-D product comprising highly accurate vector, raster, elevation and building attributes.\nCitysets building attributes include detailed information about each structure, such as building address, name, construction class, occupancy type, height, year built, square footage and more. This information, coupled with Sanborn's high-resolution 3-D imagery, provides a wealth of value for a wide range of professionals, including real estate developers, urban planners, architectural and engineering firms and emergency operations, to name a few.\nAdditionally, Sanborn now offers the capability to create highly accurate 3-D models of the interior of any building with the Sanborn Platform for Indoor Mapping (SPIN) fully autonomous indoor mapping robot. SPIN utilizes a pair of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors to capture data at better than 3-centimeter accuracy, which can be used to create life-like models of any interior, large or small. The robot is fully autonomous, navigating on its own and avoiding obstacles-including humans-while collecting more than 43,000 precision measurements per second.\n\"Our customers are amazed at how quickly and efficiently SPIN performs its work,\" says Sharad Oberoi , director of IT and software engineering. Oberoi headed the research and development team that created SPIN. \"From the data, we can create highly detailed, measurable 3-D models of the building interior that can be viewed from virtually any angle. Combined with our exterior 3-D building data, Sanborn's complete offering-literally inside and out-is unparalleled in the industry.\"\nSanborn's collection of high-resolution 3-D visualization data now covers the core downtown areas of more than 110 major U.S. and international cities.\nAbout The Sanborn Map Company, Inc.\nSanborn ( www.sanborn.com ) is a preeminent leader in the exploding geospatial industry, delivering state-of-the-art mapping solutions to customers worldwide. The firm currently operates a fleet of 14 aircraft located strategically across the United States .
