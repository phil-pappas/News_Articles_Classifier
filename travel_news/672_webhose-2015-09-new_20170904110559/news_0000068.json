Working together, the website and app allow LGBT travelers to plan their visit to Europe and explore gay and gay friendly venues while they are traveling.\nVespa features up-­‐to-­‐date listings of gay bars, clubs, cafes, saunas, and beaches. All locations include pictures, reviews, ratings and check-­‐ins from other Vespa members, providing travellers with vital information before arrival as well as while traveling. Vespa’s in-­‐language display feature and offline access provides LGBT travellers with additional convenience when conducting location researches with no internet access.\nVespa was created by Christof Wittig, who founded the top gay dating app, Hornet. The app has already garnered much praise from the gay community abroad. It was recently named as “The Most Favourite” app by California’s Frontier Magazine for its easy-­‐to-­‐use features and interactivity with other Vespa users. It is the top downloaded gay travel app in countries such as US, Germany, and Thailand.\n“This collaboration is a great leap forward for LGBT travel in Europe” said GETA Executive Director Carlos Kytka. “GETA’s goal is to improve the LGBT travel experience and in partnering with such an amazing new resource we can now give gay travellers a seamless travel experience when visiting Europe”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T03:35:28.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
