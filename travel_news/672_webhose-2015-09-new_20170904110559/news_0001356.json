Universal Truckload Services, Inc. (NASDAQ: UACL), announced today the planned release of third quarter 2015 financial results after the market closes on Thursday, October 22 , 2015.\nBased on currently available information, we expect to report income from operations in the range of $14.6 million to $16.5 million , on total operating revenues anticipated to range from $283.0 million to $290.0 million . This compares to $23.0 million of operating income in the third quarter of 2014 on revenues totaling $302.1 million . We anticipate earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.27 to $0.31 for the third quarter of 2015, compared to $0.44 per share in third quarter 2014.\nUniversal's financial performance reflects continuing soft demand for truckload transportation services from customers in the steel, energy and selected industrial sectors. Our logistics operations generally continue to operate at anticipated volume levels, but foreign currency impacts and implementation costs at certain operations have restrained operating margins somewhat. Price momentum for our intermodal business has slowed, dampening the rate of growth seen in recent quarters.\nQuarterly Earnings Conference Call Dial-in Details\nWe invite investors and analysts to our quarterly earnings conference call:\nTime:\n10:00 AM EDT\nDate:\nFriday, October 23, 2015\nCall Toll Free:\n(866) 622-0924\nInternational Dial-in:\n+1 (660) 422-4956\nConference ID:\n51064393\nDuring the call, Jeff Rogers , CEO, and David Crittenden , CFO, will discuss Universal's third quarter 2015 financial performance, the demand outlook in our key markets, the impact of pricing, fuel surcharges and foreign currency changes on our revenues and profits, and other trends impacting our business.\nA replay of the conference call will be available beginning two hours after the call through November 19, 2015 , by calling (855) 859-2056 (toll free) or +1 (404) 537-3406 (toll) and using conference ID 51064393.
