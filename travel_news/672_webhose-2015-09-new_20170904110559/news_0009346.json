New research has found that parents who invade their children’s privacy or stop them going out with their friends risk leaving their offspring emotionally scarred in later life. The mentally damaging effects of controlling parents were similar to that of experiencing the recent death of close relative or family friend. “We found that people whose parents showed warmth and responsiveness had higher life satisfaction and better mental wellbeing throughout early, middle and late adulthood,” said Dr Mai Stafford from the MRC unit for Lifelong Heath and Ageing at UCL. “By contrast, psychological control was significantly associated with lower life satisfaction and mental wellbeing. Examples of psychological control include not allowing children to make their own decisions, invading their privacy and fostering dependence.” The study monitored the mental wellbeing of 5,362 participants who were born in 1946 and who completed questionnaires about how well they bonded with their parents . They were asked whether their parents controlled their movements, understood their problems, displayed affection and allowed them freedoms. “We know from other studies that if a child shares a secure emotional attachment with their parents, they are better able to form secure attachments in adult life,” added Dr Stafford. “Parents also give us a stable base from which to explore the world, while warmth and responsiveness has been shown to promote social and emotional development.” The research was published in The Journal of Positive Psychology. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T00:53:40.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
