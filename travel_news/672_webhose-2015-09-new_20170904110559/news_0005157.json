The programme aims to attract young, talented professionals who have advanced university qualifications supplemented with a minimum of two years’ professional working experience in aviation-related regulatory activities and/or in the aviation industry.\n“The sustainability of the industry depends to a large extent on ensuring that we have a strong pool of future professionals running the world’s airports, and these Young Aviation Professionals will be solid proponents of the community of airports and the importance of forging industry partnerships,” said Angela Gittens, Director General, ACI World. “This programme aligns with our suite of Global Training courses, offered both in classrooms and online, and especially the Airport Management Professional Accreditation Programme (AMPAP), another successful collaboration between ACI and ICAO.”\nThe selected candidates will be expected to contribute to each organization’s work programmes related to aviation safety, air navigation capacity and efficiency, air transport economics or aero-political issues, with attention to inter-relationships among ACI, ICAO and IATA. Each Young Aviation Professional will be guided throughout the programme by a subject-matter expert from each of the organizations.\nThe target for the commencement of the programme and the reporting of the selected candidates to Montreal is the end of February 2016. Interested candidates who meet the selection criteria are invited to submit their application at ICAO’s employment site by the closing date of 8 October 2015.\nSource:- ACI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:55:37.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
