Initially the aim was to prevent changes to early retirement benefits but in recent months the pilots have also sought to prevent low-cost expansion at Lufthansa.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-09-10T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:05:45.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
