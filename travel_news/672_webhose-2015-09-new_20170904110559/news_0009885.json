Susie Ellis, Chairman and CEO of GWI said: “The Global Wellness Institute estimates that the top spa growth powerhouse, more than doubling wellness-focused trips from 2012-2017, will be the UAE, with 993,352 trips added and 17.9% annual growth.” \nOther growth markets include Morocco, set to add 825,703 visits and with 14.7% annual growth, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria, also set to see double-digit annual wellness tourism growth to 2017. GWI attribute the luxury day spa, hotel spa and spa resort “explosion” in GCC countries as a major factor behind the region’s spa market boom. Euromonitor forecast spa revenues in the UAE will reach US $495 million by 2019. \n“GWI identify Dubai as the leading growth market in the GCC countries. The Dubai hospitality market is unique in that it is over-saturated with luxury 5-Star resorts and is home to the only 7-Star hotel in the world,” said Christine Davidson, Group Event Director of the dmg events hospitality portfolio including The Leisure Show and The Hotel Show. \n“Within these properties a unique range of extravagant spa treatments have emerged including Dubai’s most luxurious offering, a 24-carat-gold facial, available at the Jumeirah Zabeel Saray. Dubai’s world-class hotel spas and day spas target the growing number of international tourists, the fast-growing local luxury segment and its growing expat community, which is one of the largest in the world.” \nDavidson continued: “So it’s quite appropriate that this year world-class pool and spa suppliers will be in Dubai for the 2nd annual The Leisure Show and the Middle East Pool and Spa Awards 2015 in September. These events are dedicated to showcasing a hugely developing leisure market in the region. A new and valuable addition to The Leisure Show this year is The Hub, featuring pool and spa workshops by Fluidra Middle East, talks on the growth of sports and fitness facilities in hotels by Dubai Sports Council, and live demonstrations on the show floor together with the launch of brand new fitness programs to Dubai by REPs UAE, keeping sports and fitness professionals up to date with the latest trends and crazes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:13:22.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
