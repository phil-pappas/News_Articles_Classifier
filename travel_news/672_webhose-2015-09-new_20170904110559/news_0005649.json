Maybe you have been for a run at lunchtime or worked out in the gym the night before. Perhaps you’ve been watching your diet and trying to cut down on alcohol. Or it could be that you are getting ready for a sponsored bike ride and are relishing the boost that your training regime has given you. Whatever the cause, if you make an effort with your fitness, it brings untold benefits to every sphere of your life. You will feel more positive about your appearance, you will doubtless have more energy and enjoy a better night’s sleep. And, quite probably, you will be much more productive when you’re at work. There is a whole raft of data and scholarly research available that supports this belief. But it’s more or less a matter of common sense. If you feel alert and healthy, you will work more efficiently, keep a clearer focus on what you are doing and are likely to have a lot more get-up-and-go. That explains why Britain’s healthiest companies provide employees with opportunities to maintain and enhance their fitness levels. Not only does it improve their bottom line, by reducing absenteeism and increasing output, it also makes staff feel valued, because their employer cares enough to help them stay in shape. Physical activity / exercise sessions per week Consider the efforts to which Old Mutual goes in its quest to encourage staff fitness. The savings and investment company offers corporate gym membership to its employees, as well as a cycle-to-work scheme and running club, thereby encouraging them to work out on a regular basis. At pharmaceuticals company Sanofi Pasteur MSD, such opportunities are augmented by flexible working hours to increase employee uptake. \"It’s all about creating opportunities for colleagues to work on their fitness then backing that up with positive messaging in the working environment,\" says Sarah Harman, the HR manager. For this reason, its lifts have posters on the walls extolling the merits of taking the stairs. The company also has a health and well-being committee whose remit is to drive forward new initiatives to enhance the health of its staff. \"For example, we’ll be introducing free fruit once a week in the autumn,\" Harman says. \"And a member of the team is a qualified nutritionist, so she will be offering workshops to encourage healthy eating.\" Such workshops are part of a series of \"lunch and learn\" sessions, designed to give employees the know-how to look after themselves. It’s something that Old Mutual also offers its staff in the form of regular seminars. And both companies back things up with healthy meal choices in the staff canteen, because they recognise the role that diet plays in living well. A similar approach is adopted by sportswear company Sweaty Betty, which has a history of success in Britain’s Healthiest Company . \"Our working hours are not carved in stone,\" explains the company’s PR manager, Elodie Graham. \"We encourage staff to take the time to exercise, so we’re fine with people leaving early to attend their spin class. We also often see lunch breaks turn into group runs or yoga sessions.\" Of course, you may be surprised if the people working for a sportswear manufacturer didn’t have an interest in health and fitness. But it helps that staff are encouraged to take part in regular exercise by their employer, and given the time to do so. This is a particular feature of another of Britain’s healthiest companies, which shares Sweaty Betty's sporty interests. We’re showing people that we value them enough to help them live healthily Adidas (UK) has been operating a much-admired employee wellness programme since 1997. It is outsourced to Wellness International, whose chief executive Tricia Kalloo is proud that adidas has achieved a hat-trick of victories in Britain’s Healthiest Company since the inception of the awards in 2013. \"We offer a balanced approach in which every employee is given bespoke support to enhance their well-being and fitness,\" she explains. \"When it comes to the latter area we offer on-site gym facilities, bike storage, and shower and changing facilities to encourage people to run or cycle to work. What’s more, adidas employees have access to qualified exercise physiologists, meaning that a fitness regime can be designed around their precise abilities and aspirations.\" That’s all well and good, but the key question from an employer’s perspective is likely to be simple and direct: does it make a difference to the company’s success? Kalloo is unequivocal on this point. \"Fitter employees are more productive and have fewer ongoing health complaints,\" she says. \"But the most striking thing is the positive culture that’s been established at adidas. Staff health and well-being matters to this company, and the presence of our wellness centre reinforces that point.\" In essence, she concludes, that's the real benefit of encouraging employees to keep fit. It may yield tangible benefits but it’s the unquantifiable impact of attitude that makes the biggest difference. \"We’re showing people that we value them enough to help them live more healthily. That has to be a good thing.\" Visit telegraph.co.uk/britainshealthiestcompany to find out how winners have benefited from the 2015 Britain's Healthiest Company awards, or sign up to the 2016 awards here »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T23:01:50.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
