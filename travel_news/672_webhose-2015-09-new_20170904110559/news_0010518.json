In 2005, “gorilla tourists” numbered about 10,500 and the number has increased over the years to about 23,400 people in 2014. The sector has recorded an increase of 4 percent in term of revenues which was estimated at 304.9 million dollars in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:19:29.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
