Features: Dominated by an expanse of grass bordered by the Rijksmuseum , Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum (currently under renovation and located behind Centraal Station). North area includes a reflecting pool (ice-skating rink in winter), food vendors (seasonal), museum shops, a full-service restaurant (Cobra Café), a basketball court and a skating half pipe. Attracts mostly museum-going visitors and neighborhood locals (yours truly!). Ideal for picnicking, rollerblading/skateboarding (on half pipe), sports (frisbee, soccer, basketball I've even seen cricket!) and generally lounging. Striking view of the Rijksmuseum makes this a favorite visitor photo spot. Host to outdoor concerts on Queen's Day (April 30) and the Remembrance Days (May 4-5), as well as during various festivals. Southeast area of the park features two WWII memorials: the Ravensbrück Monument, which commemorates the women prisoners of the Nazi concentration camp of the same name; and the Gypsy Monument, which honors the Roma and Sinti (a more acceptable name for this ethnic group) victims of the war.
