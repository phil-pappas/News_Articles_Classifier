Actually, it's a whole lot more. It's all about spas, too, and the forest setting is particularly calming. PUBLISHED: 13:10, Sat, Sep 5, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:25, Sat, Sep 5, 2015 PH The cool, calm pool at the heard of the Aqua Sana in family friendly Centre Parcs in Elveden Forest \nThe Aqua Sana spa is housed in a separate building from the main complex, although on the same site, and offers overnight spa breaks. \nThere was a welcome treat for me and my partner of tea, coffee, and juice, or even Prosecco, which really set me at ease, before setting off on a personal tour of the facilities at Elveden Forest in Suffolk. \nWith 14 spa experiences including Aqua Meditation Room, peaceful Tyrolean Garden, Balinese steam bath, outdoor pool, plus a wealth of massage and facial treatments, I decided this was heaven - and I hadn't even seen my Luxury Spa Suite. \nThe suite was contemporary and stylish yet had a warm, homely, relaxing and inviting feel. The décor is impressive, too, all earthy yellow, green and brown furniture and fittings. \nThe bathroom had a walk-in shower, fragrant beauty products and his and hers sinks, while in a separate room, there was an oversized bathtub (big enough for two) where you could watch TV while having a relaxing soak or, as I did, listen to soothing music with my balcony doors open as I enjoyed the sun and breeze. The balcony had a large sunlounger as well as table and chair. \nThe kitchenette, with espresso machine and fridge, had a table and chairs, should you choose to have a meal delivered. An inviting king-size bed dominated the bedroom but there was still enough space to move around freely, while the front room had a large sofa as well as a desk. All I had to do was don my cosy robe and slippers, grab a towel and go Cherry Jervis \nWith direct access to the World of Spa where all the action (or, possibly, inaction) was, all I had to do was don my cosy robe and slippers, grab a towel and go. \nAnd because it is all indoors, I could stay in my robe all day, even for lunch in the bright Vitale café with its Mediterranean fare. \nI started my World of Spa experience with the multisensory shower to get my circulation moving and my pores open, then it was on to the foot spa to soak my tired feet before heading to the Japanese salt steam bath, which works wonders for your respiratory system. It was a brilliant way to prepare for my treatments. \nI had the 55-minute Indulgent treatment, part of the Luxury Spa Package, which consisted of a smooth-feeling full-body exfoliation. It really is so relaxing having someone do that for you. \nA quick shower was followed by full-body moisturisation, which left my skin feeling soft and refreshed before I enjoyed a mini facial, courtesy of a mask that seemed to warm up as it was spread and massaged across my face. \nWhile that did its magic, I had the choice of a hand, foot or scalp massage. I opted for the foot massage, so I really had been pampered from top to toe.
