Parts of it will float on water, Redzepi said.\nThe celebrated kitchen will move away from traditional tasting menus in favour of dishes reflecting the season even more closely than they already do, resulting in a variety of wild game in the autumn, seafood in winter and a completely vegetarian menu in spring and summer.\nBusiness at Noma - where booking a table can be near impossible - was still booming, but the move was necessary to \"progress\", Redzepi said.\nA Noma spokesman confirmed the closure to AFP on Tuesday but declined to comment further.\nThe two-Michelin-star restaurant grabbed the number one spot in Restaurant magazine's prestigious annual ranking in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014.\nThis year it finished third behind Spain's \"El Celler de Can Roca\" and Italy's \"Osteria Francescana\".\nIt is currently based in a converted 18th-century shipping warehouse, where it has become a favourite of gourmets worldwide for using seasonal and local ingredients in dishes like pike perch and cabbages, and wild duck and pear.\nIn January Noma will begin a 10-week stint in Sydney, following a similar trend that saw it relocate to Tokyo for several weeks this year.\n\"We're bringing the entire team, from dishwasher to general manager,\" Redzepi said on the restaurant's website.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:39:19.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
