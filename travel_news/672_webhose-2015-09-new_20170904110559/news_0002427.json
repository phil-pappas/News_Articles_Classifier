One iconic name in San Diego joining this charge is Mossy Automotive Group, with the MOSSY ECO BUCKET CHALLENGE.\nOn July 1, 2015 , the City's mandatory watering restrictions were strengthened to limit customers to watering their outdoor landscaping for a maximum of 2 days a week, 5 minutes per day. The 5-minutes-per-day time limit does NOT apply to landscape irrigation systems using water-efficient devices or techniques, including drip and micro-irrigation systems, stream rotor sprinklers and hand watering.\nEveryone in San Diego County is encouraged to stop by any of the 14 Mossy automotive dealerships throughout the county to pick up a FREE bucket to use in their water-saving efforts while supplies last. It is all a part of the Mossy Eco bucket Challenge. These buckets can be used creatively to save thousands of gallons of water each year countywide.\nHere are 5 ways these buckets can be used to combat California's severe drought:\nUse the bucket to collect water from the shower while you wait for the hot water to arrive. Use a small amount of water in the bucket to wash fruits and vegetables instead of washing them under a running faucet. Fill the bucket with water and dish soap and use this to wash dishes throughout the day. Keep one bowl, plate, and glass on hand for every family member and wash them in the bucket after each use. Collect the water emitted by window or central air conditioning units. Many can produce as much as five gallons per day. If you take baths rather than showers, use the bucket to transport used bathwater for other uses throughout the house. Collected water can be used in many resourceful ways around the house. Fresh water can be used for cooking like boiling pastas or eggs and can also be used to clean dishes, for brushing teeth, or chilled for drinking water. Gray water, or water that has been used but does not contain harmful chemicals or contaminants, can also be utilized. This includes bathwater, dishwater, and even the water from a washing machine provided no chemical detergents are used. This water can be used for indoor or outdoor plants.\nIt is also possible to flush a toilet using fresh or gray water simply by pouring water from the bucket into toilet tank. Just take off the lid, pour the water, and watch the toilet flush itself! Not only is it saving water, it is a fun science experiment to entertain the kids (or yourself) while teaching a valuable lesson about saving our most precious resource.\nFrom Vista to Chula Vista , Mossy Automotive Group wants to do its part in bringing this drought to an end and the Mossy Eco Bucket Challenge is one way to do it. Buckets are available at every location now and county residents are welcome to stop by during regular business hours to pick one up and join in the effort.\nJoin the effort online and be entered to win 1 of 3 $100 Visa gift cards! Post a picture or video on how you use your bucket to conserve water and include #EcoBucketChallenge on one of Mossy's Official Facebook, Twitter or Instagram social media pages and you could be a lucky winner! Check out www.Mossy.com for more details.\nEvery drop of water we save today is one drop that can be used tomorrow and, when so few are falling from the sky these days, every drop in the bucket helps.\nABOUT MOSSY AUTOMOTIVE GROUP\nThe Mossy Automotive Group is a family owned and operated business.
