Starting on April 4, 2016, Austria’s national carrier will operate a Boeing 777 to Shanghai throughout the entire year. In April 2016 the flights will be offered five times a week, as of May 1, 2016 on a daily basis. This is the airline’s second destination in China in addition to Beijing. The flight time from Vienna to Shanghai at a distance of more than 8,500 kilometers from Vienna will be about 10 hours 20 minutes. The destination is not only interesting as a point-to-point route but also for transfer traffic. About two-thirds of passengers will transfer at the Vienna hub and continue their journeys, flying particularly to Western and Eastern European destinations.\nAt present Austrian Airlines offers a total of 26 weekly nonstop flights to Asia in its summer flight schedule. In addition to 5 flights per week to Beijing, the airline also offers up to 7 flights per week to Delhi operating a Boeing 767. Bangkok and Tokyo are serviced with daily flights on a Boeing 777. Furthermore, it is launching flight service once per week to the tourist destination of Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka, starting October 27, 2015. “Shanghai will complement our offering to the most important cities of Asia very well”, explains Andreas Otto, Chief Commercial Officer of Austrian Airlines. “In this way we are resolutely expanding flight service on long-haul routes.”\nAustrian Airlines had already included Shanghai in its flight schedule starting on April 28, 2004. However, flight service was terminated in January 2007 as part of the redimensioning of the airline’s long-haul fleet and the related decommissioning of all its Airbus A330 and A340 long-haul aircraft. “Shanghai once again offers potential thanks to the significantly improved market environment and increased local demand”, CCO Otto adds.\nSource:-Austrian Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:07:50.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
