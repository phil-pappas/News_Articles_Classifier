My partner is going to work completely exhausted.\nI work from home, I hear that sound every 3 or 4 minutes and it's really quite debilitating, in fact it sort drives you mad.\n– Lynda Bailey Credit: ITV News The upgrade work closed the line between Walthamstow Central and Seven Sisters in August. Work designed to increase capacity to up to 36 trains an hour. But the impact on people here has been enormous.\nWhen we moved into our house four years ago, we knew there was a gentle rumble from trains on the Victoria Line passing under our house, however, this increased dramatically after the engineering works finished in late August.\nSuddenly we could hear a loud and thundery 'clackety-clack' noise as each train passed underneath our house. It's affected me in particular as I work from home - I'm trying to write my PhD thesis, for which I really do need peace and quiet. But it's affected the rest of my family too, as the noise can be heard in the bedrooms and we can hear it when we are trying to get to sleep and then when it starts up again in the morning. What we are particularly worried about is the plan to introduce 24-hour tube trains, which would mean disturbance throughout the night. I love living in London and, of course, I accept some noise as part of that. But this noise, which is sounds like a train running through the room next door, is just unacceptable.\n– Polly Corrigan, Resident Credit: ITV News TfL says the installation of new track was in fact to make the line smoother, and more reliable. But one joint is out of kilter which is what has been causing the noise.\nIt's not the greatest outcome, frankly. When we thought we were doing something really good, replacing old rail for new.\nBut, we'll get this fixed tonight - and afterwards I'm absolutely certain the residents will feel the benefit of that.\n– George McInulty, London Underground's Programme Director of Infrastructure Credit: ITV News Those who live along the affected roads hope tomorrow to be woken up by their alarms and not the first tube.\nPlay video Last updated Tue 15 Sep 2015 Travel London", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/luketomhanrahan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"], "published": "2015-09-16T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T15:09:06.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
