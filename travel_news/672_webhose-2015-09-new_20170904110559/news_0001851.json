Pacquiao lost to Mayweather in May in boxing's richest fight. \n\"I do not need to give away plane tickets and spend a lot of money to showcase the beauty of our province,\" he said with a broad smile. Pacquiao is known to spend large amounts to bring along his huge entourage to watch his fights. \nDomingo Ramon Enerio III, the chief operating officer of the Tourism Promotions Board, said tourism is a \"feel good industry\" which contributed $6 billion to the Philippine economy last year. \nThe government statistics agency has reported that tourism contributed 7.8 percent to the economy last year. \nEnerio said the government is confident the Philippines will surpass 5 million visitors for the first time this year. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T16:12:39.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
