Works were also done to the foyer, karaoke room entrance and restrooms on the 47 th floor, as well as the banquet rooms on the lower levels which now offers wireless and local area network facilities. \n\nBeside function rooms on the the top floor, the hotel has multipurpose venues on the fourth and fifth floors. \n\nHotel spokesperson, Sunaho Nakatani, told TTGmice e-Weekly that the renovations were made to improve the hotel’s product for events and maintain the high quality of venues and experiences the hotel is known for. \n\n“Our banquet and event facilities are very popular and our largest venue, the Concord Ballroom, enjoys a high occupancy of 90 per cent throughout the year,” added Junko Saito, deputy director of marketing and PR. \n\nThe hotel hosts some 80 academic and international conventions a year and is regarded either the first or second top hotel venue for events in Japan, with its closest rival being a property in Kansai, according to Saito. \n\nSaito said: “Our hotel is among the best in Shinjuku and Tokyo, and despite our room rates rising every year, we’ve been able to enjoy a healthy average occupancy rate of 89 to 90 per cent. Our rooms aren’t cheap, so we work hard to make sure experiences and service standards are excellent. Our marketing efforts now are aimed at strengthening the hotel’s branding.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T09:59:16.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
