At its summit in China, entitled “Charting a New Course for Growth”[1], leaders from industry, academia and government will explore new paths to prosperity based on innovation, collaboration and partnership.\nDesso and Tarkett are supporters of the circular economy – the regenerative, sustainable model in which goods are designed to be recycled, reused or remanufactured in a closed loop system.Together, the companies are harnessing their combined experience and commitment to building a truly sustainable economic model that delivers innovation and added value to customers.\nAccording to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the management consultants, McKinsey & Co., industry could save as much as a trillion dollars a year by 2025[2] through cost savings on materials as a result of going circular.\nDesso is a steering group member of Project MainStream[3], a multi-industry and CEO-led global initiative to accelerate business-driven innovation and help scale up the circular economy. The initiative is organised by the World Economic Forum and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\nDuring the summit, Tarkett and Desso will be taking part in two circular economy related sessions: a private session on Wednesday 9th September on ‘Tackling a Sea of Plastic’, and a public session on Friday 11th September focused on ‘Mapping Solutions: Environment and Resource Security’.\n“We are delighted to be taking part in such an important event and to be able to contribute with our thoughts on developing a positive way forward for sustainable economic growth, which is very much in line with our overall company goals,” says Remco Teulings, President EMEA for Tarkett.\n“At Desso, we have been on our Cradle to Cradle® journey since 2008 and that has provided us with valuable experience of the processes and challenges that need to be tackled. In Dalian, we will meet and engage with other leaders in science, business and government to share ideas on these crucial issues,” says Roland Jonkhoff, Managing Director of Desso and Vice President Carpet EMEA for Tarkett.\nSource:- Tarkett", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:32:57.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
