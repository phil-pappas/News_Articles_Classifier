Just because Labor Day signifies the end of summer, it doesn't mean its the end of enjoying the outdoors and the activities taking place throughout the state parks in Michigan. \" This fall, the state parks and recreation areas will be hosting lots of harvest festivals and 'haunted' parks,\" said Stephanie Wirtz, recreation programmer for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. \"Some events are open to the general public, others are for campers only.\" Bob Wild, Department of Natural Resources interpreter at Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, offers one suggestion. \"A visit to the Porcupine Mountains offers some of the best fall colors anywhere. There are 79 state parks in Michigan, and the DNR has a handy guide to all the events taking place in the parks. Visit the DNR's website to see a list of harvests and haunts scheduled for September and October. Here are some of the events: Chairlift rides in the Porcupines If you have some vacation time left , and don't mind a bit a of a drive, Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Parks is kicking off its fall activities by opening of chairlift rides, giving visitors spectacular, panoramic views of western Upper Peninsula and the Porcupine Mountains. Park interpreter Bob Wild also suggested guests take part in the other fall activities being offered at the park. \"Ride the chairlift to the top of the ski hill and either hike or ride the lift back down for some great scenery overlooking Lake Superior,\" Wild said. He added, that guests shouldn't forget to bring a camera. The chairlift rides are available noon-7 p.m., Sept. 26-27 and Oct. 3-4. Cost is $5 per person, children age 12 and younger are free.
