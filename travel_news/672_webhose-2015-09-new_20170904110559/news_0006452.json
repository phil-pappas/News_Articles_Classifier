This city is not built for walking, so the hotel offers complimentary chauffeuring locally, plus a Saturday service to the Galleria shopping centre. From £195 per night \nFor a hip take on luxury, try Hotel ZaZa , which is handily located near to the museums and parks. It offers a spa, outdoor pool with black-and-white striped loungers, themed suites (fancy a stay in the “Tycoon”, anyone?) and “Big Flirt” martinis. From £162 per night Eat \nUchi has excellent sushi, yucca chips, and charred Brussels sprouts (a big draw locally, honest). \nThe breakfast and brunch options at Tiny Boxwoods include avocado and egg, and “Lovin’ Canada” (two hard-boiled eggs, artisan bread, house jam, whipped honey butter). Arrive early or be prepared to queue. \nPondicheri restaurant \nPondicheri offers Indian street food with a Texan bent, such as the “Rancher” thali, or even French toast covered with berries and jaggery syrup. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with a bakery upstairs. Drink \nProp up the bar in Brasserie 19 , which is also a French restaurant. Incidentally, it was named one of the best places to meet a rich husband by US Town & Country magazine. \nInventive without being pretentious, the Anvil Bar & Refuge has a 13-page drinks menu. Shop \nThe Galleria is the largest mall in Texas with more than 375 stores, 50 restaurants, an ice rink and a jogging track on the roof. \nSweet tooth? Make for The Chocolate Bar , which sells all things chocolatey: cakes, drinks and “pizza” with white chocolate “cheese”. \nA vintage Chanel bag from More Than You Can Imagine \nMore Than You Can Imagine specialises in second-hand designer clothing, accessories and shoes. Do \nVisit Rothko’s Chapel , where 14 of the abstract artist’s momentous canvases are displayed in a serenely empty interior. \nA butterfly at the Museum of Natural Science \nThe Houston Museum of Natural Science houses the Cullen Hall collection of rare gemstones, as well as 1,500 live butterflies in the Cockrell Butterfly Center. \nDiscover a subterranean network of walkways, shops and restaurants, about 20 feet under Houston’s downtown streets, on the Above and Below guided tour . You’ll also take in sweeping views from some of Texas’s tallest buildings.
