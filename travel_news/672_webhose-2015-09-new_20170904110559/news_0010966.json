Med Expert Chile selects top private hospitals that are Joint Commission-accredited, have lower costs and lower rates of hospital-acquired infections than the United States, and some of the best track records for overall patient safety. \nMedical Travel Today (MTT): Tell our readers how you got involved in the medical travel space. \nDr. Lee Vliet (LV): Years ago, I was a domestic medical traveler in need of special case spine surgery. And, while I had my own experience traveling for serious medical care, I wasn’t actively involved in the industry until around 2009 when the key issues of healthcare reform began circulating. \nAs the concept of medical travel began to boom, I started to explore a number of countries where I might be able offer high-quality, cost-effective services. \nFrom my research, I found several countries in Latin America to have some of the safest, highest quality and patient-centered facilities. Doctors spend much more time with patients in South America than the average U.S. patient is accustomed to. \nA lot of medical travel companies are doing a “good job” finding locations that offer certain procedures, but basically, they are just travel agencies focused on medical services. From my research, it appears patients are not generally receiving appropriate physician-led pre-screening and medical consultation, which can result in a number of unnecessary procedures. \nI have been a patient advocate my entire career, and in 1986 I had resigned from all insurance contracts because they would deny procedures that patients needed and only schedule procedures that the insurance companies would cover. I could not in good conscience violate my Oath of Hippocrates by catering to insurance or government demands over patients’ needs. I went into Medicine to serve the patients. \nToday, my medical travel platform is designed to provide that continuity of care, including evaluation and guidance before, during and after treatment. \nMTT: Does your platform strictly serve patients traveling to Chile for care? \nLV: We are developing relationships with Joint Commission International-accredited hospitals in both Central and South America in an effort to provide more diversity to the patient. \nCurrently, I am the chief medical officer for Med Expert Chile, SpA, which is a subsidiary of Med-Expert Global, LLC, and only works with hospitals and facilities that are accredited by the Joint Commission International. In the fall of 2015, Med Expert Global is negotiating to add JCI-hospitals and will operate as Med Expert Columbia, and Med Expert Panama. Under this brand, we are able to offer insurance carriers, businesses and the individual patient a selection of hospitals depending upon patient needs, specialist services available, as well as provide research on infection and complication rates of surgeons and facilities. I am also the medical consultant for International Health Strategies, SpA, which has a contract with a top private hospital in Santiago accredited by the Chilean government. \nMTT: Is there a tremendous price differentiation between procedures in the U.S. and Chile? \nLV: At this point, the price differential is running around 50 – 80 percent lower in Latin America in comparison to the U.S. \nAnd, just because the prices are lower does not mean that patients aren’t receiving high-quality care. I would never promote a facility or physician I had not researched to first insure optimal quality. In particular, the facilities in Santiago that Med Expert Chile refers patients to are among the top four private hospitals in Chile – with lower infection rates and better safety ratings than the top facilities near me in Arizona! For example, in January 2015, 21 percent of Arizona hospitals were hit with federal penalties due to high injury and infection rates. \nMTT: At this point is there anything else you would like to share with our readers? \nLV: As I previously mentioned, I am very passionate about providing high-quality, cost-effective care to my patients. Over the years, I have received impressive patient success stories, and I look forward to sharing these stories with the readers of Medical Travel Today over the course of the next few months! \nShare this: 118 articles posted.
