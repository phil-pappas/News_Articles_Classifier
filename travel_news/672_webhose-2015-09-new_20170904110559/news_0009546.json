If that person were to travel from Manchester to Auckland (approx. 11,311 miles) they would pay £71. This represents a tax premium per mile of 19 times for the UK domestic business traveller over the long haul traveller, Flybe said.\nHammad added: “There is absolutely no logic in such an unfair discriminatory tax regime. If the Government is serious about fostering economic development in UK regions, it should continue to support aviation rather than just spending billions subsidising rail projects such as HS2 and HS3 which will not be delivered for decades.\n“The availability of affordable, high-quality air service connectivity is fundamental to the economic prosperity of the whole of the UK”\nLast week, the Scottish government confirmed plans to scrap APD after certain powers were devolved after the independence vote.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-09-14T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T21:57:31.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
