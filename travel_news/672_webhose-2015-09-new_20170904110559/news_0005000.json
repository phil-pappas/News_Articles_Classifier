The new menu follows a distinct French contemporary fine dining concept and includes delicacies such as ‘Duck Magret’ with candied oranges and pink grapefruits and ‘Lobster Tail’ accompanied by finely sliced mango, avocado, celeriac, and citrus butter sauce.\nFenesse is already a favourite with couples who love to enjoy the romantic sunsets from its private overwater tables which offer uninterrupted views over the shimmering lagoon. The restaurant is set slightly away from the resort and is accessible over a gentle winding jetty, which provides its patrons with an intimate and tranquil ambiance. Fenesse has reinforced its allure as a private couple’s retreat within the resort.\nHighly acclaimed Chef William earned a place in the prestigious Michelin Guide with his own restaurant in Mauritius in 2007. He counts Chef Maxime Luvara, a renowned Master Chef who currently heads the cuisine at Burj Al Arab Jumeirah, Dubai, as his inspiration.\nIncorporating influences from his experience across five-star kitchens together with his own roots in the Creole and French cuisine, Chef William has created a new signature dish at Fenesse that is sure to delight the guest’s taste buds: the Slow Cooked Barramundi, served with clams mussels marinière style, linguine, asparagus and dipped in Chardonnay foam.\nGraham Kiy, General Manager, said: “Chef William has a unique vision that he literally brings to the table in everything he does and we admire his passion and flair with which he produces one more magical dish after the other. I am sure that our guests will be delighted to have the chance to taste authentic French recipes prepared by this talented Chef at Jumeirah Vittaveli.”\nSource: Jumeirah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:06:43.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
