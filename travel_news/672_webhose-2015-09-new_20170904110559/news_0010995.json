The day began with the official opening of the conference, where attendees heard His Excellency Juan Carlos Varela Rodriguez, President of the Republic of Panama; Joseph Fidanque III, General Manager, Tocumen International Airport; Hector Navarrete, Director of Regional Airports, ASUR and President, ACI Latin America-Caribbean; Fredrick Piccolo, President and CEO, Sarasota Manatee Airport Authority and Chair, ACI World; and Jorge Quijano, Chief Executive Officer, Panama Canal Authority speak variously on airports’ significant contributions to their local economies; Panama’s important place in the world as the hub of the Americas; Tocumen International Airports’ impressive new Terminal 2; and the importance of planning now for future challenges and opportunities.\nThe conference opening was followed by two sessions: “A day in the life of an airport CEO in 2025,” wherein panelists provided insights on the future of airports, including their strategic visions, challenges and opportunities, and “Waves of the future,” which featured presentations focusing on the ways in which airports can cater to an emerging group of air travelers—the generation of passengers that will be traveling for the next three to four decades. ACI also celebrated this year’s graduates of the ACI-ICAO Airport Management Professional Accreditation Programme (AMPAP); held the ACI World General Assembly and the ACI Latin America-Caribbean Regional Assembly; and congratulated 2015 ACI scholarship recipients.\n“We accomplished a lot yesterday,” noted Angela Gittens, Director General, ACI World, “but I always say my favorite part of WAGA every year is congratulating our AMPAP graduates. In line with the theme of this year’s conference, ACI, along with ICAO, its partner in the AMPAP initiative, is committed to ensuring that the airport industry has a deep talent pool from which to draw in the coming years. This year’s AMPAP graduates are proof positive that our future is in good hands.”\n“Yesterday was an excellent start to what is a comprehensive conference programme that will continue on 2 September with three more sessions dedicated to ensuring that airports build a future that is safe, secure and a sustainable,” added Javier Martinez Botacio, Director General, ACI Latin America-Caribbean. “I’m particularly pleased to note that WAGA 2015 has set an attendance record for ACI events in Latin America-Caribbean. The presentations we’ve seen today and during the pre-conference programme make it clear that the region is on the cutting edge where airport development is concerned.\n“We’re fortunate to have the opportunity here in beautiful Panama during this event to both learn from other regions’ successes and communicate our own victories,” Martinez Botacio continued. “More than anything, it is through this spirit of collaboration and mutual support that the world’s airports will create a solid foundation for future growth.”\nWAGA 2015 continues on 2 September with the second half of the main conference programme.
