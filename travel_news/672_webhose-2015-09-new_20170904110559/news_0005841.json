Two options will be available: either 28 or 52 pages with no difference in cost. \nSprague noted that more than 90% of passports that are returned have less than two pages used. \nMany countries require passports be valid for six months on arrival, so agents should check on this. Agents should also be aware that passports for children under 16 are valid only for five years. \nPassport season In the past “passport [application and renewal] season” began in mid-January, peaked in March and then ran steadily through August before trailing off, said Sprague. \nSince last year, the trend has been for it to continue rising throughout the year. “This summer, it never slowed down,” Sprague noted. \nWhile passports aren’t required for cruises that begin and end in U.S. ports, Sprague said agents should encourage clients to obtain passports anyway, noting that people may get sick or injured when visiting ports and have to fly back. \nAnd when clients lose their passports, agents should have them check thoroughly before reporting it because once the passport is reported missing, it can’t be reinstated even if it’s found, Sprague said. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T03:41:13.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
