Do you ever think about what happens to such materials after each flight, or the effort that goes into producing inflight items in a more environmentally friendly way?\nThe effective management of resources and the reduction of energy consumption and wastage are important elements of Cathay Pacificâ€™s sustainability strategy. In our continuous strive to provide a premium service and to reduce the impact these services have on the environment, we have implemented a wide range of environmental initiatives, including the use of sustainable materials and the collection, classification, recycling and reuse of inflight items.\nThe Cathay Pacific Environmental Affairs Department is happy to share with the media more about practices relating to handling used inflight materials and sustainable sourcing.\nSource:- Cathay Pacific", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:01:06.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
