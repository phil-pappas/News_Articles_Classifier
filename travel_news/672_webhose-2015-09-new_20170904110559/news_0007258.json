Under this new agreement, Caterpillar will take over responsibility for manufacturing, marketing and sales of Seeing Machines' existing DSS rugged off-road product. In addition, Seeing Machines and Caterpillar will work together to develop new innovative products. Caterpillar will market DSS and Seeing Machines Fleet products for in-cab operator fatigue and distraction monitoring solutions in the agreed Caterpillar industries. Finally, Caterpillar will also have distribution rights for Seeing Machines Fleet product, exclusive within agreed Caterpillar industries and nonexclusive outside these industries.\nGlobal Agreement\nSeeing Machines' DSS rugged off-road product, under license to Caterpillar, will be available exclusively through Cat ® Dealers across Caterpillar's broader industries; including mining, construction, quarry, aggregates, cement, and forestry.\nCaterpillar will pay Seeing Machines US$17.5M over four years as well as royalty fees for DSS hardware, software licensing, monitoring and analytics services. Caterpillar will also purchase existing inventory of DSS units from Seeing Machines. Current DSS customer agreements will be transitioned to Caterpillar and supported by Caterpillar dealers. Additional consulting services, system monitoring and data analysis will be offered by Caterpillar Safety Services.\nSeeing Machines CEO, Ken Kroeger said: \"This is a pivotal moment in the history of Seeing Machines; the realisation of several years of hard work for both companies. Caterpillar is capable of maximising the return on the DSS technology; their reputation, reach, capability and commitment will deliver great outcomes for both companies and for the world's mining and construction related companies.\"\nSeeing Machines Fleet Distribution Rights\nIn addition to the rugged off-road DSS product, Caterpillar will also distribute Seeing Machines' Fleet product, exclusively within agreed Caterpillar industries and nonexclusive outside these industries.

In parallel with this agreement Seeing Machines will continue to work with Caterpillar's wholly owned subsidiary, Electro Motive Diesel, to assess and develop operator monitoring technology solutions for the rail industry, under the alliance agreement with EMD announced in September 2014.\nAbout Seeing Machines\nSeeing Machines , (AIM: SEE) is focused on operator monitoring and intervention sensing technologies and services.
