As I was walking out of Twickenham after the game, I saw Sam Warburton ’s mother and father, Jez and Carolyn, and Sam’s wife Rachel. “Halfway through the game I said I was never coming back to Twickenham again,” Rachel told me. “Then, at the end of the game, I said I can’t wait to come back.” As a player, you’re out there and doing your thing on the pitch – what’s natural to you – but it’s a different story for the families. It’s a roller­coaster of emotions for them. They go through the mill. As a player, and even since retiring, I’ve often looked at games from more of a clinical or tactical point of view than an emotional one, but this game was a totally different experience. The adrenaline was incredible. As a commentator, it really was like being a fan, which I haven’t experienced for a long time. Incredible feeling, incredible event. Sam Warburton’s aggressive side Sam Warburton is an enigma . If he walked in with your daughter you’d say what a lovely bloke he is. He’s so nice. There’s no edge to him at all. But then you see him play, and he’s a machine, a beast. He keeps everything within the laws and Saturday was the first time I’ve seen him get involved in anything, in that moment with Mike Brown where they were squaring up. Sam and I had some contact the day before the game. He said: “It feels like we’ve been here before.” That stuck in my head and made me think they’d win. It was true. They had been there before. It was the advantage they had over England. I was quietly confident going into the game, but there are moments in sport that change the headlines, and can change history. When Sam was penalised with a few minutes to go, and England had the chance to equalise, you could see the expression on his face. It was a harsh call, in my opinion, but you could see Sam was absolutely devastated. It’s one of those areas as a seven where it’s your job to steal the ball. It’s a 50/50 call. Do you just let England have an easy quick ball and don’t give a penalty away or do you go for it? Sam would have been as hard on himself as anyone if Chris Robshaw had opted for that penalty to make it 28­28. There may have been hard headlines the other way. But I think if they’d drawn the game, Sam and Wales would have come away as heroes anyway, because of the adversity they had in terms of injuries and the way they fought back. That’s the fine margins of sport. Sam’s got away with one and Chris Robshaw hasn’t. They both gambled, they both went all in and fortunately for Wales and Sam, Sam came out with a full house. England’s bad luck Sunday will probably have been as low as Chris Robshaw and Stuart Lancaster have ever felt. In fairness to Robshaw, he's fronted up and taken it on the chin. It was an incredible decision, I thought, to go for the corner. I was shocked. I was doing the commentary and part of me was thinking, after all this adversity I’ll take a draw. Owen Farrell hadn’t looked like missing. I thought we’d take the draw. They’d got no change out of Wales from line-outs all game. Not only did they kick to the corner, they then threw it to the front. Luke Charteris, who is the best player in the world at defending driving mauls... every one of those Welsh forwards would have been saying, please throw the ball to the front. Your eyes light up when the ball goes to the front, because you can just drive them into touch.

But not when you’ve got the Welsh pack set up the way they were. It was a contradiction by Robshaw. He went all in and gambled with the kick, but if you’re going to do that you don’t then go safe and go to the front. Whoever called that call would have been lying in bed on Saturday night and wondering why. They wouldn’t have got much sleep. None of those players, win or lose, would have slept on Saturday night. Ten points down at Twickenham, you know it’s going to be difficult. But Wales managed to scrape back into it and get some momentum. Momentum is so important. When it was 22-18, England were really twitching. But Wales had those two injuries and you just thought, that’s it, game over. How the hell they managed to dig so deep in those last 10 minutes and pull it off, I’ll never know. Digging deep It wasn’t one thing – it was a series of freak events that led to that win. With Sam, Gethin Jenkins, Alun Wyn­Jones, Dan Biggar and Jamie Roberts, Wales has a spine of big-time players. They do the right things at the crucial time. They made the right calls and made the right decisions, whereas England panicked. You could sense it in the stadium. When things go awry, you find extraordinary things happen. It was if they turned to each other and said: “look boys, we’ve got nothing to lose here. We’re losing everybody left, right and centre, let’s just give it a go.” And that’s what happened. They started throwing the ball about and making things happen. It was an extraordinary sequence of events. It was like a boxing match at the end, between two heavyweights. The one had been dominating, but failed to land that knockout punch, and allowed the opponent back into the fight to outwork him. This Welsh team is one of the best groups of players I’ve ever seen do that. They just dig in and hang in there. They counterpunch. They did it against Ireland this year in the Six Nations. They were getting battered but they hung on in there – and bam, Scott Williams scored. They did exactly the same thing in 2012 against England. England were on top, seemed to be cruising, and Scott Williams again ripped the ball and got under the post. On Saturday, England got 10 points in front but Biggar and then Gareth Davies delivered those counterpunches and you could see the crowd deflate. Wales wouldn’t go away. They were thinking, how do we knock them out? They should be gone by now. For Gareth to score like he did, everything changes. When they get on a roll, Wales are such a difficult team to beat. They seem to grow 10 feet tall and become invincible. There was such hype for that game on Saturday night and the way they did it... They would have been flying. The adrenaline would have been absolutely bouncing. They’d have got back to the hotel at two or three o’clock, had a recovery session and not slept. Next stop: Fiji Now they’ve got to focus on Fiji. You can’t dwell on it. You can enjoy it but now you must move on. It’s “feet ­back ­on ­the­ ground” time. It happened to us in 2007, I think. We were already looking too far ahead after we beat Japan. We were looking at South Africa in the quarter finals. We took Fiji for granted and we came unstuck. Because this team experienced what they did in 2011, they’re just so determined to go further than they did then. They feel there’s unfinished business. They’ve got such a mature group, led by Sam and the coaches. They’ll be back to work today and, thankfully for Wales, Fiji have shown how tough they are against England and Australia. That will focus the mind even more. They know they can’t take them for granted. You can see by his post­match interview just how Sam Warburton removes emotion from the game and the performance. That’s a great quality and maintains calm decisions. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: it comes down to how he has been supported all the way – by family, school, players, coaches, and the country. It all matters. Sam and the boys are national heroes in Wales at the moment, they really are. I went to a mini rugby tournament yesterday with my nine-year-old son and that’s all anybody was talking about down there. It was incredible. Mothers, fathers, they all had their Welsh shirts on. There's a real euphoria and buzz about the place. The welcome back they get at the Millennium Stadium on Thursday will be incredible. If we were playing Fiji at Elland Road or Aston Villa, a neutral venue, it might be different. I’d be slightly more concerned. But the fact it’s back at the Millennium Stadium should overcome all the injury issues the team has had, and just take them over the line. It’s tough week coming up, but for the game in the UK and for rugby union, I want England and Wales to go through. It would be brilliant for our sport. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T20:52:24.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
