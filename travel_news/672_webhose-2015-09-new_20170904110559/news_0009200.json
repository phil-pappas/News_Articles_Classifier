Share this article Share 76 shares Layer up\nYou can experience a range of temperatures when travelling, so wear layers that are easy to pull on and off, for example a soft wrap that can double up as a sarong on the beach.\nPlus it will save you some space in your suitcase.\nGo natural\nRushing to and from the airport can be a sweaty affair.\nNatural, breathable fabrics such as cashmere, linen, silk and cotton allow air and moisture to pass through. They will also feel much softer and comfortable on a long journey.\nJet-setting fashionistas such as Olivia Palermo, Laura Bailey and Eugenia Da Silva pictured at London Fashion Week always look effortlessly stylish\nVictoria Beckham pictured at Heathrow Airport never puts a foot wrong in with her distinctive runway style\nDon't forget the shades\nAs any style maven knows, a giant pair of sunglasses will be your best friend after a flight, particularly a early morning one.\nHave a pair handy for when you step off the plane, it's the only way to hide those travel-weary eyes.\nKeep organised\n'Flinging everything out of your bag in a panic to find your passport isn't a good look.

Finally, a suitcase with wheels will save you a lot of bother if trolleys are not available.\nPreparation is key\nDon't leave your packing to the night before, and then panic when you open up your suitcase in the hotel to find your beloved hair straighteners are missing, and you end up with a Monica from Friends moment.\nGetting the right luggage is essential as well as packing realistically and not taking shoes you'll never wear\nI find creating a checklist a week before the holiday is useful, which you can keep adding to in the days leading up to the flight.\nConcentrate on accessories\nThe right accessories are light and re-usable and a game changer for that little beach dress.\nTake your beach look to the club with a statement necklace or a fabulous pair of earrings.\nGo versatile\nDon't over complicate things. Simple pieces such as a white shirt can be used for a variety of occasions; wear over your bikini at the beach to protect your skin, pair it with some denim cut offs for a casual day time look or dress it up with a mini skirt in the evening.\nPack realistically\nThose sky-high heels may look tempting in the comfort of your own home but try a stroll on the beach or a romantic walk along the cobbled streets and you will soon be swapping them for your strappy sandals.\nBonnie has teamed up with BMI Regional to create her Hit the Runway in Style guide\nBONNIE'S FLIGHT CARRY-ON ESSENTIALS 1. I tend to travel in a simple, black, jersey, maxi dress. It's a versatile piece that's comfortable, looks great in the day, by the pool or dressed up for the evening with jewellery and heels.\n2. A colourful scarf, which doubles up as a blanket on the flight, a throw on the beach, as well as a sarong. And\n3. A bikini, especially when you land early and your hotel room might be not ready yet, at least you can get in a bit of extra pool time in.\nThink about what you will be doing day by day and only pack what you are going to feel comfortable wearing when you arrive.\nBONNIE'S TOP PACKING TIP\nPack like a stylist would for a photo shoot.\nThe secret is to keep your clothes on the hangers and lay them in the case with just one fold in the middle.\nWhen you arrive you can then simply lift the ready hung outfits, out of your case and place them straight into the wardrobe.\nLess time unpacking, ironing and more time to relax by the pool!\nBonnie Rakhit has collaborated with BMI Regional to create the Hit the Runway in Style guide.\nThe writer attends fashion weeks and events around the world, including in Paris and Milan which are served by the airline from Bristol.\nRead more: The Style Traveller- A Fashion Editor's style guide to the world bmi regional airlines", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1MTQ9o2", "https://www.bmiregional.com/", "http://thestyletraveller.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-29T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:15:03.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
