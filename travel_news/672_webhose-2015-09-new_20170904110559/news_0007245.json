The crash resulted in the death of 73-year-old Marissa Malin and injured six others. Afterward, Fleming felt it was his mission to try to prevent these accidents and deaths from happening to others.\n\"After the death of Marissa and the injuries caused by the lack of protective bollards (poles) at my restaurant, I began to ask why these poles were not suggested or required in new construction,\" Fleming said. \"I reached out to storefront crash expert, Rob Reiter , of StoreFrontSafety.org and Marissa's son-in-law, Victor Manalo , a local city councilman, to begin to get some kind of legislation passed.\"\nIn spite of the pain of losing his mother-in-law and critical injuries suffered by his daughter Isabel, Victor began working with Fleming and Reiter to get stricter building code requirements to provide for protective barriers to stop or slow vehicles from crashing into buildings and restaurants.\nStorefront crashes are usually caused by driver brake-accelerator error or distracted driving. As a city councilman for the City of Artesia , Manalo was able to get his city to pass Ordinance No.15-817 to establish new standards in parking lot design to protect pedestrians and businesses from storefront crashes.\nAssemblymember Quirk was prompted to introduce AB764, which provides increased awareness and encourages protective barriers in building and parking design in California . The bill was recently passed by both the California Assembly and Senate and is now awaiting Governor Jerry Brown's signature.\n\"Rob, Victor, and I are just a signature away from our goal in helping to save lives here in California . But with an average of one to two deaths and dozens of injuries each day in the U.S., there needs to be legislation like this in every state,\" said Fleming.\nLink HERE for video on AB764\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/storefront-crash-barrier-bill-on-california-governors-desk-300143863.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
