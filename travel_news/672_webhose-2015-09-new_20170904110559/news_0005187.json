Forget the well-trodden routes – we want you to veer off the beaten path and uncover the most beautiful, unusual or overlooked stops. As always, feel free to interpret the theme as broadly as you like and don’t forget to tell us where you took the shot! \nJudges \nYour work will be reviewed by Instagram photo editor Erica Campbell, New York Times contributing photographer Jared Kohler and BBC Travel contributing editor Richard Conway. The winner will join the ranks as a BBC Travel Photo nomad and the winning shot will be featured on BBC.com. \nDeadline \nSubmissions will close Monday 21 September, and finalists will be announced the week of 28 September. Our judges will name a winner at the end of the month. \nSee last month’s finalists and the winner for the theme of hot vs cold . \nExamples", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T12:24:19.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
