This announcement is based on site search activity between January and June 2015 .\nTo commemorate this occasion, Autotrader collaborated with artist Natalie Dee and SUPER BLACK® Lacquers to develop a limited run of Autotrader TM Black nail polish, a metallic black color based upon the 2015 most-searched black cars, including the 2015 Ford F-150, 2015 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and 2015 Jeep Wrangler.\n\"We found that one in four new cars searched on Autotrader were black, and it's no surprise,\" said Tara Trompeter , managing editor at Autotrader. \"This metallic black we're seeing dominate the roads mimics the glam we expect to see coming down the runway. The automotive industry is back, and people are more likely to buy cars that reflect their personalities, the same way they do with fashion and accessories. And everyone knows it doesn't get more classic than black.\"\nColor, as it turns out, can make or break a sale. More than three-quarters of Autotrader shoppers surveyed would delay purchase if the vehicle they wanted was not available in the color they wanted.\n\"The slick, shiny nature of well-executed black paint can lend a classy or upscale vibe even to less expensive cars,\" said Brian Moody , executive editor at Autotrader. \"Bold colors like black are often popular because they're timeless – think little black dress or the enduring style of a black tuxedo. Unlike black, white or silver, bright colors or colors tied to current trends tend to look dated sooner. In the 1990s various shades of aqua and purple were popular for a short period, but those temporarily popular colors seemed inextricably tied to the era – that can sometimes lead to lower resale value as fewer used car shoppers are looking for bright colors like orange and yellow. Colors like black can keep even an older, well maintained used car looking contemporary given that the color is not tied to any one period of time and given the timelessness of black.\"\nAutotrader experts will be available during 2015 New York Fashion Week's KIA STYLE360 to discuss the results of this study, and credentialed media attending the show are encouraged to stop by the Autotrader Color Lounge inside Metropolitan West for an Autotrader Color of the Year Manicure Refresh. Media not attending the show can contact the Autotrader PR team for more information and to arrange interviews.\nThe full list of most popular black models on Autotrader follows:\nJune 2015 Rank\nMake\nModel\nOverall\n1\nFord\nF-150\n2\nChevrolet\nSilverado 1500\n3\nJeep\nWrangler\nNon-Luxury\n1\nChevrolet\nSilverado 1500\n2\nFord\nF-150\n3\nToyota\nTundra\nLuxury\n1\nBMW\nX5\n2\nMercedes-Benz\nS550\n3\nCadillac\nCTS\nAbout the Results\nBetween January and June 2015 , Autotrader collected vehicle search data to learn how car colors impact consumer preferences and car shopping behaviors.
