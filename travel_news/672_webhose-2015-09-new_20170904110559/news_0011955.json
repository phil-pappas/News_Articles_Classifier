To mark the occasion, VNG will offer CNG by VNG for a limited-time promotional price of 99 cents per GGE (gasoline gallon equivalent) at this location.\n\"We are very excited to be working with Circle K, a leading national convenience and fuel retailer, in bringing CNG fueling to the mainstream and support the development of NGVs in Texas and throughout the nation,\" said Robert Friedman , Chief Operating Officer of VNG. \"Our addition of this high quality location to our Houston retail CNG fueling network demonstrates the future of CNG fueling and we invite fleets and consumers in the area to experience it today.\"\nVNG's newest CNG fueling facility is part of a multi-city public access fueling station development program in major US markets to provide a convenient, safe and familiar CNG fueling experience for drivers of light duty vehicles such as pickups, vans and passenger cars.

CNG is a domestically sourced fuel and its use as a transportation fuel creates jobs and enhances the nations drive towards energy independence.\nVNG's facilities offer fast fill times for quick in and out plus all of the amenities drivers seek when purchasing fuel, including convenience stores, fast food options, and clean rest rooms. Added Mr. Friedman, \"Our joint effort with Circle K is a great example of the VNG offering. Together, VNG and Circle K® are offering fleets and consumers one of the most convenient, accessible and friendly CNG fueling opportunities in the industry.\"\nThe station construction project was funded in part by the State of Texas through an Alternative Fueling Facilities Program Grant from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). \"TCEQ funding for CNG infrastructure projects demonstrates the commitment by Texas to grow the use of CNG as a mainstream transportation fuel,\" stated Mr. Friedman.\nAbout Circle K\nFor more than 50 years, Circle K has been one of North America's most popular and successful operators of fuel and convenience stores.
