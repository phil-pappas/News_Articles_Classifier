Seasonal adjustment allows the comparing of monthly load factors to all other months. \nFor June, U.S. airlines reported seasonally-adjusted all-time monthly highs in passenger enplanements, Revenue Passenger-Miles (RPMs) and Available Seat-Miles (ASMs). Systemwide passenger enplanements in June (66.0 million) exceeded the previous record in June 2015 by 0.2 percent. Systemwide RPMs in June (74.8 billion) exceeded the previous record in June 2015 by 0.4 percent. Systemwide ASMs in June (89.9 billion) exceeded the previous record in June 2015 by 0.1 percent. These all-time highs resulted in a higher load factor in June because the growth in passenger travel exceeded the growth in airline capacity. \nThe June load factor of 83.2 was below the all-time seasonally-adjusted high of 84.5 in January 2014. Load factor is a measure of the use of aircraft capacity that compares the system use, measured in Revenue Passenger-Miles (RPMs) as a proportion of system capacity, measured in Available Seat-Miles (ASMs). \nThe seasonally-adjusted load factor rose in June after having remained stable at 82.9 in April and May. The load factor rose from May to June because passenger travel grew faster (0.4 percent increase in RPMs) than system capacity (0.1 percent increase in ASMs). \nTrends: \nSeasonally-adjusted \nSince peaking in early 2014, load factor has varied from a high of 83.8 in May 2014 to a low of 82.6 in November 2014. The June load factor (83.2) continued that pattern. June was the fourth consecutive month in which RPMs, ASMs and passenger enplanements reached seasonally-adjusted all-time highs. \nUnadjusted \nSystemwide: June load factor (86.4) was down from the all-time June high set in 2013 (87.0). The number of passengers, RPMs and ASMs all reached record highs for any June. \nDomestic: June load factor (87.4) equaled the all-time high for the month of June set in 2014. The number of passengers, RPMs and ASMs all reached record highs for any June. \nInternational: June load factor (84.4) was down from the all-time June high set in 2013 (86.9). The number of passengers, RPMs and ASMs all reached record highs for any June. \nFor the first half of 2014, January through June, load factor (82.9) was down from the all-time high set in 2014 (83.2). The number of passengers, RPMs and ASMs all reached record highs for the first six months of any year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T20:41:22.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
