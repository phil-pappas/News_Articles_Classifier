The gala evening, which took place two days ahead of 2015 RFU Rugby World Cup, gathered together the good, the bad and the ugly from world rugby, including six Cup winning captains: David Kirk, Nick Farr-Jones, Francois Pienaar, John Eales, Martin Johnson and John Smit. \nThe captains were joined by numerous other rugby greats including: Ben Kay, Ugo Monye, Paul Doran-Jones, James Hook, Tom Croft, Alex Corbisiero, Dorian West, Matt Poole and many more. The evening, organised by Smart Group Ltd, was compered by legendary England international Martin Bayfield who, in addition to extracting all manner of predictions, antics, insights and anecdotes from captains and guests alike, conducted a raucous charity auction chock-full of unique prizes. From a four-ball tournament with Mark Cueto, Kyran Bracken, Neil Back and Hugo Southwell to exclusive hospitality tickets at the England v Australia match, the 1,334 strong crowd dug deep into their pockets to raise a staggering amount. The evening also included a rousing performance from RFU mezzo soprano Laura Wright of ‘Swing Lo, Sweet Chariot’ as guests took their seats to a dinner especially created for the occasion by Michelin-starred chef, Angela Hartnett. Smart Group can also confirm that the Rugby Captains Dinner 2016 will take place on 2nd November 2016.
