(AP) -- Police ticketed a man with trespassing after they say he walked onto a jet way where an unoccupied plane was parked at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport. Port Authority Police spokesman Joe Pentangelo says it happened around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday at United Airlines Gate 74 in Terminal C. Pentangelo says 30-year-old Michael DeMarco of West Springfield, Massachusetts, passed through an alarmed door and walked onto the jet way. Police say DeMarco said he had been drinking. Pentangelo says DeMarco was a ticketed passenger who had arrived on a flight from Hartford, Connecticut, around 2 p.m. and missed his connection to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which left at 8 p.m. DeMarco was released early Thursday. It's not known if he continued on to Florida. The aircraft was checked and deemed safe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:12:08.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
