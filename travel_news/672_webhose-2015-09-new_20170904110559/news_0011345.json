To mark the historic event, various MAB staff, including its senior management, held a special walkabout at KL International Airport (KLIA) from 31 August through 1 September to meet and greet passengers on its flights arriving and departing from KLIA to bid adieu to Malaysian Airline System Berhad (MAS) and mark the beginning of the new national carrier.\nThe historic event saw CEO Christoph Mueller at the walkabout alongside senior management team and volunteers visiting the staff and the passengers alike.\nChristoph said, “We are very excited to welcome today, the start of our new company. We have been working hard for the past months to ensure a smooth and successful transition and we would like to thank our customers and airline partners for their continued support during this period.”\n“As we celebrate the first of September as the national icon, we look forward to enhancing the inflight experience of our customers and embodying the reason to travel on us, which is to visit Malaysia.” he added.\nThe management team handed out teddy bears to passengers with one lucky winner on MAS’ flight bound to Melbourne, MH149, a pair of Business Class tickets. The rest of the tokens were presented to passengers on MAB’s first few flight on 1 September in KLIA including MH433 from Hong Kong and MH2605 from Kota Kinabalu.\nChristoph was also seen sending off one of MAB’s first few domestic flights, MH1138 from Kuala Lumpur, which departed to Penang at 9.15am from Gate A2.\nMeanwhile, the airline today recorded a 89.8% on-time performance (OTP) on MAB’s first operational day.
