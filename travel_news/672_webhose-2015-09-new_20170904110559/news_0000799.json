As lighting, daylight and temperature control requirements change through the course of the day and night, Lutron’s flexible lighting control systems automatically optimize the environment, enhance the guest experience and save energy.\nmyRoom saves energy, reduces operating costs and increases guest satisfaction and loyalty by offering a high degree of personal control over the guest room environment. Through the options of myRoom prime and myRoom plus, the solution is available for any type of hotel room as a standalone solution or integrated into a broader hotel management system.\nIn addition, Lutron solutions utilize guest presence detection to save energy** by turning lights off when a room is unoccupied or initiatingHVAC (heating, ventilation, air conditioning) setbacks when a room is unsold. This ‘occupancy-based temperature setback’ can save 10-30% of HVAC energy in hotel guest rooms and so make a significant contribution to sustainable hospitality.\nMr. Shadi Kharouf, Lutron Sales Director for Middle East, Turkey and Central Asia, said: “With hundreds of new hotels and thousands of rooms under construction in the Middle East, this means risingenergy consumption within the rapidly expanding hospitality sector in the GCC. Energy consumption in hotels is typically broken down into lighting (30%) and AC (40%) in the Middle East; with room management systems linked to the new myRoom guestroom solution, Lutron can help hotels significantly reduce their energy consumption and cost.”\nAccording to the STR Global Construction Pipeline Report for July 2015, there are 693 hotels totalling 176,612 rooms Under Contract in the Middle East/Africa, making the region an attractive market opportunity.\nLutron already works with most of the major hotel groups in the key hospitality markets around the world, including the GCC. Lutron is already providing lighting control and window shade systems solutions to some of the leading hotel properties in the region, including the Rosewood Abu Dhabi; The Ritz-Carlton Abu Dhabi; Four Seasons Resort Dubai; The Palace Downtown Dubai; Four Seasons Hotel Doha; and The Regent Doha.\n“Lutron already has a strong pipeline for the myRoom solutions with several thousand guest rooms planned for the Middle East, over the next 18-24 months,” added Shadi Kharouf. “This reflects the regional market, where guestroom management systems are the norm (rather than the exception, as it is in most other regions, including Europe) and recognizes the merits of a solution that can guarantee a saving of 30-40% in guestroom energy consumption, whilst enhancing customer satisfaction.”\n**Occupancy-based temperature setback can save 10-30% of HVAC energy in hotel guest rooms. Actual savings may vary depending on HVAC system and control types, timeout periods, and occupant usage among other factors. GP Sullivan and J Blanchard. 2012.
