Tschumi has always been interested in concept and experience. In fact, long before his first completed project, the contemporary of Zaha Hadid and Rem Koolhaas was already widely known for his theoretical drawings and written texts, like The Manhattan Transcripts developed in the late 1970s, in which he transcribed aspects normally removed from conventional architectural representation, like the complex relationship between spaces and their use. He believed that there was no architecture without events, actions or activity. This has remained central to his work, where architecture must originate from ideas and concepts before becoming form, and cannot be dissociated from the events and movements of the living beings that inhabit it. His buildings respond to and intensify the activities that occur within them, and the combination of spaces, movements and events change and creatively extend the structures that contain them. He relates, “I would like people in general, and not only architects, to understand that architecture is not only what it looks like, but also what happens in it.”[caption id=\"attachment_1581\" align=\"\" width=\"1495\"] A folly at the Parc de la Villette in Paris (Photo JM Monthiers)[/caption]Winning the international competition in 1983 to build the Parc de la Villette, Tschumi’s idea for the new unprecedented social and cultural park was based on activity instead of nature, where its many buildings, gardens, bridges and fields served as the staging ground for concerts, exhibitions, sporting events and more. “I never looked at it as a path to success,” he says. “I was really more interested in the making of architecture. I like to Quote: Orson Welles the filmmaker, who once said, ‘I don’t enjoy cinema, I enjoy making cinema.’ Most of my work has been involved with questioning what architecture really is. I started by integrating the idea of movement and events in the definition of architecture. Many of my early projects were first shown in art galleries. I then decided to test these ideas in a real competition, my first. Unexpectedly, I won. And as they say, ‘The rest is history.’”Not just another architectural work, Tschumi’s first commission introduced the notion of deconstruction to architecture. Constructed on the site of the Parisian slaughterhouses and a national wholesale meat market, the large-scale Parc de la Villette in the northeastern edge of Paris (housing one of the largest concentration of cultural venues in the capital, including the Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie, Europe ’s largest science museum, a music museum, equestrian center, three major concert venues, performance halls, theaters, the prestigious Paris Conservatory, themed gardens and children’s playgrounds) was a major project of the French government and a testing ground for a new philosophy and approach to architecture. 35 iconic bright red follies – giant twisting, intersecting structures that are at once industrial and sculptural and act as architectural representations of deconstruction – give organization to the park, helping people navigate throughout the space. Attracting eight million visitors per year today, it is a phenomenal success and has become a neighborhood in and of itself – a welcome respite from the medieval streets of Paris.[caption id=\"attachment_1596\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Limoges Concert Hall in Limoges, France (Photo Christian Richters)[/caption]Tschumi describes the most challenging undertakings his career, “Most projects are quite challenging, but one that I would single out is, of course, the Parc de la Villette. It was my first and I knew absolutely nothing about building codes, construction phases, the role of consultants, etc. I had to learn everything in an incredibly short period of time. The other project was the new Acropolis Museum. By then I was far more experienced and knew exactly what had to be done both in conceptual and material terms. It’s probably the project where I spent the most time on the construction site, developing mock-ups and prototypes for almost every piece of the building.”A recent project, the renovation and redesign of the Paris Zoo, which reopened last April after being closed for five years, emphasized the natural habitat to better advance the zoo’s pedagogical and ecological agenda. Using techniques of immersion, visibility and camouflage to address the comfort of the animals and to create a strong sensual and emotional visitor experience, the design team’s priority was to create specific mediums to hide, complement or blend the buildings into a natural setting and went beyond the mere decoration and mimicry of nature. Tschumi discloses that the biggest challenge was “trying to design simultaneously for people and for animals, using the same concepts and the same materials”.[caption id=\"attachment_1597\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Zoo de Vincennes in the suburbs of Paris (Photo courtesy of Bernard Tschumi Architects)[/caption]Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1944, Tschumi is the son of the well-known architect, Jean Tschumi. The US permanent resident with both French and Swiss citizenship notes, “My father was born in Switzerland, but studied architecture in Paris. My mother was French and introduced me to literature and film. My father used to take me to construction sites on Sunday afternoons, but I first got really interested in literature and philosophy before I decided to become an architect while visiting Chicago at age 17.” As such, he often references other disciplines in his work, such as literature, film, art and philosophy, proving that architecture must participate in culture’s polemics and question its foundations. “People certainly wouldn’t think I’m a typical architect, nor would I want to be,” he admits. “Early sources of inspiration were filmmaking and literary studies. I was very interested in the art scene and that is one of the reasons I came to New York.”A graduate of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, he established his firm in Paris in 1983 with the commission for the Parc de la Villette, then opened his headquarters, Bernard Tschumi Architects, in New York in 1988, working for institutional, private and civic clients on everything from small facilities to large-scale master plans in Beijing, Shenzhen, New York, Montreal, Chartres, Lausanne and Santo Domingo. A leading thinker in contemporary architecture, as the dean of the Graduate School of Architecture at Columbia University from 1988 to 2003, he introduced the Paperless Studio – the first platform for education in digital architecture – and continues to teach there. His office in New York has approximately 20 people, and in Paris he has a 10-person team. He describes how he splits his time between the two cities, “I often fantasize that it’s one single office simply with the Atlantic Ocean in the middle. These days, I alternate two weeks in New York and one week in Europe throughout the year, crossing the Atlantic 25 or 30 times a year.”[caption id=\"attachment_1598\" align=\"\" width=\"1293\"] Swiss-French architect Bernard Tschumi (Photo Martin Mai)[/caption]Having exhibited widely in solo shows at museums and art galleries in the US and Europe, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Venice Architecture Biennale and recently at the Centre Pompidou in Paris – his first major European retrospective – Tschumi has received numerous awards like the rank of Officer in both the French Légion d’Honneur and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and is also an international fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in England. He describes his work method, “I wish I could say that the working process is different every time. It’s almost true but, in reality, I generally start in a very objective and analytical manner, studying all the constraints until I clearly know what I’m facing. But very often during this objective phase, intuition may strike. I feel intuition is a shortcut of reason. It just allows you to go faster.”With the Hague Passage and Hotel in the Netherlands, the Anima cultural center in Italy, a philharmonic hall for Le Rosey and an expansion of the Vacheron Constantin headquarters – both near Geneva – recently completed, Tschumi expresses his hopes for the future of architecture, “I’m very optimistic about the future of architecture because I think nobody else can really think like architects do: combining the most abstract and the most material, being able to deal with extremely complex constraints while having to arrive at a precise and articulate response. Architecture has a long way to go and will always carry excitement for future generations.”[caption id=\"attachment_1599\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Acropolis Museum in Athens (Photo Iwan Baan)[/caption] Key Designs 1) Parc de la Villette in Paris (1998) – Designed and built over a period of 15 years, the 125-acre cultural park composed of over 25 buildings, promenades, covered walkways, bridges, landscaped gardens and red enameled steel follies that support different cultural and leisure activities is based on “culture” rather than “nature” . 2) Zoo de Vincennes in the suburbs of Paris (2014) – Situated in the historical Parc de Vincennes, the reconstruction of the 15-ha zoo – housing animals from French-speaking territories divided into five different biozones – focused on preserving its important conservationist heritage while creating a new mode of animal presentation and educational experience.[caption id=\"attachment_1600\" align=\"\" width=\"900\"] Vacheron Constantin Headquarters in Geneva (Photo courtesy of Bernard Tschumi Architects)[/caption] 3) Acropolis Museum in Athens (2009) – Housing the most dramatic sculptures of Greek antiquity, the building is located at the foot of the Acropolis. The circulation route takes the visitor through different historical archaeological periods via a three-dimensional loop that extends from the archaeological excavations, visible through a glass floor, to the Parthenon Frieze in a gallery with city views, and back down through the Roman period.4) Vacheron Constantin Headquarters in Geneva (2005) – The exterior of the manufacturing and administrative headquarters of Switzerland’s oldest watchmaking company showcases a continuous monolithic metal cladding that lends the building a visual and functional coherence, which contrasts with a glass atrium containing circulation elements – walkways, stairs and an elevator – also made from glass.[caption id=\"attachment_1601\" align=\"\" width=\"1454\"] Alésia Archeological Center and Museum in Alésia, France (Photo Christian Richters)[/caption]5) Le Fresnoy National Studio for Contemporary Art in Tourcoing, France (1997) – A center for crossover artists, such as a video artist who is also a musician or a musician who is a painter, the site holds buildings from a 1920’s leisure complex, supplemented by newly-designed ones, including exhibition spaces, sound studios, production facilities, a library, cinema, restaurant and apartments for faculty and students.6) Limoges Concert Hall in Limoges, France (2007) – In a wooded area on the outskirts of a small city in central France, the 8,000-seat concert hall features a double envelope with circulation in between – an outer skin made of wood arcs and translucent rigid polycarbonate sheets and an inner acoustical envelope of locally-grown Douglas fir – which is advantageous for both acoustical and thermal reasons.[caption id=\"attachment_1602\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Blue in New York City (Photo courtesy of Bernard Tschumi Architects)[/caption]7) Alésia Archeological Center and Museum in Alésia, France (2012) – Located on an archaeological site in central France that commemorates the battle between Julius Caesar and the Gauls in 52 B.C., the scheme consists of a museum built of stone recreating battlements and earthworks at the top of the hill above the town and an interpretive center made of wood in the fields below, both blending into the landscape and representative of the confrontation between the Romans and the Gauls.8) Blue in New York City (2007) – The 17-storey residential tower with 32 apartments in the Lower East Side succeeds in creating an original architectural statement while responding to the constraints of the city’s zoning code and the developer’s commercial requirements. Its blue pixelated envelope is distinctive yet blends into the sky, and the upper-floor units have stunning views of Lower Manhattan from river to river.", "external_links": ["http://tschumi.com/"], "published": "2015-09-08T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T19:30:37.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
