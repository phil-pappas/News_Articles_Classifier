Setting sail from historic Portsmouth in May, she will visit exciting destinations in Britain and Northern Europe before heading to the enchanting Mediterranean.\nA visit to Funchal’s hillside Botanical Gardens, with its collection of 2,500 plants, is sure to be a treat if you choose to ‘Escape to Madeira & The Azores’, and Claude Monet’s garden in Giverny, which inspired many of his paintings, is not to be missed if you join our ‘Essence of Voyager, Jersey & France’ cruise.\nThe Neolithic Callanish Stones – one of the most complete ancient stone circles in Europe – can be discovered as Voyager calls at Lewis, one of ‘Britain’s Beautiful Isles’, while dramatic landscapes take centre stage in our ‘Viking Lands & Icelandic Explorer’ cruise. The Blue Lagoon, a geothermal spa retreat set amidst stunning mountain scenery, is among the treasures that await.\nMake sure you’re on deck as Voyager sails into Valletta’s impressive Grand Harbour before taking time to explore the Maltese capital in the ‘Enchanting Mediterranean’ , or choose to soak up a host of ‘Dalmation, Venetian & Greek Wonders’, such as Venice’s iconic Rialto Bridge which spans the Grand Canal.\nTurkey and Greece offer awe-inspiring sights aplenty, with Istanbul’s Blue Mosque, a masterpiece of Ottoman architecture, and the UNESCO-listed Meteora Monasteries, perched atop soaring sandstone peaks, two of the outstanding options on our ‘Greek & Turkish Delight’ and ‘Tales of Turkey & Grecian Escapade’ cruises respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T04:46:11.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
