To enable the transmission's stop/start functionality, BorgWarner's Eco-Launch hydraulic accumulator and solenoid valve provide rapid, quiet and smooth engagements during engine restarts. BorgWarner's advanced friction plate technology reduces drag and enhances shift feel. Improving fuel economy up to 5 percent compared with similar 6-speed automatic transmissions, the 8L45 transmission will debut on the 2016 Cadillac CT6 and will also drive the 2016 Cadillac CTS and ATS.\n\"BorgWarner's leading transmission technologies deliver seamless shifts and smooth launches with the added benefit of improved fuel economy,\" said Robin Kendrick , President and General Manager, BorgWarner Transmission Systems. \"Collaborating with GM on our latest friction plate solutions and ground-breaking innovations, such as our Eco-Launch stop/start accumulator, puts new technology on the road quickly. We are pleased to support GM in introducing another important transmission technology to the market.\"\nStop/start systems increase fuel economy by turning the engine off when the vehicle stops. For quick acceleration from the stop mode, BorgWarner's accumulator and Eco-Launch solenoid valve quickly re-prime the transmission in less than 0.3 seconds, the time it takes the driver to switch from the brake to the accelerator. The exceptionally low-noise, high-flow, low-leak solenoid valve opens against large accumulator pressures and stays closed against high line pressures. The technology earned BorgWarner an Automotive News PACE Innovation Partnership Award for its collaboration with GM as well as a 2014 Automotive News PACE Award.\nBorgWarner's multi-segment wet friction plate technology features full-depth grooves cut between segments of proprietary friction material. The groove patterns and material are engineered for each specific application to optimize the clutch for low drag which improves fuel economy, provides seamless shifts for better performance and delivers durability that exceeds the life of the transmission. Utilizing advanced processing capabilities and intricate groove designs, BorgWarner's latest friction plate technology is proving successful under a widening range of operating conditions and offers the same benefits in torque converter applications. This technology was first introduced on GM's Hydra-Matic 8L90 in the 2015 Corvette Stingray and Z06, and will now be featured in the new 8L45 automatic transmission for various platforms.\nBorgWarner produces its multi-segment wet friction plates in Bellwood, Illinois , and its accumulator and Eco-Launch solenoid valves in Water Valley, Mississippi . To meet growing demand, BorgWarner is investing in both plants to improve efficiency and expand capacity.\nAbout BorgWarner\nBorgWarner Inc. (NYSE: BWA) is a product leader in highly engineered components and systems for powertrains around the world. Operating manufacturing and technical facilities in 57 locations in 18 countries, the company delivers innovative powertrain solutions to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and enhance performance.
