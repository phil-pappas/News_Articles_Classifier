After working for a major US airline for the past 16 years, I know this all too well. And perhaps my favourite thing about welcoming new colleagues is how they take me fondly back to my own newbie experience, which was full of highs and lows. \nThe excitement and the nerves. Truly learning how utterly strange humans are. The fun of being the new guy or girl on the block. \nSo when I spotted a newbie (who wishes to remain anonymous) on a recent flight, I sat them down to chat about their early impressions of the job. Here are some of their confessions and observations that ring so very true to me. \nOne month into the job: \n1. The passenger who starts a sentence with, “I don’t want to be any trouble but…”, will be more trouble than you could possibly want. \n2. The more passengers with tight connections, the higher likelihood that we will be delayed. \n3. Eating a full breakfast at 3.30am now seems perfectly normal. As does eating 2 Minute Noodles for dinner at 1am — sometimes on the same day! \n4. I now know that the only thing dirtier than an aeroplane toilet is the tray table, and a hotel TV remote control (by the way, shower caps make perfect remote covers). \n5. The length of my layover will be inversely proportionate to the amount of cool things to do at that particular location. \n6. It’s possible to completely fill a sick bag. It’s also possible to hide it in a seat back pocket. Watch out too, for ‘chain reaction’ vomiters! \n7. Because parents are comfortable with their own children’s bodily waste, they expect you to be and will try to hand you full nappies (sorry, but poo is poo, people, I don’t care how cute your baby is). Yep, people really are this messy. And yes, those are nappies. Picture: Passenger Shaming Source: \n8. Parents who realise that the above is unsanitary, sometimes think they are helping by placing it in the ‘pit of despair’, also known as the seat back pocket. Said child will be crying inconsolably and seated behind the grumpiest old man on the plane. \n9. The ‘low talker — the person you have to get close to in order to hear — is inevitably the person with the most unfortunate breath on-board. \n10. The flight attendant leader/purser who starts a sentence with, “I’m really easygoing …” could teach many world leaders about tyranny. \n11. You never know what’s going on in someone’s life, so I give everyone a little leeway. \n12. You’ll work with a ‘Chatty Cathy’ who talks so much you think they must have another place that they breathe out of! \n13. Airport gate agents generally love to hate us. \n14. I wish I had a dollar for every time I’ve been told, “Well, it fit on the last plane …” Are you or someone you know guilty of #CarryOnShame ?

When someone seems intent on sucking the soul out of you, smile at them ‘til it hurts. It drives them crazy. \n16. Passengers can be sweethearts one minute, and like Darth Vader with a hangover the next. All they need is a trigger i.e. being told to put laptops away, no upgrade/blankets/pillows. But do something nice for them, and they are putty in your hands. \nFour months into the job: \n1. I absolutely love giving out wing pins to kids! I think I get more excited than they do.

The best question I’ve been asked so far was from a woman looking out at the blanket of clouds below us, who rang her call button to ask if we’d be late. Why? “See for yourself, we are barely moving,” she said. \n3. If you miss latching a galley compartment and something falls out on takeoff, it will be the loudest thing you’ve ever heard. However, handily, it does alert you to where the nervous flyers are seated due to the extreme level of their reaction. \n4. Apparently, working out how to operate the plug in the bathroom sink requires the user to be a NASA engineer, as no-one seems to manage it. \n5. I’ve discovered that sometimes when colleagues talk at length about their ‘children’, they may in fact be referring to their pets. I now find this completely normal. \n6. After lots of time spent on-board different aircraft, I’m now able to look at a bag and tell passengers exactly where it will fit (no, not like that!). I believe my ability to get carry-ons to fit may actually be my superpower. \n7. The amount of complicated drink orders you receive is inversely proportional to the length of the flight e.g. a 45 minute flight will go something like this: “Gimme a Sprite mixed with OJ, plus a splash of Cranapple and a lemon”. \n8. This same flight will also have a large number of ‘Anna’s’ (“I’ll have a coffee ‘anna’ water ‘anna’ orange juice” etc.). \nThat’s a healthy dose of lessons for four months on the job. And I’m very happy to hear their conclusion: \n“I still think it’s the most fun, entertaining, varied and unbeatable job I’ve ever done and I get to work with some amazing characters, whom I otherwise would never have met, and travelled to ‘back-of-beyond’ places that I had to look up on a map. And yes, I plan on doing this until they pry the cart from my cold, dead fingers.” \n… And that’s how I know they are truly “one of us.” Welcome aboard, friend. \nThis story originally appeared on FlyerTalk .
