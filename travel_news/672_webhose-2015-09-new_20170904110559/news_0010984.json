The casual eatery will serve a varied menu of internationally influenced but unpretentious dishes such a whole roast cauliflower with tahini and pomegranate, Za’atar fried chicken and Tel Aviv salad with fresh tomatoes, herbs and lemon; there’ll be a small selection of craft beers and cocktails on offer for those who just want a quick snack and drink. Kudos to the team, too, for making a proactive effort to integrate with the local community. Staff are collaborating with Magic Breakfast (which provides free, nutritious breakfasts to schools where a significant percentage of pupils are eligible for free meals) to cook meals and run demonstrations and workshops in East London. Across the road from its sister restaurant Donostia, Lurra stands in Marylebone ’s Seymour Place and will serve traditional Basque cuisine. The menu will primarily offer large sharing places, with the restaurant’s signature dish whole grilled turbot cooked over wood in a fish basket – the dish is inspired by cooking methods at San Sebastian’s Restaurante Elkano. Other dishes on the fish-heavy menu include cod tongues cooked three ways, and sea bream cooked over charcoal. And when warmer months again approach there should be a second surge of interest in the premises – the rear of the building accommodates a private courtyard that holds 20 diners and should prove popular in the summer months. Turbot in fish basket at Lurra Another Marylebone opening, Bernardi ’s is a modern Italian restaurant occupying two floors of a restored Victorian property in Portman Village. Run by brothers Gabriel and Marcello Bernardi, it will serve a “simple and seasonal” menu including dishes such as white peaches with burrata, almonds and basil or tarragon gnocchi with rabbit ragu and pancetta. Expect to pay about £16 to £19 for mains. Brunch will also be on offer over weekends and “vintage-inspired” Italian-style cocktails will be served at the bar. • The best hotels in central London Piccadilly's Hotel Café Royal this month launches its London Royal Tea . Though every notable hotel in the city offers its own take on this culinary tradition – the most impressive among them already feature in our guide to London’s best afternoon teas – Café Royal is hoping its offering will prove distinctive enough to make a mark. All its components are supposedly inspired by the capital, so guests will begin their tea first with a brief talk on the history of afternoon tea and its association with the city, before eating sandwiches made with London honey, sweets inspired by Pearly kings and queens, and other themed sundries. The tea costs £42 per person, or £55 per person with champagne. When it opens on September 7, Broadway Market ’s Poco will be – its owners claim – “London’s first fully fledged 90 per cent waste-free restaurant”. Poco began in Bristol and this first London outpost will replicate some of the sustainability strategies already in action there. As with many London restaurants, produce will be seasonal, local and organic where possible, but additionally meat will be cooked from nose to tail and the 10 per cent of produce that is sourced beyond Britain’s borders will be delivered by non-air freight from Europe. Though the menu will change frequently, diners might order courgette fritters with soured raw cream, deep-fried oyster with kelp aioli or chargrilled apricots with whipped ricotta. As for the restaurant itself, environmentally favourable materials such as reclaimed timbers and clay-based paints have been used in its construction. Chocolate pot with beetroot at Poco In Belsize Park , The Truscott Cellar is a modern wine bar and restaurant overseen by Andrew and Mary Jane Fishwick. It’s their second venture after The Truscott Arms and hopes are high given the venue was named newcomer of the year in the 2015 Top 50 Gastropubs Awards. Their latest endeavour features a wine list with some 300 bottles, a menu of British small plates devised by Aidan McGee (previously of Dinner by Heston Blumenthal) and more substantial offerings such as a Billingsgate fish board. During its soft-opening period from September 7 to 10 there’ll be 50 per cent off the food menu; the restaurant opens officially on September 11. The new sibling to the longstanding Soho stalwart, Yauatcha City near Liverpool Street this month launches Supreme Saturdays. A new brunch-style menu aimed at groups, the dim sum-heavy offering features a selection of signature dishes available only at the City branch of Yauatcha, as well as established offerings such as Yauatcha’s supreme lobster roll and Venison puff. Main courses include lobster vermicelli and truffle pork belly, dessert is included and a cocktail and bottle of wine per couple round off the £49 per person deal. • The best hotels in central London Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:34:02.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
