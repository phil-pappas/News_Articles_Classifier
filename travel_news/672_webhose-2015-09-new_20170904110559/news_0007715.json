The new hotel is located in an excellent area on one of the most prominent avenues in the city of Berlin, a short distance from the major embassies and only 350 meters from KaDeWe (Kaufhaus des Westens), the most famous mall in Germany thanks to the wide variety of luxury items and gastronomy it has on offer. \n \n \nWith the opening of this four star hotel, the hotel chain will expand its line to the European continent after having consolidated Riu Plaza Panama in the Panamanian capital and Riu Plaza Guadalajara in Mexico, as well as the recent opening of the Riu Plaza Miami Beach . \n \n \nThe Hotel Riu Plaza Berlin characterized by a modern façade and 17 floors, offers 357 rooms , including doubles and suites which combine elegant and contemporary interior decorating with all types of amenities: Internet, flat-screen TV, kettle, minibar and safe-deposit box, among others. In terms of gastronomy, the RIU Plaza Berlin will offer a buffet breakfast, while the à la carte restaurant will open for lunch and dinner. In addition, next to reception is the lobby bar, a takeaway snack area which will be open 24 hours a day. \n \n \nWith respect to business tourism, the Riu Plaza Berlin offers six conference and meeting rooms with the capacity to hold a total of 840 people , ideal for conventions and events. These spaces, which combine style and functionality, will be flexible and capable of adapting to each client’s needs. All of these features will be accompanied by the service for which RIU is known and wireless high-speed Internet access in the rooms and the hotel’s common areas. \n \n \nThe city of Berlin, Germany’s capital, is one of the most influential cities politically in the European Union. Today, Berlin is a modern city, characterized by its wide avenues, its Prussian style palaces, its museums and its vibrant cultural life, making it a captivating city for the tourists who visit year after year. \n \n \nThe Riu Plaza Berlin won’t be the only opening in the RIU Plaza line in 2015. At the end of the year, the Spanish chain will open its first urban hotel in New York, the RIU Plaza New York Times Square located in the heart of Manhattan. The newly constructed hotel with 29 floors will have 647 rooms and offer a wide array of gastronomical options.
