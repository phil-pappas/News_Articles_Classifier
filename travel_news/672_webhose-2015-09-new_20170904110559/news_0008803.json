He added that he had given him a bath to refresh him and that the toddler must have drowned because he had water coming out of his nostrils.\nHowever the victim's older sister, then five, told the doctor: \"Daddy put Bastien in the washing machine because he was naughty at school.\" She maintained this version throughout the investigation, and the child's mother Charlene Cotte, 29, has said she saw Champenois put Bastien in the washing machine and turn it on.\nCotte told investigators she was doing a puzzle with her daughter and Champenois was surfing on the internet while their son screamed inside the tumbling machine. She said that when her ex-husband removed Bastien from the washing machine and noticed he was no longer breathing he said: \"At least he won't bother us anymore.\"\nA neighbour who came to the apartment to help described Bastien as \"frozen, completely naked. He was all white, limp, practically like a toy.\"\nCotte was initially charged with failing to prevent a crime, but this was changed to \"aiding and abetting murder and violence.\"\nShe again denied any complicity in the crime in court on Tuesday.\nFell Through 'All the Cracks'\nHer lawyer Gerard Zbili described her as a \"broken woman who lost the child that she loved\" but who was unable to protect him out of fear of her husband.\nSeveral child protection agencies are appearing in a civil suit in the case, which has revealed a deeply troubled family known to social services.\nIt has emerged that the golden-haired Bastien was not wanted by his father, who dealt out harsh punishments for his increasingly agitated behaviour at home and at school, such as locking him in a cupboard.\nThe failure of social workers will also be examined in the trial, as three reports of a \"child in danger\" and nine of \"worrying information\" had been filed before the murder.\n\"This is not an isolated act... it is not a fit of rage or madness, it is the final act of violence against a child who was always mistreated,\" said Isabelle Steyer, lawyer for a child protection group, who said Bastien has \"fallen through all the cracks.\"\n Washing machine death toddler killed France World Also Read Anti-xenophobia marchers gather in Johannesburg after attacks Australian jailed over 12-year-old daughter's 'marriage' Phil Rudd skips jail but faces music Canadian province keen to contribute to PM Modi's' Make in India' initiatives", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://deccan-docbase.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/washing-machine-baby.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150908/world-europe/article/french-parents-trial-toddler’s-washing-machine-death", "http://deccan-docbase.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/styles/article_node_view/s3/washing-machine-baby.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-09-09T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:06:40.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
