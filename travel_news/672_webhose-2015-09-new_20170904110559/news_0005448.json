INDABA 2016 will take place at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre in Durban from May 7 to 9, 2016.Mr Nzima says: “The annual Tourism INDABA is Africa’s biggest and best travel tradeshow, drawing exhibitors from across the continent, and offering travel buyers an unrivalled platform to do business with the cream of the African leisure tourism industry.”\nTourism INDABA 2015 attracted exhibitors from 20 destinations across Africa. As important, the level of connectivity between buyers and exhibiters showed excellent growth at 69 percent more meetings between these two critical delegate groups in 2015 than there were in 2014. In total, 29 058 business meetings took place during the three-day show between exhibitors and buyers.\nThere’s every reason to attend Tourism INDABA 2016 as a buyer. INDABA gives buyers an unrivalled opportunity to keep abreast of global trends and new developments in travel and tourism; meet industry stakeholders face to face; gain competitive advantage in the sector; and meet the sales representatives from more than 1 200 African exhibiting companies with the view to doing business with them.\nTourism INDABA exhibitors agree that they keep returning to INDABA for the excellent depth and breadth of business opportunities the tradeshow offers through buyer delegates. Says Maxwell Moyo, National Sales Manager, African Sun Zimbabwe: “We have been exhibiting at INDABA for nine years precisely because of the presence of many quality buyers from our source markets such as Europe, Germany, Italy and Spain.”\nSimilarly, the Mauritius Tourism Authority’s Amrita Craig says INDABA offers many opportunities to connect with buyers, set up meetings and maximise interest in the destination. “It’s a wonderful platform to conduct business and meet people,” she says.\n“We are investing in ensuring INDABA maintains its keen business competitive edge, providing the optimal business platform for exhibitors and buyers alike. The Diary and Matchmaking system is an integral component of this, as is attracting optimal numbers of quality buyers and exhibitors to INDABA,” adds Mr Nzima.\nSource:-Tourism INDABA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:07:35.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
