Comment melody@messengerpostmedia.com Posted Sep. 1, 2015 at 7:08 PM BUFFALO — The Buffalo Passport Agency and the U.S. Department of State are celebrating Passport Awareness Month during September by launching an “Apply Early” campaign for U.S. citizens thinking about renewing their current passports or applying for the first time. The Department is expecting an increase in passport applications through 2018, and encourages travelers to submit passport applications well ahead of their planned travel dates in order to avoid delays receiving their travel documents. Typically, applicants can receive their passports more quickly when applying between the months of September to December. Renewing an adult’s passport may be done by mail at any time if the applicant meets certain criteria. Children and adults applying for the first time must appear in person at a passport acceptance facility, including designated U.S. post offices, clerks of court and public libraries. Passport acceptance facilities offer routine service (4-6 weeks) and expedited service (3 weeks). The expedited service costs an additional $60. Applying during the off-peak months of September, October, and November can help ensure passports are processed well within the service commitments. For more information on how or where to apply, please visit Travel.State.Gov/ApplyEarly or call the National Passport Information Center toll-free at 1-877-487-2778 or 1-888-874-7793 which is Text Telephone (TTD) and Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TTY).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T04:14:48.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
