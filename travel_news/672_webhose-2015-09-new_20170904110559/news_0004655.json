The best time to visit the area is to travel by air to Leh in the middle of winter season, and undertake a difficult trek by climbing over semi frozen Zanskar River gradients and gorge, to visit the primeval Zanskari culture, which is a conventional mix of Indian and Tibetan cultures. You can also see some unique and rare wild life - snow leopard, ibex and blue sheep that can be found in many frozen areas in the vicinity. The tour is always accompanied and headed by a trained guide - it would be quite imbecilic to go on your own, as the river can be treacherous in certain areas which are not frozen solid, and people can simply disappear into the frozen undergrounds forever if they are not careful. One can experience adventure in its rawest form when one visits the Chadar Trek. \nIt is one of the toughest and most courageous of all treks in the world. The total distance one has to travel during the trek is around 105 kilometers - each way, which makes it a total of 210 kilometers. Each person undertaking the trek has to cover a distance of 15 to 17 kilometers each day, depending upon the duration of the trek and prevailing weather conditions. The most difficult part is in dealing with the sub zero temperature. It can be as cold as minus 10 degrees Celsius during the daytime, and at night, it can further drop down to minus 20 to 25 degrees Celsius. \nThe Chadar Frozen River Trek suggests an opportunity to discover the beauty of Mother Nature at her icy best. The whole region is very much inaccessible, even though a few small villages spread the locality. The Zanskar River flows right in the middle of the area, and acts as a life line for the villagers. During the winter months the frozen surface of the river acts as a path for commutation. This is important because all other routes and passes connecting the Ladakh area become inaccessible due to heavy snow falls. It is the only route available for travelling and commutation purposes. Moreover, travelers get a chance to experience the unique Ladakh culture, which is a blend of Indian as well as Tibetan cultures. You get a chance to visit the ancient monasteries which are well known for their traditional rituals and peaceful way of life.
