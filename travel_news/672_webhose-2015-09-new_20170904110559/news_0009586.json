For example, having discussions while sitting on swings hanging from the ceiling could pave way for easier conflict resolutions. Meeting sizes should also not exceed 50 pax in order to harness the creative room concept effectively, she added. \n\nAnother key feature of Experience Meetings is Brain Food, a culinary concept developed in consultation with nutrition experts and chefs to emphasise the use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients while maintaining great taste, low fat content and low added sugar. The result is food that helps delegates experience optimal concentration and minimal fatigue during meetings. \n\nAdditionally, Experience Meeting s offers free Internet access and automatically purchases carbon credits to offset the estimated carbon footprint of every event. \n\nSpeaking to TTG Asia e-Daily during the concept showcase at Radisson Blu Plaza Bangkok on September 1, the hotel’s director of catering Chomwan Paoratsamee revealed that the programme has already been put to work by “more adventurous” Thai companies like SCG Paper. \n\nNoting that Thai corporates are still more inclined to request for conventional meeting set-ups, Chomwan added: “We will actively promote Experience Meetings , especially to design companies and the more health-conscious segments.” \n\nHowever, a more enthusiastic response is expected in India where “customers are open to new concepts”, said Russell who led the showcase to New Delhi two days later. \n\nAbout 25 per cent of the business in Radisson Blu hotels in India is generated by the MICE segment, and “the country is poised for exponential growth in (this) sector”, she remarked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T11:17:05.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
