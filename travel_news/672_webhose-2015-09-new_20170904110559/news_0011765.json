She asks: I need to make a speech about my business. How do I make it a success? Business expert Rachel Bridge replies: Making a speech in front of an audience can be really nerve-racking, particularly if it is not something you are used to doing. Your first step should be to find out as much as you can beforehand about what kind of event you will be speaking at and who your audience will be, so you can make sure you will be talking about areas they want to hear about. Give your speech a structure so people get a sense of where it is heading. Organise your content so that, for example, there are ten top tips you want to share, or seven key rules that you have learnt while building your business. There is no need to memorise your speech but do not simply read it out either. Condense it into notes, with key words to remind you, and either hold them in your hand or have them in your pocket. If possible, practise in front of friends and family and ask for their feedback. And try to avoid having a PowerPoint presentation. It acts as a barrier between you and your audience and stops them focusing on what you are saying as they stare at the screen instead. If you absolutely must have one, do not just stand there and read it. It should add value to your speech, not replace it. Including a (very) short video can also be a nice way to keep an audience engaged, but make sure you actually know how to make the equipment work. Find out in advance how long you are expected to speak for, and make sure you stick to the time allocated. No matter how much the audience appears to be enjoying your speech, they will still want you to end when you are supposed to. When making your speech, speak slowly. If you are nervous it can be tempting to speed up to get it over with quicker. But do not, as it will be really hard for your audience to follow what you are saying. And do not be afraid of pauses. It can be helpful to give your audience time to absorb what you have said before rushing on to the next point. Finally, be yourself, and be as natural as you can be. Presumably you have been asked to make a speech because you have something interesting to talk about, so simply tell your story in a clear concise way. And go easy on the jokes. The occasional light-hearted aside is fine but, unless you are a confident performer, jokes can often backfire or fall flat. Be particularly careful not to include anything risqué or libellous. Emma Jones is the founder of the small business network Enterprise Nation and makes many speeches every year. She adds: People buy into businesses often through the expertise and integrity of the people behind them. It's why speaking at events and personal engagements is so important for a brand, even at the earliest stages. Make no bones about it, people will genuinely want to hear your story. When you are preparing your story, think about why you set up your business, what drove you to do it, how it all began and what lessons you learned along the way. Consider your mission and ambitions, and what you can share with the audience in terms of top tips and practical help. Finally, it's important to be yourself or you won't feel comfortable. Be honest and authentic and pace yourself. And always remember to breathe. • Travelling to a conference to give a speech?
