Therefore, Airport Parking and Hotels (APH) is encouraging drivers to stay well-rested and hydrated when on the road by sharing updated service station facilities on some of the UK’s busiest motorways and roads.\nThe research compares the facilities available at service stations on major UK roads such as the M25, M40, A303 and A1 including hotels, restaurants, cafés and family facilities. It also highlights the fuel options available and whether charging points for electric vehicles are provided at each service station.\nOf the 16 service stations researched, 11 were found to offer on-site hotel accommodation for drivers, with a further three service stations including Fleet, Gretna and Telford also providing free parking for all hotel guests. For drivers on the road for business, Beaconsfield, Cobham and Tebay all offer the opportunity to rent meeting and conference rooms at the service stations and Cobham even offer drivers a self-service laundrette. Coffee-drinking motorists should note that Gloucester and Tebay service stations do not offer big name franchise coffee, however, six service stations offered Starbuck’s with a further seven service stations offering Costa.\nFor drivers travelling with babies and children in need of a break, six service stations offer motorists dedicated play areas for children, including Beaconsfield, Gloucester, Hopwood Park, Tebay, Telford and Wetherby. Additionally, Cardiff Gate, Fleet, Gretna, Hopwood Park and Telford service stations all offer baby facilities including dedicated baby changing stations.\nFor health-conscious parents, Gloucester and Tebay service stations also sell organic baby food and have dedicated children’s portions and lunchboxes. Furthermore Gloucester and Tebay services also offer dedicated family toilet facilities with child-size toilets and basins, as well as offering drivers an exclusive family area, which includes a microwave for warming up baby food and a dedicated childrens’ seating area.\nMotorists wanting to explore independent food options should stop at Gloucester or Tebay service stations, where the food is locally-sourced and prepared on site. Furthermore, both Tebay and Gloucester services offer drivers the opportunity to visit the on-site farm shop and butcher’s counter should they need to do any last minute shopping.\nOut of the 16 service stations researched, six offered drivers Shell fuel services and a further three offered bp. Moreover, 11 services stations including, Annandale, Thurrock and Willoughby Hedge all offer charging points for electric vehicles with two service stations, Cobham and Peterborough, further stating the charging points are free of charge to all drivers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:04:20.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
