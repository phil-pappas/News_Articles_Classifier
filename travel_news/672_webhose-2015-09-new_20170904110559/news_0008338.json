However, we are building business units that will be owned by Red Apple Group, which includes our own fleet, restaurants or even hotel management at some point,” said Goenka. \n\nFinancing for the massive growth plan will come from existing resources, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T08:02:45.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
