The Prince of Wales bought a dilapidated farmhouse in Transylvania six years ago and returned to stay two years later after converting it into a delightful guesthouse.\nIt must have seemed the complete antithesis to life back in England. Situated deep in rural Romania, the rustic hideaway has just seven rooms in three simple buildings, all furnished with traditional antiques.\nIt feels impossibly remote. The tarmac road runs out three miles away and it has no TV, mobile phone coverage or wi-fi.\nScroll down for video\nThe lodgings are in rural Romania, far removed from the technological world we now live in\nWith the Prince’s passion for the environment I could see why he chose the location. Farmers scythe fields by hand and horses and carts trundle along the lanes, piled high with fresh hay. Meadows around the village are smothered in wild flowers and within minutes my guide had picked me a bouquet of 50 different species.\nI felt I had stepped into a Thomas Hardy novel. I collected wild strawberries from the hedgerows and visited shepherds who live up in the high pastures for months on end, sleeping in airless wooden boxes and making cheese in tumbledown shacks. I tried some made hours earlier. It was the most delicious I had ever tasted.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Discover an alien land... only two hours from Weatherfield!...

We drank Romanian wine from the vineyard of Count Kalnoky, who manages the property for the Prince.\nThe Prince of Wales bought the dilapidated farmhouse in Transylvania six years ago\nBears roam the hills and I would sit for ages on my doorstep, eyes glued to binoculars, hoping to glimpse one.\nOne evening the Count led me to a hide in the birch forest, plying me with his home-made plum brandy, as we waited in vain for one to show himself.\nLife in rural Romania has changed little over the centuries.\nAt the sister property in Miklosvar, a 40-minute drive away, I watched the evening ritual of the village herd coming back from pasture, each cow turning off to its own home for the night. On top of the one-storey houses, storks had built nests resembling gigantic wicker baskets balanced on the chimney pots.\nThe smithy still operates and Gyorgy, the smith, demonstrated how to beat the red-hot iron over an anvil, producing a tiny serpent for me. In a nearby village, 77-year-old Etelka worked at her home-made loom, weaving napkins used as ‘lunch boxes’ by local farmers.\nA couple of hours further west is the medieval walled city of Sighisoara. Pretty painted Saxon houses with ornately carved windows surround the main square beside an ochre-coloured corner building – the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler, better known as Dracula. Crowds congregated to visit the room where he was born.\nI preferred to explore the narrow lanes leading up to the ramparts with their wood-shingle roofs, stopping for tea in a shady geranium-filled garden.\nOn my last morning, still on my quest for bears, I visited Libearty, the largest sanctuary in Europe. Here, in vast enclosures spanning a 160-acre wilderness, 80 or so rescued animals can roam at will.\nMax, one of the older bears, touched me most. Leading a solitary life in his own pen, he stared at me with bloodshot vacant eyes. For years he had been shackled to railings as a tourist attraction and had been blinded and drugged with beer and sleeping tablets. Now at last he can live out his days in peace.\nTAKE A TRIP TO TRANSYLVANIA Original Travel ( originaltravel.co.uk , 020 7978 7333) has a nine-day trip to Transylvania from £1,575pp. It includes two nights at Miklosvar, two at Zalanpatak, a night in Bucharest and one night in Sighisoara, return flights, transfers and some activities.\nFor details of Libearty visit bearsanctuary.com .\nRead more: Home | The Bear Sanctuary Luxury Holidays - Tailor Made Holidays - Original Travel", "external_links": ["http://bearsanctuary.com/", "http://originaltravel.co.uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1X0aDAf", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-30T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:24:11.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
