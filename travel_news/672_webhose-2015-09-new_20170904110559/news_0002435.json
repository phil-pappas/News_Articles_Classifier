The league was originally formed as a home for some of the nation's premier mid-major basketball teams and it wasn't until a number of changes and the demand for a higher national profile that the league began sponsoring football in 2001. Because of this decision to move the league in to the group of football playing conferences, the Sun Belt Conference has a permanent seat on the NCAA's 18-member Board of Directors. As a result, the conference has a crucial voice on some of the most pressing issues in college athletics.\nThe Sun Belt Conference's membership consists of 11 football members for 2014 - Appalachian State , Arkansas State , Georgia Southern , Georgia State , Idaho , UL Lafayette, UL Monroe, New Mexico State , South Alabama , Texas State and Troy. UALR and UT Arlington compete in all-sports as non-football members while Idaho and New Mexico State are football only members.\nFor more information on the Sun Belt Conference, visit www.sunbeltsports.org .\nÂ©2015 PR Newswire.
