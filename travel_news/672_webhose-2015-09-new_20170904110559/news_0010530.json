The Green Globe award is proof of the strong commitment of these jewels in the Oetker Collection to protecting and preserving the environment. \nOnce a 12th century Knights Templar castle, the elegant and prestigious Chateau Saint-Martin & Spa is set in a 32-acre estate, where the mountains meet the scenic Côte d’Azur (French Riviera). In more recent times, the property has been transformed into a luxury five star hotel with a commitment to raising awareness about conservation issues within the community. \nThe CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) department, created in 2011 and managed by Julie Poirot, CSR coordinator, is behind numerous projects initiated every year. The CSR department at Chateau Saint Martin and spa attaches great importance to making the hotel an eco-responsible establishment that takes great care of the surrounding environment. Several beehives adorn the property providing organic honey for guests’ tables as well as protecting local biodiversity. In addition, interactive educational programs for children highlight the beauty of nature and the importance of environmental responsibility. \nVarious forms of action have been set in place such as the use of hybrid cars by guests to reduce carbon emissions and the use of fossil fuels. Also, many staff members are actively involved in associations like JMAH (Jeunesse Missionnaire d’Aide Humanitaire), a humanitarian project in the Congo offering medical aid services strongly supported by the Oetker Collection. \nAt Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, the construction of an “insect hotel” offers shelter to a whole host of insect species. The natural environment of the grounds deteriorates over winter, reducing the number of spaces suitable for insects, particularly during hibernation. This luxury shelter houses and protects invertebrate friends; some of them use it to build their nests, while others see it as a temporary refuge. \nThe “hotel” is home to beetles and ladybirds, and also solitary bees or butterflies and even earwigs. Each species has its own dedicated area comprised of drilled logs, wood shavings, branches or moss. The “insect hotel” helps to enrich the micro fauna at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc while educating young guests about protecting the environment. \nMore information here: www.oetkercollection.com \nAbout The Oetker Collection \nOetker Collection is one of the most inspiring selections of masterpiece hotels in the world. \nThe name “masterpiece hotels” includes a pledge; a commitment to provide service of the highest quality, every hour of every day.
