Amadeus subscribers will continue to access the full range of Aeromexico fares, availability and schedules, under the same terms as the airline’s website, call centers and ticket offices.\nThe agreement also provides for the implementation of Amadeus Airline Fare Families and Amadeus Airline Ancillary Services to deploy Aeromexico’s merchandizing strategy across all Amadeus retailing interfaces, travel agency segments and worldwide points of sale.\nThese solutions add value to Amadeus travel agencies by facilitating their consultative role and ability to proactively upsell Aeromexico products that best match traveler preferences and needs. More than 120 airlines have contracted Amadeus Airline Ancillary Services (of which close to 80 have already been implemented), which is supporting airlines to deploy ancillary services in more than 100 markets worldwide both for the indirect and direct channels. Also, 16 airlines are currently displaying and upselling their branded fares in the indirect channel through Amadeus Fare Families.\n“We appreciate the value and business our travel agency partners represent for Aeromexico, therefore we are committed to working with them in the most efficient way possible,” said Anko Van der Werff, Aeromexico Chief Revenue Officer. He added, “The agreement with Amadeus allows us to benefit from their innovative technology to ensure that our offer is presented in a way that demonstrates its full value to our customers worldwide.”\n“Amadeus is committed to securing long-term distribution partnerships with leading airlines like Aeromexico in order to provide our subscribers with the content they need to meet travelers’ strong demand for comprehensive flight search options,” said Joost Schuring, Vice-President of Latin America and the Caribbean at Amadeus. He continued, “The adoption of advanced merchandizing solutions means Aeromexico can deliver its full product and service offering across all channels, thereby ensuring a consistent shopping experience that meets traveler needs while also supporting incremental revenues.”\nAmadeus plays a critical role in the multi-channel distribution of airline products and services ensuring global reach, maximized yield and support for airline merchandizing strategies. Today, more than 80% of Amadeus bookings worldwide are made on airlines with which Amadeus has a content agreement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:09:07.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
