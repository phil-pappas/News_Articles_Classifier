Some projects will provide accommodation and support for free during your visit, while others will require a contribution to help support their work. Here are some of the most interesting volunteering programs for international visitors in South America . Waves For Development, Peru \nSurfing is a sport that draws a lot of people to the coast of Peru, and this project has been operating in the country for several years, utilising the support of surfers and locals to help improve the lives of the people living in the area. This program is focused on the Pacific coast town of Lobitos, where there is not only a great surf community, but also plenty of opportunities to help support and promote local people and the local economy. \nVolunteering opportunities include helping to teach English, teaching local people about the environment and social entrepreneurship, along with introducing surf classes to disadvantaged young people in the area. Equilibrio Azul, Ecuador \nThis not for profit organization is one that looks to promote natural diversity and support the natural habitats that are found on the Ecuadorean coast, while also raising awareness for the importance of conservation in the area. \nThere are several programs that the organization runs, including the monitoring and tagging of Hawksbill turtles and monitoring the sea bird population in the region. Volunteers can expect to take part in these activities, or they can be involved in the education side of the charity, raising awareness and teaching people about the importance of conservation and the role Equilibrio Azul plays in this effort. Goles De Corazon, Colombia \nA foundation that is based on the positive impact that soccer can have on the lives of young people, Goles de Corazon looks to work with young people and improve their lives while sharing a joy of football at the same time. In an area where youth crime and drugs is a big issue, the work of the organization looks to draw young people away from those negative influences and to foster a community spirit and to encourage young people to embrace education. \nVolunteering opportunities involve building and maintaining green spaces to be used as football fields, while taking soccer classes is also a popular part of the project. Biblioworks, Bolivia \nBooks are a vital part of the education of young people across the world, and the libraries that are run in several locations across Bolivia by Biblioworks are a vital part of the educational progress that can be made by young people in these areas. \nVolunteer work here involves working with people of all ages, from children and teenagers through to adults, and especially focusing on the literacy and numeracy work involved in supporting these people. You can work from the head office in Sucre or one of the nine libraries operated around the country, and it is a rewarding and interesting volunteering experience. Estancia La Margarita, Argentina \nFor those that have already got horse riding skills, this is a different type of volunteering opportunity that allows you to support a local business to the south of Buenos Aires , at this gaucho school. International visitors and Argentinians visit the farm to enjoy horse trekking and learning gaucho skills, and volunteering here can include guiding tours, cleaning and maintaining the horses as well as helping around the farm. This is a great way to learn more about working on a gaucho farm, and is a fascinating volunteering experience.
