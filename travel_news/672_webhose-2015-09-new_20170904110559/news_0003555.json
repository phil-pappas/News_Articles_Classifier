Haggen sued rival grocer Albertsons in federal court Sept. 1, alleging Albertsons engaged in “coordinated and systematic efforts to eliminate competition and Haggen as a viable competitor in over 130 local grocery markets in five states.”\nIn court papers, Haggen accused Albertsons of destroying the profitability of the stores through a number of tactics, including allegedly misusing confidential data.\nAlbertsons, which has yet to answer the lawsuit, sold the stores as part of its acquisition of Safeway Inc., a transaction that made it the second largest grocery chain in the U.S.\nIn August, Bellingham, Wash., based Haggen announced it was closing or selling a number of stores, including many acquired from Albertsons, as part of a “right-sizing strategy.”\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/west-coast-grocer-haggen-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-1441798163?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T15:12:06.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
