The magazine's ranking lists TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® as the 20th best franchise for American veterans to consider opening in 2016, based on the company's devotion to working with those who have served our country.\nTWO MEN AND A TRUCK® CFO Jeff Wesley said the ranking validates the brand's commitment to actively recruiting veterans. Many of their current veteran franchisees are among the brand's strongest and most successful franchisees in the system.\n\"Many of the service men and women in our system bring invaluable work ethic, discipline and other intangible qualities that match what we look for in franchisees,\" Wesley said. \"More often than not, they are steadfast in their approach to business ownership and involvement within the system, and we couldn't be more pleased to have their level of commitment and drive to succeed in the TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® family.\"\nJaafar Mirlohi , a 29-year-old army veteran and newly signed TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® franchisee in Vallejo, California , said working with a company that values military civilians has been a positive experience.\n\"It's great to be part of a franchise that's pro-military,\" Mirlohi said. \"They don't just say it, they mean it – and prove it through their ongoing support and resources, which is huge for me.\"\nMirlohi said the support he has received from the corporate level down has exceeded his expectations.\n\"I'd say that any serviceperson after duty, or even those in the reserves, would be a perfect fit in the company because its systems and processes are just like the military,\" Mirlohi said. \"Life in the military translates well to this opportunity perfectly because TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® is very structured in its approach. With other veterans in the system, it's nice to have fellow franchisees who I can talk with and relate to.\"\nRecently, TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® participated in VetToCEO . The seven-week program provides qualified veterans and active duty military with the opportunity to learn more about building a career after completing service. Wesley, along with veteran and franchisee, Joey Hale , led a webinar to discuss why the company is so military-friendly and how to launch a civilian career as a franchisee.\nWith 14 military veterans in the TWO MEN AND A TRUCK® system, the company is eager to provide more opportunities to those seeking entrepreneurial opportunities.
