So if you’ve been putting off planning a vacation in the hopes that fall will bring lower prices, you’re in luck.\nWe’ve rounded up some best-bet destinations for bargain seekers in the coming months. The non-monetary bonus: fewer crowds and a less-frenzied pace. Read on for examples of deals currently available for late summer and fall trips. Like all deals, these are sure to expire; however, a little hunting on your part can yield similar results whenever you're ready to book.\nToronto\nCanada’s biggest city, Toronto, is bustling with revitalization on its waterfront and beyond. And thanks to the strength of the U.S. dollar (the Canadian loonie hit an 11-year low against the dollar in August), our neighbor to the north is more affordable.\nThis fall, the Delta Toronto — the city’s newest and tallest hotel — has a Special Events rate that knocks about 25% off the best available rate for visitors attending sports, music or cultural events. Take advantage of free downtown walking tours offered by the Royal Ontario Museum, or take in a free musical performance (September to May) at the Richard Bradshaw Amphitheatre in the fabulous Four Seasons Centre.\nEven getting to and from the airport is faster and less costly, thanks to the new Union Pearson Express, which whisks travelers from Pearson Airport to downtown Toronto in just 25 minutes.\nU.S. national parks\nWith the National Park Service poised to mark its 100th anniversary, the parks are gearing up for a busy 2016 summer season. Get a jump on the crowds — and save money, to boot — by visiting this fall. Rates for many lodgings outside the parks dip as seasonal demand slows. And even some iconic in-park hostelries are on sale. Case in point: A Winter Bed and Breakfast package (available in fall Nov. 12 - 19 and Nov. 29 - Dec. 20) at Utah’s Zion Lodge lops 70% off peak summer rates, and includes a hot breakfast for two.\nSofia, Bulgaria\nYes, we realize that Bulgaria’s capital is unlikely to make the short lists of all but seasoned travelers to Europe. But this overlooked Balkan city is full of delightful surprises, from its broad, yellow-brick avenues in the historic center to the partially exposed, 1,800-year-old Roman city that lies beneath. This fall, a centrally located three-star hotel, such as the stylish Hotel Arte, goes for about $60 a night, mid-week. (Rates at most hotels drop on weekends.) Expect to pay under $50 for a two-course meal for two with wine. Taxis are cheap and museum admissions are low. There’s even a free daily walking tour led by affable students eager to polish their English skills. Dozens of parks lie within the city, and there’s hiking and skiing on the 7,500-foot Vitosha Mountain, the highest of the peaks surrounding the capital.\nWe found round-trip airfares in October for under $800 from major U.S. departure cities including Boston and New York. Wait until November to travel and watch fares drop to the $700 range from cities like San Francisco and Chicago (compared with summer fares of about $1,400). High temperatures in Sofia are in the 60-degree range in November, making for pleasant walking-around weather.\nBrunswick Islands, N.C.\nNorth Carolina’s southernmost corner harbors five delightfully uncrowded barrier islands that can be less pricey than the popular Outer Banks region to the north and the hectic commercialism of Myrtle Beach, S.C., to the south.\nKnown collectively as the Brunswick Islands, Holden Beach, Sunset Beach, Ocean Isle Beach, Oak Island and Bald Head Island comprise a 45-mile stretch of wide, serene beaches. The weather — and the water — stay warm late into the fall, when rates drop precipitously.\nFor instance, two nights at the oceanfront Winds Resort Beach Club in Ocean Isle Beach start at $299, with a bottle of champagne, dinner for two, a tour and tasting at a local winery (including chauffeured sedan), breakfast and free use of bicycles, beginning Oct. 1. This “Wine Down — Island Style” package is offered through March 10.\nThe Winds Resort also offers a three-night golf package for play at three nearby courses as low as $259 (down from pre-Labor Day rates of $366) from Nov. 16 through Jan. 13. The deal includes three nights' lodging with a daily round of golf for two, plus daily breakfast.\nEurope\nThe continent is on sale! Every European currency has fallen against the U.S. dollar, including the euro, which tumbled about 20% earlier this year. Unfortunately, international airfares haven’t dropped as much as many would hope, given plummeting oil prices. But expect seasonally lower fares overall this fall.\nUSA TODAY\nSeven European countries where your dollar will go further\nOnce on the ground, you’ll get 20% savings on train travel starting Oct. 1 with the Eurail Global Pass (visit up to 28 countries in any order) and the Eurail Select Pass (travel to four adjoining countries). A first-class Eurail Select Pass for travel in Croatia/Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia costs about $222 for five days of travel in a two-month period. Five days of travel on a first-class Eurail Select Pass covering Austria, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy costs about $445, and is also good for travel within a two-month span.\nVancouver, Canada\nVancouver is one of North America’s most gorgeous coastal cities. And when the summer crowds sailing in and out of this popular cruise port depart in September, it’s even more alluring. The strength of the U.S. dollar brings about 20% more bang for your buck this year over last. And savvy shoppers will find additional fall discounts, among them 15% off best available rates plus an extra perk such as free parking, drinks or breakfast at the centrally located Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront through Dec. 30. And the stylish Opus Vancouver is cutting weekend rates 20% this fall, and will throw in breakfast, a welcome drink, loaner bikes and car service to downtown.\nVancouver is Canada’s California, so fall temperatures are mild (an average of 65 degrees in September and in the upper 40s in November), though late fall can be rainy. Beer lovers might want to time a visit for October to take in BC Craft Beer Month. There’s also the Hopscotch Whisky, Beer, and Spirit Festival between Nov. 16 and 22, which conveniently overlaps with the East Side Culture Crawl, which runs Nov. 19 - 22.\nREAD THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE:
