An artists’ reception will be held October 15, 2015, 5:00-7:00pm. The city of Chicago boasts over 75 neighborhoods with distinguishing personas experienced through their cuisine, shopping, art, history, architecture and heritage. The common thread is they all bring an element of excitement to the senses. This collection of work focuses on the rich colors, textures and sounds that ebb and flow as one moves about the city.\nThe Cornelia Arts Building, established in 1986, is one of the largest all-artist studio buildings on Chicago's Northside. Situated in a former ice house built in 1910, the building is the working space of over fifty local artists and artisans, including sculptors, painters, photographers, ceramic artists, print-makers, jewelry designers, textile artisans, and more. Located at 1800 West Cornelia Avenue, the building rests at the border of three distinct Chicago Neighborhoods; Lakeview, Roscoe Village, and North Center. An open house at the Cornelia Arts Building is scheduled for October 2, 2015, 6:00-10:00 pm.
