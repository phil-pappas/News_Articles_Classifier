Toward that end, resort staff delivers on that promise, so you’ll learn the true meaning of the word pampering if you stay here. \nEager to know what you can expect should you visit this Belize paradise? Take a moment to visit the resort’s home page right now, http://www.kaanabelize.com/ , and you will understand that this is no ordinary tropical destination. The accommodations are lush, amenities are outstanding and beneath the breezes and warming sun beats a heart of philanthropy that takes many forms. \nKa’ana Resort is dedicated to its community in ways you might not expect from a destination devoted to the good life. Both management and staff actively support many local charities, including Mary Open Doors, a shelter for battered women and children and The Octavia Waight Center, – a senior citizens’ home, but it’s their Program devoted to children of the community that excites the Ka’ana family most of all.As part of a country-wide Adopt-a-School Program, the Holy Cross Primary School, just 15 minutes down the road from Ka’ana, receives more than your average TLC courtesy of resort-generated financial and in-kind assistance. As a result, this small primary school serving around 76 kids doesn’t just function; it thrives. The desire to help the school and its pupils is contagious: Guests staying at the resort are often eager to jump in and help once they learn about the little school in Ka’ana’s neighborhood.Where to start? How about the building itself? Thanks to generous spirits, monetary contributions and generous hearts, Holy Cross will soon have separate new bathroom facilities for boys and girls; even the plumbing and electrical work is being taken care of by a community that cares. Other projects on the Ka’ana and Holy Cross’ wish list are roof repairs, improved cafeteria facilities and also additions to programming and curricula that include a sports program, too. \nThese improvements, however, are dwarfed by an ongoing effort to underwrite the tuitions of students whose families can’t afford to pay the school’s annual $38 USD charge. Turning a child away is never an option; so, the perpetual goal of Ka’ana’s efforts is focused on making sure there are cash reserves earmarked for tuition shortfalls. \nThe resort is currently running a special where guests can book 2 nights and pay only $20.00 for the 3rd night at Ka’ana in any room type. If you think that is all, for every third night booking, the resort will match that $20 and give towards the Holy Cross Primary School tuition program! \nIn return for this outpouring of love and help, the children of the Holy Cross Primary School are paying it forward! They study hard and make their extended families—including Ka’ana staff and guests—very proud. The most amazing aspect of this effort is the gratitude these sweet, respectful children express for the smallest improvements made to their school. Down the road, computers are on the radar, and if the Ka’ana staff and other supporters have their way, it certainly won’t be the last of their generosity. \nIf these children touch your heart and you’d like to help out, cash or in-kind donation is appreciated and goes a long way towards bettering their lives. Please contact info@kaanabelize.com and find out what it’s like to make a difference in the lives of these kids. The next time you visit Ka’ana, ask to meet them – you’re sure to be charmed!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T09:05:30.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
