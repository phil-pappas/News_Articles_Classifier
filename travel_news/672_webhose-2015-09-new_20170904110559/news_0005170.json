It will now sit in the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) executive council, which coordinates tourism issues and programmes worldwide, for two years. Kenya’s nomination was confirmed at the organisation’s ongoing general assembly in Medellin, Colombia.\nThe UN body lends its support to countries facing challenges related to tourism.Kenya has been a major beneficiary. UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai visited Kenya twice this year to offer support as the sector suffered due to insecurity.\nThe agency has also assisted in the development of a crisis management handbook, which will be shared among the players across the globe.\nCommerce and Tourism Cabinet Secretary Phyllis Kandie said Kenya was privileged to\nrepresent East Africa and the African continent at the council.\n“The East African Community is one of the fastest growing regional economic blocs in the world. It is also endowed with some of the most remarkable tourist attractions to be found anywhere in the globe,” Mrs Kandie said.\nAlready, the region has launched a single tourist visa and the EAC is working towards a joint marketing board to package the region as a single destination.\nThe Cabinet secretary also supported the setting up of the official development assistance programme to aid member states to develop their tourism sectors.\n“Globally, the tourism sector has become a foundation for economic growth and a source for foreign exchange, job and wealth creation as well as medium for human interaction,” she said.\nThe agenda for discussion includes the UNWTO forum on talent, development tourism, investing in youth, sustainability, air transport development, and competitiveness.\nMrs Kandie, who is accompanied by Kenyan Ambassador to Spain Bramwel Kisuya, Kenya Tourism Board managing director Muriithi Ndegwa, Kenya Utalii College principal Kenneth Ombongi and Tourism Secretary Anne Kinyua, will also participate in several panel discussions. She invited the delegates at the assembly to the upcoming Africa Travel Association congress, which is to be held in Nairobi from November 9 to 14.\nThe assembly is the governing organ of the UNWTO that brings together 154 countries and sets the agenda for the global tourism sector.\nTourism’s ability to foster inclusive development and social transformation will be the focus during this 21st session of the general assembly.\nIn 2014, despite several challenges, international tourism reached new records, with 1,133 million tourists travelling the world and contributing $1.5 trillion in exports.\nColombia is hosting the assembly for the second time, following the one in 2007 in Cartagena de Indias. The event is expected to attract over 800 delegates from the agency’s member states, the private sector and academia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:37:45.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
