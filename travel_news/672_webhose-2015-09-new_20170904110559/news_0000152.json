(OTC: NEWL) (\"NewLead\" or the \"Company\") announced today that the Company did not complete the agreement to supply and deliver 1.48 million tons of steam coal to a third party that was expected to generate $148.0 million of revenue, as such agreement was previously announced on February 26, 2013.\nSpecifically, as previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2012 , filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on August 30, 2013 , under \"Item 4.

In May and July 2013 , New Lead JMEG LLC received notices of termination on the two of those Sale Purchase Agreements (the February 26, 2013 announcement refers to one of those two agreements) to supply approximately $245.1 million of thermal coal to one of the third parties due to ongoing defaults by New Lead JMEG LLC under the agreements.\"\nFurthermore, on March 12, 2014 , NewLead, New Lead JMEG and the third party reached a settlement agreement pursuant to which the third party agreed to receive shares of the Company's common stock having a value at such time equal to the settlement amount of approximately US $704,000 in full and final satisfaction of the obligations under the coal supply contract. The Company issued the shares of common stock to the third party on March 26, 2014 .\nThe projected revenue, though based on the signed contract, was at the very high end of the performance of the contact.\nFor further information, please visit the Company's SEC filings at the \"Investor Relations\" section under \"SEC Filings\", \" http://www.newleadholdings.com/sec.html \".

These statements, as well as words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" and \"expect,\" are intended to be ''forward-looking\" statements. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions and beliefs about future events may vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, such matters as the creditworthiness of our counterparties, the reliability of reserve reports, our ability to extract or acquire coal to fulfill contracts, the consummation of conditional contracts, future operating or financial results; our liquidity position and cash flows, our ability to borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility and, if needed, to obtain waivers from our lenders and restructure our debt, and our ability to continue as a going concern; statements about planned, pending or recent vessel disposals and/or acquisitions, business strategy, future dividend payments and expected capital spending or operating expenses, including dry-docking and insurance costs; statements about trends in the product tanker and dry bulk vessel shipping segments, including charter rates and factors affecting supply and demand; expectations regarding the availability of vessel acquisitions; completion of repairs; length of off-hire; availability of charters; and anticipated developments with respect to any pending litigation. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although NewLead believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, NewLead cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections described in the forward looking statements. Important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including changes in charter rates and vessel values, failure of a seller to deliver one or more vessels, and other factors discussed in NewLead's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. NewLead expressly disclaims any obligations or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in NewLead's expectations with respect thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.\nInvestor and Media Relations:\nElisa Gerouki\nNewLead Holdings Ltd.\nTelephone: + 30 213 014 8023\nEmail: egerouki@newleadholdings.com\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150303/179145LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newlead-holdings-ltd-announces-updates-to-previously-disclosed-coal-supply-and-delivery-contract-300151055.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newlead-holdings-ltd-announces-updates-to-previously-disclosed-coal-supply-and-delivery-contract-300151055.html", "http://www.newleadholdings.com/annual-reports.html", "http://www.newleadholdings.com/sec.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150303/179145LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY15235&Transmission_Id=201509291630PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY15235&DateId=20150929", "http://www.newleadholdings.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150303/179145LOGO"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T03:34:03.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
