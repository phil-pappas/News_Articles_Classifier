The project will secure the Banff Gondola as the Rocky Mountains' premier mountaintop experience offering visitors to Banff National Park more to see, learn and do than ever before.\n\"Generations of explorers have visited Banff National Park to discover all it has to offer. The enhancements we announced today will ensure all future guests are able to harness their spirit of adventure with a world-class mountaintop experience unlike any other in the Rocky Mountains or around the globe,\" said David McKenna , President of Brewster Travel Canada.\nBrewster has partnered with PCL Construction and sister-company Global Experience Specialists to design and build the new facility. Although the footprint will remain unchanged, the existing structure will be retrofitted into a modern building with modern amenities including welcoming, elevated public spaces, new food and beverage outlets and improved washroom facilities. Highlights of the experiential transformation will include:\nThe addition of a holistic and interactive family-friendly interpretive experience that will ignite each visitor's understanding of and passion for Banff National Park and its unique ecosystems. A cornerstone of the interpretive experience is the addition of a 40-seat cinema showcasing a curated theatre presentation; An expanded rooftop viewing deck providing unparalleled 360 degree views of the Banff town site, the Bow Valley and the surrounding Rocky Mountains; A conference space that will accommodate weddings, corporate events and other groups of up to 150 people. New culinary offerings including both grab-to-go and full-service sit down options that provide a well-rounded menu for locals and visitors alike. To ensure minimal impact on the surrounding wildlife of Sulphur Mountain, scheduling of potentially disruptive activities has been planned to avoid the most sensitive period for wildlife species. Construction is set to begin on September 8, 2015 at which time the existing upper terminal facilities will no longer be accessible to the public. The Banff Gondola will be fully operational and the Banff SummitWalk will be fully accessible through October 25, 2015 after which time it will close to the public for the rest of the year. Limited facilities in the new upper terminal will re-open to the public on May 1, 2016 with full project completion anticipated for August 1 , 2016.\nThe Banff Gondola redevelopment represents the largest capital project Brewster has undertaken in recent years and reflects Brewster's commitment to delivering an exceptional guest experience. It surpasses the Glacier Skywalk, the addition of a fourth boat at the Banff Lake Cruise, the ongoing refurbishment of 21 Ice Explorers at the Glacier Adventure and the current renovation of the Banff International Hotel.\nAbout Brewster Travel Canada\nFor 123 years, Brewster Travel Canada has been delivering premium Canadian travel experiences to the global market by connecting travelers to one of the world's most spectacular natural locations.
