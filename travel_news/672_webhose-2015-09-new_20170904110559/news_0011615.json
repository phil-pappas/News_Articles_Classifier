Modules have about a 5-inch square footprint. The base unit has an Intel Pentium or Intel Celeron processor with up to 8GB DDR4 RAM. You do have to open it to add memory but, according to Acer, that requires loosening only one screw.The advantage to the Revo Build Series (M1-601) is that it enables users to “build” (really expand) their own PCs without having to deal with opening up the box or connecting any wires. Only sort of like the old days I used to build my own PCs. It was a very geeky experience, and not for anyone who isn’t comfortable with jumpers, sticking boards into slots and figuring out which cables go where.But I stopped doing this years ago and even though I own a desktop PC, I have never even taken it apart to add boards. Thanks to USB ports and built-in sound and graphics, it’s just not necessary anymore.And most people don't even buy desktop PCs these days. Laptops and now 2-in-one tablet/laptops are more popular than desktops. Optional blocks Acer offers additional “blocks” including a 500 GB and 1 TB potable hard drive that can be “hot swapped” while the machine is running. There is also a wireless power bank for charging phones and an audio block with speakers and microphones. At the press event, Acer CEO Jason Chen encouraged attendees to suggest other modules to add to the line. Interesting but not essential While this is an interesting approach, I doubt whether it’s going to be a mass market product. It would have been a great idea several years ago but – for most PC users – there really isn’t a need for expansion modules other than USB devices that an easily be connected to just about any desktop or laptop.Apple’s Mac Mini and HP’s tiny Mini Pavilion Desktop are examples of excellent little desktop PCs that, though ports, have all the expansion options that most people will need. I have used both extensively and have never wished that I could take them apart to add modules.And while I applaud Acer’s desire to appeal to the DIY (do it yourselfers), this is harder a hobbyist machine – really more a consumer device that can be expanded via proprietary modules from Acer, unlike those old desktops that accepted expansion cards from virtually any manufacturer or today’s USB equipped PCs that can also be expanded via devices from just about anyone.The Acer Revo Build M1-601 will be available in October with prices starting at €199 ($224).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:08:40.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
