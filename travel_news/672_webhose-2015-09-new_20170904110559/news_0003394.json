The hotels, located in Oss, in southern Holland, and Sneek, in the north of the country, are open until the end of September 2015. The en-suite rooms have running water, showers, and comfortable beds, and are decorated with elaborate sand sculptures. \nThe Medieval feel of the sand hotels — with their castle sculptures complete with mottes and crenelated battlements — is inspired by the “journey through time” theme of the sand sculpture festival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:13:51.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
