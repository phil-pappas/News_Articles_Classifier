The North American Carbon Black market has a value of $3.6 billion as of 2014. The market, estimated to grow at a CAGR of xx% during the forecast perdion, is projected to reach $xx billion by 2020. United States has the largest market with a share of xx%. The total production capacity for Carbon Black in U.S. is estimated to be xx million metric tons. Mexico is growing at a fast pace in this region.\nCarbon black is mainly used as a pigment and reinforcing filler in automobile tires as it conducts heat away from the tread and belt area of the tire, reducing thermal damage and increasing tire life. These account for 75% of the global usage. Carbon black particles are also employed in some radar absorbent materials, photocopier and laser printer toner as well as inks and paints.\nThe high tinting strength and stability of carbon black also makes it useful in coloring of resins and films. About 16% of world production goes into belts, hoses, and other non-tire rubber goods and the rest goes into pigment in inks, coatings and plastics. Carbon black improves tensile strength and wear resistance of rubber. This makes it useful in elastomers for aircraft vibration control components such as engine mounts.\nExtensive research focused on developing improved grades of Carbon Black is anticipated to increase the scope of their utilization to a greater extent. Innovation in products has become the standard strategy adopted by major players in this sector.\nSPECIALITIES OF THIS REPORT\n1) The report will be useful in gaining an exhaustive understanding of the regional market.
