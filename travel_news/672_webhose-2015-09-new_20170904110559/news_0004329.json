According to MLB Executive Director Greg Donovan, AAE, this is a sign of things to come, and reflects the airport’s first fulfillment of a commitment to bring more international tourism to the region. “Canada is our top visitor market,” said Donovan. “We are a concierge airport – connecting another concierge airport – with the famous Porter experience.” \nThe weekly seasonal flights will commence December 19th from Toronto’s Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ), located on an island in the heart of Toronto, ensuring a shorter travel time to Toronto’s central business and entertainment districts, and ensuring passengers avoid the stress of colossal airports. \n“We see this as a great opportunity to meet current requests that we have for Florida flights and demonstrate the demand that exists for Porter to serve the state in a more meaningful way long term,” said Robert Deluce, president and CEO of Porter Airlines. \n“This new service opens up a total of 8 Canadian markets for our region,” said Eric Garvey, executive director of the Space Coast Office of Tourism. They include Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, Thunder Bay, Timmins and Windsor. \nOrlando Melbourne International Airport is located on beachside Florida and is the closest airport to Port Canaveral cruises, Space Coast beaches, the Kennedy Space Center and a short drive to the world’s most popular theme parks including Walt Disney World, SeaWorld, Universal Studios Florida and the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. \nCanada’s largest city, Toronto encompasses one-fourth of the country’s population and a whopping half of its nation’s wealth. “International visitors stay longer, and Canadian tourists of this caliber inject more discretionary funds into the local economy. And by flying via MLB, their Florida vacation starts nearly immediately,” said Garvey. \nMelbourne Airport Authority Chairman Bill Potter said, “It will be great to see our vision for our international concourse fulfilled. We value this opportunity to showcase our airport’s international capabilities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:16:11.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
