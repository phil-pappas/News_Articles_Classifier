Look for a sign to the right to the basic picnic area. You can park here. A walker is dwarfed by the massive overhang of The Drip.

Source: Supplied\nThe path cuts through mossy grasses and huge cliffs line the gorge’s rock walls. You follow the Goulburn River through a ferny glade, crossing a small bridge at one point before you reach the only confusing part of the walk — an unmarked fork in the road.\nHead down to the water and under an arch rock. It looks like a dead end, as your next step is seemingly into the water, but take a few stepping stones and a sharp left and the path resumes back up to the cliff face, past some unusual honeycomb-patterned rock and on to The Drip curtain.\nOn the way to The Drip. Source: Supplied\nArtist Brett Whiteley painted a mural on rocks on the opposite side of the river, which can be seen from the walk side — if you know where to look.\nThe water is clear, there’s a sandy beach and huge fallen rocks provide great seats.\nThe 1.5km walk takes about 30 minutes each way.\nHANDS ON ROCK\nTurn right out of The Drip picnic area and continue north on the Cassilis road for a few hundred metres. It is poorly signposted but look for a blue mine sign on the left. Turn sharp left and drive down a bumpy track to a car park. Take a 600m uphill walk to a resplendent and vibrantly coloured cliff face. You’ll get there within 10 minutes.\nThe stencilled Aboriginal hand prints on Hands On Rock. Source: Supplied\nBehind a barrier on the cliff face are excellent examples of Aboriginal art. This was an important historical area for indigenous people — believed to be on trade route from the coast to the inland.\nHands On Rock is exactly what it says: hand stencils created by spraying coloured clay pigments over hands.\nRest a while on the benches provided to take in the art, the serenity and the majesty.\nPUTTA BUCCA WETLANDS\nWhile most Mudgee bushwalks are into ancient gorges, this one, just over the bridge from the centre of town has existed for just a few years.\nAn old quarry, sewerage plant and tip have been recycled back to the area’s pre-settlement state as a billabong lined with red river gums.\n“It has put us on the map as one of the 100 top birdwatching spots in Australia”\nEcologist Kurtis Lindsay says the whole area was once covered in billabongs.\n“When the first settlers came, they saw the grazing potential and drained all\nthe billabongs and ploughed the whole area.”\nIt took until 2009 before restoration began, and it has provided instant results, attracting more than 140 bird species.\nKurtis Lindsay in the Putta Bucca wetlands. Picture: David Fitzsimons Source: Supplied\n“It has put us on the map as one of the 100 top birdwatching spots in Australia,” Lindsay says.\n“We have a huge suite of threatened species here, which brings in the birdwatchers.”\nLast year, twitchers were in a flutter when an extremely rare citrine wagtail flew in — only the third sighting of the bird ever in Australia.\n“Over 250 bird watchers came from all over Australia to see it. It was good for the local economy, ” Lindsay says.\nThe bird is normally never seen south of India but it stayed from August-October.\n“We thought it was lost. It might have been blown over by a cyclone and just got lost.”\nWith help from the Green Army, an environmental program for young people, the area is continually being improved to become a haven for bird and wildlife.\nThere is a 1km (10-minute) path through the wetlands that includes two bird hides, where you can set up your binoculars and view activities on the now water-filled\nold quarry.\nFERNTREE GULLY\nTake a scenic 40-minute drive southeast from Mudgee via Lue (pronounced Lu-ee). Turn left before the historic Rylstone village, and go about 15km before you arrive at the turn off to Ferntree Gully.\nIt’s a bumpy 2km trip into the area for the first of two walks. The first is a short 1km loop known as the Sydney Peppermint Walk, which also has a further 1.8km loop.\nBut the second walk, the Gully Walk, is more dramatic.\nSoon after leaving the picnic area, you descend into an enormous rainforest gully where the green and browns of the plants, trees, mosses and leaves collide with the autumn hues of the steep rock walls.\nFerntree Gully Trust committee members Mike and Sue Pridmore say platypuses and lyrebirds can often be spotted here.\n“You are almost guaranteed of seeing a lyrebird,” says Sue.\nAnd if you don’t, you will hear one. “Lyrebirds are very much part of the region.”\nOn the cliff walls, huge roots from Port Jackson fig trees cling to the rocks.\n“It looks like the trees are holding up the rocks, not the other way around,” Mike observes.\nYou clamber over rocks through the gully to arrive at a boardwalk. Soon after come the 100 steps that take you from the gully floor to the surface in barely a minute.\nTwo lookouts offer extraordinary views, and the blue hue in the distance is the Wollemi National Park, barely 2km away.\nThe 2.5km walk will take about an hour, including scenic stops.\nRYLSTONE COMMON\nIf time is short, take this 1.5km (20-minute) bushwalk that starts on the southern edge of town. Follow a path that\nsteps down to Cudgegong River before returning in a loop that ends at the car park.\nWhile it lacks the dramatic cliffs of other walks, it is a pleasant bush experience.\nDUNNS SWAMP\nSadly closed for a road repair when Best Weekend called, but now reopened to the public, Dunns Swamp — about 20km from Rylstone — is a haven for picnickers, canoeists and campers.\nThere are several walks, ranging from 500m-5.5km, in this area of the Wollemi National Park that highlight pagoda rock formations, Aboriginal art and caves.\nDunns Swamp was\nwell known to the local Wiradjuri people but in the 1920s it was dammed to provide water to the cement works, 25km away in Kandos, and became used as a recreation site.\nTHE FESTIVAL\nNow you’ve earned your tucker, enjoy this month’s Mudgee Wine & Food Festival, in its 37th year.\nThere are three main events on three consecutive weekends. It starts with Go Tasting, with more than 130 local wines on offer on September 12. Next comes Go Grazing, a food and wine tasting event on September 19. And finally there’s Flavours Of Mudgee, with food, wine and live entertainment in the centre of town on September 26.\nAdd in markets, farm and winery tours and tastings and there is more than enough to keep you occupied.\nThe writer travelled courtesy of Central NSW Tourism and Mudgee Region Tourism\ndavid.fitzsimons@news.com.au\nTwitter: @FitzAtLarge\nGetting there\n● Mudgee is a 3.5 hour (268km) drive from Sydney.
