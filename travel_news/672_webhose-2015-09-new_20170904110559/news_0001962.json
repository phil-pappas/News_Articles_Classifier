The award is DFW Airport’s first to be recognized by Guinness World Records, which is the authority on record-breaking achievements around the world. A Guinness World Records adjudicator was on-site to judge and witness the record-breaking event.\nThe event was held in front of the Dallas Cowboys Club, an exclusive new full-service dining venue in Terminal A, offering travelers an upscale Dallas Cowboys experience featuring advanced Texas-inspired cuisine and a modern-feeling venue.\nIn addition to breaking the Guinness World Records title, DFW transformed the recently renovated Terminal A into a tailgate party. Tailgate offerings included the world’s only Pepsi® Pre-Flight Drills interactive running back/football challenge game, offering tailgaters a one-of-a-kind experience to show off their running back skills for the chance to win a trip to the big game, signed helmets, gift cards, and more. The Pepsi Pre-Flight Drills interactive game will remain stationed inside Terminal A at Gates A12 and B29 making it accessible to travelers now through October 10.\n“We pride ourselves in offering passengers a fun, unique and memorable experience while traveling through DFW Airport,” said Mazhar Butt, senior vice president at DFW Airport. “Our tailgate party to kick off this year’s football season, combined with the rare opportunity to be part of breaking a Guinness World Records title, is another example of our commitment to providing an unique and interactive customer experience.”\nTailgaters were encouraged to post and share photos on social media using the hashtag, #DFWTailgate.\n(re)defining DFW International Airport\nDFW International Airport’s $2.69 billion Terminal Renewal and Improvement Program (TRIP) is (re)defining first class for this global gateway.
