A North Dakota cooperative is investing more than $8 million in a new gas station and travel center in Devils Lake in hopes of attracting truck drivers bound for the oil patch. Officials with Farmer's Union Oil, which is the new travel center, believe too many truckers drive through Devils Lake without stopping. \"With all the growth that's been going around Devils Lake right now we thought it was a definite need,\" said Farmer's Union Oil CEO Tom Haar, who noted that they want to \"capture more highway traffic that is going west to the Bakken.\" The 10,000 square-foot facility will feature 10 diesel islands, 12 gasoline islands and a trucker's lounge with showers, WDAZ-TV reported. Todd Hard, the superintendent for the project, said it's the largest travel center he's ever worked on. The project's site had no infrastructure, so water and sewer pipes are being installed, which could aid other businesses looking to build as well. Haar said the company has development agreements with a restaurant and a \"potential hotel\" to open in the same area as the travel center. The center is expected to open in April or May, in time for the busy summer driving season.
