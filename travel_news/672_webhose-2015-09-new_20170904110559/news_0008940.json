The aircraft are achieving a mission success rate in excess of 90%.\nThe RAF’s Deputy Commander Capability, Air Marshal Sir Baz North said: “This significant milestone is an important achievement in the A400M Atlas’ contribution to the Royal Air Force’s operational air transport inventory. Over the last 5 years the service has been able to recapitalise its air transport Fleets into an agile and adaptable capability, delivering a modern and highly reliable Air Mobility force for UK defence.”\nRichard Thompson, Head of Military Aircraft UK, Airbus Defence and Space said: “We have been steadily building a robust and stable Atlas operation at Brize Norton which is showing extremely promising results. Now we are absolutely focused on delivering the enhanced military capabilities that will enable the aircraft to fulfill its full potential.”\nSource:- Airbus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:07:44.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
