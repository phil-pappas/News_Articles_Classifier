We can tolerate the hunger but we just want to sleep.' \nThe continent's biggest migratory flow since the end of World War II has caused a deep rift between western and eastern EU members over how to distribute the migrants. \nThe crisis has raised questions over the fate of the Schengen agreement allowing borderless travel across most countries within the 28-nation bloc with several of them imposing border controls. \nHungary's right-wing government in particular has faced international criticism over violent clashes with migrants and a hastily erected fence along its border with Serbia. \nThe Hungarian authorities began transporting thousands of migrants straight to the border with Austria on Friday in an apparent bid to move them through and out of their territory as quickly as possible. \nBut despite heated rhetoric between Budapest and Zagreb authorities on both sides are showing high levels of cooperation on the ground. \nAFP correspondents reported that on Saturday and into the night around 15 Croatian buses brought hundreds of migrants to Baranjsko Petrovo Selo who crossed on foot to Beremend in Hungary where Hungarian buses were waiting for them. \nEarly Sunday several waiting buses could be seen on the Hungarian side and Croatian radio said several buses were headed toward Beremend. \nAnd around 1000 migrants on Saturday boarded a train in Tovranik in the far east of Croatia traveling to a stop near the Hungarian town of Letenye which they could reach on foot. \nIn Sunday's accident off the Turkish coast the boat was carrying 46 migrants from northwestern Turkey to Lesbos one of the Greek islands that has seen a heavy influx of refugees from war-torn Syria via Turkey. \nTwenty-two people were rescued the Greek coast guard said. \nA survivor whose name was given as Haseen told Greek state news agency ANA: 'It was dark we saw the ship bearing down on us. We tried to signal with flashlights and cellphones but they did not see us.' \nThrown overboard the passengers fought to keep their heads above water. 'We lost the children. We could not see them in the dark' Haseen said. \nMore than 2600 people have died among the nearly half a million who have braved perilous trips across the Mediterranean to reach Europe so far this year. \nThe Italian navy said it was carrying out two operations on Sunday rescuing nearly 250 migrants off the Libyan coast after picking up more than 4500 on Saturday. \nAnd the Libyan coast guard said it rescued 215 migrants Sunday from two boats in the Mediterranean including more than 50 women. \nMany migrants have turned to Turkey's land borders with Greece and Bulgaria to avoid the sea voyage. \nAltogether Greece has seen more than 3 migrants enter the country this year most of them passing through to other European countries. \nEU interior ministers are to meet again on Tuesday followed by an emergency summit on Wednesday. \nEU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn said the bloc was earmarking aid of 'up to one billion euros' (1.13 billion) to encourage Syrian refugees in Turkey to stay there. \nOf the more than four million Syrians who have fled their country nearly half have sought shelter in Turkey while more than a million are now living in Lebanon and at least 6 in Jordan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T10:31:39.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
