In line with Dubai Plan 2021 and 7-Year National Agenda, the programme will seek to empower and grow a new generation of talent for the theme park industry, one of the UAE’s most exciting growth sectors.\nThe programme includes three divisions, Forsati, Sahim, and Helmi, which offer Emiratis of all career levels – from new graduates to future leaders – an inspiring range of job opportunities.\nForsati, meaning my ‘opportunity’ in Arabic, will comprise a development programme for UAE Nationals of high school education or below and provide a total of 6 months training. Sahim, Arabic for ‘contribute’, will offer a direct recruit of UAE nationals at all levels with high school education and above with minimum 3 years’ experience across all departments within Dubai Parks and Resorts. Helmi, which means ‘my dream’ in Arabic, will offer graduates an exciting scholarship programme.\nEach programme division will empower participants to become well-trained professionals, who will play a central role in driving the the operations of the company’s three theme parks in Dubai that are set to open in October 2016.\nRaed Al Nuaimi, Chief Executive Officer of Dubai Parks and Resorts, said: “Through the launch of this Emiratisation programme we aim to build a significant talent pool of Emirati professionals in theme park operations. Building Emirati talent is part of our commitment to accomplishing the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, to nurture and empower Emirati skillsets in all business sectors.”\nHe added: “We are setting a new milestone in Dubai’s leisure and entertainment industry through our ground breaking theme parks. However, we believe that alongside our investment in building a robust leisure industry infrastructure, it is equally important to inspire a new generation of Emirati talent to drive its operations. This is key to the long-term sustainability of the theme park industry in the UAE.”\nDubai Parks and Resorts is developing the Middle East’s largest multi-themed, integrated family entertainment destination. The resort will feature the region’s first LEGOLAND, along with a LEGOLAND Water Park, as well as motiongate Dubai – a unique theme park showcasing some of Hollywood’s most beloved characters from DreamWorks Animation, Sony Pictures Studios and Lionsgate. Committed to bringing together the best of the East and West, Dubai Parks and Resorts will also feature Bollywood Parks Dubai, the first ever theme park based on the sights and sounds of Bollywood.\nThe entire destination will be connected by Riverland Dubai – a retail, dining and entertainment walkway and guests can stay at the Lapita Hotel, a Polynesian-themed resort catering to families.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:28:08.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
