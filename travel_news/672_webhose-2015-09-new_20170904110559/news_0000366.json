That’s when cruise lines need to get their ships from high-demand summer cruising locations to the high-demand winter cruising locations. We see a lot of deals in the fall from Europe to the U.S. and from Vancouver, Canada, to Southern California.\nThese cruises have fewer stops with more days at sea, but you will enjoy the same amenities at a cheaper price. You’ll have access to all-you-can-eat meals, pools and free entertainment while on board, just at a discounted price.\nTrans-Atlantic cruises are often 10 to 18 days long, so you’ll need two weeks or more for your vacation when you factor in flying to and from your port cities.\nIf you want to take a shorter cruise, the Pacific Coast of the U.S. and Canada is a good bet. Many of these cruises are three to five days long, but if you want a really short cruise, Norwegian has a one-night cruise from Seattle to Vancouver departing on Sept. 27. Rates start at $29 for an inside cabin, $39 for an ocean view, $59 for a balcony and $79 for a suite.\nIf you’re not sure if a cruise is for you, this could be a cheap way to test one out. We have seen one-way fares from Dallas to Seattle for $125 and one-way fares between Vancouver and Dallas as low as $190.\nPrincess Cruises has a three-night cruise departing Vancouver on Sept. 20 and arriving in Los Angeles. Rates start at $139 for an inside cabin, but an ocean view cabin is $10 cheaper at $129; a balcony cabin is $339, but a suite is cheaper than a balcony, at $329.\nFares from Los Angeles can be very cheap, as low as $41 one way on Southwest, and other airlines may have similar one-way fares.\nNorwegian is offering a 16-night cruise departing on Oct. 29 from Barcelona to Houston. Prices start at $599 for an inside cabin, $699 for an ocean view cabin, $999 for a balcony cabin and $1,399 for a suite. The cruise stops in Funchal, Portugal; Madeira; Charlotte Amelie, Virgin Islands; St. Thomas; and Miami before arriving in Houston.\nRoyal Caribbean is offering a 12-night cruise from Civitavecchia, near Rome, to San Juan at prices starting at $592 for an inside cabin, $686 for an ocean view, $944 for a balcony and $1,710 for a suite. The cruise departs Civitavecchia on Nov. 6 and stops in Valencia, Spain; Lisbon and Ponta Delgado, Portugal, before arriving in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nIf you are traveling from Dallas, you will have to travel to get to your departure port and to get home from your destination port. We do see a few trans-Atlantic cruises that arrive in Houston, which can be a great option.\nOne piece of advice I like to give when cruising is to plan to arrive at least a day in advance for U.S. cruise ports, and at least two days before your departure when going to Europe, so you don’t miss the boat if your flight is delayed or canceled.\nWhen looking for one-way fares to Europe, you may find better fares flying from Houston or New York City, Boston, Chicago or Miami. As an example, we found October one-way fares from New York to Barcelona in the $800 range, but out of Dallas the fare was over $1,300 on Aer Lingus and over $2,000 on American.\nWhen looking for repositioning cruises, search for “trans-Atlantic” for cruises to or from Europe and “Pacific Coast” or “West Coast” for cruises between Vancouver, Canada, and West Coast cities. We also are seeing repositioning cruises in April and May from the U.S. to Europe and from California back to Vancouver. The spring cruises to Vancouver are often cheaper than September cruises, which may be because the September weather is warmer than April and May.\nThe prices listed above were valid at press time, but are subject to change, and sample cruise prices are per person, based on double occupancy. Depending on demand, cruise fares can go up and down like a yo-yo and airfares also fluctuate. If prices are high, you may want to wait and check again because they could fall.\nTom Parsons is the editor of bestfares.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T05:28:31.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
