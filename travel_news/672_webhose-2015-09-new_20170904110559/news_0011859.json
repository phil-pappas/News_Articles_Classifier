Thome | Sep 08, 2015 eTN Exclusive: Unique and original, timely, global breaking news: \nThe announcement by Air Seychelles that the airline had signed a codeshare deal with partner Etihad to connect Mahe with Entebbe (via Abu Dhabi) went down like a lead balloon. \nMr. Roy Kinnear, Air Seychelles’ Chief Executive Officer, when making the announcement, said: “We are pleased to expand our codeshare with Etihad Airways to include Uganda, which is experiencing a period of impressive economic growth. Backed by strong economic development, Uganda has seen a corresponding and significant rise in the number of leisure travelers, who now have convenient, one-stop access to Seychelles. By working together with Etihad Airways and South African Airways, we have been able to expand our network to nine destinations in Africa, and with this development, look forward to welcoming guests from Uganda on board our flights”. \nThree out of seven travel agents requested to comment responded with a three letter code from the social media scene – “SMH” – indicating they were merely shaking their heads over the new deal and two others questioned the rationale of the code shared service. One of those wrote: “Me I don’t know with whom they consulted, maybe only Etihad, but why would someone want to fly to Mahe via the Gulf? It more than doubles traveling time. I book Ugandans to Seychelles with Ethiopian or Kenya Airways which is direct and saves a lot of time. Anyway, even Etihad must have their agenda because they only manage to fly four times to Entebbe. They had said daily but the traffic is not there because Emirates and Qatar and Fly Dubai are daily and give them hard competition. They would of course look for any straw to cling on to add some extra passengers. This is only good for the two airlines but not for Ugandans who want to visit Seychelles. I wonder what fares they will use to win passengers but it has to be a lot less than what ET charges for their tickets to make this work.” \nAnother agent, also on condition of not being named, looked at a different aspect when asking: “Why don’t they codeshare with Kenya Airways? That way they open up not just Nairobi and Entebbe but the entire East Africa. That would make sense; forcing clients to travel through Abu Dhabi, no, that is not good business sense. Because after all, Etihad already codeshares from Nairobi to Entebbe with KQ, so why this complicated routing?” \nAir Seychelles has made strong headway through code share arrangements with both Etihad and Etihad partners (Air Berlin and Alitalia – among others – in the European market and Jet Airways in the Indian market), which has become an applauded move. \nHowever, the route to Entebbe via Abu Dhabi is not likely to be a game changer in terms of the numbers of Ugandans who want to visit Mahe, Praslin, La Digue and other archipelago islands, considering the detour and extra time required. While the Seychelles as a destination has become increasingly popular with Ugandans and other East Africans as a result of extensive marketing and affordability, travelers from Uganda are likely to stick to the two airlines offering the shortest routes to Mahe instead of routing via the Gulf.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:48:42.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
