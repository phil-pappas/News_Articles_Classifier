This donation marks the company’s sixth consecutive $5,000 donation. The Annual Giving Campaign is the Foundation’s key yearly fundraiser that supports its core missions, including providing scholarships to hospitality management students, funding grants for pertinent industry research such as diversity and technology advancement, and promoting hospitality as a career of choice.\n“We are so appreciative to RLJ Lodging Trust for their longstanding support of the Foundation and its programs and their role in strengthening the lodging industry as a whole,” said AH&LEF president & CFO Joori Jeon. “RLJ has set a strong precedent and clear message that their financial contributions ensure the continued success of our industry.”\nAH&LEF is the not-for-profit affiliate of the American Hotel & Lodging Association and is funded solely by charitable donations from progressive hospitality leaders and companies within the industry. In 2014, AH&LEF disbursed more than $1 million to prepare promising college students for a career in hospitality, to attract and retain talented industry professionals, and to fund valuable research for the industry. Since the Foundation’s inception, more than $18.5 million has been distributed through its scholarship, education, outreach, and research programs.\nSource:- AH&LEF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T12:51:52.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
