An impression of the Durrington Walls horseshoe \nThe entire horseshoe arrangement faced virtually due east and appears to have been aligned with a specific and very prominent natural landmark (now known as Beacon Hill) some three miles away. \nSignificantly, this is the same hill that the western part of the 1.9 mile long pre-Stonehenge era sacred enclosure - the so-called 'Stonehenge Cursus' (potentially a place for Neolithic religious processions) - is also aligned with. \nIt therefore now appears that this major natural feature, Beacon Hill, may well have been of greater significance in prehistoric times than previously realised. \nIndeed, it is conceivable that it was revered as some sort of sacred landmark - perhaps embodying a now long forgotten nature spirit or deity. Identification of prominent topographical features with divine beings or nature spirits is common in many of the world's most ancient indigenous religious traditions. \nIn around 2600 BC, the Beacon-Hill-aligned cursus was finally eclipsed by the construction of a new solar cult temple - the 'giant stones' main phase of Stonehenge - and, in around 2500 BC, the Durrington horseshoe was decommissioned and replaced with a second solar-oriented temple, a so-called 'henge' monument, today known as Durrington Walls. \nIt appears that the stones of the original horseshoe were deliberately pulled out of their sockets and were then pushed over on their sides and deliberately buried under the southern and western part of the newly constructed earthwork embankment which linked up with the natural (and potentially already artificially scarped) curved ridge to form the roughly circular Durrington Walls henge. \nIt is the most dramatic example yet discovered of the precise moment a site changed from a pre 'Stonehenge main phase' tradition to a 'Stonehenge solar phase' one. \nNormally, in Britain and around the world, such religious changes are only known from much later periods when historical records were kept - such as the change-over from Roman sun worship to Christianity or from Arabian paganism to Islam or from Catholicism to Protestantism in Reformation Europe. \nIn prehistory, the nature and moment of religious change is not usually so visible and capable of being so well understood and appreciated. The buried 'standing stones' discovery at Durrington Walls is therefore likely to prove an exception to that rule. \nThe geophysical survey work at the site and elsewhere in the Stonehenge landscape has involved archaeologists from three academic institutions - Bradford and Birmingham universities, and Austria's Ludwig Boltzmann Institute. \n\"The discovery of the stones under Durrington Walls changes in a dramatic way our understanding of the development of the Stonehenge landscape,\" said Professor Vince Gaffney of Bradford University. \n\"The burying of the stones in Neolithic times almost certainly represented significant social and ritual change,\" he said. \nThe 'buried stones' discovery under Durrington Walls henge will almost certainly trigger geophysical investigations at other henge sites to try to ascertain whether their often massive earthworks also conceal hitherto unsuspected buried 'standing stone' systems. \nPrime candidates for such investigations may include the great henge monuments at Avebury and Marden (both in Wiltshire) and Mount Pleasant (in Dorset) \nInterestingly, archaeologists have long suspected that Avebury and some other important Neolithic henge sites probably had pre-henge ritual structures. \nThe 'solar cult' religious revolution, that the dramatic change at Durrington Walls represents, appears to have been part of a much wider societal transformation in which ceramic styles changed and feasting and pork consumption was introduced on a grand scale. \nThe discovery of the long-buried standing stones of the Durrington horseshoe is part of a wider archaeological survey of the Stonehenge landscape, led by Professor Vince Gaffney of Bradford University and Professor Wolfgang Neubauer of the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute in Vienna , which, over the past five years, has revealed the existence of more than 20 previously unknown Stonehenge era monuments. \nThe sites of some of these newly discovered monuments - mainly shrines and sacred enclosures - are within just half a mile of Stonehenge itself. \nTheir discovery reveals that Stonehenge did not exist in splendid isolation but lay at the heart of a series of other smaller religious or ceremonial structures. \nA more detailed analysis of these newly discovered monuments is now likely to shed new light on the nature of society at the time of Stonehenge. A huge set of Sarston stones that make up Stonehenge A huge set of Sarston stones that make up Stonehenge \nOne major new monument discovered very near to Stonehenge was a 20 metre diameter ring of large wooden posts. Ground penetrating radar was used to detect the holes in which these timber uprights had originally stood. \nThe survey - known as the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project - has also discovered thousands of new details about literally hundreds of previously known Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments within Stonehenge's sacred landscape. \nOver the past five years, some five square miles have been surveyed using ground penetrating radar, magnetometry and electro-magnetic induction. archaeologist", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T13:45:21.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
