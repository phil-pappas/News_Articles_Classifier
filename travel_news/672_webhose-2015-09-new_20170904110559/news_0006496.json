Credit: PA The figures show that the Welsh capital is the 5th worst for train commuters having to stand due to overcrowding during morning travel.\nLondon is the busiest city, with more than a quarter of commuters on the morning rush hour trains have to stand due to overcrowding.\nThe figure of 28% for travel between 8am and 8.50am is the highest for any city and up 6% on 2011.\n\"We have seen record-breaking numbers use the railways in the past year, with 1.7 billion journeys completed in 2014, more than double the number recorded a decade ago. I know how frustrated customers are with overcrowding, and I expect the rail industry, including operators, to continue to develop innovative proposals to meet the capacity challenge head on.\"\n– Claire Perry, Rail Minister The First Great Western are pushing out new trains on their lines. Credit: PA The city outside London with the highest number of passengers was Birmingham, with 39,000 passengers on board trains arriving into the city centre in the morning peak.\nThe other cities looked at were Bristol, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield. The figures are for a typical autumn weekday in 2014.\nThe number of standing passengers is expressed as a percentage of a train's standard class maximum load. (For the morning rush hour period, 08:00-08:59):\nLondon: 28% Manchester: 20% Birmingham: 16% Leeds: 15% Cardiff: 11% Newcastle: 9% Sheffield: 8% Bristol: 5% Liverpool: 5% Nottingham: 5% Leicester: 2% \"We are constantly playing catch up here and it seems that the amount of new trains that are always being announced and then re-announced are not going to catch up with the rise and rise of passenger numbers on the network. If you look at any individual line, for some passengers there is little hope of an improvement in the near future because obviously there are certain lines that are getting new trains, like Great Western and Thameslink, but for other lines there is no prospect of extra trains in the medium term. So some passengers will certainly have to to grin and bare it whilst the number of new passengers wanting to join the line will continue to rise and rise and rise.\"\n– Bruce Williamson, Railfuture Campaign Group The DfT said that the overall level of crowding across the 11 cities has increased, with it being clear that much of the growth has taken place on routes that are already very busy.\nLast updated Thu 10 Sep 2015 Travel Cardiff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T01:10:34.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
