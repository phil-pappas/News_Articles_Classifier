Plus the diverse beauty of the landscape, sprinkled with silvery-green olive groves, lush vineyards, and medieval castles will literally take your breath away. Do I really want to let this rabbit out of the hat?\" She said: \"Let me think about it overnight.\"Janice, though, is not quite the first American to venture out of the confines of Rome or Venice or Florence - this secret destination almost escaped anonymity in 2013, when David Rosengarten wrote a rave report for Forbes Magazine that found its way into a number of global glossies.Titled \"Italy's Greatest Gastronomic Treasure, Emilia-Romagna\", the article highlighted the \"Big Five\" in the Emilia area: Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena and Bologna. But unfortunately for Romagna, the author stopped short.Said Janice \"If Rosengarten was that enamored by the foods of Bologna, I think he'd totally flip out with what's happening over in the Romagna side of the culinary equation.\"And there you have it - the Eastern half of Emilia Romagna, between Venice and Florence, guarded by the Adriatic Sea and sheltered by the Apennine mountains lies Romagna itself - Janice's treasure-trove holiday secret.In one article Janice highlights just one of the many local chefs that concentrate on local, seasonal ingredients, she writes about locally-owned hotels and vineyards and local people, passionate about their homeland that benefit from tourism.The fact is that in Romagna the value-chain is incredibly short and mass tourism is unknown, which makes prices truly affordable, quality astonishingly high and hospitality impeccable.Read the second article with 20 pictures HERE: Wholesalers, agents - follow the Christmas star to the green heart of Italy: HERE Valere TjolleSpecial offers on sustainable tourism info HERE \nTuesday, September 1, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:16:53.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
