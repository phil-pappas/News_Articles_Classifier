These seat actuation systems are automated and have the ability to let the passengers adjust their seating position as per their comfort level. The market is expected to grow during the forecast period.\nThe increasing disposable income is creating a demand for air travel globally. This demand is in return creating a demand for commercial aircrafts. The seat actuation systems are one of the essential components of aircraft cabins. Hence, the demand for seat actuation systems is increasing globally. Furthermore, the rising awareness for ergonomic seating is also driving the growth for aircraft seat actuation systems market. The modern seat actuation systems are designed to provide the correct seating positions for passengers in order to avoid lumbar pains over long haul air travel. The ergonomic seat designs also help the pilots to operate the aircraft efficiently. In addition, the ergonomic seat designs include a skull and lower back support. The need for ergonomic seat designs is fuelling the growth for aircraft seat actuation systems market. Furthermore, the rising demand for premium air travel is also creating a demand for advanced seat actuation systems. The demand is attributed to the rising disposable income in emerging economies such as India and China.\nHowever, the concept of low frill airlines is acting as a restraint for the market. The low frill airlines are focused providing economical air travel by increasing the passenger capacity and decreasing the in-flight comfort and facilities. This concept is hindering the demand for seat actuation systems in aircraft. Moreover, the cost and maintenance of an aircraft is high which discourages the vendors from placing bulk aircraft orders.\nThe technological innovation in the aircraft seat actuation systems is expected to act as an opportunity for the market during the forecast period. The seat actuation systems are anticipated to become lighter with less noise and low maintenance in future.\nThe analysis of the aircraft seat actuation systems market has been done in terms of sales revenue (USD million). The report has been analyzed over a forecast period from 2015 to 2021. In addition, the report includes the drivers and restraints pushing and pulling the market. Furthermore, the opportunities that can affect the market in future have also been discussed.\nRegionally, the market has been segmented in to North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of the world. The regional estimation has been done in terms of revenue (USD million). Furthermore, the aircraft seat actuation systems market has been categorized into types which include economy class, economy plus class, business class and first class. In addition, the market has also been segmented by mechanism of the actuators into linear and rotary actuators. Moreover, the aircraft seat actuation systems further been classified by actuator types into electromechanical actuation systems and other types of actuation systems.
