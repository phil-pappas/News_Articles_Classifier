Samantha Kudeweh, 43, was killed by the zoo's male Sumatran tiger called Oz. No further details have been released about how exactly it happened. • Tiger mauls tourist in Phuket tiger park • Drunken visitors pouring beer over tigers and disturbing animals at London Zoo lates The city officials have decided that there is \"no reason\" to euthanase Oz. \"Although there is an inherent risk for zoo professionals who manage big cats like Oz, there is no wider ongoing risk\" Lance Vervoort Lance Vervoort, Hamilton City Council’s General Manager Community, said he was \"a significant animal for his species\" and vital to the breeding programme. He said: \"Although there is an inherent risk for zoo professionals who manage big cats like Oz, there is no wider ongoing risk,\" \"This is our call, and the decision on Oz rested solely with us.\" The zoo is now investigating the case, and they have not confirmed whether Ms Kudewah had authorisation to be in the enclosure with Oz. Officials have confirmed that the widely held view is that Oz had acted in line with his natural instincts. Ms Kudeweh had more than 20 years of experience working in zoos, and was second-in-charge at Hamilton Zoo. Haminton Zoo is closed until Thursday, and it is unclear whether Oz will go back on show to the public.
