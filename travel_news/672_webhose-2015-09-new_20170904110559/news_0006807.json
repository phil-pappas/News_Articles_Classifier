The up-gauge will be applied to a seventh flight per week on the 1 December 2015.\nBy replacing the A330-200 with the Boeing 777-300ER, Emirates will be adding a capacity increase of 50% to the route, which launched in November 2011. The new aircraft will also introduce the Emirates First Class Suite, a first for the route, plus 42 lie-flat Business Class seats and 310 spacious Economy Class seats.\nAs the only airline to offer First Class Suites from St Petersburg, Emirates is bringing a new level of comfort and quality to the market, previously unavailable from St Petersburg on a commercial airline.\n“Since 2011, when Emirates launched flights to and from St Petersburg, we have carried over 500,000 passengers on the route. Counting these figures alongside our double-daily flights to Moscow, takes the total to over 3.6million passengers travelling on Emirates to and from Russia in the 12 years of operation, making it an important market not only for Emirates, but for Dubai as a destination,” said Thierry Aucoc, Emirates’ Senior Vice President, Commercial Operations – Europe and Russian Federation.\n“Operating these flights to and from St Petersburg on a 777-300ER brings consistency to the Russian customer. Whether travelling from St Petersburg or Moscow, they will be confident that the level of experience they receive is in line with what is expected from Emirates.”\nOn board the Emirates Boeing 777-300ER, passengers in all three cabins can enjoy more than 2,000 channels of the latest movies, TV shows and music from around the world on the award-winning ice inflight entertainment system, all while enjoying specially created gourmet cuisine served by Emirates’ multi-lingual cabin crew. As with all Emirates flights, passengers travelling on the route will be able to accumulate Skywards miles and benefit from a generous baggage allowance of 30kg in Economy Class, 40kg in Business Class and 50kg in First Class.\nEmirates’ flight EK175 departs Dubai International Airport at 09:20 and arrives in St Petersburg at 14:35. The outbound flight EK176 departs from St Petersburg at 16:35 and arrives in Dubai at 23:45.\nFrom Dubai, Russian passengers are able to easily connect to Emirates’ vast network of destinations in Asia and beyond, including the new service to Bali, the Thai island of Phuket and exciting cities in Australia. From Asia, Middle East, Australia and Africa, St Petersburg is just a short stop in Dubai away, offering a convenient option for business and leisure passengers to connect with Russia.\nSource:- Emirates", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:21:39.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
