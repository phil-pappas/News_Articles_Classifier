This is particularly true when buying smaller amounts. Apart from the poor exchange rate, there are also charges and hidden commission to take into account. So what can you do to make smaller transactions a better deal? Regular transfers There is a simple solution if you frequently transfer money abroad to pay bills or take a monthly income from the UK. This is a regular payment plan, available from most specialist foreign currency brokers, which gives you an exchange rate close to the wholesale market rate. You need to set up an account with a broker first. There's no fee to take out a plan and you choose the payment schedule. The rate is fixed when you take it out for up to 12 months or longer. Alternatively, you can set up a rate alert with your broker to contact you when it reaches your chosen level to make a transfer. Online transfers can be made at any time. Ask the broker what its minimum amount is – often as low as £100. Bank cards These are good for expats who travel widely. MasterCard and Visa give credit and debit card companies a rate close to the wholesale price but most card issuers add 2.75 per cent onto the rate and a fee of £2-3 for ATM withdrawals. While credit cards from the Nationwide, Post Office, Lloyds, Halifax and Saga don't have a foreign loading fee, the Halifax Clarity card is the only one that doesn't charge for cash withdrawals either. Santander's Zero card is also fee-free, but not open to new applications at the moment. • Transferring cash abroad to snap up a house?

The Norwich & Peterborough debit card, however, has no loading fee worldwide and no cash withdrawal fees if you're prepared to switch banks. Metro bank's debit card is also fee-free but only in Europe. Prepaid cards For those who want to fix the rate and not be tempted to overspend, prepaid cards are the answer. You are given a rate for the currency, such as euros or dollars, on the day you load it onto the card. But with global prepaid cards, you load them with sterling and get the exchange rate on the day you use it abroad. They use the MasterCard or Visa system and you can compare exchange rates on sites such as Moneysupermarket.com . Check the fees for applications, cash withdrawals and replacements and look out for special offers. FairFX ( fairfx.com ), for instance, waives its £9.95 card fee when you load £50 in a currency onto it while the Post Office card has no fee for loading any of the seven foreign currencies it allows. Nearly all prepaid cards charge £1-2.50 each time you withdraw cash but the Moneycorp ( moneycorp.com ) Explorer card and the Caxton FX ( caxtonfx.com ) currency card are fee-free. Mobile phone apps Prepaid card companies are introducing smartphone apps to make it easier to reload them, but there are new specialist apps launched this year by Revolut ( revolut.com ) and WeSwap ( weswap.com ). These let you send money via the app and spend through their prepaid MasterCard loaded with funds from your bank account or debit card. Revolut promises to give you the interbank exchange rate with no loading and no fees for the first year. WeSwap also uses the interbank rate but adds at least one per cent to it. You can put dollars, euros or pounds on their cards. You can convert the pounds to 80 other currencies with Revolut and 14 with WeSwap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T00:45:31.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
