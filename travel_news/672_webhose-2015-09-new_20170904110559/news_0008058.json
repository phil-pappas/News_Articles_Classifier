(NYSE:THO), the sole owner of operating subsidiaries that, combined, represent one of the world's largest manufacturers of recreational vehicles, today announced that its Heartland Recreational Vehicles, LLC subsidiary (\"Heartland\") has selected Nampa, Idaho , as the location for its new manufacturing facility to produce the company's popular Heartland line of travel trailers. Once completed, Heartland expects to use the manufacturing facility to expand production for West Coast markets. The total estimated investment is approximately $11-12 million for the 248,000 square-foot facility, which is expected to employ approximately 120 new workers and begin production in the first quarter of calendar 2016.\n\"We have been looking for the right opportunity to expand our presence on the West Coast, and this new investment in a Heartland complex in Idaho represents a meaningful investment in the organic growth of our business,\" commented Bob Martin , Thor President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Expanding production in the west is expected to enhance our competitive position as we will now be able to offer some of the most in-demand products of Heartland more timely and efficiently and at a lower cost to dealers on the West Coast.\"\nChris Hermon , President of Heartland commented, \"Now is the time for Heartland to make a bold move to acquire a large production complex in the west, as the travel trailer market is booming. We have many great dealers who, I suspect, will be overjoyed at this news. Our operational team is fantastic here at Heartland, and we are ready to grow and conquer the demands of being one of the few premium builders with a nationwide presence.\"\nThe facility will initially employ approximately 120 people and house one production line along with a lamination line to support production. The complex will initially produce one of Heartland's lightweight laminated product lines and Cruiser RV's laminated travel trailers will be added when the second production line is established. Since the complex is located on 25 acres, Heartland will have additional opportunities for future expansion to effectively serve the needs of its western dealers.\n\"I really believe the timing of this acquisition is key as we kick off the Elkhart Open House this week. This is the time of year when dealers make decisions on which strategic partners they want to work and grow their businesses with,\" said Coley Brady , Vice President of Sales at Heartland. \"We want to solidify our partnerships with those strong dealers who can take advantage of our supply chain through the new West Coast facility. This addition costs millions to do, but I see a huge 'win-win' opportunity for both our dealers and Heartland to grow our businesses to a whole new level.\"\nAbout Thor Industries, Inc.\nThor is the sole owner of operating subsidiaries that, combined, represent one of the world's largest manufacturers of recreational vehicles.\nThis release includes certain statements that are \"forward looking\" statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
