To qualify and receive a designation in the program, facilities must implement numerous environmental practices in communication and education (customers, employees and public); waste reduction (reusing and recycling); water conservation; energy efficiency; and indoor air quality.\nThe state has praised the Fort Myers resort for efforts that include installing a trash compactor and cardboard separator, adding an electric car charging station, implementing nature programs with an on-site master naturalist, planting 10,000 plants on the beach to prevent erosion and hosting a water conservation community event. Pink Shell also recycles all paper, glass, cardboard, electronics, cooking oil and batteries while boasting a green team that meets once a month to discuss ongoing initiatives.\n“We are extremely passionate about improving our environmental footprint and constantly looking to find new eco-friendly practices to utilize,” said Alicia Wiley, general manager of Pink Shell Beach Resort & Marina. “We are proud of our 2 Palm status and hope our efforts serve as an inspiration to other properties in the area and beyond.”\nLocated along 12 beautiful acres across the Gulf of Mexico, the Fort Myers Beach hotel is dedicated to protecting its surroundings. In addition to the sugary-white sand beach, the property boasts a 41-slip marina on Estero Bay, ranked in the Top 25 Places to Tie Up in North America.\nWhen not enjoying the stunning outdoors, travelers are invited to retreat to one- and two-bedroom condo-style suites that incorporate eco-friendly practices while providing all of the comforts of home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:07:44.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
