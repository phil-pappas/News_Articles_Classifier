After working in broadcast journalism for a decade in Australia, Michael left Sydney to travel the world indefinitely and write about his discoveries. \nI have spent a fair bit of time in Germany in the past couple of years and every time I go there, I discover something new. It’s a country that I may have dismissed as a bit mundane once upon a time but I have now come to love the diversity. From the history, to the food, to the industry, to the modern culture – Germany has so much depth. It’s more than castles and sausages (although I am quite fond of both those things as well!) \nYou may remember that last year I did an epic trip through Germany to see all of the country’s World Heritage Sites while travelling on the Deutsche Bahn trains. It was exhausting but also so rewarding to get such a wide view of the heritage in such a short time. ( If you’re interested, you can see all of the places I visited here .) \nSo I’m really pleased to let you know that for the next week I am going to be back in Germany – but this time I’m going to be exploring just two places in a lot more depth. Get ready for Hamburg and Nuremberg and my investigations into the German traditions of these two cities. \nIn preparation for the trip, I’ve put together a rough plan of some of the things I want to see and do. However, I’ve intentionally left some spare time in both cities so that I can listen to you – my readers – and get some suggestions. Have you been to either of these cities before and found something cool? Do you live there and think you know a secret spot? If so, I would love to hear from you! \nIn the meantime, here are a few of the things I have on the itinerary already. \nIn Hamburg, I will be: Visiting Michel, the most important baroque church in the north of Germany Getting up early to go shopping at the local fish market on a Sunday morning Walking through the bridges and canals of the city (many more than Venice!) Exploring the Schanzenviertel region – which I’ve been told is the new hipster part of town Trying some beers at the Holsten brewery Learning about the port city’s history at the Maritime Museum \nAfter a few days in Hamburg, I’ll be getting the train down to Nuremberg. \nIn Nuremberg, I will be: Meeting craftspeople at the ‘Handwerkerhof’ to see the traditional methods of leather workers, glass cutters and gingerbread makers. Visiting the house of the 16th century artist, Albrecht Dürer, which is now a museum Spending an evening at the ‘Aldstadtfest’, which is the largest old town festival in Germany Climbing up to the city’s Imperial Castle Learning how the locals make the Bavarian pretzel the traditional way Acting like a kid at the Toy Museum \nSo, as you can see, there is a lot to do in both these cities and I feel like I’m only scratching the surface with these plans. I’m hoping that even more things will present themselves once I’m there and exploring. \nBut, as I mentioned, I would love to know your suggestions. So please comment below or drop me a note on one of my social media networks with your ideas and I’ll do my best to try them out myself! \nTime Travel Turtle is supported by the German National Tourist Board but the opinions, over-written descriptions and bad jokes are his own.
