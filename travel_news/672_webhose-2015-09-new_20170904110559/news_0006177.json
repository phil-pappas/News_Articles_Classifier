From just 500 hotels in its database, U Xplor now includes over 300,000 hotels worldwide, in addition to land transfers, tours and packages. \n\nWith these functions in place, “travel (consultants) are starting to partner with us\" and new verticals such as flights may be added in the future, said Techico.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:24:26.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
