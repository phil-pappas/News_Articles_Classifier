Bringing more than 30 years of hospitality experience to the role, Ms. Corrigan will be overseeing all aspects — from operations to revenue strategy to sales and marketing — of the 300-room Magnificent Mile hotel, the first in Chicago to join Starwood’s prestigious brand, The Luxury Collection Hotels & Resorts. “Kim’s extensive expertise and leadership, combined with her personal commitment to excellence, will guide her in achieving high levels of success for the newly rebranded Luxury Collection hotel,” said Michael George, CEO of Crescent Hotels & Resorts. “Her creative mindset makes her the perfect addition to bring The Gwen’s art, and 1930s-themed branding, to life.”\nMs. Corrigan recently served as General Manager of the historic Blackstone Renaissance Hotel in Chicago. During her three-year tenure there, she was recognized by the Illinois Hotel & Lodging Association as the 2014 Hotelier of the Year for the Greater Chicagoland Area. Prior to her move to the Midwest, Ms. Corrigan resided in Denver, where she spent eight years as General Manager with various Hilton properties, including The Curtis in downtown, and almost a decade in Atlantic City, NJ, where she earned executive-level experience in operations at iconic casino properties, such as the Trump Taj Mahal, Merv Griffin’s Casino Hotel, and Bally’s Grand Casino Hotel.\nA graduate of Cornell University’s School of Hotel Administration, Ms. Corrigan began her role at The Gwen just prior to the property’s September 1st transition to Starwood from the Conrad Chicago. Perfectly situated in the heart of the Windy City, The Gwen is housed within the landmark McGraw-Hill Building on the Magnificent Mile. The reimagined icon is adorned with sculptural panels created in 1929 by pioneering artist Gwen Lux, the hotel’s namesake. Embracing her artistic spirit, The Gwen celebrates the energy and glamour of Chicago in the Art Deco era, with details such as a Prohibition Porter mixologist and an Artist’s Table dining experience.\nSurrounded by premier shopping, The Gwen, poised to deliver a new level of luxury, is connected to The Shops at North Bridge, providing enclosed access to upscale retailers, such as Nordstrom Michigan Avenue, Stuart Weitzman, and Hugo Boss. It is also minutes from The Loop, Chicago’s business district, as well as world-class dining, and exciting cultural and entertainment hotpots.\nFor more information or to be one of the first to experience The Gwen, visit http://www.TheGwenChicago.com or call (312) 645-1500.\n###\nABOUT DIAMONDROCK HOSPITALITY COMPANY\nDiamondRock Hospitality Company is a self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) that is an owner of a leading portfolio of geographically diversified hotels concentrated in top gateway markets and destination resort locations.
