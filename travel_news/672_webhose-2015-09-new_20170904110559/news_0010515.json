This was part of the airline's award-winning Soar with Reading program. Since July, the public actively participated in an online competition by casting their votes for one of five cities -- Detroit, Houston, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, and New York -- to determine which community would receive 100,000 new children's books. Nearly 1.3 million online votes were cast and Detroit beat out the other cities receiving 48 percent of the votes to bring books to children in its city who need them most. Books will be distributed in 2016. \nThe announcement comes after a recent survey found that 95 percent of American adults agree that children should have their own books at home. The survey also found that 85 percent of U.S. adults agree that access to age-appropriate books in communities cannot be provided by schools alone. \nLast year, JetBlue commissioned a study with education expert Dr. Susan Neuman and discovered book deserts in communities across the country. Book deserts are found in communities where children and their families have little or no access to purchase age-appropriate books. Results from Dr. Neuman's 2014 study show that in low income communities, the majority of the children had limited access to purchase books to keep versus in middle income communities where access was plentiful. In Michigan's Hamtramck neighborhood, there was only one age-appropriate book available for every 42 children, while in the University District there was only one book for every 11 children. \n\"Our customers responded loud and clear that they wanted this book donation to go to Detroit. The Motor City received nearly half of the online votes,\" said Icema Gibbs, JetBlue's director of corporate social responsibility. \"After hearing staggering statistics that children in Detroit had little access to purchase books, the community responded so we could help replenish this book desert. The best way to provide a lifelong love of learning is during early childhood, we are simply providing the means and access. We are making a direct impact by enabling the children of Detroit to build their own libraries at home and take pride in book ownership.\" \nEarlier this summer, to combat the lack of books in Washington, D.C., JetBlue launched a pilot program that distributed free children's books via vending machines to local residents. Washington, D.C. was chosen to launch this program after Dr. Neuman's study found that the Anacostia neighborhood of D.C. is a large book desert, leaving residents little or no access to purchase age-appropriate children's books. JetBlue's book vending machines were placed in select locations in the community and allowed children to receive books, free of cost. \nSince its launch in 2011, Soar with Reading has donated more than $1,250,000 worth of books to kids across the country. Soar with Reading was designed to encourage kids' imaginations to take flight through reading and to get books into the hands of kids that need them most. JetBlue is proud to have partnered with Random House Children's Books and Magic Tree House author Mary Pope Osborne as well as celebrity spokesperson Victoria Justice during the 2015 program. \nFor additional information on the online Book Battle or Soar with Reading program, please visit SoarwithReading.com . \nABOUT JETBLUE AIRWAYS JetBlue is New York's Hometown Airlineâ„¢, and a leading carrier in Boston, Fort Lauderdale - Hollywood, Los Angeles (Long Beach), Orlando, and San Juan.
