(AP) -- Authorities say passengers were briefly evacuated from a terminal of the Nashville International Airport after a suspicious bag was discovered and a bomb robot determined it wasn't a threat. Airport spokesman Minh Le told The Associated Press the unattended bag was discovered by an airport worker about 10 a.m. Sunday. He said the terminal by the ticketing counter was shut down for about two hours, and that people in the terminal went outside for about 20 minutes. Le said the bomb robot took the bag to an employee parking lot, examined it, and determined it posed no threat. He said it's unclear who the bag belonged to. He said there was a short delay for departing flights, but incoming flights weren't affected. The terminal reopened around 1 p.m. Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T18:37:06.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
