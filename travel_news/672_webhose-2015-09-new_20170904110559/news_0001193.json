This year marks 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, 25 years of reunification after 29 years of division, 25 years of ‘one Germany’.\nWhen the Berlin Wall came down on 9 November 1989, Germany was transformed overnight. East Germans were free to enter West Germany, and a new era of unity began. The reunification was ratified on 3 October 1990, a date which has been marked as a public holiday in Germany ever since.\n25 years have now gone by and that momentous occasion must not be forgotten.\nAs in previous years, a huge festival will be held at the Brandenburg Gate. The celebrations will include live concerts, street theatre, comedy acts and, of course, an extensive choice of food and drink.\nEvery year, a different region hosts the main programme for the Day of German National Unity. In 2015 it is the turn of Frankfurt, where events will be taking place on Römerberg square, in the Zeil pedestrian precinct and on the river Main as part of a city street festival running from 2 to 4 October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:12:50.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
