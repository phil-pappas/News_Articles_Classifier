The airline was already serving Tehran.\nEmirates’ five weekly flights, operated by a combination of a three class and two class configured A330-200, will help further stimulate the vital trade ties between the UAE and Iran. The UAE is Iran’s biggest non-oil trading partner. It is also Iran’s biggest source of imported goods, worth more than AED93.5 billion in 2014.\nIn turn, Iran exports goods to the UAE valued at AED3.8 billion, according to the UAE ministry of economy.\nThe new service to Mashhad, Iran’s second largest city and one of its most economically vibrant centres will not only enhance trade ties with the UAE, but will also introduce travellers to Emirates’ vast route network, opening up new opportunities to connect efficiently with destinations in the Middle East, Europe, Africa and West Asia through our world-class Dubai hub.\nBy boosting air transport links from Mashhad to the increasingly connected world economy, we are contributing to the growth of international trade, tourism and investment.\nEmirates’ services to Mashhad will depart on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from Dubai as EK967 at 04:10 arriving at Mashhad International Airport at 07:00. The return flight, EK968 will depart Mashhad International Airport at 08:45hrs arriving in Dubai at 10:45.\nEmirates commenced services to Iran in 1990 with two flights a week to Tehran. Since then, Emirates has carried seven million passengers to and from Iran. It now operates four daily flights to the capital city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:58:14.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
