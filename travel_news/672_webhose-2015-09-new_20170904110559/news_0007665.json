Now you can. \nProbably not since the release of Steven Spielberg's Jaws has the Great White Shark been so much in the news for all the wrong reasons. Even some of Australia's wiliest surfers have confessed to looking over their shoulder for fins since Mick Fanning's legendary encounter. \nNonetheless, the ocean's arguably toughest predator remains fascinating and last year an estimated 9000 tourists headed to Port Lincoln in South Australia to see the awesome creatures in their natural habitat. That's the Neptune Islands at the mouth of the Spencer Gulf, the only place in the country where you can cage-dive with them.

Robert Lang \nThe Aqua Sub features a submersible glass viewing area where tourists can see sharks move about. \nBetter still, he serves drinks and nibbles on board â€“ that's the \"bored\" bit taken care of, should the sharks not turn up. \"It's amazing how people can be entertained with wine, food and good stories,\" says Waller, whose stories include the fact that \"All the action stuff in Jaws, was actually shot at this site\". \nA self-confessed \"dreamer\", Waller, who does not use bait and berley to attract the animals and is committed to \"preservation and understanding\", took more than five years to develop his idea at a cost of about A$1 million. \nSince launching it earlier this year, he says the response has been good and growing steadily. He's confident as the message gets out, that will increase. Robert Lang \nCome face to face with great white, beer in hand. \nAs an eco-operator, he warns however: \"This is a wildlife experience. We provide access to sharks - we don't promise sharks.\" Ad Feedback \nOh well, there's always the bar. \nThe full day experience costs A$395 (NZ$439) for adults and A$285 for children five-15.
