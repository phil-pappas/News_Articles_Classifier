Earlier in the afternoon on the aforementioned dates, guests can watch the designer sketch, sew and create garments.\n“We design for women on the rise,” says Littlejohn. “Imminent Rise is a brand for an upcoming generation of women that do not hold themselves to social molds. We believe in feminine strength and therein lies our passion for how we design the line.”\nMade in the USA, Imminent Rise set out to build a brand around easy to understand and easy to wear garments. Littlejohn’s journey began with her signature Orion Tank, a silk basic that is effortlessly comfortable and chic. As the company grows, the brand continues to build on high-end essential apparel with a fashion forward mindset.\nIn 2015, Four Seasons Hotel Denver hosted its first artist-in-residence in January, contemporary Western artist Duke Beardsley. In June, the Hotel welcomed fashion photographer Jody Zorn, who conducted photo shoots during happy hours in EDGE Bar, as well as an underwater video shoot.\nSource:-Four Seasons Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:53:41.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
