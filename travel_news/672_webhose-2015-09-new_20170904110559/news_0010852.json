Recently recognized as the Best Insurance Telematics Product 2015 by Telematics Update, the Zubie solution delivers rich data and analytics to help make driving safer, easier and less expensive. The Zubie service uses its always-on cellular-based technology to connect a car to the cloud via the Zubie Key, a device that plugs into the car's On-Board Diagnostics port.\nThe new capabilities announced by Zubie today will be available for users and enterprise partners in the coming months and consist of three components:\nThe Place Match feature uses driving patterns to automatically identify frequent destinations such as work, home, school, etc.\nThe Driver Match feature uses past driving activity and phone-based user location to infer the driver for each trip in a multi-car, multi-driver family or small business fleet.\nSpeed analytics incorporate actual posted speed limits from roadways ranging from highways to local roads, and provide visual summaries of major and minor speeding relative to the limits.\nThese added elements offer a more complete picture of driver activity. This in turn enables more accuracy in assessing driver behavior, and provides insurance carriers as well as enterprise fleet customers with more valuable insights into risk and driver safety.\n\"Context is an important dimension in taking telematics and usage-based insurance to the next level,\" said Tim Kelly , Zubie Chief Executive Officer. \"Having deeper information on driving behavior – such as the actual speed limits of the road where a speeding event may have occurred, or the nature of the trip – provides a more complete picture for consideration by our insurance partners and other enterprise clients.\"\nZubie is committed to ensuring driver privacy and control over their data. Driving data is only shared with insurance partners with the customer's explicit consent if the customer chooses to participate in an insurance program or offer.\nAbout Zubie\nZubie is a connected car service focused on making driving safer, easier and less expensive for business enterprises including automotive, insurance, and mobile/telecom operators, as well as consumers and small businesses. The company was formed in 2012, and is headquartered in Charleston, SC , USA.
