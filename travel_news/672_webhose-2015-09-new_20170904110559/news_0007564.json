The things we’ve done here in Slavonia, we will do in southern Croatia if it comes to that. Preparation is all-important. I don’t want to spread panic, but everything is ready.” \nMontenegro’s government also said it was preparing for migrants to arrive in the country, which has borders with Albania to the south, Kosovo and Serbia to the east and Croatia to the north. “With the latest developments at Hungary’s border [with Croatia] and the pressure on Macedonia and Serbia, it is possible that many refugees will choose to go through . . . Montenegro,” the AFP news agency quoted the government as saying. \nMontenegro \n“Taking into account that 5,000 migrants are arriving in the western Balkans on a daily basis, Montenegro is preparing capacities to take in some 2,000,” the government statement said. \nSuch a route towards Austria and Germany would be longer, harder and involve crossing more frontiers than the migrants’ current northerly path, but developments in the crisis have proved hard to predict, with some states changing border policies and even temporarily banning vehicles from neighbouring countries. \nSince Hungary sealed its border with Serbia a fortnight ago, triggering brief clashes between migrants and Hungarian riot police guarding the security fence, more than 65,000 asylum seekers have entered Croatia from Serbia. \nIf Hungary were to prevent them being transported further, through its territory to Austria, Croatia’s transit facilities could quickly be overwhelmed. Croatia could then seek to prevent migrants entering from Serbia, or it could direct them westwards towards Slovenia, a fellow EU member that borders Austria. \nMr Orban suggested during a visit to Austria last Friday that he would not seal Hungary’s fence with Croatia before consulting and seeking support for the move from neighbouring states and the United Nations. \nIn an easing of regional tensions since Friday, Croatia and Serbia lifted restrictions on each other’s vehicles entering their territory, and Hungary removed spools of razor wire from its border with Slovenia. \n“The key is that everything goes smoothly on Hungary’s side. [Hungary] is still receiving and transporting” migrants to the Austrian border, Mr Ostojic said. “The situation is under control.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T00:32:35.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
