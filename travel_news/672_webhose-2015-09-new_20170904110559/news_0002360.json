In their annual ' The State of the UK's Relationships ' report, Relate, a service that offers counselling, support and information for relationships, found that 18 per cent of couples who had been together for over 15 years sent flirtatious or sexually suggestive messages to one another. Despite many relationship counsellors believing sexting could negatively impact relationship, respondents to the survey said sexting with their partner had positively impacted their own. The report looked at what people thought strains on their relationships were, revealing that while money worries are one of the key challenges couples face today, there does appear to be \"cautious improvement\" for older people in particular. While 54 per cent of over 65s said financial troubles were a \"top strain\", in 2014 this figure was at 69 per cent. Drinking too much puts a strain on relationships Photo: Alamy Alcohol dependency was also named as one of the top strains on relationships for couples over 65. 18 per cent identified it as a major strain, compared to just 10 per cent of those under 65. The reports authors said: \"This is in line with statistics showing that the number of older people admitted to hospital with mental and behavioural problems as a result of alcohol has significantly increased over recent years.\" Age was revealed to have an impact on the importance we attach to our sex lives. 74 per cent of those aged 65 and over said they hadnâ€™t had sex in at least a month, and 48 per cent said a good sex life was not important to them. However, the authors argue that a dwindling appetite for sex may not be solely because of age but also \"the increased likelihood of living with long term health conditions in later life.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T10:18:47.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
