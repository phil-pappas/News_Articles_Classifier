Served over stewed lentils with harissa, chickpea hummus and grilled pita, this hearty vegetarian dish packed intense flavor. \nNext door at Bud & Alley’s Pizza Bar , Executive Chef Phil McDonald serves up wood-fired pizzas with fresh, seasonal ingredients. “The menu we have in summer is not the menu we’ll have in the fall,” he said. \nIn late summer, figs picked just outside the restaurant are combined with goat cheese and sherry shallot vinaigrette for backyard fig bruschetta. The farmer’s market pizza offers grilled local eggplant with charred corn. Paired with a side of Italian flat green beans prepared with olive oil and garlic, it’s a delightful way to eat your veggies. \nFarming since 2005, Charles Bush and Shueh-Mei Pong, owners of Dragonfly Fields , are former restaurateurs themselves. Now, in addition to cultivating vegetables from their 17 acres of land north of Defuniak Springs , they pick, wash, clean, pack and deliver Italian green beans, tomatoes and arugula once or twice a week to Bud & Alley’s and to other chefs and retailers they supply in South Walton and Okaloosa County. They also sell to the public at the Seaside Farmers Market . \n“There are so many good restaurants now on 30-A. Growers and producers have stepped up to meet the demand,” Rauschkolb said. “It’s a group of people who like and support each other, and we all share in the value of the region. Those relationships, plus the bounty of the Gulf at our fingertips, are good for visitors and good for everybody.” \nOur quest for farm-to-table goodness continued westward at FarmStand in Grayton Beach . \nBenton introduced proprietor Renee Savary, a Swiss-born woman raised in France, who also owns and operates Twin Oaks Farm , a 94-acre certified organic farm in Bonifay . \nSelling organic eggs, chicken, and other goods, FarmStand serves breakfast and lunch daily. “Our food is fresh every day according to what we have,” Savary said. \n\nOn this visit, a frittata made from Twin Oaks Farm eggs, ranked the number one organic eggs in the nation by the Cornucopia Institute, is served with green beans from Dragonfly Fields. Dessert is fresh fruit clafoutis, a flan-like dish prepared with peaches. \nSavary is passionate for sustainability and organic farming, describing the methods she uses to raise and process her thriving stock of chicken, duck, and sheep. \nThe residents include around 50 large black hogs, which she affectionately refers to as Le Cochon Noir de Bonifay. \n“I believe in maximizing what you get from each animal,” she said. \nAlys Beach Executive Chef Kevin Korman works closely with Savary, visiting her farm and hand-selecting products for the heritage pork and chicken dishes on his farm-to-table menu at Caliza Restaurant in Panama City Beach . \nIn the Destin area, Benton recommends Tim Creehan’s Cuvee Destin . She notes Jackacudas Seafood & Sush i for its use of Fish Trax to identify diners’ fish entrees by type, as well as when, where and by whom it was caught. \nIn Pensacola , the award-winning Jackson’s Steakhouse and Executive Chef Irv Miller have set the bar with a fine dining menu of grass-fed beef and fresh seafood since 1998. \nWith an accomplished career spanning three decades in Northwest Florida restaurants, Miller has forged relationships with farmers and fishermen throughout the region. His forthcoming cookbook, “Panhandle to Pan: Recipes and Stories from Florida’s New Redneck Riviera,” highlights growers and producers who define the farm-to-table spirit. \nMariCarmen Josephs, owner and chef of Carmen’s Lunch Bar , personally visits the Palafox Market in Downtown Pensacola each Saturday to select produce. Flora Bama Farms is another supplier. \nAt lunch, Carmen’s kale salad and soup of the day are good bets for sampling seasonal vegetables and fruit. Josephs makes a gazpacho with all local ingredients, including tomatoes, bell pepper, cucumber and corn. \nPhoto by Chef MariCarmen Josephs \n“I knew early on that fresh, quality produce would be a part of what makes Carmen’s attractive to our customers,” she said. \nOffering many gluten-free options, Josephs incorporates more local ingredients into the nightly tapas menu. Homemade pepper jelly served over savory goat cheese cheesecake with crostini on a bed of arugula has been a popular item, she said. \nAnother dish, spiralized golden and green zucchini can be sautéed with homemade pesto made from local basil or served with Carmen’s Italian meat sauce with pork. \nPhoto by Chef MariCarmen Josephs \nJosephs recently introduced a creamy local eggplant dip with basil-manchego-almond pesto. Garnished with roasted red poblano peppers and lemon zest, it is served with freshly toasted crostini. \nOther restaurants to try on this westernmost end of the Panhandle include Type , Restaurant Iron , The Fish House and Atlas Oyster House . Offering waterfront dining in the heart of Pensacola, both Fish House and Atlas participate in the statewide Fresh From Florida On The Menu program, offering produce grown by Florida farmers and seafood caught in Florida waters. \nVisit FreshFromFlorida.com and localharvest.org to find more local farm-to-table restaurants, farmers’ markets, u-pick farms, co-ops, and events. \nPhotos by Andrew Wardlow for VISIT FLORIDA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T10:47:41.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
