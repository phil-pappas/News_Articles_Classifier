Travel Oregon is on a sales mission in Australia encouraging travel agents to share their vision of exploring the state in a healthy way via bicycle, surrounded only by fresh air and wide-open spaces.\nAs the first state in the USA to create bike friendly trails for tourism exploration, Oregon is home to an endless network of scenic byways that pass by rugged coastal headlands, deep old growth forests, high desert vistas and deep river canyons.\nThe gateway city of Portland adopts a cycling lifestyle with specific amenities like bike repair and designated places to park or store bikes when touring the city. Bike lanes are clearly marked on most major commuter routes, traffic signals are optimised for safer and faster bike travel, buses are equipped with bike racks and bikes are welcome aboard trains and streetcars.\nPortland also lays claim to a number of crafty bike makers including Joseph Ahearne from Ahearne Cycles, who is visiting Australia with Travel Oregon to share the state’s vision exploring it on two wheels in the great outdoors.\n“Bikes are healthy, meditative and useful, and they bring out the best of people’s personalities, said Ahearne.\n“They help build community and promote environmental awareness, and they can help people explore the world around them in a way that is interactive and participatory.\n“Exploring Oregon’s epic landscapes offers expert and beginner cyclists’ unimaginable diversity and travelling by bike gives you the chance to meet locals across diverse cultures.”\nAhearne will join Travel Oregon, Travel Portland, Washington Country Visitors Association, Mt. Hood Territory, The Jupiter Hotel, Pedal Bike Tours & Hawaiian Airlines for a tourism networking night with craft beer, wine and local cuisine in Sydney on Monday 21 September from 5.30pm till 8pm at The Locals Tap House 122 Flinders Street, Darlinghurst.\nTour operators Adventure World, Creative Holidays, Scenic, Evergreen, Driveaway Holidays, Ski Max and Intrepid Travel who all sell Oregon will have representatives attending and the invitation extends to retail agents wanting to learn more about the cycling state and all its tourism attributes. There will also be a competition for one visitor to win a hand crafted Oregon bike worth $5000 throughout the day at an Oregon Pop Up Activation Site at Martin Place from 11am to 3pm.\nJoin in on the celebration Monday 21 September, 5.30pm at The Locals Tap House at 122 Flinders Street, Darlinghurst, where Travel Oregon will have craft beer, wine and food event finishes at 8pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:34:59.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
