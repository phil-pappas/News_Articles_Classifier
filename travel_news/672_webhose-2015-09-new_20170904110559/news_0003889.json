The adventure comes to a climax in an explosive finale. Adults can even volunteer as “extras” and be part of the action. And, while Indiana Jones negotiates traps, villains and epic obstacles, a director explains the movie magic. Out of Africa: go giraffe spotting on an Animal Kingdom safari Learn the difference between stunt doubles and stunt actors, and watch demonstrations of fight routines, learn how to safely throw and take punches, fall from tall buildings, and wield whips in the midst of complex action sequences.

Here, enchanting puppets invite tots to sing, dance and play – just watch their faces as Mickey, Minnie and friends from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and their favourite Disney Junior characters, including Sofia the First, Doc McStuffins, and Jake and the Neverland Pirates, appear on stage to kick off the fun. Disney’s Animal Kingdom is the largest animal theme park in the world with more than 1,700 animals across 250 species.
