The Sanchaya’s estate manager Anshuman Narayan announced the appointments of Giacomo Turzo and Fay Gauna Lugue to the roles of food and beverage director-executive chef and director of sales and marketing respectively after extensive recruitment processes. \nSpanning 30 years, Turzo’s career saw him heat up the frying pan in a number of Michelin star restaurants in his native Italy, including two Michelin-star restaurant La Frasca in Castrocaro Terme, before he broadened his horizons in restaurants, hotels, casinos, VIP clubs and private yachts, in Turkey, Egypt, Singapore and Thailand. With a proven track record of more than 28 years in the hospitality and service industry, Lugue has worked in a variety of Singapore-based roles, including director of sales and marketing and director of business development positions for Accor Hotels, Banyan Tree Hotels and Resorts, Gallery Hotel, Sofitel Palm Resort and Vacation Singapore DMC. “Turzo and Lugue are seasoned professionals who bring rich and diversified experience to the table,” Narayan said. “They will no doubt further propel The Sanchaya’s aspirations to live up to an unsurpassed level of hospitality and attention to detail thanks to their talent and strong work ethic.” At The Sanchaya, Turzo helms the entire food and beverage operation in addition to his role as executive chef, just as he had at Phuket’s Panwa Beachfront Resort and Rayavadee Resort in Krabi. “Turzo has immense experience in Mediterranean and Asian cuisine, he is incredibly versatile catering to events ranging from weddings and corporate meetings to a picnic for two or private barbeque, and he’s an inspirational leader who pays particular attention to mentoring and developing his team as well as exceeding his guests’ wildest expectations,” Narayan said. Before joining The Sanchaya, Lugue’s most recently worked as chief operating officer of last-minute booking app In2Nite Singapore, where she was in charge of group operations, online marketing, contracting, loyalty programs and affiliate partnerships. “Lugue has been recognized as one of Singapore’s Top 40 Professional Filipino Entrepreneurs and for good reason — she exceeds at everything she puts her mind to,” said Narayan. “Her marketing savvy will continue to see The Sanchaya leave its stamp on the luxurious and bespoke hospitality and service industry.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:35:54.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
