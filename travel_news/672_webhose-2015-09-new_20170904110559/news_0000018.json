Report Score: 16 RomseyKeith 1:21pm Wed 23 Sep 15 \nI get that the Mobility Scooters can be a hazard on the pavements and dangerous on the roads, but seriously, Thomas Lewis Way is a long, straight stretch of road. How can you miss a mobility scooter if he was riding along the road? If he was crossing the road, and didn't look before venturing out, maybe that'd be a cause. Or if the driver was distracted by phone, or was going too fast to react in time to the obstacle, that could be a cause. Maybe the driver was drunk, mounted the curb, and knocked into the scooter sending into the middle of the road. As is often the case though, the trial by public opinion has begun and instantly found fault with the scooter user. We weren't there and did not see the collision occur. Speculation is futile. I wish all involved a speedy recovery.

Report Score: 2 eurogordi 1:26pm Wed 23 Sep 15 \nToo many people use mobility scooters these days ... most of whom are just obese and could do with the exercise. No one needs a licence or insurance to use one, yet many users drive on the main highway or at speed on the footpath. Once upon a time users had to have a genuine medical need before being allowed to use a mobility scooter. Now anyone can buy one and use it immediately. As others have said, ban the mobility scooter completely or, at the very least, only allow those with a full medical assessment and diagnosis use them.
