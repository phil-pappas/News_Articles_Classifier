The only five-star Luxury Included ® resort in Barbados designed exclusively for couples, this decadent beach-front paradise in the spirited St Lawrence Gap area features romantic suites with private plunge pools and English Guild-trained butlers. On a romantic break here, you can sail and scuba dive, stroll along the beach through lapping water or sip cocktails at the swim-up bar, wander through tropical gardens or relax to a calypso beat. At sunset, you can listen to the sounds of monkeys playing in the palm trees or enjoy the beachfront whirlpool in a special under-the-stars ambience created by the fire pits. Sandals Barbados opened in January 2015 following a $42 million (£27 million) refurbishment and no detail has been overlooked in fitting out the three unique villages, which comprise 280 opulent accommodations, 11 restaurants, seven bars and three swimming pools. From the moment you arrive to be greeted with champagne, cool towels and a Caribbean singing welcome, you will discover that with over 30 years’ experience of all-inclusive resort hospitality, the Sandals team knows exactly how to conjure magical opportunities within a tropical haven. Even on a couple’s holiday, it is good to know you can pursue separate activities only to plan an intimate rendezvous later Like an evening massage for two… The Red Lane ® Spa therapists specialise in natural botanical treatments with a focus on “connection, time and love” – in addition to the whole range of European-style massages, facials, body wraps, scrubs and rejuvenating pampering, all with Sandals' signature tropical twists (treatments at cost). Even on a couple’s holiday, it is good to know you can pursue separate activities only to plan an intimate rendezvous later. For some, heaven comes in the form of a sunbed with beach bar service. Others will prefer plenty of action: deep-sea fishing, surfing, zip lining, snorkelling, kiteboarding, sailing, hiking, and more. As the newest resort, Barbados has become the must-try destination for the discerning legion of Sandals aficionados. Here, the lauded “gourmet discovery” dining options bring an array of new tastes to guests with 11 different types of cuisine: from Caribbean seafood to regional Italian, French-style patisserie café to the Soy Sushi Bar, Butch's Chophouse – a New York-style steakhouse – plus the Bombay Club, Sandals' first ever Indian restaurant. Accommodation is distinctly glamorous. A Tranquillity Soaking Tub on the balcony is a lovely indulgence. Typically you’ll find mahogany furnishings, a four-poster king-size bed, flat-screen television, iPod docking system, fully-stocked bar and his and hers plush robes. Bathrooms include a dual control walk-in shower, capacious circular tub, and double basins; and a patio which offers a hot tub to soak up the view towards the meeting of the seas. There are 14 room categories, but if you’re dreaming of the ultimate romantic suite, consider either an Ocean Village beachfront set of rooms or a Crystal Lagoon swim-up suite, which gives you access to the largest private “river pool” on the island. Both come with a patio Tranquillity Soaking Tub and the discreet attentiveness of your own friendly butler. It more than exceeds expectations. • For more information on Caribbean holidays, visit sandals.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:42:28.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
