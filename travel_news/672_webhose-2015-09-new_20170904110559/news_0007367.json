This was carried out as a precaution after a passenger attempted to board without the correct documentation. EasyJet's staff alerted the local police,\" said easyJet in a statement. \nAccording to easyJet's website the flight to Tenerife departed at 8.45am, which was one hour and 15 minutes behind schedule. \nThe airline said the safety and security of its passengers and crew was its \"highest priority\" and apologised for any inconvenience caused by the delay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:38:29.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
