Providing a brief change of focus, on 4 October, will be the next American football game in the NFL International Series, when New York Jets and Miami Dolphins meet at Wembley. Commercially, at least, a comparison between the sports is instructive. Rugby union has spread from its Commonwealth roots and 20 nations will contest the World Cup, which has brought £85m of infrastructure investment to the UK, supporting 41,000 jobs and delivering economic benefits that are estimated by EY, the accountants, to be nearly £1bn. Yet such figures pale in comparison with American football – one of the world’s most lucrative sports, despite its popularity and revenue being focused almost entirely within North America. The NFL has invested an undisclosed sum to make Wembley an NFL-ready venue Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, plans to double the sport’s revenues to $25bn (about £16bn) by 2027, through lucrative sponsorships from multinational brands including Visa, Pepsi and Budweiser. In particular, he has indicated that the NFL is ready to invest more aggressively in the British market, with London seen as ripe for having its own franchise within five years. “Our next step is something we’re going to have to evaluate,” he says. “When I go to London I am continually amazed at the breadth of knowledge of our game and the experience provided at Wembley. “We will be continuing to invest in that marketplace and find ways to engage those fans even more deeply. I’m optimistic they will respond positively.” According to consultants Deloitte, a London-based NFL team could generate direct economic impact each season of £102m a year from eight home games, including £70m from ticket sales, based on a total of 600,000 fans attending, and an extra impact on total spending in the wider UK economy of £96m. So can American football crack the UK market? The 2015 International Series is entering new territory, with three games staged in London for the first time. Of the teams featured – Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, New York Jets, Kansas City Chiefs and Buffalo Bills – the last three are playing their first regular-season NFL games at Wembley. Dan Jones, head of Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, sees the NFL International Series as “a valuable addition” to London’s major sporting events calendar and believes that a franchise in the capital would further reinforce its status as one of the world’s top cities for sport. With the growth of on-demand TV, sports events offer the holy grail of large live audiences The NFL is keeping quiet on when that might arrive. But it has invested an undisclosed sum to make Wembley an NFL-ready venue, and agreed a ten-year deal to hold at least two games a year at Tottenham Hotspur’s planned £400m stadium from 2018. The NFL’s international committee has also explored the possibility of bringing a team to the Olympic Stadium by 2017. Although progress is being made in building an overseas audience, “fan acquisition does not happen organically abroad where American football is not a top-of-mind sport,” says Jeremy Porter, lead strategist at Definition 6, the social media consultancy. Definition 6 has been asked by the NFL to raise engagement with UK fans and aggressively increase its UK fan base during the 2015-16 season. With a 30pc rise and engagement records for the NFL’s social media accounts, it seems to be working. One Vine post announcing the line-up for the 2015-16 NFL London games received more than 1.1m plays. With the world’s rugby appetite soon to be sated, perhaps this season could be the one that the NFL finally goes global. Rights figures make great viewing The NFL is huge in the United States. With at least four hours’ programming for each nationally televised game, live coverage contributes 16 hours a week to US TV network schedules in prime viewing slots. With the growth of on-demand and time-shifted viewing eroding traditional TV advertising models, sports events offer the holy grail of large live audiences, and that is reflected in the NFL’s rights collection, which is the largest in the US. It is divided between several different networks locked into deals until early next decade and is valued at a reported annual aggregate of more than $4bn (£2.6bn). The biggest bucks are reserved for the Super Bowl. Rights cost a reported $300m last year, when 30-second TV advertising slots sold at up to $4.5m, making it the sport’s prime event in more ways than one. – Chris Haimendorf US equities portfolio manager, Standard Life Investments Read more: • Potential is delivered by a collective approach • Cutting-edge technology moves sport into the digital age • Investment predictions within the sports industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T20:44:13.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
