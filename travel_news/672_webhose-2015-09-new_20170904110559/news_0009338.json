In case you're not sure of the exact age bracket, the baby boomers are - and we'll use the American definition adopted by the report - those aged roughtly between 55 and 70 today. The report claims that there is a general perception that the baby boomers have 'ruined everything' . But they want to prove us wrong - quite rightly. Photo: Alamy So, because there are lots of things that people think are true about baby boomers, the Alliance have laid these out for all to see, and helpfully debunked the rumours. Mainly, because the baby boomers, just like anyone else, are not a homogenous group. Not all are the same - so don't lump them together. Thus, the myths and legends of the baby boomers - blown out of the water. MYTH: The baby boomers got a free education In actual fact, just over 13 per cent of those aged 65-69 have a university degree, and among 55 to 64 year olds, just under 20 per cent have a degree. It is true that in the 60s and 70s university fees were significantly lower than today , but fewer people took part, which means that as a whole, the baby boomer generation has far less experience of university that that of their grandchildren. Photo: PA MYTH: The baby boomers can look forward to security in retirement thanks to their generous pensions The report states that \"nearly 2 million people aged 55-64 do not have any private pension savings \" which makes the whole shebang about pensions wrong. Using data from the Wealth and Assets Survey 2010-12, the report found that 28 per cent of Britons aged 55-64 have no private pension wealth at all. Photo: Alamy MYTH: The baby boomers bought cheap housing and are now sitting on a fortune It would be wrong to think that all baby boomers owned their homes . In fact, among households headed by someone aged 55-64, just under half own their property outright. A quarter are renting, too - so Generation Rent is not just limited to 20-somethings in Islington. Photo: Alamy MYTH: The boomers are spending their children's inheritance Not all grandparents , and those of a certain age have a never-ending pot of money for which to give their relatives. According to the report, just over half of people aged 50 and above are \"relatively confident\" of being able to leave more than Â£50,000 in inheritance . Photo: Alamy MYTH: Compared to other age groups, baby boomers are especially selfish and self-interested people According to the Taking Part Survey, conducted by the Department for Communities and Local Government, 50 to 64 is the peak age bracket for people wanting to take on caring responsibilities . The report states too that there are 3.3 million volunteers aged 45-64 in England alone, which doesn't add up to self-interest, if you really think about it. Photo: Alamy MYTH: Baby boomers who have retired spend their life taking cruises and playing golf Tosh, says the report. \"People in their 50s and early 60s are no more likely to be planning a cruise than younger people.\" The report found that those in the 55-64 age bracket were actually three per cent less likely than their 25-34 counterparts to be planning a cruise . telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:24:34.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
