This year, one of the deserving organizations was the Bedford Texas Police Department . A city organization dedicated to the protection of its citizens and those who visit, this department also goes above and beyond the call of duty to not only serve and protect, but to educate as well. It is for these and other reasons that Ultimate Excursions chose this community organization as the beneficiary of their gift this year.\nBedford is a mid-size community of just over 50,000, located between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas . The department, made up of over 80 officers, 56 civilian personnel and a strong volunteer base, includes more than uniformed services, but also operations and technical services as well, many of which are highly trained, including the SWAT Division.\nOne of the many services offered to residents of the community by the Bedford Police Department is the Vacation House Watch Program. An easy way for residents to feel comfortable while away from home, residents can simply fill out and submit a form to police which tells the location of the home and the dates/times they will be away. During their time away, uniformed officers will monitor their home, offering peace of mind. Other services and programs, including the CPA and the Repeat Victimization Unit, further serve as a way for residents to feel safer and more informed.\nIn a time when many police departments are dealing with negative PR, Ultimate Excursions would like to personally thank the Bedford Police Department for all they do for their community.\nUltimate Excursions is a leader in the resort marketing and development industry. With over 75 years of combined experience, Ultimate Excursions has proven to be effective.
