Life in India is in the streets, it’s about people going about their daily lives, cooking, manufacturing, selling, and it all happens just outside your hotel. “It’s full of life and colour. The way the locals dress, the food they eat, the flowers and garlands they take to the temples – it’s all so vibrant.” And one trip is never quite enough, as SDL is all too well aware. Datia Palace is beautiful; the famous British architect Lutyens who designed New Delhi called it ‘the most perfect palace in India’ “No matter how many times you visit India, there’s always something still to discover. It gets under your skin – you start to understand it, and you want to learn more. “So we make sure we offer the classic routes, Agra, Delhi, Jaipur, Rajasthan, which are ideal for first-timers, but we venture away from the beaten path too. “My favourite route is one I introduced last year, Beyond the Taj, which is actually based on a route I took 30 years ago as a backpacker. Some of the places I remembered so fondly are hardly visited at all by other tourists.” When asked for an example, he explains: “Datia Palace is beautiful; the famous British architect Lutyens who designed New Delhi called it ‘the most perfect palace in India’. “I saw it all those years ago and thought it was exactly that – perfect – and yet it’s only one of the thousands of beautiful sights India has to offer.” Watch the video interview with Holiday Hunter Stuart Douglass-Lee>> For the latest travel news, sign up to the fortnightly Saga Navigator newsletter , or follow @SagaHolidaysUK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:27:36.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
