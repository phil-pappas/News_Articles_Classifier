Maybe you did go, but had no ATV to ride once you saw how much fun people were having on them. Maybe lack of hook-ups and other amenities was not your cup of tea. Well, Russ and Lori have your cup of tea to tell you about. Glamis North Hot Springs Resort has it all for folks who want off-road adventures and a well maintained RV park to stay in. With its location close to Niland, Glamis North Hot Springs Resort services all types of campers. They have spaces from the smallest tents to the very largest of recreational vehicles. This is great for people who bring their ATVs with them, having plenty of room to load and unload. The Resort also has plumbed restrooms, pit toilets, and showers available. 30 and 50 amp electricity is available, sewer hook-up’s and free WiFi. For your pleasure, a large heated swimming pool and spa are situated in the resort as well. Enjoy one of the natural mineral pools for a good, healthy, refreshing soak. A well-stocked store carries many of your necessities that you may have run out of or even forgotten for the trip. It happens. Glamis North is the starting point to the Bradshaw Hills. Right up against the Chocolate Mountains, there are many destinations to ride to. Steve’s ATV Rentals has a wide variety of well-maintained ATV’s for any riding style. Shifter, automatic clutch, small cc to large cc, Steve’s will hook you up with the best and safest ride to fit your style. Explore the trails. For short ride or novice riders, ride to the Old Miner Cabin. It’s a four to five hour ride into the beautiful mountains. The Bradshaw Trail will take you through breathtaking mountains and canyons all the way to the Colorado River. A great trip for the whole family is a ride to the bat caves. Where else are you going to see something like that? It’s an 18 mile round trip that is trail friendly for the family. The Oasis has a habitat of a rare species of fish and these wild tress that grow sideways. Take water, travel in groups, and never exceed your riding experience level. There are many other destinations to ride to, but they are day rides for the more experienced riders. We are approaching a prime time in California weather to visit this beautiful part of California. October temperatures average 94 degrees during the day and 60 at night. If you are visiting over a weekend, a must try is Sassy’s Café at the resort. Sassy’s is closed on weekdays. Relax in the pool or Roman Tubs. The resort has a \"$10 Genius Sunday\" (non-holiday) offer. Stay for a three-day weekend on a non-holiday weekend for half the price of a standard three-day weekend. It’s a good deal. Glamis North has 18 places where you can get wet (no kidding). The mineral hot spring unloads healing mineral water out of the ground at 160 degrees. The resort cools it down just right and then runs into two therapeutic pools, 14 hot tubs, and the large pool that is for the whole family. What is extra cool about this; NO harsh chemicals in the water! There is no chlorine messing up your body in these pools baby. There is only refreshing, warm, natural water. This water really makes you feel good. Do you have family or friends that don’t own an RV but would be excited about staying here? No worries. Cabins and lodges are available as well. The team here is great. Folks even whistle while they work. For those interested, a \"Kamper Church,\" non-denominational, casual dress, old fashioned gospel music, is each Sunday from 10:30–11:30 a.m. Maybe a strange Russ and Lori editorial placement for this next line, but the store has a wide variety of micro and popular beer labels to choose from. Something for everybody’s taste! So, Let’s Get Rollin!
