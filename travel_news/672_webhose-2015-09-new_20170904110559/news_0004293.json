Most of the work will take place during the day with materials being removed during the night so as not to disrupt passengers. The project will last around six weeks, with the exits onto New Station Street remaining open at all times.\nHelen Dawson, station manager for Leeds, said: “Taking away these units will allow more light into the concourse and helps take out some bottlenecks that can build up at the station doors during peak times. The space vacated by the shops will also make waiting in the concourse a more comfortable experience for those checking the timetable boards or waiting to meet friends, family and colleagues.”\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T19:32:28.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
