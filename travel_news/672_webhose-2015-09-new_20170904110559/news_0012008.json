However, not every single holiday goes according to plan and tens of thousands of holidays result in serious complaints. These complaints include serious illness, and holiday accommodation not being what was advertised,\nOut of all the holidays that turn into a holiday from hell, only a small percentage of people make a complaint. Out of those complaints, only a small amount end up in legal action being taken against the holiday company. The reason for the low number of complaints is due to consumers not being sure how to make a complaint. According to Sun Holiday Reviews, even fewer people understand they can seek legal advice for holiday complaints.\nGeoff Tims from Sun Holiday Reviews Magazine said: \"It is important when a person has a complaint about their holiday they seek to claim compensation.”\nAccording to Sun Holiday Reviews , consumers are happy to receive the first offer of compensation from a holiday company when a complaint has been made. This is normally a money off coupon off their next holiday. The average amount according to the travel magazine is around £50, which is not enough when a holiday has been spoilt.\nThe Sun Holiday Reviews magazine is recommending to holidaymakers who have a serious complaint about their holiday to seek legal advice. By seeking legal advice, they are then able to receive a real compensation amount that will make up for their holiday from hell.\nTo learn more about Sun Holiday Reviews, please visit http://www.sunholidayreviews.com/\nAbout Sun Holiday Reviews\nSun Holiday Reviews is an online magazine that brings consumers all the latest news on holidays and discounts.\nMedia Relations\nChantelle Ellis\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
