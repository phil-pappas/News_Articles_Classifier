However my summer days in Dubai have given me and my younger brother Faisal some very special memories, as we visited different shopping malls to watch our favourite shows during Dubai Summer Surprises.”\n“I have truly enjoyed the Looney Tunes shows in City Centre Mirdif and City Centre Deira as well as Kids Fashion Fest at The Dubai Mall. I also went there to see Jaden and Willow Smith and got the chance to take a picture with them. I was at CITY WALK too and enjoyed my time at the video game stations at the “Pixels in the City” attraction. In addition, I visited Modhesh World multiple times where I had the most amazing time ever. This year my family decided to stay in Dubai and take the opportunity to enjoy the emirate as tourists and not residents,” he added.\n3-year-old Saeb and 4-year-old Hamza Maaita and their mother too have had the chance to share fantastic moments together while shopping and watching the superb stage shows at Dubai’s leading shopping malls. Saeb said his wish came true when he watched the Power Rangers Supermega Force and later also took photos with shows’ characters and then some more with his family at the Power Rangers Museum.\nResident Jasem Mohammed Al Kanar who has come to Dubai with his family from Ras Al Khaimah, said: “We love coming to Dubai, as the kids enjoy their time watching different comic shows and playing fun contests and games, while my wife and I shop and take advantage of the big sales. It is sad that DSS and this summer are coming to an end; it was indeed a delightful season for my family.”\nEnjoyable experiences for Tourists\nTourists from around the world too expressed their love for the city of Dubai which is home to people from various cultures and nationalities, and is always offering them the best of fun attractions. Laila, a Jordanian national who lives in KSA, who is among the numerous tourists visiting Dubai for DSS, said: “My experience of DSS has been incredible. I am very happy with my visit. I was left enthralled by the number of shopping malls in Dubai, with each one featuring its own unique architecture, design, and feel. They also offer the best brands and a beautiful variety and options for shoppers like myself.”\n“I loved Ibn Batutta Mall the most and I shopped for many items by popular labels and brands that were on a sale of up to 75%. I grabbed bargains on electronics, home items, and all the essential back-to -school supplies for my kids. Accessing the shopping malls is easy in Dubai with public transportation and then grabbing so many superb deals has truly completed my shopping experiences in Dubai. At these shopping malls, one can spend an entire day of shopping, relaxing, and dining without feeling a minute of boredom. The summer season in Dubai is beautiful, with so much to do indoors,” she added.\n“I’m truly amazed by all the exceptional services available to visitors in Dubai. This city is packed with quality attractions and an array of memorable experiences for one and all,” she concluded.\nMohammed Makram Al Mushly, a Syrian tourist, said: “It’s our first time visiting Dubai and we enjoyed the shopping bargains in the malls. It gave us the opportunity to pick up everything we needed and more.”\nHis wife Fatouma Ahmad Shawakh, added: “We are in love with Dubai. It’s a city full of life, love, happiness spread across the city. This is also my first time visiting Dubai and experiencing all the attractions of Dubai Summer Surprises. We have decided to come back to Dubai for the forthcoming festivals.”\nDreams come true at Dubai Summer Surprises\nThe 18th edition of Dubai Summer Surprises has also been a season of life-changing moments for many visitors who walked home with amazing prizes and rewards as part of the numerous DSS retail promotions offered across the city at numerous shopping destinations.\nOne of the many lucky winners was Emirati national Fardan Al Fardan who said that this edition of DSS has indeed been a season of surprises for him as he won two fantastic cars as part of the Shop Together. Win Together (His and Hers promotion) run in collaboration with Dubai Shopping Malls Group. He added further that memories of this year’s edition will remain with him and his family forever as it is his first time ever winning a grand prize like this.\nSharing his excitement, he said: “I took my family to BOXPARK and we had coffee at one of the cafes and we received a coupon for the promotion which I filled in with my daughter Al Reem’s name. In about a week, I received a call announcing that I have won two Infiniti cars.”\n“This festive season of Dubai Summer Surprises has become an integral part of everyone’s calendar and summer plans. We effortlessly associate it in our minds as a period of big sales, shows, prizes and I wish it could last longer so we can continue to experience these joyful vibes throughout the year,” he concluded.\nAnother winner of the ‘His and Hers’ promotion, Noora Al Hallak, a Palestinian resident, said: “It’s a superb surprise that I could not even dream of in my entire life, especially since I have never won any prize before. I was shopping with my husband at Arabian Center and we bought many clothes, perfumes and then dined, and let the kids enjoy in the play area. We redeemed our shopping spree of around AED 2,000 with coupons and in about a week, we received a call that we have won two Infiniti cars as part of the His and Hers promotion.”\n“I still can’t believe that we won and I am as thrilled today as I was when we had been announced the winners. I wish everyone gets the opportunity to win during DSS to turn their wishes into a reality. Thank you DSS for making our dreams come true,” she concluded.\nBusy season for shop owners\nEnsuring brisk business across the retail segment, DSS 2015 has not only resulted in increased footfall at big shopping outlets, but has also led to brisk sales at smaller kiosks dotting the walkways of numerous shopping malls.\nIslam Ali Mohammed, owner of one of the kiosks selling accessories at The Dubai Mall, said: “DSS has attracted shoppers and visitors to the shopping malls and to our kiosks which has helped increase my sales enormously especially with our 50% sale offer.”\n“It has been a super busy season for us in terms of business sales and customer traffic.\nDespite the long hours and late night shifts to ensure that our customers can enjoy the convenience of shopping through late hours, we are very happy with the outcome and the increased sales.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T14:00:21.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
