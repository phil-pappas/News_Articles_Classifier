We welcome new leadership and a new direction that recognizes the value of frontline workers and the full potential of our airline,\" said AFA International President Sara Nelson. \"Oscar Munoz has an impressive business record, including at other highly unionized companies. AFA looks forward to working with him to conclude contract negotiations and return our airline to premier status in the world.\" \nUnited Airlines, Continental Airlines and Continental Micronesia merged five years ago on paper, but the airline is still maintaining separate flight attendant operations and has yet to conclude a flight attendant merged agreement. AFA recently filed for federal mediation in order to bring the negotiations to a conclusion. \n\"We believe a fresh perspective will be healthy for United Airlines in all areas, especially where labor relations languished under previous leadership. New leadership has the potential to improve the flying experience for our passengers and insure Flight Attendants and other frontline workers are recognized, engaged and included in the success of our airline,\" said Nelson. \"We look forward to discussing a bright future with our new CEO.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T04:09:47.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
