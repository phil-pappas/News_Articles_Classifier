Walk the shores where Spanish explorers first set foot hundreds of years ago. History mingles with modern life in St. Augustine . The beaches of the St. Augustine area are both secluded and unspoiled with more than 40 miles of scenic, well-preserved coastline. Parks in the area give you the choice of parking off the beach and walking, swimming or sunbathing along the miles of immaculate coastline, or parking right on the sand and enjoying a dip in the surf near one of several staffed lifeguard towers. Guana River at the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve Headquartered north of historic St. Augustine, GTM Research Reserve is a 74,000-acre preserve that features more than four miles of beautiful, undeveloped coquina sand beach lined with 35-foot dunes. The park has three public beach access facilities, consisting of parking lots and associated dune crossover boardwalks. You can enjoy swimming, sunbathing, surfing, fishing, shelling and other traditional beach activities. When you’re done with the beaches, you can hike, bike or ride horses more than nine miles of nature trails and old service roads that wind through the hammock, scrub and flatwoods in the interior portion of the reserve. Make sure to stop by the Environmental Education Center to learn more about estuaries through exhibits and scavenger hunts for children.

To complement its ocean access, Usina Beach features shaded picnic areas, fire rings, and restrooms.

The main beach attraction is the Vilano Beach Fishing Pier. Beach access is available at Surfside Park, where you can enjoy a picnic shelter, restrooms and showers.

At low tide, the sand is hard packed and perfect for a bicycle ride. Folks can bring their own or rent one from the concession. St. Augustine Beach St. Augustine Beach, located on the southern end of 18-mile Anastasia Island, features wide, beautiful beaches.

Butler, bought this small stretch of land between the Matanzas River and the Atlantic Ocean, and for many years, it was the only beach between Jacksonville and Daytona that welcomed African-Americans.
