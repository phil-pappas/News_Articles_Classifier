PUBLISHED: 03:54, Wed, Sep 16, 2015 | UPDATED: 07:35, Wed, Sep 16, 2015 GETTY Sex could cure a phobia of flying, according to a a therapist \nBut it could be that the secret to getting over a crippling fear of flying is as simple as a night of good sex. \nAnxious passengers should ditch sleeping pills and hypnosis for sex before take-off, according to a therapist and ex-pilot. \nTom Bunn insisted he has had clients who have forgotten about their anxiety after having sex the night before.

Here's five things you should know before... \nThe former US Air Force pilot who now counsels air travellers with phobias said a new study on chronic and post-traumatic stress may prove the theory that sex can lower a person's stress levels before taking off. \nMr Bunn who founded SOAR, a programme to help people with a fear of flying, said: \"I had a male client who said he had a fear of flying for seven years. \n\"Every time he flew he was totally miserable, except for one time when, before he came back from a business trip, he hooked up with someone. \n\"He said they didn't get any sleep. They made love all night long and he dragged himself out of bed onto the airplane and had a perfectly anxiety-free flight.\" \nMr Bunn's theory has been backed in a new study which explored why trauma victims are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress if they have previously suffered chronic stress. \nIt found that animals that underwent chronic stress prior to a traumatic experience are more likely to consolidate traumatic memories - which can trigger anxiety. \nResearchers also found that blocking that type of memory formation may offer a new way to prevent post-traumatic stress. GETTY Many struggle with fears of flying when jetting off abroad They made love all night long and he dragged himself out of bed onto the airplane Tom Bunn \nThe research by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was nothing to do with sex or anxiety caused by flying. \nBut Mr Bunn believes it suggests that passengers who have chronic stress in their lives are more vulnerable to develop a fear of of flying based on post-traumatic stress when something such as turbulence occurs. \nPublished in Science Daily, the MIT study found that it may be possible to prevent traumatic memories from etching or weaken them after they have formed with drugs that interfere with serotonin - which accelerations memory consolidation in the brain. \nMr Bunn said sex produces a chemical called oxytocin which shuts down the part of the brain where serotonin helps consolidate fearful memories. \nWhile he said sex won't help all jet-setters get off the ground, the therapist said it may cure some anxious flyers.
