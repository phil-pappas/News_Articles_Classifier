(AP) â€” Glacier National Park rangers have euthanized a black bear that had developed a habit of visiting developed areas for food.\nGame managers took the action on Thursday near Lake McDonald Lodge in order to ensure public safety.\nThe bear was first observed on Aug. 31 feeding on mountain ash berries near buildings in the Lake McDonald Lodge developed area.\nOver the next 10 days, the bear revisited the area despite repeated attempts by park rangers to haze the bear away from the area with rubber bullets and bean bag rounds.\nOn Sept. 10th, the bear was observed peering into windows at the employee dorm. Park staff captured and relocated it to a remote area.\nBut the bear returned to the Lake McDonald area, breaking into a vehicle to obtain food.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T01:22:26.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
