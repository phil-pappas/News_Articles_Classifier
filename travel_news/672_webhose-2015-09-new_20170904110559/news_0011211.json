This e-commerce B2B trading platform allows Chinese manufacturers, sellers, and products to reach customers around the world. This includes the recently popular self-balancing scooter.\nElectric self-balancing scooters feature a skateboard-like board to stand on, accompanied by two wheels, one on each end of the device. The scooters rely on the rider's body movements to control the direction and speed of the scooter. They use a sensor system to detect direction and a motor to power the scooter. If you want to go faster, simply lean your body forward. If you want to slow down or stop, lean backward.\nThis new form of transportation has been taking the world by storm. Since May of this year, the sales of self-balancing scooters have peaked as the tech has become a new trend in America, China , and other countries around the world.
