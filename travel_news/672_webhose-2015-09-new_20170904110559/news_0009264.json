Picture: PUXLEY MAKGATHO Related articles Informal sector cries out for policy leap ON THE MONEY: The perils of information overload THE management of informal trade in the Johannesburg inner city is in disarray, and regulatory practices are restrictive, inconsistent and enforcement-orientated rather than developmental, according to a new report.\nLaunched by the Socio-Economic Rights Institute (Seri) on Tuesday, the report documents the challenges experienced by informal traders in the CBD, stating that such problems are due to a mismatch between policy and practice.\nThe report follows running battles between the city and informal traders from September to October 2013 when about 7,000 street traders had their goods confiscated without prior notice in what was dubbed Operation Clean Sweep.\nAccording to the Seri researchers, since then informal traders have still been experiencing abuse from the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) whose officers still confiscated their stock despite a Constitutional Court ruling that declared the practice to be illegal.\nThe Seri report argues there was an alternative way to manage informal traders.\n\"A more inclusive approach, one that starts with recognising traders whether they are licensed or not will do more to contribute to inclusive regeneration than any interventions designed to eradicate informality. This approach will also accommodate more equal access to the economy that an authentically world class African city must surely provide.\"\nJoburg’s Informal Trading Policy states that within 60 days of an application to trade, an applicant would be granted a smart card allowing him to operate in the CBD or given a reason why the application was declined.\nHowever, the delivery of smart cards was inconsistent and when a trader did receive the card, JMPD officers have been accused of confiscating the cards and failing to return them.\nDennis Webster, a researcher at Seri, said similar mismatches pertained to lease agreements. \"While most traders with whom we spoke pay rent, many of them remain unaware of signing any lease agreement.\"\nSERI represents 1,200 traders.\nThe City of Johannesburg and JMPD could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. However, in an article posted on the City of Johannesburg’s website, the City said Operation Clean Sweep was \"a strategic intervention vehicle which sought to tackle service delivery challenges in the Inner City\".\nThe article also says Operation Clean Sweep was meant to play a supporting role to other citywide programmes like the Integrated Service Delivery programme, Ward-Based Planning and the Joburg Ten Plus in which the Joburg Metro Police were concentrating on crime prevention, traffic policing as well as by-laws compliance in the each ward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:53:33.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
