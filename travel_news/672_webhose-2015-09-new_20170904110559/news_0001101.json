Building on its heritage in live experiential events, mcm has redefined itself to bridge the gap between creative concept agency and technical production company, spanning corporate events, experiential activation and film production. \nmcm’s refreshed website and updated marketing collateral highlights its new focus on marketing communications with a new strapline ‘communicating, creatively’. The agency has also moved to brand new offices at South Avenue Studios in Kew, London, having recently expanded its senior leadership team and made several other new hires. The brand refresh comes at the end of a strong financial year for the agency, in which mcm achieved an increase in net profit of 42 per cent over the previous 12 months. The agency has also seen a surge in interest from clients and prospects following its successful delivery of the high-profile John Lewis 150th anniversary event in September 2014. The refreshed website is now live and mcm will be celebrating the move to its new premises with a launch event in November. Lizzie Carver, Client Services Director, said, “This is a very exciting time for mcm. The business has gone from strength to strength with the increase in talent, a considered approach to delivering our three year strategic objectives and some excellent new client partners that have chosen to work with us. Our new environment and strategic hires marks the start of a new era for mcm and we can’t wait to see what the future brings” In the last six months, mcm has expanded its senior leadership team with three strategic appointments. Mark Nicholls joins the company as Creative Director, Brendan McCaul joins as Client Services Director, and Karen Evans as Client Director, as reported earlier this year. The agency also made appointments over the summer across its film and technical divisions. David Alison joined the team as Technical Manager to bring further excellent technical solutions to the team, and Dan Wardle joined the film division as Edit Assistant. Alison previously worked at AV specialists Savilles, while Wardle joined from Comic Relief’s broadcast department where he worked on Red Nose Day 2015. Commenting on the group’s performance, Nicky Milligan, Managing Director, said: “I’m extremely proud of our financial success over the last year and very excited to be launching our new look and focus. The recruitment drive we’ve been on is a true reflection of our how our business is growing and I’m delighted that we’re now settled in our new offices. As an agency, we’re looking forward to the year ahead and this exciting new chapter in mcm’s story.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:10:03.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
