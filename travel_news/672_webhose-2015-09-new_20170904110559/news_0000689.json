Businesses demand a lot of attention, and the constant energy required to keep everything on track means that it can sometimes be difficult to stay motivated and enthusiastic about what you are trying to do. The good news is that it is possible to find your momentum again. The first step is to identify the problem. If you are constantly feeling overwhelmed by how much you have to do, and how little time you have in which to do it, then you need to start delegating and handing over responsibility to others. SME owners are typically expected to be good at everything, from finance to sales, and from design to strategy. But that is unrealistic, so if there is an area you particularly struggle with then it makes a lot more sense either to find someone within the business who can take responsibility for that area, or else hire in some help from professionals. Make sure that you make the effort to get out of the office occasionally and make time for some non-work related activities If, however, the problem is that the business is not growing, or indeed is stagnating, then you need take a step back from the day-to-day running of the business and to look closely at your strategy – should you be investing more in new products, or moving into other sales areas? Part of the problem for lack of motivation could be loneliness, so make a point of meeting up with other SME owners at local networking events – finding other people in the same boat can be immensely reassuring, and you may benefit from their advice. Make sure that you make the effort to get out of the office occasionally and make time for some non-work related activities – climb a mountain, go fishing, get some fresh air, spend time with your children. Even if it is only for a short time, there is nothing like a change of scene to put things into perspective. You should also look for ways to expose yourself to external ideas and inspiration – as an SME leader it can be really easy to become too narrowly focused on the day-to-day running of the business and forget the wider world. So go to a conference, go on a training course, read a good book, listen to an insightful radio programme. All of these will widen your outlook and bring in new thoughts and ideas. Ingrid Waterfield, director at KPMG, the accountancy and professional services firm, says: “SME bosses need to remain energised if they are to inspire those they work closely with and run a successful business effectively. If they lack motivation, this will filter through the whole business and impact performance.” She advises: “Get together with your team outside your regular workplace and focus on the purpose of what you do and how you do it – generate new ideas, solve issues together, recognise your successes. Use an external speaker or facilitator to broaden horizons. Invest in yourself – spend a day every six to eight weeks attending a conference or networking event with peers on subjects that are of interest to you. \"It helps if you see things from a different perspective; hearing what others are doing can trigger ideas. Spend a day on the floor with the troops once a quarter – to really hear and see what’s happening on the ground and to see your strategy in action. \"Lastly, start volunteering. Volunteering either as an individual or as a team, or providing coaching to those with less experience, can be beneficial for you in terms of helping others as well as to those receiving the benefits of your wisdom and experience.” • Stay motivated and motivate your staff with the right company car, financed in the best way for your business.
