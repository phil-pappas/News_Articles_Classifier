Prepare to be amazed by spectacular recreations that bring the Bible to life through realistic architecture and presentations that not only entertain, but teach. \nEnter another world when you step into the Jerusalem Street Market located near the park entrance. It is there that you will come face to face with artisans and can interact with them to learn about the culture and how the people of Jerusalem lived in early Biblical times. Nearby, children are easily entertained in their own interactive Smile of a Child Adventureland, where they can enjoy a 15 minute presentation of the Parables of Jesus in the Smile of a Child Theater, craft stations and a rock climbing wall. \nOne of the highlights of your visit is sure to be the amazing 45 foot by 25 foot long model of ancient Jerusalem — the largest indoor model of its kind. Daily presentations retell the history of the city — from its beginnings as King David's capital city to its destruction by the Romans. See where Christ walked as He ministered and where He traveled during His final hours leading up to His crucifixion. \nAn especially moving experience is the \"Behold the Lamb\" passion drama — the longest running presentation at the park. It features new music and new scenes designed to put you right in the middle of the action so that you feel like a witness to this important event. \nAt the far end of the park, a vast display of Biblical artifacts in the Scriptorium provides an informative walk-through tour featuring the Van Kampen Collection that consists of several thousand manuscripts, scrolls, and other religious artifacts. \nAmong other highlights is a replica of the mobile Wilderness Tabernacle, where the Israelites worshiped during their 40 years of wandering in the desert. It is here that you will learn about the object inside the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant. \nIf you enjoy Christian music, you won't want to miss \"Celebrate Jesus\" karaoke, where you can actually stage your talent and sing praises to Jesus. Special Christmas Holiday Presentations \nBethlehem's Miracle Night , an original musical, follows Mary and Joseph to the lowly stable in Bethlehem where God gave His great gift. It is a joyful and exciting celebration of the Savior's birth. You'll see the amazement of the shepherds as they hear the angel's pronouncement and join the Magi as they worship and adore the newborn King. Even the innkeeper and his wife are changed because of their encounter. \nChristmas Dancing Waters inspire visitors to reflect on the Lord's majesty as beautiful fountains and lights are set to music in an inspirational presentation. \nThe True Story of St. Nicholas told like you've never seen it before. Laughs and surprises accompany the myths that became legends. \nYe Olde Strolling Christmas Carols presented by The Holy Land Experience Strolling Carolers, an a capella quartet dressed in the style of the day. They will delightfully put you in the Christmas spirit with old favorites along with the classic carols of yesteryear. \nSing Gloria: A Christmas Concert , presented on the steps of the Great Temple, combines incredible voices in powerful praise that includes new versions of some old favorites.
