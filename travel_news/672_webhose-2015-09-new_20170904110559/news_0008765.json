Alarmed, I threw off my covers, opened the door of my remote ger (a Mongolian yurt) and wondered if I was still dreaming. Before me was a vision straight out of the days of Genghis Khan: two Kazakh horsemen wearing fox-fur hats and brocade tunics galloping with about 60 horses across the steppe landscape of Mongolia. One of the men whipped his horse with a crop and the other let out a shrill “ Yeeee- ! ” as they kicked up clouds of dust and raced toward the snowy Altai Mountains in the distance.\nThe Kazakhs of Mongolia are seminomadic horsemen and herders. They live off the land and eat by training golden eagles to hunt fox and rabbit, a tradition passed down from their Turkic ancestors. I’d come to Bayan-Ulgii province, at the westernmost edge of Mongolia and a 3.5-hour flight from the capital of Ulaanbaatar, to see the Golden Eagle Festival, where Kazakhs from as far as 150 miles away converge each October to compete in a two-day display of their traditional hunting skills.\nOn the first day, my guide, Badral, and I drove from our campsite on a bumpy dirt road for half an hour to reach the festival. Looking out at the vast emptiness that surrounded us, I asked Badral how the people here can stand to live in such a remote place.\n“Mongolians believe that joy is a wide-open, empty space,” he said. “The nomadic way of life is to welcome everyone and offer hospitality,” he said. “You can approach any ger and will be invited in for food and drink.” What a lovely idea, I thought, sure that it was a story reserved for gullible tourists.\nENLARGE A ger at Three Camel Lodge The Lowdown // Seeing the Golden Eagle Festival ENLARGE Nomadic Expeditions offers 8-day group tours and customized individual trips to Ulaanbaatar and the Golden Eagle Festival (Oct. 3 and 4 this year). Longer itineraries include a stay at the company’s luxury Three Camel Lodge in southern Mongolia’s Gobi Desert (from $5,300 per person, nomadicexpeditions.com ).\nWhen we reached the festival grounds, we joined about 200 other spectators—most of them locals on horseback—on a plain bordered by cliffs. Suddenly, about 80 Kazakh hunters paraded toward us in elegant embroidered deels, or tunics, each with an eagle perched on his arm. The riders’ red silk hats lined with fox fur were topped with owl feathers for good luck. The two-day competition is a cross between a sporting event and fashion show, with the hunters scoring points for their eagles’ speed, agility and ability to pounce on prey as well as for their own outfits.\nIn the day’s first event, the hunters rode their horses carefully up the boulder-strewn side of a 1,000-foot cliff. At the top, they handed off their eagles to a helper before riding back down the steep cliff face. Back on level ground with the spectators, each hunter called to his eagle, which then rocketed down (they can dive at speeds up to 200 mph) with a whoosh, spread its wings wide (they can span 7 feet) and landed on its master’s arm. The eagles’ long talons and sharp beaks looked as though they could tear through rhino hide like a piece of silk. Each time a raptor landed, the crowd shouted its approval.\nThere were several competitions that day, including an archery contest and a horse race for young boys. But my favorite event was the kyzguar (girl chase), a Kazakh game played on horseback in which the women whip the men while chasing after them. “It’s a way for young men and women to meet,” Badral explained, laughing. “If a man can’t be whipped by his wife, he won’t survive.”\nAs I watched and rooted for the women, two horsemen, engaged in a fierce tug of war over a goat carcass, galloped straight toward me, sending other horses stampeding in all directions. I was sure I was about to be trampled and reflexively brought my hands up to my face while letting out a terrified scream. When I finally uncovered my face, I looked up to see a group of young boys on horseback unable to control their laughter.\nENLARGE Kazakh horseman with an eagle Photo: Alamy Before I had time to regret my decision to come to the festival, a woman standing nearby in the doorway of her ger gestured to me to come inside. She offered me a stool and handed me a glass of sweet, milky tea and a plate of steaming mutton dumplings. I did my best to indicate that they were delicious, and we both giggled. Badral had been telling the truth about nomadic hospitality.\nWhen I left, my hostess insisted that I take a bag of fresh goat’s cheese with me. I pulled off my red wool NYC cap and handed it to her. She examined it thoughtfully and placed it on her head. We could not speak to each other, but we had found a common language. And both of us smiled as wide as Mongolia’s joy-giving empty spaces.\nOther Far-Out Festivals Worth Traveling to This Autumn Pushkar Camel Fair India\nNov. 18-25: One of India’s most famous religious festivals and livestock fairs takes place in the northern state of Rajasthan, where thousands of people come every autumn to buy and sell livestock and to see camel races and performances by acrobats, dancers and musicians ( incredibleindia.org ).\nFloriade Canberra, Australia\nSept. 12- Oct. 11: Fall is Australia’s spring, and the city blossoms into a carpet of over a million tulips, roses, poppies and other varieties of flowers accompanied by a month-long festival of music, culinary demonstrations and cultural events focusing on the city’s heritage ( floriadeaustralia.com ).\nLusheng Festival Guizhou Province, China\nNov. 8: There’s plenty of singing and music, but courtship is one of the major goals of this post-harvest festival held by China’s Miao minority in which young women wear ornate silver headdresses and dance for the young men ( mythsandmountains.com ).\nFestival of Skulls Aguascalientes, Mexico\nOct. 30-Nov. 2: All Mexicans celebrate the Day of the Dead on Oct. 31, but the people of Aguascalientes extend the party, honoring their ancestors by re-enacting funeral ceremonies, constructing altars and laughing at mortality with a parade, parties and musical performances ( visitmexico.com ).\nJambay Lhakhang Drupchhen Festival, Bhutan\nOct. 27-30: In this ancient three-day festival, villagers gather at a 7th-century Buddhist temple, one of the oldest in Bhutan, and dance in masks and costumes to drive away the evil spirits.
