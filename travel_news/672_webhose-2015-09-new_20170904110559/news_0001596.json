Guest rooms will be fully upgraded with new furniture, carpeting and other soft goods while bathrooms will also see a total revamp. Changes to the rooms will result in a more modern look with accent walls complemented by softer lighting and dark woods evoking a warm feel. Public areas and the building exterior will also undergo a refresh with new carpeting, lighting and furniture. In a nod to the city’s most notable institution, new wall artwork will depict scenes from Duke University campus.\nIn addition to its location nearby Research Triangle Park – one of the world’s largest research parks – Millennium Hotel Durham is just minutes from Duke University and Duke University Hospital and serves as the closest off-campus full-service hotel. “Millennium Hotel Durham’s proximity to one of the best universities in the United States makes it a unique and exciting place to visit,” said Colin Wang, Vice President Operations, North America. “We look forward to unveiling this renovated property in 2016.”\nThis is the sixth Millennium hotel in the U.S. that will see upgrades in the past two years, including ONE UN New York, Millennium Hotel Minneapolis, Millennium Harvest House Boulder, The McCormick Scottsdale and most recently The Lakefront Anchorage. Additional properties currently undergoing renovations include Millennium Biltmore Los Angeles and Millennium Hotel Buffalo.\nSource: Millennium Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:33:33.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
