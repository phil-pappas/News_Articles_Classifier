When picking a ski or snowboard destination there are lots of factors to consider, from nightlife to off-slope activities to lodging. But the one thing you know you are going to do every single day of the trip is eat, so it’s important to consider the quality and quantity of ski town dining. This is especially true given the reputation many ski mountains have for high prices and low-quality food on the slopes, so before or after skiing, it is helpful to have great alternatives in town.\nOver the past few years Great American Bites has visited many of America’s favorite mountain towns, summer and winter, and has compiled the best ski town eats from coast to coast, for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Ski fare tends to be hearty, and favorites include barbecue, burgers, pizza and big breakfasts, but there are also some surprisingly eclectic offerings to enjoy this winter, from tasty Thai to Oaxacan specialties. And while just about every major ski town offers something good to eat, a few stand out with multiple topnotch offers, most notably Telluride, Colo.; Park City, Utah; and Jackson, Wyo.\nReason to visit: Standout burgers, barbecue, breakfasts and pizza that would all be great even if they weren’t in a top ski town.\nThe food: The long ski day starts with breakfast, and it is tough to beat the three Lake Tahoe locations of Red Hut Café , on both the Nevada and California sides, popular since 1959. Breakfast portions are enormous, and almost everything is good, but the signature is waffles, uniquely cakey and still using the original recipe from over half a century ago. The most unique offering is the bacon waffle, stuffed with whole slices. Red Hut locations are especially convenient to Heavenly, the region’s largest ski resort, with 28 lifts. Another great morning choice is the Bake Shop , right next to the lifts at Alyeska, Alaska’s largest ski resort, and one that averages nearly twice as much snowfall as most mountains in the Lower 48. The Bake Shop is renowned for its tall, carb-rich stacks of thin, crepe-like sourdough pancakes, with unique flavor and texture, and regulars are also loyal to its addictive and oversized sweet rolls.\nUSA TODAY\nRed Hut Cafe: Hearty breakfast with a side of Tahoe history\nUSA TODAY\nBrilliant Alaska breakfast tempts skiers and cruisers\nThe Paramount , in Steamboat Springs, Colo., offers one of the best breakfasts in all of skiing — and one of the best lunches, too. In the morning, it’s tough to beat specials like “S@#^ on a Shingle,” first-rate homemade corned beef hash topped with elk sausage gravy, two eggs and fresh-baked biscuits. Other tempting options include stuffed French toast, and “Green eggs and ham,” a skillet filled with eggs and spinach baked over Italian bread covered with house-cured ham, goat cheese and pecan pesto. Breads and sandwiches are exceptional, and the standout corned beef returns at lunch in a killer Reuben, while the Crab BLT and roast turkey are exceptional.\nUSA TODAY\nGreat American Bites: Superior ski breakfast in Steamboat Springs\nIf there’s a food synonymous with après ski, it’s the burger, and while every ski town has them, a few really excel. The bison burgers — the only burgers — at Park City’s No Name Saloon are standout, especially the odd house special, topped with a mound of cream cheese studded with sliced jalapenos. It works. Just down the street at the High West Distillery , which claims to be the world’s only ski-in/ski-out distillery and makes award-winning whiskies, the scrumptious house signature burger is a blend of beef and bison, covered with aged gruyere and bleu cheeses, plus caramelized onions on an artisanal bun, with parmesan-dusted fries. At Empire Burger in Breckenridge, Colo., which also features the highest ski lift in the nation, the large 1/3-pound patties are served on excellent brioche buns, with a staggering array of toppings, sauces and delicious combos. Larkburger , with several Colorado locations including one outside Vail, also uses high-quality 1/3-pound patties, but ups the ante with fine dining touches such as homemade mayo — four kinds — plus locally grown tomatoes, excellent hand-cut fries, and sides like edamame. It’s fast food done as well as you can do it.\nUSA TODAY\nNo beef: Park City saloon specializes in bison burgers\nUSA TODAY\nTop-shelf distillery, decadent desserts delight Park City visitors\nUSA TODAY\nGreat American Bites: A tasty ski-town burger in Breckenridge\nUSA TODAY\nLarkburger: Building a better burger, Colorado-style\nSalt Lake City, gateway to half a dozen world-class Utah resorts, has a uniquely Greek-influenced burger scene with two standout family-owned local chains. Crown Burger specializes in a patty topped with moist, broth-soaked Greek-style pastrami while Apollo Burger makes the delicious and decadent Athenian, with feta cheese, roasted red peppers, and a standout house tzatziki sauce.\nUSATODAY\nGreat American Bites: Crown Burger, Salt Lake City - USATODAY.com\nUSA TODAY\nRave review: Athenian burger at Utah's Apollo chain\nSalt Lake is also home to perhaps the best Mexican eatery in all of skiing, the famed Red Iguana , with three locations and a huge menu, best known for its array of seven different delicious, authentic and often very spicy takes on mole sauce. Another great choice for South of the Border cuisine is Zocalito in Aspen, Colo., hidden underneath a back alley and focused on the food of Mexico’s culinary capital Oaxaca, with such authentic offerings as fried grasshoppers.\nUSA TODAY\nGreat American Bites: Mexican food in Utah? Red Iguana is the real deal\nUSA TODAY\nGreat American Bites: A taste of Oaxaca in high-rent Aspen\nFor some reason ski resorts do not do a great job with Asian eateries (except for high-end sushi like Matsuhisa in Aspen and Vail), but a very pleasant and offbeat exception is Teton Thai , located near the base of Wyoming’s Jackson Hole. Locally loved, it’s run by a husband and wife team, and she is from Thailand and does the cooking. Despite the crowds, it is well worth the effort. Another unusual choice in the town of Jackson is Bin 22 , a Mediterranean tapas place with a wide variety of affordable and delicious Italian and Spanish inspired small plates, all set within a retail wine shop that sells bottles to drink at dinner with no upcharge, a rarity that completes a great après ski or dinner experience, and like Teton Thai, it is extremely popular with locals.\nUSA TODAY\nTop-notch tapas and charcuterie take the Tetons\nBarbecue is a traditional favorite found in just about every ski town, but unfortunately, it is rarely exceptional. That is what makes Moe’s Original Bar B Que and Oak stand out — they’d stand out anywhere. Moe’s is an Alabama-style chain founded by Alabamans that happens to have been born in Vail, Colo., and while there are now thirty in eight states, the original sits a stone’s throw from the Lionshead gondola and serves an amazing boneless rib sandwich, great pulled pork, and delicious shrimp po’ boys. Likewise, Oak sits next to the lifts at the base of Telluride, and is also owned by an Alabama transplant. The pork ribs are fantastic, as is the signature app, unconventional BLT “wraps” using lettuce leaves and house-cured bacon, all washed down with a deep bourbon and rye list.\nUSA TODAY\nBeyond McRib: Moe's Bar B Que does sparerib sandwich right\nUSA TODAY\nGreat American Bites: Ski-town BBQ reaches summit in Telluride\nPizza is another widely available but usually mediocre ski town staple, and again, Telluride has what may well be the nation’s best slopeside offering, the incredible Detroit-style pan version at Brown Dog Pizza . Baked in oiled rectangular metal pans, it’s a cross between Chicago and East Coast, rich and delicious. Because the crust is so exceptional, I recommend only ordering smalls (four slices versus eight) so you get only corners, each with twice the crust. The award-winning 313 (Detroit’s area code) has ricotta, garlic, genoa salami, red Calabrian chili peppers, sweet piquante peppers, fresh basil, and arugula. The East Coast has more standalone mountains and fewer true ski towns, but skiers can still find standout and unique pizza at American Flatbread in Waitsfield, Vt., near both the Sugarbush and Mad River Glen resorts. American Flatbread is now sold frozen nationwide, but it is much better at the source and this is the original location (there is also one in downtown Burlington, the main gateway to Vermont skiing). It features a sort of focaccia-like crust cooked in wood burning ovens, with impeccably sourced natural and unprocessed toppings like nitrate-free peperoni and sausages made of natural pork from a local farm.\nUSA TODAY\nOMG! Detroit-style pizza delivers taste sensation\nUSATODAY\nGreat American Bites: American Flatbread's unique take on pizza\nYum!
