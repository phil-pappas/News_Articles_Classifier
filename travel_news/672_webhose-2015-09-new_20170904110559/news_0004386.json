As the one-mile charity race was run under the Rules of Racing, it means the record books will have to be slightly amended; Gannicus, the 7-2 favourite, trained by Brendan Powell, will now go down as McCoy’s 4,358th winner and his 10th on the Flat. Having failed to engineer a winner from Box Office on his final ride over jumps at Sandown in April, it all went smoothly on this occasion. In front of royalty – the Princess Royal – and racing royalty, Lester Piggott, Frankie Dettori and Joe Mercer, as well as a crowd of 6,600, which was up nine per cent on last year, McCoy cruised to the front two out and, having issued a few reminders to his mount inside the final furlong, galloped on strongly to beat the Billy Newnes-ridden Next Stop two lengths into second. Riding on a 1lb 8oz ‘postage stamp’ saddle to make the 11st 5lb weight – which was auctioned at a charity lunch for £15,000 to bookmaker Fred Done making it worth, pound [£] for pound (lb) the same as gold – McCoy is clearly enjoying unfettered access to the fridge and the biscuit tin in retirement. Indeed, for the first time in 20 years, rather than two eyeballs peering out from a skull, he actually is beginning to look quite healthy. “Everything went to plan, but it always does when you win. Brendan told me not to hit the front until inside the furlong marker, but I was riding long enough to know not to pay too much attention to what the trainer says,” he quipped. The 20-times champion, who still rides out for Jonjo O’Neill, revealed that Berry at first asked him to ride in the race, then tried persuasion and eventually resorted to bullying to get him to dust off his boots. “It’s purely once and once only,” he insisted, “unless JP [McManus] ever wanted me to ride something – I’d never say no to him! It’s to say thanks for all the hard work Jack has done and it’s nice to go out on a winner.” McCoy clearly enjoyed the craic and banter of being back in the weighing room for a couple of hours. “I told Frankie that this time last year he was a hair’s breadth from getting an invitation to ride in this race,” he said. Powell was delighted with the win. “This is nearly as exciting as winning in Dubai [with Dark Emerald] last winter,” he said. “If that is his last winner, then fair play to him for doing it. I was hoping something wouldn’t come out of the pack and do him, but he’s still a hard jockey to get past” In six years Doncaster’s charity day has now raised in excess of £650,000, which has been split between Jack Berry House, the Injured Jockeys’ Fund new rehabilitation centre in Malton, and an accommodation wing for the Northern Racing College. Jack Berry House was opened on June 2 by the Princess Royal and is already proving as popular with injured jockeys in the north as its southern equivalent, Oaksey House, is in Lambourn. After paying tribute to Berry, who is still selling bricks for the house despite its apparent completion – he may have to build a maze – McCoy added: “I hope Jack enjoyed it as much as us jockeys” That he certainly did, saying the day was better than training a Royal Ascot winner.
