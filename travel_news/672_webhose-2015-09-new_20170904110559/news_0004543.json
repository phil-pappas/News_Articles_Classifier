Family-friendly pubs and quality restaurants abound in this atmospheric fishing village, the setting of ITV’s Doc Martin, and home to Fisherman’s Friends, the robust choir of local fishermen. The house has an unusually large and private garden. Sleeps up to 10 in four bedrooms. Location: 8/10 The modest frontage on quiet and picturesque Dolphin St, with its small courtyard garden, hides a much larger private garden to the rear, offering sunshine and quiet at the heart of the village. From the front door, the maze of narrow streets and ancient cottages give way to the harbour where fishing boats come and go, float or lie abandoned on the sand by the huge tide. The beach lends itself to rock pooling and beach combing. Port Isaac is barely navigable by car, but Trevan does have a garage for those who wish to try. Style & character: 8/10 The low-beamed ceilings and small downstairs rooms in Trevan are typical of the fishing cottages in Port Isaac. Trevan House has spacious and comfortable bedrooms However, the more spacious and brighter rooms upstairs are evidence of the slightly grander doctor’s residence that this built to be. The décor is fresh and the furnishings are comfortable and uncluttered. The well-equipped kitchen and living room are the central hub with a smaller sitting room and separate games room for children to play in. The dining area is in a bright conservatory, and there’s an outside table for dining al fresco. The charming paved and planted garden to the rear gives way to a secret garden with a lawn. Facilities: 8/10 The house is well equipped for young and old. Trevan House's small kitchen is well-equipped The kitchen is small but perfectly formed and well appointed. The double-bunk-bed room is a child’s dream, and the generous doubles are bright and comfortable, with lovely views over the garden. Bathrooms are spotless. Outside, a separate laundry room offers the perfect space for sandy shoes, drying clothes and beach paraphernalia. Value for money: 8/10 Cottage from £550 in low season; rising to £1950 in high. Linen not provided Family friendly: 8/10 An excellent choice for families with small children. No dogs. Eating The fishermen deliver their catch to the quayside every morning. Lobster and crab can be dressed by lunch time. There are numerous pubs, cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance, including two run by celebrity chef Nathan Outlaw. It is probably best to do the supermarket shop before you arrive. Access for guests with disabilities?
