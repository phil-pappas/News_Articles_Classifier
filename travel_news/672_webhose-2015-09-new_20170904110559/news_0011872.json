Check out this article. \nWondering what's fun and exciting for a 2015 Labor Day celebration? For an unusual way to celebrate, take an air tour of the Grand Canyon. There are both helicopter and airplane tours available, with plenty of options to suit any budget. Tours From The City That Never SleepsVegas is the place to begin an air tour of the West Rim. Air tours come in two options, which are landing, or air only. If you take a landing tour, you will land on top of the rim or on the canyon floor alongside the Colorado River, and if you take an aerial tour, you'll fly over the West Rim and head back to Vegas. While the aerial tours are fun and affordable, the landing tours give you a more comprehensive experience. Landing tours include a flyover, which is then complemented by some exciting landing options. For instance, you can book a landing tour that descends to the canyon floor where you enjoy a champagne picnic and take a relaxing boat ride along the river. You could land on top of the rim instead and add on VIP passes to the amazing Grand Canyon Skywalk. It's a clear glass bridge that lets you stand out over the canyon 4000 feet above the ground. A helicopter tour is thrilling, but even it doesn't match the breathtaking excitement of walking on the Skywalk. Airplane Flights And The South RimThe most affordable air tours are the airplane tours, plus, they are the best option when you have a big family or group that wants to fly together. They fly along the same route as the helicopters, but they just fly higher. They also can't land at the bottom of the canyon, but they are only around 80% of the cost of a helicopter tour. Another difference is airplanes fly from Vegas to the South Rim, but helicopters do not. It would take you over five hours to drive to Tusayan from Vegas, but in a plane it will only take one hour. From here, you could take a bus tour around the South Rim, enjoy a breathtaking Jeep tour, or you could even board a helicopter to see the South Rim, North Rim, and the far eastern boundary of the Grand Canyon National Park. You can choose a helicopter tour that is 30 or 50 minutes in length. The longer flight is ideal because it lets you see about 3/4 of the whole national park. You will have plenty of options to combine helicopter, Jeep, or bus tours on the ground, so no matter how much time you have or what your budget is, you will find a package that suits you at the South Rim. Buy Your Tour Online Before It Sells OutLabor Day is a very busy vacation holiday weekend, so you need to book your tour as soon as possible. It's a good idea to book your tour right after you book your hotel. You can buy your tour online with your credit card and have your seats reserved and waiting, plus when you buy online, you'll get the lowest price. Labor Day is the perfect time to view one of America's beloved landmarks. The Grand Canyon is filled with beauty, adventure, Native American culture, natural history, and nature at its finest, so don't miss your chance to see it while the weather is still fantastic at the canyon.
