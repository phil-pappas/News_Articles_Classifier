Careful restoration of the residential-style hotel has retained the French and Spanish-influenced design details of artist and architect Santiago Medina Mejia’s original 1946 building, while technologies have been fully updated and modern luxuries added for today’s most discerning travellers and local guests. Sixty-two rooms and suites – no two alike - have been beautifully redecorated taking advantage of unique features such as fireplaces or beamed ceilings, and all feature the new, fully customisable Four Seasons Bed. An all-new dining concept will also be unveiled upon opening: Castanyoles Raciones y Tapas, named for the traditional hand-held percussion instruments also known as castanets. With a wood-burning grill and Spanish tiles inside and a broad terrace beneath a new glass atrium outside, Castanyoles will serve a Spanish-influenced menu for breakfast, lunch, dinner and cocktails, as well as offer gourmet items and Colombian coffee to go. The 16-seat private dining room is ideal for intimate celebrations, family dinners and business meetings. Additional features include a full-service spa retreat and 24-hour gym for the exclusive use of Four Seasons guests. Graciously appointed event spaces include the Casa Medina Room for up to 120 guests to dine or 200 for a reception, as well as several other rooms for smaller gatherings or breakout meetings. Of special interest is the Los Rosales room, formerly the hotel’s restaurant, with its handcrafted wooden walls, stone columns and wrought iron rails. It can accommodate groups from 25 for a meeting to 60 for a reception. Business travellers need only stop by the front desk to fulfil any needs, and families will find the thoughtful amenities and services for which Four Seasons is renowned worldwide. Now Accepting Reservations In celebration of its grand opening, Four Seasons Hotel Casa Medina Bogota is offering the Experience More package, which includes a USD 100 (approx. £64) hotel credit.
