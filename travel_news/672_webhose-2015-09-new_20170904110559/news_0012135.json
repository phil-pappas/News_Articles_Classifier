The capacity utilization rate, taking into account the capacity adaptation carried out, increased by 1.5 percent, thus reaching a record level of 90.9 percent. \nThe capacity utilization for the first eight months of 2015 also increased in yearly comparison, reaching 84.5 percent, an increase of 0.8 percentage points over the previous year. \nAs Stefan Pichler, CEO of the airberlin group, stated: \"This positive development demonstrates that we are on track with the first initiated measures we are taking to reposition airberlin. It is now important that we achieve a stable capacity utilization in the coming months as well. The higher capacity utilization contributes to a positive business development. We introduced significant, tough measures across our business in the first half of 2015 in order to optimize our operations and we are continuing to explore ways to reduce our operating costs still further. The implementation of our world-class revenue management system will be the driving force for further improvements in the quality of our revenue. \nWe believe that the benefits will be reflected in the results for the second half of the year, at which time we expect our fare yields to increase, our capacity management to improve, and our revenue per available seat kilometer to climb‚Äù. \nIn total, 3,326,489 passengers traveled on airberlin in the month of August. Due to the capacity reduction by 6.9 percent in August, Germany's second-largest airline company recorded 4.2 percent fewer passengers than in the corresponding month of the previous year. The accumulated number of passengers for the January to August 2015 period declined by 4.0 percent to 20,609,465 passengers in yearly comparison, whereas capacity was reduced by 6.5 percent during that period. \nIn line with airberlin's continuous global network and fleet optimization programme, the revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) decreased by 4.4 percent to 5.170 billion kilometers and the available seat kilometers (ASK) decreased by 6.1 percent to 5.691 billion kilometers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:31:57.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
