The conference is open to all with an interest in promoting participation growth.\nFederal Minister for Sport Sussan Ley encouraged those in the Australian sports industry to register for the conference, enabling them to become influential in creating stronger, more sustainable participation pathways.\n“So many of our national teams have sparked widespread interest in sport with their triumphs on home soil this year, including the Socceroos winning the Asian Cup, our cricketers lifting the Cricket World Cup and, most recently, the Diamonds claiming a third successive Netball World Cup,” Minister Ley said.\n“We can also look at 2015 as a pivotal year in establishing growth opportunities for Australian participation in sport.\n“Earlier this year I launched Play.Sport.Australia. a blueprint that sets an agenda for getting more Australians active. This has coincided with the national launch of the $100 million Sporting Schools programme, which provides fun, healthy, active opportunities for Australia’s primary school children to sample more than 30 of Australia’s favourite sports.\n“Our Sporting Future 2015 is a significant opportunity for key sporting leaders to come together, brainstorm ideas and continue playing their part in boosting participation rates and making grassroots sport sustainable well into the future.”\nQueensland Minister for Tourism, Major Events, Small Business and the Commonwealth Games, Kate Jones, welcomed the opportunity to host Australia’s sports industry leaders in Queensland in October.\n“Our Sporting Future will shine the spotlight on the Gold Coast as a premier sporting event destination,” Minister Jones said.\n“As we look toward the 2018 Commonwealth Games, it is events such as this that demonstrate the Gold Coast’s ability to host major events which will leave a lasting legacy for the State.\n“Events play an important role in driving tourism on the Gold Coast and creating jobs for Queenslanders.”\nASC Chief Executive Officer Simon Hollingsworth said Our Sporting Future was the ideal chance for the sports industry to come together in the build-up to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games.\n“Queensland – and more specifically the Gold Coast – is the ideal venue to hold the Our Sporting Future conferences especially in the lead up to the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games,” Mr Hollingsworth said.\n“The conferences provide delegates with prime opportunities to hear from some of the leaders in the sports industry.\n“There are also forums that allow the sports industry to address future challenges and take advantage of new developments, to build better sporting organisations and to promote lifelong participation.\nSource:- Queensland Tourism", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T14:57:55.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
