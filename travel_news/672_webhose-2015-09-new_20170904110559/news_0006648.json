If they backed off a proper distance and then looked at what was happening way ahead they would be able to respond properly without having to do an emergency stop every 30 seconds!! I do despair of most drivers nowadays - all so scared of leaving a proper gap in case someone nips in there and adds a few more seconds to their journey!!

Or they know that it's hard to get into the right lane after ringwood so they pick their lane early on and sit there. Which make it all worse. Why not put those chevrons down with reminders to keep two chevrons apart. Sometimes things like these are cheaper and more effective than police cars...
