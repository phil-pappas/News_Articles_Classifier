Ms Colliander will act as the lead buyer in the organization tasked with leading the Advisory Board, which is a pivotal force in establishing the direction of GBTA in Europe. \nMs Colliander is Head of Global Travel with Boston Consulting Group. She has been with the firm since 2008. Her responsibility is to set the vision and overall strategic direction of the global travel program. She has over 20 years experience in the travel industry including airline pricing and revenue management at major airlines. “Gehan has been an active member and core contributor to GBTA as part of the Strategic Benchmark Group and Aviation Committee,” said Catherine McGavock, Regional Vice President for GBTA EMEA. “Her pedigree as a buyer and supplier will be invaluable to the advisory board and to GBTA in Europe. We have been extremely fortunate to have enjoyed the leadership of Torbjörn Erling for four years now for which we are incredibly grateful, but know that we are turning the leadership over to good hands.” “I am honoured to take on this role for GBTA,” said Ms Colliander. “As a buyer, I value the GBTA membership and believe there is no other comparable association in the market in representing the buyer's needs. I look forward to working with the Board to ensure that GBTA continues to be an invaluable part of the Travel Buyers’ armoury.” Ms Colliander will take over the role of GBTA Europe President in the autumn when the current Chair, Torbjörn Erling steps down. Mr Erling will remain on the Advisory Board until the end of the year.
