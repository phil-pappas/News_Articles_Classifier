And the good news is you've landed in a city that boasts a host of excellent places where you can get an expertly-made brew. Ask your airport transfer service driver for some locals' only tips, but the ones below might get you off on a good start. \nTimberyard: Old Street + Seven Dials \nThis café is described as a ‘dynamic workspace fused with speciality tea and coffee’, and it proves itself worthy of this claim. Timberyard will welcome you in whether you are meeting a few friends, taking a break from running errands and want a pick-me-up, or holding an informal business meeting with a small group of clients. If you’re flying to or from City airport, you might also find that your airport transfer service will pass close to Old Street or Seven Dials (depending on where you’re staying). \nUnsurprisingly, coffee is at the heart of what they do at Timberyard, with delectable beans supplied by the renowned Has Bean company and skilful baristas delivering top-notch brews. If you have time to spare, order the Chemex filter coffee: it takes over ten minutes to brew, but the result is a cup full of plenty of aromatic goodness. \nTap Coffee: Rathbone Place + Tottenham Court Road + Wardour Street \nTap Coffee is one of those cafés that is proud of what it does and how it does it. It sources the finest ingredients, and serves them up in a comfortable, welcoming space.If you're looking for something slightly different, Tap Coffee’s cold brew cannot be missed. Brewed overnight with cold water, it creates an end product that is both invigorating and unexpected; plus, it comes in quirky glass medicine bottles, if you love the extra little details. Another speciality is their Jam Jar Latte: strong, milky coffee sweetened with syrup, shaken, and served in a jam jar. \nFreeState Coffee: Southampton Row \nFreestate is a quaint espresso bar in the centre of London that holds itself up to very high standards, both with regards to their coffee sourcing and barista training. It regularly showcases the best coffee blends from countries as diverse as Ethiopia and Denmark, as well as having a small selection of beans and coffee paraphernalia on sale. FreeState Coffee’s menu is also full of pleasant surprises, such as homemade almond milk and absolutely luscious cakes. \nCoffee aficionados will be spoilt for choice in London and these are just a few of the many recommendations to sample the best the city has to offer.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nLukas Johannes is a driver for Shuttle Direct.
