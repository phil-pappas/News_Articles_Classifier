Our staff are specially trained to deal with such situations.\n“We would like to express our thanks to the off duty police officer who stepped in, it was a really helpful intervention. We would like to apologize to the customers for any distressed caused and also for the short delay to the start of their holiday.”\nLouise Rowcroft was among those waiting for the flight to land in Turkey so they could get on board to return to the UK.\nDue to the air rage incident, they faced delays of 18 hours. It took a total of 27 hours to get back home.\nShe said: “I’ve just got home as a result of this, the crew were not fit to fly us home so we have been stuck in Turkey.\n“Approximately 250 of us had to fly to Manchester then get a bus back to Newcastle.\n“Can’t fault Thomas Cook.”\nThe airline will assist police with any possible legal action taken against the woman who caused the delay. She has not been named. The woman’s male partner also deplaned in Sofia though he was not involved in the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:01:34.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
