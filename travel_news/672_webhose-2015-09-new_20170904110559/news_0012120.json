The report underscores Allstate's commitment to keeping roadways safer.\nAccording to the report, the average driver in Brownsville will experience an auto collision every 13.3 years. Brownsville ranks fourth when population density is considered and third when precipitation is considered.\n\"As a trusted advisor to Allstate customers in Brownsville , we're sharing these report results to help them become safer drivers,\" said Rick Ortiz , an Allstate agency owner in Brownsville . \"While Brownsville ranks highly on the report, slowing down, leaving room between you and other drivers, and minimizing distractions are tips for Brownsville's drivers to always remember to remain safe while on the road.\"\nThe Allstate America's Best Drivers Report was created to facilitate an ongoing dialogue on safe driving that saves lives. Kansas City, Kansas , is recognized as the safest driving city in America with the average driver experiencing an auto collision every 13.3 years, which is 24.8 percent less likely than the national average of every 10 years.\nRecently, the National Safety Council estimated the U.S. is on track for its deadliest driving year since 2007. ii For the first six months of 2015, NSC reported traffic deaths are up 14 percent from a year ago, and serious injuries are 30 percent higher over the same period. While there are many factors that impact highway safety, an improving economy and lower gas prices have led to an increase in the number of miles being driven. The Federal Highway Administration's latest Traffic Volume Trend Report says cumulative travel for 2015 is up by 3.5 percent. iii The June report is based on hourly traffic count data reported by the states, using data collected at approximately 4,000 continuous traffic counting locations nationwide.\nBelow is a look at how other cities in Texas finished in the Allstate America's Best Drivers Report.\nCity & Overall Ranking\nCollision Likelihood Compared\nto National Average\nAverage Years Between\nCollisions\nAmarillo (23)\n-8.1%\n10.9\nArlington (175)\n+40.9%\n7.1\nAustin (166)\n+37.1%\n7.3\nBrownsville (2)\n-24.6%\n13.3\nCorpus Christi (58)\n+4.8%\n9.5\nDallas (177)\n+43.0%\n7.0\nEl Paso (50)\n+2.1%\n9.8\nFort Worth (153)\n+30.9%\n7.6\nFrisco (146)\n+27.6%\n7.8\nGarland (181)\n+44.4%\n6.9\nGrand Prairie (171)\n+38.0%\n7.2\nHouston (170)\n+37.9%\n7.2\nIrving (182)\n+44.4%\n6.9\nKilleen (135)\n+24.8%\n8.0\nLaredo (8)\n-14.7%\n11.7\nLubbock (53)\n+2.5%\n9.8\nMcAllen (36)\n-2.1%\n10.2\nMcKinney (154)\n+31.5%\n7.6\nMesquite (162)\n+36.4%\n7.3\nPasadena (99)\n+14.7%\n8.7\nPlano (163)\n+36.5%\n7.3\nSan Antonio (137)\n+26.1%\n7.9\nWaco (106)\n+15.7%\n8.6\nAllstate visually depicts the report in an interactive map found at www.allstate.com/BestDriversReport .

Stop-and-go traffic, gridlock, traffic signal stops, pedestrian walkways and events that create traffic detours can add time to your travel. Stay alert. Be prepared to frequently stop or slow down for pedestrians, emergency vehicles, delivery trucks, parking cars, taxi cabs, and public transportation vehicles such as city buses. Driving tips for cities with high levels of precipitation:\nBe aware of road conditions. Ice, snow, fog, rain - all of these weather conditions require extra caution and slower speeds. Stopping safely in rain and snow takes greater lengths of roadway than in dry conditions. Maintain your vehicle to prepare for extreme weather. Headlights and brake lights are critical in low visibility situations – be sure they are consistently maintained along with other critical car functions such as brakes and windshield wipers. The Allstate America's Best Drivers Report®\nFor the past 11 years, Allstate actuaries have conducted an in-depth analysis of company claims data to determine the likelihood drivers in America's 200 largest cities will experience a vehicle collision compared to the national average. Reported property damage claims were analyzed over a two-year period (from January 2012 to December 2013 ).\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an estimated 32,675 car crash fatalities occurred in 2014. iv Additionally, Allstate research found that 70 percent of vehicles involved in auto claims are considered drivable, which indicates that most claims are the result of low-speed (under 35 miles per hour) collisions. Allstate utilizes the America's Best Drivers Report to remind drivers to stay vigilant behind the wheel and protect themselves from challenging driving conditions.\nAbout Allstate\nThe Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) is the nation's largest publicly held personal lines insurer, protecting approximately 16 million households from life's uncertainties through auto, home, life and other insurance offered through its Allstate , Esurance , Encompass and Answer Financial brand names. Allstate is widely known through the slogan \"You're In Good Hands With Allstate ® .\" The Allstate brand's network of small businesses offers auto, home, life and retirement products and services to customers in the United States and Canada . In the 20 years since Allstate became a fully independent public company, The Allstate Foundation, Allstate, its employees and agency owners have donated more than $405 million to support local communities .\ni The Allstate America's Best Drivers Report® tabulates property damage collision frequency of Allstate insured drivers from 2012-2013.The report analyzes the 200 largest cities from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places over 50,000, measured for 2013 as of July 1, 2014 . In prior years, neighboring cities that shared zip codes also shared rankings. This only impacted a minimal number of cities; however, in 2014 and 2015, the report used geolocation to increase accuracy and there are no longer shared rankings. U.S. Census Bureau data was used to obtain the population density factor. For the precipitation factor, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data was utilized. Allstate Drivewise® data is based on Allstate customers voluntarily enrolled in the telematics program from 2010-2014. A number of cities from the full 200 Best Drivers rankings are excluded in the Drivewise data due to the limited measurable data available, or because Drivewise was not available ( California , North Carolina , South Carolina and Texas ). The Allstate Best Drivers Report is produced solely to boost the country's discussion about safe driving and to increase awareness of the importance of being safe and attentive behind the wheel. The report is not used to determine auto insurance rates.\nii National Safety Council, http://www.nsc.org/Measure/Pages/safety-management-research-statistical-services.aspx\niii Traffic Volume Trends (US DOT – Federal Highway Administration, Office of Highway Policy Information): http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/tvt.cfm\niv National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, www.distraction.gov\n releases/brownsville-ranks-second-among-safest-cities-on-the-11th-annual-allstate-americas-best-drivers-report-300135808.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.allstate.com/financial/life-insurance/main.aspx?cid=OTC-PR-Corp-150312", "http://www.nsc.org/Measure/Pages/safety-management-research-statistical-services.aspx", "http://www.encompassinsurance.com/?cid=OTC-PR-Corp-150312", "http://www.allstatenewsroom.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.allstate.com/?cid=OTC-PR-Corp-150312", "http://www.allstate.com/BestDriversReport", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/brownsville-ranks-second-among-safest-cities-on-the-11th-annual-allstate-americas-best-drivers-report-300135808.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DA90263&Transmission_Id=201509011000PR_NEWS_USPR_____DA90263&DateId=20150901", "http://www.distraction.gov/", "https://ourstory.allstate.com/?cid=OTC-PR-Corp-150312", "http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/tvt.cfm", "http://www.esurance.com/", "https://www.allstate.com/corporate-responsibility.aspx?cid=OTC-PR-Corp-150312", "http://www.answerfinancial.com/"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:57:07.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
