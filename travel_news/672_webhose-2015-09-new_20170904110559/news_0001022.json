We will continue to work hand in hand with the travel trade here to spread Disney’s magic to guests in Indonesia.” \n\nTo grow the market amid rising theme park competition in Asia, Leung commented that Hong Kong Disneyland would continue its strength in “telling stories”, innovating and launching new attractions such as the Iron Man Experience and Disney Explorers Lodge, which are slated for opening in late 2016 and 2017 respectively. \n\nHong Kong Disneyland has also participated in various outbound travel fairs in Indonesia to entice outbound travellers with special offers and bonuses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T16:39:37.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
