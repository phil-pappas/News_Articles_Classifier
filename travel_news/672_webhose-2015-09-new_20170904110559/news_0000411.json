From there, we headed to Cedar City, a good-sized Utah town to plot our Utah tour. The next morning, we headed east on Highway 14 to Utah 89, then east on Highway 12 to Bryce Canyon National Park. Approaching Bryce, we skirted Red Rock Canyon, rocks ablaze in the same color, noting an 8.6 mile bike trail paralleling much of that scenic area. We arrived at Bryce Canyon National Park about 10 a.m. and proceeded to the North Campground (first come, first served) at 7,800 feet. Happily, we found plenty of camping spaces available — which did not much fill throughout the day. This large campground is right on Bryce Canyon’s rim, so wonderful views and the campground amphitheater were just steps away. Ebenezer and Mary Bryce homesteaded the area, first moving in 1862 to nearby Pine Valley, where Bryce took charge of building the Pine Valley Chapel, the oldest Mormon Chapel in continuous use in Utah. The family then moved to Paria Valley, just south of Bryce Canyon; when asked about the awesome canyon behind his homestead, Bryce noted “it's a tough place to lose livestock.” On our first day, we drove the length of Highway 63 along the canyon rim, 16 miles south to Rainbow and Yovimpa Points. Here we stopped to admire incredible views, which repeated in succession at Aqua Canyon, Natural Bridge, Farview Point, Swamp Canyon, Bryce Point, Inspiration Point and Sunset Point. We visited the Bryce Canyon Lodge, opened in 1926 by the Union Pacific Railroad, with lodge rooms and 15 outlying cabins and a large, homey restaurant that opens at 5 a.m. for early-morning hikers. A breakfast the next day met all our expectations, with exceptional service as well. Make a first stop the North Entrance Visitor Center, for a 25-minute Bryce Canyon movie that explained the canyon’s formation, visitor highlights and interesting seasonal changes. With 80 degree days and comfortable nights to come, it’s hard to believe that snow and freezing temperatures blanket the area up to six months per year. In the evening, we trekked along the Rim Trail, just 150 feet from our campsite — and found some of the best views and photos were an easy walk from our teardrop travel trailer. On our second day, we traversed the Queens Garden/Navajo combination loop starting at Sunset Point, a 2.9-mile trek descending 600 feet from the Rim Trail down into the canyon. Bryce Canyon is famous for thousands of Hoodoos (strangely shaped pillars of rock in multihued colors of white, red, yellow and blue, left standing after millennia of erosion). Words do little justice to these other-worldly formations, towering over tourists who hike through deep canyons lined by cliffs and Hoodoos. That night, we walked to the Ranger program, a dazzling presentation on today’s astronomy in the parks, admiring a stunning, star-lit sky. For native fauna, the park features several Utah prairie dog colonies, hundreds of mule deer, pronghorn antelope (fastest animal in world, behind the cheetah), mountain lions and bears. On Friday, it was off early to Zion National Park, a 75-mile drive through very pretty Utah valleys and up-thrust mountain ranges. Zion is intrinsically different than Bryce Canyon, with huge valleys flanked by vertical cliffs carved by the Virgin River in shades of white, red and blue hues, owing to iron and manganese shading the limestone. We hiked the Lower and Middle Emerald Pools Trail, then the Grotto Trail above the Virgin River, to catch the free shuttle. We then hiked the short trail to Weeping Wall, a pleasant, misty and drippy respite on a day that pushed 95 degrees by 3 p.m. While in Zion, don’t miss the hike to The Narrows. This section is the narrowest of the canyon, with walls towering thousands of feet, only 20 to 40 feet wide. Choices of hikes range from short to long; but heed weather forecasts. A few days after our visit, violent thunderstorms created flash floods in Zion, killing six tourists. We finished our day, hot and tired, and found our way to the brew pub near the South Visitor Center, where a Reuben sandwich and several beers quenched our thirst. An ice cream cone in Bryce Canyon City capped a busy day before getting back to our campsite and a welcome campfire. After almost four days exploring Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks, we headed off to a reunion with old friends in Park City, Utah, 240 miles north of Zion. Site of the 2002 Winter Olympics and home to Park City, Deer Valley and the Canyons Ski Resorts, it’s a year-round outdoor activities mecca. Park City, with more than 170 casual to luxurious restaurants and hundreds of shops for tourists, offers something for everyone. Wander the “Park Silly Farmers Market,” held Sundays on Main Street, for eclectic arts and crafts, fresh produce and great music (held June to late October). While luxuriating in a Park City timeshare, we made side trips to the Utah Olympic Park (where U.S. Olympics hopefuls train on ski jumping, bobsled, luge and other winter activities) and up another canyon to Snowbird and Alta, several of Utah’s other world-class ski resorts. We also made plans for a mellow, two-hour rafting trip on the nearby Provo River and a trip to the old railroad in nearby Heber City before pressing our search for three more Utah national parks. — Contact Tim Viall at tviall@msn.com.
