At a recent public event outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art, passers-by wrote their burdens on strips of cloth and then tied the fabric in a knot. Challenges ranged from addictions to student loans to health problems. \nParticipants were then invited to undo someone else’s knot — to symbolically share that person’s hardship — and weave it through a loom for all to see. \n“I thought it was nice to be aware of someone else’s pains, someone else’s struggles, and that you’re not alone,” said Abigail Quintos of Rochester, N.Y. “A lot of other people are going through tough times in their lives.” \nQuintos’ own knot addressed the strain of living so far away from her family; the one she untied dealt with an individual’s housing and child-custody hardships. \nLisa Cerasaro’s knot concerned what she described as the scourge of corporate greed in America. \nFrancis is scheduled to visit Philadelphia on Sept. 26 and 27 to close out the World Meeting of Families, a triennial Catholic conference focused on strengthening family bonds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T02:31:53.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
