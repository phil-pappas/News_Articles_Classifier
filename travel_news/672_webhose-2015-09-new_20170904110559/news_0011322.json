Special fishing opportunities for panfish or trout are available on 21 waters this Labor Day , under the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission's (PFBC) Mentored Youth Fishing Program.\nIn addition, new or lapsed anglers who want to fish on Labor Day but don't want to pay the full price for a license now have the opportunity to purchase a one-day discounted license for $1 . The discount is available for residents and non-residents and the license can be used to fish anywhere in the Commonwealth on Labor Day .\nThe PFBC announced last month that it will stock trout in four waters for a special mentored youth event on Labor Day .\nThe four waters are in addition to 17 Panfish Enhancement lakes which will be used to offer kids and their mentors a special fishing experience on the holiday, which falls on Monday, Sept. 7 . To encourage participants to share their experiences, the PFBC will hold a special photo contest through its Facebook page beginning on Labor Day . The Facebook link is http://on.fb.me/1KHBMTJ .\n\"For many people, Labor Day offers the last long weekend to be on the water before getting back to the routine of school,\" said PFBC Executive Director John Arway . \"But we want to remind anglers that fishing is a year-round sport and doesn't end after the traditional trout or bass seasons or when kids return to the classroom. We introduced the panfish opportunity last fall, and decided to expand the idea this year by giving trout anglers something to look forward to.\"\n\"In addition, we're offering a 1-day Labor Day license for just $1 , providing an easy and affordable way for individuals to take young anglers fishing, to introduce friends to fishing for the first time, or to just enjoy a relaxing day on the water by themselves,\" he added. \"And the $1 license can be used to fish anywhere in the Commonwealth on the Labor Day holiday.\" This is the second year the PFBC has offered a 1-day Labor Day license.\nThe four waters which will be stocked with trout include:\nCentre County – Poe Lake, Poe Valley State Park; Fulton County - Cowans Gap Lake, Cowans Gap State Park; Huntingdon County – Greenwood Lake, Greenwood Furnace State Park; and Wayne County - Upper Woods Pond. Each water will receive its fall or winter allotment of stocked trout early this year, provided that water temperatures don't rise above acceptable levels. If water temperatures become elevated, the stockings will be postponed. But each of the waters will remain open to fishing. Anglers are encouraged to check the PFBC website for up-to-date information.\n\"If we have to postpone stockings, we plan to host a Mentored Youth event in the fall, giving kids and their mentors another opportunity to get outside and enjoy a day of fishing,\" added Arway.\nDuring the Labor Day event, adults and children can fish for trout, but only kids with a voluntary youth fishing license or free mentored youth permit may keep up to two trout of 7\" or greater. Adults must have a fishing license, but a trout stamp is not required.\nOn this day no trout may be kept from these four waters by anyone other than a participating youth. This is a change from the way the mentored youth trout program has been administered previously. The PFBC modified the program in response to numerous positive comments about the youth harvest portion of the program and related comments suggesting that only children, and not adults, should be allowed to keep what they catch during the mentored youth trout days.\nThe Panfish Enhancement lakes were chosen as mentored youth fishing opportunities because the waters are managed to increase the number and size of fish. Panfish include bluegill, pumpkinseed, and redear sunfish, which are collectively called sunfish; black and white crappies; and yellow perch.\n\"Kids should catch a lot of sunfish, crappies and perch, which makes the day fun,\" Arway said. \"As an added incentive, we're also removing the minimum size limits, which are either seven or nine inches, depending on the species, for kids and their mentors on this day.\"\nThe 17 lakes will be open to all anglers but only mentored youth participants (adults and kids) may keep fish under the minimum size. The lakes included in the program are, by county:\nBerks - Blue Marsh Reservoir Cambria - Beaverdam Run Reservoir, Hinkston Run Reservoir, Wilmore Dam Centre - Foster Joseph Sayers Lake Chester - Chambers Lake Montour - Lake Chillisquaque Monroe - Bradys Lake , Gouldsboro Lake Pike - Lower and Upper Promised Land Lakes Somerset - High Point Lake, Quemahoning Reservoir Washington - Cross Creek Lake Westmoreland - Lower Twin Lake, Northmoreland Lake, Upper Twin Lake \"We have a rich history of trout and bass fishing in the Commonwealth and the opening days are truly traditional events enjoyed by families,\" Arway added. \"But we also have many other outstanding fishing opportunities, including panfish. Fishing doesn't end when school starts. We want to show families where they can go and how easy it can be to fit fall fishing into their schedules.\"\n\"The PFBC also reminds anglers that if they are holding a gift voucher for a voluntary youth fishing license, this is a great time to redeem it and participate in the Labor Day special opportunities,\" he added.\nTo participate in the mentored youth program, adult anglers (16 years or older) must have a valid fishing license and be accompanied by a youth. Youth anglers must obtain a free PFBC-issued permit or a voluntary youth fishing license. So far this year, more than 18,700 kids have obtained a free permit and another 9,200 have purchased a voluntary youth fishing license.\nThe photo contest will run from Labor Day through Sunday, Sept. 13 (Grandparents Day). Participants must be at least 18-years-old. Prizes includes $100 , $50 and $25 gift cards to Bass Pro Shops.
