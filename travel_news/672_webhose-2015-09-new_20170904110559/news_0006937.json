Today marks one year exactly to the start of the 2016 Ryder Cup. Captains, players and fans will start to analyse the standings, their interest growing by the week. Hazeltine is just around the dogleg. Darren Clarke and Davis Love III, the captains, have been in analytical mode since they were appointed early this year. Their contrasting missions will form a key theme of the narrative. For Clarke it will be all about continuing Europe’s success, sticking to the template that has served so many predecessors so well. A proud Ryder Cup player, he will certainly not want to be only Europe’s second losing captain this century. Love does not want to lose for the second time in four years. After all the fallout from the defeat at Gleneagles last year, when Tom Watson presided over the United States’ sixth loss in seven matches, the US Ryder Cup “task force” took a step backwards to move forward and reappointed the 2012 leader. Three years ago, Love was unlucky to be on the wrong side of the “Miracle of Medinah” as Europe recovered to win. More than most other beaten Cup captains, he deserves his shot at redemption. He will have Tom Lehman at his right hand. So far the momentum appears to be in his favour. The progress of Jordan Spieth has obviously been a huge fillip. In partnership with Patrick Reed, Spieth made a huge impression at Gleneagles and this year, of course, won his two majors. With Rickie Fowler fulfilling his extraordinary potential and Dustin Johnson coming close to a first major, Love has a strong core. Bubba Watson is an established top-10 performer, Zach Johnson won the Open and Jimmy Walker will complement his roster. And, with the likes of Brooks Koepka and Billy Horschel coming through, there should be plenty to inspire experienced players such as Jim Furyk and Phil Mickelson. Love must look down the list of probables and feel thrilled by the possibilities. With so many heavyweights trying to pick themselves up off the golfing canvas, Clarke may have a surfeit of youngsters in his side He said: “We have guys with experience who are excited about it and tell me they want to be on a winning Ryder Cup team; young guys who haven’t played but are on a roll and want to make the team. It’s a very exciting time for US golf.” Yes, there will be the Tiger Woods question to answer, but only if he returns to his best form. Right now, there is more to discuss about Love’s possible participation as a player, after the 51-year-old won the Wyndham Championship last month, his first PGA Tour title in seven years. “I would play, sure,” he said. “We have Tom and a bunch of others waiting in the wings to help. He’s not just an assistant who is waiting until next year to help decide who gets a captain’s pick. That’s the whole point of what we’ve created with the task force.” Love and Lehman are putting faith in their knowledge of Hazeltine and plan to camp out there in the build-up. They are considering changing the order of the holes so the atmosphere will heighten the further the matches progress. Home advantage will be everything to Love, as it was to Paul Azinger at Valhalla in Kentucky in 2008. That presents Clarke with a problem. A rowdy away match is the last place to blood debutants, but with so many of his heavyweights trying to pick themselves up off the golfing canvas, he may have a surfeit of youngsters in his side. Lee Westwood, Graeme McDowell, Ian Poulter and Martin Kaymer have not had good years. Danny Willett, Shane Lowry, Thomas Pieters, Bernd Wiesberger and Tommy Fleetwood are among the fresh faces out to take their places. “There’s a new breed of US player coming through, highlighted by Jordan Spieth,” Clarke said. “Davis is going to have a new team but a very, very strong team. On US soil, we’re under no illusions how hard it’s going to be. But we’re going to have a very strong Europe team as well, which will make it a wonderful event.” The excitement builds. Twelve months and counting.

And what a way it was for that partnership to begin. It proved a memorable match, one that again captured the imagination and attention of the sporting world. Europe fully deserved their victory, showing the combination of world-class individuals and outstanding teamwork that makes the Ryder Cup stand out. Standard Life Investments shares the belief in bringing specialist talent together for the common cause. It agrees that no individual, however good, can excel without the help and commitment of dedicated partners. These principles have helped it to earn a reputation as a leading global asset management company. One year from today, the 41st Ryder Cup will begin at Hazeltine in Minnesota. Standard Life Investments has been working closely with Ryder Cup Europe and the PGA of America to make sure that next year’s event continues in the same successful vein. Standard Life Investments believes in shared insight, rigorous research and a strong team ethos. Those values will be on show again at Hazeltine this time next year. May the best team win.
