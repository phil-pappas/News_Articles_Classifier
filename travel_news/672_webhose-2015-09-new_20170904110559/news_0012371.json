Photo Courtesy of U.S. Department of Agriculture \nSweet potatoes are another favorite starch staple throughout Polynesia and all Hawaii luaus. Ideally for this recipe use Hawaiian purple sweet potatoes, also known as Okinawan potatoes which are native to the Japanese island of Okinawa. \nHawaiian purple sweet potatoes are not actually potatoes. They are a member of the morning glory family and are called 'uala in Hawaiian. \nThese “potatoes” actually originated in South America and were first brought to Japan sometime before 1605, most likely by Spanish or Portuguese traders. The plant grew well in the rich soil of Okinawa and the Japanese islands and eventually made its way to Hawaii, most likely with some of the original Japanese plantation workers. \nHawaiian sweet potatoes are creamy and much more flavorful than the sweet potatoes found on the mainland. They are high in fiber, vitamin C as well as antioxidants. The antioxidant known as anthocyanin is the pigment which is responsible for the brilliant purple color of the flesh. It is the same pigment that gives blueberries, red grapes and red cabbage their color. 1 \nThis recipe is courtesy of the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu. These potatoes are served at their Ali'i Luau. \nFor more information on the Polynesian Cultural Luau Center Ali'i Luau visit their website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T07:44:29.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
