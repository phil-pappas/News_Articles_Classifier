While weight and warmth are of importance to everyone in the backcountry, weight-to-comfort ratios and exact temperature needs will vary by person. The brand new Eureka Spero line is a traditional mummy bag shape, and comes in temp ratings from 20 degrees to 30 degrees F, for both men and women. If you like a roomy toe box and space to stretch in your sleeping bag, look elsewhere. You’ll take a hit in the size and weight department, but maybe that’s worth it to you. I know several backcountry enthusiasts who’d agree. However, if size and weight matter but warmth is also paramount, the Spero may fit the bill perfectly. Categorized as a technical bag, the Spero was created for the backpacker, not the casual camper. I tested out the Spero 20 for women . After receiving it in January, it was immediately whisked from my hands (as happens often) by my teen son, who wanted to try it out on an overnight in an unheated shelter outdoors in (fairly mild) Oregon weather. He declared it too warm, so I tried it out yurt camping, and felt just right. I like that despite featuring a fairly snug mummy design, the Spero’s toe-to-hood zipper opens on an arc, which allows for a greater mouth to climb into and out of. It also helps to regulate temperature during the night. The Spero is EN-rated, and has a snug anatomic hood design that further traps heat. It’s synthetic, not down, and uses shingle construction (the insulation is sewn into the bag in an overlapping pattern, like shingles on a house). You get a full-length draft tube, the insulated hood mentioned above, and chin baffles. Once in the bag, you’re very snug. Of course, the Spero comes with a compression stuff sack, and the women’s version has a more generous hip curvature. It’s billed as Eureka’s lightest and most compressible bag yet, and weighs in at under three pounds, 13 ounces. The fill weight is one pound, six ounces. These weights vary slightly, of course, depending on model. For instance, if you can sacrifice on the warmth level, the women’s 30 degree version weighs in at only two pounds, six ounces. Pick up the Spero in either regular or long and either 20 degrees or 30 degrees (for men and women). The women’s Spero 20 I tested retails for $129 and can be found on Sunny Sports or Amazon . There’s also a “regular” version for men for the same price. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T13:06:27.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
