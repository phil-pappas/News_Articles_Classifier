The Vegas Line consists of games optimized for mobile play, developed by designers with experience in both American land-based slots and in European online gaming. Since land-based Casino resorts are increasingly offering Social Casinos to better attract or retain players, there is significant demand for the digital games offered by this new product line.\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150903/263473LOGO )\nMobile users represent the largest growth segment in Social Casino gaming. Optimized for play on tablets and phones, and with games designed for optimal mobile game play, the Vegas Line slots are mobile ready.\n\"Mobile players respond best to games with great usability and compelling experience,\" said Geoffrey Hansen , Managing Director of Genesis. \"We refined our user interface and paired that with proven game features. Our customers need games that players will get into quickly and provide an experience that will keep them coming back.\"\nGenesis Gaming previously provided white label slot content for top tier social casinos, deploying over 60 games in under a three-year period.\nInitially launching with ten games in 2015, the catalogue will grow by ten games per quarter through 2016, providing the continuous renewal of titles needed to support the on-going marketing and promotional needs of social casinos. The Vegas Line is designed to provide our customers with a growing portfolio featuring a diverse range of game play, themes and art styles.\nBoth online, app-based social casinos and social casinos developed by land-based casinos require constant catalogue growth to acquire and maintain players, evidenced by many social casinos that add new titles every two weeks. The depth of the Vegas Line catalogue allows for each social casino to choose the games that are the best fit for their players, whether that is games inspired by land-based casino hits or those built on successful European game play.\n\"We choose game themes based on the most popular themes in social casinos,\" said Scott Sims , Head of Global Design at Genesis Gaming. \"Then we combined that with our first-hand knowledge of what works in social gaming and our years designing games for the European market. And of course, with our on-going work in land-based gaming.\"\nThe Vegas Line series of games is being announced at the Gaming Now conference, taking place September 2-3 in Las Vegas . Genesis Gaming plans to announce further details on this new product line at the Global Gaming Expo, September 29-October 1 .
