Under the Scheme, young people of Hong Kong may apply for a Working Holiday Authorisation to Ireland, and vice versa. The purpose of the Scheme is to broaden the horizons of young people. It provides an opportunity for young people to gain first-hand living experience in a foreign culture while they are on holiday in Ireland and to supplement their funds through incidental employment.\nSuccessful applicants from Hong Kong will be issued an Irish Working Holiday Authorisation. A Working Holiday Authorisation is a multiple entry visa valid for a one-year stay in Ireland from the date of entry. During your stay, you can take up short-term employment of not more than three months with any one employer. There are currently 100 places per year available under this scheme.\nIrish people interested in applying for the Working Holiday Scheme should review the requirements set out by the Hong Kong Immigration Department and contact the Chinese Embassy in Dublin to make your application.\nEligibility\nTo obtain an Irish Working Holiday Authorisation you must: be a resident of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and be ordinarily resident in the HKSAR at the time of application and visa issue, and have a valid HKSAR or BNO passport; intend primarily to holiday in Ireland; be aged between 18 and 30 (inclusive) and not be accompanied by dependent children; have at least HKD 25,000 and have a return or onward ticket; or HKD 35,000 in the absence of a return or onward ticket when you arrive in Ireland; and hold a year’s valid medical insurance .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:15:01.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
