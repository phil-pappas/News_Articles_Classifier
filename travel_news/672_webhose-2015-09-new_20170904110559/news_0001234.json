They were required to have taken at least one overnight holiday. \n\nSpeaking to TTG Asia e-Daily on the sidelines of the PATA Technology Forum on September 6, Phocuswright’s research analyst, Asia-Pacific, Chetan Kapoor, said: “40 per cent of travel bookings in India are now made online. Consumers have become confident and are embracing the Internet as a means to discover prices and information. We expect the share to reach 50 per cent in the next four years.” \n\nSharing more details on the study, Kapoor said OTAs are top choices for travel information and two out of three travellers are buying pre-packaged tours online. \n\nOffline travel consultants in India are, however, not perturbed by the shift in buying behaviour and growing share of the online travel segment, believing that the market is big enough for everyone. \n\nDeepak Narula, managing director of Aman Travel Group, said: “Indian travel business is growing so there is room for both online and offline agencies. Indian travellers want excellent services and competitive prices. An offline consultant who can provide these will survive.” \n\nRecognising that “online business is a reality that offline consultants cannot ignore”, Ranjan Kumar Mishra, managing director of Odisha-based Eastern Voyage, advised small-sized tour operators to “focus on alternative revenue streams such as travel insurance to survive”. \n\nSome hoteliers have also said that offline agencies remain a key channel for their business and will continue to be so in the coming years. \n\n“We have tie-ups with many OTAs and generate good business through them. However, offline agencies are giving us healthy MICE business. Furthermore, hotels must depend on different (channels),” said Debashis Dutta, associate director, sales and marketing with The Golden Palms Hotel & Spa, Bangalore.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:24:26.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
