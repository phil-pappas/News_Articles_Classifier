She said it was like meeting an old friend and Francis hugged the children.\n\"We couldn't believe it. They called us this morning (and) we were like in shock,\" she said after Sunday night's Mass. \"It is like being with an old friend. He was so warm. He told us we were crazy. He made jokes.\nRelated Stories Pope: Bishops who covered up for abuse guilty of wrongdoing Pope uses popularity to chart new direction for church & US \"The children got to hug him a lot. They couldn't leave him. Not at all protocol, not at all formal, it was like being with a friend.\"\nWalker and Zemborain quit their jobs in food service and marketing to lead their children on the unforgettable tour of the Americas, using savings and soliciting donations to fund the trip to the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia.\nAlong the way they made 12 border crossings and stayed with dozens of host families, did lots of sightseeing and documented the trip online. They schooled their children — Cala, 12; Dimas, 8; Mia, 5; and Carmin, 3 — with the help of a distance learning program.\nThe family said they got a call at 6 a.m. Sunday that Francis wanted to meet with them at the Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary, where he stayed this weekend.\nFrancis told the family he had been following their trip, they wrote in a Facebook post.\nZemborain, Walker and the kids plan to continue traveling until November, when they will fly home from Miami. They were going to send the van by ship, but then a relative volunteered to drive it back to Buenos Aires from Florida.\nFrancis celebrated Mass on Sunday that drew hundreds of thousands to downtown Philadelphia.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the name of the Vatican spokesman is Federico, not Frederico.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/15/8704862/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/37/8706036/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T07:56:05.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
