First class comforts: Qantas pyjamas and slippers — another Buzz creation. Pic: Qantas Source: Supplied \nAN Australian company that draws inspiration from “people watching” has become the go-to agency for international airlines seeking innovative ways to keep passengers happy and loyal. \nNow in its 16th year, Buzz got its break creating kids’ packs for Qantas on domestic and international flights. \nThe Melbourne-based company now works with 16 carriers including American Airlines, Delta and Emirates, supplying everything from First and Business Class amenity kits to economy class blankets made from recycled plastic.

We want people to see the value in it, we want people to desire it and to want it.” Kate Spade amenity kits are much revered by Qantas business class passengers Source: Supplied \nShe said a great example was the Kate Spade amenity kits they created for Qantas business class passengers. \n“You can do a kit that’s a pretty plain bag, they don’t cost a lot. But when you put the right brand on it, it could retail for $150,” she said. \n“I’ve been at a bar in Hong Kong where two people had the Kate Spade bag as their evening bag. \n“It’s all very well to have a very top tier luxury brand, but what Buzz does is find the new luxury must-haves. It’s not about big mainstream designers, it’s about niche producers.” Another Buzz creation — Delta amenity kits Source: Supplied \nAnother example was the Malin and Goetz products Buzz chose for Delta Airlines’ EliteBusiness kits. \n“It’s all very well to have a very top tier luxury brand but what Buzz does is find the new luxury must-haves,” Ms Davies said. \n“It’s a balance to find the right brand for the airline, and getting that fit right. Some brands don’t \nwant to be aligned with certain airlines.” \nKeeping little travellers entertained was another big part of Buzz’s business, with the company designing kids’ airline meals for Qatar, Korean and Singapore Airlines. \n“That’s how we got our start. We called ourselves the kids’ experts and went about proving that to be the case,” said Ms Davies. \n“A kids’ blanket, a seatbelt critter that encourages children to do up their seatbelt, jazzing up the meal service in a fun lunch box — it really makes a difference for the kids, and when they’re happy, so are their fellow travellers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:09:14.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
