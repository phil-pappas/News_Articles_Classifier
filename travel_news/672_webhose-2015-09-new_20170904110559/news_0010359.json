It doesn’t have to be financial support, support in terms of time is often most valued by these hard working local community groups.’\nThe ‘charity open afternoon’ event will take place between 12:30 – 2:30pm. Charities will each have a stall that business representatives can visit to find out more about what they do and how they can get involved.\n‘We are proud to have teamed up with St John Ambulance to create this event, the first of its kind in Jersey. We think it will be a brilliant opportunity for businesses and charities to engage, particularly as many businesses will be beginning to consider which charities they’d like to support in 2016. Success for us would be seeing some great long-term corporate-community partnerships forged,’ concluded Miss Crowther.\nSource: Jersey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:42:50.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
