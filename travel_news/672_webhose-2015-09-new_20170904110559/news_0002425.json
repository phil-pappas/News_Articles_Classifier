Through these events, which took place in the largest city of Japan, Tokyo, MMPRC aimed to attract and increase the arrivals from the Japanese market by also promoting the Visit Maldives Year campaign. \nThese events took place throughout this week at different locations in Japan and widely showcased the Maldivian culture to the Japanese market. There were cultural performances which took place at three separate events on August 26, 27 and 28. On the 26th, there was a performance of cultural dance at Akasaka Sacas, Tokyo, which is a high-traffic area where a lot of the consumer market gathers, making it a great platform to reach a large number of the general public. On the 27th, an event was held targeting the more high-end diplomats showcasing Boduberu and dance performances. The final show in Tokyo was on the 28th where a Boduberu group and cultural dancers performed together with top Japanese artists at the Odaiba Summer Fiesta, which is an annual Music Festival that takes place in Japan. Information about the destination was disseminated widely throughout the event with special focus on promoting VMY 2016. \nThrough these promotions, MMPRC can attract a large number of the market and in turn revive the market growth. While the Japanese market arrivals have shown unstable growth, the marketâ€™s growing trends for overseas travel and the interest of the Japanese to explore more tropical destinations prove its potential to grow with the right marketing reach. \nBased on the most recent statistics, a total of 2,228 Japanese tourists were recorded to have visited Maldives by June 2015. With these colorful celebrations in Tokyo, MMPRC hopes to gain the once top market to Maldives, as there is a lot of potential for growth from this market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T23:30:49.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
