His opposition to the ruling Communist Party of China is well known: in 2011, he was detained without charge for 81 days by China’s authorities. Video Recorder (2010) His passport was also confiscated, and only returned to him this summer. But what sort of art does this dissident actually produce? The answer is: art that, from first to last, is acerbic and political. For Ai, who spent 12 years living in America, where he imbibed the ideas of Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol, art is always a form of activism. His pair of handcuffs carved from jade or his marble sculpture of a surveillance camera – these are obviously political: the latter commemorates the more than 20 cameras trained on his studio-compound in Beijing. Part of Straight (2008-12) So is his moving, monumental installation Straight , in which straightened steel rods, used to reinforce concrete buildings and collected, mangled, from the site of the earthquake that devastated Sichuan in 2008, stand in for the victims of the natural disaster, which was exacerbated by the government’s cavalier attitude towards construction safety protocols. But even his series of Neolithic vases dipped in garish industrial paint have a political dimension – commenting upon the regime’s disregard, while ceaselessly striving for modernisation, towards China’s past. Coloured Vases (2006) There is no question that Ai is a courageous campaigner for human rights in China. The Royal Academy’s must-see exhibition reveals that he is also a subtle and effective conceptual artist, whose elegant, minimalist yet sometimes spectacular aesthetic belies the fiery power of his political stance. See Ai Weiwei until December 13 at the Royal Academy of Arts, London and receive reduced price entry with National Art Pass . Look out for... S.A.C.R.E.D., The powerful climax of the exhibition consists of six sturdy iron boxes each containing a meticulous diorama detailing another facet of the mundane brutality suffered by Ai during his 81-day detention in 2011.
