Unfortunately, getting to – and especially from – the stadium can be a bit of a hassle. It is served by a rather small mainline station which gets awfully crowded. Train Services to Twickenham depart from London Waterloo around every five minutes during peak times and take between 20 and 49 minutes to reach the station. Stops en route include Vauxhall (which connects with the Victoria Line), Clapham Junction (for the London Overground), Wandsworth Town, Barnes, Putney and Richmond (for the District Line and London Overground). Throughout the afternoon of big matches, trains will be extremely crowded and boarding at stops en route to Twickenham can involve a fair bit of pushing and shoving. Twickenham Station is a 10-minute walk from the stadium. Heading west, the line to Twickenham connects with Reading (a 58-minute journey), stopping at stations including Wokingham, Bracknell, Ascot, Egham and Staines. Travellers can go directly to Reading from stations including Bristol Temple Meads, Bath Spa, Swindon, Manchester Piccadilly, Stoke-On-Trent, Birmingham New Street, Coventry, Banbury, Oxford, Plymouth and Exeter St Davids. Getting the train home from Twickenham after the game can be a bit of scrum too, with queues of up to an hour not uncommon. Another option is to take the train to or from Richmond. It’s around a 25-minute walk from the stadium. Richmond is on the District Line and the London Overground, so is a convenient option for those coming from west and north-west London. Three of England's four pool fixtures take place at Twickenham Photo: GETTY Bus The 281, 267, 481, 681 and H20 each have regular services which pass close to the stadium. Alternatively, you can take the R68, R70, 33, 110, 290, H22 or 490 to Twickenham town centre and walk to the ground. The TfL website is the best place to plan your journey, but allow extra time as roads will be busy. A free RFU shuttle bus will run from stadium to Richmond Station and Hounslow Central (which is on the Piccadilly Line) after each game. For coach services to and from the capital, see National Express or Megabus . Car Parking is not permitted in the area surrounding the stadium on match days. However, those arriving by car can park at one of two off-site car parks, at Kempton Park Racecourse and Hounslow Civic Centre, from where a shuttle bus will take them to the ground. Spaces must be booked in advance at a cost of £20 per vehicle. Bicycle There are cycle parking facilities in the stadium’s South and North car parks and next to the Ticket Office in the south-east corner of the stadium. Alas, Boris Bikes haven’t reached the area yet. The ground is in south-west London, close to the Thames Photo: GETTY What about drinks before the game? Those wanting to soak up the atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of Twickenham have plenty of options, including The Shack 68, with a big beer garden just a stone’s throw from the station, The Cabbage Patch, where players from nearby Harlequins are known to occasionally celebrate after games, and The William Webb Ellis, named after the man who supposedly invented rugby. And food? If you’d rather not rely on the gauntlet of burger vans that line the route to the ground, your best bet is probably Richmond, which houses a branches of the ever-reliable Carluccio’s and Wagamama, as well as a Gaucho – because what could be more suitable ahead of a rugby game than a large helping of meat? The final takes place on October 31 Photo: GETTY Are there any decent hotels in the area? Our hotel expert, Fiona Duncan, recommends The Bingham and The Petersham , both in Richmond. The former occupies a Grade II-listed building and boasts gorgeous lawns leading to the Thames’s towpath and the peaceful river beyond. The latter also has river views and an impressive restaurant.
