The two-day competition is the opening event in the 2015 Verge New England Cyclocross Series, and is heralded as a top race in cyclocross.\nOften called the \"steeplechase\" of cycling, cyclocross represents \"everything that's good about cycling,\" says race promoter Paul Boudreau. This unique discipline is an entertaining mix of road racing, mountain biking and running on an obstacle-laden clover-leaf course that snakes through every corner of the park. The sport requires racers to fight for position while negotiating sharp turns, mud, sand, hills and hurdles, all at full speed for an hour. Cyclocross is demanding, challenging, and humbling for racers of all ages, men and women alike. In other words: it’s a great event for spectators.\nNew this year, the race welcomes title sponsor CRAFT Sportswear, a Swedish apparel company with United States headquarters in Beverly, and presenting sponsor Ipswich Ale Brewing.\n\"We're so fortunate to have such an iconic and prestigious race in our backyard, and having partnered with the event for a number of years, it's frankly about time we took this next step,\" said Eric Schenker, CEO of CRAFT Sportswear. \"This is our first major cycling event sponsorship in the United States, and will be a great addition to our other cycling sponsorships.\"\nIn addition to professional and elite racers, the CRAFT Gran Prix of Gloucester is an enormous draw for weekend warriors. Anyone can race (pre-registration is required), with competitors placed in fields of similar ages and ability levels. All racers – even beginners – compete on the same course as the top riders. The result is an event that attracts roughly 1,000 competitors each day.\nCyclocross is one of the most spectator-friendly bike-racing disciplines. Historic Stage Fort Park, overlooking Gloucester Harbor and its picturesque views of the Atlantic Ocean, provides a stunning venue. Fans can eat, shop, and learn more about cyclocross racing in the Expo, or sample craft brews at the Beer Garden. Families can enjoy the picnic area with grills and a playground for youngsters. There will also be a free kids' bike race for youngsters ages 12 and under.\nWHEN TO GO\n* Races start at 8 a.m. on both Saturday and Sunday, and run for the better part of the day. Both days finish with the showcase Pro (Elite Class) races from 3:00-5:00 pm.\n* A free Kids Race will be held Sunday at 2:20 p.m. Registration for the Kids Race will be the day of the race. Up-and-coming racers ages 5 to 12 are invited to compete.\n* The Ipswich Ale Brewing Beer Garden will be open from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. both Saturday and Sunday, where spectators can sample a variety of craft brews. The Expo will also be open both days, featuring a food court, cycling vendors, and local businesses.
