Daniel Radcliffe pipped Jamie Dornan to the number one spot in the male category Kerri-Ann Roper – 08 September 2015 08:51 AM\nRadcliffe, who made a name for himself playing the bespectacled wizard from JK Rowling’s books, said if he had to pick a reality show to do, then the BBC One show is top of his list.\n“I guess Strictly, because at least my mum and dad would be proud,” he told Radio Times. “But it’s not an option.”\nHe will soon be back on the small screen in BBC Two’s new factual drama, The Gamechangers.\n“It’s the story of the computer game Grand Theft Auto, which was a huge part of my life growing up.\n“I play Sam Houser, one of the guys who invented it. But I never had any idea about the detail of the trouble the guys got into.”\nSerious drama aside, he said his earliest childhood memories of TV was running home to watch The Simpsons – which he has subsequently been in.\nHe also revealed the show he misses the most when travelling is Come Dine With Me.\n“I watch a lot of it. It’s all down to the voiceover guy, Dave Lamb. Other versions in different countries just aren’t as good.”\nScientist\nHis latest movie project is Victor Frankenstein, which sees him starring alongside James McAvoy, playing Igor Strausman, protege to McAvoy’s scientist character Victor Frankenstein.\nSince Harry Potter ended in 2011, Radcliffe has gone on to star in what many have termed ‘darker roles’ for the wizard boy wonder.\nHe starred in the theatre show, Equus, in 2007, raising eyebrows somewhat as the role required him to go naked on stage. He’s also since starred in Kill Your Darlings and the horror movie, Woman in Black.\n“I’m very lucky, but there’s no grand career plan,” he said. “Outside of Harry Potter or The Hunger Games, those kind of films that have a built-in fan base, it’s impossible to know if a film is going to be successful.\n“So you just have to pick those you feel passionate about.”\nRelated Content Strictly's Siberian Siren won't tempt my Daniel - Majella", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/article31339775.ece/88278/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews_P-0f4b6fc6-a84a-43e4-af18-69d3e7b48f8b_I1.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-08T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T14:08:44.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
