Originally capital of the spice trade, Kerala is a fantasy land of pristine white beaches, networks of waterways, misty mountains, and plantations producing tea and rubber, cinnamon and cardamon, nutmeg and allspice. Tigers and elephants thrive on its preserves, and encounters with monkeys, butterflies, cormorants are every day events. Voyagers are remiss not to savor the many unspoiled charms of India's magical province. \nEXPANSIVE WHITE SAND BEACHES Gleaming white sand beaches s stretch up and down along Kerala's 350 mile long coastline.
