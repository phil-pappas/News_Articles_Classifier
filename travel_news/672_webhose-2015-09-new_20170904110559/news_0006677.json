The event is free and open to the public.\nA morning tour of RTA facilities is for members of the Rail Users Network, but not the general public, RTA said this afternoon. Plans are for participants to board the 7:37 a.m. Red Line to RTA's central rail maintenance facility at 6200 Grand Avenue. After a look at the operations and the rail yard, the group will reboard the Red Line for a trip to the new Little Italy Station .\nThe afternoon session at RTA headquarters will address the rail network's history and activities, the role played by RTA's local citizen advisory committee, the services that RTA and Amtrak provide and their plans for the future.\nAn hour is set aside for questions and comments from the audience.\nRichard Rudolph, chairman of the Rail Users Network, said its mission is two-fold: Seeking expansion of America's passenger rail lines and making the experience of riding trains more customer-friendly.\n\"Unfortunately, we have people in Congress who don't think rail is a priority,\" said Rudolph, who is a retired professor of sustainability and climate change at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.\nPrendersgast, of the Cleveland-based All Aboard Ohio, said now could be a pivotal moment for expanding passenger rail in Ohio.\nThe Federal Railroad Administration told Congress in August that it will lead multi-state feasibility studies of expanding short-distance (less than 750 miles) and long-distance passenger rail service in the Southeast and the Midwest, including Ohio. It represents the second push by FRA to make the country's rail lines interconnected and efficient across regions\nThe agency published the first multi-state plan in it history last October, looking at how to link emerging rail markets in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.\nThe U.S. Senate, with bi-partisan support, recently passed a Surface Transportation Program reauthorization that has a provision that would permit using federal money for expanding long-distance passenger rail without a host state having to sponsor the expansion. The House is expected to consider its own version of the reauthorization bill in coming weeks. \"With these ingredients coming together, the time is right for All Aboard Ohio to consider how best to use these opportunities for rail expansion in Ohio,\" Prendergast said.\nAll Board Ohio's directors recently recommended six rail expansions for the state, including extending Amtrak's Pennsylvania service (New York City-Philadelphia-Harrisburg-Pittsburgh) to Chicago by way of Youngstown, Cleveland, Toledo and Dearborn, Mich. Ridership is projected to increase 56 percent to 360,000 passengers a year. Prendergast said that's equivalent to seven full 737 jets or 16Â½ full long-distance buses per day.", "external_links": ["https://www.fra.dot.gov/eLib/details/L16023#p1_z5_gD_lPR_ksouthwest", "http://www.riderta.com/CAB", "http://allaboardohio.org/", "http://freepdfhosting.com/38886f65ec.pdf", "http://railusers.net/index.php?link=home", "https://www.fra.dot.gov/Page/P0001", "http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/374/876/Long%20Distance%20Trains.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-24T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T09:38:49.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
