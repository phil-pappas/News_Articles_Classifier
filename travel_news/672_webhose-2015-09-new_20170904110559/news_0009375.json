PUBLISHED: 13:25, Sat, Sep 5, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:33, Sat, Sep 5, 2015 GETTY Suranne Jones loves to plan ahead on holidays \nWHAT'S YOUR MOST MEMORABLE HOLIDAY? Rome and Florence. My mum is Catholic and always wanted to visit Rome, so we went with one of my best friends, actress Mikyla Dodd, and stayed in bed and breakfasts. I was gobsmacked by the Sistine Chapel - it was so vivid and engaging. We saw the Pope in St Peter's Square and went to the Colosseum. \nStanding in the ruins you sense just how amazing the Roman Empire was. Florence was magical too. I loved simple dishes like pasta with garlic sauce and, of course, the shops. I bought a very pricey suit which I still have 12 years on. \nAND YOUR WORST? When Laurence and I first got together we thought Paris would be romantic. He was travel writing so we were staying in three hotels in four days. But we were delayed on Eurostar, 10 hours before leaving then five hours on the train, and arrived really stressed. The George V was the highlight, one of the world's most beautiful hotels. Afternoon tea there was a saving grace. \nWHICH GADGET IS ESSENTIAL? My phone. I really like catching up with people when I'm on a lounger. My music's on it too. And I'm terrible at charging up my camera, so I just use the one on the phone. \nBEST HOLIDAY READ? Bette & Joan: The Divine Feud by Shaun Considine, a story about Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. It was brilliant, outrageous and hysterical. \nI couldn't believe the jealousy and what they did to each other in a Hollywood world that was beyond anything you can possibly imagine.

I have ants in my pants if I sit down for too long as I want to see what the world has to offer. I always plan ahead to find out where the locals go and where the nice restaurants are. \nWHERE WOULD YOU REVISIT? New York. Both times I've been it was in snow and had to wear thermals. We have to go back in summer. I love the shops and vibe in Greenwich Village. I could wander around forever. It would be great to do a play there. \nWHERE NEXT? Cornwall. I've been going since I was eight. There's a beautiful coastline and great seafood. I went to St Ives and Newquay to write recently. I love the film The Witches, set at The Headland Hotel on Fistral Beach. You have room to pack both bikini and wellies to cope with whatever weather throws at you! \nâ€¢ Suranne stars in BBC1's Doctor Foster, starting Wednesday, 9pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T17:14:53.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
