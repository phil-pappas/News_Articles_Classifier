Manuel Valls told CNN on Wednesday that solving the crisis could not be solved simply by receiving more and more refugees.

There are refugee camps -- in Lebanon, in Jordan, in Turkey -- receiving 4 to 5 million Syrians. And we're not going to receive 4 to 5 million Syrians, so the problem has to be dealt with at source,\" he said through an interpreter. \"These are very difficult subjects. And of course, in Syria, so long as we haven't found a political solution; so long as we haven't destroyed this terrorist group, Islamic State ; so long as we haven't got rid of Bashar Assad; we will not find a solution.\" He said he would address the French parliament on Tuesday to announce \"the objectives of France and that there will be strikes.\" A UN report has put the number of refugees fleeing Syria at more than a million. Around half are children Photo: AFP/Getty Images Earlier this week, Francois Hollande, the French president , said he had ordered reconnaisance flights to begin over Syria and that he was considering air strikes. France was the first country to join the US-led coalition conducting air strikes against Isil positions in Iraq. Until now, however, it has ruled out extending its air campaign to Syria for fear it would help the Assad regime. \"My responsibility is to ensure that we are informed as much as possible on the threats to our country,\" said Mr Hollande on Monday during his bi-annual news conference. \"So I have asked the defence minister that from tomorrow reconnaissance flights begin over Syria that will enable us to consider air strikes against Islamic State.\" Meanhile, Russia has been criticised by Western nations after Syrian officials confirmed President Vladimir Putin had sent more troops to support the embattled Assad regime. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:35:33.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
