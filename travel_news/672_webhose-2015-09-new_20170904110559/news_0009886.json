The event is due to last from about 12:20 pm local time to about 3:40 pm local time, which is GMT+4. The peak of the darkness is projected to take place around 2:10 pm, a perfect mid-day situation which will allow spectators to get the best sightings in return for their long journey to Reunion Island. \nThis French Indian Ocean island will be one of the best spots to see the eclipse and subsequently, thousands of additional visitors are expected, very likely taking up every single room to be had across Reunion Island. \nAnyone wishing to travel to the island, which is well connected to Europe by home airline Air Austral, Air France, and other international carriers, should, therefore, make early bookings and not wait too long before the fully-booked signs begin to appear. \nThe eclipse event is of the annular kind and occurs when the sun and moon are perfectly aligned and the apparent diameter of the moon, smaller than the apparent diameter of the sun, then covers the sun. The latter appears as a very bright ring around the lunar disk including showing the popular “Diamond ring.” \nReunion Island is hugely popular for its adventure activities and among volcanic eruption chasers, with the Piton de la Fournaise already at its fourth major eruption this year. The island gained added prominence when a few weeks ago a wing segment of missing flight MH370 was washed ashore on the eastern beaches of the island. \nFor more information about the island, its resorts, and tourism activities like whale and dolphin watching, and so much more, visit its website.
