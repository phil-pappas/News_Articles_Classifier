Companies that transport containers by truck, railroad or trailers can use the AT&T network to help them have a complete view of their inventory from departure to arrival.\nAccording to Machina Research, there will be 69 million M2M connections in the supply chain by 2023 with container tracking the biggest single area. 1 AT&T can work with businesses to develop a solution that helps them meet their container monitoring needs. Companies can use Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create intelligent container fleets. They can improve operations with information that's delivered based on specific business needs.\nHere's how it works. Each container has a monitoring device that collects data with sensors and sends it to a web portal. Managers can view the location of containers for cargo owners. Back-office workers can easily find containers. Drivers have the tools to be more productive because they have more information about their next load to pick up.\nShipping companies can quickly locate and send containers or trailers that are closest to the clients who need them. They're also able to identify customers that are keeping containers for longer time periods. They can improve the usage of containers and reduce their overall transportation spend.\nKey benefits include:\nMore Control – Receive timely alerts on containers or trailers that deviate from their expected location; identify containers that have been idle to optimize pool size; keep more accurate records of when cargo shipments depart and reach their destination. Custom Notifications – Know the status of container or trailer inventory, the safety of cargo, or excessive dwell time with custom alerts; detect if and where a container drops or impacts the cargo; evolve by adding a variety of sensors as your business needs change. Longer Battery Life – Each tracking device is solar powered and uses an industrial grade chargeable lithium ion battery. Shipping companies can provide years of continuous service without battery changes, reducing the total cost of ownership. \"Shipping companies are constantly moving their trailers and containers across the world,\" said Mike Troiano , vice president, Product Management, AT&T IoT Solutions. \"Our container monitoring solutions can help them know that a shipment will arrive on time. We're helping businesses better manage their distribution process and offer a service customers can depend on.\"\nWhether a container is in a nearby freight yard or moving around the world, knowing its location can help businesses minimize theft or loss. Companies that transport time-critical or valuable goods can monitor their cargo to ensure it's safe and arrives on time.\nAT&T develops IoT technology for industries like asset management, vehicle solutions, equipment and machinery, and smart cities. The solutions include smart meters, cargo tracking, connected cars and fleets as well as smart city street and traffic lights.\nFor more information on AT&T's IoT solutions, visit http://www.att.com/m2m .\n1 Machina Research, \"Supply Chain: strong revenue growth forecast due to demand for enhanced operational efficiency,\" ( November 2014 )\n*AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc.\nAbout AT&T\nAT&T Inc.
