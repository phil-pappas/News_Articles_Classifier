(Legoland Florida) What are your favorite healthy snacks at Disney, Universal and other Central Florida attractions? \nSnacking right isn't an easy feat when you're in a theme park. Temptation is everywhere. \nWe asked local theme parks -- Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld Orlando and Legoland Florida -- for guidance on some of their healthier snacking options. Nutritional information generally wasn't available, but the parks supplied us with varying ideas to enjoy the fun without the extra fat calories, and we did additional research ourselves.

Pictured is the Harambe Fruit Market at Disney's Animal Kingdom, which has one of the best selections we saw in any park. Anaheim Produce at Disney's Hollywood Studios also has an excellent selection. \nFresh fruits and vegetables -- whole and cut up -- are available around all the Disney theme parks.
