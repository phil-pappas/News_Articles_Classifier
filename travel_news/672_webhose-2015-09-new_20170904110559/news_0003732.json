Recovery needed.” If you’re an AA technician, these probably aren’t the words you most want to read when looking up the details of your next job. But for Essex-based recovery patrol Darren Foster, they gave eloquent expression to a callout that proved every bit as memorable as it was challenging. “I hadn’t been with the AA for long,” he remembers, “so I thought to begin with that it was a wind-up. But when I rang my supervisor he said it was genuine, so I got on with finding out what was going on.” When he arrived at the scene, a children’s entertainer had mislaid her seven-foot snake in her Mitsubishi Grandis. “It had slithered out of the pillow case she transported it in,” Mr Foster reports, “and was drawn to the warmth of the heater matrix, just below the windscreen.” That’s where the mammoth reptile had come to rest by the time Mr Foster arrived. “The heat had made its body expand,” he says, “so I knew that the only way I’d be able to recover it would be to remove the whole dashboard. There didn’t seem to be much choice, so I set to work.” As a result, I had to deal with the snake’s head while trying to wrestle it free A further aspect of the challenge was that the snake could only be pulled free of the car head-first. That’s because of the direction of its scales, meaning a backwards recovery would harm the creature and was therefore out of the question. “As a result,” Mr Foster observes, with admirable understatement, “I had to deal with the snake’s head while trying to wrestle it free.” Fortunately, boa constrictors aren’t venomous, relying as they do on their power to squeeze the life out of prey before eating it. But that didn’t stop Mr Foster feeling circumspect about the idea of becoming acquainted with the cold-blooded creature’s teeth. “The owner said a bite would feel just like a cat scratch,” he says. “But I wasn’t keen to find out. And by the time I did eventually get the snake out of the car, it was in a pretty foul temper.” That means Mr Foster didn’t rush to accept the owner’s offer of a cuddle with her pet before they went their separate ways. In fact, it was one job that he was pleased to get out of the way. “I love dealing with people in the line of my work,” he reports. “It’s probably the best thing about being on an AA patrol. But I’m less keen on dealing with snakes!” Even so, Mr Foster says the incident has stuck in his mind and given him a great story to share when people ask about his work. “I would say that working for the AA has expanded my mind no end,” he laughs. “I’ve dealt with so many different situations, and so many different types of people. It’s definitely true that the job offers a great deal of variety!” Spend more time laughing and less time worrying behind the wheel. With the AA on your side, you're covered when the unpredictable happens.
