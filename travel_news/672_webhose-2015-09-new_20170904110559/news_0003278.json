The course re-opened officially for guest play on September 1 st to rave reviews with all new TifEagle Bermudagrass greens and Celebration Bermudagrass on the fairways. Course conditions are exceptional for Fall golf package guests and members, and are expected to be pristine for the March PGA TOUR event.\nLegendary golfer Arnold Palmer commented, \"It is never an easy decision to close the golf course for the summer, knowing how much our members and guests enjoy playing here. However, we realized that the re-grassing would enhance the playing experience for everyone, including the PGA TOUR players who come here every March. Chris Flynn and his team have done an exceptional job getting the golf course in perfect condition for the upcoming season.\"\nChris Flynn , Director of Grounds at Bay Hill, worked closely with Bland Cooper, Competitions Agronomist for the PGA TOUR, insuring all improvements to the course resulted in a competitive golf product that meets the high Bay Hill standard. Cooper stated, \"TifEagle Bermudagrass has proven to be a superior putting surface as is evidenced by the number of PGA TOUR venues in Florida that use this preferred putting grass. It has a demonstrated track record in responding better to over-seeding, having better color, and is extremely cold hardy, drought tolerant and disease resistant.\" Flynn also shared, \"We just re-opened and have already received extremely favorable comments from our partners with the PGA TOUR, and our members and guests. Conditions on the course will be very firm and fast and we look forward to welcoming the finest players in the world to Bay Hill for another great competition next March.\"\nGolfers travel from around the world to experience the course that Arnold Palmer himself fell in love with many decades ago.
