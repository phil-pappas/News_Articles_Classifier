The new Apex clubs, which will be available to golfers by the end of the month, advance the Apex product line that is widely regarded as establishing a new performance standard in the iron category since it launched two years ago.\nIn the new Apex Irons, Callaway for the first time has precision engineered its industry-leading face cup technology into a forged iron to promote increased distance. This set also features a multi-piece construction with more offset in the longer irons, a more compact shape with less offset in shorter irons, and advanced forging for incredibly soft feel.\nThe new Apex Pro Irons are a forged performance set built specifically for skilled players. They incorporate Tour influenced shaping and design with a classic look, progressive flow weighting that optimizes Center of Gravity (CG) for playability and control, and soft feel that better players prefer.\nAnd the Apex Hybrid is the first hybrid for the Apex and Apex Pro player. It has a longer, more iron-like blade length with a Neutral CG bias, controlled ball flight, and workability from precision shaping. The new hybrids also deliver high ball speeds from a forged face cup, and an Internal Standing Wave that helps move the CG for versatility on various shots.\nLive now, the Callaway Apex webpage features a suite of multi-material content related to the new products, including product videos, imagery and more: www.callawaygolf.com/apex\nThe new Apex Irons (available lofts: 3-SW) and new Apex Pro Irons (available lofts: 3-AW) will be available at retail on October 30 , and golfers can pre-order them starting October 16 on Callawaygolf.com.
