Rather than grouping similar items on one isle, food and drinks that frequently form part of the same dish will be placed next to each other. Tinned tomatoes will be moved away from other tinned vegetables and placed with herbs, salt and spices, for example. Eggs, sugar, salt and other baking products will all be moved into the same isle, while olives will move away from canned vegetables and placed with the pickled onions and gherkins. Olives were originally brought to the UK in cans, hence their placement, while baking goods such as decorations, sugar and other cake essentials had been split between the bread area and tableware. The new layouts are being trialled at 50 stores across the country. If Tesco receives positive feedback it could roll out the plans to other stores. A spokesman for the supermarket said it knew customers were \"often pressed for time\" and the new layout would make life \"a little easier\". Tesco said it would also listen to ideas from shoppers themselves, such as putting snacks like peanuts and crisps near the beer, or having all Indian curry sauces, rice and naan bread in the same isle. dan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:42:26.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
