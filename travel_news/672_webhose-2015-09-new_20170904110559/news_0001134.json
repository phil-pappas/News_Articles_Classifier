Officials had to wait for equipment to arrive to move the stranded train. \nThe spokesman added there would be a full investigation into the incident and apologised to passengers for delays. \nLines were blocked through Eastleigh station for a short time but services to and from the South coast were badly disrupted. \nIt affected services to and from the South West to London Waterloo and Paddington, for commuters at Weymouth, Poole, Bournemouth, Southampton and as far as Portsmouth. \nSouth West Trains said trains towards Southampton and Fareham would need to stop at two signals and get permission to continue. This caused further delays and meant they would not run as many trains as normal through the station. \nTrains that normally run from Waterloo to Portsmouth via Eastleigh were not able to run and were replaced by a shuttle service, starting at Eastleigh.
