Conversations; we Tripolitains love to sit and talk. In coffee shops and restaurants people gather to discuss daily gossip, politics and everything that’s going on – from recent political events to who got married or divorced. These conversations are always against the background of traffic noise and car horns, and are often accompanied by the loud calls to prayer which are broadcast from the city’s numerous mosques.\nEveryone’s tuning into National station NRJ FM (we don’t really have local media). It plays the most up-to-date commercial American, European and local hits and mostly targets young adults. It offers a platform for listeners and briefs them with the latest national and international news and information about the best parties and concerts in the country.\nBest current venue A night out at Timmy’s. Photograph: Timmy's Timmy’s, a family-owned restaurant and bar, is located in an old stone house in the Mina district of Tripoli. It is surrounded by an outdoor garden and serves the best alcoholic cocktails in town. The place is always crowded with patrons of all different ages.\nIt hosts gigs by national and local bands and often has DJs spinning tunes. From time to time there’s a stand up comedian to make us laugh and on the upper floor is a space for art exhibitions.\nWho’s top of the playlist? The Brooklyn Folly. Moe Kabbara ’s first album, Understated Imperfections, was released in 2011 and soon after Kabbara started playing gigs in Tripoli and all over Lebanon.\nAfter graduating he moved to Canada where he formed a band called The Brooklyn Folly . They play gigs all over Canada and, when he returns to Lebanon, he perform all over this country too – especially in his hometown of Tripoli.\nWe’re also proud of El Rass , a rapper who works with Beiruti producer Munma. His most famous song is Min Kawkab El Fayhaa (From the Planet of Tripoli).\nBest local artist? Aly Bchennaty. Photograph: Aly Bchennaty Aly Bchennaty is a graphic designer who specialises in illustration, animation, corporate identities, typography and print publications. Besides his commercial work he creates revolutionary art pieces concerning the country and the region. Most of his work revolves around corruption, social injustice and regional turmoil portraying the resistance in Kobane, Sinjar and Gaza.\nThe look on the street Street style in Tripoli. Photograph: Khaled Most of the women in the city wear comfortable yet trendy clothes. During the hot days of summer it’s light cotton overalls, skirts, shirts and sandals.\nThe guys generally opt for jeans, t-shirts and canvas shoes – Converse, Superga and Vans are all popular. In winter it’s all about wool sweaters, stylish jackets and Timberland boots.\nWhat’s the big talking point? The recent garbage problem in Lebanon has catalysed a series of protests against the government . During one of these protests, the car of the minister of social affairs, Rachid Derbas (who is from Tripoli), was blocked by protesters.\nMinister Derbas subsequently filed a lawsuit against one of the protesters, Tarek Mallah . It turns out that Mallah had previously sued the Ministry of Social Affairs over some rape allegations in an orphanage belonging to the ministry.\nIn Tripoli we’re debating whether Derbas sued Mallah specifically to shut him up over the rape case or not.\nBest cultural Instagram Omar Haddad is a freelance photographer and graphic designer who lives and works in Tripoli. His Instagram photos reflect the beauty of Tripoli’s varied sites.\nWhat Tripoli does better than anywhere else Besides being famous for oriental sweets, Tripoli is very well known for its artisanal soap .\nThe Hassoun and Adra families have been producing artisanal soaps with healing and therapeutic qualities for years – around 600 years in the case of the Hassouns. So much so that people from all around the country, along with foreign visitors, stop at the soap factories to buy the best soaps in the region.\nComedy gold Love and War on a rooftop is a Tripolitan comedic play that’s touring Lebanon. It’s been written and is being played by ex-fighters from the city – previously enemies, now best friends – who took part in a conflict in the suburbs where confessional fights used to occur between Sunni and Alawite fighters .\nThe play is directed by Lucien Bourjeily and is a project of March NGO . It’s a very funny love story between a girl and boy from the two opposed sects and from the two opposed areas – Bab al-Tabbaneh and Jabal Mohsen. It’s acted in Tripolitain slang and it’s hilariously entertaining. The shows are always fully booked.\nMoment in history Tripoli’s car-free day. A few years ago, activists decided to organise a huge event to highlight the beauty of Tripoli, enhance tourism and promote a vision of the city as a healthy, green and ecological place.\nThe event took place on 13 November 2011 – it was a full day without any cars in the city. Instead the streets were filled with bikes, skateboards and other eco-friendly transportation means. There were lots of sporting activities, parades, kids’ activities and live music performances.\nBest street art Street art in Tripoli. Photograph: Khaled This piece is located on Achir Daye street, where most trendy restaurants and cafes are located. A collaboration between the hip artist Ali Rafei and the more old school graffiti artist Kimawi, it’s a mixture of styles.\nAli Rafei is a young street artist and activist from Tripoli whose work has made it to the capital, Beirut, and all over the country. Every Lebanese citizen remembers his drawing of a Lebanese policeman, smiling, with the word “corruption” written on his t-shirt – a clear message about the well-known corruption of the cops here in Lebanon . His drawings have earned him the title: the Banksy of Tripoli.\nFrom me Khaled Merheb is a lawyer and activist who was born and raised in Tripoli, Lebanon . He is a proud father to 8-year-old Oliver Ray. Over the years he has collaborated on many artistic and cultural projects in the city, including Tripoli Car Free City and Nawfal Palace winter cultural season.\nFive to follow Humans of Tripoli\nBlow
