The cards mark the MTA’s partnership with the United Nations on Caring for Climate, a voluntary initiative for business leadership to address the impact of human activity on the planet. They are also part of this year’s commemoration of Climate Week NYC and the 70th United Nations General Assembly meetings.\nPublic transportation systems such as the MTA play a vital role in helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New York State has the lowest per-capita energy emissions in the country because of the vital role public transit plays in the state to move millions of people each day. In 2007, the MTA formed a Blue Ribbon Commission on Sustainability to develop strategies to reduce per-rider energy consumption and environmental footprint. Addressing climate change and its effect on severe weather events has been an integral part of MTA operations and planning ever since, particularly as the MTA continues to recover from the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy.\nWhen Sandy hit the New York area in October 2012, its record surge severely damaged under-river tunnels, rail yards, and vital track and signals infrastructure needed to run subways and commuter rails safely. While the MTA continues to repair and rebuild the system, it is also working to fortify the network against anticipated extreme weather events that are occurring more frequently as the impact of human activity on the global climate deepens.\n“Working with a forum such as Caring for Climate is critically important to the mission of the MTA because it helps bring together experts and operations professionals to find meaningful solutions,” MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas F. Prendergast said. “We want to share best practices and learn from others what else we can do to reduce emissions and to make the MTA more resilient against future storms. These efforts make the MTA more efficient and their results affect every person around the world.”\nSource:- MTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T08:54:40.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
