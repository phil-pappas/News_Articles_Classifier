Ahead of its forthcoming jobs fair at the end of September, leading seasonaire website Natives.co.uk has revealed some of the best seasonaire stories. The tan trauma \n\"I had just arrived in Val d'Isère , France, for my first ski season and was super excited. I’d already sorted myself out some bar work, so decided to grab my skis and hit the slopes. The sun was pretty strong but I wasn’t worried – I was using sun cream. \nHowever, when I returned to the chalet to get ready for my first bar shift, I looked in the mirror and was met with what I can only describe as the worst goggle tan I have ever seen. \nI had no idea what to do – there wasn’t enough foundation and concealer in the whole of France to hide my sunburn, or the tan that came after. I would have cried off my shift but I needed the money, so I had to just suck it up and deal with the constant stick I would receive for the next two months. There wasn’t enough foundation and concealer in the whole of France to hide my tan Venia, Dundee \nI worked in the bar for my entire season and (as you can imagine) was persistently referred to as ‘tan girl’, ‘that English girl with the tan beard’ and every other tan-based nickname under the sun (pun intended). In fact, it got to the point where I wasn’t ever called by my actual name – I'm not even sure anyone remembered it. \nI loved the season, the resort and the bar so much I decided to return 12 months later. Now tan-less and a year wiser, I couldn’t wait to get back and see all the people I'd worked with. \nTantastic: Venia's \"tan beard\" lasted the whole ski season \nTo my surprise, no one recognised me. At all. Not a single person. \nAlthough one ski instructor who had visited the bar loads the previous year did strike up a conversation with me one day. He kept talking about how there was 'this really cute girl working here last year. Don’t remember her name, but she had the most epic ski tan…' \nOh well. At least he thought I was cute.\" \nVenla, Dundee The wardrobe malfunction \n\"Myself and three of my closest friends decided to say goodbye to the same old faces and predictable nights out in our small home town, and saved up to work a season in the mountains. \nWe had heard all these awesome stories about skiers hitting the slopes in fancy dress outfits, so we all bought the funniest onesies we could find. I opted for a cow suit, one of my friends went for a dinosaur and the other chose Sonic the Hedgehog. \n• How to get a job as a seasonaire \nThe day finally arrived and we loaded our cases into the back of my dad’s van and headed to the airport. But when we arrived at the check-in desk there was a problem. \nMy bag was too heavy and the price to increase the limit was £80. 'Think of all the drinks I could buy with that!' I thought, so managed to squeeze the cow suit into my hand luggage, headed through security and finally boarded the plane. \nWaiting at baggage claim at Geneva airport, one friend’s bag arrived safely off the carousel, then another. My heart was starting to beat a little faster than usual when, 45 minutes later, there was still no sign of mine. The worst had happened – my bag had gone to Zurich instead. \nUdderly miserable: James stuck in his cow suit for 48 hours \nWhich is why, for the first two days of my ski season, I was anxious, miserable and, to avoid being cold and too smelly, dressed as a cow. My friends have never let me forget it. \nThankfully, everything was fine two days later. I got my stuff and had the very best three months of my life. I would recommend it to anyone. \nMaybe not the cow suit bit though.\" \nJames, Ormskirk The bruised ego \n\"I’ve worked four seasons as a ski instructor; one in France, two in Italy and, most recently, one in Canada. I like to think of myself as a 'seasoned pro’, shall we say. \nOn my most recent season in Whistler , I was particularly excited to party one day as a few mates from home had just arrived, plus I had the next day off – I could celebrate safe in the knowledge that I wouldn’t have to teach with Jäger-head. \nI finished teaching early, met with my friends and we hit the Longhorn Saloon for a touch of après. I don’t know if it was the altitude, the cold or the fact that we skipped lunch and drank more shots of tequila than is medically advisable – but we got drunk. Fast. I was laughing so hard, I didn’t realise I was headed for a crash of my own. Right into a fir tree. BANG! Peter, Northampton \nMy friends were really keen to hit the slopes and I (apparently) was bragging about how amazing I was. We decided to grab our skis and go for it, and I took my camera along to get some shots of their ‘skills’. \nTo be fair, they weren't doing too badly. One of them was skiing particularly well and clocking up some serious speed. I managed to get alongside him and film the entire run… right up until his huge crash. \nI was laughing so hard, I didn’t realise I was headed for a crash of my own. Right into a fir tree. BANG! \nTree: 1. Cocky ski instructor: 0 \nThe resulting injuries – a broken wrist, cut to my cheek and very bruised ego – meant that was the last time I got to ski with my friends that week. But hey, who says you can’t chill out and drink to your heart's content with a broken wrist? \n(Apart from the doctor who gave me the prescription painkillers that is.)\" \nPeter, Northampton The Bake Off disaster \n\"I’d just had the most horrific break-up known to man (or woman) and was in no mood to work a season – I had originally planned to spend the winter in Chamonix with my now ex-boyfriend. \nBut after too many days spent alone watching The Notebook on repeat, I decided enough was enough. I was just going to go for it; I’d never worked a season and had been really excited to do it before the break-up. Plus my ex had now backed out, so I had nothing to lose. \nI arrived in Chamonix and was met with the most incredible views, awesome weather and, to cap it all, my chalet workplace had a hot tub. \nI was going to be working as a chalet host, cooking meals, keeping the place tidy and making sure guests were well looked after. However, I wouldn’t be doing it alone – someone had been hired at the last minute to replace my delightful ex. \n• Chalet girl: the life of a seasonaire \nSay hello to Adam, my new right-hand man and assistant chalet host for the next two months. Weirdly, he only lived about an hour away from me back home, so we had at least one thing to talk about on those long, tiring days. \nRock-hard meringue, anyone? \nOn our second day in resort the first guests arrived, a sweet family from Germany who thankfully spoke very good English (I had, unsurpisingly, forgotten the very minimal German I was taught in year 8). \nFor the first evening meal I wanted to show off the skills I’d learned on my cookery course, so I planned on making a strawberry pavlova from scratch. The family were very excited. \nIt was all going so well. My meringue mix made Alps-like peaks that even Paul Hollywood would've been proud of. I was feeling confident, even a little smug, about my prowess in the kitchen. \nAt least, right up until disaster struck – my oven had been too hot, so the meringue came out rock hard and weirdly misshapen. \nI panicked. Adam panicked. The family were waiting expectantly. What were we going to do? \nThen it struck me – everyone’s favourite, easy-to-make dessert… Eton Mess! It went down a storm. The family were delighted to be served an authentic English dessert. \nThe whole experience of doing a season was amazing, and I can't wait to do it again. \nAnd Adam? \nWe got engaged last Christmas.\" \nMelissa, Taunton \nThe Natives.co.uk jobs fair will be held at London West's Novotel on Saturday September 26 from 11am to 4pm.
