What we will offer is the best of both worlds.\n\"For example, all the current American coverage – including NASCAR and IndyCar – will still be available on the UK site,\" Klein added. \"But the way it is presented will be different. This will also allow us scope to develop our coverage of local UK series, giving them more visibility alongside our international content.\"\nThe new UK digital platform will be based out of the Motorsport.com office at 3 Shortlands, Suite 304B, London W6 8DA.\nAbout Motorsport.com\nFormed in 1994, Motorsport.com is a technologically advanced international network of online motorsports content featuring world-class digital distribution, video and interactive multimedia worldwide with news bureaus in 14 countries in 10 different languages, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nWebsites\nwww.motorsport.com\nwww.worldcarfans.com\nwww.motor1.com\nwww.motorsport.tv\nwww.360racing.com\nFacebook\nwww.facebook.com/motorsportcom\nTwitter\ntwitter.com/Motorsport\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150831/262511\n releases/motorsportcom-launches-united-kingdom-specific-digital-platform-300135531.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150831/262511", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/motorsportcom-launches-united-kingdom-specific-digital-platform-300135531.html", "http://www.motorsport.com/", "http://www.motor1.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.360racing.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150831/262511", "https://www.facebook.com/motorsportcom", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG89292&Transmission_Id=201509010900PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG89292&DateId=20150901", "https://twitter.com/Motorsport", "http://www.motorsport.tv/", "http://www.worldcarfans.com/"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:58:11.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
