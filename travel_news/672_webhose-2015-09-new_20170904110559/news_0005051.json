Hangover-free\nToday, Namibians insist that the quality of their beer prevents hangovers.\nOr, at least that's what they tell tourists to encourage them to drink more.\nThe Old Brewery complex in Windhoek was one of the first to put the purity law into practice in Namibia.\nProduction has long since moved to an industrial area -- the buildings have been repurposed into shops and a theater.\nThe original Boiler Room now houses a restaurant and bar, where the happy hour crowd fills the open-air courtyard.\nLater, velvet ropes will be strung along the sidewalk to handle music fans coming to see who's on stage, which could be spoken-word poets, local musicians or international successes like the Parlotones .\nInside a glass cabinet, old steins sit alongside early bottles and cans of Windhoek's eponymous beer.\nAt the bar, Windhoek flows freely in its three most common variants: draught, lager and light.\nAll three are golden-amber, easy-drinking beers that are go-to choices for cooling off on Namibia's hot and dry days.\nFor armchair travelers, these are the easiest to find overseas as well.\nWarehouse Theatre , 48 Tal Street Old Breweries Building, Windhoek Namibia;\nNamibia Breweries does make a limited run of Windhoek Special, which is usually less interesting than its occasional batches of maibocks or other specialty beers.\nIn Windhoek's bars, it's more likely the other local options will be the slightly darker Tafel Lager or Hansa Pilsner, which both originated in the coastal town of Swakopmund.\nIn winter, NamBrew produces Urbock and Urbock Draught.\nWith a dark, Munich barley malt, they're made only in May and last just through the chilly months.\nThese \"true bock\" beers are steeped in German tradition, with a more distinctive and flavorful taste than the country's lighter lagers.\nThey also have a higher alcohol content.\nBeer that tastes like tea\nOn the craftier side is Camelthorn Weizen, on tap when it's available.\nAlso an amber, it's made with ingredients imported from South Africa, Europe and the United States for a slightly different taste.\nCamelthorn started out as a promising independent brewer, but has been absorbed into the NamBrew empire.\nIt's experimented with different flavors, including rooiboos, the red bush popular for tea in southern Africa.\nReally comparing the quality of all of Namibia's beers to the imports requires a trip to Joe's Beer House.\nJoe's serves hearty food, which fits well with the beers.\nJoe's also boasts one of the biggest selections of game on any menu, anywhere: kudu loin, zebra steak, oryx schnitzel and crocodile skewers are just a sampling.\nTrophies of some of these same animals are mounted on the walls, alongside beer memorabilia and knickknacks from the owners' travels.\nIt's the kind of place that could easily slide into a caricature of itself as an African rest stop, but the total lack of irony keeps it genuine and warmhearted.\nAnd in all honesty, kudu are beautiful creatures, but they taste good too.\nJoe's Beer House , 160 Nelson Mandela Avenue Eros, Windhoek Namibia;", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150904124413-namibia-beer---4-large-169.jpg", "http://www.theparlotones.co.za/", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293821-d7369053-Reviews-m14631-Warehouse_Theatre-Windhoek_Khomas_Region.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150904124413-namibia-beer---4-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150904124413-namibia-beer---4-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150904124413-namibia-beer---4-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150904124413-namibia-beer---4-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150904124413-namibia-beer---4-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150904124413-namibia-beer---4-super-169.jpg", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293821-d806783-Reviews-m14631-Joe_s_Beer_House-Windhoek_Khomas_Region.html"], "published": "2015-09-04T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T12:02:28.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
