Nature really does come to the fore in Andalucía, with eagles and birdies on high as well as on the greens.\n \nAndalucía is a paradise for nature lovers, offering everything from lush forests and unspoilt coastal wetlands to Europe’s only desert area and the highest peaks in the Iberian Peninsula. It is also one of the leading Spanish regions for implementing measures to protect environmental heritage.\n \nAn impressive 18% of its territory is encompassed within more than 80 natural areas that include 24 natural parks and the national parks of Doñana – one of the most important refuges for the critically-endangered Iberian lynx – and the mountainous Sierra Nevada, both of which are UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, as well as 28 nature reserves and 32 natural sites that offer a diversity of landscapes and support a wide range of flora and fauna. The region’s natural areas are easy to explore, too, with most inland accommodation in Andalucía centred around its natural parks.\n \nWherever golfers choose to play in Andalucía they are close to its natural attractions and, in some instances, cheek by jowl with spectacular nature and wildlife.\n \nBordered by Portugal and neighbouring Andalucía provinces Seville and Cadiz, Huelva province contains several important nature areas, among them Doñana National Park. Doñana Golf is one of nine courses in Huelva and is situated on the edge of the national park from which it takes its name and just a few metres from the Atlantic Ocean. The 18-hole course enjoys wonderful natural surroundings and uses a lynx as its logo.\n \nIn the north of Huelva is another important nature area, the Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche Nature Reserve, which is popular with hikers. At the foot of it lies Corta Atalaya Golf, one of the oldest golf clubs in Spain. Founded by British engineers working at the nearby Rio Tinto mine in 1890 as the North Lode Golf Club, it was abandoned to make way for expansion of the huge Corta Atalaya open-cast pit and reopened under its present name and in a new location as a nine-hole course in 1992. The course is unusual in that it has earth fairways but grass greens.\nIn Huelva’s far west, Golf El Rompido is situated on the edge of the protected Piedras Marshlands. The fairways of Golf Nuevo Portil look out over both the Piedras Marshlands and the Flecha de El Rompido natural area. Isla Canela borders the vast Ayamonte marshes. Close by, the 27-hole Islantilla Resort is renowned for its bird life and nest boxes and feeders have been put around the course to increase the biodiversity of birds. Bird-watching tours operate from the resort, viewing species such as ospreys, spoonbills, greater flamingos, eagles, storks and bitterns.\n \nSanlucar Club de Campo, in Cadiz province, lies just to the east of the Doñana National Park and close to where the mighty Guadalquivir River meets the Atlantic. The gentle slopes of its fairways offer wonderful views of the river and Doñana.\n \nIn the forested Sotogrande estate in Cadiz, the Guadiaro River estuary is a protected reserve important for birds and wildlife. Sotogrande also has some of the region’s top golf courses.\n \nYou can even stay in intimate luxury surrounded by nature at some courses. Arcos Gardens Club de Golf, below the hilltop Arcos de la Frontera white village, is laid out amidst gnarled, old olive trees on hilly terrain giving superb views of the surrounding countryside and golfers can stay at its on-site boutique hotel. At Dehesa Montenmedio Golf & Country Club, in Vejer de la Frontera, its golf course is set amidst umbrella pines and is complemented by a hacienda-style boutique hotel, horse-riding and the open-air Contemporary Art Museum featuring works by well-known artists including James Turrell and Marina Abramovic.\n \nFormer Volvo Masters and Ryder Cup venue Valderrama is a certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary set within a forest of cork oak trees where resident fauna includes the European otter. Near neighbour La Reserva nestles between two valleys that are home to foxes, partridges and, as highlighted in its logo, owls. Almenara Golf Club’s undulating fairways and hilltop clubhouse look out over Valderrama, La Reserva and Sotogrande – Robert Trent Jones’ first course in Europe, opened more than 50 years ago – and the Sotogrande estate forest to the Mediterranean.\n \nNearby Alcadeisa Links Golf Resort has two golf courses giving glorious views of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean close to Finca La Alcaidesa environmental education complex, where activities include horse riding.\n \nLa Estancia Golf, opened in 2004 as Golf Meliá Sancti Petri but renamed and lengthened in 2009, is an inland links-style course in a natural setting with more than 25 species of birds. At nearby Novo Sancti Petri, which has 36 holes by the late, great Seve Ballesteros, each hole is being named after a type of bird. There are plans to add information display boards by tees similar to a programme already under way at the Barceló Montecastillo Golf & Sports Resort, where spring sightings can include nightingales, bee-eaters, black kites and white storks. The boards are being installed in conjunction with Seville-based Golf and Birds (www.golfandbirds.com), which offers golf and bird-watching experiences throughout Andalucía and which has also worked with Islantilla Resort.\n \nMeanwhile at Sherry Golf, near sherry capital Jerez, golfers who rue finding themselves in the signature bunker on the 6th hole might take a different view if they could see it from above – it is in the shape of a horse.\n \nClose to the historic city of Granada, the Granada Club de Golf and Santa Clara Golf Club Granada both offer golfers sweeping views of the towering Sierra Nevada peaks from their fairways, tees and greens and the chance to explore the national park by car or on foot after a round.\n \nThe Club de Campo de Cordoba, by the city of Cordoba, gives players a feeling of being at one with nature thanks to its setting with natural fairways surrounded by Mediterranean forest and the Sierra de Hornachuelos nearby. And in Jaen, the nine-hole Parque Deportivo La Garza course is set in a wilderness of holm oaks, eucalyptus and pine trees close to the Sierra de Andujar and Despeñaperros natural parks.\n \nAlmeria, Andalucía’s arid easternmost province, enjoys Europe’s warmest and sunniest climate and among its nine courses is the only desert course in Europe – Desert Springs Golf Club, with cacti, boulders, desert flowers and dried-up river beds lining its fairways.\n \nEven along the busy Costa del Sol, you can still play golf in natural settings and close to nature parks. Marbella’s Golf Valley has the highest concentration of courses, but in hilly surroundings towered over by La Concha, the seashell-shaped mountain that forms part of the Sierra de Las Nieves (Snow Mountains) nature reserve. Wildlife includes the Spanish ibex while among its flora are ancient specimens of Spanish fir trees.\n \nLa Cala Resort has a running track following the buggy paths around two of its three courses, besides horse riding, hiking and mountain biking trails in magnificent natural, mountain surroundings.\nClose to the city of Antequera inland from the beach resorts, golfers playing Antequera Golf can enjoy stunning views of the craggy Peña de los Enamorados mountain and rocky Torcal de Antequera nature reserve. Nature and golf also come together at Lauro Golf, where the fairways weave between ancient and newly- planted holm oaks in forested foothills behind Alhaurin, yet less than 25 minutes from Malaga’s airport.\n \nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:27:08.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
