The option is being explored by OCR, one of England's biggest exam boards, whose sister organisation is already using overseas markers for the international GCSE (IGCSE). The suggestion follows increasing demand for examiners after reforms such as the move towards end-of-year rather than modular exams have led to a spike in papers taken in the summer. The amount of scripts to be marked and graded in June and July is already much higher than before In an interview with the Times Educational Supplement (TES), Michael O'Sullivan, chief executive of OCR's sister company Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) said: \"I think the internationalisation of examiner supply is a big opportunity to relieve pressure on the system. \"The amount of scripts to be marked and graded in June and July is already much higher than before.\" CIE already uses markers in countries such as New Zealand, South Africa and Spain to mark the International GCSE (IGCSE). Mr O'Sullivan told the TES that he is chairing an \"examiner task force\" on the recruitment and retention of markers, which has been set up by OCR and CIE's parent company Cambridge Assessment. He said that CIE only uses examiners who are qualified teachers, who teach in English, but said he would not rule out any country from providing examiners for UK exam papers. Any overseas marker would have to go through the same checks as one in the UK, Mr O'Sullivan insisted, including asking them to mark papers from previous years to ensure they were up to standard. In a statement, an OCR spokesman said: \"OCR currently has no overseas examiners. However, it is an option being explored, especially as our technology makes it possible to tap into a pool of highly qualified examiners abroad.\" Exam boards, who traditionally rely on teaching staff to serve as markers, have previously warned that increasing workload pressures on teacher time mean that there are rising issues with recruiting enough examiners. OCR's outgoing chief executive Mark Dawe has previously said that the board, which currently has around 15,000 examiners, will need an extra 5,000 in 2016. British GCSE pupils could have papers marked in Spain or South Africa, plans by a leading exam board reveal Photo: PA Jill Stoke, an assessment expert at the ATL teaching union, told the publication: “It would be difficult for experienced teachers [overseas] to get to grips with the GCSE syllabus and marking criteria having not taught the qualification. There’s something important about examiners having taught the syllabus they’re marking because otherwise they’re going at it a bit cold.” “It will affect marking consistency” Neil Walker, a headteacher at Benfield School in Newcastle, also expressed his concerns about marking overseas. “Because of the move to linear exams I can see why boards have to think about it, but I think there will be difficulties applying the mark schemes consistently, especially in English and history where there are more nuances,” he says. “I find it worrying. They would have to take away face-to-face meetings between boards and markers.” telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:38:00.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
