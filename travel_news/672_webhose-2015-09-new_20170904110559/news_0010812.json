It is made of flank steak strips marinated in soy sauce, red peppers and water, dried in a dry box. It is a favorite at many Hawaiian luaus. \nLike many Hawaiian foods, Pipi Kauala has a foreign origin. History \nIn the l830â€™s John Palmer Parker , a western advisor to King Kamehameha, was awarded land on the Big Island of Hawaii. Parker was given permission to wrangle the maverick cows that were multiplying by the thousands on the islands. \nThe cows were all descendants of five black longhorn cattle that had been given to the king by George Vancouver in 1798. The king had put the cattle under kapu (taboo) and freed them to range over the island. Arrival of the Paniolos \nBy 1832, Parker contracted Mexican vaqueros (cowboys) to help with the cattle. They were called paniolos by the Hawaiians. With them they brought their fondness for dried beef which became known as pipikaula in Hawaiian. Asian Influence \nWith the influence of Japanese plantation workers on the Big Island, beef came to be marinated in soy sauce before it was, traditionally, dried in the sun in a screened box that was designed to keep the beef free of flies. \nThis recipe is courtesy of the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu. Pipi Kaula is served at their Ali'i Luau. \nFor more information on the Polynesian Cultural Luau Center Ali'i Luau visit their website .
