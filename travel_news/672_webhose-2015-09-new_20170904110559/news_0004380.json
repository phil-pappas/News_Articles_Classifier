The Q&A ran from noon to 12:45 p.m. Pacific time Wednesday. Thank you to Kenny Albert for participating, and thank you to all our readers who asked questions. You can read a full transcript of the chat above.\nKenny Albert joins The Seattle Times for a live chat as he prepares to call play-by-play action in Sunday’s Seahawks opener against the Rams. Son of famed broadcaster Marv Albert, Kenny Albert has been working in radio and TV since he was a teenager, and has been a mainstay on Fox sportscasts since 1994.\nToday, the 47-year-old New York native is the only person on Fox doing play-by-play for all four major sports. He is perhaps best known for calling hockey — he is the radio play-by-play man for the New York Rangers, has worked four Winter Olympics and called more than two dozen playoff NHL games this past spring — yet is also a big name in football, baseball, basketball and, now, even boxing.\n On Sunday in St. Louis, he is scheduled to team up with color commentator Daryl Johnston and sideline reporter Laura Okmin as the Seahawks open their 2015 season. As Rangers radio analyst Dave Maloney told The New York Times in May , Albert prepares diligently for every event he covers, and often uses just a fraction of his research on the air.\n“We affectionately call him Rain Man,” Maloney told the NYT. “He studies — and retains.”\nAlbert, who also has two uncles — Steve and Al — in the broadcasting business, has worked alongside such names as Howie Long, Terry Bradshaw, Troy Aikman, Walt “Clyde” Frazier, Joe Namath, Tony Siragusa, Joe Theismann and even Lou Piniella. Albert currently lives in New Jersey with his wife, Barbara, and his daughters Amanda and Sydney.\nNick Eaton : neaton@seattletimes.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/sports/hockey/kenny-albert-an-indomitable-broadcaster-keeps-a-grueling-pace-in-playoffs.html"], "published": "2015-09-09T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T01:51:57.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
