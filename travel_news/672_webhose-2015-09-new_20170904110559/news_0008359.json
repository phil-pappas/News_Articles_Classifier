A new museum in the port features the mass emigration from Europe, much of it Jewish, that passed through the city en route to the New World. While in the city’s Jewish quarter a different picture emerges: those who remained, linked to Antwerp by a traditional community and industry.\nAbout 20,000 Jews live in Antwerp. The community is largely Orthodox, with a significant number Hassidim. A walk through the diamond district, the hub of Jewish Antwerp, is like a visit to Europe’s last shtetl. Yiddish is often the language of choice. Long-bearded men with distinctive fur hats and black overcoats exchange greetings, while children ride bikes in front of jewelry shops, their long sidelocks swaying cheerfully.\nThe first Jews arrived in Antwerp from Spain and Portugal, following the expulsion in 1492. The Portuguese Synagogue recently celebrated its 100th anniversary and 500 years of the Antwerp Sephardic community. It is a small landmark, squeezed between commercial buildings in the district.\nIt was the mass emigration of Jews from Eastern Europe in late 19th Century that brought them to Antwerp, a leading port of embarkation to the US. Many Jews remained in Antwerp, when it became a key city in the diamond processing network, a business that has long been associated with Orthodox Jews. In fact, Antwerp came to be known as the diamond capital of Europe and its industry regarded as a Jewish trade.\nAny tour of Jewish Antwerp should take in the new Red Star Line Museum. Named after the famed shipping company, and located at a converted shed in the industrial port, the museum is a stunning feat of architecture and history, capturing the story of some two million emigrants who left Europe between 1870 and 1933. Over 500,000 were Jews who had left the Pale of Russia, pogroms and the pre-Holocaust persecution for America. It is the flip side of Ellis Island.\nRemnants of some well-known Jewish passengers are on display at the museum. Albert Einstein, traveling to the US in 1933 on the steamship Westernland, wrote his letter of resignation to the Prussian Academy of Sciences on Red Star Line stationary. A piano belonging to Irving Berlin, another emigrant sailing in 1893 is also in the exhibition. There are many touching photos of Jewish families, poor but hopeful, as they embark on their journey to the new world.\nIt is the square kilometer around Pelikanstaat, the main street of the diamond district, that is the hub of Jewish Antwerp. We walked it with Eli Ringer, the Chairman of “Fondation du Judaïsme de Belgique”. Born in Antwerp and a child survivor of the Holocaust, he has led the community through the most challenging of times. Pelikaanstaat is a kosher corner of Europe, lined with restaurants, butcheries, bakeries and cafes. There are many synagogues, Jewish day schools (over 95 percent enrollment in community), and social institutions. A monument to the victims of the Holocaust – over 10,000 Jews were deported from Antwerp - stands on a nearby corner.\nThere are also diamonds, though the industry is on the decline for Jewish technicians and traders. Jews, barred from the guilds and professions during the Middle Ages, were allowed to trade in gems. With the diamond rush in South Africa in the 19th Century, the industry took off and with it Jewish prosperity. Jews, almost always Orthodox, were cutters and polishers, traders and merchants of diamonds.\nRecently, however, the diamond processing business has gone east to India, where costs are much lower. That, in turn, has brought an influx of Indian traders to Antwerp and Pelikanstaat. And a decline in the number of Jews who are in the industry.\nThe Holocaust, the end of emigration era, and the shifting demographics of the diamond business have diminished the traditional Jewish population of Antwerp. For the observant Jews of Antwerp, who have managed to keep their community alive and traditions strong for hundreds of years, the economic future is uncertain. Still, as Eli Ringer notes, the Jews of Antwerp have confronted much greater challenges in its history. Their continuity is forged in faith, and not diamonds, a much more enduring value.\nJewish Community Information\nForum , Der Joodse Organisaties\nLange Herentalsestraat 48\n2018 Antwerp\ntel: +32 (0)3 231 58 48\nfax: +32 (0)3 232 52 62\nemail: fjo@fjo.\nwww.fjo.be\nRed Star Line Museum\nMontevideostraat 3\nTel. +32 3 206 03 64\nwww.redstarline.org\nPortuguese Synagogue\nHovenierstraat 3\nContact via the Forum\nAlso Visit:\nThe Central Train Station, adjacent to the Jewish district, is an architectural and transportation wonder.
