A cartoon poet, a speed painter, a performer, a designer and a musician, Avignon is best known for being the representative of the Cheap Art Movement.\nThe festival will be the most sustainable and “without barriers” event in the ‘City of Stones': people with disabilities will be able to follow a guided path featured by harsh and charming landscapes that will take them to discover a world millions of light years away from earth. Such a way has been traced by SassieMurgia organization, that promotes the total accessibility to Matera artistic and naturalistic heritage.\nOn October 8th the initiative “Dinner in the dark” will take place in the “Caveoso” Stone. It is a Grand Gala event that, organized by Sport amateur associations – The Italian Union of the Blind of Matera and Bari – will see guests served by blind waiters.\nMatera and Basilicata, where people have been living for eight thousand years and the time seems to run slower, have always been land of passage, exchange and transformation. They are not only “roots and paths” but also new ways of living water, popular religiosity and tourism.\nOn October 11th, while waiting for the night and saying goodbye to the balloons, MBF’s participants will be staring at the sky and will be admiring “Night Glow”, the unique show of balloons that, after sunset, will light up to the rhythm of music like giant light bulbs.\nThis event will end the Matera Balloon Festival and, at the same time, will launch “Naturarte”, an intense program of wildlife excursions aimed at exploring the Basilicata parks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:27:16.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
