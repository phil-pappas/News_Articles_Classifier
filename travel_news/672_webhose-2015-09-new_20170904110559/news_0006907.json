Life slows to a walking pace when cruising these liquid highways that once thronged with cargo vessels. Relax and enjoy rural views, industrial-era heritage, sunlight reflecting off water and the bird life; or exert yourself with operating locks and swing bridges. Most hire boats are steel narrowboats, but there are luxurious options, with skipper and crew. Here are 10 ideas for discovering Britain’s waterways. 1. The Avon Ring In the Avon Ring, a circuit of 109 miles and 131 locks, there are centuries of English history to explore. Moor opposite the Swan Theatre in Stratford upon Avon , near picturesque mills on the River Avon, visit Tewkesbury, cruise the majestic River Severn to Worcester, then ascend the longest flight of locks in Britain on the Worcester & Birmingham canal. Next, it’s a mile-long tunnel on to the Stratford upon Avon canal, where banks are a riot of colour in spring. There is the longest aqueduct on the English canals, Edstone. Time it right, when a Shakespeare’s Express steam train is passing, and you’ll be magically clouded in smoky steam, while passengers wave from cream and brown-liveried carriages. A four-berth narrowboat costs from £1,700 for a fortnight in April from Valley Cruises (01789 264224; valleycruises.co.uk ). If you don’t want to steer the boat, do the locks and self-cater, consider a hotel narrowboat with skipper and crew, such as four-passenger Ladyline. A week costs from £790 per person (07986 133122; ladylinehotelboats.co.uk ). • In pictures: great UK canal journeys 2. The Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal The only electric narrowboats to hire are on the isolated Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal in Wales. They are quieter and cleaner than diesel, so instead of a put-put accompanying your cruising, you purr along. Due to shallowness, there is a speed limit of 2mph, rather than 4mph on other canals, so you’ll have plenty of time to admire the Brecon Beacons. From Depot Lock, hike through beech woods, following the Brecon Beacons Way, up to the bracken-covered summit of Tor y Foel to gaze down on the Usk valley and the meandering canal. There are plenty of charging points along the five-lock, 33-mile stretch; a full charge lasts 18 miles. A four-berth electric narrowboat costs from £912 per week in April, including a day’s use of an electric Renault Twizy (01873 830001; castlenarrowboats.co.uk ). • The best hotels in Wales The Llangollen Canal in Wales Photo: AP/FOTOLIA 3. The Llangollen Canal This canal is like a living heritage museum. There is a steam railway, a horse-drawn narrowboat and, nearby, the “stream in the sky” that is Telford’s famous aqueduct. Pontcysyllte soars 126ft above the River Dee as it crosses the valley. Spectacular to admire, it’s almost terrifying when you cruise over in a narrowboat. The canal runs in a steel trough that has no barriers to one side. There is just a short steel lip between boat and a plummet to the valley floor. Holiday hire company Anglo Welsh has boats with cosy wood-burners. A long weekend winter break on the Llangollen with a couple of transits across the aqueduct, but no locks to operate, would be exciting in any weather. A two-berth narrowboat with wood-burner costs from £715 for a short break in April (01173 041122; anglowelsh.co.uk ). • In pictures: great UK canal journeys 4. The South Pennine Ring If you’re experienced narrowboaters and rise to a challenge, a circular route crossing the Pennines, not once but twice, could be the pinnacle of your achievement. In a journey of 197 locks over 71 miles, the South Pennine Ring follows two of three trans-Pennine canals: the Huddersfield Narrow and the Rochdale. After an unrelenting ascent, the Huddersfield Narrow stops climbing at an altitude of 645ft, making it the highest canal in Britain. It then burrows into a hillside for three miles, a dark squeeze of a passage that takes two hours – like climbing Everest, then going caving… in a boat. A chaperone from the Canal & River Trust accompanies you on board. A four-berth narrowboat costs from £1,604 for a fortnight in April from Shire Cruisers (01422 832712; shirecruisers.co.uk ). Cruises pass Henley (AP) Photo: AP 5. The Magna Carta barge European Waterways' immaculate 117ft converted Thirties cargo barge, complete with hot tub, underfloor heating and four spacious double cabins, is named Magna Carta . 2015 marked the 800th anniversary since King John’s Grand Charter was sealed at Runnymede, a Thames-side meadow, and cruises on the boat this year focused on this theme. More general itineraries include a golf cruise from London to Runnymede, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor, and a walking cruise that follows a similar itinerary.

Black Prince canal boat holidays This company offers trips along the UK's waterways from 10 bases, including Ely, the Peak District, and Falkirk, for journeys around Cambridge and Wicken Fen, Whaley Bridge and Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively. A seven night trip in a boat sleeping four from the Peak District base, which offers routes on the Cheshire Ring and the Four Counties Ring, is from £1,117 in April (01527 575115; black-prince.com ) Lough Erne, Northern Ireland Photo: AP/FOTOLIA 7. Lough Erne, Northern Ireland This is a maze of more than 150 islands and sheltered bays where you may be the only boat moored. At 40 miles long, “Lower” and “Upper” lakes are connected by the winding River Erne, where the medieval walled castle and county town of Enniskillen are set on an island. It’s almost as if this waterscape has been designed specifically for cruising holidays. Anglers and birders will have a field day. There are ruined monasteries and castles — and pubs with a lively buzz. You can hire a comfortable cruiser – with a wheelhouse in which you’re protected from the Emerald Isle’s erratic weather while you steer. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can cruise on to a canal that links to the Shannon. A two to four-berth cruiser costs roughly £575 per week (028 6632 3110; boat-holidays.info ) There are 42 miles of lock-free cruising on the Lancaster Canal Photo: AP/FOTOLIA 8. The Lancaster Canal This waterway hugs the coast so closely that you can watch waders on the shore of Morecambe Bay. It’s a pretty, quiet canal with the Lake District fells as a backdrop. Begun at the height of canal mania in 1792, this “cut” once climbed into Kendal. Tragically, construction of the M6 in the Sixties chopped the waterway in two and the northernmost section has been abandoned. The remaining navigation winds along contours of pastureland from Tewitfield, on the border of Cumbria, to Preston in Lancashire for 42 miles of lock-free cruising. Crabtree Narrowboats has a fleet of boats rated five-star by Visit England. A four-berth narrowboat costs from £735 for a week from Crabtree Narrowboats (01995 671712; crabtreenarrowboathire.com ) • The best hotels in the Lake District Photo: AP/FOTOLIA 9. Gloucester docks The best-preserved 19th-century docks in Britain are in Gloucester. Surrounded by listed warehouses, this inland harbour was once busy with ships carrying timber and corn from around the world. Cargo was transhipped on to the Severn and then the canals. Cruise from the docks on a four-night River Severn heritage trip aboard the four-star, 22-passenger river cruiser Edward Elgar. Other stops include Worcester Cathedral and the Norman abbey at Tewkesbury. From £650 per person; parking £5 a night (01452 410411; englishholidaycruises.co.uk ) • In pictures: great UK canal journeys Photo: AP/FOTOLIA 10. Kennet & Avon Waterway If you want more living space, consider the oxymoron of a widebeam narrowboat on a canal with wide locks. Topsy, 55ft long and 10ft wide, launched in 2014 on the Kennet & Avon waterway in Bath. There’s a record player, wood-burner, side hatches from which to feed the ducks, a full-sized spa bath, and a welcome hamper. The main bedroom opens to views of the canal. A perfect long weekend would be to pootle to Bradford on Avon, where you must try the boatman’s breakfast at the quirky Lock Inn café. Short breaks on Topsy cost from £550 (07785 333586; lazydazecruises.co.uk ) • The best hotels in Bath This article was originally published in 2008 and was updated in full on September 16, 2015.
