From teff they make the unique staple sourdough bread, enjira , which is slightly fermented and has a lemony taste. It’s a bit like a cross between flatbread and a pancake, and has the spongy texture of a crumpet – it has those porous holes that make it an ideal “plate” for other foods, such as spicy potato, chickpea, cabbage and lentil stew. Once you’ve eaten the stew on top, you eat the enjira itself, so there’s no waste – it’s an unusual experience. Mopane worms, the caterpillar of the nocturnal emperor moth, are part of the staple diet in many southern African rural areas and considered a delicacy in the cities. They can be eaten dried and crunchy, or soft and juicy in a tomato or peanut sauce. My favourite is ostrich – it’s just like an incredible fillet of beef but it’s really healthy, really low fat I was offered these in Zimbabwe but I couldn’t bring myself to try them. They pack a hefty nutritional punch but if – like me – you can’t quite face them, perhaps opt for biltong . This air-dried meat – usually beef, but also ostrich, kudu [a type of antelope] and various others – is like jerky but cut in slightly thicker strips, and is considered by many to be an undeniable part of the culture. You can get it in special biltong shops and choose your own chunk of meat, or you can get it ready packaged. It’s great for having with a drink – I find it’s a bit like peanuts in that it’s so moreish, you just keep going back for another bit. It’s the perfect snack food if you’re out on the road. Some of my very favourite restaurants are in Cape Town, or in the winelands surrounding Cape Town. You could spend a week here on a foodie-holiday and you’d be in heaven every mealtime. Vine time: South Africa boasts top-quality wine Photo: Agnieszka Gaul If you love really great food and you want to eat in a Michelin-standard restaurant but don’t want to pay the high prices you get in Europe, these restaurants offer Michelin-quality food, but at a fraction of the cost. You can have a three-course menu and a bottle of wine for the equivalent of £30, the same price as a meal at the pub here in the UK. You’ve got fantastic wine, meat, seafood, and the chefs are so creative. Some of them have their own vineyards, too, so you eat surrounded by the vines, drinking the wine – the whole experience is just amazing. But equally, you don’t have to go to that extreme to get amazing food: most restaurants in general are really good, particularly for meat such as ostrich, impala and zebra. My favourite is ostrich – it’s just like an incredible fillet of beef but it’s really healthy, really low fat. The mussels are wonderful too – I just can’t recommend Cape Town enough when it comes to food.
