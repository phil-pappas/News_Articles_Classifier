The track is nearly three times as long as the famous Yellowstone hotspot tracks on the North American continent.\nA volcanic chain occurs following persistent movement of a tectonic plate over these hotspots.\nAustralia has three volcanic chains which run along the eastern coast, but this new discovery is the most westerly.\nAustralia has only two active volcanoes, both off the mainland, located around 4,000 km south west of Perth, on Heard Island and McDonald Islands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:24:27.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
