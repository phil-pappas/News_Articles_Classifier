And what better way to cap off the visit than dining on an array of ‘Malaysia Truly Asia’ dishes such as Kampung Seafood Soup in batu lesung, Ayam Percik, Rendang Tok, Oriental Braised Soya Duck, Nasi Kerabu and many more, served up by the Centre’s award-winning culinary team. The four cultural experiences are part of a complimentary Cultural Showcase of eight Malaysian arts and crafts - batik painting, basket weaving, wood carving, songket weaving, pewter smithing, henna painting, Chinese calligraphy and gamelan – offered to event planners of all international association meetings under the Centre’s Conventions Value-Add Programme.
