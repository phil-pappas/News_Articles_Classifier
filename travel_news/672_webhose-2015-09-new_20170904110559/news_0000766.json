Three of the units are cottages with their own kitchens. Communal spaces include fireplaces in the lounge and on the outdoor patio. A restaurant will open later in winter. Rooms from $139, including breakfast. BANGLADESH BY BOAT Silversea , the luxury small-ship cruise line, says it will be the first ever to call at Bangladesh. In 2017, the 120-passenger Silver Discoverer will visit three Bangladeshi ports over four days during a 16-day sailing from Sri Lanka to India. In Chittagong, excursions will explore the lake country around the city, including a visit to the Rampahar-Sitapahar Wildlife Sanctuary and a cruise on Kaptai Lake. Elsewhere in the country, the ship will stop at Maheshkhali Island, using Zodiacs to reach small, untouristed communities on the rural island. It will also visit the Sundarbans, coastal wildlife reserves that protect one of the world’s largest mangrove forests and are a Unesco World Heritage Site. The trip departs Feb. 11, 2017, and fares start at $11,750 per person.
