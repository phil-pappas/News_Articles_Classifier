The US had initiated investigation against Infosys and its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for possible violations of H-1B visa rules in June. Response from TCS on the matter is awaited. Often used by information technology (IT) firms, an H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in speciality occupations. Indian IT firms are among the biggest recipients of H-1B visas as a significant chunk of revenues for the Indian outsourcing industry comes from the US.\n\"IT services companies like Infosys provide superior service, skill and scope from global centres of excellence, bringing value and technology innovations to enable American companies to be competitive and succeed,\" Infosys EVP and Head of Americas Sandeep Dadlani said. Infosys continues to actively recruit and hire talent in the US, but while there is a shortage of technology skills, Infosys is a responsible participant in the H-1B programme, he added. \"We do not practice or condone unfair or unethical H-1B visa practices. Our key priority is to operate fairly, ethically and with integrity, which is good business and what our clients expect,\" Dadlani said.\nInfosys shares were trading at Rs 1,065.65 apiece, marginally higher from yesterday's close on the BSE.\n business latest Infosys Also Read Google to build next-gen knowledge bank with 'complete' human knowledge After EPFO, Sebi pitches for more pension funds in market India Inc likely to give 10.6 per cent salary hike in 2015: Aon Hewitt Volatility part and parcel of capital markets: Jayant Sinha", "external_links": ["http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Infosys_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150908/business-latest/article/us-government-finds-no-violations-h1-b-visa-case-infosys", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://d2yhexj5rb8c94.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Infosys_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-08T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T10:00:52.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
