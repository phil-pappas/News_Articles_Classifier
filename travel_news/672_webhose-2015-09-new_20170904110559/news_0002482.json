Apart from the etiquette and schedule management, a good butler need to be knowledgeable about wine, maintain expensive glass and silverware and possess culinary and medical skills among others. Trainees at the British Butler Institute must complete 192 courses before they qualify and Williams will share some of the course during his visit. After the three-day whistle-stop tour the service will be open to the Chinese market on the e-commerce website. Then your very own Jeeves will be just a click away.
