The issue causing the most dissatisfaction was body mass index, with more than 57 per cent of respondents saying they felt motivated to make a change. The problem, claims Shaun Subel, director of strategy at VitalityHealth, is that they often don’t know how to go about it. \"If you look at the number of people who are motivated to change their weight and then compare it with the underlying behaviours of exercise and nutrition, you find a much lower percentage of people motivated to change those,\" he says. Indeed, according to the survey, the number of people wanting to change their level of physical activity was just over 52 per cent, and only 25 per cent of people felt that they could improve their diet. This demonstrates the disconnect between people’s desire to change their behaviour, and an understanding of what is needed to deliver the change. \"So it’s all about educating people about the outcome of changes in their behaviour,\" Subel says. Another area in which respondents expressed a strong wish to change their behaviour was smoking. While only 10 per cent of them are smokers, more than a third of those people were currently trying to stop or would like help to do it. Yet experience tells Subel that many of them will fail. Days of alcohol consumption per week by gender \"Over the course of a year, we have followed smokers among our VitalityHealth clients who expressed a desire to quit,\" he says. \"But only 38 per cent of them managed to do so.\" This figure, although low, is considerably higher than average because of the programmes and incentives that VitalityHealth offers to its members to support giving up smoking. When it came to alcohol consumption, however, just 2.5 per cent of participants expressed a desire to make a change. Even though a significant proportion – almost a fifth – recognised that they ought to modify their alcohol intake, they lacked the motivation to do so. Employee smoking habits So what can companies do to encourage employees to address these issues, which are at the root of such a wide array of health problems? One approach is to encourage peer participation and a healthy culture of competition. Holiday firm TUI UK & Ireland, which was recognised as the most improved company, deploys staff health champions to motivate colleagues and organise competitions. Others find that the carrot works better than the stick. At chocolate maker Lindt & Sprungli, for example, staff are offered a personal incentive worth £100 towards helping them achieve a personal goal outside of work, such as entry fees for a marathon or yoga lessons. Perhaps most important of all, says Subel, is that the tone must be set at the top of the organisation. \"It doesn’t help when your line manager is telling you to get healthy if the CEO is not engaging in his own health.\" What is clear from this research, is that there are significant numbers of people who would like to change at least one aspect of their behaviour, given the right support. The challenge for employers is to identify the most effective interventions to drive those changes, and to communicate those initiatives successfully to their workforce.
