With the rise of the mobile workforce and the need to stay connected while on the move, the technology requirements for events and meetings have evolved.”\nHe added that, as the winning conference venue, the Centre has the size and capabilities to handle what different conferences require in a bespoke manner while its infrastructure also “differentiates the venue by giving delegates an experience they would not forget.”\nSource:-Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T06:12:35.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
