PROUD endorses training programmes provided by General Aviation associations and bodies if they meet certain criteria – such as the LAA’s Wings Award Scheme.\nOpen to all qualified pilots of aeroplanes or rotorcraft whether an LAA member or not, the Wings Award Scheme encourages the development of pilot knowledge, skills and attitudes by offering a series of challenges and activities to broaden pilots’ activities and interests; create additional skills via further training and qualification, encourage personal development and flight safety awareness, and set extended navigational challenges.\nPROUD recognition of the LAA’s training provision follows similar endorsement of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) education and skills development offering. The CAA said it was keen for other GA organisations to join the LAA and AOPA as part of the PROUD scheme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:38:57.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
