These are nobel aims, but ones which inevitably fall by the wayside the second you have a late night. It can be very difficult to catch up - or keep motivated - when the deadlines being to appear. Make sure you set yourself on the right path when lectures start by following these simple steps. Plan on paper \"From the outset, you need to get a clear understanding of what’s needed from your course – the lectures, seminars and essay deadlines. Record all of these on a planner. Next, work backwards from them, and note down exactly when you’ll do the work,\" says Clare Evans, author of Time Management For Dummies. \"On the same planner you should record any big social events and also schedule in time for fun so you can plan in advance to make the most of it.\" Normally use a calendar on your phone? Go old school. “Having a paper planner for the year stuck on your wall can help you to have a better overview. You’ll more easily spot if you’ve got enough time to work on a deadline. And if you’re drowning in an essay, you’ll be motivated by looking at all the social events coming up,\" says Evans. Play to your strengths \"Block out ‘working hours’ like you would in a job,\" suggests productivity expert Rosie Gray. \"Of course, sometimes you’ll take less time, and can relish breaking off early. (At other points, such as before exams, you may have to do ‘overtime’). \"Keeping those blocks clear means you’ll never be landed with a big piece of work with no time to do it. Sticking to roughly the same days and times for study and fun each week can help you get into a routine. Plus it’s good training for the world of work.\" So how do you decide when to work and play? \"We all have a natural body clock, and it’s hard to fight it,\" says Gray. \"Think about when you’re at your best. When you wake up in the morning do you feel energised, or are you groggy and reaching for a caffeine hit? Use whatever time of day you’re most alert to ‘clock on’ – whether that’s 8am or 12pm.\" Block out 'working hours' like you would in a job Photo: Alamy Use the 'half again' rule It can be tough to estimate how long a piece of work will take you. \"It’s not that we’re bad at calculating it, it’s just that we don’t factor in things like getting ill or a book we need from the library not being there,\" says Gray. \"As a rule of thumb, decide how long you think a task will take, then add on half of that time again. That’s what you should schedule into your planner. \"When you’re finished, record how long the task actually took and make a note, so you have a better gauge for next time. Break it down \"You can only focus your attention on a task for a certain amount of time before becoming distracted. In many schools, lessons last 45 minutes, so you’ve probably developed the discipline of concentrating for bursts that long. \"So break your study sessions down into chunks of that length – or shorter,” suggests Gray. “Then slowly train yourself to focus for longer. Add five minutes on to your work sessions every week and see if you can cope with the extra. Build until you reach what feels like your effective maximum.” Keep your promises \"Plan rewards for yourself after doing pieces of work, whether that’s a walk in the park or watching your favourite TV show – and stick to them,” says Gray. “Sometimes once the work is over you tell yourself you don’t really need the treat and can plough on with the next task. But then why would your brain believe you next time? It’s important to keep promises to yourself.” Productivity 2.0 These clever apps and programmes could be key to picking up the pace: • Block selected websites for a set time with Cold Turkey and Self Control . • Tomighty is a free desktop timer for following the Pomodoro Technique.
