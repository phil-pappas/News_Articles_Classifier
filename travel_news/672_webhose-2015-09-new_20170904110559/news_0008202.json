A link is emailed to them for sharing.\nJapan is a key market for Tourism Australia with more than 320,000 Japanese visitors travelling here in the past year alone, contributing more than $1.4 billion in visitor spend.\nThe Gold Coast is one of the most popular and visited destinations among the Japanese in Australia, with emphasis being placed on Australia’s aquatic coastal experiences.\nThe selfie will take in the surrounding landscape of the Gold Coast.

Dates and locations for future “GIGA Selfie” events will be confirmed through the campaign website .\nThe event kicks off on the Gold Coast from 11am to 4pm on Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 September.", "external_links": ["http://www.australia.com/ja-jp/campaigns/gigaselfie.html", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/03/1227511/216735-d859191c-51f6-11e5-b4b9-6e09adcdd8b2.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T06:57:14.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
