YouTube \nAir France's 'Love is in the Air' video advert has been viewed over 50 million times. \nThe advert, directed by Paris-based creative agency BECT, is very Parisian in its simplicity and beauty. It draws the viewer into a fantasy world where perfectly turned out women swing gracefully to a remix of LA pop-synth group Glass Candy's 'Warm Winter.' \nThe ad was broadcast in France and various other countries around the world and was promoted on social networks like Vine. \nThe clip follows on from Air France's equally as ascetically pleasing inflight safety video. \n&amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T02:27:39.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
