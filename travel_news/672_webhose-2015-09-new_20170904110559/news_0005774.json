Writer Amy M Homes standing in front of the Yaddo Mansion.

And this is the room where Philip Roth wrote The Breast ,” marvelled author Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan, who journeyed to Yaddo to try and unlock the mysteries of her Singaporean childhood. \n“Using these things that people before me had used, and being in that environment every day, I had a lot to live up to,” she said, “to take yourself out of your own world and to see what comes out.” Inside the Yaddo Mansion, Arabic decor and stained glass Source: Supplied The rose garden is the only area open to the public.

He lived on the top floor of the estate’s 55-room mansion where Tiffany stained-glass windows, rose-shaped lamps, and vintage oil paintings line the walls of the manor home. \n“The wind blows eerily, doors creak, and the faint cheep of the bats cry in the towers above,” Capote wrote during his visit, before emerging weeks later with his debut novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms. \nThe mansion is the estate’s focal point. The grounds house several buildings where artists maintain private bedrooms and studios. Communal breakfasts and dinners are hosted in the medieval dining hall. Approximately 200 artists are granted free residency each year. \nIt was here William Carlos Williams, an American poet, completed his poem Paterson, and James T Farrell created the character Studs Lonigan; where Saul Bellow wrote Henderson The Rain King , James Baldwin produced Giovanni’s Room , and Mario Puzo worked on his Godfather saga. \nDuring her 11-week residency in 1959, Plath scripted several poems and wrote she had never in her life felt so peaceful. Artists diverse as David Sedaris and Leonard Bernstein, Rick Moody, Laurie Anderson and Henri Cartier-Bresson have all worked here during the past century.

The nonfiction or the fiction writer meanwhile hasn’t left his or her desk all day,” explained poet and nonfiction writer Eliza Griswold, standing next to a Steinway grand piano upon which Aaron Copland created compositions in the 1930s. \nStories of ghost sightings abound among some residents, undoubtedly fuelled by the knowledge of the tragic circumstances that have occurred in its history. \nYaddo founders Katrina and Spencer Trask suffered with the loss of all four children, each of whom died before reaching their teenage years. With no heir apparent, the couple bequeathed the lands for use by future artists — although Spencer Trask would be killed in a mysterious train crash before seeing the realisation of that dream. \nIn more earthly terms, the grounds have bore witness to their share of controversy, from rumours of illicit affairs and rowdy misbehaviours among some visiting artists, to an FBI raid of the estate in search of spies during America’s fear-driven paranoia of communism in the mid-20th century. \nThe land itself hearkens back to the late 1700s and early 1800s when a popular tavern on-site was frequented by literary men and scholars, former King of Spain Joseph Bonaparte, writer Washington Irving, and Edgar Allan Poe among them. \nPoe’s visit, which is disputed in some historical circles, was said to have occurred in the early 1840s when the then-landowner’s son claimed to have met the poet as he wandered among the estate’s lower ponds, reciting the phrases of a work-in-progress led by a resounding “Nevermore!” that echoed across the thick woods. \nWhether Poe’s visit is ultimately deemed historical fact or fable, the reality of Yaddo is that creative words to be shared with the world have risen from the landscape of this estate ever since.
