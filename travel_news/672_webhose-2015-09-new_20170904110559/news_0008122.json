So far, China has become one of the world's major lubricant producers and consumers. However, amid the low-speed growth of the global economy, China's lubricant market continued to decline for the past two years, with 2014's lubricant output falling by 3.6% year-on-year to 5.6866 million tons.\nInfluenced by the distribution of resources, China's lubricant industry presents obvious regional characteristics. In 2014, Liaoning , Shandong , and Shanghai ranked among the top three by lubricant output. Among them, Liaoning produced 1.3191 million tons, accounting for 23.2% of the total nationwide, and the output of Shandong and Shanghai were recorded at 824.9 kilotons and 496.4 kilotons, respectively.\nAt present, China's lubricant market is dominated by state-owned, foreign-funded, private-owned enterprises. As the leaders in China's lubricant industry, Sinopec (Great Wall Lubricant) and PetroChina (Kunlun Lubricant) represented a combined 48.7% market share in 2014, while transnational petroleum corporations e.g. Shell, BP, FUCHS, and Total occupied a 29.7% share.\nUpbeat about the outlook for China's lubricant market, and hoping to stabilize their share in China's lubricant market, the foreign giants that have long dominated China's high-end lubricant market are working to make layout and integration of China's lubricant business.\nIn November 2014 , Total, a French oil company, announced that it was integrating its lubricant business in China with COSCO Shipping. The company would put Total Lubricant ( China ) Co. as the main part, and make the companies in Guangzhou and Tianjin the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Total Lubricant ( China ); Guangzhou Ocean Shipping Co., a subsidiary of COSCO Shipping, will hold a 20% stake in the new Total Lubricant ( China ).\nIn June 2015 , Shell's eighth lubricant blending plant in China-Tianjin Lubricant Blending Plant (located in the Tianjin Nangang Industrial Park) was put into operation. The new plant has an annual output of 330 million liters and expansion capacity of 500 million liters.\nHowever, with the development of oil refining industry and the improvement of marketization, base oil supply bottlenecks will be eliminated, so that the local privately-owned enterprises, through years of efforts, will also hold an important position in some Chinese lubricant market segments. The companies like Jiangsu LOPAL Tech. Co. and Guangdong Delian Group Co. are the major Chinese automotive lubricant suppliers; Jiangsu Gaoke Petrochemical Company Limited, Dongguan Anmei Lubrication Technology Co., and Shandong Yuangen Petroleum Chemical, among others, have certain competitive advantages in China's industrial lubricant market segment.\nThe report highlights the following:\nOperation environment of China lubricant industry, including international market environment, domestic macro-economic environment, etc.;\nDevelopment status, market supply and demand, competitive landscape, import and export, growth prediction, etc. of China lubricant industry;\nMarket status, supply and demand, import and export, etc. of base oil and additives in China ;\nPolicies, market status, supply and demand, etc. of waste lubricants in China ;\nOperation, lubricant business, development prospects, etc. of 8 global and 8 Chinese lubricant companies.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3305880/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-lubricant-industry-report-2014-2018-300151107.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-lubricant-industry-report-2014-2018-300151107.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR14926&Transmission_Id=201509291657PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR14926&DateId=20150929", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/3305880/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T03:36:27.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
