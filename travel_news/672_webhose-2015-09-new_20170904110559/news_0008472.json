Let us find out about 5 mysterious places on earth that attract tourist curiosity and continue to amaze.\nOrchard Park, New York\nA flickering gold flame is often spotted by tourists behind the cascading waterfall of Shale Creek Preserve section of Chestnut Ridge Park. Some say it is an optical illusion, but geologists call it a macroseep of natural gas from the earth below. They say that a geological fault in the shale allowed 1 kilogram of methane gas to escape to the surface perhaps during the 20th century. Some visitor had the idea to set it alight. Whenever the flame gets extinguished by the water there is always some hiker who rekindles the flame.\nBlood Falls Antarctica\nThere is nothing different about the Blood Falls when visitors see it with their eyes, but later when you check your photos a mysterious red flow appears on the white snow. Geologists and microbiologist owe this redness to rich iron contents in the water that lends the red hue to the water. In a recent research it was revealed that at 1,300 feet beneath ice there is a sustained presence of sulphur and iron that makes the water have a blood red hue.\nFly Geyser, United States\nLocated in the Nevada Desert is a collection of three large colourful mounds which shoot five feet of water into the air. The Geyser was accidentally created in 1960 when heated geothermal water started spurting out of the well. Dissolved minerals began to accumulate and gradually built up into the large, coloured mounds. This place is located inside a private property and unfortunately tourists are not allowed to visit this place.\nBrij Raj Bhavan Palace, India\nIn Kota, Rajasthan, it is believed that the guards are slapped in the Brij Raj Bhavan Palace hotel whenever they doze off on duty. It is impossible to explain who does this as there is no one who is in sight. But as local lore would have it, there is a harmless ghost of Major Burton who was murdered by Indian sepoys during the Mutiny of 1857. With a cane in his hand the major haunts this 178 year old heritage hotel keeping tabs on sleeping guards on duty.\nPainted Hills of John Day Fossil Beds, Oregon, USA\nThe Painted Hills Unit of John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is located in Central Oregon approximately 70 miles east of Redmond, Oregon, and 9 miles northwest of Mitchell, Oregon. Multicolored hills, soaring cliffs and beautiful basins are due to tectonic forces and constant erosion taking place in the Bridge Creek Flora unit of the John Day Formation (approximately 32-35 million years old). Painted Hills named after the colorful layers of its hills corresponding to various geological eras, formed when the area was an ancient river floodplain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T14:02:56.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
