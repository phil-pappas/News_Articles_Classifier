The two new routes each operate twice a week, with Warsaw operating on Mondays and Fridays and Budapest on Tuesdays and Saturdays. \nWizz Air’s debut is a further boost for Birmingham Airport, which this year has recorded back-to-back record months and a particularly busy August – it also passed the 10m passenger mark for the first time in a rolling 12-month period on 27 August. \nThe airport serves more than 140 direct scheduled and charter routes and offers another 280 possible connections worldwide, giving passengers a choice of more than 400 direct or one-stop flights. \nIn July last year, it inaugurated a runway extension with a direct, fully-laden passenger flight to Beijing and over the past 10 years has invested more than £200m to develop its infrastructure. It now has the capacity to handle 36m passengers a year on its single runway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:40:22.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
