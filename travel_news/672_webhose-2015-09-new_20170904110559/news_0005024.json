Although there isn't a space formally dedicated to kicking about a ball as such, there is a French garden designed by Le Nôtre, a romantically-themed jardin anglais — complete with fountain, an \"island of love\", and temple dedicated to Venus — as well as a maze, a small forest, and the Condé museum, which has the second-largest collection of classical art in France, after the Louvre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:09:19.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
