Daley, citing security concerns following the 9/11 terror attacks, sent backhoes to carve X's into the Meigs Field runway. \nThe city spent $9.7 million to build the park, which features man-made hills, a 5-acre lagoon and a winding bike and pedestrian trail. There are also camping sites and areas for educational programming. \nNortherly Island is actually a peninsula linked by a land bridge that leads to the city's Museum Campus. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:02:58.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
