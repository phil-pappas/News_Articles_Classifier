The distances between the major cities is so great, with poor trans-continental road and rail networks, that flying is the only realistic way to travel. \n\"The economic potential of tourism in Africa is remarkable. According to our figures it will rival Asia Pacific for growth in the next decade. But for this to materialize or even be exceeded, it needs individual nations to work together on progressively implementing the Yamoussoukro Agreement signed over 25 years ago.” \n“The biggest single opportunity for Africa is to fully liberalize its air travel. The role of aviation in creating jobs and driving economic growth is too important to be ignored, particularly when restrained by one ministry’s mandate to protect a national airline. The industry requires a coherent aviation policy. It cannot make financial sense for a country to protect one or two companies, at the expense of the economic growth of an entire industry. \nTravel and tourism generates economic growth, jobs and investment. Aviation liberalization creates more routes, greater competition and lower fares. We urge the continent’s leaders to fully liberalize aviation for the potential of our industry to be fully realized.” Source: WTTC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:26:42.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
