A large number of French firms, such as Total and Peugeot, are also expected to travel to Iran later this month.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Travel agencies expect a rush of tourists keen to see ancient sites in Iran - such as the mosque at Meydan-e Emam, a Unesco world heritage site in Isfahan.

The Foreign Office in London has also recently lifted its advice against travel to most parts of Iran.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tourists at Tehran rail station, after arriving in the Iranian capital on a luxury train from Budapest.

Tehran itself is famous for having ski resorts on its doorstep.\nMina Mehdinia, organiser of the 2017 convention of the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations – to be held in Tehran – said Iran hopes to attract as many as 20 million tourists per year in 2025. “Iran is trying to establish itself as a new tourist destination in the world and we would like to use this convention to introduce Iran to outsiders as a very safe country to visit. We hope our tourism will receive a significant boost,” she said.\nDespite this, Iran’s tourist sector, service levels and hotels in particular, have not developed significantly since the 1980s, according to Bealby. “Our tourists understand and know that if they’re going to Iran, they know it’s been isolated for 30 years, and therefore they’re not expecting great quality service and wonderful hotels but I think in time hopefully this will start to change.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Ibis and Novotel hotels in Tehran.

Having an embassy there reassures travellers that the British are in place and that we are welcomed.”\nMehdi Jahangiri of Aria Ziggurat expressed hope that the partnership with Accor would upgrade local standards of hotels in the country.\nThere are challenges, however. Iran is still not fully integrated into international systems, and sanctions are still in place, meaning that Iran’s banking sector is cut off from the outside world, meaning western debit and credit cards would not work at ATM machines.", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/007d49c6dd44056df882a1ce07db99f29f1a6678/0_335_5442_3266/master/5442.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=49d1f46c95ed662a83232224f47e1ec2", "http://www.wildfrontierstravel.com/en_GB/", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn%2Fsfb%23img-4&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fd99402ac0ad664318159790148750e0b1d0d706d%2F0_370_5760_3456%2F5760.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/007d49c6dd44056df882a1ce07db99f29f1a6678/0_335_5442_3266/master/5442.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f22e458ee168237633e6b7542224f329", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=French+hotel+chains+open+in+Iran+as+nation+braces+for+wave+of+tourists&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fsep%2F16%2Ffrench-hotel-iran-tourists-ibis-novotel-tehran&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Fd99402ac0ad664318159790148750e0b1d0d706d%2F0_370_5760_3456%2F5760.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99402ac0ad664318159790148750e0b1d0d706d/0_370_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=703a1021cc267643178713ef956226a1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dcf1fafcf2f74530f28bb9b63719ea694785aa7/0_14_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=af6ef17522e3368be00f88bd6a050049", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dcf1fafcf2f74530f28bb9b63719ea694785aa7/0_14_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=1217d73aae7b56af25f374cb901155dc", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F9dcf1fafcf2f74530f28bb9b63719ea694785aa7%2F0_14_5140_3084%2F5140.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/007d49c6dd44056df882a1ce07db99f29f1a6678/0_335_5442_3266/master/5442.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=110b7ce30f925e67d492efe3f9109c71", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=French+hotel+chains+open+in+Iran+as+nation+braces+for+wave+of+tourists&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=French+hotel+chains+open+in+Iran+as+nation+braces+for+wave+of+tourists&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=French+hotel+chains+open+in+Iran+as+nation+braces+for+wave+of+tourists&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn%2Fstw%23img-4", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn%2Fsfb%23img-3&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cdbn&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F007d49c6dd44056df882a1ce07db99f29f1a6678%2F0_335_5442_3266%2F5442.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dcf1fafcf2f74530f28bb9b63719ea694785aa7/0_14_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=11b2b8ac91c4d331e38694bace29c5cc", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=French+hotel+chains+open+in+Iran+as+nation+braces+for+wave+of+tourists&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fsep%2F16%2Ffrench-hotel-iran-tourists-ibis-novotel-tehran&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F9dcf1fafcf2f74530f28bb9b63719ea694785aa7%2F0_14_5140_3084%2F5140.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/007d49c6dd44056df882a1ce07db99f29f1a6678/0_335_5442_3266/master/5442.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=cd4ef23f9ea38ed85750dc86378feced", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99402ac0ad664318159790148750e0b1d0d706d/0_370_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=4221f46ed91e814c24fbd79d07a4f447", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dcf1fafcf2f74530f28bb9b63719ea694785aa7/0_14_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=738719625fdff0ff997426b37c68f6c3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99402ac0ad664318159790148750e0b1d0d706d/0_370_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d2ae82a4ad4aef1404898fc46a7fc316", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d99402ac0ad664318159790148750e0b1d0d706d/0_370_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=43cc775a9d209c7c91e81c5077dcc946", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=French+hotel+chains+open+in+Iran+as+nation+braces+for+wave+of+tourists&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2015%2Fsep%2F16%2Ffrench-hotel-iran-tourists-ibis-novotel-tehran&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F007d49c6dd44056df882a1ce07db99f29f1a6678%2F0_335_5442_3266%2F5442.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-16T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T08:45:53.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
