A third of controllers said they perceived fatigue to be a 'high' or 'extreme' safety risk.\nGreater than six in ten controllers indicated that in the previous year they had fallen asleep or experienced a lapse of attention while driving to or from midnight shifts, which typically begin about 10pm and end around 6am.\nOverall, controllers reported they were averaging 5.8 hours of sleep per day over the course of a work week. They averaged only 3.25 hours before some shifts.\nThe most tiring schedules required controllers to work five straight midnight shifts, or to work six days a week several weeks in a row, often with at least one midnight shift per week. The human body's circadian rhythms make sleeping during daylight hours before a midnight shift especially difficult.\nThe study is composed of a survey of 3,268 controllers about their work schedules and sleep habits, and a field study that monitored the sleep and the mental alertness of more than 200 controllers at 30 air traffic facilities.\nRead more: Asleep on the job: Hong Kong Airport probe launched after security guards caught napping | Hong Kong Free Press", "external_links": ["https://www.hongkongfp.com/2015/08/27/asleep-on-the-job-hong-kong-airport-probe-launched-after-security-guards-caught-napping-on-camera/", "http://dailym.ai/1PCvTGO"], "published": "2015-08-28T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:26:27.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
