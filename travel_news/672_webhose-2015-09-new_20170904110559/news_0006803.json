For my first time volunteering at a festival, I chose to go big before going home. Cue, Burning Man, 2015. \nI was lucky enough to be part of the volunteer crew for the only tour company allowed into the festival, Green Tortoise Adventure Travel . Our camp consisted of around 250 people, a mix of both first time \"burners\" and veterans alike. My role as a volunteer was to do and be whatever was necessary; from packing and loading coolers, to getting crafty with decorations, loading bags as big as myself, acting as a bus ambassador and general cat herding, cooking, doing dishes and collecting MOOP (Material Out Of Place). I also helped put together a few hundred bikes, and dismantle them at the end of the festival.

I discovered a place unlike anywhere else on this earth, and it altered my perspective on what can be achieved when thousands of people are placed in a creative environment where anything feels possible, where people can be whatever they choose. \nAs a first timer, my enthusiasm was at an all time high, but in terms of survival knowledge I think I was ill-equipped. The harsh environment makes many things a battle - attempting to make a meal out in the open in the middle of a dust storm sticks in my mind, and rinsing endless dishes in freezing water once the temperature dropped at night wasn't too appealing either. \nREAD MORE: Ad Feedback \nBikes - the more creative, the better - are the best way to get around Black Rock City. This homemade creation's front wheel is made entirely of shoes. Image: Elicia Milne \nBurning Man, for all of its wonder, is intensely overwhelming for a lot of people, but most especially for first timers. Before we even made it to the desert there was a lost wallet, a lost phone, a lost bag and a misplaced bike. All were found, but the stress of organising so many people for such a huge scale even was profound. \nI learned every issue can, and will be dealt with, and that a positive and reassuring manner always come in handy. After about 10 hours on the road with a bus of 35 people, our buses rolled up to the entrance gate, where we were welcomed by naked \"greeters\". Excitement was at an all time high and people were ready to hit the dust, literally. \nBecause each day is so hard to predict in terms of weather and peoples needs, the challenges never really end, but they did become easier to solve. \nDuring the festival there are dust rashes to contend with, people who become dehydrated and those who don't bring enough clothing and freeze at night. I managed to stay fairly hydrated and dust-rash free (until the final day, at least), but I'll admit to borrowing an extra sleeping bag and an enormous coat to keep warm in the evenings. At the end of the day, despite it all, the beauty outweighed the challenges 100 times over. \nThe focal point of Black Rock City - the Burning Man - was set alight on Saturday night. Image: Elicia Milne \nWhat is Burning Man really about? I was asked this exact question so many times prior to the festival, and while it is incredibly hard to describe when you've never been, it is almost harder to describe once you have. A quick summary of the festival might go like this; Every year, around 70,000 people amass in the Black Rock Desert a few hours out of Reno, Nevada. It is desolate and isolated, a place where there is no running water or power, and definitely no bathrooms. The days are scorching and the nights freezing. The altitude makes the air feel thin and the dust causes everything to smell chalky. \nIn an nutshell, trying to describe Black Rock City is near impossible - it is unique and incomparable to anything else I've ever seen or experienced. \nImagine that you have crash landed on the moon, an enormous dusty plain surrounded by mountain ranges. Now picture a sprawling army of tents and temporary homes set against the mountains, varying from your standard pop up to domes that are sometimes as tall as a tree, and what look like igloos made out of polystyrene. \nEach camp has a name and a theme, and is decorated accordingly. Some camps have dance floors, performance spaces, skate parks and roller derby stages. \nBurning Man is based upon a culture of gift-giving and the generosity was infinite. There are free bars, amazing food on offer, endless hugs - even one from a robot! There are art cars that blast music day, and night, driving around the desert giving people rides and starting dance parties wherever they went. \nThere are massive scale swing bridges that are burnt to the ground at the end of the week. There are 60-ft swings that give you a view of the whole desert, glowing trees lit up at night, like something out of Avatar. \nThe \"The Man\" standing tall in the centre of the desert, and the temple, with memories, emotions and memorials scrawled and hung across the walls. \nI was lucky enough to witness two marriages; one in the middle of a dust storm in the wide open playa by a giant wooden rainbow. The other, a beautiful steam-punk themed ceremony with a lovely Russian couple from my camp. \nDust is a constant companion on the playa. Image: Elicia Milne \nOne of the most heartbreaking and wonderful things of all was coming to terms with the fact that even if I didn't sleep at all, I could never see everything there was to see. Though the festival has been knocked in recent years for becoming more commercialised, I witnessed countless examples of true generosity, self-expression, love and appreciation. \nThe feeling that everybody around me was re-learning how to connect with one another, in a very open and honest way, was overwhelming. By the week's end, \"Happy burn!\" was the standard greeting, and the only way you formally introduced yourself to someone, was with a hug. \nThe sense of community that was embraced by veterans and first timers alike was inspiring. People stop you on your bike to offer you wet wipes after a dust storm, or they pick up a piece of rubbish you have dropped, before you even realise you've dropped it, tucking it into their MOOP bag without a second thought. At the Tortoise Town camp, everyone was included in the day-to-day running of things. \nI saw almost all campers help in some way, whether it was pitching in to help cook for 250 people, helping to burn trash, doing an ice run, loading the buses, or volunteering at the various booths that we ran during the week. \nThere were campers offering hand and body massages for dried out skin and foot baths for cracked dusty feet. People leave no trace in the desert, but they leave their mark on you. I had the pleasure of meeting some amazing campers, some who had been attending Burning Man for two, seven, 10 years, and some first timers like myself. \nIt was great to witness the friendships formed throughout the week, watching people from all over the globe come together and embrace the spirit of the festival, sharing their stories and experiences with each other. I watched the burning of The Man with a group of people who met at our camp; two Americans, two Canadians and a Sri Lankan Australian, most of us strangers at the beginning of the week. \nAt the end of the week, there we were, squeezed onto a mat at the base of The Man. We watched the fireworks, shared sake with a British man to our left, cheered together when The Man was lit and hugged each other when he fell. We had done it. We had survived the desert, the dust, the heat and the cold. \nIt was humanity and human connection at its best: that is what being out in the desert for a week was about. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T10:15:50.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
