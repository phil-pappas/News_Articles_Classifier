This is the 26th year that the hotel will see its new design and will be reopened on the December 11, 2016. The guests are assured of receiving the chills that the hotel has always been offering for many years.\nThe hotel will open in Jukkasjarvi, northern Sweden. The blueprint of the hotel is ready and there will be 5,000 tons of ice taken from the nearby River Torne.\nThis has been happening each year; the ice is taken from the River and stored over the summer and again in spring the ice would melt.\nThe hotel’s creator is very excited about a bumper ice harvest which would give way to 10 cm thick ice blocks. The designs for another 19 suits have also been described.\nThe hotel describes the most unique sculptures. The “Elephant in the Room” suite features a life size African elephant carved from ice. All these carving have been made by a Scandinavian sculptor AnnaSofia Maag.\nAmong the other attractions is a Russian imperial inspired theatre set. It is based on a 1970 theme of “Love capsule”, where guests with their sole mates can cling to each other beneath the reindeer skin. The hotel offers many more attractions for guests to make the most in the sub-zero temperature.\nHigh quality sleeping bags, luxury furs thrown around and many fancifully carved suits with dreamy names can catch the guest’s attention. For those caught in the chill spell there will be rooms to warm up and stay away from the chilling experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T13:19:58.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
