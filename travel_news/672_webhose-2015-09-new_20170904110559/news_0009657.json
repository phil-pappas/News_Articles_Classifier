It is therefore appropriate that our latest Dreamliner sports the name ‘Lickity-Split’!” \nCampbell added, “Scoot’s 787 has allowed us to set a new standard in budget travel, with great new offerings such as Wi-Fi Internet connectivity, streaming entertainment and in-seat power throughout the aircraft, complementing the many choices already enjoyed by our guests. Aside from its great cabin ambiance and improved passenger comfort, the 787’s fantastic operating economics allow us to offer even better value airfares – even more reasons to get outta here!” \nScoot has a firm order of twenty 787s, split equally between 335-seat 787-8’s and 375-seat 787-9’s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:31:44.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
