Taking place on World Tourism Day on Sunday 27 September 2015, the campaign will see over 60 countries and 80 destinations around the world showcase inspiring Instagram images.\nWith Instagram as a primary channel, the #helloworldRELAY provides each state with a platform to showcase the unique attractions and diversity of their region. From wine tasting to whale-watching, vibrant cities to the dusty outback, trail walking to snorkelling, images that make Australia so extraordinary will be shared across the globe during the relay.\nThe State tourism bodies as well as Australia’s leading luxury coach tour operator AAT Kings, will craft bespoke itineraries for renowned instagrammers to experience over 12 hours, from sunrise to sunset featuring scenery, culture, nature, cuisine, wildlife and distinctive qualities of each region. Some of the highlights anticipated from each territory are as follows:\nNew South Wales\nNew South Wales will kick off the Australian mainland leg of the instarelay in Byron Bay at Cape Byron, the country’s most easterly point and the place where day breaks first in Australia. Instagrammers will capture the beauty of this seaside town and the colourful community, which makes it unique.\nSydney will showcase its sparkling Harbour, the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House – three iconic Australian locations and must-see tourism experiences. The city’s appeal will be on show as Instagrammers visit world-famous Bondi Beach and the well-trod Bondi to Bronte coastal walk.\nNew South Wales will also feature its World Heritage-listed paradise, Lord Howe Island, located 660 kilometres east of Port Macquarie in the crystal clear waters of the South Pacific Ocean. The Island promises to provide a spectacular canvas with Instagrammers set to capture the heights of Mount Gower, the beauty of the 48,000 hectares marine park and lush Kentia palm and banyan forests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:16:57.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
