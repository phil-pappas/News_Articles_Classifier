A single page is appropriated from a mass-circulation magazine, placed in direct contact with color photographic paper, and exposed to light. The resulting image superimposes the visual and verbal information from the front (recto) and back (verso) of the magazine page.\nContemporary Glass\nSeptember 12 and ongoing\nThe Kaplan/Ostergaard Glass Center was relocated to the Margaret & Michael W. McCarthy Mezzanine, installed with glass sculptures in fresh new ways under the massive sky light offering a light-filled environment. The center presents a variety of techniques and diverse styles ranging from the narrative and figurative to the exploration of color in space, illustrating how artists use glass as an innovative medium for their individual artistic expressions. The monumental End of the Day #2 by Dale Chihuly is the centerpiece of the space, surrounded by works by other renowned international artists who have had an impact on the development of the contemporary glass movement in major art centers throughout the world. Visitors can view Michael Petry’s epic Golden Rain installation, study the casting process by Ivana Šrámkova, and marvel how Lino Tagliapietra and Marvin Lipofsky apply detailed hand-carved techniques to their blown glass forms. Nicole Chesney merges formal investigations of color, space, and light while Daniel Clayman explores physical properties of light effecting surface and volume, and Therman Statom unites experimental combinations of glass, painting, and mixed media in an exuberant assemblage.\nReflections on Water\nSeptember 19 and ongoing\nPresented in the Denney Western American Art Wing, the gallery presents numerous contexts that find a shared nexus through the multiple uses of water. While water is one of the most visible signs of the negative impact that human progress has created on the environment, it is equally the source of pleasure and play, natural wonder, and cultural symbolism. Visitors are invited to make personal connections and consider how their experiences with water link them to a complex network of ideas, values and emotions, while also considering water as substance and symbolism.\nKiller Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe\nNow through December 13, 2015\nOrganized by the Brooklyn Museum, this exhibition is organized thematically, showcasing more than 110 contemporary high heels and 50 historical designs drawn from designer archives.

Among the well-known works on view are multiple sculptures by Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore, Jacques Lipchitz, and Marino Marini, and individual masterworks by Amedeo Modigliani, Jean Arp, and Isamu Noguchi.

Throughout time, visual artists have delighted in the excitement of transforming commonplace objects into symbolic encounters with the world and self. Bringing together paintings, sculptures, photographs, and a surprising variety of other media, this exhibition studies the powerful psychological and associational value of altering time, place, and imagery into an artistic still life.\nFree Friday Film Screenings:\nEvery Friday ART21 brings a new film to audiences. Over the past decade, ART21 has established itself as the preeminent chronicler of contemporary art and artists through its Peabody Award-winning, PBS-broadcast television series, ART21 Art in the Twenty-First Century. The nonprofit organization has used the power of digital media to introduce millions of people of all ages to contemporary art and artists and has created a new paradigm for teaching and learning about the creative process.\nThe Architecture and Design Center, Edwards Harris Pavilion\nSeeing the Light: Illuminating Objects\nOctober 10 through January 3, 2016\nDiverse objects selected from the museum’s permanent collection and from private collections demonstrate the boundless fascination of the expressive power of light: reflection, illumination, glow, radiance, shimmer, shine, and luster. For designers and artists the luminosity of materials is endlessly fascinating. Using examples from midcentury to contemporary designers and artists, the installation examines how the chosen materials and media reflect light or illuminate. Artworks include Frank Gehry’s Fish Lamp glowing from within, Beatrice Wood’s pottery with lustrous surfaces, and Sebastian Errazuriz’s shiny stainless steel of Chaise reminiscent of a mirror. Other intriguing works illustrating the drama of radiance include an out-sized globe designed by Robert Wilson for a stage production of Einstein on the Beach and the striking fabric, Magnum, designed by Jack Lenor Larsen for a theater curtain.
