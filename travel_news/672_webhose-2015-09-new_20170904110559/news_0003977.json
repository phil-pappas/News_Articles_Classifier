Both mother and baby are at risk if mum gains too much weight while pregnant. Picture: Thinkstock. Source: ThinkStock\nOther research has found the diet of both mother and baby in the first three years of life can set food and taste preferences and determine the risk of obesity.\nMore than 50 per cent of pregnant women gain more weight than that the recommended 11-16 kilograms, particularly those who are already overweight or obese, says UNSW researcher Professor O’Sullivan .\nAnd he says advice that pregnant women need to raise energy intake needs to be reassessed.\n“These findings suggest the need for reassessment of nutritional advice given to pregnant women, as current advice to increase energy intake may be increasing the risk of excessive gestational weight gain,” he said.\nThe study published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology followed 26 women throughout their pregnancy and monitored their diet and weight gain.\nSixteen normal weight, five overweight and five obese women took part and were studied at three time points: 12-14 weeks, 24-26 weeks and 34-36 weeks of gestation.\nKeeping track ... Women in the study had to record a three day food diary several times. Picture: Thinkstock. Source: ThinkStock\nThe women provided a diary of what they ate over a three-day period in the first, second and third trimester of their pregnancy.\nSydney’s St George Hospital used mobile sensor technology to track the women’s weight gain, energy spent and food intake.\nIt found their calorie intake remained steady throughout the pregnancy at around 2066, or 8649 kilojoules.\nOn average, the women gained 10.8 kilograms during pregnancy, seven kilograms of which was additional fat mass, largely put on between the first and second trimester.\nThis laying down of fat stores occurred despite an almost 8 per cent surge in daily energy demand and no significant change in food intake, the study says.\nInterestingly, the study found body fat percentage change was significantly higher for women of normal BMI compared with women who were overweight or obese.\nKeeping a buffer ... Normal weight women put down more fat stores than overweight women during pregnancy. Picture Thinkstock. Source: ThinkStock\nFat stores are essential in pregnancy to buffer fluctuations in energy supply and demand driven by the growing foetus, as well as the significant energy demands of breastfeeding, particularly in the first six weeks following birth, says Professor O’Sullivan.\nOther research has found mice fed gut bacteria from women in their third-trimester of pregnancy put on more fat than mice fed first-trimester gut bacteria, despite both groups eating the exact same diet and exercising the same amount.\n“Stool studies from women in the late stages of pregnancy also show evidence of reduced energy loss,” Professor O’Sullivan said.\n“Pregnancy-related changes in gut microbiota could potentially allow pregnant women to absorb more calories from their diet for fat storage without changing the caloric or macronutrient intake, he said.\n The diet mums-to-be need to stop", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/pregnancy-is-no-longer-an-excuse-to-eat-for-two-unsw-study-finds-mums-and-babies-are-at-risk/story-fnet08ck-1227542560218", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/09/24/1227542/560191-749cf69a-626e-11e5-80d4-bfa4602ce970.jpg", "https://med.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-tony-osullivan", "http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/one-in-two-pregnant-woman-are-overweight/story-fnet08ck-1226770839257", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/24/1227542/558734-6ecdf462-626e-11e5-80d4-bfa4602ce970.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/09/24/1227542/560162-7c9317b2-626e-11e5-80d4-bfa4602ce970.jpg", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1479-828X", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/babies-learn-bad-food-habits/story-fnk1w5xv-1226770259956"], "published": "2015-09-25T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T23:31:16.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
