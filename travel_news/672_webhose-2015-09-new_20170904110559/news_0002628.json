In fact, you won’t even have to step outside.\nThe North York Moors and the 109-mile stretch of Cleveland Way are currently being mapped with Google Street View cameras thanks to a team of trekking volunteers.\nThe team, led by Jonathan Steele, is taking it in turns to wear a backpack with a mapping camera loaned to them by Google. The route will stretch from Helmsley, across the Moors and on to Saltburn, before looping back through the National Park to the picturesque Filey coastline.\n Filey, on the Yorkshire coast – soon to be seen on Google Street View. Photograph: Alamy\nMalcolm Hodgson, the National Trails Officer told GazetteLive that: “There are numerous spectacular and beautiful locations along the Cleveland Way and the Trekker allows us to showcase them to the world in the same way that people use Google Street View.”\nTo celebrate Teesside being put on the map – literally – we take a look at seven other locations and experiences tapped by Google Street View.\n1. Walking with elephants, Kenya’s Samburu Park\nTeaming up with charity Save the Elephant, Google offers the chance to roam with the animals in Samburu National Reserve, Kenya. Google’s camera-loaded cars mapped the area back in February 2015, driving along a 165km road. Elephants, zebras and leopards can all be spotted during the virtual journey.\n“We hope that by bringing Street View to Samburu, we will inspire people around the world to gain a deeper appreciation for elephants,” Google Kenya’s Farzana Khubchandani said . Think that elephants are all the same? Pff. David Daballen, head of operations at Save the Elephant, wrote that he recognised more than 600 of the elephants on Google’s Street View.\n2. Climbing El Capitan, Yosemite Before Yosemite was an Apple operating system , it was a stunning Californian national park (no, really, kids!) And since June 2015, thanks to Google , it’s been explorable from the comfort of one’s home. What’s more, users can experience what it is like to climb the 3,000 feet of El Capitan mountain, thanks to cameras that tracked Lynn Hill, Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell during their 19 day exertion.\n3. Strolling through Marseille by night Possibly the most romantic projec t Google has ever undertaken, the Night Walk in Marseille was made in collaboration with advertising agency 72andsunny and digital producers Media Monk .\nNarrated by the artist “Christoph”, users explore a district of the city described as the “heart of the urban savannah”. Embedded videos tell stories of how street art was produced, as traffic noise hums in the background.\n4. Liwa desert, by camel\nEver wanted to be a camel? Who hasn ’t wanted to be a camel? Thanks to Raffia, the 10-year-old camel who carried a camera across the Liwa Desert, United Arab Emirates, in 2014, you can experience just that. Because of Raffia, viewers can go on a trip through Liwa’s rolling dunes, oasis and scuttling sands.\nTwo other locations in UAE are available in fully glory on Google Street View: the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.\n5. Inside Nasa Ground control to Major Tom – it’s now possible to visit Nasa without even scraping a C in physics. The Google Street View team has mapped many parts of the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, including the top of launch pad 39A and three different firing rooms.\nWhen the collaboration launched in 2012, Lisa Malone, director of the centre’s public affairs, said Google now offered “a behind-the-scenes look at the Kennedy Space Center’s unique facilities that launched humans to the moon and space shuttles to low Earth orbit.” Which is a lot of bragging in one sentence, if you ask me.\nThe Kennedy Space Center, which opened its doors to Google in 2012. Photograph: Google 6. On the water in Venice Venice: it’s the scene of many a grand romance – and some that are slightly morally dubious (cough, Thomas Mann, cough). As of November 2013, it is also one of the locations for Google’s treks. Explore the archipelago by its canals, cross its famous Bridge of Sighs and visit Piazza San Marco. You might not be able to bring back a Venetian mask souvenir, but at least you won’t have to pay €20 for an ice-cream.\n7. Swimming with seals, Galápagos Islands Fancy hanging out with seals, sea lions and giant tortoises? Well Google has you covered, because back in 2013 the team trekked to the Galápagos Islands in conjunction with the Charles Darwin Foundation, and covered the animal populations found there. Google returned for 10 days late last year to revisit its giant tortoise conservation program.\n“We’re hoping that, by bringing Street View there, people will be able to appreciate the efforts that are going on to preserve the islands for the future,” said Raleigh Seamster, project leader of Google Earth Outreach.\n“These are places you can’t drive to, can’t visit, and we’re bringing them across the world.”\nYou can find more of Google Street View treks here , including explorations of Angkor Wat and the pyramids of Giza, as well as the Grand Canyon and the Amazon basin.", "external_links": ["http://www.72andsunny.com/", "http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/roseberry-topping-google-street-view-10077211", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Seven+wonders+of+the+world+to+explore+on+Google+Street+View&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2015%2Fsep%2F18%2Fseven-wonders-of-the-world-google-street-view&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F18%2F1442580622750%2F7d611d39-608a-49aa-95ea-abe939bc0cb3-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://www.google.com/maps/views/streetview/sheikh-zayed-grand-mosque?gl=us", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/18/1442575418020/187574ee-a668-47d7-a2f0-7950d048b178-620x372.png?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=80cf4032604038f631b2167be4461cfa", "https://www.google.com/maps/streetview/", "http://www.galapagos.org/newsroom/google-returns-to-galapagos/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?wmode=opaque&list=PLcRbp4LqBpwEkq3N2P9znDmL_MBvaPe1F", "https://nightwalk.withgoogle.com/en/home", "http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2014-10/9/1/enhanced/webdr08/anigif_enhanced-5077-1412831598-26.gif&quot;", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/18/1442580622750/7d611d39-608a-49aa-95ea-abe939bc0cb3-2060x1236.jpeg?w=140&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=483c06d375a0ba015868ff9ec7739989", "https://www.google.com/maps/streetview/#samburu-kenya", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/18/1442580622750/7d611d39-608a-49aa-95ea-abe939bc0cb3-2060x1236.jpeg?w=120&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d812dff87eb79f6211744659bd0f2df9", "https://www.google.com/maps/@37.7290135,-119.636547,3a,75y,212.45h,29t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sCg1Rcf8h2wIAAAQqZe0GeQ!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656", "https://www.google.co.uk/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/burj-khalifa/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/18/1442580622750/7d611d39-608a-49aa-95ea-abe939bc0cb3-2060x1236.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=c3baf3d8145c605ffb1e5699e6fb0ba4", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Seven+wonders+of+the+world+to+explore+on+Google+Street+View&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cg6e%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cg6e%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cg6e&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F18%2F1442580622750%2F7d611d39-608a-49aa-95ea-abe939bc0cb3-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://google-latlong.blogspot.co.uk/2015/09/walk-alongside-elephants-of-samburu.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZUWdDYWBxc", "http://b.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/11/3021709-poster-960-venice.gif&quot;", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pVCToDTbT4?start=28&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=28", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pVCToDTbT4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/18/1442575418020/187574ee-a668-47d7-a2f0-7950d048b178-620x372.png?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=6f5977179fae5e3a13fedfedc08ec7e8", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34256893", "http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2014-04/enhanced/webdr08/6/8/anigif_enhanced-29687-1396788278-9.gif&quot;", "http://www.mediamonks.com/work", "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VsH0MQVzldo/VYo3m9bkxWI/AAAAAAAAQkQ/b7526HKN4aI/s1600/09_El-Cap-Tower-Morning_GIF_v3_3mb.gif&quot;", "https://www.google.co.uk/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/venice/", "http://www.outsideonline.com/2013196/google-street-views-majestic-tortoise-tour", "http://www.google.com/maps/streetview/#nasa/apollosaturn-v-center", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/18/1442575418020/187574ee-a668-47d7-a2f0-7950d048b178-620x372.png?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=8eb3bcee206868511fb672274ac21418", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/18/1442575418020/187574ee-a668-47d7-a2f0-7950d048b178-620x372.png?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=cd962cdc6769d9e8d55827b190d5311c"], "published": "2015-09-18T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:29:27.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
