The firefighters put on the street show wearing their full gear for the opening of an exhibit at the museum commemorating the 150th anniversary of the firefighting service in Costa Rica.\nThe exhibit, which includes a simulation game where guests can put out a fire, and historical artifacts from the trade, costs ₡2,700 (roughly $5) to enter and runs from Wednesday, Sept. 2 through the end of October.\nThe firefighters’ show Wednesday was actually an encore performance of a previous dance they performed on July 26 at their official anniversary ceremony in San José’s Plaza de la Cultura.\nContact Zach Dyer at zdyer@ticotimes.net", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMnk7lh9M3o"], "published": "2015-09-03T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:21:32.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
