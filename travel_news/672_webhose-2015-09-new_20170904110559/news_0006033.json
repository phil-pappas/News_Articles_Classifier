What is happening tonight needs to be encouraged, because this is the only way for Seychelles to save its rich cultural identity. You are giving to the Seychellois public the music that they love to listen to, and this in all its diversity. The Ministry of Tourism and Culture and its National Arts Council will continue to stand with you, members of the music fraternity,\" said Minister Alain St.Ange, who was accompanied on stage by Benjamine Rose, his PS for Culture, and Jimmy Savy, the CEO of the National Arts Council. \nThe Minister responsible for Culture also had words of thanks for the public who continue to come out to support such musical shows and performances. \"It is because of your continued support that such musical shows continue to take place and that our performing artists continue to perform. Your support is really appreciated,\" Minister St.Ange said. \nThe Minister also spoke about the need for everyone to continue to work together to keep the culture of its people alive. \"When we speak about our culture, we are speaking about our people, because without our people we have no culture. This is why we are creating a music stadium right in the heart of Victoria, because we are committed to ensure that our culture remains alive and our performing artists continue to make their living from the gift that they were blessed with, that gift of creating the music we all love dearly,\" Minister Alain St.Ange said. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
