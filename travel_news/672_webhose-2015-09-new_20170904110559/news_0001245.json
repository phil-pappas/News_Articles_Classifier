We just don’t have enough airline capacity, we don’t have enough transportation capacity, we certainly don’t have enough hotel capacity,” Mr Bekier told an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in Sydney.\nEcho is focused on the hotel part of the equation, having recently won the right to build a new five-hotel casino resort in Brisbane. But Mr Bekier says more needs to be done to catch the wave of cashed-up Chinese travellers now looking beyond Hong Kong and Macau for their next holiday.\nThere are between two and four million millionaires in China now, Mr Bekier estimates, and their taste is for business class flights and five-star hotels when they take a holiday.\n“We are now at the cusp of the wave hitting Australia and other markets,” Mr Bekier said.\n“What excites us is this isn’t just a wave. This is a rising sea level because behind the first wave of tourists that are now coming there’s millions more.”\nMr Bekier said Australia was taking too long to simplify entry requirements for Chinese tourists while competing holiday destinations were aggressively chasing market share.\n“I think I called it an arms race: around the world right now there’s about $1.3 trillion of tourism infrastructure being developed,” he said.\nEcho is focusing on the next wave of “mass-affluent” punters who follow in the wake of high-roller pioneers.\nMr Bekier said China would be the key market for the next 30 years but also that China was “shorthand” for the broader Asian region, which will also generate wealthy tourists as more people move into the middle class.\nHe also said competition with James Packer’s new high-end casino at Barangaroo would be a positive for Sydney when the $2 billion facility opens in 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:09:03.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
