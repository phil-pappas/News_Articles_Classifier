After registering for Lounger you build a profile though your Facebook account and choose the images you want to display. The app then allows you to pick which airport lounge you are in before checking out who else is using the service. \n&amp;nbsp; \n* Is is possible to pick someone up on a plane? \nCo-founder Nilsson told The Huffington Post the idea of Lounger came from noticing their are a lot of lonely people in airport lounges around the world. \"I'm always glancing at the people approaching the lounge trying to pick up the courage to speak to someone about being their plus-one without causing an awkward scene.\" Nilsson said. \n\"Flying is a pretty lonely business and transiting tends to be boring. We want to make it exciting. We're encouraging fellow travellers to be kind to strangers, socialise more, and why not use the app for dating?\" \nWould you use the Lounger app?
