China Daily talked with three members of the People’s Liberation Army who have taken part in peacekeeping missions in Africa and the Middle East about their experiences. Engineer learns value of peace Only after Lt Col Shi Shaobo witnessed first-hand the trauma of people living in war-torn countries did he fully grasp the value of peace. The engineer is one of the People’s Liberation Army Beijing Military Area Command’s most experienced peacekeepers, having led his team on five tours of Liberia in west Africa between 2006 and 2012. “Liberia is extremely underdeveloped, and most of its villages still do not have access to electricity,” said the 41-yearold, who said he sympathised with the people’s plight and was determined to help. And he did. After spending a total of 40 months in the country, he has helped construct more than 745 miles of road, greater than the distance between Beijing and Shanghai. Lt Col Shi Shaobo says goodbye to his wife and daughter before he departs for his fifth mission to Liberia Photo: Provided to China Daily Lt Col Shi believed the violence that has plagued Liberia has been fueled by a lack of development and in the end, he said, it was innocent people who had suffered the most. During his five missions he has led a 50-member engineering regiment with dozens of vehicles, including excavators and bulldozers, to build roads, bridges and maintain the infrastructure of the country’s airports. This was not without its risks, however. “Because of the continuing tribal conflicts, peacekeeping forces f rom Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan had to protect us while we were doing our jobs,” he explained. The engineer said militiamen armed with machetes would occasionally intercept his unit’s supply fleet and demanded food and other supplies, while personnel also had to be prepared for, and stay alert to, random acts of violence. “The experience made me realise that stability is the precondition for social development and only a strong army can protect a country’s stability,” he said. Communication is also vital in establishing trust and a rapport with the people in countries receiving peacekeeping aid. “When we first arrived in Liberia, few of us could communicate with the local people because most of us could not speak English. However, we later figured out that people can communicate by means other than language,” such as a simple hand gesture or facial expression, Lt Col Shi said. “What makes me really proud is that, often, Liberians would come up to us and give us a thumbs up and say ‘China good’.” Chinese soldiers show skills to world Bomb disposal specialist Lt Col Peng Shoucong and his team have risked their lives many times to protect the people of Lebanon, as well as prove the abilities of China’s peacekeepers. He is now partway through his fifth tour of the Middle Eastern country and said he is proud to be able to show the world the skills and quality of Chinese engineers. “I was fortunate to be one of the first Chinese soldiers dispatched to Lebanon after its 2006 war with Israel,” Lt Col Peng said in a telephone interview. His 64-member team, of which he is second in command, was among the first peacekeeping forces sent by 30 countries, many of them from Europe. It is now part of the 14th Chinese peacekeeping force to the country. Lt Col Peng Shoucong (front left), a bomb disposal specialist, works with his team members in Lebanon Photo: Provided to China Daily “When we first got here, I think other countries did not take us as seriously as they should have,” he recalled but the situation in Lebanon meant there were plenty of opportunities to quickly prove themselves and earn not just the respect of soldiers from other contingents, but also the gratitude of the local people. “I remember very clearly in 2006 when an unexploded bomb buried itself into the forecourt of a gas station,” he said. Bomb disposal experts from Spain, France, and Italy were all dispatched to the scene, but it was a difficult task. “We were asked to help,” he said, and at that moment he understood the severity of the challenge: The 2,000 lb bomb had pierced the ground and was lodged almost 50 ft below the surface. Any mistake — a slip of a finger, cutting the wrong wire — would be fatal, but Lt Col Peng said he managed to disarm it and make the area safe. “You could tell almost immediately how our reputation had grown, and others realised we could do the job as well if not better than some others,” he added. Over the years, local residents and foreign peacekeeping forces have recognised the ability of the Chinese soldiers to handle dangerous situations, he said, which has given him and his team a sense of pride and immense satisfaction. “Not to brag on behalf of my men or myself, but when you realise that after nearly 10 years of being involved in peacekeeping missions in Lebanon we have not suffered any casualties, it shows that we know what we’re doing,’’ Lt Col Peng said. Just married and ready for action Gu Shan got to enjoy only a few weeks of wedded bliss before she was shipped off to join China’s peacekeeping force in Liberia for eight months — but she had no regrets. The 29-year-old, a captain with the People’s Liberation Army Beijing Military Area Command, was married on Sept 29, 2012, and then deployed on Nov 13 with her unit as part of the country’s 14th peacekeeping force to Liberia. “My parents and new husband did not want me to go but I insisted and went to Liberia anyway,” she said. Capt Gu, a liaison officer with a 43-member medical team, was one of 13 female military officers who volunteered to take part in the mission. “I studied English in school but had not had many chances to use it,” she said. “So peacekeeping missions were attractive to me because they provided a chance to go abroad and practice my skills.” Captain Gu Shan, a liaison officer with a medical team, says conditions were challenging during her eight months in Liberia Photo: Provided to China Daily Based in Zwedru, one of the biggest cities in Liberia, her team provided treatment for UN staff and local residents, conducted training programs in medical schools, and taught first aid to police officers. “The overall situation in Liberia was stable when I was there and the biggest challenges were in ensuring food supplies, tackling contagious diseases and poor accommodation.” As Liberia sits on the west coast of Africa, heavy rain and poor road conditions made it extremely difficult for UN troops to deliver supplies, especially food. “UN teams sent us supplies once a month but when we first arrived we had to ration our food for a month due to the bad weather, which made the transport links unusable. “Fresh fruit and vegetables were rare in the rainy seasons so we planted vegetables in our yards,” Capt Gu said. “We all lived in makeshift houses and I remember a strong wind nearly blew down one of the walls of our room once.” She added that her team kept fit and healthy by doing physical exercise in the evenings. Capt Gu returned to China with her unit shortly before the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2013. According to the Ministry of National Defense, a team of 257 soldiers left Beijing for Liberia on Sept 7 as part of the 18th deployment of Chinese peacekeepers to the country since 2003.
