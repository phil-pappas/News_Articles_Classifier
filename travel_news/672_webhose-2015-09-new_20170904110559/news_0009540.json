It now has the potential to attract 70,000 visitors to East Antrim.The dramatic two-mile long path, part of Northern Ireland's famous Causeway Coastal Route, consists of a network of walkways, bridges and water-splashed gantries embedded into the black basalt sheer cliff faces.Just a 40 minute drive from Belfast, The Gobbins coastal path lies at the beginning of the world-famous Causeway Coastal Route and is situated close to the famous Blackhead lighthouse. This geologically diverse Northern Ireland landscape also provides the location backdrop for the hit TV series, Game of Thrones.During its Edwardian heyday, The Gobbins attracted more tourists than The Giant's Causeway but five decades after launching it fell into disrepair and closed to the public in 1954.The magnificently restored attraction is set to become a thriving tourism hub once again. The Gobbins - which takes its name from the Irish 'An Gobain', meaning 'the points of rock' - features a series of both tubular and suspension bridges, replicating the design marvel created by Wise over 100 years ago.The pathway offers an exhilarating walk to awaken the senses, a mix of rugged beauty, spectacular views, heritage, flora and fauna. Nature lovers can get up close and personal with coastal birds such as guillemots and kittiwakes, as well as Northern Ireland's only mainland colony of puffins.Vanessa Markey of Tourism Ireland said: \" The re-opening of The Gobbins marks a huge milestone for tourism in Northern Ireland and we look forward to welcoming even more visitors to this unique attraction.\"With access by guided tour, The Gobbins journey begins at a new state-of-the-art visitor centre, which includes a café and interactive exhibition. Following a safety briefing, walkers are transferred to the cliff path by minibus. Tours begin on the hour, currently from 10am to 3pm daily. The full excursion including the visitor centre can take up to 3-4 hours.Other popular destinations within the region include The Giant's Causeway, the Glens of Antrim, Bushmills Distillery, Rathlin Island as well as miles of golden sand.Further info: http://www.thegobbinscliffpath.com Valere Tjolle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T04:28:43.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
