Too bad, Alberta hasn't been doing a great job lately of telling the world. \nCase in point... well, here are five cases in point where Alberta has failed at promoting itself. \n1. There are a number of things to do in Okotoks Cancelling my Tuscan vacation. Headed to Okotoks for a very vague good time. pic.twitter.com/ujg6FHYd4n \n— Omar Mouallem (@omar_aok) September 23, 2015 \nThe Town of Okotoks wins at failing with their exceptionally bland slogan. \nOfficials intially protested that the photo above missed the full slogan — which began with \"Let your summer unfold in Okotoks.\" But the town soon realized they might as well run with it. What a funny meme! Share ur fun slogans to win a gift basket with 'things to do in #Okotoks '! #thingstodoinokotoks pic.twitter.com/n3iRjSu3Va \n— Town of Okotoks (@townofokotoks) September 24, 2015 \nDear person who wins this gift basket full of \"things to do in Okotoks,\" let us know what they are, k? \n2. Edmonton: Home of garbage and gas stations \nReality show \"Amazing Race Canada\" swung by Edmonton for the 11th leg of this season's race. Locations usually try to capitalize on the huge TV audience by show off their best attractions. Teams stop at places like the Humayun's Tomb in Delhi, or are challenged to tango dance in Buenos Aires. \nIn Edmonton, teams were asked to ... sort recycling at the glamorous Edmonton Waste Management Centre, and shop for snacks at the exotic Petro-Canada gas station in St. Albert. \nBet you couldn't sleep thinking about visiting the Edmonton Waste Management Centre. \nOMG, it's the Petro-Can! \nBut wait, there's MORE. \nEdmonton showed its best hospitality to contestants as all but one of the cab drivers who were asked to wait took off, stranding the teams. \nTo be fair, the city's Waste Management Centre has one defender on Reddit : Comment from discussion Anyone watch the last Amazing Race Canada? . \n3. Alberta... or Northumberland? \nAlberta is a land-locked province. But that didn't stop the provincial government from trying to pass off the North Sea coastline in the U.K. as Alberta. In 2009, two tourism ads showed the image of children running on the \"Alberta\" beach. \n\"Children are a symbol of the future. They symbolize that Albertans are a worldly people ,\" a provincial overnment spokesperson told the Telegraph. \n4. Come to Calgary, enjoy our illegal activities \nCalgary Economic Development's “ Right Here – Calgary Destination Video \" promotes a number of fun things to do in Calgary, including, in the ad's first seven seconds, slacklining. Unfortunately, slacklining carries a fine of between $100 and $1,000 under Calgary's tree protection bylaws. \nThe video also features skateboarders on Stephen Avenue, where, at the time of filming, it was illegal to skateboard. \n5. Alberta forgets Nunavut exists \nErm, we seem to be missing a territory. \nAlberta might be bad at marketing itself, but it might be even worse at promoting the rest of Canada. \nIn this ad from Travel Alberta, the map designer forgot to include Nunavut — making it about 16 years behind the times. \nThe map also shows an adrift Cape Breton Island, and a missing Ellesmere Island. \nBut perhaps Alberta doesn't need any kind of marketing campaign. It speaks for itself. Wild Alberta: Have You Been To These Odd Spots? of   Yes, there are Trekkies everywhere. You can even find them in great numbers in comic and sci-fi convetions all over the world. But what if a whole town got in the act? That's exactly what happened in Vulcan, a small town that's embraced its inner geek in galactic proportions. And it works so well even Leonard Nimoy showed up and saw first hand the scores of Star Trek fans who make the pilgrimage to the tiny town each year, the massive Starship Enterprise that greets visitors to the hamlet and the Vulcan Tourism Trek Station, ahem, tourist centre, where you can grab Spock ears. WATCH Leonard Nimoy's visit to Vulcan and Vulcanites doing what they do best. (Wikipedia) Second World War POW camps are still to this day a solemn subject and many Albertans find it odd that there were several of the camps right in their backyards. Camps were located throughout the province, including Lethbridge, Medicine Hat and Seebe, in Kananaskis Country, as seen here. (Appaloosa, Flickr.com) Yes, Drumheller is home to the Royal Tyrell Museum. The royal designation is a well-deserved one for the world-leading and renowned archeological facility. But what if you are looking for a more primal experience? What if you want to drive along the hoodoos, which look like they were pulled from The Land Before Time and that usher visitors to the town, and just want to have a rediculously primordial experience. Drumheller can provide that too, with the world's biggest dinosaur. This particular dinosaur is not a living beast, nor was it ever, but it is huge. And, for a couple of bucks, you can climb inside and take in the panoramic view of the town and the badlands beyond. Now, that's odd. (Joe_tourist, Flickr.com) It's a solemn site but to stand before the rock slide that crushed the old town of Frank nearly 110 years ago is to be overwhelmed by scale. There really is no other place like it in Alberta. The town, and most of its occupants, remain buried by the millions of tons of gigantic rocks that wiped it from the face of the Earth in 1903. It is Canada's deadliest rock slide and if nothing else it is solemnly unique. (Gord McKenna, Flickr) There's odd and then there's look-at-that-gopher-dressed-like-Mozart-next-to-a-firetruck odd. That's what awaits the daring visitors to the Gopher Hole Museum in Torrington. If you've ever wondered what a gopher would look like if he had chosen to live life as a man of the cloth, as a farmer, or a Mountie, there is a stuffed gopher at the museum who can put your curiosity to rest. For being about such small critters, the Gopher Hole Museum is one big oddity. (Cogdog, Flickr.com) It's enough to make someone feel erratic. The massive rock just outside Okotoks is believed to weigh more than 15,000 tonnes, which is why it is also comnonly known as Big Rock. Sound familiar? That's where the popular brewery gets its name. What makes this rock worth visiting - even if you're not a Trad drinker - is that it's the biggest of countless of other erratic rocks that were deposited along the foothills by massive glaciers thousands of years ago but that originated in Jasper National Park. That's a pretty long way for such a big rock to go. (Wikipedia) Not only is this an extremely odd geomorphological formation, the way in which it was discovered is also odd. The Badlands Guardian, located near Medicine Hat, is a feature that from the air bares a striking resemblance to a human head wearing a traditional Native headdress and iPod ear buds. And if that wasn't odd enough, the feature - a natural drainage with a road leading to an oil well located where an ear would be - was found by Lynn Hickox while browsing Google Earth images in 2006. Top that for odd! (Google Earth) So Toronto, the biggest city in Canada, has an iconic tower with a restaurant on top. Calgary, Alberta's biggest city, has an iconic tower with a restaurant on top. So, why not Lethbridge? The southern Alberta city also has a tower - formerly the town's water tower - and it too has a restaurant on top. Eye-sore or iconic? You tell us in the comments. (Youtube) The aggressive name of this UNESCO world heritage site doesn't leave much to the imagination. The buffalo jump was used for 5,500 years by the Blackfoot people before horses were common. They drove the buffaloes off the cliff and used their carcasses to make homes, weapons and clothing. Now, the site has an interactive museum and is in the foothills of the rocky mountains. Do you believe in extra terrestrials? St. Paul does. They created the first UFO landing pad in order to bring in tourists and aliens. Best of both worlds? The landing pad was opened in 1967 and if you didn't think things could be weirder, the sign says, \"The area under the World's First UFO Landing Pad was designated international by the Town of St. Paul as a symbol of our faith that mankind will maintain the outer universe free from national wars and strife. That future travel in space will be safe for all intergalactic beings, all visitors from earth or otherwise are welcome to this territory and to the Town of St. Paul.\" This is a place the family is sure to enjoy. The world's largest roadside beaver makes his home in Beaverlodge, Alta. It took 18 blocks of foam, 13 gallons of paint and 90 gallons of polyurethane to cover and weighs more than 1,500 pounds. You'll have to drive a long way to get a piece of this beaver, however -- this buck-toothed Canadian icon rests on the side of the highway in northwestern Alberta on the way to the Alaska Highway. Is it worth the drive to Beaverlodge? We'll let you decide.  Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T05:14:57.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
