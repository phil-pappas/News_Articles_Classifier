There are times when passengers complain that it’s difficult to get flights to the city,” said Maria Jamella Cas, sales officer for Rajah Tours Middle East, India and Sri Lanka. “It’s even better that UAE carriers are also required to fly direct to Clark and Cebu so that travellers no longer need to spend a night in Manila.” \n\nTeody Espallardo, senior sales manager of Huma Island Resort & Spa, also welcomed the new ASA as it will bolster the efforts of the Philippine Department of Tourism to develop the inbound market from the Middle East for the past seven years. \n\nThe availability of more comfortable flight options will likely appeal to the Arab travellers, as PAL and CEB offer only economy class targeted at OFWs to the UAE, commented a travel consultant who requested anonymity. \n\nPAL found the agreement unfair however, with the national carrier issuing a strongly worded statement objecting to the “unnecessary” flight entitlements requested by the UAE as it might hurt its operations on the highly lucrative Manila-Dubai route. \n\nBut Carmelo Arcilla, executive director of the Philippines’ Civil Aeronautics Board, who was also part of the negotiating panel, told TTG Asia e-Daily that “the Philippine panel and our carriers view the agreement as more or less fair, as the increase in traffic rights for both sides are minimal” and “would serve also the interest of national connectivity”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T10:29:03.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
