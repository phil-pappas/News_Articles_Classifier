Three small plane crashes took place this Labor Day weekend leaving 10 people dead from North Carolina to Oregon.\nNo one knows as to how the crashes took place. The crash of a Cessna 310 that nosed down in a remote part of Colorado near Telluride was the most heart wreaking. All five people in the plane died. The Colorado guards are still searching the mystery behind the crashes.\nOn Monday a Beechcraft A36 crashed near a rock quarry about 6 miles from its intended destination in Greensboro, North Carolina. Three people were killed in that crash. The plane’s pilot apparently got disoriented in trying to find his way to the Greensboro’s airport. The controllers tried to direct the pilot to the airport but unfortunately failed.\nThe third plane crash occurred 2000 miles away in Oregon, near an airport Lake. The two seated plane crashed around 10 a.m.(1 p.m. ET) near an airport field in Creswell, about 12 miles south of Eugene. The plane was already on fire when the authorities arrived. There were two people inside a 35-year-old pilot and his 83-year-old passenger died in the crash.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:07:16.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
