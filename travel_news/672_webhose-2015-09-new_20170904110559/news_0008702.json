(AP) â€” Attorneys were questioning a second pool of jurors in the federal court trial of a Pennsylvania Catholic priest charged with traveling to Honduras to have sex with poor street children during missionary trips.\nTwenty-five jurors from a pool of 70 questioned Tuesday were asked to return for final jury selection on Thursday. Another pool of 70 jurors was being questioned Wednesday, and some of them will also return Thursday.\nThe Rev. Joseph Maurizio Jr., has been jailed since last fall.\nFederal prosecutors in Johnstown say the 70-year-old Somerset County priest molested three boys and illegally sent $8,000 to a charity to help facilitate the trips which ended in 2009.\nThe priest has denied wrongdoing and is supported by some members of Our Lady Queen of Angels, the church he's on leave from because of the charges.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:28:27.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
