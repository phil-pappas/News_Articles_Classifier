Located less than a mile from the Texas A&M University campus, Aloft College Station is the eighth Aloft hotel in Texas, and is the first of nine new Aloft hotels slated to open in the state in the next three years. Owned by Lodging America and managed by Aimbridge Hospitality, Aloft College Station is designed for today’s hyper-connected global traveller with 105 spacious loft-like rooms, tech forward innovation and a buzzing social atmosphere.\n \n \n“Aloft College Station is an ideal fit for this fast-growing area and will appeal to both travelers and locals with its distinctive design aesthetic, dynamic social vibe and live music performances from emerging artists at W XYZ bar,” said Brian McGuinness, Senior Vice President, Specialty Select Brands for Starwood. “As we cross the 100th hotel milestone globally for the Aloft brand, we look forward to continuing this bullish growth momentum in key destinations worldwide.”\n \nAloft College Station is located at the corner of University Drive East and Lincoln Avenue, just minutes from both Texas A&M University and Blinn College. Nearby attractions include the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum, Post Oak Mall, Kyle Field, Grand Station Entertainment Center and the restaurants, bars and music venues in the popular Northgate district. The new Aloft will also be near the Business Center at College Station – home to numerous technology and telecommunications companies.\n \nSignature hotel features include an outdoor Splash pool, a 24-hour gym, re:fuel at Aloft – a one-stop gourmet grab & go food and beverage area, and the brand’s signature W XYZ bar where guests can enjoy a refreshing cocktail and catch the latest up-and-coming music acts as part of the brand’s signature Live@Aloft Hotels music series. The hotel also features 1,500 square feet of flexible meeting space for business meetings and social gatherings.\n \n“Aloft College Station is the hottest new hotel near Texas A&M, and we expect it will quickly emerge as a leading choice among business and leisure travelers to this fast-growing area,” said Zabir Ismail, Managing Director, Lodging America.\n \n \nThe Aloft brand’s innovative and exclusive initiatives set it apart from the competition. Aloft Hotels recently announced the launch of SPG Keyless—an evolution of Aloft’s Smart Check-in— the hospitality industry’s first mobile, keyless entry system allowing guests to use their smart phone as a key. The technology is rolling out to all Aloft, Element and W Hotels Worldwide by year’s end. This forward-thinking initiative is part of the brand’s innovative DNA. Additionally, every Aloft Hotel around the world offers live, free access to local emerging artists and some of the hottest bands with Live@Aloft Hotel programming at the W XYZ® bars.\n \nAloft remains the fastest growing brand in the history of hospitality with 100 hotels in 15 countries now open, and the company’s second largest pipeline.
