The 90-room hotel is now called the Seward Harbor 360 Hotel because of it expansive views of Resurrection Bay and Mount Marathon. The hotel is no longer be part of the Holiday Inn corporation. \nRenovations during the off-season will convert some of the first floor meeting room space to guest rooms, bringing additional space to Seward. Room renovations will include new, comfortable furnishings as well as more family-friendly layouts. The hotel will maintain several guest favorites: a pool, hot tub, and continental breakfast. \n“I’m very excited to take over this hotel and to make it even more part of the local community,” explained Tougas. “Seward is a town with two main identities. We’re a visitor destination in the summer and a marine repair town in the winter. The Harbor 360 Hotel will be open year round because both these communities are important to Seward.” \nBeginning in the summer of 2016, some Major Marine Tours cruises (also owned by Tougas) will depart from docks directly behind the hotel, increasing the convenience of hotel guests and travelers coming to Seward on the Alaska Railroad.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T03:06:20.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
