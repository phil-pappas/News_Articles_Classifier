Leading long-term investors from around the globe, with combined investment potential over $5 trillion , as well as key public officials from organizations such as UN-PRI, WEF, the World Bank, U.S. Departments of Treasury and Transportation, and the IMF gathered.\nThe Washington, D.C. meeting covered a wide range of themes on facilitating long-term and responsible investment in infrastructure in the United States and globally, including the development of infrastructure benchmark, shifts in regulatory treatments, alignment between public and private players, support for inclusive and green development and maximization of social benefits. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx and IMF Deputy Managing Director Min Zhu delivered keynote addresses.\n\"As the country continues to grow by an estimated 70 million in the next thirty years, we're going to find that the infrastructure we built yesterday will not meet tomorrow's needs,\" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx . \"It's clear that we need a great deal of public investment, but the size of our nation's infrastructure deficit also requires us to maximize every financing tool we have available. As we press Congress to pass a long-term, robust transportation bill, we will continue in our efforts to create an environment where more public-private partnerships can happen and where there are more opportunities for the private sector to invest in American infrastructure.\"\nMin Zhu , Deputy Managing Director of the IMF said, \"Globally, we are facing lower growth rates and lower potential growth. Demand policies are needed but are not sufficient. Scaling up infrastructure investments, not only in roads and bridges, but also healthcare and the internet, can help economies grow faster.\"\nThierry Deau , LTIIA's Chairman and CEO of Meridiam, \"Infrastructure has become a catch-all buzz word. Given the impact longterm infrastructure investment can have as a key driver of economic growth and inclusive development, now more than ever, it's important to bring together the key action and thought leaders in the world on a regular basis to focus on asset class essentials- benchmarking, ESG standards, research\".\nEugene Zhuchenko , LTIIA's Executive Director, \"There have been many engaging debates between infrastructure investors, policy makers and academia during this meeting, which set new horizons for LTIIA to pursue on its advocacy efforts, research, education and training. We will continue expanding the offering to our members in all those domains.\"\nThe LTIIA will hold its next meeting in Japan in December 2015 .\nAbout the Long-term Infrastructure Investors Association:\nRegistered in Paris as an international not-for-profit association, the LTIIA was founded in 2014 and counts among its members some of the world's leading institutional investors. The LTIIA is a response to the need for the creation of an industry body that focuses on the fundamental key priorities of promoting private long-term investment in infrastructure, building a risk-adjusted benchmark to foster financial stability, and promoting responsible investment with a special focus on Environmental, Social and Governance considerations.
