Xanterra also plans to build a quick-service restaurant at the complex.\nThe park's struggles with attracting bidders were due mostly to the money that Xanterra was owed for improvements it has made there. Grand Canyon officials responded by borrowing $100 million within the Park Service to reduce what must be paid to Xanterra to about $60 million if another company won the contract. Xanterra now is operating under a temporary contract that expires at the end of the year.\nThe latest proposal for the long-term contract was released in February and included a franchise fee that nearly doubled the 3.8 per cent Xanterra was paying under its previous 15-year contract. The figure was adjusted from a high of 14 per cent in another version of the contract proposal.\nThe Park Service wouldn't say how many bids it received on the long-term contract or the franchise fee Xanterra is paying under its temporary contract.\nXanterra and the Grand Canyon have had a somewhat rocky relationship over the past year. The concessionaire sued the park last October, alleging a contract proposal gave an unfair advantage to a competitor and would result in a money-losing operation. The company also sought to trademark the names of popular hotels and other places at the Grand Canyon. It later dropped both efforts.\nThe Park Service made clear in the latest contract proposal that it considers names like Phantom Ranch, Bright Angel Lodge and El Tovar to be property of the agency, pursuant to its trademark rights under common law.\nDavid Nimkin, Southwest regional director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said he's glad that period is over.\n\"What it portends is a brighter future for the national park, for Grand Canyon, in part because the funding needs for the park are so dire and the ability for them to fulfil some of their needs with an increase in franchise fees is overdue.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T14:18:05.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
