To spend a week with a group of strangers?” said Irene Neuwirth , and while surely there’s some sort of joke to be made about the fashion industry and swimming with sharks, for Neuwirth and fellow designers Thaddeus O’Neil, Albertus Swanepoel , and Shane Fonner, this summer that proposition became a very distinct reality. The four—who between them cover everything from hats and jewelry to menswear and women’s ready-to-wear—banded together with a small clutch of friends and fellow industry insiders on a quick trip to the north coast of Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula to explore Casa Las Tortugas, an artistically minded bohemian hideaway on Isla Holbox. Inspiration ran rampant among the sun, sand, and a day diving with whale sharks, among other local highlights. “They’re the Buddhas of the shark family,” said O’Neil of their aquatic companions. “Very Zen creatures and mysterious. I was swimming over the head of one and it began to dive, and all its massiveness just ghosted into deep green water. A total mirage.” As for Neuwirth, her initial fears were ultimately unfounded: “It turned out to be one of the best trips!” Here, some snaps of their getaway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T22:03:32.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
