Why not make a day trip of it. \nPeople have been walking the ridge of the South Downs Way for millennia. When you walk this trail between Winchester and Eastbourne, you are treading on footsteps worn into the chalk clifftops for at least 8,000 years. \nThe full trail is 100 miles of steady climbs and descents with gorgeous views of the English Channel, The Weald (the rich farmland and forests north of the Downs) and the farmland all around.The hardest parts of this trail are the steep hikes up to or down from the chalk ridge at the start and finish of your walk. Once you are up there it's almost like flying is a desert in the sky. \nDid I say desert? There is no natural water up on the Downs and very little shade as well - just views that go on forever. That's why spring and fall are the best times to visit. On sunny summer days, there's no respite from the blazing sun. And in winter, wind and rain sweep across the downs and there's little hope of shelter. But on clear, mild days walking the downs (with a bottle of water in your backpack) is wonderful. The South Downs an Easier Way \nKeen walkers do it in one go. Luckily, you can enjoy long stretches of this scenic walk without turning it into a week long endurance test. There are dozens of access points along the way well served by rail, local bus and taxi services. And all of them make easy day trips from London. \nBefore you go, pick up a good guide book to the South Downs. Service for digital devices such as SatNavs and GPS phones can be sketchy up on the Downs. It's a good idea to plan your walk with a guide that has good maps and walk itineraries. I recommend the AA Leisure Guides South Downs &Coast by Tim and Anne Locke or the Trailblazer Guides South Downs Way: Winchester to Eastbourne by Jim Manthorpe. Access Points and How to Get To Them \nOnce you've picked your route, getting to the start and finish by public transportation isn't difficult or expensive. Here are just a few sample journeys to key points on the trail to give you an idea: Amberley - The start and finish of several walks on the Downs is served by a train station just outside the village and within an easy walk to a good pub. Trains for Amberley leave from London Victoria every hour and the round trip (purchased in advance as two, one-way tickets) costs £10 (in 2015) and takes less than an hour and a half each way. Buriton and East Meon - Circular walks from these Hampshire villages are within a few miles of Petersfield train station. An advance purchase return (round trip) ticket from London Waterloo costs about £27 and takes just over an hour. Eastbourne and Beachy Head - This 4.5 mile circular walk starts on the western end of Eastbourne Promenade and takes in views from Britain's highest chalk cliff. Trains to Eastbourneleave from London Victoria station and take about an hour and a half. In 2015 a round trip, purchased in advance as two one-way tickets, cost £13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T17:14:50.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
