Our staff are specially trained to deal with such situations. \n\"We would like to express our thanks to the off duty police officer who stepped in, it was a really helpful intervention.\" \nThe woman was 'severely disruptive' forcing the captain to divert. \n\"Our staff acted impeccably and in the best interests of customers and colleagues, despite the extreme nature of the incident,\" added the spokesman. \n\"We would like to apologize to the customers for any distressed caused and also for the short delay to the start of their holiday.\" \nLouise Rowcroft was among those waiting for the flight to land in Turkey so they could get on board to return to the UK. \nDue to the air rage incident, they faced delays of 18 hours. It took a total of 27 hours to get back home. \nShe said: “I’ve just got home as a result of this, the crew were not fit to fly us home so we have been stuck in Turkey. \n“Approximately 250 of us had to fly to Manchester then get a bus back to Newcastle. \n“Can’t fault Thomas Cook.” \nThe airline will assist police with any possible legal action taken against the woman who caused the delay. She has not been named. \nHer male partner also left the flight in Sofia. He had not been involved in the incident. \nEarlier this year Scotsman Andrew Tosh was jailed after he sexually assaulted a female cabin crew member on a Thomas Cook flight. \nThe 34-year-old also swore and acted aggressively to other passengers flying from Glasgow to Dalaman on May 6. \nAfter the flight was diverted to Gatwick Airport in West Sussex, Tosh had to be carried off the plane by police, who released footage of his arrest. \nThey were forced to put him in a hood to stop him spitting at them. \nTosh, of Dundee, pleaded guilty to sexual assault, threatening and abusive behavior, assault and being drunk on an aircraft when he appeared at Lewes Crown Court on June 11. \nHe was jailed for nine months and placed on the sex offender register.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T20:34:23.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
