The zoo keeper in a busy New Zealand zoo was killed by a Sumatran tiger while cleaning the enclosure.\nThe Zoo authorities had not disclosed the incident and kept silent for a day. They revealed on the next day that a tiger named Oz attacked a woman in the zoo. It is the only adult male tiger. Oz is currently safely contained inside his enclosure.\nThe zoo is owned by the Hamilton city council and in a statement the general manager for the community, Lance Vervoort, said that there is always risk for zoo staff in managing big animals but the tiger did not pose a wider risk.\nSince the animal is a rare species and the father of two cubs, he is vital to the ongoing breeding program of conservation.\nBeing a critically endangered breed, the Sumatran tiger with only less than 400 still living in Indonesia, Hamilton Zoo wishes to preserve its 5.\nThe zoo is closed after the attack and will reopen on Thursday. The zoo keeper Kudeweh has had a long experience in zoo keeping before she joined the Hamilton zoo in 2005.\nJeff Neems Council spokesman thinks that the public is safe as all animals mostly remain in safe enclosures. The zoo gets 128,000 visitors a year, and has become the fourth most popular destination in New Zealand.\nThis is not the first time that a zoo keeper was fatally attacked in New Zealand. In 2012 a woman was killed by an agitated elephant at Franklin zoo and wildlife sanctuary, south of Auckland. In another incident a South African woman was mauled and killed by a white tiger in Zion wildlife gardens.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:39:39.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
