Using the creative strapline, “Be Bound for Glory”, the campaign builds on the insight that long-distance travel is usually for something important — whether that’s a big business meeting or meeting the in-laws for the first time – so Virgin Trains will help customers arrive prepared to tackle whatever life may throw their way. The campaign also builds on and reinforces Virgin Trains as leaders in customer experience.\nKatie Knowles, Marketing Director of Virgin Trains on the West Coast, said: “This campaign is fundamentally about how our amazing Virgin Trains experience enables our customers to be ready to take on the world. We know people travel long distances for important things, so we want to show people really ‘nailing it’ when they arrive. “Be Bound for Glory”, which is a big, bold statement that only Virgin Trains could make, does just this.”\nDanny Gonzalez, Marketing and Sales Director of Virgin Trains on the East Coast, said: “Whilst we’re technically two separate businesses, we are all part of the Virgin family. By combining under one masterbrand for this campaign we want to show that, whichever line you travel on, you will still receive the same customer service, comfort and speed for which Virgin is renowned, and wherever your destination, we’ll get you there ready to take on the world.”\nThe campaign will launch over the weekend of the September 19, kicking off with a 60” spot on Saturday during The X Factor, and a 90” spot on Sunday within Downton Abbey. It will then run in this format and as a 30” ad until November 15. The ad, created by krow, tells the story of a young man who is meeting his girlfriend’s family for the first time. Because he travelled there on a Virgin Train, he feels at his absolute best, ready to win them over.\nThe TVC will be amplified by print and outdoor, including a take-over of Waterloo’s IMAX between September 21 and October 4 that utilises Ocean Media’s first dynamic lighting technology, and a domination at London’s Holland Park roundabout.\nTMW Unlimited has created the digital display for the campaign, using dynamic fare information to segment and target potential travellers based on location and profile. TMW Unlimited is also creating content for Virgin Trains’ social channels including The Virgin Trains Name Game, with lucky winners being rewarded with First Class travel. After launch TMW Unlimited will also be creating an online film, which tells the story of how Virgin Trains helps a budding best man ‘Be Bound For Glory’.\nManning Gottlieb OMD’s media planning uses high impact channels including OOH landmarks sites such as the IMAX and M8 banner in Glasgow, plus standout print formats. This is supported by evolved AV planning, combining postcode-targeted Sky AdSmart, VOD, Cinema and terrestrial TV, as well as strong radio and digital activity.\nThe full agency team consists of TMW Unlimited, Manning Gottlieb OMD, Lowe Profero, krow, Amaze and Hope & Glory.\nTVC Credits:\nAgency: krow communications, London, UK\nCreative Directors: Nick Hastings & Tim Robertson\nCreatives: Nick Hastings & Tim Robertson\nAgency Producer: Sushi Tester\nDirector: Traktor\nProduction Company: Rattling Stick\nProduction Company Producer: Ben Roberts\nDirector Of Photography: Daniel Landin\nEditor: Rick Russell @ Final Cut\nAudio: Patch Rowland @ Final Cut\nColourist: Jean Clement @ MPC\nPost production: MPC\nPhotographer: Dan Burn-Forti\nProducer: Danielle Hunt\nAgency producer: Hannah Granshaw\nRetoucher: Nick Gould", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:55:59.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
