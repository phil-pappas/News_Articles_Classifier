The two-metre sculpture, which was part of a commission entitled Land, was created to mark the 50th anniversary of the UK building conservation charity Landmark Trust. The work has been described as “catalysts for reflection” and it was supposed to remain in place until May next year. Professional photographer Anthony Blake took a photograph of the statue lying on its side. Mr Blake said: \"I was running a photographic workshop at Kimmeridge, and when we got here we booked in with a lady who works for the Landmark Trust. \"She asked if we'd come down to photograph the statue. When I said yes, but where has it gone, she told me it had been blown over by the wind earlier that morning.” The Landmark Trust told the Bournemouth Echo: \"We are aware that the \"Land\" sculpture has come down in the storm at Kimmeridge Bay and we are taking steps to deal with it asap.\" A life-sized cast iron statue by Sir Antony Gormley installed at a Dorset beauty spot earlier this summer has been blown over by the wind into the water after a storm Photo: LYDIA GOLDBLATT FOR SEVEN MAGAZINE Howard J Curtis, who spotted the statue lying in the bay, said: \"I know it wasn't popular with everyone.\" The statue had divided local opinion. After it was granted planning permission in 2014, Purbeck District Council's planning committee’s chairman Peter Wharf said: \"I think it is a bit like Marmite, people will either love it or hate it.\" Four other statues in the series stand at Lengthsman's Cottage, Lowsonford, in Warwickshire, Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel, Martello Tower, Aldeburgh, in Suffolk, and Saddell Bay, Mull of Kintyre, in Scotland. When LAND was unveiled Mr Gormley said: \"The sculpture will be like a standing stone, a marker in space and time, linking with a specific place and its history but also looking out towards the horizon, having a conversation with a future that hasn't yet happened.\" Earlier this year, a rural community in Japan was left divided over one of Mr Gormley’s statues . Titled “Another Time XX”, the life-size statue of a naked man in cast iron had been positioned on a ridge in the Kunisaki district of Kyushu in February 2014, ahead of the opening of the Kunisaki Art Festival. The residents of six local villages and the head priests of 27 of the 28 Buddhist temples along the pilgrimage route called for the statue to be removed when they realised it was not a temporary installation.
