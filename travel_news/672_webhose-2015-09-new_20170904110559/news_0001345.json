You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: Jeff Huffman/Flickr \n…Glacier Bay!!! It maybe close to fall, but it is HOT outside, so we are dreaming of cooler temps. When it comes to “cool,” what better place to dream about than Glacier Bay? The National Park Service provides great excursion trips here where you can enjoy all sorts of cool outdoor activities like hiking, camping, mountaineering, kayaking, rafting, fishing, and bird-watching. There’s plenty to keep you busy here, but our favorite Glacier Bay activity might just be simply watching the magnificent glaciers. It’s a sight to soak in and truly savor when you have the opportunity to do so, especially since they unfortunately may not exist in years to come.
