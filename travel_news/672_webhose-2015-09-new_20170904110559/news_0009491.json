These are all core elements of the Etihad Airways brand and service philosophy, now brilliantly showcased in this mobile exhibition.”\nThe mobile product exhibition allows Etihad Airways to bypass the logistical constraints of transporting cabin mock ups to multiple locations, taking its ground-breaking premium products directly to target markets, trade events, and exhibitions.\nThe mobile exhibition vehicle will be painted in Etihad Airways’ ‘Facets of Abu Dhabi’ corporate colours, ensuring optimal exposure of the airline’s branding as it makes its way around Europe.\n \n \nSource:- Etihad Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:35:42.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
