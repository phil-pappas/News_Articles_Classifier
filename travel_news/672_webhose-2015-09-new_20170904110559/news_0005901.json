10:30am 12:40pm - 6:25pm 9:05pm - 12:05am It's worth remembering too that even if your airline directs you to the Air NZ lounge, you're also welcome to use SQ's facilities when they're open if your journey is covered by the access list above.\nSingapore Airlines' first class passengers and Solitaire PPS Club members flying with SQ may also relax in the adjacent SilverKris first class lounge – fittingly, you'll find it by turning left at the entrance.\nDining We found a reasonable breakfast spread during our early visit with yummy hot items such as French toast, eggs and bacon at the ready...\n... along with cereals, yoghurt, fruit salad and banana bread...\n... and an always-open bar with plenty of juice and water for the morning crowd, along with Singapore's signature Tiger beer and other varieties:\nAlthough lacking a barista, the lounge does provide a Nespresso machine at the buffet, but which was extremely slow in producing coffees.\nOn the upside, lounge staff are often found nearby during the morning rush to assist first-time users in preparing their coffees or in selecting their perfect Nespresso pod from the selection provided: a simple and subtle way to improve the passenger experience, but one we're sure that many travellers do appreciate.\nAlso welcome for an international lounge are dishes catering for travellers 'living' in other time zones. Even at 8am (Melbourne time), dumplings and frittata-style party pies were on offer, as was Maggie Beer ice cream.\nAdmittedly, we grabbed the ice cream in our morning haze – assuming it to be yoghurt – but then decided to switch breakfast for brunch.\nTravellers departing later in the day can also find sandwiches, rolls, salads, macarons and sweets to nibble on...\n... and can enjoy their meal at a small number of buffet-adjacent dining tables or at the longer communal bench that's also great for laptop work: Work\nThere are two main aspects that we love about SQ's Melbourne lounge: the first being that solo travellers are well and truly catered for, with almost every seat having its own cocktail table and power outlet...\n... and the second being that the entire lounge has a 'relaxed work' vibe, in that practically every seat is suitable for productivity but equally so for enjoying a nice glass of wine before your long international flight.\nThe seats are also close enough together for couples and groups to converse...\n... but far enough apart that you don't lose the feeling of 'personal space'.\nThere's also high-speed WiFi throughout and a small business centre at the entrance with computing facilities...\n... but as it sits before you enter either the business class or first class lounges, it's easy to overlook and to forget about once you're inside.\nRelax While it's easy to relax almost anywhere in SQ's lounge, one zone makes that particularly easy with plentiful reading material...\n... along with TVs set at an ideal volume: they're loud enough to listen to if the show if of interest, but quiet enough to ignore if you've got other plans.\nShower suites are also available with amenities provided – a staple of any respectable international business class lounge, in which Singapore Airlines doesn't disappoint.\nAlso read: United B787 'BusinessFirst' review: Melbourne-Los Angeles\nFollow Australian Chris Chamberlin Chris lives by the motto that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, a great latte, an opera ticket and a glass of wine!\nFollow @ausbt on @MusoJournoChris\nGoogle+: Chris Chamberlin Share this Review have something to say?

The whole lounge has a surprisingly airy feel to it, despite no external windows and a small footprint. And powerpoints at almost every seat!\nQantas' grim International Business lounge in Melbourne (\"the cave\") could certainly learn something...!\n2 report reply 2 16 hours, 12 minutes ago by prodontome I must say that the times that I have been there, the staff take a LONG time to replenish the food, unlike the Emirates lounge where the food is replenished very frequently and the buffet table is constantly full.\nThe seating and environment is very comfortable though.\n-2 report reply 3 15 hours, 42 minutes ago by Tom Picture 10 gives a good insight into the lounge\n1 report reply 4 13 hours, 56 minutes ago by Rod Looks really nice.My family and relations always fly SQ Business and their lounges are usually excellent.\nThis new lounge would not have to be even just passable to be vastly better than the appalling SQ lounge in Perth. Probably the worst lounge I have ever been in apart from Air NZ in Honolulu.\nThis is obviously a very good Lounge , let's hope SQ recognise what a bloody awful lounge Perth has and make it as good as this one !!!\n0 report reply 5 11 hours, 9 minutes ago by elchriss0 When was the last time this lounge was refurbished?\n0 report reply 6 6 hours, 42 minutes ago by marsala20 Can anyone make comment what extra is available in the First Class part of the lounge?", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/AusBT", "http://chrischamberlin.com.au/follow-on-google-plus/?rel=author", "http://twitter.com/#!/MusoJournoChris", "http://twitter.com/#!/ausbt"], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T22:19:09.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
