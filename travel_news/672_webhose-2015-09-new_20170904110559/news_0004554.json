The Highland flavour may explain why the Queen feels right at home here; she stays at Huka whenever she visits New Zealand.”\nThe Lodge’s luxurious private cottages, sumptuous interiors, range of local experiences and its annual events with upscale partners like Aston Martin and Louis Roedrer Champagne, were also popular with readers who cast their vote in these globally recognised awards.\nFollowed closely behind Huka Lodge in third place was Otahuna Lodge, a magnificent example of 19th century colonial architecture – a grand country house built in Victorian style. Other New Zealand entries in the top 20 were Queenstown’s Blanket Bay and Bay of Island’s Eagles Nest.\nAward-winning accommodation Along with being the first and oldest of its kind to be opened in New Zealand, Huka Lodge is one of the most celebrated with awards ranging from TripAdvisor’s 2014 Travellers’ Choice Award to fifth ranking in the 2013 Top 20 International Hideaways.\nSet within 17 acres of a magnificent Garden of National Significance (noted for its native plantings) on the banks of the teal-hued mighty Waikato River and just above the thundering Huka Falls, Huka Lodge offers a range of luxury accommodation options.\nThere are 18 Jnr Lodge Suites, one Lodge Suite and two exclusive cottages – The Owner’s Cottage and the Alan Pye Cottage – both designed and decorated to reflect the outdoor lovers’ paradise of the Taupo region.\nSimple tented camp Huka Lodge has come a long way since it was founded by Irishman Alan Pye in 1924. It was his simple tented camp, generous hospitality and authentic tales of bountiful trout that brought visitors from around the world to Huka.\nUnder new ownership since 1984, the lodge’s face constantly evolves, searching for innovative ways to give clients luxurious experiences, but the genuine hospitality and breathtaking location continue to underpin the Huka Lodge experience.\nHuka was one of three exclusive New Zealand lodges named in the 2014 edition of the world’s Top 20 Hideaways in the prestigious Andrew Harper’s Hideaway Report.\nInternational luxury travel Luxury travel is a developing sector in New Zealand’s tourism industry.\nDrawn firstly to the unspoilt landscape, international visitors are often blown away by the sophisticated infrastructure and services providing all the trappings of a first-class experience – topped off with peace, privacy and safety.\nDiscerning travellers regularly vote New Zealand as their favourite destination – among them Condé Nast readers who’ve voted New Zealand their favourite country in the world on multiple occasions.\nTravel Tips Huka Lodge is a 3.5 hour drive from Auckland city, a 10-minute drive from Taupo or one hour by road from Rotorua. A helicopter flight from Auckland takes 1 hour.\nSource:- Tourism New Zealand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T06:12:33.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
