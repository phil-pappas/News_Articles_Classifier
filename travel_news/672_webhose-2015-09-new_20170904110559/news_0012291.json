We have, however, been under-performing in some key European markets and will rectify this. We also see other markets such as Africa as a growing source and recently entered into a partnership in Kenya. \n\n“We haven't put down any firm expectations of passenger numbers from 'new' markets at this stage. Our strategy is to rifle-shot high quality B2B partners around the globe and progress slowly but surely.” \n\nTo service an anticipated growth of passenger numbers, new country managers will be introduced in two integral operational destinations: Helmut Krause starts his role as country manager Thailand this month, while William Meyrick has been appointed as country manager Cambodia. Moira Lategan has joined as inside sales and reservations manager. \n\nOn expanding TOI’s DMC coverage in the region, Thailand remains a destination with “enormous potential” despite the recent bomb blast, he reckoned. TOI has been operating in Thailand since 2007 “but we are relatively small there and will expand as that is what our customers are asking us to do”. \n\nTOI recently opened a new office in Chiang Mai in response to the demand. \n\n“Having lived and worked through the tsunami and several coups, I know how very resilient Thai tourism is. So, recent events have not changed our plans in any way,” said Watson, who was former CEO of Diethelm Travel Group. \n\nTOI has over 180 staff who will operate from one central flagship office from this month. The company has also invested in a new fleet of vehicles due for delivery by November, along with the development of training programmes for staff and guides. \n\nIn the fourth quarter, TOI plans XML feeds to key B2B partner sites, along with a new collection of products “to reinforce the brand’s positioning as a provider of high-end experiences to agencies and their clients worldwide”, said Watson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T10:17:37.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
