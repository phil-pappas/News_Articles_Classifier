This image was shot just after a sunset on the roof of a palace at Shugruf village. The scene lasted only for a few seconds and Krivic was able to get just one shot\nA pilgrim during his ritual washing in Lake Sarovar, in the centre of which stands the famous Sikh temple Hari Mandir, the golden temple\nAdventurous day out: Kids playing on the main minaret of the Grand Mosque in Bani using precariously posts as footholds\n'My photographs disclose an individual who is more important than the sacred found in these places, an individual who lives within a community of people that he or she accompanies or defies,' the Slovenian photographer explained to MailOnline Travel.\n'Even when we turn our gaze away from the photograph and close our eyes, we can still hear the story of this individual.\n'I search for moments that portray some beauty and emotion — often filled with silence and grandeur. Whether it is a face, a motion, a mountain, bridge, or temple.'\n Next From Rihanna's beloved Caribbean isle to the Beckhams'... 'How do you wind the window down?' Revealing the most... Pimp my superyacht! From £4m helicopters and custom-built...\nFrom students studying in decaying classrooms, to a dog curled up on warm rubbish by the Ganges, his UrbaniStan photographs capture genuine and unposed moments.\nThe extensive portfolio includes work dating back to 2002, from a total of 15 countries.\n'It would be really hard to pick just one favourite image, since all the photos carry some kind of emotional memory,' he said.\n'But some images never fail to amaze me. Those would be the devotion of Tibetan monks, the biblical serenity of life of Yemeni people, the esoteric rituals of Sufi mystics in Iran and Pakistan, the simplicity of Mali tribes' live and the emotionally charged ceremonies on the river Ganges in Varanasi, India.'\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Passengers use industrial-strength cling film to secure luggage\nWatch video 60 metre superyacht: Take a look at Damen Group's Amels 199\nWatch video Cattle take over Swiss streets for annual Alpabzug ceremony\nWatch video What to expect on the ultimate Moroccan surfing adventure\nWatch video Steph and Dom drink Bloody Marys on air and are escorted out\nWatch video Footage shows unborn baby wriggling inside its mum's belly\nWatch video Miracle baby Jaxon Buell shows off his walking and talking\nWatch video Cereal Killer cafe staff phone for help during protest\nWatch video Pedestrian pinned against wall after near-fatal bus crash\nWatch video Terrified campers flee as huge sinkhole opens up in Queensland\nWatch video Pioc do Ride: Man chooses pitstop voucher for car over date\nWatch video Aerial vision shows extent of the sinkhole on QLD beach\nFollowing the completed religious rituals two Sadhus peacefully sleep on the shore of the river Ganges in Shiva’s sacred town\nYoung Brahmans, members of the highest Indian caste, massaging each other at sunrise on the shores of the sacred river Ganges near Varanasi.
