The workshop is designed to develop capacity of the tourism clusters and to develop strategic work plans for implementation and in view of attracting funding. \nFunded by (united Nations Development Programme) UNDP, the workshop shall also benchmark best practices from the South African experience and identify Unique Sales Propositions for each cluster . \nAccording to John Sempebwa Deputy CEO Uganda Tourism Board (UTB) who is overseeing their development, clusters shall undertake tourism development programs including identifying new products, organizing exhibitions inter alia, a process that is currently ongoing around the respective clusters . \nCriteria is centered on all-inclusiveness, democratic governance, free exit and free entry, registration as Not for Profit trusts, voluntary membership, an elected executive, an office, an account, an officer to run cluster matters and a legal constitution. \nPrior to the formation of clusters the tourism ministry had helped districts develop a framework for District Wildlife Committees (DWC’s) pursuant to The Uganda Wildlife Act 1996. However, with gaps at the district level, the responsibility has now been assigned to UTB. At the moment, there are 11 clusters in the country that are recognized by the Tourism Ministry namely, Busoga, Buganda, Eastern, Acholi, Lango, West Nile, Bunyoro, Rwenzori, Kigezi, Gantone and Ssese Islands. So far the response has been positive with several clusters identifying unique selling products ranging from Bull fighting and Imbalu (male circumcision) ,Source of The Nile and the little known Ik tribe said to have a few words similar to Spanish in their dialect in the Eastern and North Eastern region Ssese islands on Lake Victoria and the Kabaka trail in Central region Mountain Climbing, Water Experiences, Gorilla Tracking ,agro tourism and culture in western region Rock climbing , Sir Samuel and Florence Bakers trail , culture depicting Luo folklore of 'the bead and the spear' , ‘dark tourism ‘ in northern region ; there is even talk of an Idi Amin trail where the late dictator who ruled Uganda in the 70's hails from. \nMeanwhile as part of their initiation into the cluster family, the Lango Tourism Cluster where the event is taking place has organized a charity event dubbed the Ngeta Hill Challenge in aid of the Barlonyo Women who were victims of atrocities during years of insurgency in northern Uganda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T12:11:41.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
