The female dog joined Aeroflot’s Aviation Safety Department Canine Unit in 2008 for cross-breeding aimed to produce progeny of worldly known Sulimov dogs with improved service abilities.\nThis kind of dog — the air company’s pride — was specially bred for Aeroflot’s canine service through crossing the Arctic Herding Laika and the Subtropical Jackal. The Sulimov dog is as hardy, unpretentious, loyal and smart as its Arctic ancestor. The new breed took its good sense of smell from the subtropical relative.\nThese specially-trained dogs live in Aerolflot’s Aviation Safety Department Canine Unit. This unit administers canine service and is an integral part of aviation safety.\nNow our veteran Iki has finished the aviation carrier and is moving to the Moscow Zoo in order to enjoy the well-deserved retirement.\nSource:- Aeroflot", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:31:56.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
