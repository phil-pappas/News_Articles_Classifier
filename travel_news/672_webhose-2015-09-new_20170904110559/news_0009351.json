This is the number of aircraft that are at full capacity when flying out to destinations.\nRyanair's plans to revamp its image and be nicer to customers have paid off, meaning increasing passenger numbers for CEO Michael O'Leary\nThe budget airline - famed for off-hand treatment of passengers that even involved a threat to charge for using the toilet - dramatically changed its tune after a series of profit warnings in 2014.\nOutspoken chief executive Michael O'Leary announced it would stop 'p people off' and its subsequent charm offensive saw passenger traffic increase by 11 per cent to 90.6million customers last year.\n He's in peak condition: Daredevil's terrifying footage of... It's out of this world! Inside the bizarre UFO treehouse... The saily grind: Workers can move their office to the high... Cabin crew and air marshal forced to tie aggressive... The no-frills airline has been pushing to improve its customer service in a programme called 'Always Getting Better' and set out to woo more business travellers.\nRyanair has rolled out a string of initiatives to win over fliers, including allocated seating, new seats with more legroom, improved in-flight meals, extra carry-on luggage and more business-friendly schedules.\nIt is also promising new aircraft interiors and updated uniforms for cabin crew.\nRyanair say customers can look forward to even better things on future flights with the low-cost airline\nAll this is a far cry from the company's previous revenue-boosting ideas.\nIn the past Ryanair talked of replacing 10 rows of seats with a standing area, as well as introducing a coin-operated toilet on some planes.\n'These record monthly numbers and load factors are due to our lower fares, our stronger forward bookings and the continuing success of our “Always Getting Better” customer experience programme,' said Ryanair chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs.\n'It continues to deliver stronger than expected traffic and load factors on our biggest ever summer schedule.\n'Ryanair customers can look forward to more service enhancements in the autumn, as we continue Year 2 of our AGB programme, which include our new car hire service, a new website, new app, new cabin interiors, new crew uniforms, and improved inflight menus, as Ryanair continues to deliver so much more than just the lowest fares in Europe.'\n,", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LXgzGW"], "published": "2015-09-03T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:44:56.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
