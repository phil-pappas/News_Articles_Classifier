Mary O’Rourke, a barrister with Old Square Chambers who has been involved in several landmark cases involving medics in football and rugby, claimed on Tuesday that the Chelsea manager’s attack on Carneiro’s decision to treat Eden Hazard for injury on the opening day of the Premier League season may have offended women. Carneiro and Mourinho argue during the game between Chelsea and Swansea Carneiro, a member of the FMA, is understood to have consulted lawyers over her axing from the bench since upsetting Mourinho by attending to Hazard last month when the Portuguese believed him not to be seriously hurt. “Even if you are a kit man, doctor or secretary on the bench, you have to understand the game,” Mourinho said at the time. Jose Mourinho speaks to the press about the incident involving Carneiro and Fearn Speaking at the Soccerex Global Convention, O’Rourke said: “Everyone listening to that, I think, would have taken that to mean a comment that women don’t know anything about football. “What message are you sending out when you say: 'Women don’t know anything about football’? In today’s age, that shouldn’t be happening. “If you put that statement out to 100 people, I think 99 per cent would interpret that [as being disrespectful] of women supporters or women having a knowledge about football.” TelegraphSportPage Follow @telefootball Telegraph Fantasy Football 2015/16 Get your first team free. £100,000 to be won Pick your free team »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T04:37:32.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
