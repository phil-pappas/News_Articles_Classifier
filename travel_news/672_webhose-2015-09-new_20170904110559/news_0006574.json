The high-fashion runway show set in the stunning and historical backdrop of Banqueting House was attended by 331 guests, with the front row occupied by celebrities including Jerry Hall, Patsy Kensit, Daisy Lowe, Millie Mackintosh and Abbey Clancy. \nThe show featured the British designer’s latest collection, which was inspired by the history of Banqueting House. At the end of the night guests took away goody bags that featured an Elizabeth I motif. Models showcasing Deacon’s 18th century inspired clothing included Poppy Delevigne, Georgia May Jagger, Irina Shayk and Eva Herzigova. The circular layout of the show allowed the models to weave in and out of the audience, with the seating plan mirroring the oval central panel of the Rubens ceiling, 'The apotheosis of King James I'. A large 'totem-like' pole adorned with wheatsheafs and golden beetles crawling to the top designed by Christopher Woods was situated at the centre of the seating arrangement. Jennifer Lockham, Banqueting House Manager, said: “We are delighted to not only have hosted Giles Deacon’s SS16 high-fashion runway show at the venue, but to have been the inspiration behind his collection. The grandeur and versatility of Banqueting House made it the perfect setting to accommodate all of the show’s requirements.” Giles Deacon, commented: “This is the second year I have worked in conjunction with Historic Royal Palaces and I was thrilled this year to showcase my SS16 collection in the historical setting of Banqueting House. The fabulous architecture of the venue was a key inspiration for me in designing the collection.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T05:42:18.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
