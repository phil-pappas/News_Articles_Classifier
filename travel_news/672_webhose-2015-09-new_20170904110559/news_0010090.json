Only15% prefer to receive their boarding passes from an agent at an airport check-in counter. In the event of a travel disruption, 60% of travelers would prefer to be informed and offered new booking options via a kiosk or the internet or sent a new boarding pass electronically. \n“I congratulate Alaska Airlines on attaining Platinum status. The IATA Global Passenger Survey confirms that passengers want to do more things for themselves and Alaska is certainly an early responder to that trend,” said Paul Behan IATA Director Passenger. “By offering Fast Travel options to 81.92% of its customers, Alaska has shown a deep understanding and commitment to meeting the changing desires of air travelers.” \n“Our mission is to be the easiest airline to fly and we’re honored to receive this recognition, which tells us we’re on-track towards meeting that goal,” said Ben Minicucci, Alaska Airlines’ Executive Vice President and COO. “Flying should be convenient and simple. At Alaska, we’re working hard to pioneer the use of technology that will reduce wait times and let our customers speed through check in and security.” Minicucci said Alaska is continuing to innovate using technology in hopes of creating a more hassle-free travel experience. \nFor 2015, IATA is targeting Fast Travel access for at least 35% of passengers and by 2020, 80% of air travelers should be offered a complete suite of self-service options based on industry standards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:49:14.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
