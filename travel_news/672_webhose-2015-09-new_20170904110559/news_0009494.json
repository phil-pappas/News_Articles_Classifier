Therefore, we are targeting the affluent and young urban professionals in Indonesia,” he said. \n\nThe campaign launch follows the opening of a Holland Alliance representative office in Jakarta in May, where AVIAREPS was appointed as its representative in South-east Asia. \n\nIn 2014, about 42,000 Indonesians visited Holland and this year, a target of 45,000 arrivals is expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T06:30:16.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
