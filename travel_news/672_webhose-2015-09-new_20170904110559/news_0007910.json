(NASDAQ: CY) today introduced a new automotive capacitive touchscreen controller family that enables screen sizes up to 15-inches with industry-leading performance in harsh automotive environments. The new Automotive TrueTouch ® CYAT8168X controller uses Cypress's proprietary AutoArmor™ technology for robust immunity to the strong electromagnetic interference (EMI) emissions found in cars, buses and trucks. The controller delivers a flawless user experience even with water droplets, condensation or sweat on the touchscreen. Additionally, the controllers provide industry-leading tracking of fingers in gloves, allowing drivers to operate the touchscreen without having to take off their gloves.\nCypress AutoArmor meets car manufacturers' most challenging electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements for chip-level emissions (IEC 61967), conducted (IEC 62132) and radiated (ISO 11452) immunity, as well as for system-level (CISPR 25) specifications. AutoArmor uses automatic frequency hopping to prevent false touches caused by EMI from other electronic systems, and it uses TX frequency spreading to reduce electromagnetic emissions by up to 30%. In addition to AutoArmor, the Automotive TrueTouch CYAT8168X controller includes up to 88 I/Os with a host processor interface through I 2 C or SPI, which help improve touchscreen responsiveness.\n\"With the addition of our Automotive TrueTouch CYAT8168X touchscreen controller family, Cypress now offers our customers the most robust solution for harsh automotive environments, giving drivers the perfect user experience they expect,\" said Dr. Jing Mu , Senior Director of Automotive HMI Marketing for Cypress. \"The robust EMI immunity, water tolerance and gloved finger tracking of our new automotive touchscreen controllers demonstrate Cypress's commitment to expand our automotive portfolio with solutions that enable world-class performance and features in next-generation vehicles.\"\nThe Automotive TrueTouch CYAT8168X controller family delivers best-in-class accuracy and linearity for fingers of different sizes and gloves of various materials and thicknesses, including ski gloves, and automatically switches between glove and finger tracking without requiring the drivers to switch settings. With Cypress's unique and patented DualSense™ technology to execute both self-capacitance and mutual-capacitance measurements in the same device, the family offers the industry's best water rejection and wet finger tracking for seamless performance in real-world conditions, including the presence of water droplets, condensation, or sweat. The controllers are based on a 32-bit ARM ® Cortex ® M-Core processor that is known for high-efficiency MIPS/mW. The TrueTouch portfolio's unique features are backed by an industry-leading portfolio of more than 100 capacitive touch sensing patents.\nAvailability\nThe Automotive TrueTouch CYAT8168X controllers are currently sampling, with AEC-Q100 fully automotive-qualified products expected in the first quarter of 2016. The controllers are available in automotive-friendly 128-pin and 100-pin TQFP packages.\nAbout TrueTouch\nCypress's TrueTouch technology provides the industry's best noise immunity, highest SNR, best waterproofing, fastest refresh rates, lowest power consumption, and world's best accuracy and linearity. The flexible TrueTouch solution allows customers to rapidly develop leading-edge solutions without having to buy turnkey modules. They have a choice of using touch sensors (glass or film) and LCDs from preferred partners, and can develop innovative mechanical designs ranging from flat to curved surfaces of varying thickness. The patented capacitive sensing technology of TrueTouch devices offers robust noise immunity that enables flawless operation in noisy RF and LCD environments.
