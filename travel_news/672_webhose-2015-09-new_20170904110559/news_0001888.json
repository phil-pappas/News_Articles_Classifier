A stuntman is consumed by flames as he desperately holds on to the car driving through flames. Picture: Fox Sports Caroline Zielinski News Corp Australia Network Share Email a friend \nWHILE extreme stunts are fascinating — both to watch and try — they are more often than not dangerous. \nWe have complied a list of five stunts that seemed like a good idea, but that, in the end, just went horribly wrong. \n1. Dean Potter’s extreme jump \nExtreme American climber and base jumper Dean Potter, 43, known for stunts such as walking barefoot on a rope connected between two mountain peaks in Enshi, Hubei province in China, took it a step too far earlier this year when he and fellow extreme athlete Graham Hunt, 29, decided to jump off a cliff in Yosemite National Park. \nDespite wearing wingsuits designed to help them fly clear of an outcrop on the cliff face, the pair failed to get past it, and tragically plunged to their death jumping from a spot 915 metres above the valley floor. \nIn 2008, Potter told The New York Times that while a part of him thought it was crazy for a person to attempt to fly, “another part of me thinks all of us had the dream that we can fly. Why not chase after it?” \n2. The “Death Swing” at Hanging Rock \nOnly a week ago, Aussie daredevil Toby Benham, 32, known as Lucky Chance, fatally smashed into jagged rocks at Hanging Rock, Blackheath, while trying to complete a Blue Mountains clifftop stunt known as the “Death Swing”. Hanging Rock, Blackheath ... Scene where Toby Benham, aka Lucky Chance, died. Picture: Supplied Source: The Daily Telegraph \nA former Lennon Brothers Circus performer, he spent weeks recovering in a French hospital from another cliff jump gone wrong about four years ag, where broke his pelvis, his lung collapsed and he was in a coma. \nThis time, however, he wasn’t as lucky. \nHanging Rock, where Lucky Chance died, is a popular location for rope swinging. Toby Benham also known as \"Lucky Chance\" who was killed after swinging from a rope attached to Hanging Rock in the Blue Mountains.

Near-drown \nEscape artist Spencer Horsman’s public performance at the State Theatre last night went seriously wrong after he got into massive trouble while performing his “Water Torture Cell” stunt, which includes Horsman submerging himself, wrapped in metal chains, in a see-through glass and metal box filled with water. \nHe and the box are hoisted into the air as he is supposed to be freeing himself.

Four men then rushed over to unlock the box and quickly dragged his limp body out. He was rushed to the hospital soon after.

Driving through fire \nWhen one daredevil thought it’d be clever to lie down on the outside of a jeep and have someone drive it through a burning wall, he probably thought, what could go wrong? Aflame ... The stuntman desperately holds on as the car drives through the burning circle. Picture: Fox Sports Source: Supplied \nPlenty, it transpired. After crashing through the burning wall, the stuntman is lit on fire, panics, lets go of the car, falls down on the ground and is run over by the car. \nCuriously, the stuntman appears unharmed and just walks off afterwards. Hmmm. Under the wheels ... The daredevil is shown being run over the car after the stunt goes horribly wrong.

The drunk trampoline bounce \nConsidering that most daredevil stunts are by their very nature extremely dangerous, going into them drunk adds just another layer of insanity. \nSo when UK prankster Jordan Adlard, 26, decided to jump off a very high tree and onto a trampoline at a party while drunk, it’s a mirage he even survived. \nSelf-dubbed as the “human cannonball”, Adlard was at his cousin’s party when he decided to leap onto a trampoline from a 6-metre tree. \nWhile not clear what he expected to happen, the result was pretty tragic: he bounced off and smashed into a wooden fence, breaking his back. \nBut wait for the kicker: he didn't actually find that out until eight days later, after he went to the hospital following a breakdancing episode which finally revealed the pain. \nAccording to The Mirror , doctors told Adlard that he had in fact suffered a compression fracture in his spine, which would have almost certainly become permanently damaged had he waited much longer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T08:49:38.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
