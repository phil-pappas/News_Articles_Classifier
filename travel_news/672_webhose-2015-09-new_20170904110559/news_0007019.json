Florida's consumer confidence up despite Wall Street Consumer confidence across Florida grew slightly from July to August, but the numbers might not fully reflect the recent roller-coaster ride of the stock market, according to a University of Florida report released Monday. The university's Survey Research Center in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research placed consumer sentiment at 91.2, up from 90.5 in July, on a consumer-confidence scale that ranges from 2 to 150. The latest number reflects perceptions by consumers that the U.S. economy will be better in the next year and the next five years, with the monthly figure balanced by an expectation by most consumers that their personal incomes will decline over the next year.
