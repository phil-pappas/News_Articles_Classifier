But what about what NOT to take? How many of us come back from holiday with an overstuffed suitcase, filled with things we never used? • Perfume or aftershave The beauty of being on safari is completely immersing yourself in the experience – and that means enjoying the sights, sounds and scents of your surroundings. In the heat, perfume on your skin can give you a rash, and if you’re going near animals, strong perfume can make them more wary than usual, plus it can attract mosquitoes. My evening routine – if I have time, once I’ve rolled in from a day safari – is to shave, and instead of applying aftershave, I’ll liberally douse myself with insect repellent. • Jewellery There are so many incredible pieces of jewellery to buy in Africa; not only will you help the local craftspeople, you’ll come away with something that tells a story and, each time you wear it, you’ll remember how you felt at the time. There’s lots of beautiful beadwork, ethnic tribal pieces, iridescent shells , tanzanite – a stunning type of sapphire – which is only found in Tanzania. . . . and South African diamonds, of course, at a range of different prices. • Safari clothing It can be quite hard to find decent safari gear in England, but the airports and lodges in Southern Africa are all filled with good quality stuff at reasonable prices, including safari boots. So instead of stressing yourself out holiday shopping before you go, just get it out there. In the UK, a good pair of safari boots can cost upwards of £100 – over there, they'll cost you £20-30. • Jeans These are heavy to pack, too warm to wear during the day and hard to dry when they get wet. • Smart evening clothes You're likely to fall in from your day out on the plains and go straight for dinner . A safari is the ultimate dress-down holiday, when no one really thinks about their appearance. • Most of your clothes It’s tempting to pack enough clothes for the entire duration of your safari, but you’ll find that you can almost always get items of clothing laundered at the lodges, usually on the same day – laundry is included at a few lodges. • A hard suitcase You’re much better off with a durable canvas holdall because it will need to be squeezed into the back of your safari four-wheel drive if you’re staying at more than one lodge. And if you're taking light aircraft flights it will need to be squeezed into small spaces underneath the aircraft. Of course, there are some things I would recommend taking. Before my first safari I wish people had told me to take a torch for getting around the camp at night. Eye drops are useful because being out in the glare of the sun and the dust can dry out your eyes, and antihistamines are great if you do get bitten, because it helps with the itching and swelling. And always pack your common sense!
