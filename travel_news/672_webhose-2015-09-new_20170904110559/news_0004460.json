What we see at the moment is visitors to Australia from mainland China paying around seven times more for their visas than visitors from Hong Kong or the United States.\n“Other countries recognise the economic benefits generated by Chinese tourists and are taking visa reform seriously in order to capture their share of the burgeoning and valuable Chinese market. For example, the Canadian government reduced their visa fees early last year to promote tourism and the South Korean government introduced a $90 (USD) 5-year multiple entry to encourage Chinese visitors. We must adopt the same mentality.\n“We also need to invest more in destination marketing to make sure Australia, as a great tourist destination, is front and centre in the minds of the 200 million Chinese expected to travel abroad in 2020.\nSource:- TTF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T14:11:28.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
