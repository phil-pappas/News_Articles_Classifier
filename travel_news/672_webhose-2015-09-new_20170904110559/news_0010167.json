As a global health services provider, we welcome these initiatives and see this growth as an opportunity to expand our footprint in the region,\" said Howard Gough , CEO for Middle East , North Africa , and Global Individual Private Medical Insurance (IPMI) of Cigna International, a company dedicated to helping people improve their health, well-being and sense of security around the globe.\nRenée-Marie Stephano , President of the Medical Tourism Association® , said chronic and non-communicable diseases have been an unfortunate fact of life in not only the Middle East and North Africa , but throughout the world. In fact, chronic and non-communicable diseases represent 63 percent of all deaths, 80 percent of which is located in middle- and low-income nations.\n\"Despite the best attempts by some governments to curb outbound travel for health services, patients are seeking treatments elsewhere for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancer and genetic disorders like diabetes,\" said Stephano, who noted the collaborative role Cigna International played in coordinating the sixth Global Ministerial Summit, held in conjunction with the Congress, in the Orange County Convention Center. \"Avenues, such as the Ministerial Summit, serve as a forum for government leaders – many of whom are already appropriating millions of dollars to reinvigorate existing healthcare facilities and construct new venues that appeal to medical tourism patients -- to rethink and evaluate strategies and, perhaps, form partnerships to facilitate progress.\"\nThe Ministerial Summit attracts government decision-makers -- including ministers of health, tourism and economic development, health attachés, trade commissioners, and consul generals -- who represent nations that are providers of healthcare or those that purchase these services from abroad.
