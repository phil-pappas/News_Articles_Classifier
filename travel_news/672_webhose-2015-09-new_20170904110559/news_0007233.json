The Group has also strengthened its presence in Chile and entered a new market in Ecuador. \nNH Hotel Group’s expansion in Colombia follows its acquisition of Hoteles Royal, a Latin American chain with 20 hotels in Colombia, Chile and Ecuador, earlier this year. This acquisition was followed by an integration of systems, services and brand image with the objective to deliver the best service, superb locations, knowledge of local culture, plus the latest technology and extraordinary gastronomy under the NH Royal name and concept. The integration of Hoteles Royal signals an important milestone for NH Hotel Group. Colombia is a strategic country for the Group’s development in Latin America, where the global company now operates 57 hotels and more than 10,000 rooms in 10 countries. Consequently, Colombia now represents the Group’s largest presence in the continent, and its fifth highest in the world, with hotels in the cities of Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla and Cartagena. The NH Hotel Group portfolio in Colombia now includes 15 hotels with 1,700 rooms; 8 of which have been transformed into the upper-upscale brand NH Collection and 7 into the NH Hotels brand*. Each hotel combines Colombian hospitality with excellence in management, service and comfort standards, as well as high-end gastronomy from renowned international chefs and top technology innovations, for both business and leisure, together with comprehensive facilities for events and meetings. Additionally, NH Hotel Group has integrated Grupo Royal’s international hotels in Latin America. These include 4 properties in Chile, located in Santiago de Chile, Antofagasta, Iquique and Concon - 2 two of which will remain under the NH Collection brand and 2 under NH Hotels - as well as a hotel in Quito, Ecuador, housed under the NH Collection brand. To mark the Group’s expansion, an international launch party was held at NH Hotel Group’s flagship Latin America hotel, NH Collection Royal Teleport, on Thursday 10th September 2015. This high-profile event was attended by Juan Manuel Santos Calderon, President of Colombia; Taleb Rifai, General Secretary of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO); Cecilia Álvarez-Correa, Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism; and other top Colombian business and society figures. The renowned 2-Michelin starred chef Paco Roncero (La Terraza del Casino), designed and served creative cuisine at the event. Federico J. González Tejera, CEO of NH Hotel Group, said “Colombia is becoming more and more attractive, and it is our intention to continue our growth in this destination and to be an active part of the country’s development, providing our knowledge and experience to boost its tourism evolution and visitor numbers. It represents a strategic market that will strengthen our presence in the region. We feel excited to offer our products and service excellence to provide a memorable experience for leisure and business travellers.” During the presentation event in Colombia, Rafael Roldán, President of Federation of Official Spanish Chambers of Commerce in America (FECECA) - which encourages the development of economic, commercial, cultural and scientific relations between Spain and Latin America - awarded a special recognition to NH Hotel Group for pursuing its development in Latin America. This award acknowledges the company’s international growth and its commitment to offer excellent service throughout the world. NH Hotel Group has one of the most extensive and attractive hotel portfolios in Latin America for both business and leisure travellers, as well as for the meetings and events segment. Currently, the Group’s presence in the Americas comprises Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, USA, Haiti, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela. Furthermore, NH Hotel Group is also one of the largest hotel chains in Europe, operating 325 hotels in 17 countries.
