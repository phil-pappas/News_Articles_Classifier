It lays eggs in clothes hanging out to dry. Upon contact with human skin the eggs hatch. The larvae burrow into the skin and develop into fully grown maggots if left to their own devices. The unfortunate human host develops multiple boil-like sores, usually on the backs of arms, around the waist, back or bottom. The medical name for this condition is Myiasis . \nIt's unlikely you will have any issues while just visiting the continent for an organized holiday or safari . Safari camps and lodges have laundry facilities and your clothes will be returned to you in a neatly ironed pile. But if you are planning a self-drive safari , or if you are going to live or volunteer in East or Central Africa you want to make sure to avoid getting \"putzi's\" in your skin. Avoiding Putzi Larvae from Hatching in Your Skin ... \nThe best way is to make sure you iron all your clothes as the heat of the iron kills the eggs and stops them from hatching in your body. If there is no way to iron your clothes, hang them inside to dry instead. \nIf you do have the misfortune of being a host to the Putzi fly's offspring, you may notice little red bumps that look similar to regular spots or \"zits\". Ask a local person to diagnose as they will recognize them quicker than you will. The \"zits\" will grow larger and larger if left on their own and end up resembling a huge boil. \nUnfortunately for some, myself included, the tropics can cause many a strange sore to mysteriously appear so an immediate correct diagnosis isn't always going to happen. The larvae that burrowed in to my back a few times (I grew up in Malawi ) were undiagnosed for so long they grew to be a few inches long and what they finally left behind, once extracted, wasn't a pretty sight. It was also quite painful. What To Do if It's Too Late ... \nOnce discovered putzis are easily removed . A dab of Vaseline followed by a good squeeze will do the trick. The Vaseline stops the maggot from being able to breathe and out it pops. But try to catch them earlier than I did, or it is very painful to remove and leaves quite the gaping wound. Luckily it's a topical issue so there's no further danger other than leaving you feeling grossed out and perhaps a bit run down due to the infected skin. Final Words of Wisdom \nTo avoid becoming the host of Putzi fly offspring, the simple solution is to iron all your clothes (including underwear). The heat of the iron kills the eggs. This isn't always possible while traveling so dry your clothes inside to avoid the putzi flies laying their eggs in them. If you do get putzi larvae under your skin, use a dab of vaseline to suffocate them and that should do the trick. \nFor more details on the larvae stage see the Merck Veterinary Manual . \nFor more details on staying safe an healthy while traveling in Africa , check out more of my articles and resources ...
