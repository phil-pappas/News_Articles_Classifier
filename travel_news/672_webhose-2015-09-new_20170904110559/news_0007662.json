Pastry is my big favourite, and my own baking forte. I wasn’t bowled over by anybody’s pastry techniques, and a few things really made me think, “Crikey!” For example, there was an awful lot of flour flying about throughout the episode. I never use extra flour to roll my pastry because it ruins the mixture. I use a technique where I roll it between two freezer bags – and I didn’t see anybody try any variation. The judges were complimentary about some exciting flavour combinations. But this is not MasterChef, it’s a baking competition. To be on Bake Off you should be well-versed in pastry, shouldn’t you? Photo: BBC The first task was a frangipane tart, which requires a sweet shortcrust pastry base. It’s the hardest pastry to handle but the most delicious: crispy, light, thin. Those are the fundamentals, but nobody had achieved those. Nothing looked to me like it came out of a patisserie window. Paul’s looked the best but the judges said his pastry was underdone. Some of the bakers’ comments revealed early on that they weren’t experienced pastry chefs. Mat said, “Oh, it’s shrunk!” when he took his base out of the oven, as if he was surprised that pastry shrinks. Photo: BBC The technical challenge was odd, too, because almost everybody appeared to forget that it was pastry week. My grandmother used to say that you need heavy hands for bread and light hands for pastry, so I was surprised that so many of them were throwing their flaouna dough around like it was bread. It was confusing because the recipe contained yeast – as does a Danish pastry, however that doesn’t mean you treat it like bread. Kneading stretches the gluten, which I would have thought would ruin the pastry. Still, it’s easy to lose your head with a recipe and ingredients you’ve never seen before. Nervous Nadiya Photo: BBC Flora should be commended for those sweet vol-au-vents because chocolate can be tough for a pastry, and she was brave to try it. On the whole, she’s getting distracted by too many frills and extras – but on this occasion it paid off. I felt sorry for Nadiya in the vol-au-vents challenge. She might have been alright if she hadn’t made a second batch of pastry. The judges made the right decision in the end, though. Alvin has had too many timing issues over the series. I was pleased for star baker Mat. He’s really improved now that he’s starting to have confidence… As for predictions, I used to think that Tamal was the series’ secret gem but he’s had a couple of bad weeks where he’s not been outstanding. Now I really don’t know.  nancybirtwhistle.co.uk, @nancybbakes Interactive: British bake off week 7 @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:46:41.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
