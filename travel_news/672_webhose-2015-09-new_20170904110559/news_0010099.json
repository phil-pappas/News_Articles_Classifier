The market size has been calculated based on the spending on railway infrastructure. In addition, the report presents the economic outlook of China and an analysis of the infrastructure development in the country. It also presents the major drivers influencing the growth of railways in the country. It discusses the major challenges faced by the vendors and the industry at large, as well as the key trends emerging in the market.\nTo attract private investment in railway infrastructure, the government liberalized rail freight prices, stimulating the growth of railway spending and the demand for rail transportation in the country. In April 2014 , the NDRC approved liberalization of freight railway fees based on the market demand, which was earlier controlled solely by the government. In December 2014 , the government deregulated the price control on rail cargo, railway parcel shipping, and passenger fares. Such initiatives by the government will create demand for a new and expanded railway network, triggering the growth of railway infrastructure spending in the less-developed regions of China .\nAccording to the report, increased government initiatives toward developing infrastructure and boosting investment opportunities in the railway infrastructure will trigger market growth. In October 2014 , the government launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to promote investments in infrastructure development in China and other Asian countries. As the government is burdened by high debts in the infrastructure sector, it is encouraging private investment in energy and transport infrastructure through the BOT model. In this, a public entity delegates the construction project, which includes design, construction, finance, and operation of a particular facility to a private firm.\nFurther, the report states that the weak legal and regulatory framework of China hinders the market's growth.\nKey Vendors\n- China Communications Construction\n- China Railway Construction\n- China Railway Group\n- China State Construction Engineering\nOther Prominent Vendors\n- China Railway Signal & Communication\n- Dongfang Electric\nKey Topics Covered:\nExecutive Summary List of Abbreviations Scope of the Report Market Research Methodology Introduction China : Country Outlook Construction Industry in APAC Construction Market in China Railway Infrastructure in China Vendor Selection Criteria Market Growth Drivers Drivers and their Impact Market Challenges Impact of Drivers and Challenges Market Trends Trends and their Impact Vendor Landscape Key Vendor Analysis For more information visit http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/sn7bwl/railway\nMedia Contact:\nLaura Wood , +353-1-481-1716, press@researchandmarkets.net\n releases/china-railway-infrastructure-spending-market-2015-2019---market-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-267-300135901.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN90193&Transmission_Id=201509010910PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN90193&DateId=20150901", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20130307/600769", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-railway-infrastructure-spending-market-2015-2019---market-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-267-300135901.html", "http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/sn7bwl/railway"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:55:23.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
