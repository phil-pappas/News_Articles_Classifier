Life tells the story of photographer Dennis Stock (Robert Pattinson) who was assigned to photograph a rebellious young actor on the cusp of stardom, James Dean (Dane DeHaan). The two take a trip from LA to Dean’s hometown of Fairmont, Indiana, via Times Square, New York so that Stock could, in his words, capture Dean in all the environments that had “affected and shaped the unique character”. Stock thinks he’s capturing a star in the moment before he breaks; in fact, he’s documenting Dean’s last moments of intimacy and simplicity. Their trip would result in some of the most iconic images of the age and a new breed of film star. Life is in cinemas on Saturday, September 25. You can view the official trailer here .
