There were only three attacks off New South Wales last year, including two fatalities.\nDaniels, who surfs daily, said he was paddling his board out to sea when a 1.8-meter (6-foot) shark struck from beneath.\n\"'Bang,' it felt like a battleship hitting my board. Threw me straight off up into the air,\" Daniels said. \"My board got separated from me, then I saw the shark underneath me.\"\nDaniels swam 3 metres (10 feet) back to the board \"and paddled like hell in.\"\nThe only fatal attack off New South Wales this year occurred Feb. 9 when Japanese tourist Tadashi Nakahara, 41, lost both legs while surfing off Ballina. Another six attacks have resulted in injuries.\nSharks are common off Australia's beaches, but fatal attacks are rare. The country has averaged fewer than two deadly attacks per year in recent decades.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:27:35.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
