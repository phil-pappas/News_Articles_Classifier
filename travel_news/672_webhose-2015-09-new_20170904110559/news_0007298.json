To see four million passenger months in a row, given it was only 2 years ago that we broke the million mark, is remarkable.\n“The team at Edinburgh Airport is committed to providing the infrastructure and facilities to enable and cope with the growth in those that want to visit our country and those Scots that wish to travel whether for leisure or business. We’re focussed on planning for the year ahead and staying ahead of the passenger demand.”\nAugust 15 August 14 % Chg Domestic 467,120 428,935 +8.9% International 691,674 637,409 +8.5% Total 1,158,794 1,066,344 +8.7% MAT 10,791,988 10,067,412 +7.2%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T01:25:14.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
