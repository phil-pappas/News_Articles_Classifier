Jeppesen, a part of Boeing Commercial Aviation Services, now provides JetBlue with paperless navigation and flight information, including use of digital enroute charting materials. JetBlue successfully received clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to eliminate paper flight information from its operations.\nUse of Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro will let JetBlue remove four tons of paper-based materials from its aircraft. This elimination of paper weight from its fleet will allow the airline to save $400,000 in fuel costs annually, through reduced consumption. The elimination of shipping costs related to paper flight materials also will achieve an annual savings of approximately $420,000 for JetBlue. FliteDeck Pro helps to reduce pilot workload and preparation time, increase situational awareness in flight, with easy access to operational information, and lower operating costs through reduced fuel use.\n\"Teaming with Jeppesen and use of FliteDeck Pro on iPad has allowed us to receive this authorization and achieve fully paperless operations, including use of digital enroute charts,\" said Chuck Cook , manager, Fleet Technology, JetBlue. \"We look forward to continued operational benefits and improved efficiency through use of digital flight information. It eliminates heavy flight bags on our aircraft and provides a wealth of vital information that is scalable and displayed on-screen per the preferences of our pilots.\"\nJeppesen FliteDeck Pro helps airlines and large operators streamline access to essential flight information and Jeppesen's industry-leading navigation data. With FliteDeck Pro, JetBlue receives vector-based terminal charts and data-driven enroute content, which is dynamically rendered on-screen for improved situational awareness in the flight deck.\n\"We congratulate JetBlue on establishing fully digital flight operations, which is a significant achievement for streamlining procedures and reducing costs in a highly competitive airline market,\" said Alex Zakroff , vice president, Jeppesen Navigation Solutions. \"The use of digital flight information in the flight deck enhances situational awareness for JetBlue pilots and the use of digital enroute charts completes JetBlue's digital transformation as a leader in paperless airline operations.\"\nJetBlue carries more than 32 million customers annually to 90 cities in the U.S., Caribbean, and Latin America with an average of 875 daily flights.
