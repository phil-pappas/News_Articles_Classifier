We select 10 destinations, from Dubai to Tenerife, that might do the trick Nothing beats beach fun during the October half term Photo: Getty By Sophie Butler Comments \nIn theory, October half term should be a great week for a family holiday. It gives everyone a break from the longest school term of the year, and a last chance to enjoy some sunshine before the clocks go forward and the November fogs set in. The problem is that this late in the year, you can’t be sure of reliable weather in many of the most popular Mediterranean destinations. Sure, it will be warmer than at home, but there is a risk of rain and generally unsettled weather. \nA few destinations stand out, however, and if you head far enough south, you can still be reasonably confident of warm sunshine without having to endure a long flight. \nBelow, we have picked 10 of the best options, and highlighted packages which still have availability for departures on the first weekend of half term – October 24 and 25. \nYou will need to act fast to get a holiday at a reasonable price, however. Demand for flights has been high across the board this year – reflecting both the improving economy and government policy on fining parents who take children on holiday during school terms – and this has pushed up prices. \nMiami's South Beach at dawn Photo: Alamy \nFor each destination below we have tried to find one package which still has availability at a reasonable price, plus a more luxurious option. But in some cases the high level of demand for flights means that, even with a month to go before departure, there is virtually nothing left for less than £1,000 a head. \nAll quotes below are per person based on a family of four (two adults, two children under 12) sharing a family room for seven nights including breakfast. Return flights departing either on October 24 or 25, and transfers are also included unless stated otherwise. Flights may be available from alternative airports to those mentioned, but are likely to be more expensive. All are subject to availability. \nThe best strategy for a cheap half-term holiday this late in the day is to book your arrangements independently, cut down on the length of the trip, and fly from, say, Monday to Friday. That way you aren’t competing with families looking for a weekend flight. \nUse skyscanner.net to track down the cheapest flight options, and for recommended hotels see our destination guides at telegraph.co.uk/destinations . Florida \nAverage peak temperature : 84°F (29°C) Hours of sun per day : seven \nIt may be a long flight, but if you want to go to Florida, October is a much better time to travel than during the very hot and humid summer holidays.
