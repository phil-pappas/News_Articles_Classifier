A lot of browser games are now available for gamers, all with different genres and categories, so we decided that today we are going to talk about the browser MMORPG 2015 in specific. In other words, we are going to focus on some of the best MNORPG games on the market and give you a glimpse of its features and an overall idea of the game itself.So let`s take a closer look on what the gamers have been talking about within this category. Stormfall: Age Of War: Plarium (the developer and the publisher) has released a 2D strategy mystical game. According to lord Oberon`s will, you were chosen to reunite the fallen Stormfall empire against the repetitive conquer attempts performed by evil opponents (yea I know, sounds like a huge responsibility). Have full command of your own castle, upgrade it with defensive walls to stand against the attacks and make the best use of the ancient scrolls and resources that fall under your hand. One last thing, create your own league and start brining other ones down. Sounds cool I know. League Of Angels: Yea exactly what I thought the moment I saw it, those angels are too hot for an online 2D game. Yet this is how R2Games managed to introduce it to the gamers (not that we are mad or anything about it). Players are supposed to fight evil in order to save those gorgeous angels which I am sure that nearly every gamer will do it gladly. Both the warrior and mage classes come in different genders. PvP battles across the servers are allowed too in order to boost your resources collected from the points.READY TO FIGHT FOR THE ANGELS? , Hell yea I am sure you are. Arcane Legends: Highly customizable pet system, Action-oriented combat and last but not least, the most amazing feature of this 3D amazing game, an IOS/Android support, all brought to you by SpaceTime Studios. There are three available classes that you can choose from, the Warrior, the Rogue and the Sorcerer. Multiple can be unlocked while you are playing and the game is using more of the RPG system in its game play where players must hold press the attack button or tap it to perform single and powerful charged attacks (no Auto attacks). Last but not least, you don`t have to mind the hassle of collecting your dropped loot as your trustworthy pet that you chose at the beginning of the game will do it for you.Exciting, isn`t it? BattlestarGalacita: BigPoint is giving the gamers a beautifull 3D graphics game with spaceships that can be customized with a wide variety of weapons. This Sci-Fi game is based on the Emmy award winning TV Series. Enough said I guess. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:24:08.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
