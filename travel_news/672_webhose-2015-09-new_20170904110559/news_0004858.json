Ahead, a group of skinny, Lycra-clad amateur road racers paused for an energy bar outside The Village Bakery in Melmerby.\nI’ll show them, I thought, pulling up unseen behind a clump of trees next to the green, swapping my helmet for a knotted handkerchief and adjusting my threadbare tennis shorts. Now to test the Kalkhoff Tasman Impulse electrically-assisted bike.\nBefore long, on a steep section, I swept past with a cheery wave and then turned to see their surprise (and irritation). I was at the top of the Lake District pass in 17 minutes, just beating the amateur record, and having a pint in the Cumberland Arms in Alston before they had even reached the summit.\nThe Lake District throws up some challenging terrain for thew cyclists among us\nNext Sunday, Team Sky and 19 of the world’s other top cycling teams will be arriving here for Stage Five of the Tour of Britain — our answer to the Tour de France.\nThe eight-stage tour, now in its 70th year, ends at the 2,000ft peak, which rises steeply out of the Cumbrian plain. Not quite Mont Ventoux or the Alpe d’Huez, but a challenge nonetheless. Unless you are cheating.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next An Inspector Calls: A rural retreat in the Durham Dales Dash around dizzying Delhi with the Daily Mail's guide on...

Share this article Share 78 shares Organisers chose this section — which forms part of the famous Sea-to-Sea route, or C2C as it’s known — because it is as beautiful as it is difficult.\nI was cycling the whole of the 140-mile coast-to-coast route over three days, from the Cumbrian port of Whitehaven on the Irish Sea to Tynemouth, where the river Tyne meets the North Sea. Some 25,000 people a year do the C2C, and the first stretch is along an old rail track now converted into a cycleway with commanding views of the Lake District’s northern fells.\nFans will be hoping to get a glimpse of Chris Froome at this year's Tour of Britain, which will take in the sights of the Lake District\nAfter this, quiet country lanes head up, up and away over Whinlatter Pass, before whistling down through the granite bastion of Keswick and onwards (and upwards!) towards Penrith. My first night was at Askham Hall between Ullswater and Penrith, at the end of a 50-mile ride. This 14th‑century castle and erstwhile seat of the Earls of Lonsdale serves some of the finest cuisine in the Lakes. It offers everything you could possibly want after a day in the saddle.\nMy second morning gets off to a bad start. An exploding combine harvester meant the A686 through nearby Langwathby was closed off.\nThe Lake District has been choses as part of the Tour of Britain route as it has some difficult paths\nThis doesn’t happen to the likes of Sir Bradley Wiggins or Chris Froome, I thought. They wouldn’t be forced to replan their route from the Highland Drove Inn in Great Salkeld (though I can think of few better places to do this).\nAfter Hartside and Alston, I powered on to Weardale and the handsome market town of Stanhope along the so-called Roof of England, through old lead mining villages such as Nenthead, St John’s Chapel and Killhope. This really is a wind-blasted wilderness, suffering from some of England’s harshest weather.\nMighty lung-busting heather-clad hills were largely ironed out by my Kalkhoff bike, which whirred on without complaint or battery failure.\nElectric bikes are fast gaining in popularity as they open up huge possibilities to the unfit and those who feel challenged by gradients. And the newer ones hardly look any different from ordinary bikes.\nThe final day starts with possibly the biggest climb of the ride, out of Stanhope, up Crawleyside Bank. I had a light breakfast at the charming Red Lodge guesthouse with Bob, a retired maths teacher from New York, who was also tackling the final stage. He buttered two rounds of toast, smothered them in jam then stuck an omelette in the middle.\nI kept him company for the rest of the ride, some 40 miles. Like many Americans, Bob was a little geographically challenged and worried about where he was heading.\nAfter coffee at Parkhead Station, it was all downhill. Bob fell off and bent the wing mirror protruding from his helmet.\n‘You’ll be OK,’ I told him. ‘We’ll stop at The Hub cycle cafe on Newcastle Quay. I’ll give you a copy of the C2C book so you can see where we went.’\n‘Gee, thanks,’ he said.\nAt the Hub, where trip organisers Saddle Skedaddle are based, Bob went off for refreshments. He returned with two bottles of water and one piece of cake, out of which a lump had been bitten. He opened the two water bottles and took a swig from each.\nWe bowled into Tynemouth just before a deluge and made our farewells.\nBob said he would be coming back to explore the route in more detail and at a more leisurely pace. I hope he does — and, next time, an electric bike might come in handy.\nTRAVEL FACTS Saddle Skedaddle (0191 265 1110, skedaddle.co.uk ) offers coast-to-coast cycle holidays from £385 for four days, including accommodation, transfers, luggage transfers and detailed route notes.\nAskham Hall (01931 712350, askhamhall.co.uk ) has doubles from £150, Red Lodge (01388 526152, redlodgebnb.com ) from £85 and Cumberland Arms (0191 265 1725, thecumberlandarms.co.uk ) from £80.
