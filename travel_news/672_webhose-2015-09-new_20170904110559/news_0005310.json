You’re stuck at your desk and the day seems to be going on forever. Your mind starts to wander — at first to “anywhere but here,” but then to exotic, faraway lands where your everyday problems and stress melt in the presence of true paradise. You want to go to there, and we want to go with you. Every day at 3 p.m. Eastern, we’ll send you a picture of the place we at Yahoo Travel are daydreaming about so we can all take that mental vacation together. Let’s go to… \nPhoto: m01229 /Flickr \n…Cape Cod!!! There are so many great places “down the cape” as the locals say. There is Chatham Bars Inn, a fun and romantic beachfront hotel & resort. There is Race Point Beach, an unspoiled beautiful beach in Provincetown. There is the Wellfleet Aubudon Sanctuary, a lovely place to walk trails and learn about wildlife. And of course, there are all the obvious summer beachy activities to enjoy – swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, volleyball, beach handball, lobster rolls, clam bakes, bonfires…. Right now we are dreaming of making summer last forever. Tumblr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T00:37:31.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
