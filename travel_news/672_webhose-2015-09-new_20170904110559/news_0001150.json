This collaborative and personalised treatment balances The Spa’s menu of services, from relaxing massages and hydrating body treatments to anti-ageing facials and pampering pedicures and manicures.\nThe Spa welcomes Julie Johnson, a world-class acupuncturist and health advisor. For the past 12 years she has been providing premium care to hundreds of clients, addressing a wide spectrum of health concerns. She received her Master of Acupuncture from the Northwest Institute of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in 2003 and has pursued extensive continuing education training including studying with the internationally acclaimed Dr. Richard Tan.\n“People often associate acupuncture with pain management without realising the variety of conditions this medicine can treat. From acute through chronic pain to digestive and immune disease or imbalances, allergies, emotional disorders, insomnia and stress, most people can find some benefit in acupuncture,” says Johnson.\nBecause of its versatility and effectiveness treating a broad spectrum of health concerns, regular, consistent acupuncture can improve overall health and quality of life.\n“People are often surprised that having needles placed in their body can create a state of deep relaxation, usually falling asleep during their treatment only to wake feeling relaxed, balanced and energised,” continues Johnson.\nUnlike a clinical setting, The Spa elevates each acupuncture experience with serene surroundings and amenities, from a eucalyptus steam room with lavender scented towels and hot tea in the relaxation lounge to luxurious rain showers and Four Seasons award-winning service.\nSource:- Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:18:58.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
