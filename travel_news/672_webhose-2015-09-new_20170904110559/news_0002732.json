Shannon was ‘Highly Commended’ from a shortlist of five airports in the ‘Under 4 Million Passengers’ category. It was outright winner of this award last year, having been ‘Highly Commended’ again in 2013. The award was won outright this year by Halifax International Airport in Canada.\nThe global awards, which are voted exclusively by airlines, recognise the marketing and promotional activities of airports and tourism destinations globally. It was a special night in Durban for the Irish, with Tourism Ireland claiming the top award for ‘Destination Marketing’.\nSpeaking following the announcement of the awards in Durban, Declan Power, Head of Aviation Development said that being on this prestigious global awards podium for three years running is a huge achievement for the airport. “We are extremely proud of this award. It says that not alone have we been able to gain top international attention for our efforts to promote our routes at Shannon from the off since separation in 2013 but we are maintaining those very high standards year in year out.”\nCommenting on the significance of the awards for Ireland, Shannon Group Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Murphy said: “It’s a very proud moment, not least given Tourism Ireland’s win outright. They have worked absolute wonders over recent years with imaginative, inclusive marketing of Ireland’s incredible tourism offering.\n“The Wild Atlantic Way initiative, no doubt, influenced the judges greatly. Since its launch in 2014 it has become one of the most talked-about initiatives in global tourism. Shannon is a premier gateway for the Wild Atlantic Way given it is the only airport on the route with services to all of Ireland’s key tourism markets, namely the UK, Europe and the US so we very much share Tourism Ireland’s joy in this win.\n“We have worked to do our part to maximise this fantastic initiative and look forward to building on its remarkable, early success. It is one thing to have a top international initiative like this in place but without air services, particularly directly into the region, its potential would never be reached. The more air access we have available the more tourists will come here because the product is second to none.”\nSource:- Shannon Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:03:11.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
