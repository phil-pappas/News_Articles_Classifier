The Orange Lake Resort holds a weekly Gatorland class/visit with timeshare guests. George Skene, Orlando Sentinel/TNS Published: September 21, 2015 Gator Land's Tim Williams shows guests a real alligator on Aug. 26, 2015 in Kissimmee, Fla. George Skene, Orlando Sentinel/TNS \nORLANDO, Fla. (Tribune News Service) — The dingy khaki bag on the floor of the Clementine room at the Orange Lake Resort doesn’t exactly blend in with the room’s patterned carpet and royal blue chairs. \nAnd when the bag moves? It stands out even more. \n“This animal’s not a pet,” Gatorland’s Tim Williams said of the 4-foot alligator that was held inside. “I want the kids to understand that.” \nCentral Florida’s bevy of attractions are enough to overwhelm any tourist planning a trip here. Gatorland is among a handful of animal-oriented attractions that bring part of their attraction to tourists staying in area resorts. \nWild Florida offers a similar program with Gator Hugs. The program allows clients, including several Central Florida hotels, to choose from an alligator, bird, snake or any other animal from the Wildlife Park at the Kenansville attraction. Fees for the program, which started in 2013, start at $300 and vary depending on the animal requested. \nWilliams said Gatorland officials track discounted tickets and vouchers they give to area resorts and hotels to see what shows resulted in increased traffic at the park and where the guests came from. \nLeading a bulk of the off-site programs, Williams said he sees “a good return” first-hand — walking through Gatorland, visitors will recognize him, stop him and thank him for coming to their resort. \n“It’s great exposure,” he said. \nOrlando Medieval Times, a dinner show, also has a traveling pet show — usually with a 4-year-old falcon named Myla. \nTony Amodt and Myla make routine stops at conventions, trade shows and I-Drive area attractions. \n“She’s ridden the train around Fun Spot,” Amodt said. \nMyla also has made an appearance at the Orlando Science Center, posing for photos in the mouth of the T-Rex. \n“We do a little bit of everything,” said Amodt. “I’ve even done hotel breakfasts.” \nThey have 28 events planned for Amodt and the attraction’s falcons this month. \nMedieval Times doesn’t closely track how their outside appearances help business, said Matt Tuchman, the attraction’s marketing and sales manager. \nMyla, who participates in a majority of the dinner theater’s shows, doesn’t have to do much to draw a crowd and gets ooh’s and ahh’s of passersby when on display. Amodt, who’s worked at Medieval Times for 15 years, has spent nine years training the attraction’s birds. \n“It’s not something you see every day,” he said. “People love asking questions and I love answering them. … I’ve talked to people for 30 minutes with the bird.” \nAttractions are glad to promote themselves and stand out in a crowded tourism region. \nTuchman said Amodt and Myla go out as much as possible. Typically there’s no charge for appearances. \nGatorland also makes weekly appearances at Marriott’s Grande Vista on International Drive and gator feedings at Gaylord Palms, which has some of the attraction’s gators living on site, said Williams. \nThe weekly Gatorland show at the Holiday Inn Club Vacations Orange Lake Resort costs guests $5, which reflects the cost to staff the event and transport the alligators. \nHaving run for 12 years and consistently drawing a large crowd, the show drew 109 people late last month. It educates resort guests about alligator safety because gators live on the property. It’s grown from only about a dozen people attending its first class years ago, said Williams, Gatorland’s director of media production — who held the young gator in his arms like it’s a tiny lap dog. \nNow, the class draws hundreds of people each week. \n“The room’s always full and kids are always having a great time. It’s a unique adventure,” said Eric Holland, director of resort activities for Orange Lake. “What’s more Florida than actually being able to hold a gator in your hand and take (a photo) home to show your friends?” \nAnd resort employees such as Holland, tasked with offering free or affordable entertainment choices for guests, also see the value. \n“It’s a win every time,” said Holland. \n©2015 The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Fla.)
