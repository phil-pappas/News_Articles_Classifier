The project has seen the 5-star attraction transform with the reinstatement of doorways on the Royal Mile, creating an on-street presence, a new welcome and exhibition area as well as the creation of an internal 40-seat café, The Royal Exchange Coffee House. Juliana Delaney, Chief Executive of Continuum Attractions commented: “It’s been a pleasure to welcome partners from the City Council and colleagues from the industry this evening to mark a new quality level of guest service for The Real Mary King’s Close. We are pleased to have the continued support of the City of Edinburgh Council; delivering their original goal of adding yet another world class attraction to the portfolio and a revenue stream.” Guests gathered to enjoy canapés freshly made by the attraction’s new café team whilst soaking up the atmosphere of the historic former Burgh Courtroom. This will also function as an event space. The Real Mary King’s Close is operated by Continuum Attractions.
