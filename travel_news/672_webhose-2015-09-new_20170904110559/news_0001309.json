Recognising the significance of the online experience for visitors planning their journey, meeting colleagues or reviewing eating and entertainment options, is an important part of managing a successful venue and delivering great event experiences. \nThe new website was launched to coincide with ESC (European Society of Cardiology) 2015, London’s biggest ever medical congress which attracted a record audience, most of whom were first time visitors to ExCeL London. The launch of the new site also sees the introduction of the dot London domain name, designed to further cement ExCeL’s reputation as the capital’s leading exhibition and convention centre. As David Pegler, CEO, ExCeL London, explains: “At ExCeL London, we are committed to working with our clients to help them deliver fantastic event outcomes. Our new website is easy to navigate and view on a mobile or tablet, so visitors can easily review everything from the best way to get to ExCeL, our food and drink options or how to stay connected, whilst they are on the move. We believe our new website will encourage more people who have registered for an event at ExCeL to attend, which supports our clients’ ambition to grow their audience and our vision to be the home of world leading events.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:32:50.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
