Italian Regional Map \nItalian Regional Map Â© James Martin, licensed to About.com Regions for Food Lovers \nTuscany is the classic region for una Fiorentina , the Florentine T-Bone from Chianina beef cooked over a hardwood fire. There's also lots of seafood along the Tuscan Coast, but Puglia has always been the place to sit down and eat nothing but the small plates from the sea, followed up by a grilled fish if you're still hungry. Piemonte has great wine and over 160 cheeses, and is Italy's herb producer. The Emilia Romagna is the place for meat, perhaps some tagliatelle Bolognese from the region's food capital Bologna, followed by a bollito misto. The Italian islands are also great for fish, but Sardinia is very much a meat-eater's dream. Try the spit roasted suckling pig maialino, and any lamb dishes you might come across \nItaly's northern regions prefer butter, while the center and south have relied on olive oil to cook and flavor food. Brilliantly Baroque \nLots of travelers like the Renaissance art and architecture of Tuscany, but the Renaissance didn't reach the south of Italy. Instead, the compelling regions for the expression of the Baroque are Puglia and Sicily. Lecce is singled out as a Baroque city. The region of Puglia is also singled out as being one of the flatter regions of Italy, so biking, for those of us who don't relish long hill climbs, is a great activity to plan for the heel of Italy's boot.
