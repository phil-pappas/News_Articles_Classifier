Further highlights of the presentation will be a culinary demonstration and a discussion on \"The Importance of the Spawning Season.\" \nGiven that online retailers have become an important sales channel for the import of high-end seafood into China, another feature at the event will be a dedicated presentation on \"E-commerce in China: Development and Opportunities.\" Presented by Yiguo E-Commerce, the session will share how international fish and shellfish suppliers can utilize online platforms to market their products to the Chinese market. \nTo further emphasize the importance of the mainland China market to the sector, there will also be a special focus on \"Future Cold Chain Development in China,\" delivered by Swire Pacific Cold Storage. \nClosing this year's event program is American company Arctic Circle Wild Salmon whose chef will demonstrate preparation techniques while explaining how to bring excitement to the menu. \n\"In order to maximize the networking experience for delegates, Seafood Expo Asia 2015 also sees the introduction of a new, online business matchmaking program,\" says Seafood Expo Asia, Show Director, Ms. Terri Tsang. \"Designed to encourage and increase efficiencies in sourcing products during the exhibition, buyers and importers have been invited to use this service to initiate and arrange business meetings with exhibitors of interest.\" \nSeafood Expo Asia's online business matchmaking compliments other initiatives at the exposition, including a networking event, featuring seafood hors d'oeuvres and wine that is open to all visitors and exhibitors and will be held on the first day of the event from 16.30 to 18.00 on Tuesday 8th September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T03:03:12.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
