The ACJ319neo will fly eight passengers up to 6,750 nm/12,500 km or more than 15 hours, while the ACJ320neo will transport 25 passengers up to 6,000 nm/11, 100 km or more than 13 hours.\n“Airbus corporate jets deliver many benefits that traditional bizjets often lack, such as modern fly-by-wire controls, larger diameter more-efficient engines, and the ability to land automatically in mist and fog ,” says Airbus COO Customers, John Leahy. “Add the widest and tallest cabins of any business jet, while being similar in size externally, and you can see why Airbus corporate jets are such great lifestyle-enablers,” he adds.\nAirbus has always had a culture of innovation, which keeps its aircraft family the most modern in the world. Fuel-saving Sharklets and engines, standard on the ACJ320neo Family, are the latest examples, with Airbus being unique in deriving the full benefit of these.\nMore than 170 Airbus corporate jets are in service around the world, benefitting from an around the clock, around the world network that serves more than 500 customers and operators – as well as services tailored to their needs. They are flying on every continent, including Antarctica.\nSource:- Airbus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:09:54.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
