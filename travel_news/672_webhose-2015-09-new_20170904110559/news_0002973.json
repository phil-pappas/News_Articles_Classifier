As one TripAdvisor® reviewer put it:\n“Most kid friendly Hotel Ever”\n“I loved staying in the Bamboo Beach Club! I went with a girl friend of mine and our 4 kids. (They) graciously rearranged our rooms, so we would have adjoining rooms upstairs. We all had a BLAST! (They are) so kind. The hotel was clean. The pool was so fun and was kept nice and clean. The location is incredible. I'm so grateful that we chose to stay here for our trip. I was worried about having our kids all together, but the Bamboo Beach Club was so kid friendly. It made staying there stress free! Thank you!!!“\nAccording to Dave Dawson, Vice President, Acquisitions and Development of Global Connections, “We provide both whole resort and individually owned vacation condo property management.
