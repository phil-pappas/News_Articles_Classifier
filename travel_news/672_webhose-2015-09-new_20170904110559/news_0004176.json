The Coffee vs Gangs project in Honduras seems to provide irrefutable proof that, given the right support and skills, you can light an entrepreneurial fire inside anyone. When Enrique first joined the project, he was frightened by the scale of the tasks in front of him: to learn about the land, and understand how to grow high quality coffee; to brush up on his English, Spanish and maths skills; to write a business plan, when he’d left school as a young teenager and had never seen such a document in his life. Fast-forward almost a year and Enrique is nearing the end of the programme and the 28-year-old has not only risen to the challenge, he has exceeded all expectations. Presentation skills: One of Enrique's ambitions is to grow cocoa What started as a simple aim – to grow coffee – has blossomed into an ambitious venture, spanning coffee, a fish farm, a multitude of vegetables and even cocoa. Armed with simple tools, such as an understanding of profit and loss, Enrique is truly thinking like an entrepreneur. “I go with my wife to the market to see what products are missing, or what is expensive during a certain period,” he explains. This information informs his next crop.“I hear people talking about what products they can buy and which ones they can’t. I observe the market and everything I hear is useful information.” Maybe I will plant fruit trees, and something bigger like pineapples. I must harness all the potential in the land I have The mainstay of Enrique’s business remains coffee. “That is my priority and my passion,” he says – but every penny he makes is reinvested into the development of a diversified business model. During the four to five month period that the coffee is growing and maturing on Enrique’s farm, he will grow vegetables to ensure a steady flow of revenue into his fledgling business. “We will grow many vegetables like cucumbers, onion, sweet chilli and radishes,” he says. “We have already twice harvested a crop of onions and sweet chilli, which is extremely popular.” Enrique’s ambitions were once modest, but now know no bounds. “Another plan I have is to grow cocoa,” he says. “People come from Switzerland to Honduras to buy cocoa for chocolate and ice creams. There is a big demand so I shall grow it. Planting the seed: students have learned tools to help them throughout their lives “Maybe I will plant fruit trees, and something bigger like pineapples. I must harness all the potential in the land I have.” Enrique isn’t the only student to have flourished. Maria too feels that she has grown with the project. “I’m not just using what I have learned in my business,” she says. “The tools I have learned will help me throughout my whole life.” Louis says that Coffee vs Gangs has given him a taste for knowledge. “I want to keep studying, I am thinking of taking a technical degree alongside my business,” he says. “In my life now, I am always learning, both in the classroom and outside it,” says Enrique. “I stopped my formal education many years ago but now I am back, learning so many things, and it makes me so happy.” • To discover more about the Coffee vs Gangs project and read about gang culture in Honduras, visit telegraph.co.uk/coffeevsgangs You may also be interested in: • Video: Visiting the Coffee vs Gangs farm • The Honduras coffee region by numbers • Coffee production: from seedling to coffee cup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:22:31.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
