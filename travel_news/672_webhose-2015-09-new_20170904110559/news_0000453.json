Meanwhile some 2,200 Local 357 pilots who work for Indianapolis, Ind.-based Republic Airways (NASDAQ: RJET) are studying a detailed four-page document from the seven-member Local 357 executive board sent out late Friday. The document explains why the board decided not to send out for a rank and file vote the proposed last, best and final contract offer that Republic presented to the union on Aug. 20. The four-page document notes many aspects of the contract that the Local 357 executive board found to be of concern. According to Clark in a interview today, many of the issues have to do with contract wording that Clark says Republic changed without it being signed off on by union negotiators prior to being presented in the last, best and final offer Republic unveiled on Aug. 20. In an interview today, Local 357 president Jim Clark said the executive board's vote is not necessarily the final say on the matter of the proposed contract, however. The Local still is waiting to hear from national leaders of the IBT on whether they think Republic's proposed contract should be voted on by Local 357 rank and file. The national IBT has the power to overrule the Local 357 exec board decision. Clark could not say when national IBT leaders might issue a ruling on the proposed last, best and final contract offer. On another front, pilots who belong to Local 357 says details in Republic's second quarter 2015 financial report are being looked at more closely as the standoff with management continues. The largest number of Republic pilots, 350, are domiciled in Chicago. Of particular interest to some pilots is a line in the financial report simply labeled \"other\" expenses, which ballooned to $47.7 million in the second quarter of 2015 from $36.6 million a year ago — a much bigger increase than occurred for any other line item expense in the second quarter report. A Republic Airways spokesman did not return a phone call or email seeking comment. But Republic Airways management has begun suggesting in some of its public comments that the airline could be forced into bankruptcy if it does not get a new deal soon with its pilots, who have been negotiating a new contract for eight years. Clark today said Local 357 already has prepared a comprehensive counter-proposal to the last, best and final offer Republic Airways management presented earlier this month. But that counter-proposal is in the hands of the national IBT, Clark said, and cannot be sent to Republic management until management signals it will return to the bargaining table. As of Monday morning, Republic had given no such signal, Clark said. \nGet Chicago  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T03:31:34.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
