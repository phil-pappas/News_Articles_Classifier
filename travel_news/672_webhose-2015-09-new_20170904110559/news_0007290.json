The company will also be holding extensive meetings with existing and potential clients from the global electronics, ICT and other sectors affected by supply chain due diligence issues.\nMartello Risk's in-depth and proven on-site auditing expertise gives assurance across mineral supply chains and the company is one of just four independent auditors accredited by the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR). Martello Risk uses its extensive, accumulated knowledge and experience to uncover the hard facts about mineral supplies and provide the necessary evidence and documentation that are needed to ensure manufacturing companies meet their regulatory and CSR obligations.\nMartello Risk believes that standard audits of supply chains are inadequate given the remoteness and instability of regions in which gold, tungsten, tantalum and tin are often mined. The company also firmly believes there is no substitute for rigorous on-the-ground auditing of mines, smelters, brokers and wholesalers - undertaken on a regular basis and reviewed during periods of conflict.\nResponsible companies must follow OECD guidance about due diligence of mineral supply chains that trace back to conflict-affected and high-risk areas. In addition, US companies and their suppliers need independent evidence of the integrity of supply chains that involve DR Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements are laid down in Section 1502 of the US Dodd-Frank Act.\nMartello Risk provides clarity across supply chains by conducting audits that accurately establish the provenance of minerals and their conflict status. Specifically, this includes: 'know your supplier/customer' assessments; independent third-party audits of supply chains which trace back to the Great Lakes Region of Central Africa for annual SEC filings; political risk assessments which monitor complex situations and potential threats; and in-depth expertise with regard to the international diamond trade and the Kimberley Process.\nMartello Risk also conducts in-depth research tailored to answer specific questions raised by our clients in order to provide them with strategic advice on critical issues. We do this using a global network which enjoys access to experts and key decision makers. The information gathered from this network is corroborated, analysed and assimilated in-house and is then crafted into accurate and confidential assessments for corporations, regulatory bodies and financial institutions.\nFor further information, or if you would like to meet a member of the team from 21 st September to 8 th October 2015 , please contact Martello Risk via Email: info@martellorisk.com , or call +44(0)207-193-4439.\nhttp://www.martellorisk.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201509179872&Transmission_Id=201509171735PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201509179872&DateId=20150917", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T02:04:38.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
