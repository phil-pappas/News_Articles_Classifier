Getting from Naples to Siracusa takes about 9-10 hours on the train. It will take more time that you think to travel in Sicily on the train, as trains, even along the main lines from Palermo to Siracusa, are notably slow. \nWithin Sicily, either the SAIS Aurolinee bus or the railroad gets you from Catania to Palermo in 2 hours and 24 minutes, for example. It's just a little longer from Messina to Palermo by rail. Take the train down the coast from Messina to Siracusa by train takes 2 hours 42 minutes. Messina to Agrigento takes 4 hours and 35 minutes on the train. Click the links to see the current cost of these journeys. Sicily by Car \nThe best way to see Sicily (especially if you don't have a lot of time) is to travel by car. Cars can be rented at airports and downtown locations in major cities. There is a 14% tax added when you rent at the airport. The three largest rental services in Sicily are Hertz, Avis, and Maggiore. All have presences at Aeroporto Fontanarossa in Catania. \nThe aurostrade (toll roads) are well maintained in Sicily. You will probably want to avoid driving in large cities, but the regional roads are good and scenic views present themselves often. Sicily by Train \nAlthough the Main lines connecting Messina, Taormina, Siracusa, and Palermo are relatively brisk, the secondary lines, shown on the map as thin lines, are generally quite slow. The Messina-Palermo run is quite scenic. I recommend a stop in Cefalu ( pictures ). I have never minded the slowness. It gives you time to see the landscape. You can also take the train to Agrigento to see the temples (pictures) . \nBus services between the smaller cities is available from a number of carriers offering air-conditioned buses at prices slightly higher than the train. The main bus company is AST , which provides buses between most major cities. Sicily and Surrounding Islands by Ferry \nFerries service Sicily extensively. You can get to Sicily from Genoa, Naples, Cagliani Sardinia, Malta and Tunisia via ferry, as well as the Sicilian Island groups of Egadi, Lipari, and Eolie, and islands of Pantelleria, Lampadusa, and Linosa. See Ferries to Sicily for Sicily Ferry information. Sicily Airports \nCatania-Fontanarossa Airport (CTA/LICC) serves the east of Sicily, and while the west is served by Palermo International .

Island hopping on the Aeolian Islands (Isole Eolia). Flower Lovers see the Infiorata de Noto at the end of May, one of many Italian Infiorata festivals . Where to Stay in Sicily \nSince Sicily really isn't about the cities, a rural stay with a view of the sea or of Mount Etna (or both!) would be my way to travel. HomeAway lists over 1400 vacation properties in Sicily, rural and in cities like Palermo and my favorite, Ragusa.

Sicilian Tours \nSicily is known for its cuisine, so you might want to take a cooking class to learn about it. Select Italy offers a class at the Cucina del Sole cooking school which is the home of chef Eleonora Consoli in Viagrande (just off the slopes of Mt. Etna near Catania) and lasts 3 hours.
