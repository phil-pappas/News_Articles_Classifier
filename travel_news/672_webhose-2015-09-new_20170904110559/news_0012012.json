A shallow draft of less than 6 feet (1.75 meters) also makes Dynamiq yachts 'Bahamas friendly' and gives much more cruising freedom. The Dynamiq GTT is available in three base models: - the D4 base model, 127ft / 38.6m, 2o knots, starts at EUR13,900,000 - the S4 sport version, 127ft / 38.6m, 25 knots, starts at EUR15,500,00 - and the D4 L limousine version 132ft / 40m, 20 knots, starts at EUR14,750,000 All three models are built in aluminum, to the highest standards of comfort, safety and emission control.

In 2014 the keel of \"Jetsetter\" the first Dynamiq D4 yacht was laid at NCA shipyard in Carrara, Italy.
