However, the cumulative trade deficit for the first nine months of the year came in at R36.27bn, compared with the R69.94bn for the same period last year, and so put a brake on rand losses.\nThe ADP employment report in the US for September showed private payroll growth of 200,000 on the month, slightly above consensus expectations (190,000) and broadly in line with recent trends.\nThe data could be viewed as supportive of a US rate hike this year, which would have a negative effect on emerging markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:37:46.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
