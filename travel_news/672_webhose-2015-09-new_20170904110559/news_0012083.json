Nobody can stop this (NDA’s) victory march irrespective of how many parties and leaders come together against us.\n“Two days back there was a sacrificial meeting in Gandhi Maidan in which JP, Lohia and Karpuri Thakur were sacrificed. Lohia fought against Congress but his disciples have now betrayed him for their lust for power. They have joined hands with those (Congress) who put JP in jail,” Modi said, asking people to “sacrifice” such people by voting them out.\nModi, facing sustained criticism by Kumar and Lalu for his DNA dig at the Bihar Chief Minister, lavished praise on the people of the state, saying the “most intelligent people live in Bihar”.\nThe Prime Minister, who had earlier announced a Rs 1.25 lakh crore package for the state, referred to Kumar’s sop of Rs 2.7 lakh crore, and claimed that the Bihar Chief Minister was forced to do so after he made development a major poll plank.\n“They ridiculed my package but realised in two-three days that people have seen through their game. So they were forced to announce their own development package. I am very happy that development has become a poll issue in Bihar,” he said.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 3:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:06:53.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
