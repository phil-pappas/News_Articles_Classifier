This includes Best Western International Asia, CHM Hotels, FRHI Hotels & Resorts, Furama Hotels International, Hyatt Hotels & Resorts, HPL Hotels & Resorts, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Movenpick Hotels & Resorts, Park Hotel Group, Premier Inn Hotel, Sol Melia, Starwood Asia Pacific Hotels & Resorts, and global room distribution portal, Hotelbeds. \n\nShirlena Tan, regional director of sales & marketing, Furama Hotels International shared why ATF is the platform to showcase the Furama brand to buyers. Tan said: “As the event delivers buyers that reach both discerning business and leisure travellers, we are able to present Furama, FuramaXclusive and FX Hotels as excellent choices for their consideration.” \n\nThe annual industry event that houses the largest collection of travel trade suppliers from across the 10 member ASEAN nations has also announced that exhibition floor space is quickly filling up, with close to 70 per cent of booths already secured by hotels, resorts, airlines, tour operators, themed attractions, tourism boards and other service providers. \n\nMelia Hotels International believes ATF strengthens their position in South-east Asia. Ruben Cases, senior director of sales & marketing Asia Pacific said: “With 20 years of established presence in the region, ATF offers us the opportunity to reinforce alliances, negotiate strategic agreements and meet new players.” \n\nLike the independent exhibitors from across the region, brands are also seeing the value of having a corporate presence at the show. The unparalleled reach to 400 validated, qualified global buyers and 100 international and local media during the three-day event is undoubtedly the biggest draw factor. In addition, corporate brands also cite valuable business generation prospects, product profiling, awareness and lead generation as must-attend reasons. \n\nLindawati Muhlis, head of sales & marketing Indonesia of Premier Inn South East Asia agreed: “In addition to regional inbound sales, our presence at ATF also increases market awareness for our brand across ASEAN and beyond.” \n\nFor more information on booth space, email atfsellers@ttgasia.com or visit www.atfphilippines.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T09:20:28.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
