Dumoulin (Giant-Alpecin) clocked 46 minutes 1 second in the 38.7-kilometre test against the clock to win by 1min 4secs from Maciej Bodnar (Tinkoff-Saxo), with Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) four seconds further back. The more significant movement was in the general classification, where Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha), the red jersey incumbent, conceded more than three minutes to Dumoulin. Fabio Aru (Astana) showed great determination to stay within three seconds of Dumoulin despite conceding 1min 53secs on the stage. Italian Aru was 10th on the stage in 47min 54sec and Spaniard Rodríguez was 30th in 49min 7sec. With no summit finishes remaining until Sunday's concluding stage to Madrid, it remains to be seen if Aru can wrestle the red jersey from Dumoulin. A fascinating conclusion to the race is in prospect as Dumoulin seeks a momentous moment for Dutch cycling. It is 35 years since a Dutchman won a grand tour, when Joop Zoetemelk won the 1980 Tour de France. He also won the 1979 Vuelta.
