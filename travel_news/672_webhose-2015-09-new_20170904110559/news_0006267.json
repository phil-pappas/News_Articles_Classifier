Guests are encouraged to register early to guarantee a spot at a spectacular Halloween Bash with the Holiday Inn Westbury. The Hotel's Corporate Sales Manager, Steff Marrero has put this event together, and Halloween happens to be one of her favorite holidays, so guests can be sure they'll be in for a scary treat. In regards to Halloween, Steff said, \"I love Halloween because people get to escape from reality for a bit. They can be something, or even somebody they are not ordinarily, and just have a good time doing so. It's great to see how creative people can be, and seeing people play out a role in costume is very similar to the art of acting, which is something I am very interested in. Halloween falling on a Saturday night to me just ads to the entire day, and especially the evening. I am not only putting the event together, I am going to be a part of it.\"\nFor additional information, guests may contact Steff direct at the Hotel via phone at 516-213-9102. Steff can also be e-mailed at smarrero(at)hiwestbury(dot)com. For special discounts on overnight accommodations, guests must reserve their rooms directly with Steff. The special discounted rate for a room is $149.00 for two guests, and $169.00 for a room and breakfast vouchers for two.\nHalloween party attendees and hotel guests must be 21 years of age and older.
