If you become an Associate Member before October 15, 2015, you will receive a free copy of the Festival programme book. More about Glyndebourne Associate Membership: Glyndebourne Associate Membership allows you to enjoy priority booking for the 2016 Festival. Next year’s season features entertaining and moving operas including: Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia Janáček's The Cunning Little Vixen Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro Berlioz's Béatrice et Bénédict Britten's A Midsummer Night’s Dream About the festival: Opera may be famed for its tragic tales of love and death but the 2016 Glyndebourne Festival will present a line-up of six comedic operas, each underpinned with emotional depth, to leave audiences both entertained and moved. The Festival opens on 21 May with the return of David McVicar’s acclaimed 2011 production of Wagner’s only mature comedy, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. A landmark in the company’s performance history, this production is likely to be very popular. This is followed by a new production of Rossini’s Il barbiere di Siviglia, a mainstay of the operatic repertory which has not been seen at Glyndebourne since 1994. In the 400th anniversary year of the death of William Shakespeare, Festival 2016 will present two operas based on his work: Berlioz’s Béatrice et Bénédict, adapted from Much Ado About Nothing, and Benjamin Britten’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. In addition, Michael Grandage’s popular 2012 production of Mozart’s comic gem Le nozze di Figaro returns to the Glyndebourne Festival and the line-up is completed by a revival of Melly Still’s 2012 colourful production of Janáček’s The Cunning Little Vixen, possibly the only opera to be derived from a newspaper cartoon strip.
