Bracamonte\nSeptember 20, 2015 (updated) Courtesy of cebupacificairlines.ph\nPhilippine low-cost carrier Cebu Pacific was included in Asia361.com ’s listing of airlines with the best-looking flight crew. The random list of 11 Asian and two European air conveyances placed Abu Dhabi’s Emirates Airlines at the top for receiving the most number of votes in a casual poll.\nAsia 361 is a Singapore-based online lifestyle publication targeting Asian trendsetters.\nMid-Eastern carriers dominated the list which included Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and Dubai-based Afghan-owned Safi Airways. The other Asian planes mentioned were China Eastern Airlines, Taiwan’s EVA Air, South Korea’s Asiana Airlines, Japan’s All Nippon Airways, and Garuda Indonesia. Completing the roster were European air transport vessels Lufthansa of Germany and Virgin Atlantic of England.\nVietjet Air’s bikini show featuring dancers and/or models for their promotional campaigns was included in a special mention (bonus) at the end of the list. Its bikini show of local pageant contenders celebrated the airline’s new route between Ho Chi Minh and Nha Trang.\nThe listing was made in reaction to the 2014 guidelines issued by the Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation that mandated overweight cabin crew members to lose excess pounds in three months time or be deemed unfit for duty for half a year.\nFit male crew members are supposed to have a body mass index of 18 to 25 while their distaff counterparts must be within the 18 to 22 range.\nCebu Pacific claims to have the youngest fleet plying both local and international destinations. In 2010, the airline created a buzz on social media when its flight attendants burst into a dance while demonstrating the flight safety procedure.\nCourtesy of wingco1129 via Youtube", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lqh8e2KYIrU", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgnI38El1nb-m39jH6yzc4w", "http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T03:58:20.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
