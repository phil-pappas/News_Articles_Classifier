However, we must remind ourselves that politicians are elected on their perceived ability to improve the country’s wellbeing, as well as playing a good global game. The unsensational matter of education grabs little air time, but we should all pay attention. A lot has been said – and spent – on education, but the UK system is in crisis. The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission recently published a detailed report describing the existence of a “class ceiling” . Its main thrust is that the top jobs go to the best educated, a function of class. Worryingly, it noted that Britain faces a permanent social divide if the “class ceiling” is not addressed. National disregard for education was borne out by its low ranking in pre-election polls. Our results are disappointing, too. In 2014, a CBI report noted that 36.4pc of pupils failed to achieve a C grade in GCSE English; a worrying 42pc failed to gain a C grade in maths. There is a 10 to 15-year lead time on these results, which dates them to the Blair administration. ?Education, education, education? was Tony Blair's mantra Photo: Andrew Crowley/The Telegraph “Education, education, education” was the Blair mantra and no one can question the levels of expenditure during his tenure. What is in question is whether taxpayers’ money was spent intelligently. OECD data from 2010 confirm that UK educational spend exceeded the international average (6.5pc versus 6.3pc as a proportion of GDP). Tests in 2012 ranked the UK’s performance well below its Asian and European peers in core subjects (reading, maths and science). Blair talked a lot and spent a lot of money, but failed to design an effective educational inheritance. He debased the system by lowering standards at every stage. There is societal cause and effect too. General malaise for education stirs among disenfranchised young people who have little desire for self-improvement. The rot started in the 1970s. The idea of a fully comprehensive system looked good on paper, but in terms of social mobility and education standards the result has been extremely disappointing. Ever increasing standards in the private sector are mirrored by the stagnation of the state sector. Wealthier parents can bypass the school lottery by opting for the private sector or higher house prices near a good comprehensive or surviving grammar school. Outstanding results attract good pupils and teachers. Private sector education is a good example of the power of competition in a free market where consumers can exercise choice. The grammar schools had their faults but as a mechanism for real social mobility they were superb. I went to school with bright children from all sectors of society where no parent could buy their way in. True meritocracy. Shirley Williams was privately educated at St Paul's Photo: Google Nobody has given me an explanation as to why the destruction of the grammar schools was carried out predominantly by politicians educated in the private sector. Shirley Williams (St Paul’s) and Anthony Crosland (Highgate) led the vandalism. Before retiring to her bed at night, I would like the now Baroness Williams to reflect on the way she blighted the future of thousands of working class boys and girls. She ought not to sleep that well. These boys and girls would now be occupying top positions in all walks of life that are now predominantly occupied by those educated in the private sector. This is not just anecdotal; the distribution of medals won by the British team in the London Olympics was not at all representative of the population . A prime example of inequality in our society. These politicians were deluded into thinking there would be a levelling up, but the reverse was the case. Worryingly, business leaders talk of a confidence deficit in skilled workers in the UK. Companies will employ better trained migrant workers, leaving a core of the population with diminished aspirations. We risk enforcing a ghetto culture without redesigning an education system to lift people out of poverty and give them hope. Michael Gove took on the unions as education secretary Photo: PA The system needs an overhaul. Change is fraught with confrontations with unions, as former education secretary Michael Gove discovered. To increase pride and buy into education, the quality of the system needs to be improved. It is therefore heartening to see that Nicky Morgan’s proposed reforms are based on what she calls social justice and an understanding that all children should have access to a more meritocratic society. To start, from 2017 the pass threshold for GCSEs will increase by a third. All pupils – not just those in private schools – will have to study the English Baccalaureate subjects at GCSE. Poor discipline is being addressed by use of former bouncers in classrooms. There is an irony here: we enjoy far higher standards of living than ever with apparently greater equalities and opportunities for all. Yet this schism in society feels Victorian. Children need to be able to flourish in a system that will enrich them and Britain in every sense. Social mobility through effective education could iron out the equality and aspiration issues that Labour is still debating. The Tories need to shed their elitist image and move closer towards what Conservatives should stand for – opportunity for all. David Cameron must resist being distracted by the limelight of the European stage and take brave decisions to reform education, although the credit may take a generation to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T14:37:42.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
