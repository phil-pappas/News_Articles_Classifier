Specifics on the promotion were announced to travel media and trade professionals during an experiential event in Toronto on Tues., Sept. 29.The discounts being offered at least cover the difference of the 76-cent-on-the-dollar conversion of Canadian to U.S. dollars, making the two equal. At some hotels, however, accommodations will be offered at as much as a 65 percent discount off regular season rates for Canadians. The Myrtle Beach area hopes these discounts will ease travelers’ anxiety about the loonie’s decline and ensure they can get away in the early part of 2016.\n \n“We have been welcoming Canadians to the Myrtle Beach area for decades and hope this promotional solution will help overcome any financial hurdles caused by the exchange rate,” said Susan Phillips, director of marketing for the Myrtle Beach Area CVB. “This special Canadian discount is just one more reason to visit in the lovely late winter and early spring seasons, which have typically mild weather, even more affordable accommodations and more elbow room at area attractions.”\n \nIn addition to Canadian discounts from January through April, the 55th annual Canadian-American Days Festival, or Can-Am Days, will also take place during this discount window, from March 12-20, 2016. In commemoration of this milestone anniversary, a number of special activities and events are planned to showcase the Myrtle Beach area’s Southern hospitality.\n \nSource:-Myrtle Beach", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:47:06.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
