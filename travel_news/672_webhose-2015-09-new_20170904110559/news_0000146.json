Or at arrivals, without a single taxi to be found. Such travails are commonplace when travelling, but when you are on business , every delay carries with it a little more stress. Thankfully, help is at hand. Here are the apps that can help you to your destination without breaking a sweat. For managing time and money Do Button , from IFTTT (“If This Then That”) is an ingenious app that enables users to create their own custom-made functions for a whole range of tasks and execute them with a single tap. For instance, it can be programmed to file completed expense reports to the relevant person, send a particular message to a pre-defined group of people or block out the next 15 minutes in your diary. Keeping track of expenses can also be made relatively painless by Expensify , an app that allows you to document claims just by taking pictures of receipts. It’s able to record mileage – either using GPS or pictures of a car’s odometer – and can also keep track of hours worked. (Both free; App Store, Google Play.) For high-risk destinations Created to “give people fast access to life-saving information”, Safeture was previously only available to corporate clients (security contractor G4S and insurance providers ERV are among the companies to have equipped their employees with it) but can now be downloaded for free by anyone. The app pulls data from governments as well as meteorological agencies and seismology institutes to provide real-time information about local health alerts, severe weather warnings and civil unrest. It also includes functions to connect with emergency response teams and send accurate location data to friends, family or colleagues. (Free to download, but coverage is $3.99 for two weeks, or $21.99 for a year; App Store, Google Play) For connectivity Wi-Fi Finder allows you to avoid excessive data charges and slow mobile connections when on the move by scanning for the closest Wi-Fi hotspots, showing where they are and filtering more than 650,000 results across 144 countries according to network provider and whether they are free or pay-to-use. Another option, although it comes at a price, is iPass . It claims to be the world’s largest Wi-Fi network, with around 50 million hotspots worldwide. There’s no need to type in details each time you log in, and accounts that provide unlimited use start from $39 per month. (Free; App Store, Google Play) For managing bookings The world’s highest-rated travel organising app, Trip It (free; App Store, Google Play), boasts 11m users. It creates a shareable master itinerary from various confirmation emails – hotels, airlines, car hire and other travel – and provides access to it from any device. The British Airways app (Free; App Store, Google Play, Amazon Appstore, BlackBerry World) can be used to book flights, check in, and choose a seat, and provides information about gates, departure times and Wi-Fi codes. Users with an Apple watch can also view real-time notifications on their wrist. What’s more, the app can be used to track your Executive Club status, functions as a boarding pass, and allows you to manage Avios on the go. For navigating Using clever algorithms to establish the best route from A to B, across all different types of transport, Citymapper (free; App Store, Google Play) is hardly a well-kept secret. But not everyone will know that the app, which is backed by M&C Saatchi, is live in 28 cities around the world – and counting. For business trips that involve driving, satnav app CoPilot Premium (£34.99 for the Europe version; App Store, Google Play) may be a better bet. It tracks your position using GPS, and stores maps offline, so you can find your way even without an internet connection. Just remember to keep your eyes on the road. • Find out more about how to receive business travel rewards by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T13:38:49.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
