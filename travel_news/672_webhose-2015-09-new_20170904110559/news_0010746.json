Boats range in size from kayaks and canoes to mega-yachts and fishing vessels.\nWhat’s hot: The number of choices is terrific. But the feature that will get me to keep the app on my phone is the filter. Click on filter and choose the type of boat that suits your mood: power, sail, fishing, non-powered or mega-yacht. You can also request a captain or no captain. If you’re looking for a vessel to fit your budget or with a large capacity, it has those options too.\nWhat’s not: My search results were inconsistent when I was testing the iPhone app and the website. The app turned up significantly more search results when I searched Cabo San Lucas than when I searched on the website. It happened again when I looked up Sydney and used its prompt “Sydney, New South Wales, Australia” on both the website and the iOS app on my iPhone 6Plus.\n— Jen Leo, Los Angeles Times", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-04T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T07:24:02.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
