This year, the crew will appear in anniversary costumes: Lufthansa is taking advantage of its 60th birthday to recreate the traditional costume from the 1950’s. The fourteen flight attendants will be taking off starting in mid-September to destinations in North America and the Arabian Gulf. On 16 September, they will be off to Charlotte (USA), on 21 September to Vancouver and on 29 September to Dubai. “It is for the ninth time already that our costume crew will carry Bavarian tradition throughout the world. Our passengers will be particularly pleased with this year’s anniversary costume”, says Thomas Klühr, member of the Lufthansa German Airlines Board Finance & Munich Hub.\nThe 1950’s costume was recreated by Munich-based fashion house Angermaier Trachten. The flight attendants’ Wiesn-Dirndl has been recreated in the style of the times, light blue with woven patterns in beige. The apron is beige with discreet light-blue dots. A newspaper report at the Quote: : “Lufthansa stewardesses in real Dirndls will look after passengers on board the Super Constellation from New York to Hamburg, as well as on Lufthansa- Convair planes from London to Munich during the Munich Oktoberfest.”\nOn selected European flights, a Lufthansa CityLine Crew will once again swap their uniforms for Bavarian costumes. The three flight attendants will also wear Dirndls from Munich-based Angermaier Trachten Fashion House. The bodice is yellow with blue flower prints, the skirt has blue and white stripes. In addition, the ladies will wear blue silk aprons.\nLufthansa associates at Munich airport’s passenger service will be wearing Dirndls and jackets this year which were designed by Munich-based fashion company Schustermann & Borenstein exclusively for Lufthansa. During Oktoberfest, many station employees will also be wearing the Lufthansa costume.\nThe Munich Lufthansa Lounges will be supporting the “fifth season” with culinary highlights. The First Class Lounge will offer Bavarian delicacies in the Oktoberfest- decorated restaurant. Specialties, like baked oxtail pralines and wheat beer tiramisu, will be freshly prepared by our cooks. In the Senator Lounges, guests can enjoy apple strudel, a cold platter and pretzels.\nGuests of Lufthansa First Class can also enjoy selected specialties on board during the Oktoberfest. So for example, on the flight to and from Charlotte, a number of culinary highlights will appear on the menu, including the “Tegernseer Schnitzel” or a “Bavarian Oktoberfest Duck.” An iced Kaiserschmarrn or a lukewarm apple strudel will round off the menu.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T18:03:40.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
