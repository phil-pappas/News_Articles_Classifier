Qantas is a great airline with great people and represents the very best of our wonderful country,” Jackman said.\n“Qantas has always had a vital role in promoting Australia as a tourism destination and I am looking forward to playing my part as we work together to showcase our amazing cities, landscapes and experiences in the USA, Asia and beyond.”\nJackman is particularly passionate about encouraging Americans to travel to his homeland to experience the unique land, beauty and people for themselves and says it’s as easy as “getting on a plane, having a few glasses of wine, a meal, watching a movie, having a nap and you are there.”“It’s absolutely worth it when you get there. It’s Australia. Just go!”\nAs well as flying the flag for Australian tourism, Qantas and Jackman will be working on projects to create opportunities for Australian’s to learn, to work, to travel to the USA and to reach their potential.\n“What I also love about Qantas is the role it plays in the community. It’s inspiring to see a company stand up for causes that make a difference and I know it’s something that the Qantas team and its employees are really passionate about.”Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said the airline is thrilled to welcome Hugh Jackman in to the Qantas family as an ambassador.\nSource:- Qantas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:56:04.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
