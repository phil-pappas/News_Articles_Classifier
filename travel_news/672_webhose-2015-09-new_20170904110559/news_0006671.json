Designed by Thailand based talent Architect Space, with Pisit Aongskultong from Pisud Design Company managing the resort’s creative vision and interior designs, the 38 villas have been inspired by stories, cultures, traditions, and lifestyles of these Phuket settlers and is a stark contrast to most hotel accommodation.\nKeemala offers four avant-garde villa choices all complete with private pools and offer a range of both sea and mountain views. The sixteen ‘Clay Pool Cottages’ reflect the earthiness of the ‘Pa-Ta-Pea’ (earth) clan who believed in a strong connection to the earth and harnessed agriculture as their trade. With a selection of one and two-bedrooms, the cottages range in size from 126m2 to 180m2 and with rates starting from THB 19,050+++ and THB 26,640+++, respectively.\nThe tent-like structure and wildlife inspired prints and textures of the seven ‘Tent Pool Villas’ reflect the nomadic way of life of the ‘Khon-Jorn’ (wanderer) clan who consisted of foragers, performers and traders. With a master bedroom and separate living space, the villa size is 140m2 and with rates starting from THB 21,200+++.\nThe seven imaginative ‘Tree Pool Houses’ use building techniques to give the impression that the structures are suspended from trees to represent the ‘We-Ha’ (sky) clan who worshipped the universe. This quirky two-floor villa design is 169m2 and can accommodate up to four guests. Rates start from THB 23,350+++.\nThe ‘Rung-Nok’ (nest) community inspired the design of the eight ‘Bird’s Nest Pool Villas’. This group enjoyed an opulent way of life, thus the exclusive interwoven design of their homes. This villa offers the most exclusive experience of all the villa types, with a total space of 185m2 and with rates starting from THB 25,500+++.\nKeemala offers a range of carefully curated spa treatments, wellness activities and Holistic Living Retreats for those seeking to unwind from the stresses of modern day life.
