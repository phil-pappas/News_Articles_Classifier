This event, dedicated to lovers of nature walkers, intends to raise their awareness of environmental protection in an original way to contribute to the preservation and conservation of the island's territory. Organized for the first time on Reunion Island in 2012, the Pandathlon is an eco-sports event organized in collaboration between the Regional Council of Reunion Island and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) organization in France. The power walks - three routes are available for participants - is above all a unique human adventure which combines sport and environmental protection. \nThe Pandathlon comes as a double challenge as was the case in previous years. On the one hand it is a sporting challenge for individual participants, groups, or families through eco-hiking. On the other hand, the event includes the dimension to serve as a fundraiser in order to fund projects dedicated to maintaining and preserving the island’s unique biodiversity. This year, participants will have the chance to hike the very jagged coast of Reunion Island’s Wild South - land of contrasts between dark volcanic cliffs and the deep blue Indian Ocean. \nThe sporting event is open to all and includes three different courses adapted to the levels of fitness of the expected large number of participants: a 20-kilometer high performance circuit;a 10-kilometer circuit; and a family and child-friendly, 5-kilometer circuit. \nThe hike is of course not a competition per se but rather to encourage a fun outing in a friendly way to promote changes in environmental behavior and to the promotion of eco-friendly outdoor activities. \nPandathlon Partners in 2015 - © Laurent Ample: Panda 5 Panda 10 Panda 20 \nBeyond highlighting environmental issues, Pandathlon also represents a tremendous opportunity to promote the adventure image of Reunion Island, contributing to the tourism development of this French region through the vast network of WWF France. \nTwo journalists were invited on the initiative of Reunion Island Tourism (IRT) to cover this event: a journalist from the French website, Notre-planete.info (600,000 visitors per month), and a reporter from La Libre Belgique (230,500 readers daily). \nThis year the women's basketball team from Reunion Island and champions of France in 2015, will sponsor the fourth edition of Pandathlon. Through them, values linked to sport and respect for the environment will be highlighted as participants enjoy the great outdoors of Reunion Island and the exceptional landscapes of the island which was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO.
