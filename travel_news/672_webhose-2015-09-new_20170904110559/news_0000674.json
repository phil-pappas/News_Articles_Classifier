So, if you are too lazy to wake up for your morning walk, results of this new study may cheer you up. \nThe blood vessels of overweight and obese adults have elevated activity of the small vessel-constricting protein called endothelin (ET)-1. \nBecause of the high ET-1 activity, these vessels are more prone to constricting, becoming less responsive to blood flow demand and increasing risk of developing vascular disease. Exercise has been shown to reduce ET-1 activity but incorporating an exercise regimen into a daily routine can be challenging. \nThis study, conducted at University of Colorado, Boulder in the US, examined whether vitamin C supplements, which have been reported to improve vessel function, can also lower ET-1 activity. \nThe researchers found that daily supplementation of Vitamin C (500 mg/day) reduced ET-1-related vessel constriction as much as walking for exercise did. \nVitamin C supplementation represents an effective lifestyle strategy for reducing ET-1-mediated vessel constriction in overweight and obese adults, the researchers wrote. \nThe findings were presented at the 14th International Conference on Endothelin: Physiology, Pathophysiology and Therapeutics in Savannah, Georgia, US.
