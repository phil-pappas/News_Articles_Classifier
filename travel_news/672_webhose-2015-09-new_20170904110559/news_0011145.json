New-car prices have increased by $1,107 (up 3.4 percent) from August 2014 , while dropping $79 (down 0.2 percent) from last month.\n\"All major automakers are up year-over-year, but September will be a telling month depending on the impact of Labor Day sales and wavering financial market conditions,\" said Akshay Anand , analyst for Kelley Blue Book. \"Hopefully manufacturers will stay disciplined and not over incentivize to meet sales goals if the markets continue to falter.\"\nManufacturer\nAugust\n2015\nTransaction\nPrice\n(Avg.)*\nJuly\n2015\nTransaction\nPrice\n(Avg.)*\nAugust\n2014\nTransaction\nPrice\n(Avg.)*\nPercent\nChange\nJuly\n2015 to\nAugust\n2015*\nPercent\nChange\nAugust\n2014 to\nAugust\n2015*\nAmerican Honda (Acura, Honda)\n$27,276\n$27,518\n$26,521\n-0.9%\n2.8%\nFiat Chrysler (Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, RAM)\n$34,703\n$34,322\n$33,685\n1.1%\n3.0%\nFord Motor Company (Ford, Lincoln)\n$36,420\n$36,394\n$34,584\n0.1%\n5.3%\nGeneral Motors (Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC)\n$38,087\n$38,051\n$37,200\n0.1%\n2.4%\nHyundai-Kia\n$25,287\n$25,418\n$24,219\n-0.5%\n4.4%\nNissan North America (Nissan, Infiniti)\n$28,246\n$28,349\n$27,103\n-0.4%\n4.2%\nToyota Motor Company (Lexus, Scion, Toyota)\n$30,532\n$30,680\n$30,110\n-0.5%\n1.4%\nVolkswagen Group (Audi, Volkswagen, Porsche)\n$39,281\n$39,901\n$38,655\n-1.6%\n1.6%\nIndustry\n$33,543\n$33,622\n$32,436\n-0.2%\n3.4%\n*Kelley Blue Book Average Transaction Prices do not include applied consumer incentives\nAt the segment level, trucks continue to do notably well and the Nissan Titan and Toyota Tacoma should only add fuel to that fire, including increasing average transaction prices. Some of the greatest declines in average transaction prices come from high performance cars. Vehicles in the segment that have dropped month-over-month include models like the BMW 6-Series and Porsche 911 . The economy also is a factor, and as a latter part of August has been tough in terms of the financial markets, which may impact some luxury or pricier segments.\n\"Another segment consistently under scrutiny is the electric vehicle category, which continues to dip in sales as well as average transaction prices, down nearly 3 percent from just last month,\" said Anand. \"In a recent KBB.com survey, 80 percent of consumers reported looking for an electric vehicle as a primary vehicle. However, these shoppers may need more mileage or a more reliable history of this technology before taking the plunge. \"\nSegment\nAugust\n2015\nTransaction\nPrice\n(Avg.)*\nJuly\n2015\nTransaction\nPrice\n(Avg.)*\nAugust\n2014\nTransaction\nPrice\n(Avg.)*\nPercent\nChange\nJuly\n2015 to\nAugust\n2015*\nPercent\nChange\nAugust\n2014 to\nAugust\n2015*\nCompact Car\n$20,560\n$20,579\n$20,336\n-0.1%\n1.1%\nCompact SUV/Crossover\n$27,347\n$27,227\n$26,720\n0.4%\n2.3%\nElectric Vehicle\n$35,880\n$36,933\n$36,269\n-2.9%\n-1.1%\nEntry-level Luxury Car\n$44,926\n$45,488\n$44,114\n-1.2%\n1.8%\nFull-size Car\n$34,597\n$34,505\n$33,390\n0.3%\n3.6%\nFull-size Pickup Truck\n$45,896\n$45,627\n$43,515\n0.6%\n5.5%\nFull-Size SUV/Crossover\n$46,162\n$45,668\n$45,872\n1.1%\n0.6%\nHigh Performance Car\n$89,692\n$91,130\n$93,147\n-1.6%\n-3.7%\nHigh-end Luxury Car\n$88,007\n$87,262\n$91,089\n0.9%\n-3.4%\nHybrid/Alternative Energy Car\n$25,542\n$25,507\n$25,969\n0.1%\n-1.6%\nLuxury Car\n$56,217\n$56,246\n$55,771\n-0.1%\n0.8%\nLuxury Compact SUV/Crossover\n$42,383\n$42,183\n$41,814\n0.5%\n1.4%\nLuxury Full-size SUV/Crossover\n$66,687\n$65,498\n$66,456\n1.8%\n0.3%\nLuxury Mid-size SUV/Crossover\n$55,148\n$55,677\n$53,424\n-1.0%\n3.2%\nMid-size Car\n$25,312\n$25,326\n$24,817\n-0.1%\n2.0%\nMid-size Pickup Truck\n$29,562\n$29,494\n$28,413\n0.2%\n4.0%\nMid-size SUV/Crossover\n$34,180\n$34,215\n$33,084\n-0.1%\n3.3%\nMinivan/Van\n$33,123\n$33,351\n$32,357\n-0.7%\n2.4%\nSports Car\n$31,262\n$31,006\n$31,034\n0.8%\n0.7%\nSubcompact Car\n$18,107\n$18,301\n$17,562\n-1.1%\n3.1%\nIndustry\n$33,543\n$33,622\n$32,436\n-0.2%\n3.4%\n*Kelley Blue Book Average Transaction Prices do not include applied consumer incentives\nTo discuss this topic, or any other automotive-related information, with a Kelley Blue Book analyst on-camera via the company's on-site studio, please contact a member of the Public Relations team to book an interview.\nFor more information and news from Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com, visit www.kbb.com/media/ , follow us on Twitter at www.twitter.com/kelleybluebook (or @kelleybluebook), like our page on Facebook at www.facebook.com/kbb , and get updates on Google+ at https://plus.google.com/+kbb .\nAbout Kelley Blue Book ( www.kbb.com )\nFounded in 1926, Kelley Blue Book, The Trusted Resource® , is the only vehicle valuation and information source trusted and relied upon by both consumers and the automotive industry.
