Even the zipper has a purpose — it easily transforms into a pen that can extend up to four inches. \nThe invention is setting records on Kickstarter , where it has raised more than US$7.25 (NZ$11.39) million from 36,600 people and counting. \nThe jacket's design team, Chicago-based BauBax LLC, originally set a goal of US$20,000, but they have now raised more money than any other clothing item in the short history of Kickstarter. \nIt comes in a few different styles — 100% cotton sweatshirt, water-repellent windbreaker, fleece-lined bomber, and a wrinkle-free blazer. \nEach style has several different colour options, though the hoods on the windbreaker and sweatshirt are not detachable. \nPeople who back the project on Kickstarter should expect to receive their jackets in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:16:06.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
