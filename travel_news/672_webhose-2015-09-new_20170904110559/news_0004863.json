A new Play Room and dedicated education sessions from both meeting and entertainment professionals are set to provide a fresh look at meeting planning.\nThe new Play Room, powered by Play With A Purpose, will be held throughout IMEX America, 13 — 15 October in Las Vegas, offering attendees a creative, interactive, hands on “play space”.\nWith ‘quirkshops’ during Smart Monday on 12 October and on the Inspiration Hub throughout the show, the Play Room will showcase a variety of tools and techniques, providing planners with immediately useable ideas to implement in meetings. Quirkshops will cover room design, technology, networking tools and teambuilding ideas, enabling planners to create more engaging, creative meetings.

According to Inc. Magazine, he is “America’s #1 Strategist” for connecting with the Millennial Generation (also known as Generation Y). His MPI Keynote Managing and marketing to the future of Generation Y on 14 October is set to explore this further, explaining how to tailor sustainability policies, communication, HR and customer service to meet the needs of the attendees of the future.\nPatrick Henry, former Nashville songwriter, performer and MPI keynote says: “If you can’t create an emotional connection with your customers…you’re going to lose them”. His keynote address on 15 October, Becoming ‘Remember-able’, shares real life stories to show how to build an extraordinary customer experience, achieve personal and professional excellence and build loyalty among their team.\nCarina Bauer, CEO of IMEX Group, comments: “In a rapidly evolving marketplace, it’s essential to stay up to date with the latest trends and develop a fresh approach to planning and hosting meetings. Our new Play Room is an exciting new addition to IMEX America.
