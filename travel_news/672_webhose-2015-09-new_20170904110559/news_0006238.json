Rare phenomenon on island of Java turns molten lava BLUE Most mysterious place on Earth? Rare phenomenon on island of Java turns molten lava BLUE THESE staggering images show the moment molten lava turned blue, in one of the world's rarest phenomenons. PUBLISHED: 14:50, Mon, Sep 14, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:57, Mon, Sep 14, 2015 CATERS The blue light is actually caused by sulphuric gas \nThe rare phenomenon can be found at the Kawah Ijen crater, on the island of Java, Indonesia, and was recently visited by British photographer Reuben Wu.Reuben travelled to the remote location in July, snapping stunning pictures of the 'Blue Fire Crater' as it is sometimes called.Though the images may appear to show the lava as a bluish colour, the effect is actually caused by sulphuric gas.The gas works its way to the surface, where it is heated by the lava flow.Temperatures inside the crater reach more than 500C causing the gas to ignite. CATERS Blue Fire crater is known to the people of Java \nThis ignited gas burns with a blue colour, with some appearing to form a blue liquid, flowing over the surface of the lava.Reuben, from Liverpool, said: \"The view was quite overwhelming and I was very close to the fumaroles at the time.\"This meant that I was inside a thick cloud of sulphur gas and it was very difficult to breathe - even through my respirator - let alone take a picture.\" This phenomenon can be witnessed best during darkness, as during the day there is an appearance of a reddish liquid.Reuben became aware of the location in 2009 while on a research trip in Jakarta, but he did not visit the crater and nearby Mount Bromo until this year.The keen snapper, 40, who lives in Chicago, Illinois, USA, visited the crater at sunset and on the two-hour hike documented the stunning surrounding areas.He added: \"I wanted to show not just the look of the blue fire, but also the environment it exists in.\"The crater is stained yellow from the sulphur deposits and the acid lake is bright green and steaming, so it wasn't just the molten sulphur which I wanted to photograph, but the entire scene of very strange forces of nature.\"The most amazing thing is that the fire is really blue - I didn't change the colour.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T17:37:45.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
