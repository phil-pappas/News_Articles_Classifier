Unless he is totally ignorant of the Tory law as it relates to bus services Royston Smith is being massively economical with the truth. He should be well aware that when Thatcher privatised/deregulat ed bus services one of the key parts to the legislation was that bus companies were not allowed to \"cross-subsidise\" routes. ie They could not use the commercially viable services they ran to pay for any that were struggling as this was seen as being uncompetitive and possibly deter other operators from coming in and picking up those routes. He should also be aware the banker generated massive cuts to local authorities also make it impossible for them to come in and subsidise the \"uneconomic\" routes. The bottom line to this is that the public should wake up the the fact that bus companies are not run for the benefit of the public but to line the pockets of shareholders. Now that Jeremy Corbyn has pledged to end the same scandal on the railways, and bring them back into public ownership, here's hoping he will also promise to regulate the bus services again so that they can again be run for the benefit of the public.

In my near biblical span of years it has become clear that both parties end up making a complete mess of it all. What are we to conclude? Perhaps politics attracts the wrong people. My view inherited from my late father 'what did he fail at before going into politics?' Many appear to seek a status in life that would be denied them outside of politics where ability is the criterion. Churchill claimed in his time that we start adulthood as socialists then become liberal and end up as a Tory, he tried two of them more than once. Cynical? Most politicians do not think next bus - next bandwagon to jump on. As an ex long time member of the conservative party now disillusioned as I am sure there are ex long term labour supporters.
