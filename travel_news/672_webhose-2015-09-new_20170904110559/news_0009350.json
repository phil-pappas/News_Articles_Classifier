Another grueling leg, with extreme heat and chaos on the streets, East Coast brothers Brent and Sean struggled to hail cabs and tame catfish in Delhi, India . Falling behind, the brothers arrived last to the Pit Stop at Humayun's Tomb, but were spared from elimination. **Media Note** To download artwork for THE AMAZING RACE CANADA please visit BellMediaPR.ca Episode 309 Recap From the Pit Start in Kolkata , all five teams travelled to Delhi, India's capital city, and one of the most populated places in the world. Once there, teams had to locate the Ghazipur Fish Market and deliver 20 live catfish using a basket. Slimy, squirming catfish took over this challenge, causing Brent and Sean to slip behind the pack. Teams then made their way by tuk-tuk to Faily-Bartha Village, where the Road Block had one team member tying three different turbans on local men for a wedding party. Nick and Matt took the lead and were first to depart to the M Block Market in Greater Kailash in search of their next clue. At the Detour, teams chose between slam it or spice it. In slam it, racers had to learn a series of seven different wrestling moves and perform them in the correct order. In spice it, teams got a taste of the daily grind in India's largest wholesale spice market. Racers had to use a mortar and pestle to manually grind up chili peppers to a fine grind. Aiming for the top spot all season, and coming close many times, Nick and Matt finally did it, and were the first to arrive at the Pit Stop Humayun's Tomb, winning the leg. Host Jon Montgomery greeted them with their leg prize - round-trip tickets from Air Canada to Amsterdam , plus free gas for a year from Petro-Canada.

The five remaining teams still competing for the biggest grand prize in Canadian television history are:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:16:38.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
