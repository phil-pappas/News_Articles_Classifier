USA, 30 September 2015 -- Under the current context of globalization, it is of great significance to compete over energy resources. In respect of transportation, clean and energy-saving transports are thus well advocated. As one of these transports, Airwheel electric scooter is known as a green and eco-friendly transport in a true sense.Airwheel self-balancing electric scooter is powered by electricity, a clean and renewable energy source.
