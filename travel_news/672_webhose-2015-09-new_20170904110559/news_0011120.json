The 16 inns have partnered with three western North Carolina farms, a vineyard and five artisans in the 200-year-old farming community of Sandy Mush in Leicester, situated amid rolling hills 20 minutes northwest of Asheville.\nAvailable from Sept. 1 to Nov. 15, the package includes two nights’ lodging at a member bed-and-breakfast, a map and guide of the community drawn by an area artist, and a picnic lunch to enjoy at Addison Farms Vineyard, which will supply a complimentary wine tasting. Agricultural stops include Sandy Hollar Farms, where visitors can shop for honey and beeswax candles and other handmade crafts; and WhiskeyPigs, a farm that raises pigs on the mash from Troy & Sons whiskey, made by Asheville Distilling Co. Artists on the tour range from potters and quilters to broom makers.\nDoubles range from $140 to $424 nightly, with a minimum two-night stay. Reservations should be made directly through the inns, which can be found at ashevillebba.com .\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
