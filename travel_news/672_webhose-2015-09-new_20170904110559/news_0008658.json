Already, 8.2 million visitors have landed in Dubai in the first seven months of this year.\nHowever, with ambitious targets for 2020, he said an increasingly competitive marketplace targeting the global traveller and challenges to the international travel industry posed by currency devaluations in Asia and Europe, now more than ever we need to ensure that “we are focused on providing a compelling and always evolving destination offer”.\nDubai, for instance, is targeting between 140,000 and 160,000 rooms to accommodate 20 million visitors per year by 2020, according to the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM).\nBetween January and July this year, 11 new properties opened in Dubai, adding more than 2,600 rooms in the city. At the end of July, total rooms stood just shy of 95,000.\nDespite the global macroeconomic conditions, Kazim said that Dubai’s key performance remains relatively stable in the first seven months of this year.\nWith occupied room nights increased by seven per cent year-on-year to an excess of 15 million, the average occupancy rates between January and July stood at 77 per cent while the average daily rate stood at Dh585, RevPar (revenue per available room) at Dh450.\nDubai’s cruise industry has also contributed to the growth, he said and added that the 2014-2015 cruise season saw an overall increase of 15 per cent in ship calls and 42 per cent increase in cruise tourists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:00:36.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
