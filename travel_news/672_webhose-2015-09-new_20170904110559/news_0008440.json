Try to stream a movie and you may find your laptop buffering from Burbank, Calif., to Phoenix. \nBut that may be changing soon, as onboard connectivity companies increasingly shift away from slower ground-based Internet systems to satellite-based systems that could increase speeds more than 2,000 percent. \nThe industry leader, Chicago-based Gogo, provides in-flight Wi-Fi for more than 70 percent of the nation’s airlines, encompassing about 2,400 planes. But most of the planes served by Gogo rely on ground-based cell towers that offer speeds of about 3 megabits per second. \nAt that speed, a 4-gigabyte movie could take three hours to download. And if everybody on the plane tries to download at the same time, Internet speeds could slow to a crawl. \nNext year, Gogo plans to launch a satellite-based Wi-Fi system that can offer speeds of up to 70 megabits per second. Seven airlines have already committed to testing the system on a trial basis or installing it on their entire fleet, Gogo spokesman Steve Nolan said. “The speeds are going to improve greatly,” he said. \nThe other advantage to satellite-based Wi-Fi is that it works on international flights and over a body of water. \nGogo is not the only Wi-Fi provider that promises to turbocharge the service. \nLos Angeles-based Global Eagle Entertainment, which provides Wi-Fi services to Southwest Airlines, among other carriers, announced recently that it had reached an agreement with Boeing Co. to install its satellite-based Wi-Fi system in the factory on new 737 planes, among the world’s most popular commercial aircraft. \nLake Forest, Calif.-based Panasonic Avionics, which provides satellite-based Wi-Fi technology on 800 planes worldwide, plans to unveil an advanced aircraft antenna next month. Working with specially designed high-throughput satellites, Panasonic systems says it can offer Wi-Fi speeds as high as 200 megabits per second. \nGlobal Eagle also plans to soon unveil a new antenna and high-throughput satellites. \nOne of the biggest hurdles to increasing onboard Internet speeds is that airlines that want to switch to satellite-based Wi-Fi must take planes out of service to install the new equipment. Don’t expect the nation’s commercial fleet to make the switch quickly. \n“We will continue to look to see what makes sense,” American Airlines spokesman Casey Norton said about switching American away from its air-to-ground service from Gogo. \nAnd it is not clear if the faster Wi-Fi speeds will mean higher Wi-Fi fees. \n“We haven’t talked about how we are going to price it,” Gogo’s Nolan said. Delta, American end deal to carry each other's passengers \nTwo of the world’s largest airlines have ended a financial agreement that allows them to transfer passengers onto each other’s flights during emergencies, such as storms or hurricanes. \nDelta Airlines and American Airlines last week announced the end to their “interline agreement,” a contract to pay each other an agreed-upon price for carrying each other’s passengers under special circumstances. \nSuch agreements exist between most major carriers so that airlines can put stranded passengers on a competitor’s flight and get reimbursed for the cost. \nDelta blamed the breakup on American, saying American was sending five passengers to Delta for every one flier that Delta sends to American. \n“At that rate, the industry agreement was no longer mutually beneficial,” said Eric Phillips, Delta’s senior vice president for revenue management. \nA computer glitch forced American Airlines to temporarily ground hundreds of flights Thursday. Still, airline spokesman Casey Norton said the disagreement shouldn’t have a major effect on fliers because American still has interline agreements with other competitors. \n“We’ll find other ways to take care of this,” he said. \n©2015 Los Angeles Times Visit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
