(Photo: Laurel Robbins) \nBy Laurel Robbins / Monkeys and Mountains \nLadies, if you’re planning to visit Oktoberfest in Munich , you’ll want to know these tips. \n1. Wear a dirndl: It’s not required, but most women will be wearing them and it’s a great way to get into the spirit of Oktoberfest. An authentic dirndl will set you back at least $250, but you can also buy a cheaper one for less than $65. You will find a variety of stores around Marienplatz. Another alternative is to buy a second-hand one. This is also your chance to wear braids — two school-girl plaits or a giant one wrapped around your head, the choice is yours! \n2. Indicate your relationship status by where you tie your dirndl: Knot it on the right to show that you’re taken. A knot on the left shows that you are single, while a knot in the front middle means you are a virgin. A knot in the back means you are widowed. Unfortunately there is no way to tell a man’s marital status from his lederhosen. 3. Wear flats: A huge part of Oktoberfest is dancing to songs like this one, on the benches. Trust me, you do not want to be doing this in heels. The benches can be wobbly with 12 drunk people jumping up and down on them. Not only is it difficult to dance on a narrow wobbly bench in heels, it’s also very easy to lose your balance and end up spraining an ankle. \nRelated: Can’t Make it to Germany for Oktoberfest?

Bring a small cross-body purse: I made the mistake of bringing a regular-size purse the first time I went to Oktoberfest. This was a really bad idea. First, there’s no place to put it down. The floor is dirty and covered in beer, plus it isn’t safe (you never want to leave valuables unattended at Oktoberfest). The table is covered in beer, so that’s not an option either. As a result, you end up holding your purse the entire time — much easier to do when it’s a small cross-body purse, with only a few essentials in it. \nRelated: Prost!

You have two options, neither of which is desirable: 1) Wear it and sweat like crazy or 2) put it on the floor and have it get dirty and soaked in beer at best, or at worst stolen. If the weather is really chilly, bring a light sweater. It’s better to be a little uncomfortable while getting to and from Oktoberfest and to be comfortable while you’re in the tents than the other way around. \nRelated: Tap into This: 10 Ways to Have the Best Oktoberfest Ever \n6.

If it’s VIPs and celebrity spotting you’re after you’ll want to hit the upscale Kafer Wisn’n-Schanke. If you’re single and ready to mingle (and in your 20s), the Hippodrom is the place to be — it’s known as the “flirt tent”. Don’t drink beer? Then check out the wine tent! Each tent has its own flair and a different atmosphere. \n7. Drink responsibly: Beer is served in one-liter jugs and has a higher alcohol content than what you’re probably used to, so go easy! Prost, as they say in German and don’t forget to look everyone in the eyes as you clink glasses.
