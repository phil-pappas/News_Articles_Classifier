Redfern’s unique online booking tool is used by more than 500 companies and the UK and Scottish governments. tRIPS hit the 10 million customer mark just days after securing a £100m contract with the Scottish government. “We like to make life straightforward and easy for customers,” said Redfern Chief Executive Mark Bowers. \n“Our unique end to end booking tool was introduced in 2009 and quickly revolutionised the business travel market. It is incredible to think that 10 million customers have booked travel through tRIPS. “Not only does tRIPS make life easier for the traveller, it analyses journey options and suggests cheaper off-peak alternatives and different travel options. Redfern’s technology supports policy compliance whilst at the same time providing a very simple to use interface.” Since Redfern was awarded the contract for the UK government’s travel management service in 2012 it has saved the Treasury a reported £5m in fees per annum. That figure is expected to rise again as Redfern adds the Scottish government and a number of large private sector businesses to its portfolio. “Redfern’s unique technology takes customers door to door with the simple click of a button,” added Mark Bowers. “When tRIPS was developed, we knew it had the potential to revolutionise travel booking and that’s exactly what it’s done. “We’re constantly investing in new technology and I am sure it won’t be long until we’re seeing our 20 millionth passenger.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:57:42.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
