But before you rent a car in Japan, it's useful to understand some of the rules. \nSpecifically, unlike many European countries, American drivers will need to have an International Drivers Permit (note: it's sometimes called an International Driving License) to drive in Japan. If you're caught driving in Japan without one, you risk fines, arrest, or possible deportation. In other words, they're serious about it. \nKeep in mind, that an International Drivers Permit needs to be used in conjunction with a valid United States license. It's basically a translation of your existing drivers license into different languages, and provides some identifying information (photo, address, etc.). In the U.S. they can be obtain at AAA offices as well as from the National Automobile Club, typically for a fee of $15. \nConsiderations when Driving in Japan \nIt's also important to note that driving in Japan can be very different from driving in the United States. Unless you can read Japanese, road signs can be difficult to understand. Highway tolls are expensive, traffic can be extremely bad, and there's little roadside parking. Roads may also be narrower and traffic flows on the left. \nAnother issue with driving in Japan is insurance. In many cases, U.S. auto insurance will not provide coverage for Japan. Yet Japan requires insurance for all drivers, so you need to make sure you have the proper insurance. \nExtended Stays and Driving Tips \nIf you're going to be staying for over 12 months in Japan, you will need to apply for a Japanese driver's license. You may be required to take a written driving test, a hearing test, an eyesight test, and a road test. It's best to consult the U.S. Embassy or the Japanese government for current requirements. \nFor additional driving tips for Japan, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo has some helpful hints for driving in Japan that are worth consulting. \nThe Japan National Tourist board is also a good resource for business travelers to Japan. Their website provides information on Japanese driving permits, insurance and more. \nDon't pay too much for an IDP! There are many online outlets selling international driving permits for greatly inflated prices. For more information, read my article on International Drivers Permits scams .
