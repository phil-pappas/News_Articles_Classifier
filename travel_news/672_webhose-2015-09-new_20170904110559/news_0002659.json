They made love all night long and he dragged himself out of bed onto the aeroplane and had a perfectly anxiety-free flight.\" Bunn told Yahoo Travel. \nBut although sex may be a quick-fix to help some frightened flyers, he concludes this it won't help travellers deal with with the cause of their anxiety.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T00:07:27.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
