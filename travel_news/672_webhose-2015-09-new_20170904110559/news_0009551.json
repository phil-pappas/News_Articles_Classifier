\nOne thing you do need to get used to is the lack of toilets or even outhouses. The inter-tidal flush is the preferred method of human waste disposal and you can either go bidet-style or use toilet paper and burn or pack it out. \nOur group had a blue toilet bag filled with the necessary supplies, including hand sanitizer, which we nicknamed \"Steve\" and each campsite had a designated bathroom area by the water which we dubbed \"Steve Town.\" \nThe paddling - through choppy open sea, narrow inlets with rushing tides and calm, secluded bays - was exceptional and the intense feelings you get while rhythmically gliding through morning mist are almost indescribable. \nThe tour encompassed a number of destinations, including the unbelievable SGang Gwaay, the abandoned whaling station at Rose Harbour, a former cannery and saltery site and Burnaby Narrows, a rich intertidal channel where hundreds of marine species are concentrated in a kaleidoscope of various colorful sea stars, anemones, jellyfish, snails, mussels, sea urchins, clams and crabs. \nOne of the wildlife highlights happened as we were kayaking from Burnaby Narrows to our nearby campsite. A black bear we had earlier seen on the shore of a small island decided to swim back across right in front of us. It was incredible as we watched it clamber out, shake the water off itself like a big dog and then mosey on its way. \nSome of the best marine life encounters we had on the trip came as we crossed Carpenter Bay and were treated to numerous sightings of humpback whales, including one who breached only 10 to 15 metres away from my kayak. \nI was also lucky enough to be looking behind us later and had the perfect viewing angle as a humpback flashed me its tail fluke while preparing to dive down to the deep. \nAnother awe-inspiring sight occurred on our last night when I got up at 2 a.m. and stumbled through the dark to the beach. First, I looked up and was put in my lowly place by the zillion stars twinkling above me. Then, I gazed upon the water and was wonderstruck by the dancing lights caused by bioluminescence, a natural phenomenon caused by chemical reactions in marine organisms. \nIt certainly was a trip of a lifetime that I will never forget and I would recommend it highly to everyone. \nThere is evidence that the Haida people have lived on Haida Gwaii for more than 12,500 years, with scientists now saying it could be even a thousand years longer, and stories of the fascinating ancient indigenous culture live on at several protected sacred village sites. \nOn a recent kayaking trip in the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve in the south of Haida Gwaii, I visited SGang Gwaay - a UNESCO World Heritage site - and was enthralled by the Watchmen-led tour of the remains of carved mortuary poles and traditional cedar longhouses. \nThe Watchmen live at the five village sites as guardians, to protect their natural and cultural heritage, and our guide, Ken, blew our minds with his vast knowledge of the passed-on-by-mouth legends of his ancestors. \nHe explained the way the mortuary poles - a type of totem pole - were built, what they signified, what the various crests on them meant and how the preserved bodies of chiefs would be placed inside grave boxes at the top of them, serving as both a tomb and a headstone. \nAccording to a Gwaii Haanas visitor guide, there were about 20,000 Haida when Europeans first made contact and the population plummeted as a result of communicable diseases such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis being introduced by the visitors. By the late 1800s, there were fewer than 600 Haida left on Haida Gwaii. \nSURVIVORS \nThe survivors from the southern villages gathered at SGang Gwaay - which means Wailing Island, a name based on a sound created at certain tides when air was forced through a hole in a rock on the island - but eventually they moved northward to join other Haida clans. \nSGang Gwaay represents one of the best examples in the world of a traditional Northwest Coast First Nations village site and the remains of some of its 20 or so longhouses are still evident when you visit. \nKen explained the intricate way the longhouses at the winter village site were constructed, including the use of plank walls that could be removed and used for other structures during the summer, and how the various rooms were used to put up visitors and host celebrations. \nHe also told very interesting stories about his Haida Gwaii ancestors being able to travel long distances by canoe at a time when the seas were much lower than they are today and said they used to trade with people in places as far away as California, Australia and New Zealand. \nPeople are able to visit SGang Gwaay and the other four village sites from May to September, but only 12 people at a time are allowed on shore and you need to first ask the Watchmen for permission to land. \nFACTS \n* Haida Gwaii, formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands, is a group of islands off of the west coast of northern British Columbia. \n* You can get there by either flying to airports at Masset, on Graham Island, or Sandspit, on Moresby Island, or by a six-hour B.C. ferry ride from Prince Rupert. \n* In order to go to the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, you must pay a visitor fee and take an hour-long orientation session. \n* Kayaking tours are only available through licensed tour operators and it costs about $3,000 for an eight-day trip. \n* Parks Canada and Haida Nation publish an online Gwaii Haanas Trip Planner that is full of information and contains a list of licensed operators and links to their websites.
