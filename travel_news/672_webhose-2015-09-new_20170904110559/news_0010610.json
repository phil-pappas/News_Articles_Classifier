This initiative was in support of the biggest cleanliness drive, The Swachch Bharat Abhiyaan. \nStudents along with faculty members joined the team of Crowne Plaza Today New Delhi Okhla for a six-kilometer walkathon cum cleanliness drive from the hotel to Tughlakabad, to spread the message of keeping the surroundings clean for sustainable tourism. The event was a great success and the efforts of students and hotel employees were appreciated by one and all. \nIndia is getting attention from more and more international hotel and other chains, reflecting the potential of the Indian market. \nHowever, not all are jumping in to set up properties on their own or in partnership with local partners. Some, like Belmond, for the moment just want more Indians to use the chain hotels in other established markets. \nIndian outbound is growing, and all players want a slice of this cake. Belmond is doing well in India for some of its properties in Bali and Thailand, but now wants Indians to use hotels in places like Peru. \nA top team of the exclusive chain was in India recently to boost awareness. A full office may still be some time away, but its presence through reps is in place. \nIn recent months, several US chains and hotels have also been active in India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:08:46.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
