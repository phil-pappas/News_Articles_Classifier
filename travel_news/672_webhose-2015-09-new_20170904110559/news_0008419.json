(Satish Bate/HT photo) \nAs we enter Pernia Qureshi’s residence in Bandra, she welcomes us in a navy-blue shift dress. The celebrated stylist for the film Aisha (2010) speaks to us about her love for femininity, classic designs and minimalist accessories. \nFASHION SENSIBILITY : “For me, fashion is expressing yourself through what you’re wearing. It’s the best way to convey who you are without having to say much.” \nGO-TO DESIGNER : “I don’t really have a particular one. I like Payal Pratap and Dhruv Kapoor’s work. Also, I think Nimish Shah’s recent collection is really great.” \nMOST ATTACHED TO : “My pyjamas and track pants. Every time I come home, the first thing I do is change into them. They are super comfortable.” \nMOST EXPENSIVE SPLURGE : “I make my mother buy all the really expensive things (laughs). I personally don’t go ahead and buy something that is too expensive.” \nSIMPLY ACCESSORISED : “I’m not big on accessories. I usually keep it really simple. However, recently, I’ve been wearing a lot of tikkas and jhoomars. They look very pretty and brighten up your face if you’re going out for weddings or festive occassions.” \nSTYLE QUIRK : “My style is quite feminine and classy. However, I don’t think I have a particularly defining one as such. ” \nONLINE BUYER : “I shop online all the time. Ninety per cent of the items in my wardrobe have been bought off virtual stores.” \nIMPULSIVE SHOPPER : “I used to be one. I would buy anything and everything. But I think I’ve changed over the years. Now I only buy things that I love and that mean something to me.” \nFASHION FAUX PAS : “I think ‘wrong choices’ would be a more appropriate term, because I have always been happy with what I have worn, at the time. For instance, I used to wear these tiny T-shirts on jeans during college (laughs). Today, when I look back at some of the outfits, I won’t necessarily wear them, but I won’t consider it a faux pas either.” \nTo dress up for a night on the town \n\"I think a pair of slinky sandals are great. They make your legs look long and sleek and you can wear it with anything from jeans and a pair of shorts to trousers and dresses.” \n“Blow-dry your hair to add shine and bounce to any hairdomake it look shinier and bouncier.” \n“Use a bright lipstick, especially if you’re going out after work. It helps liven up your face no matter how tired you are.” \n“Keep a little black dress in your wardrobe. It’s a safety net for those days when you feel tired and don’t want to spend too long on deciding what to wear.” \n(HT photos: Satish Bate)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:23:47.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
