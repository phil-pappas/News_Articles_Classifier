Still, socks, jocks and – ahem – power tools. \n\"Hey, Dad, how about you celebrate by repairing everything that's broken in the house? Happy Father's Day!\" \nIt's never talked about in terms of relaxation. Why not take dad away for some quality family time? \nIn honour of modern parenting, here are some suggestions just for dad, from our friends at Hotels.com : \nNATURE DAD \nEscape the hustle and bustle of the city this Father's Day with a weekend escape to Rotorua. \nGrab a bike and take to the trails in a city that has been hailed the 'mountain-biking mecca' of New Zealand. Enjoy a unique taste of nature as you zip-through a canopy of native trees or take a leisurely kayak on one of the local lakes. And of course no trip to Rotorua is complete without a relaxing soak at the Polynesia spa. \nThe perfect mini-break for those stressed-out dads. See Millennium Hotel Rotorua . Rooms start from $110 per night. \nADVENTURE DAD \nLooking for a bit of adventure? Why not treat your dad to an action-packed weekend in Queenstown. Start the day off with a trek or bike ride on one of Queenstown's scenic trails. \nEnjoy watching your dad squeal in terror as he launches himself from one of Queenstown's iconic bungy jumps. Take a spin on the Shotover Jet and end the day drinking in the stunning alpine views with a cruise aboard the TSS Earnslaw across Lake Wakatipu. See Best Crowne Plaza Hotel . Rooms start from NZ$174 per room per night. \nWINE LOVER \nHave a dad who likes to indulge in the finer things in life? There could be no better place to spend Father's Day than in Marlborough, one of New Zealand's premier wine-growing regions. Take dad on one of the many wine tours - a true celebration of the best food and wine New Zealand has to offer. \nThe Marlborough Vintners Hotel will see you staying in a wine-lovers paradise with the choice of a vineyard or garden view room. So what are you waiting for? Grab dad and a bottle (or two) and spoil him with a quality escape in the bountiful beauty of Marlborough. See Marlborough Vintners Hotel . Rooms start from NZ$170 per night. \nARTISTIC DAD \nIf you are the proud child of a dad who can tell his Rembrandt from his Monet then head to Wellington for a weekend. Not only is Wellington our very own 'Capital of Cool' the city also boasts the incredible Museum Art Hotel. \nDecorated with classic and modern pieces from local New Zealand artists; the Museum Art Hotel celebrates some of New Zealand's finest talent. Make the most of your getaway by taking a stroll around the Museum of New Zealand - Te Papa Tongarewa. Finish the day with a few drinks on the vibrant Cuba Street before returning to your hotel for dinner at the exquisite Hippopotamus Restaurant and Bar. See Museum Art Hotel . Rooms start at NZ$259 per night \nTHE TOURIST \nLooking to take dad a little further afield? Why not jump across the ditch for a sneaky weekend break. The Opera House, Circular Quay and Harbour Bridge are all within walking distance of the family-friendly Novotel Sydney Central. Catch a film at IMAX Darling Harbour before taking a dip in the hotel's heated, rooftop, outdoor pool. The breakfast buffet here is outstanding – and it's free for two children under 16, sharing a room with their parents. Rooms start at $189 per night. See www.novotel.com \nTrust us – it's a much better option than socks and jocks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:34:47.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
