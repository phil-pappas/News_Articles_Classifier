Each collection of Bella | Ha shoes is inspired by, and benefits an area of the world in need. The sale of each pair of shoes helps to send Solar Suitcases to birth clinics in these areas. The very first Solar Suitcase that Bella | Ha has donated was installed in the Cam Binh Clinic, at the Cam Binh Island Commune, Cam Ranh City, Khanh Hoa province, Vietnam , on Saturday, September 5th .\nSolar Suitcases are portable, solar-powered units that provide surgical light and power for medical and mobile communication devices, both essential in birthing rooms. They are created by We Care Solar, Bella | Ha's giving partner.\nIn many areas of the world, power is either extremely unreliable or nonexistent, and because of this, infant and maternal mortality rates are extremely high. By equipping off-grid medical clinics with these life-saving suitcases, Bella | Ha helps to facilitate safe childbirth and reduce maternal and infant illness and mortality.\n\"We like to say that our story begins and ends with a suitcase,\" says Bella | Ha founder Keely Solimene , \"When you pack up your suitcase and take off to the far corners of the world, you see things that will change you forever. We have seen so many things on our travels…both wonderful and heartbreaking. And that travel has inspired us…to give Solar Suitcases to birth clinics in the places we have been, beginning with the Khanh Hoa province in Vietnam .\"\nThe Khanh Hoa province was not a random choice for the first collection. In fact, it was chosen for a reason that is very personal to Ms. Solimene and her family. Her adopted Vietnamese daughter was born there. Isabella, or Bella, was adopted when she was four years old from an orphanage in Nha Trang, Vietnam . After the adoption, the Solimene family learned that she had a twin, named Ha, still living in poverty in a remote village outside of Nha Trang . It took years of searching to locate and finally meet her. The Solimene family has supported and remains close with Ha. And because of this experience, they resolved to help even more in the area.\nSo the Bella | Ha brand was born. And this is why the installation of this first Solar Suitcase is so significant. It marks both the culmination and the commencement of extraordinary journeys.\n\"The delivery of this first solar suitcase may lead to a little Vietnamese baby being safely born on an island in the East Sea tonight!\" Keely says.\nWho is Bella | Ha?\nBella | Ha is a mission-driven, travel-inspired luxury goods company that makes beautifully crafted Italian-made shoes that give back. Each collection of Bella | Ha shoes is inspired by, and benefits an area of the world in need. The sale of shoes from the first collection, the Khanh Hoa collection, sends Solar Suitcases to the southern Vietnamese province of the same name. The next collection will benefit Ethiopia . Bella | Ha will continue spreading light to birth clinics all over the world.
