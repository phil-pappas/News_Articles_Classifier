Architect, Fazioli and Zhang Huan (pictured)\nThe ensuite bathroom was the most peaceful spot in the entire suite, with a separate glass-enclosed shower, double sinks, a TV screen in the mirror and L’Occitane en Provence toiletries.\nThe only thing it lacked was speakers in the walk-in shower so that guests could listen to a TV programme – such as a morning news broadcast or evening sporting event – or music.\nBut that is a small detail compared with the amenities in the spacious suite, including an Apple iPad, a well-stocked minibar, Nespresso machine, 24-hour in-room dining and even a yoga mat.\nWith the push of a button next to the double bed, guests can switch the lights on or off, open or close the drapes and activate the do not disturb signal outside the door.\nThe spacious one-bedroom owner's suite has amazing city views from the master bathroom, which boasts floor-to-ceiling windows\nThe Shangri-La suite features a private balcony and a private butler's entrance, and can be converted into a three-bedroom suite\nDuring the day the Health Club pool, lap pool and whirlpool have plenty of natural light with panoramic city views from cabanas\nThis is standard throughout the hotel’s 202 rooms and suites, which offer a contemporary and classical style that even a big budget film star would appreciate.\nDuring TIFF, the hotel extends its bar hours, brings in live entertainment and becomes one of the places to mingle with industry types, as it’s just down the street from the festival’s headquarters and not far from Yorkville, another hotspot.\nOn a Friday night, Bosk was buzzing with locals who were saying goodbye to a long work week, and couples who were kicking off a romantic night out.\nServing modern Canadian cuisine, the 80-seat restaurant served a set dinner menu for CAD$45 (approximately £22), using seasonal ingredients sourced from the region.\nThe Bar is a busy spot at the weekend, attracting locals who are unwinding after work on a Friday or heading out to the theatre\nShangri-La Toronto, set in a 66-storey hotel-condominium tower, opened three years ago and is Toronto's 10th tallest building\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video The Shangri-La is one of the best hotels in Downtown Toronto\nWatch video Some of the stunning surroundings of La Sultana in Marrakech\nWatch video Tom Hardy shuts down reporter when asked about his sexuality\nWatch video The shock return of Farrah and Jenna to the CBB house\nWatch video Argument erupts between Jenna and Natasha in CBB house\nWatch video Holly the husky gets jealous and she knows how to show it\nWatch video Britain's biggest tube web spider found in Whitstable garden\nWatch video GRAPHIC: Jailhouse beating of terror suspect Carlos Larmond\nWatch video Topless Femen activists storm stage at Muslim conference\nWatch video James drops double fake eviction bombshell!\nWatch video New ISIS video claims 'we are back in America'\nWatch video GRAPHIC: Footage shows pit-bulls viciously attack man\nStarters included a delicious fillet of lightly smoked trout (with wheat berry, cucumber and lemon crème fraiche dressing), while the mains were highlighted by perfectly prepared beef striploin with potato puree, roasted carrot, onion and mustard jus.\nAfter dinner, my friend and I stopped at The Bar for what was supposed to be a quick drink before taking a wander through the entertainment district.\nMany hotel bars are in a sad state, but this is not the case at the Shangri-La, where it’s packed with a mix of guests and locals, and there is no need to escape after one glass of Canadian rye whiskey.\nTo coincide with Clooney’s stay during TIFF, the bar was reportedly stocked with his own brand of tequila, Casamigos.\nWhile there are plenty of opportunities to mingle and socialise, guests can seek privacy at Miraj Hammam Spa by Caudalie Paris.\nFor 45 minutes, my skin was given a once-over with a revitalising hammam, gommage and rhassoul clay body masque treatment.\nAfter sitting in a steam room for 10 minutes, my body was scrubbed down with exfoliating gloves before the masque was applied and then removed, with the celebrity treatment leaving my skin feeling its smoothest in years.\nTRAVEL FACTS Shangri-La Toronto\n180 University Ave, Toronto, ON M5H 0A2, Canada\n+1 416-599-0333\nwww.shangri-la.com/toronto/shangrila\nRooms from CAD$555 (approximately £270) a night.\nMiraj Hammam Spa by Caudalie Paris\n+1 647 253 5770\nwww.mirajcaudaliespa.com/contact-us\nRead more: Hotel in Toronto -
