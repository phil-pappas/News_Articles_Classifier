The samples were sent to a lab to estimate the total bacteria population per square inch. \nTray tables were found to have almost 10 times the bacteria of lavatory flush buttons. \nThe tray table by average has 2,155 germ colony-forming units per square inch (CFU/sq.in), followed by drinking fountain buttons (1,240 CFU/sq.in), overhead air vents (285 CFU/sq.in), lavatory flush buttons (265 CFU/sq.in), seat belt buckles (230 CFU/sq.in) and bathroom stall locks (70 CFU/sq.in). \nComparing that with household items, the United States' National Science Foundation found home toilet seats carry 172 CFU/sq.in while mobile phone surfaces have 27 CFU/sq.in and a banknote carries about 5 CFU/sq.in. \nFortunately, all 26 samples from the aeroplanes and airports were free from decal coliforms such as E.coli. \nThe research demonstrates the need for tray tables to be cleaned between flights, and not only at the end of the day, stated the study. \nIt also suggested airlines increase efficiency of boarding and deplaning to give cabin crew more time to do a thorough cleaning between flights.

Investment in yacht show \nThe Transport Ministry will invest 15 million baht to host the Phuket Yacht Show in February. \nThe purpose is to promote Thailand as the marina hub of the Asean area, according to Transport Deputy Minister Ormsin Chivapruck. The ministry expects the event will be the largest showcase of international sailing boats with 150 yachts and more than 10 luxury superyachts, which are popular among travellers in the Mediterranean. \nThe event will be organised from Feb 8-14. It was planned to run for two months in November and December this year. The postponement will help extend the time for preparation and promoting the event at an international level, he said. \n\"People who travel with their yachts are one of the prime targets for the tourism industry because they are high spenders,\" he said. \nThe Phuket Yacht Show is expected to attract 3,000 visitors. \nThe ministry also plans to revise rules and regulations to allow those who travel by yacht to the Kingdom to be able to stay longer or they can register their yachts for a renting service in the future.
