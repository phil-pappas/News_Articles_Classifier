When Mr Heselden was called to a stranded Audi A1 last December, he was told that the owner had mislaid a young feline somewhere in its interior. “The first thing to do in these circumstances is make contact with the customer and ease their anxiety,” Mr Heselden explains. “I get it all the time when parents have accidentally locked their kids in the car or trapped their dog inside. So I always give them a call, tell them I’m on my way, and try to stop them from panicking.” We weren’t sure precisely where it had got to which made things even more interesting It’s easy to see how this particular state of affairs came about. The Audi’s owner had the kitten in a box, ready to surprise her daughter with an early Christmas present. But it was making a noise, so she left it in the car for a few minutes until the time of the big reveal. Trouble is, the box wasn’t quite shut. So the kitten clambered out and went AWOL in the A1’s interior. “We weren’t sure precisely where it had got to,” Mr Heselden continues, “which made things even more interesting. We could hear it meowing behind the dashboard and tried tempting it out with treats. But it soon became clear that this wouldn’t work.” Mr Heselden realised he would have to start stripping the Audi’s interior in order to locate the cat. “I’m a Volkswagen Group technician for the AA,” he explains, “so I know my way around these vehicles. It was just a question of taking a logical approach in order not to harm the kitten.” It may sound like a trivial job, but when I pulled that cat free, it felt like Christmas had come early First off was the dashboard panel, which revealed a pair of eyes glinting behind the steering wheel. “I tried to reach for the cat, which appeared to be stuck fast,” Mr Heselden recounts. “But it wasn’t having any of it, and just tried to scratch me each time I got near.” By now, the technician realised this wasn’t going to be the most straightforward rescue in his 12-year career with the AA. “The kitten’s feet were tangled with the wires at the top of the fuse box,” he says. “I ended up removing the throttle pedal and various other bits of trim, before finally managing to grab the cat by the scruff of its neck and ease it out.” Needless to say, the moment of triumph prompted celebrations from the kitten’s owner, and Mr Heselden also admits to feeling pretty chuffed. “It may sound like a trivial job,” he reflects. “But when I pulled that cat free, it felt like Christmas had come early for me, too!” When the unpredictable happens, the AA is there to help.
