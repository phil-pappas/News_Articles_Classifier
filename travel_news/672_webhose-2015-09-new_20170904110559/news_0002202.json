As we made our way with our driver to Pook’s Lodge in the heart of the jungle, I was surprised and excited about what I saw of Belize. \nI was expecting a country that was quite developed and ‘Americanized’, but it was grittier and less developed than what I thought. I was excited not only because that’s the type of travel I prefer, but I was excited to expose Allie to something that was quite different from her normal view. She said very little as we drove deeper into the jungle down bouncy, crumbling dirt roads. >>Read also: Belize: I think I hate the jungle and Why vacation in Belize \nI wondered what was going through her head as she looked out the window at the simple living conditions and daily life of people in Belize.
