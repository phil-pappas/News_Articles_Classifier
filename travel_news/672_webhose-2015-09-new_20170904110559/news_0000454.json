The new guidelines are a very important step towards ensuring that all people living with HIV have immediate access to antiretroviral treatment,\" UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe said.\n\"According to UNAIDS estimates, expanding (antiretroviral treatment) to all people living with HIV and expanding prevention choices can help avert 21-million AIDS-related deaths and 28-million new infections by 2030.\"\nUnder current WHO guidelines, 28-million people are deemed eligible for antiretroviral treatment.\nMajor suppliers of HIV drugs include Gilead, ViiV Healthcare, which is majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and multiple Indian generic manufacturers.\nAll people at \"substantial\" risk of contracting HIV should also be given preventive antiretroviral treatment, not just men who have sex with men, the WHO said.\nThe medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) welcomed the move to expand treatment but warned that \"turning this new recommendation into reality would require dramatically increased support from donors and governments\".\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:25:34.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
