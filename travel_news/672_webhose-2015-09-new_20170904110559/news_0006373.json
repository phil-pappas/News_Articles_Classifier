Now You Can Buy a Flight on Frontier Airlines Brittany Jones Cooper Editor, Yahoo Travel September 4, 2015 \nFrontier knows how to do cheap flights. (Photo: Frontier Airlines) \nIf you have a $20 bill in your pocket, that might just be enough to book a flight to your favorite destination. \nThis week, Frontier Airlines unveiled their “Fly for a Buck” campaign, highlighting flights for just $1 (technically $15 after fees etc.) Sadly, those uber cheap flights have already sold out, but there are some other ridiculously cheap fares that you need to take advantage of before they’re all gone. \nIf you have Andrew Jackson in your wallet, you can book a flight from Austin to Las Vegas for just $15. That’s about the price of two burritos from Chipotle (with guac, of course!) \nIf you live in Minneapolis, you can fly to New Orleans, Orlando, or Cincinatti for just $29 one-way! That’s cheaper than a tank of gas! Some other $29 fares include Washington D.C. to Cincinnati and Las Vegas to Denver. \nRelated: The Best Apps for Finding a Cheap Flight \nSan Francisco is beautiful this time of year. (Photo: Thinkstock) \nAs a major hub, Chicago is also stacked with amazing deals. A round-trip ticket from Chicago’s O’Hare to San Francisco typically costs at least $220. But on Frontier, you can now book a one-way for $50! That’s $100 for a round-trip ticket, which means you can buy two trips for the price of one! \nTravelers flying from Chicago can also find one-way tickets to Philadelphia, Atlanta, or Austin for just $39. \nWith fares to and from most major cities, it’s worth browsing if you’re looking for a deal. While these fares are super low, keep in mind that these are one-way prices, and the travel dates are limited to this fall. Frontier Airlines also charges passengers fees for carryon bags and reserved seats. \nTo save even more, use the promo code 5OFF at checkout to save $5. \nHappy booking! \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
