So far, the first half of 2015 has seen a 21 per cent increase in ship calls and 42 per cent increase in the number of cruise tourists.\nBuilding on the 2014 roadshow, Dubai’s delegation showcased the emirate, as not only a key leisure destination but also a gateway to the Mediterranean, Northern Europe, North Africa, Far East, Australia and North America.\nHamad bin Mejren, senior vice president, Dubai Tourism, said: “There is an increasing appetite amongst Chinese tourists to discover destinations differently and cruising from Dubai is a concept they have embraced with enthusiasm. China ranks 20 in the top source markets for Dubai’s Cruise Tourism as we were able to communicate successfully about what makes Dubai a must-visit destination for the Chinese travellers during our previous roadshow. With this visit, we are hoping to build on that success and further boost the number of Chinese Cruise tourists visiting the Emirates.\nThe multiple entry UAE visa offered exclusively for cruise tourists has also facilitated a more efficient journey for Chinese tourists visiting Dubai. The visa, which can be applied through the cruise line on which the passenger books the cruise itinerary, enables Chinese tourists to enter and exit the country through any of its airports or seaports any number of times. The visa is valid for 60 days from the date of issue to the first entry into the UAE, following which it remains valid for 30 days.\nThe cruise season in Dubai runs from September to June, with 2015-2016 expected to see a total of 128 cruise ship calls in the city, bringing more than 465,000 cruise tourists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:09:12.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
