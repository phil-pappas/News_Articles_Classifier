But when she got the call to say she’d won she got a little concerned, asking the bearer of good tidings: “Is it okay if I am Paul O’Connell’s mother?” Paul O’Connell, of course, being the 105 times capped Irish and Lions second row. Fans of course, found it amusing. Paul O'Connell Checklist: http://t.co/4RoP4wBh3q #RWC2015 2.Sort your mother for tickets... Aaahm Oh Paulie http://t.co/8Uyx9EKihM — Peter O' Dwyer (@peterodwyer1) September 26, 2015 But it turns out Mrs. O’Connell wasn’t entering to get tickets because her son never bothers to sort her out for freebies, it was more that she wanted to enjoy the transport and accommodation that comes with them. “To be honest, match tickets are not the problem,” explains Mrs. O’Connell. “It’s the flights and actually getting there. For the last game, when Ireland played Canada in Cardiff, we had to fly into London, followed by a four-hour drive to Cardiff. I wasn’t the best after sitting in the car for four hours.” It's been quite a week for the Irish forward. His picture from Ireland's Alton Towers trip this week is widely agreed to be the picture of the tournament so far.

Rumour has it brother Justin and Marcus will “go mad” when they find out. We’ll update you in there are any further developments.
