Story highlights App makes splitting bills easier in China But older Chinese still uneasy about going Dutch Paying traditionally an honor and they fear 'losing face\" Beijing (CNN) No messy coins -- and more importantly -- no embarrassment. This is how young Chinese \"go Dutch\" these days -- scan a QR code and pay their share via smart phones in one easy click or swipe. It was the first time most of the 13 people at my dinner table last weekend had used the function on social networking tool WeChat and they were sold. \"It has made going Dutch less hassle and so much more fun,\" said Zhou Ye, a Beijing-based journalist. \"Young people think splitting bills this way is fun, and older ones may find it fashionable to do so.\" Most importantly, it saves people the embarrassment of figuring out who owes what. Splitting the bill is a relatively new idea to most Chinese. It's being embraced by cash-strapped young people, but for many older folks, who fear \"losing face,\" it feels embarrassing and stingy. At dinner parties, families and friends often fight over who will cover the expense. Payment options on WeChat wallet, left, and Alipay wallet, right. Used by 600 million Chinese, WeChat is similar to WhatsApp but has many more features. One of them, WeChat Wallet, allows people to pay for almost any service by smart phone. The bill splitting function was launched last year. Owned by Chinese Internet giant Tencent, the payment platform competes with Alibaba's Alipay, which is widely used and also boasts a bill splitting function. There's an app for that JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T08:58:03.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
