That was the way it was - there wasn't the money for us to stay in hotels. \"At one point I had a mattress that lost it springs and I was on the floor in the kitchen. The players were having their breakfast and I was lying there. \"The players could see that if I was willing to do it then there was no reason why they couldn't do it for a short period of time. It was good for camaraderie and team spirit.\" Seven years later Whitbread has returned to the island as the inaugural head coach of Puerto Rico FC, the new North American Soccer League team who will begin in the 2016 Fall Season. The Englishman had just been appointed assistant coach at League Two side Barnet FC, working with long-time colleague Martin Allen, when it was announced that Puerto Rico FC had been formed and that New York Knicks superstar Carmelo Anthony would be the team's owner. “I am committed to bring soccer to the next level in Puerto Rico,” Anthony said at the team's launch in June. “To the thousands of fans in Puerto Rico that have been waiting for soccer to come back, I can promise a world-class organization in a world-class league, with a strong social mission to provide kids the opportunity to participate in this growing sport.” Welcome to the football family @carmeloanthony . Good luck! pic.twitter.com/qFGWCLcX4d — Pelé (@Pele) June 11, 2015 Naturally, Whitbread kept his eye on proceedings - especially when his name kept cropping up on social media as a likely candidate to become the club's first head coach. And when he received an email saying that there was interest in Puerto Rico FC in hiring him, there was only one likely outcome. Informing his new employers of his departure was not easy, though. \"I had seen and followed Puerto Rico FC's story - I had been there before and was intrigued as to what was going on,\" Whitbread told the Telegraph in an interview. \"I was in a job - I had returned from Bahrain in May/June time and was working throughout the summer trying to get things ready for Barnet. \"I got an email saying there was interest from Puerto Rico FC and looked into it and things moved swiftly from there. \"The email was from the league. I wanted to know about it straight away and I was put in touch with the management and that's when the dialogue began. \"I'd been there before so my name came up. The league recommended me highly and seen the work I had done there before. I had coached there and done a lot of work in the community. \"When the team was announced, a lot of people on social media asked if I was going back. In my heart I was interested but I didn't push for it. \"Once the interest came there was not much I could do until one morning I woke up to an email saying, 'Congratulations we'd like to offer you the job as head coach of Puerto Rico FC'. \"It was a very difficult conversation to have with Martin Allen but when I told him he said, 'Away you go - you've got to do what's right for you, it's a great opportunity'. Then I had to have that conversation with the chairman as well and they were both gracious in releasing me. \"I had strong affiliation with Puerto Rico but it wasn't just about going back to the island. I knew I would never get this opportunity again to go to a football club and set it up from scratch.\" Please welcome Mr. Adrian Whitbread and Mr. Neil Sillett to the #PRFC team! pic.twitter.com/VQxRoaaFsz — Puerto Rico FC (@PRFootballClub) August 31, 2015 Building a club up from scratch is as hard as it sounds, and alongside technical director Neil Sillett, Whitbread has been working non-stop to scout players, reacquaint himself with the NASL and ensure mistakes of the past are not repeated. The club already have a stadium in place: the recently renovated Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium in Bayamón that also serves as the home base for the Puerto Rico national team. But finding players and setting up trials to form a competitive squad to begin training next spring and then arrange friendlies before kicking off next autumn is proving all-consuming for Whitbread and Sillett, who have been living out of hotels since the summer on the mother of all road trips. \"We've been everywhere since the deal was announced,\" Whitbread adds. \"We started in Puerto Rico and then we've come out to the East Coast and we've been to Tampa, Orlando, Charlston, Atlanta and now Fort Lauderdale. \"We've been meeting people to reassure ourselves we're on the right lines. We're building up a general knowledge of the league. \"We've taken in a lot of games, including college teams.... there's something going on every day. \"The first thing in the morning I check my emails and today there were 32 - sometimes you try to respond to every one. \"We've been inundated with players and agents who was to come to the franchise but obviously there's a process to go through. We've got a long list of players ourselves - some of them are out of contract and some are still under contract. \"It's not ideal moving from hotel to hotel but it needs to be done. We're starting up early in terms of player recruitment and getting the process right but it's part of the job. It's official! #PRFC #NASL pic.twitter.com/o7NpyqWzkr — Puerto Rico FC (@PRFootballClub) June 11, 2015 \"It's not that much different to managers from other parts of the world in the off-season. The only difference is the country is so big, we've had some eight-hour drives. That's given Neil and I a lot of time to talk football! \"We're going back to Puerto Rico later this month for meetings and then we're off again. We've got a full schedule. Late November early December we're planning to have try-outs. \"These are the things you need to do that will put the franchise in good stead.\" He added: \"We met up with the Miami FC coaching staff and technical director out on the road and proved to us that we're doing the right thing. They start in the spring season and they're doing what we're doing but we're probably doing it at an earlier stage.\" Having a core of players from Puerto Rico is important to club - not only to give the supporters heroes to identify with but also to help the national team. \"We've got trials planned - one on the East Coast of the US, one on the West Coast and couple in Puerto Rico as well. You need to have an identity to the team - and you've got to be fair to people on the island. \"They don't just want to come and watch players from other parts of the world, they want to see their own players as well. I know that first-hand, more than anyone else. \"We also want to develop young players for the benefit of the national federation, as well.\" Whitbread and Sillett will allow themselves some down-time and going to watch their new boss in action at Madison Square Garden for the Knicks is high on the list. \"Neil and I have mentioned going to an NBA game when we go up to New York. I've never been but and there's real reason to follow it as our owner is one of the main players.\" Puerto Rico Islanders - A dream come true: https://t.co/pO92jE6UIz — Santiago Pombo (@SpOMBO2010) May 27, 2015 What is important for Whitbread, Sillett, Anthony and everyone else involved in the club is that it is a long-term success. The previous club on the island - Puerto Rico Islanders - had many high points, including reaching the semi-finals of the Concacaf Champions League in 2008. However, long delays to the renovation work on the Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium, an ill-conceived financial arrangement with the then Puerto Rican government and a plummeting economy meant the Islanders were forced to suspend operations in late 2012. But with the stadium complete and Puerto Rican icon - and multi-millionaire - Anthony at the helm, Whitbread is confident that the club will be a huge success. \"The last time round we got a lot of funding from the government. We had an affiliation with the 'blue party' but the 'red party' got into power and they thought that other issues were more important,\" Whitbread adds. \"We were also short-handed in terms of staff and in the last year we didn't have the stadium as it was being renovated - we only had three games there. That didn't help as financially we didn't have people coming through the turnstiles. \"This time Carmelo Anthony has an ability to draw stuff in and I know everyone is working very hard to put all the pieces of the jigsaw in place.\" And one thing can be sure Whitbread will not sleep easy - no matter where his mattress is - until the job is done.
