At a press conference, Domaine Hospitality Partners, LLC, Foursome Development Co., and the City of Pacific Grove , outlined plans for an ocean front luxury hotel venture dubbed Project Bella . The group will be seeking LEED Platinum certification at the site of the American Tin Cannery , on the west end of historic Cannery Row . The hotel will include executive conference and meeting spaces and is now in planning with acclaimed architecture firm Hornberger + Worstell. Down the street from the site of Project Bella, there is an abundance of ocean-side meeting spaces on Cannery Row including at the Intercontinental The Clement Monterey , the Monterey Plaza Hotel and the Monterey Bay Inn .\nIt's just a short stroll along the Monterey Bay Coastal Recreation Trail to the Monterey Beach House - located on the sands of Del Monte Beach , next to Old Fisherman's Wharf . Groups can hear the breakers and experience the wildlife up close where dolphins, whale humps, seals and otters regularly break the surface of the water. The venue offers an array of team building activities such as Beach Olympics, Sand Castle Building, Wacky Relays and Scavenger Hunts, and the beach can be privatized and transformed to suit the needs of any group.\nThe Sanctuary Beach Resort is the only ocean side getaway in Marina . Set in the undulating sand dunes near Marina State Beach and Fort Ord Dunes State Park , the Sanctuary features over 3,000 sq. ft. of indoor meeting space and 6,000 sq. ft. of outdoor space surrounded by the natural beauty and quiet calm of the Central Coast . Attendees can get out of the boardroom and into the great outdoors with easy access to an abundance of adventure options in Marina including Marina Dunes Natural Preserve , a favored spot for paragliding, skydiving, and kite flying where it's common to see colorful patterns of every imaginable shape, size and design soaring over the dunes.\nTake a deep breath of sea air and settle in for some serene relaxation, reflection and rejuvenation at Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove . This 170 acre, ecologically diverse beachfront heritage property surrounded by dazzling natural sand dunes and tide pools. Known as Monterey Peninsula's \"Refuge by the Sea\", the resort offers a variety of meeting and event locations from a protected meadow to a historic chapel to the white sands of Asilomar State Beach , just a short jaunt from Pebble Beach and The Inn at Spanish Bay .\nGroups can complete their trip to Monterey County by exploring the one-of-a-kind experiences found at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The Open Seas Galleries is the Aquarium's largest exhibit, a space where groups can meet across from a 90-foot window into the sea and watch tunas, sharks, turtles and shimmering schools of fish swim by.
