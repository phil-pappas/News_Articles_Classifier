The upgraded edition, which was just launched, offers ICCA members –the leading international meeting suppliers- 25,000 high-potential association meeting ambassadors –10,000 more than before. These local association representatives are likely to be interested in bidding bid for an international association meeting.\nFollowing a recent investment we are very happy to announce that we have now identified 25,000 unique active, high-potential association meeting ambassadors – 10,000 more than before!\nAt ICCA’s 2014 Congress in Antalya last year, ICCA launched an extra sophistication to its original Big Data Search for potential local “meeting ambassadors”, identifying whether professors and academics identified in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search are also featured within the websites of associations and congresses in the selected academic field. This makes them more likely to be involved in the organisation of a new edition of the association’s conference and thus very important contacts to identify for ICCA members.\nThis process initially identified approximately 15,000 high-potential local meeting ambassadors. Since then, new meetings, mainly taking place in 2014 and confirmed for the future, have been added to the ICCA Association Database by ICCA’s Research Department. The additional 10,000 academics have been identified based on association and conference websites of these newly identified meetings.\nICCA CEO Martin Sirk: “By automating the research to see if high-profile academics, as identified with our Big Data Search tool, are actually active with an association and its meetings, we create a shortcut for ICCA members to identify suitable local meeting ambassadors. This should save our members a lot of research time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:29:05.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
