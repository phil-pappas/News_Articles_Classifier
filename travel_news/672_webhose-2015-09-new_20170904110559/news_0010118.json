This anniversary was also a perfect opportunity to pay tribute to Martell's employees and winegrower partners, gathering more than 3 200 guests at the Château de Chanteloup, the birthplace of the House. \nA tribute to Cognac and the people of Cognac \nTo celebrate its 300th anniversary, it was essential for the Martell House to celebrate its origins in Cognac, and in particular in the Château de Chanteloup, which has been refurbished for the event. \nOver 2,500 winegrowers, distillers and other partners from the Cognac region received their invitations from Martell employees, who delivered them personally to mark their special relationship. For a month ahead of the event, they criss-crossed the Charente countryside in Martell-branded trucks to hand-deliver the invitations to partners. \"This is a very special year for Martell, which is celebrating three centuries of cognac-making and close bonds with the people of Cognac. We wanted to invite all the local partners with whom we have nurtured a truly remarkable partnership for nearly ten generations, and I sincerely hope that this special relationship will continue for many generations to come,\" said César Giron, Chairman and CEO of Martell House. \nSpectacular staging for an experience rich in sense & history Guests were treated to a spectacular surprise at the start of the evening when two fighter jets roared across the Cognac sky, followed by three planes from the \"Cartouche Doré\", a squadron of seasoned flight instructors from the French air force flight academy in Cognac. The squadron is considered the \"little brother\" of the famed Patrouille de France aerobatics team, which put on a demonstration for guests during the 20 May event in Versailles. Two Cap Ten aerobatic planes then wrote out the number \"300\" in white smoke before dropping three parachutists - carrying some flags marked with Martell colours - who joined the guests and presented César Giron & Alexandre Ricard with bottles of the limited edition cognac given to guests as a gift. \nThis exceptional 40-minute airshow -a tribute to a shared history anchored in savoir-faire, excellence and passion - was crowned by a stunning fireworks display to set the stage for a grandiose evening in an amazing setting. \nAn ode to Cognac culinary excellence \nIn an enchanting decor reminiscent of Versailles, guests had the chance to enjoy cocktails created especially for Martell's 300th anniversary by Thierry Hernandez (head barman at the famous Plaza Athenée). The 3,200 guests shared a custom-crafted culinary experience developed in collaboration with the Château de Chanteloup's chefs Eric Danger and Pascal Nebout. The menu featured delectable gastronomical specialties from the region with an emphasis on local seasonal products, as well as contemporary takes on recipes dating from 1715. \nAfter being warmly thanked for their contribution to Martell, they danced late into the night. The concert was punctuated by the unexpected arrival of French singer-songwriter Louis Bertignac (a founding member of the group Telephone), a friend of the House who couldn't resist a chance to play several of his hits. \nAn exceptional limited edition reserved for Martell partners Because the Tricentenaire of Martell is above all an opportunity to celebrate 300 years of craftsmanship and excellence, each guest received an exclusive limited edition cognac, a blend of fifteen eaux-de-vie from the five main crus, spanning the last three centuries. \"The blending of these 15 eaux-de-vie, which then completed their ageing in barrels made from 300-year-old oak, spotlights our savoir-faire, our commitment, and our attachment to a House that has let us continue a fabulous story that began in 1715.\" notes Martell Cellar Master, Benoît Fil. \nMARTELL AND THE FRENCH AIR FORCE: A PROUD SHARED HISTORY \nIn 1936, Paul Firino-Martell, the mayor of Cognac, donated a château to the French Air Force to be used as the seat of a charitable foundation. Shortly thereafter he initiated the construction of an air base in Cognac, donating land near the village of Châteaubernard, establishing the foundations of two pioneers of French expertise and excellence, the Martell House and what became a showpiece of the French Air Force's prowess. \nFrench Air Force training base 709 in Cognac is home to the Air Force pilot academy (EPPA), and is where future fighter and transport pilots learn to fly. \nThe pilots of the Cartouche Doré aerobatics team are all instructors at this French Air Force academy. They fly in trios at the controls of the TB30 Epsilon aircraft, demonstrating the skills of fighter pilots with panache, brilliantly combining exacting professionalism and technical performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:38:04.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
