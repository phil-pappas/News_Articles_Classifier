Two pieces of Völkl technology contribute: the UVO (Ultimate Vibration Object), which sits on the topsheet and takes care of dampening, and the 3D.Ridge, running up the centre of the ski, providing precise power transmission. While they prefer hard snow, they're also fairly versatile, offering a decent platform for big turns off piste. Like many of these \"mid-fat\" skis, their short turns aren't quite as strong as their long ones. Tech talk \nSidewall construction, with a wood core that is strengthened with steel.

To achieve this, most of them have medium waist widths, falling mainly into the 85–100 mm range. Atomic Vantage 90 CTI W \n£480 Best for: Aspiring freeriders \nStrong, stable skis, these Vantages are fun in soft snow, cutting through crud and floating through powder. On piste, they grip well, and have no obvious weaknesses, although do not score as highly as many of their rivals – apart, that is, from in moguls, where they are best of this. They would be well suited to someone looking to make their first forays into freeride terrain. Tech talk \nPartial cap construction with full sidewalls underfoot. Poplar wood core, strengthened with titanium and a woven carbon mesh.
