Owned by Kiroro Resort Holdings Co., Ltd., the hotel is located at the Kiroro Resort in Western Hokkaido, Japan – one of the world’s best powder skiing destinations. Bringing the brand’s Stay Independent vision to Japan’s second largest island, The Kiroro is part of a dual signing with the Sheraton Hokkaido Kiroro Resort, both of which are scheduled to open in December 2015. \n“We are thrilled to continue Starwood’s expansion in Asia Pacific with not only our newest brand, Tribute Portfolio, but also our most global brand, Sheraton,” said Dave Marr, Global Brand Leader, Sheraton Hotels & Resorts and Tribute Portfolio. “The Kiroro Resort is a magnificent ski destination, and we look forward to working closely with Mr. Adhyanasakul and his team to create memorable experiences for our guests over many seasons to come.” Located at the base of the ski mountain, The Kiroro, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel, Hokkaido features 282 spacious guest rooms and suites, and offers travellers on-site recreational facilities, including a gym and swimming pool. In addition to a wide number of nearby dining options, the hotel features four different restaurant and bar destinations where guests can savour a variety of international cuisines, from authentic Italian dishes at the hotel’s signature restaurant, to casual buffet and a la carte dining at the hotel's cafe. The hotel also has more than 1,400 square meters of function space, including a grand ballroom and four meeting rooms. “We are pleased to forge this dynamic partnership with Starwood Hotels and Resorts, combining our local market expertise with Starwood’s formidable brand equity and its powerful guest loyalty program,” said Chainid Adhyanasakul, CEO of Kiroro Resort Holdings Co., Ltd. “We are confident that our synergy is poised for long term success, and we look forward to starting the new ski season together.” The Kiroro is situated in the heart of the Kiroro integrated mountain resort area, only a few minutes away from the Sheraton Hokkaido Kiroro Resort, approximately 90 minutes from New Chitose Airport, the largest airport in Hokkaido, or a 40 minute ride from the city of Otaru via a free shuttle service. Known for its superb powder skiing with 21 well-groomed trails suitable for all levels, the Kiroro Resort features mogul courses, a children’s snow park, a ski academy, snow shoe tours and snow cat tours. The Kiroro Resort also boasts modern facilities, relatively uncrowded pistes and a wealth of year-round amenities, including hot springs and a gaming centre. “We are excited to premiere Starwood’s 10th brand in Asia Pacific, only months after its launch,” said Rajit Sukumaran, Senior Vice President, Acquisition & Development at Starwood Hotels & Resorts Asia Pacific. “The Kiroro exemplifies the Tribute Portfolio brand’s independent spirit, geared for all travellers who value unexpected experiences and destinations.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:02:13.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
