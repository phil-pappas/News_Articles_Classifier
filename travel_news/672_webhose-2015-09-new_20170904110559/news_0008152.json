It was expected to open in 2017 but that could be postponed even further.\nThe building authority for the Dahme-Spreewald locality said it had told the construction firm to \"immediately stop building works for the area underneath the entire terminal roof of the BER airport\" until security checks could be carried out by engineers.\nGerman aviation magazine, airportzentrale.de reports that the latest problem has led to Brandenburg’s CEO Karsten Muhlenfeld leaving the company.\nIn a statement, the airport authority said, “There is no question we are currently in a difficult phase of the project. However we will proceed without compromise.”\nEarlier this year Air Berlin, which is currently running at a loss, reached a settlement with the airport over the delays as it had planned on making BER its main hub airport.\nSign up to BBT’s twice-weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T14:21:50.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
