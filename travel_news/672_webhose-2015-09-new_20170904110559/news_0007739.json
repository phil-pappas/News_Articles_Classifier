The island’s Minister was appealing to the population of Seychellois to put its money where its mouth is and to live their culture to the fullest. \n24th October this year will see the Official Opening of the Festival Kreol in Victoria, and it is confirmed that many Creole islands have now said that they will be represented at the 2015 Festival Kreol. “The festival is this year celebrating its 30th anniversary. Seychelles was very far sighted 30 years ago when it organised its first Festival Kreol. It was also soon after this that Seychelles moved to make Victoria, the Kreol Capital of the World, but as the host country we still have work to do to get the population at large to stand behind their biggest cultural celebration. What is meant is that celebrating our culture cannot be in hide away places but instead everyone should come out and be seen to be living our culture” said Minister St.Ange, the Minister responsible for Culture in the islands.
