Hyundai is the only manufacturer in the U.S. currently offering consumers the opportunity to lease a mass-produced fuel cell vehicle, the zero-emissions Tucson Fuel Cell CUV. Since its launch in June 2014 , Tucson Fuel Cell drivers have accumulated nearly 700,000 zero-emissions miles on the streets of Southern California Tucson Fuel Cell Zero-Emissions , helping improve air quality in the region. Hyundai has delivered more than 75 Tucson Fuel Cells since its introduction as the first mass-produced fuel cell vehicle in the U.S. market in June 2014 .\n\"Keyes Hyundai is thrilled to be added as a qualified dealer for Hyundai's zero-emissions Tucson Fuel Cell hydrogen electric vehicle,\" said David Kohan , general manager, Keyes Hyundai. \"Our location in the northern Los Angeles region makes it even more convenient for local residents to conveniently acquire their new Tucson Fuel Cell CUV, helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"\n\"Hyundai is proud to add Keyes Hyundai to its growing collection of approved zero-emissions Tucson Fuel Cell dealers,\" said Dave Zuchowski , president and CEO, Hyundai Motor America. \" Keyes adds a convenient location in the northern Los Angeles region to better serve our fuel cell customers in Southern California .\"\nNewest Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell Dealer: Keyes Hyundai in Los Angeles\nKeyes Hyundai joins existing Hyundai Fuel Cell dealers Tustin Hyundai, Win Hyundai in Carson and Hardin Hyundai in Anaheim , for a total of four qualified fuel cell dealers in Southern California . To become a qualified Hyundai Fuel Cell dealer, approved dealers must fulfill significant additional hydrogen fuel cell requirements in both customer service and technical services.\nTUCSON FUEL CELL ADVANTAGES\nThe Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell CUV has a number of advantages over some other alternative fuels. The energy-rich hydrogen fuel provides an estimated driving range of 265 miles between fill-ups, similar to many gasoline vehicles. Further, both fuel cell driving range and vehicle performance are minimally affected by either extreme hot or cold ambient temperatures, giving owners an extra measure of peace of mind as they go about their day. Even more important for consumers transitioning from gasoline vehicles, the Tucson Fuel Cell can be refilled with hydrogen in about the same time as a typical gasoline vehicle of the same size.\nFinally, fuel cell vehicles, due to their compact, relatively lightweight fuel cell stack design, are completely production scalable from very small to very large vehicles, such as urban-focused mini-compact cars all the way to full-size buses and trucks.\nHYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA\nHyundai Motor America, headquartered in Fountain Valley, Calif. , is a subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Co. of Korea.
