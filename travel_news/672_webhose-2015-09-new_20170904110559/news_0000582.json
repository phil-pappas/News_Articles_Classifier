It’s often the very first thing we share with a new business associate, and it can influence the impression they form of us. According to a recent poll by Crowne Plaza® Hotels & Resorts, 22 per cent of people believe a “solid handshake” is the most important factor in creating a good impression in business. It’s worth having a view of the etiquette , therefore, so that you can impress from the get-go. Read the guide below to ensure your handshake passes muster. Choose the right approach Before extending your hand, make eye contact with the person you’re greeting and offer them a smile. That will ensure they don’t ignore you, which could leave you red-faced. Then, be sure to offer your hand in an open gesture. Don’t come in at an angle, because it could come across as either too domineering or too submissive. And try to make sure you palm isn’t sweaty or wet from holding a drink when you offer it. A damp handshake does not a good impression make. Aim for palm-to-palm contact A good handshake involves the web of skin between your thumb and forefinger interlocking with the same part of your associate’s hand. That will ensure you have the right grip, and prevent you from doing an awkward finger-shake that makes you seem inexperienced and unsure of yourself. Be firm, but don’t clench This is the crucial part. A limp shake comes across as nervous and meek, so confidence is key. But resist the urge to crush the hand shakee’s fingers beneath your grip. As the Crowne Plaza® Hotel & Resorts research shows, it’s important to have a “solid” grasp, but no one wants to feel as if they’ve put their hand in a vice after meeting you. Take special care if the person you’re greeting is older or frail. One shake or two – and definitely no more than three The clue’s in the name, isn’t it? A brief shake is important in establishing a connection. If not, your greeting just becomes a hand-hold, which is something different entirely. But don’t shake in too large an arc, or for too long. A brief up-and-down movement, no more than three times, will be just the ticket. And unless you know the person well, resist the urge to smother the back of their hand with your free palm. That can quickly feel like an invasion of personal space. Remember to let go It sounds silly, but you need to let go. The trick is to do so at the same moment as your companion. Normally, you’ll feel one another’s grip start to loosen and can withdraw from your handshake simultaneously. Whatever happens, don’t continue your conversation with their hand still in yours. It’ll make them feel awkward. Besides, there may well be other people for both of you to greet – and thanks to your well-honed handshaking habits, you’ll be sure to make a good impression on all of them. Face-to-face connections are key to successful business relationships.
