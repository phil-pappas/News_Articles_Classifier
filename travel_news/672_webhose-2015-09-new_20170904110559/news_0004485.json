Passengers can now operate those devices during flight, as long as they are set to airplane mode. Ad Feedback \nBut the rules still don't allow passengers to use cellphones to make calls or send text messages during takeoff and flight. \n\"The concern is that anything that emits a signal may interfere with the avionic/electrical systems in the cockpit,\" an FAA spokesperson wrote. \nTillman, a patent attorney, said his own smartphone was set to airplane mode when he took the video of the texting pilot. \nOn previous flights, he said, attendants have told him to turn his cellphone off. So he said he was initially annoyed - and later disturbed - to see a pilot ignoring the rules. \n\"I started thinking, 'They've got these rules in place for a reason,'\" Tillman said. \" ... The pilots, more than anyone, should know those rules and obey them.\" \nTNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T23:57:21.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
