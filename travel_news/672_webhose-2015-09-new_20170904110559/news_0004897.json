Michael made an immediate impact on Sam.

Sam and myself were there for the right reasons and when you’re on the same page it just works. It was a really incredible experience.”\nSo wait a minute, does that mean Sam will stay with him forever?\nHe’s playing coy.

In terms of being a top contender or frontrunner, I don’t know about that, but I certainly felt quite comfortable with her.”\nBut don’t think that cocktail parties, elaborate dates and hanging out with 14 guys in a mansion is a walk in the park.\nMichael says it was very hard emotionally on the men and even thinks the guys have a rougher time dealing with the challenges of the dating show environment than the girls.\n“Guys find it just as hard but they hide it,” he said. “When we are smiling and laughing, inside we could be stressing but we hold it in, whereas girls might let it out with a few tears.

You’d normally talk about that five or six months into a relationship, not with someone you’ve just met. That’s the challenge and the fact that you’ve got 13 other guys looking over your shoulder doesn’t make it any easier.”\nSo now that he’s bared his soul to the nation, what do his football mates think of him signing up to a reality show and getting all gushy about his quest to find love?\n“I’ve had so much support and encouragement, not just from my football mates, but everyone, they’ve all said ‘good on you for putting yourself out there and saying what you want’, it’s not easy in the real world let alone in that type of environment.\n“I think all the boys deserve a pat on the back on back for putting themselves out there and going for it. It’s not easy.” Michael in one of his more dreamy moments.
