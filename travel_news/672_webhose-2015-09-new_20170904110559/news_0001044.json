Taking place all through September, there are three consecutive events in the capital: perfect for both advanced connoisseurs and beginners. \nTell Me About All Of Them! \nThe Festival of the Grape Harvest is held at Prague’s Botanical Gardens, on the outskirts of the capital. It celebrates local winemaking and allows you try various wines produced in the surrounding areas, while live music and food stalls will entertain you into the evening. \nPrague Castle hosts the Festival of the Grape & Wine Tasting, which commemorates harvest season. With many different types of wine available, you will discover new thirst-quenchers such as Bur ák, a partially fermented young 'not-quite' wine. \nLast but not least, there is the Saint Wenceslas Vines Festival at the very end of September. Its chosen accompaniments for wine tasting are knightly contests and live music – making for the perfect pre-dinner entertainment. \nDo I Really Have to Leave? \nUnfortunately, all good things must come to an end.
