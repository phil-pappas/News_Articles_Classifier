Coupled with San Jose’s 3-2 loss at New York City, the Sounders are now five points clear of the playoff cutoff line with four matches remaining.\nTheir late-season leveling off has taken place with Pineda edged out of the picture. Prior to last Saturday’s draw against the Earthquakes, the veteran midfielder had started just one match since early July.\nMatch stats\nNagging injuries hadn’t helped his status, nor had the glut of new signings during the summer transfer window. But Erik Friberg was hurt at practice on Friday and Pineda lined up alongside Osvaldo Alonso in midfield, with captain Brad Evans out wide and Zach Scott replacing injured Roman Torres in defense.\nScott knows the drill.\n“It always seems like around this time, that’s when I start playing again,” Scott said. “That’s all I can worry about, just being right there on the cusp, pushing the guys in front of you, and when you get an opportunity, take it and run. Gonzo (Pineda) is the same way. All the veterans are the same way.”\nPineda’s moment came with less than 20 minutes remaining of a game that had been tilted toward Seattle’s penalty box.\nThe first half had been cautiously optimistic.\nVancouver likes to sit back, lull teams into a false sense of security then bite them on the counterattack. That strategy has paid dividends: Despite averaging one of the lowest possession totals in MLS, the Whitecaps entered the weekend in first place in the Supporters’ Shield standings.\nBut when opponents hesitate to commit numbers, wary of giving the ’Caps too much space, their games get stagnant.\nThe game was moping lazily toward halftime when Martins picked out Andreas Ivanschitz with a pinpoint pass in front of goal, the Austrian playmaker setting it with a touch before finishing past Whitecaps ’keeper David Ousted. Ivanschitz, too, has suffered through a long summer, first training on his own to stay sharp and getting injured almost as soon as Seattle signed him.\nVancouver pressed higher in the second half, peppering Frei with shots. Seattle didn’t keep the ball for very long but looked potent on the break while it did.\nMartins and Dempsey started finding each other, foreshadowing the final dagger to come, when Martins put the finishing touch on Dempsey’s muscle-flexing surge through the Whitecaps’ back line.\nBut an all-important insurance tally eluded the Sounders until the moment Pineda found Martins in the 71st minute. Martins picked out substitute Nelson Valdez, who knocked it back to Dempsey with a deft touch. Dempsey played it to Pineda, who patiently waited for an opening.\nPineda’s curler bounced off the left post on the way in, and he sprinted toward the corner to celebrate with his teammates.\nPineda, one of those team-always-comes-first vets, then stole a moment for himself. Strolling toward midfield, he looked upward at the underside of the closed BC Place roof and spread his arms as if in prayer.\n“I was thinking about my family,” Pineda said. “Sometimes, when I’m not playing and I’m not happy, that happens the same at home. I’m not in a good mood, sometimes, with my family, and they’re always supporting me to get my head clean. I just wanted to say thank you.”\nCascadia Cup winners The Cascadia Cup goes to the head-to-head winner among the three Northwest MLS teams each year.
