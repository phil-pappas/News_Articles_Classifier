In August, they presented their first two programs in partnership with the American Technion Society, a U.S. non-profit organization that raises funds for Israel's leading high-tech university, the Technion. Both programs took place at the Mission Viejo Country Club. Deputy Platoon Commander Aviv Regev, and Prof. Wayne Kaplan, the Technion University Executive Vice President for Research, met with members of the Orange County community. The brunch meetings on August 9 and 23 were sponsored by SetSchedule in partnership with the American Technion Society, and took place over brunch at Mission Viejo Country Club. The first of the programs was on Sunday, August 9, and featured Deputy Platoon Commander Aviv Regev of the Israel Defense Forces, who has been traveling throughout the U.S. promoting the documentary film \"Beneath the Helmet.\" The film is a coming of age story that follows the lives of five high school graduates who are drafted into the Israeli army through their first months of training. In the film, one observes these young individuals as they undergo a demanding and inspiring journey, revealing the core of who they are and who they want to be. The attending guests were deeply moved, and engaged in an extended Q & A with Regev, who, all of 22 years himself, was the commanding officer of the five young soldiers. In October, he will begin his studies at the Technion where he will be seeking a double major in Physics and Mathematics. On Sunday, August 23, Technion Professor Wayne Kaplan presented a detailed overview of how research at the Technion advances from the laboratory to the marketplace. Prof. Kaplan, the university's Executive Vice President for Research, also discussed the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers from different faculties in achieving significant scientific breakthroughs. Prof. Kaplan also spoke of the Electron Microscopy Center at the Technion where several important microscopes are maintained. One of them, the Titan, is among the most powerful electron microscopes in the world and the only one of its kind in the Middle East. This particular microscope is at the core of all nanotechnology-related research for both the university and industry throughout Israel. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:21:47.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
