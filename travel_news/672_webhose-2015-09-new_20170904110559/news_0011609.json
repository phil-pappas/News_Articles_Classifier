It’s good if you own a house, but it’s terrible if you want one or you are trying to pay one off.”\nSydney’s heated property market is already experiencing ‘unprecedented’ demand from Chinese investors. Source: News Corp Australia\nWorld markets plunged overnight as more evidence emerged of China’s economic slowdown, with the Australian market following suit by opening one per cent lower this morning, when the benchmark S & P/ASX200 index was down 51.9 points at 5,044.5.\nThe Chinese government yesterday revealed last month’s manufacturing index was at its lowest point in three years, prompting sell-offs in the United States, Europe and Australia.\nThe latest data, revealed today, shows Australia’s economy grew a slower-than-expected 0.2 per cent in the three months through June, dragged down by waning Chinese demand for resources including iron ore and coal.\nAnd the Australian dollar today dropped to 70 US cents, its lowest since 2009.\nHowever, it’s not all bad news; despite slowing down, the Australian economy is in its 25th year of continuous growth.\nMr Chovanec said Australia had an opportunity to tap into China’s consumer market for things like food, kicking off an “overdue and much needed adjustment” in our export focus.\nThe Australia-China Free Trade Agreement, signed last year and currently pending ratification by Parliament, will open up a huge new market for our horticulture, agriculture, wine, dairy, wool and beef industries.\n“Some decline in the Australian dollar is helpful in facilitating that, but it’s not painless,” Mr Chovanec said.\n“China’s ability to consume — to provide end user demand, not intermediate demand like the demand for iron ore — that’s what the world should care about, and that’s what the adjustment is about.”\nConstruction has slowed dramatically in China, weakening demand for iron ore from our biggest export market.

That’s not a functioning market.”\nA Chinese journalist made to apologise on live television for “causing” the crash had merely reported that “the Chinese government was considering no longer making share purchases to support the market; this week, the official news is exactly that.”\nMr Chovanec said while people assumed China’s control of its economy was strong, many did not realise how much it had transformed in recent years, with an “explosion in non-bank lending” and margin lending accounting for as much as a quarter of share market trades.\nChina’s financial system is undergoing dramatic change. Picture: Bloomberg Source: Supplied\n“China’s financial system is almost unrecognisable compared to four or five years ago,” Mr Chovanec said.\n“We don’t know what we don’t know about China’s shadow banking system, and how they’re tied to bank balance sheets. I’m not predicting it will unravel, but I think this is why they intervened — because they do not know what will happen ... The question is, what happens when people default? Well, they didn’t want to find out.”\nMeanwhile, a US Treasury official said Washington’s key focus in the meeting of G20 economy chiefs in Ankara later this week would be to press for action to boost global demand, and to urge Beijing authorities to better communicate their policies for shoring up the economy and markets.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey said the Australian economy was more resilient than other resource-reliant economies and that a slowdown in mine construction was being offset by increases in the building and services industries.\nHe said 3.7 per cent annual economic growth in the June quarter in the United States left Australia “relatively well positioned for any unexpected weakness in China”.\n“The transition away from a reliance on mining investment is well underway,” Mr Hockey said.\n Why China’s crash puts us at risk", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australia-is-uniquely-vulnerable-to-chinas-economic-downturn-with-exports-and-even-housing-affordability-at-risk/story-fnu2pwk8-1227509613446", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/02/1227509/613340-23e7735a-5135-11e5-af2f-e6e8604c3982.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/02/1227509/613392-7ba18a9e-5136-11e5-af2f-e6e8604c3982.jpg", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/09/02/1227509/613604-05b8cdfc-5135-11e5-af2f-e6e8604c3982.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-03T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T14:56:33.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
