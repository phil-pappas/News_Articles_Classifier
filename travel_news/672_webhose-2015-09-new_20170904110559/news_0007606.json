It is a great opportunity for Louvre Hotels Group to benefit from this 5-year roadmap, enabling continuous investment to accelerate development in France, Europe, Asia and the rest of the world. The new ownership also gives LHG access to the largest outbound touristic market of which 30% is managed by Jin Jiang Tour Operator. \nLHG and Jin Jiang share the same passion for the hotel industry. Prior to the acquisition of Louvre hotels Group by Jin Jiang in March 2015, the two companies had been partnering for 4 years with a distribution agreement. \nBoosting expansion with a EUR2.5 billion line of credit \nThe development is now receiving a strong boost. Strengthened by the €2.5b line of credit granted by Chinese bank ICBC over a 3-year term, a substantial enough budget is available to shift gears and accelerate the development strategy of the Group through organic development, innovations, renovation of existing hotels, or external growth. \nAccelerating brands' development into the Chinese market \nWith the Chinese shareholder's backing, the brands are able to penetrate a market with high entry barriers. Louvre Hotels Group will launch Campanile economy hotels in China, with first opening in Shanghai at the end of 2015. The objective is 500 hotels in the next 5 years. \nFurther development is planned for the Golden Tulip brand: among the first, the conversion of a flagship JJ hotel in Shanghai. \nStrengthening presence in Thailand , Indonesia and South East Asia \nThailand In Thailand the group currently has 5 Golden Tulip and Royal Tulip Hotels in operation and development. There are currently advanced plans for the launch and a roll out of a group of 30 Tulip Inn economy hotels, economy hotels throughout the Kingdom, in the main and secondary cities around the country. \nFurthermore there are aggressive plans for further expansion for the 5 and 4 star hotels and resorts in the main destinations Bangkok, Phuket and Pattaya.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:37:55.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
