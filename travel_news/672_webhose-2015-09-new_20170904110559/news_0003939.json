In another potential sign of an increasing Russian role, President Vladimir Putin agreed to a deal with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday aimed at avoiding incidents in Syria.\nA \"joint mechanism for preventing misunderstandings between our forces\" was agreed to, Mr Netanyahu’s office said.\nIsraeli forces have reportedly carried out several strikes in Syria on Iranian arms transfers to Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah.\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:04:02.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
