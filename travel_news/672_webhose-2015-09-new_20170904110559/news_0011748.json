A narrow three-storey building, it offers two bedrooms sleeping four, with further accommodation possible on a sofa bed. The small kitchen is equipped with a host of gadgets, pots and plastic plates for young children. Décor is quietly pleasing but not dauntingly stylish; complete with wood-burner in the sitting room, this is a very cosy and relaxing cottage. Cleeveley Cottage, Holwell Location: 8/10 Cleeveley Cottage sits in the single row of pretty properties that makes up the hamlet of Holwell, with rolling farmland on the doorstep. Burford, with its cafes and historic inns, is three and a half miles north; the Cotswold Wildlife Park, of great family appeal, is half a mile east; the Cotswold Water Park, with its aquatic activities, is eight miles south. Style & character: 7/10 Roses grow over the front door of this Grade II-listed 16th-century cottage. The three-storey stone building is simply furnished and very cosy - the sort of place you can really relax in without being intimidated by stylish fittings. Cleeveley Cottage, Holwell The ground floor is essentially one room; a sitting room with a wood-burner set in a handsome stone fireplace gives on to a dining area and kitchen. The master bedroom and bathroom are up a set of spiral stairs. Open what looks like a landing cupboard door onto more spiral stairs, which lead to the top floor with a twin-bedded room, loo, and sitting area with a sofa bed. This floor is a bit cut off for small children, but it offers an ideal degree of independence for nines and up. Facilities: 7/10 The kitchen is small but well-equipped, with plastic plates for the very young. In-house entertainment ranges from board games to televisions in the sitting room, the master bedroom and top-floor sitting area. There’s a barbecue and outdoor seating in the enclosed gravel garden, which is a practical, rather than prettily planted, space. Free Wi-Fi. Cleeveley Cottage, Holwell Value for money: 8/10 Cleeveley Cottage’s tranquillity comes at a reasonable price for the Cotswolds: from £495 per week in low season; rising to £799 in high (short breaks from £322 available in low and medium season). Family friendly: 8/10 A travel cot, high chair and stair gate can be supplied. However, the spiral stairs, although reasonably wide, might be off-putting for those with toddlers. This is probably a better bet for slightly older children who can enjoy the freedom of charging around outside in an almost traffic-free environment. Eating Head into Burford for basic food supplies from the Co-op and for local specialities from The Cotswold Cheese Company, or drive to Morrisons at Carterton, or Sainsbury’s and Waitrose at Witney. Eating out options include the highly praised Five Alls at Filkins and the Swan at Southrop. Access for guests with disabilities Because of its age and layout, the property is not accessible to those with limited mobility.
