Since then, Australia has cemented its reputation as a wine-producing powerhouse and today the UK sells more wine off trade from Australia than from any other wine-producing nation. It’s not just the signature shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varieties that win top awards. Ambitious Aussie wineries are cultivating lesser-known grapes and crafting spectacular blends to tease the palate. With so many wines to choose from, it can be hard to know where to start. Do you want to taste the Mediterranean climate of the Barossa Valley in South Australia? Or a vintage from coastal Margaret River, in Western Australia, where viniculture meets surf culture to create an amazing holiday blend? If you want to bring a taste of Australia home, why not try some of these wines? None of them costs more than £20 a bottle and all are readily available at a variety of outlets. From fresh Margaret River semillon sauvignon to a sweet moscato from South Australia, they will delight and surprise you. In fact, after a glass or two, you may be inspired to head Down Under yourself and try a few, while touring Australia’s spectacular vineyards.
