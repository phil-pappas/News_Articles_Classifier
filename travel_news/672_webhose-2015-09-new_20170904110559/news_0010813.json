Waze users can update the app in real-time to mark jams, speed cameras and road works, as well as add more detail to the map itself.\nBut the lawsuit from rival app PhantomAlert alleges that some of Waze’s database was lifted wholesale in 2010. PhantomAlert cites as evidence the presence of non-existent points of interest in Waze’s database, which it says could only have come from its own data.\nThe complaint states : “Among other methods, PhantomAlert determined that Waze had copied its Points of Interest database by observing the presence of fictitious Points of Interest in the Waze application, which PhantomAlert had seeded into its own database for the purpose of detecting copying.\n“On information and belief, Waze copied the PhantomAlert database on multiple occasions after late 2012, re-incorporated the copied data into the Waze application, and continued to display the Points of Interest data to the users of the Waze application.”\nPhantomAlert’s evidence is a modern version of “trap streets” or “paper towns” – fictitious locations put into maps by cartographers to guard against copying. In older editions of London’s A-Z street map, for example, a walkway named “Bartlett Place” exists; any map using that name, rather than the actual name, Broadway Walk, must have gathered its data by illegally copying the atlas.\nSome mapmakers avoid trap streets, in an effort to maintain the accuracy of their information. Instead, they rely on stylistic features such as the style of their icons, or the width of roads, to identify rip-off merchants. In 2001, the AA was forced to pay £20m to the UK’s Ordnance Survey after a team of experts identified “fingerprints” that proved that their maps were the source of the AA’s information.\nPhantomAlert’s lawyer, Karl Kronenberger, said that the information was used to justify Waze’s sale to Google. “Waze needed to grow its database to increase its value and become more attractive to potential acquirers,” he said in a statement. “Our complaint alleges that Waze stole PhantomAlert’s database when Waze could not get it legally, and then sold itself to Google for over $1bn.”\nThe lawsuit seeks monetary damages as well as an injunction requiring Google to “cease operating the Waze website and application”.", "external_links": ["http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/09/traffic-app-phantomalert-claims-waze-stole-its-database-files-lawsuit/"], "published": "2015-09-03T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:46:17.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
