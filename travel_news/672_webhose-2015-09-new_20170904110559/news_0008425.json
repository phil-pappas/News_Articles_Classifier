After all customers are increasingly interested in sustainability, which is a great thing for UK Hospitality.\nThe hospitality industry is increasingly playing its part in reducing waste, and in particular food waste. With the upcoming Hospitality and Food Service Agreement (HaFSA) target of a reduction of food packaging waste by 5% and sending 70% of food waste for anaerobic digestion by December 2015, we are more than ever in support of the pledge made by BHA Chief Executive Ufi Ibrahim at the official HaFSA launch in 2012:\n“The BHA is committed to working in partnership with government supporting its aim to reduce waste from food and associated packaging on a voluntary basis in hospitality and foodservice businesses. The hospitality industry and its supply chain have already made significant progress in improving its environmental performance and we are pleased to be working with DEFRA, the Devolved Administrations and WRAP on this long-term journey to increase waste prevention and recycling rates.”\nThe BHA has been seeking ways to encourage businesses to cut waste which is why we have created a partnership with SWR and Winnow Solutions. SWR is an innovative waste management company which creates tailored waste management services for hospitality businesses helping businesses improve their environmental performance, and Winnow Solutions provide a service for busy kitchens which can help cut food waste in half by making it quick and easy to record exactly what is being wasted through a smart meter.\nKeep checking our website and social media pages to stay up to date on great tips to reducing your business waste.\nSource:- British Hospitality Association", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T01:03:28.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
