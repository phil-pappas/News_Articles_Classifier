You’ve put the wrong fuel in your car and now you don’t know what to do. It’s fair to say you feel a bit silly, and worse, you’ve heard that it can be a very costly mistake. But you should take heart from the fact that you’re by no means alone. The AA says that approximately 150,000 motorists each year put petrol in a diesel car, or diesel in a petrol-powered vehicle. And while it’s not the most sensible course of action, it’s by no means irredeemable. The most common causes of mis-fuelling are lack of familiarity with the vehicle you’re driving... Indeed, the AA says its specialist Fuel Assist technicians can get you on the road again in 99 per cent of situations. Which means there’s no need to panic if you mis-fuel your car, van or motorcycle. Just call the organisation’s hotline and one of its technicians will come to your aid. The most common causes of mis-fuelling are lack of familiarity with the vehicle you’re driving, or becoming distracted at the pump. That explains why many incidents occur with rental cars, though it’s by no means uncommon to get in a fix with your own set of wheels.

Mis-fuelling is easily rectified by draining the tank, which the AA does with a specialist van that stores the unwanted fuel on board. But the minute you turn the ignition, it pumps fuel towards the engine, which makes it harder to put right. And if the power plant actually fires up, it can cost many thousands of pounds to repair. That’s why it’s vital to stay calm, and rely on the AA’s experts. They’ll be with you in no time, and aim to have you up and running again within two hours. There’s no need for this simple mistake to prove too costly. Simply put your trust in the AA... The Fuel Assist specialists know how to drain your tank safely, removing every last drop before you refill it with the right fuel and drive away. The service is available on an appointment basis between 6am and 11pm, seven days a week, but you can call the contact number around the clock. There’s no need for this simple mistake to prove too costly. Simply put your trust in the AA, as 14.5 million people around the country do, and you’ll soon be back on the road, with nothing but a red face to show for the experience. Contact the AA’s Fuel Assist team by calling 0800 072 7420 or 0121 535 7479.
