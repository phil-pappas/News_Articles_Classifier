If you must have a fifth floor non-smoking king with a view of the pool, it might take a while to juggle things around to find you one. Stick with the same hotel on each stay. It won't always work, but in many cases, you'll be in the system's guest history. Join the hotel brand's loyalty program. Much of the information will already be kept on file: all the clerk has to do is enter the loyalty program number. The reason loyalty programs exist is to collect, store, properly route, and analyse guest information. Make your reservation in advance. They'll already have much of the information in place when you show up.\nLodging a piece of paper in the peep hole is a good solution to ensuring your safety, if you think it has been broken\nCheck the peep hole\nIt may not be the first thing you think of when you enter your room, but inspect the door's peep hole when you arrive.\nIf it has been damaged or tampered with, Forrest Jones advises asking for a different room.\nRemember, ESPN's Erin Andrews was filmed while she was naked in 2009 by a stalker who removed the peephole from her hotel door.\nJones said: 'After you check your peephole to make sure it's not damaged, missing or tampered with, find a piece of notepaper, tear off a strip of it, roll it up and twist it until it's about the size of a cigarette butt, and 'plug' it in the peephole.'\nMake sure it is not lodged in too deeply so it can be removed when you check-out of your room.\nHow do they work out prices for each room\nZeev Sharon, CEO & Co-Founder of Hotelied, said on Quora : 'The old industry rule of thumb is that for every $1,000 invested in a room's construction, the hotel should charge $1 in average daily rate.\n'So a room that cost $300,000 to build, should sell on average for $300/night.'\nSharon explained that the quality of a room can be determined by the fixtures in a bathroom, the most expensive area to build in guest rooms.\n'A standard three-fixture bathroom has a sink, bath and toilet, a five-fixture bathroom is more typical for luxury hotels, and has two sinks, a bath, stand-alone shower and a toilet,' he said.\nSome hotels use a UV wand or back light to check for germs that the eye alone cannot see\nThere is a protocol for when people die in their room\nTomsky, who worked in two top hotels in New Orleans and New York City, admitted to MailOnline Travel that deaths in hotels are not quite as rare as guests may think.\n'It's not something a hotel wishes to publicise, naturally,' he explained. 'So, they are removed as discreetly as possible.\n'This may involve flashing lights and paramedics, depending on the severity of the situation, but can also happen via employee elevators and back exits.'\nHe added: 'Death is a part of hotel life.'\nIf a death occurs, once the person is removed, the room is sanitised, cleaned and made available to the next guest - and that can happen a lot faster than you think.\nHowever, don't expect much information from the hotel about this. Staffers are forbidden from revealing any details of cause of death and room numbers.\nIf a death occurs, once the person is removed, the room is sanitised, cleaned and made available to the next guest - and that can happen a lot faster than you'd think\nStaff don't care as much as you think\nFor particularly difficult guests, it is not unknown for a staff member to seek revenge on their toothbrush or even change their key card to lock them out of their room, claimed Tomsky.\nHe said he came across staffers who stole from minibars and from valet-parked cars. Often, the mischief that staffers engaged in was purely out of boredom, he said.\nForrest Jones said that housekeepers rush in order to fulfil their Quote: of rooms, and can get questioned if they take more than a half-hour to make a room, or 15 minutes to service a room occupied by a stay-over guest.\nMany housekeepers are rushed, and a lot of the time, no one goes behind them to inspect the rooms.\nStaff look through your personal items\nTomsky claimed that boredom led to rifling through guests' stuff, reading intimate information about them and giggling over their collections of sex toys.\n'I found a pretty foul letter left in a room,' he said. 'It was about someone's wife being a whore. It was probably a joke, because there was a stamp on it of genitalia, addressed to a Mr. Cuckold, with details about her sexual activities.'\nYou may want to think twice about using hand towels according to hotel industry insider Michael Forrest Jones\nBeware hand towels\n'You know where you almost always find a hand towel in any recently-vacated hotel room that was occupied by a guy? On the floor... next to the bed,' said Forrest Jones.\nThe hotel has enough for three times the amount of guests\nForrest Jones said that ideally, a hotel will keep three 'turns', or 'par', of sheets and towels, which means enough supplies to make every room in the hotel, three times over .\nIf an item has a visible stain that doesn't come out in the wash, it will be retired, and if the quality reasonable, it will be dyed red or blue and used as a cleaning rag.\nRead more: We Found A 3-Star Hotel Chain's Cleaning Guide, And We Were Shocked At What Gets Cleaned The Least What are the things we don't know about hotel rooms? - Quora Michael Forrest Jones's answer to What are the things we don't know about hotel rooms? - Quora www.quora.com/Wh...", "external_links": ["https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-things-we-dont-know-about-hotel-rooms/answer/Michael-Forrest-Jones", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/keithhabersberger/we-found-a-3-star-hotel-chains-cleaning-guide-we-were-shocke#.qr4bZjw4wQ", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "https://www.quora.com/Why-does-it-take-so-long-to-check-in-at-hotels/answer/Stacy-Jean", "http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-things-we-dont-know-about-hotel-rooms", "http://dailym.ai/1iNXmuT"], "published": "2015-09-16T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:01:10.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
