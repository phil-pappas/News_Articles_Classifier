And on that website, some people started making videos that they had uploaded. YouTube grew up to be a giant website, worth $40 billion, and soon, more and more people signed up. There’s a chance that you might have heard of YouTube, and you might have heard of a phenomenon called vlogging . It’s like blogging, but on video. Users sit in a room, or walk around their house, town, city, street, neighbourhood, wherever, talking to themselves – or technically, you, the waiting audience – and then hey presto, there’s a video! They cut it together, add some twinkly music in the background , and upload it to the big YouTube portal in the sky. Vlogger Zoe Sugg, aka Zoella, with some of her adoring fans Photo: Matt Anderson/PA Wire Now, such is their influence over the tween population of the world, there's even a magazine dedicated to vloggers . But they're not all spring chickens, freshly hatched from the nest of adolescence. Some of them are legitimate, real grown ups - adults. And because we know how to treat you really well here on GoodLife , we wanted to introduce you to some of our favourite beauty vloggers - that are, wait for it, over 50. Makeup and skincare is something that women of all ages can get on board with, and if you're looking for a right helping hand (of about your own age) then look no further than these ladies. Some of them are bigger than others. None are, as yet, as big as Zoella , but there's still time. Hit these ladies up for your regular dose of beauty favourites, a dose of new product unboxing and every single honest product review that you could ever want.
