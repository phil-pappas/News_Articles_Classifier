The 164-room property makes sure you sleep tight through various features, including comfy mattresses, duck feather pillows and duvets, blackout curtains and chamomile tea in the lobby before bedtime. \n2. The hotel's city location means many restaurants and activities are within walking distance. For PG fun, there are Ripley's Believe it or Not and Central Festival Pattaya Beach. Walk about 15 minutes to the Walking Street for fun that's a bit more, um, questionable. The beach is less than 10 minutes away if you walk through the back of The Avenue Pattaya. Don't forget to check out the vans that sell beverages our legal team says we can't promote. \n3. On the flip side, the hotel's location and height affords guests no sea view. Oh well, there are no in-room balconies, anyway. \n4. There are three room types. Sleep and Dream rooms are essentially the same, except that two Sleep rooms can be joined via a connecting door. Both types are about 20m?, but are smartly designed so you won't feel like a cat sleeping in a shoebox. The bathroom/walk-in closet is large in proportion to room size. \n5. If you want a bit of luxury, opt for the 40m? OZO Suite. It has a living area with a TV and a sofa-bed. Only two OZO Suites are available. \n6. The complimentary shampoo and body wash in the bathroom are of spa quality, being made by Breeze Spa. \n7. The hotel doesn't put anything in the minibars except for two complimentary bottles of water. So stock yours with things from the 7-Eleven just across the street, in case you want a cold nightcap after a long day. \n8. Breakfast is available at Eat, the hotel's all-day restaurant. It's on the rooftop of the hotel and next to a swimming pool. The breakfast selection is bountiful but basic. \n9. The hotel's fitness room is called Tone. It is 24/7, in case you want to keep your vacation weight gain in check. \n10. The interactive lectern near the entrance can help plan your day. It offers an overview of Pattaya attractions and displays preselected itineraries according to the length of your stay. \n11. The staff we met were hospitable, from a cleaning lady who greeted us in the morning to a receptionist who calmly dealt with an angry guest. Another one told us where to learn to play the ukulele. \n12. OZO Pattaya is offering an anniversary promotion until the end of Oct. A stay in a Sleep room starts from B1,155++ per night and includes breakfast for two, 20 per cent off F&B and 3pm late checkout. Book online at the hotel's website using promo code \"OZOAN1\". \nVenue: OZO Pattaya, 236/26-1 Moo 10, Soi 15 at Second Road, Pattaya, Nong Prue, Banglamung, Chon Buri.
