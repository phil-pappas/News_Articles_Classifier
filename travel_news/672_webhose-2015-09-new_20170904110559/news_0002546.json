Another room was full of giant canvases painted by a German artist.\nSAX APPEAL: Penny with saxophone player Rob on the Jazzy B cruise\nAnd that was one part of the resort. All quirky and idiosyncratic. The other part is called Jade Mountain, and it’s like something out of a James Bond film, with bright glass sculptures atop towering pinnacles of granite.\nThe rooms are open on two sides and your view is of the majestic Pitons rising from the turquoise sea on one side, while the rainforest rolls to the beach on the other.\nTalk about the wow factor.\nNormally, the idea of an open room (and for room, read whopping great Chelsea flat) would fill me with horror.\nThe double threat of mosquitoes and voyeurism would have me covered in netting and hiding behind a very large palm.\n 2 Next Family aboard diverted flight forced to 'sleep rough' at an...

You touch the leaves, they close up – my grandmother used to make tea with it as a cure for constipation’) to a leaf that stains your fingers bright red (‘they used it for dyeing clothes and nothing takes it out’).\nHe spotted green herons and tiny humming birds, and showed us how to open a coconut without spilling the milk, to pick an out-of-reach tangerine using a forked branch, and how to play a game involving sucked cocoa beans. I lost.\nHe also took the precaution of grabbing a couple of bin- liners from the kitchen before we set out and when the heavens suddenly opened, made a hole in the bottom and gave me a rudimentary mackintosh. Cracking.\nJanice, our waitress at lunch, commented on it. ‘Nice coat. Is it one of those made-to-measure jobs from Paris?’\nOne afternoon we took a cruise on the yacht Serenity with Captain Kerwin and Theofor, who threw out a line to see whether any fish would bite. There were six of us on the boat and we laughed so much I had to have an extra rib put in.\nThat rum punch was strong. Or maybe it was the strong sea breeze which had us belting north along the coast towards the capital, Castries.\nOne evening a week, you can go on the three-hour Jazzy B Cruise while listening to a sax master called Rob with hair like a badly disordered pineapple.\nIt was all very chilled until we spotted a whopping pod of dolphins and suddenly everyone was talking to each other and bonding as the dolphins leapt and twirled through the big blue. Captain Garfield told us that sometimes they see pods of more than a hundred. ‘The sea looks like it’s boiling,’ he observed.\nThe next day, we had a look round our local town, Soufrière, which was important in the 18th Century because of the sulphur deposited by the island’s warm springs, which come from the local volcano.\nThe name Soufrière actually means ‘sulphur mine’. We loitered in the warm mineral baths, where allegedly, Napoleon’s wife Josephine would swim.\n‘Sulphur, so good,’ I quipped.\nTRAVEL FACTS ITC Luxury Travel ( itcluxurytravel.co.uk , 01244 355 527) offers seven nights at Anse Chastenet from £2,749pp. Seven nights at Jade Mountain costs from £4,349.
