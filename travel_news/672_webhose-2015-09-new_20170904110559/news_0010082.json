And I mean nobody.” \nIf that sounds familiar, it could be because your neighbour, co-worker or one of your golf pals was bragging about a recent trip to Predator Ridge, which is just over six hours of drive-time west of Calgary. \nAnd if you haven’t been? \nWell … as long as your boss isn’t Bob Hartley, the fall could be the ideal time to find out what all the fuss is about. Both courses at Predator Ridge will remain open until after Thanksgiving long weekend. \n“It needs to be experienced to be appreciated — simple as that,” Zokol said. \n“Most people, I just tell them you have to see it to believe it,” agreed former LPGA Tour player A.J. Eathorne, who was born in Calgary, raised in the Okanagan and is now head of instruction at Predator Ridge. “And that’s so true. You can tell them how beautiful it is and that the golf courses are great and the views are great and all the rest, but you have to really be here and touch it and feel it to get the best of it. \n“And once people are here, we hear a lot of, ‘Wow, this is awesome.’ It’s just so relaxing. The service is great. People are just so happy to be here … \n“It’s like an adult Disneyland.” \nIt’s not unusual for Stanley Cup winners to shout ‘I’m going to Disneyland!’ after getting their fingers on the NHL’s ultimate prize. \nTruth is, they might be headed to Predator Ridge instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:47:58.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
