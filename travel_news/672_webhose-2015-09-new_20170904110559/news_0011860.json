Space travel\nIn the years since the Icehotel was founded in 1989, other ice hotels and experiences have sprung up around the world.\nIcehotel's own Icebar has become a chain with drinking spots in Stockholm , London and beyond.\nThose glorified freezers can't match the frosty magnificence of the original Icebar though, with its authentic Arctic setting and snowmobiles and dog sledding just on the doorstep.\nIntriguingly, Icehotel is branching out into space travel and taking reservations for trips with Virgin Galactic.\nThat service has yet to take flight.\nIn the meantime, the frozen tundra of northern Sweden still feels like no place on Earth.\nIcehotel , Marknadsvagen 63, Jukkasjarvi 981 91 Sweden;", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150902122835-icehotel-7-doors-large-169.jpg", "http://www.simplysweden.co.uk/icehotel", "http://www.icebarstockholm.se/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150902122835-icehotel-7-doors-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/07/ice-hotel-long.jpg)", "http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g939981-d259843-Reviews-m14631-Icehotel-Jukkasjarvi_Norrbotten_County.html", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150902122835-icehotel-7-doors-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://www.icehotel.com/activities/space-travel/", "http://www.icebarlondon.com/", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150902122835-icehotel-7-doors-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150902122835-icehotel-7-doors-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150902122835-icehotel-7-doors-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150902122835-icehotel-7-doors-small-11.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-04T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T10:22:07.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
