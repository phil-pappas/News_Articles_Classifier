For that kind of comfort, who wouldn't be nice? \nRude and uncooperative fellow-passengers make flying difficult for airline staff and fliers alike. And although there will always be die-hards who insist that you can never get upgraded on a flight merely for being \"nice,\" I beg to differ. Consider my experience on a recent American Airlines flight between Los Angeles and New York's JFK. \nLo and behold, the seat next to me in business class is empty as the door is about to close. With so many people attaining \"status\" in American's frequent flyer program, or paying $75 plus 15,000 miles for a one-way upgrade, it almost never happens on this route. \nTwo minutes before scheduled takeoff and there's a kerfuffle in economy. Someone is not happy with his seat and is letting the cabin crew know about it in no uncertain terms. Angry voices waft over the boarding music. Maybe someone wanted to sit next to a travelling companion. I was never able to find out. \nA gate agent and a flight attendant appear at my row. \nGate agent: \"Is this seat occupied?\" \nMe (crestfallen): \"Um, Noo ...\" \nGate agent: \"Well, I need to upgrade someone.\" \nFlight attendant: \"Shouldn't we upgrade 12C?\" (Row 12 is in the economy cabin). \nGate agent, exasperated: \"I an NOT rewarding that kind of behaviour with an upgrade!\" (Her exact words.) \nI'm guessing that 12C had some kind of status. Or felt he did. Or was the source of the problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T09:37:29.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
