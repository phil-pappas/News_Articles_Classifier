The vibrant, fast-paced 30-second spot, produced by Orange County-based marketing group, YNR Marketing, dares viewers to imagine what they can do while visiting Anaheim.\nAnaheim, one of Orange County’s largest and oldest cities, is home to prestigious attractions, entertainment and sports venues, theme parks and an exploding foodie and brew scene. In the first-ever commercial for the Southern California DMO, the aim is to tease viewers with a collage of the destination’s highlights, while inspiring them to imagine what they would do while visiting Anaheim. Set to a pulsating soundtrack of staccato beats that moves the viewer through a string of energizing Anaheim-centric scenes, in 30 seconds viewers can see why millions of visitors come each and every year to vacation in this storied Southern California destination.\n“This year has been full of firsts for Visit Anaheim, starting with the debut of our fresh, contemporary brand in June,” said Charles Harris, senior vice president, marketing, Visit Anaheim. “Our new brand has given us license to explore new ways to encourage travelers to do what our new name suggests: Visit Anaheim – and what better way than to create a visual montage of the best our destination has to offer. Our city is bursting with new things to do every day and this commercial allows us to showcase a taste of things to do on a national scale to a large, captive audience.”\nThe 30-second commercial will air on NBCSN starting Sept.11 and will run throughout the duration of the NPGL Playoffs and Final (Oct. 6). The broadcast commercial will be supported by a banner ad on NPGL.com, full-page ad in NPGL’s event program plus signage to appear during the events.
