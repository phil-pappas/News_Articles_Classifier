Cradle of\nHumankind brand manager Adrian Amod also confirmed the heritage site had been\ninundated with calls from school groups inquiring about available days to visit since the\nannouncement.\nOn Thursday a new species of hominid unveiled at Maropeng was described by scientists as a new branch of the human family tree. Homo naledi was unveiled to the world’s media – including National Geographic, which helped with the research – as well as scientists, the\nteam of excavators and government officials.\n“Since the discovery, we have had a lot of calls from people who want day visits from\nschools countrywide and also some international visitors,” said Amod. “We do expect some\nincrease in the number of international guests since there has been a lot of media\npresentation internationally, especially in our primary markets such as the UK, USA,\nGermany and Africa.”\nAmod said 25% of inquiries were from school groups, while the others were about day visits for weekends and holidays. He also said the heritage site was already fully booked from October 1 to 11, but they might have other days available. The school holidays start on October 2. The site, situated in the region of Sterkfontein, has on average 8 000 visitors\nmonthly. With the new discovery, more visitors are expected, Amod added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:16:25.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
