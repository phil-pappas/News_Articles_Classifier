Recently Visa and Tourism Australia are capitalising on the trend that is emerging in a big way of posing for photos on Facebook or Instagram with unique places in the background. Tourism Australia and Visa are working on a multi million dollar deal that will help to promote travel and sports which will spread beyond the eastern seaboard. The tourism board is also trying to find out about the spending patterns of tourists so that the future campaigns know just which areas would be most attractive for tourists.\nGiving tourists a slice of local tourism attractions will be an important focus. Driving them to the lesser known sites which will be beyond the regular sites, is being held as important strategy.Building greater markets for the largest Chinese visitors who are the strongest visitors to Australia to the eastern seaboard. But the Western Australia is only receiving 5 per cent of its international visitors from China. The largest market in this zone is the UK compared to the closest neighbour New Zealand. Chinese visitation has grown by 22 per cent in Australia in this year.\nSpending in the east Australian sector has been recorded as maximum in this year till June 30, with a maximum spent of 10 percent, a record of $33.4 million but comparatively the performance in the West Australia has been only 1 per cent and in South Australia 5 per cent. On the other hand NSW recorded a 10 to 15 per cent growth. Hoteliers in West Australia blame the figures on the low level of state government funding. The focus is more on East Australia. The Tourism Australia campaigns will go beyond the eastern seaboard and will take tourists from China and other Asian and western markets to the western and southern regions as well.\nThe campaign which already include partnership with online travel agents like Expedia, Chinaâ€™s big time internet giant Alibaba. Tourism Australia has set targets of achieving 30 per cent in its partnership revenue from non-traditional sources.
