Grapery , a vineyard based in Shafter, California, has done it. After years of growing extremely flavorful, all-natural hybrid grapes and selectively cross-breeding these different varieties, the company stumbled upon a very happy accident in one of its crops: a perfect confectionary cotton candy taste. “We weren’t trying to make Cotton Candy, we were just trying to develop new grapes that taste great,” says Jim Beagle, CEO of Grapery. “That they turned out to taste like cotton candy was just luck.”\nThough it seems Grapery has never been looking to produce just another table grape. In addition to the flavor innovation in the Cotton Candy grape, the company has been playing with the shape of grapes as well. Take the spookily named Witch Fingers: “freaky-looking” long and pointy grapes that resemble a baby carrot, or Moon Drops: intriguingly tubular bites that look a bit like a cocktail sausage that happens to be purple. They’re as fun to look at as they are tasty.\nIt may be hard to believe that these sweet bites are all natural (though Whole Foods does sell them, after all). But Beagle is quick to point out that these intense flavors aren’t common because what is sold in most stores are grown for size, at the quickest possible rate, for the cheapest price. For that reason, most other grape producers are effectively selectively breeding out the intensity of flavor that Grapery fosters. Some Grapery varieties can take more than ten years to cultivate, but that doesn’t mean it’s stopping with cotton candy. It’ll soon release a gumball-flavored grape, with more sweet flavors to follow in the next year. Pure imagination, it seems, can be real—and totally delicious.", "external_links": ["http://www.grapery.biz/"], "published": "2015-09-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T06:53:03.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
