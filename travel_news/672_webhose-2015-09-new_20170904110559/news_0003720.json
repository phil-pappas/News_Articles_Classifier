England’s attention to detail is a good example. Their training base – the luxurious Pennyhill Park hotel near Bagshot in Surrey – has a purpose-built training centre featuring a pitch that has the same dimensions and grass as Twickenham.

Monday Video analysis of any recent matches precedes training at Pennyhill Park. Players are put up for media interviews.
