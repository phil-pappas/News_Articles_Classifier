He plays well with others, regardless of ideology. And he is competent and contentious — unglamorous, essential virtues for a public servant.\nHe drew a serious opponent this year, Everett businessman Greg Tisdel. But Tisdel’s critique of Sullivan is diffuse, and his platform shows a lack of familiarity with the workings of the county.\nSullivan, in contrast, has a fluid grasp of the most important issue facing Snohomish County — planning for growth. Sullivan was an original advocate for the state’s Growth Management Act and now advocates channeling density into urban cores.\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Russell Wilson buys $6.7 million waterfront mansion in Bellevue, report says Kam Chancellor speaks to NFL Network, says he’s willing ‘to meet the Seahawks halfway’ Empty classes, no talks as Seattle schools stalemate continues ‘Passport day’ coming up in Seattle Struggling Haggen files for bankruptcy protection, parts with Southwest co-CEO Sullivan’s challenge this term will be to move beyond his opposition to commercial air operations at Paine Field. That decision has been made by the County Council, and it was a good one. Sullivan should use his decades-long experience on this issue to mitigate impacts on the surrounding neighborhood, and not to try to unwind that decision.\nSnohomish County voters should send Sullivan, an old hand at leadership, back to the council again.\nEditorial board members are editorial page editor Kate Riley, Frank A.
