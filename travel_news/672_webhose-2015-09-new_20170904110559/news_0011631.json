The fossils represent the third stage, with tall, wide and robust bodies and an exclusively terrestrial bipedalism, with no evidence of arboreal behaviors.\nThe authors suggested that the Atapuerca humans offer the best look at the general human body shape and size during the last million years before the advent of modern humans.\nThe study has been published in the Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 11:58 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:33:48.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
