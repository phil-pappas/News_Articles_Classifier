Fun and games for fans will be at every tour stop, with appearances by college football legends, local chefs cooking up tailgate fare, cornhole tournaments, a Sports Illustrated cover photo booth, and a virtual quarterback simulator – all surrounded by two, state-of the art RVs to elevate the tailgate experience.\nThe Labor Day evening opening game is a rematch of last year's only loss by the Buckeyes, an early season 2014 match-up in Columbus, Ohio where the Hokies – with Sports Illustrated and Go RVing on hand – pulled off a major upset. The tour stop in Blacksburg will feature Bruce Smith , famed Virginia Tech alum and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nOther stops during this 3 rd consecutive tailgate tour season will include East Lansing, Michigan ; Eugene, Oregon ; Pasadena, California ; College Station, Texas ; Norman, Oklahoma ; Auburn, Alabama ; Clemson, South Carolina ; and Starkville, Mississippi . The tour will conclude on Saturday, November 21 in Columbus, Ohio when the Ohio State Buckeyes host the Michigan State Spartans in a game that could have national title implications. A complete schedule of the tour can be found at www.si.com/tailgatetour .\nOn board for this year's tour will be former college stars such as Michigan State's T.J. Duckett, Oklahoma's Billy Simms , Auburn's Jason Campbell , Clemson's Jeff Bostic , and Florida State's Charlie Ward . More football stars will be joining the tour throughout the season, and Andrew \"McLovin\" Perloff of Sports Illustrated and the Dan Patrick Show will attend at least half of the games.\nAnchoring the ten stops will be two tailgate-ready RVs. A Winnebago Brave motorhome and the Lance 2612 Toy Hauler will provide the backdrop for a coast-to-coast party on wheels. The RV set-up includes large exterior TVs complete with soundbars and subwoofers, pull-out exterior tailgate bars, grills, outdoor refrigerators and interior space with more TVs and comfy seating.\nThe events will feature tours of the RVs, as well as an online sweepstakes with the grand prize winner awarded an Ultimate Tailgate Experience for a game of their choice during the 2016 tour. Avalanche Cooler products made by Dometic will be given away randomly at various tour stops. Residents of the U.S. can enter the sweepstakes by visiting www.si.com/tailgatetoursweeps .\nCheck out the Tailgate Tour hub at www.si.com/tailgatetour for more information, including exclusive college football content, rivalry recaps, profiles of college hotspots, and deep dives on team traditions.
