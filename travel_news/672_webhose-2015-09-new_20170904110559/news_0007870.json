Thierry Duguet, who oversees CWT Meetings & Events global marketing said, “Nearly every businessperson has a smartphone, so apps are an integral part of our lives. With Meet by CWT M&E, we help event and meeting planners ensure increased engagement and a positive meeting experience for delegates. At the same time, we’re making sure their companies are getting better value by making it simple for everyone to make the most of every meeting.” CWT Meetings & Events, the meetings and events division of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, initially piloted Meet by CWT in the Nordic region, which is well known for its tech savvy and early adopter behaviour. After the successful trial, it is now available for everyone to download from the Apple App Store and Google Play. Pernilla Andrén, senior director, CWT Meetings & Events, Nordic countries, added, “Event apps have been around for a while, but mostly for big events. We’re now leading the trend towards using them for small and mid-sized meetings. People want to be able to easily access meeting details on their smartphone. Our app means they can do just that.” Meet by CWT M&E is fully secure. Users must log on using an email address that is matched to a meeting in the CWT Meetings & Events’ database.
