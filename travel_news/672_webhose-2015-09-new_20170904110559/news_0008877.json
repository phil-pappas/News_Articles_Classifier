For the first time in Cineposium’s 39-year history, this year’s conference is dedicated to one topic, Film Tourism.\nIn 2012 the Tourism Competitive Intelligence reported that 40 million international tourists chose their destination primarily because they saw a film shot in that country. Up to 10 percent of the tourists in the survey attributed movies as a factor in deciding on their destination.\n“Filming and tourism have reached a noticeable level of significance in Barcelona to the point that now the concept is being strategically examined in order to establish it as a sustainable model,” said Carles Sala, Director of Barcelona Capital with the Barcelona City Council. “Film tourism appeals to both local and foreign visitors, and it drives them towards popular, less known and unexplored areas, highlighting our local cultural and unique landmarks.”\nThis year’s conference will include program sessions featuring Hollywood executives, film commissions and tourism bureaus from across the globe to discuss the added value that film tourism produces for global economies.\nHBO Vice-President of Media Relations, Mara Mikialian will serve as a panelist in the How Northern Ireland Wins a the Game of Thrones program session; she joins Moyra Locke, Head of Marketing, Communication and Audiences, for Northern Ireland Screen and Brian Twomey, Head of Content and Marketing Communications, Tourism Ireland to discuss successful relationship between their respective offices to promote and manage access to major sites of the Emmy nominated hit TV show, “Game of Thrones” in Ireland.\nRobert Raines, Executive Director, Tennessee Film, Entertainment & Music (“Nashville”), Colette Geragthy, Head of Film Promotion and Culture, Film London (Paddington and Skyfall) and Geoff Alexander, Film Commissioner, Santa Barbara Film Commission (“The Bachelorette” and Sideways) will provide examples of their revenue income increases, advertising value, and the “social” buzz yielded from increased tourism in the Defining & Measuring ROI of Tourism Friendly Productions program session.\n“The AFCI believe that film and tourism are a natural pairing and the concept has been in existence for many years. It’s only recently we’ve given it an official term like film tourism or screen tourism. We are excited to examine and discuss the concept in-depth at Cineposium,” said Kevin Clark, Executive Director of the AFCI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:22:34.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
