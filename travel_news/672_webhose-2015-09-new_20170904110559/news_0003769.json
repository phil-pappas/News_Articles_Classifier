It’s one of the reasons I enjoy the Turtle Beach Inn in Indian Pass Beach near Apalachicola.\nBut there are other reasons, too.\nYou never have to look far for a porch swing or rocking chair at the Turtle Beach Inn. Contributed The Indian Pass beach is one of the best shelling spots outside of Sanibel. I found my first angel wing (a clamshell that looked like it might have been torn from a heavenly messenger) in front of the Turtle Beach Inn. I didn’t find its mate, but I did find more shells — many shells — from scallops and whelks to conchs and augers. Many of them have become part of my patio décor.\nThe Turtle Beach Inn, built in 1997, sits on stilts and overlooks the Gulf of Mexico. It has four ocean-view guest rooms and a two-bedroom cottage, all with private baths, and a Turtle Tower with two one-bedroom condos.\nSwings and rocking chairs line the porches and the beach, with its sugar-fine sand, remains a favorite of guests who return as often as their schedules and budgets permit.\nShell collectors might find an angel wing shell on the beach. Contributed Sea turtles are frequent visitors, which is how the B&B came to be called the Turtle Beach Inn.\nBesides shell collecting, turtle watching and sunset gazing, guests pass the time canoeing, kayaking, motor boating, fishing, swimming, and horseback riding or biking. St. Vincent Island, a wildlife preserve, is just a short boat ride away.\nThe family owned and operated B&B is a Florida DEP-certified Green Lodging establishment, too.\nTurtle pillows and trinkets can be found throughout the B&B. Contributed And last, but not least, guests can count on a yummy complimentary breakfast every morning.\nTurtle Beach Inn on at Port St. Joe in Florida’s Panhandle sits between cabbage palms and long-needled pines on a beach known for attracting sea turtles. Contributed Watching the sunset is a favorite pastime for guests at the Turtle Beach Inn. Contributed\nIF YOU GO\nThe Turtle Beach Inn and cottages is at 140 Painted Pony Road, Port St. Joe. Accommodations include the four-room inn, a two-bedroom cottage and two one-bedroom condos in the Turtle Tower. Rates start at $190 a night.
