Individuals, foundations, and corporations can visit www.nationalparks.org/everykidinapark to contribute to the effort. \nAs part of the Foundation's Open OutDoors for Kids program, the Every Kid in a Park transportation grants seek to remove barriers to accessing our nation's public lands and waters, with a special focus on underserved and urban communities. With cutbacks in school funding for field trips, this strategic funding will help provide comprehensive access to all federal sites, including national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and public lands and waters. \n\"America is blessed with the great outdoors, and through Every Kid in a Park, we're inviting every fourth grader and their families to enjoy our nation's unrivaled public lands and waters,\" said Secretary Jewell. \"We want to make sure every American has the opportunity to develop a lifelong connection to our nation's land, water and wildlife, and these Every Kid in a Park transportation grants can help make that happen.\" \n\"By connecting fourth graders to our nation's great parks and public lands, the Every Kid in a Park initiative will help us build a strong generation of stewards who will care for and protect these treasured places during our next 100 years,\" said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis. \"Thanks to our philanthropic partner, the National Park Foundation, fourth graders across the nation will experience the great outdoor and historic classrooms that parks and other public lands provide.\" \n\"In order to foster deep connections to America's national parks and all public lands and waters, we must introduce our young people to these incredible places early in life,\" said Will Shafroth, president and CEO of the National Park Foundation. \"We are proud to support the White House's efforts by providing critical funding through Every Kid in a Park transportation grants. Together, we can remove obstacles preventing the next generation from interacting with America's public lands.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:58:00.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
