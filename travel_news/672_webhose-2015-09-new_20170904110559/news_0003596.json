The plane was leaving for a 10-hour flight to London with 157 passengers aboard.

They had water on the fire within two minutes, and by 4:18 it was out. \nFire officials said the blaze was confined to the left engine, and there was no wheel or brake fire. \nThe evacuation also took only minutes and appeared orderly, with some passengers even making it out with their luggage . Passengers slid off the plane and hurried across the tarmac as flames leaped from the Boeing 777-200 and dark black smoke billowed. aftermath of british airways flight 2276 pic.twitter.com/mpHgcuiXMM — CastroBelRico (@SuaveCastro) September 9, 2015 \nOfficials also said more people were injured than previously reported. A total of 27 people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, most with cuts, bruises, burns and scrapes from the evacuation slide. At least two complained of smoke inhalation. \nMeanwhile, officials have turned their attention to the cause of the British Airways Flight 2276 fire, though so far little has been said about how a plane speeding down a runway for takeoff could suddenly catch on fire, or whether it could happen again. \nA team of investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board was travelling to Las Vegas from Washington, DC, agency spokesman Eric Weiss said. Preliminary reports usually are issued within about a week, and a complete investigation in unusual or precedent-setting cases can take more than a year. \n\"We're calling it an engine fire,\" Weiss said. \"We're interested in the exact chain of events.\" \nREAD MORE: Passengers slammed after British Airways plane catches fire \nPassenger Karen Bravo, 60, of Las Vegas, said she happened to have her purse and some other passengers had carry-on luggage. \n\"It would be like if your whole house was on fire and you had to go out the door,\" she said. \nThe checked bags weren't damaged, but passengers hadn't gotten them back as of Thursday morning. They were told that another plane was on its way and they should be departing for London. \nJacob Steinberg, a Guardian journalist, tweeted this image of his friend running from the burning plane.

British Airways said it is providing passengers with hotels and whatever else they may need, and added that the safety of its customers and crew is a top priority. \nSmoke billows from the British Airways plane.

One of the runways reopened about 2½ hours after the fire. \nLas Vegas' airport is the ninth-busiest in the US and had nearly 43 million passengers last year. The airport has been taking steps to accommodate more international travellers seeking direct flights to Europe and Asia, including adding new gates to accommodate wide-body double-decker jets. \nPROBLEMS FOR BOEING \nThis is the fourth Boeing 777 to have been involved in a serious incident in just three years. \nIn 2013, Asiana Airlines Flight 214 crashed at San Francisco International airport, due to pilot error. \nIn 2014 Malaysia Airlines Flight 12 was shot down while flying over Ukraine. While the most controversial was the disappearance of flight MH370, which is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean. \nAP/Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:58:58.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
