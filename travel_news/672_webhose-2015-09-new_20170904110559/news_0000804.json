So we too had planned to visit the place on the same day.We all woke up around 5'o clock in the morning and being net-savvy we never bothered to book a local cab rather was dependent on Online Cab services which didn't responded that well so early in the morning and we finally got a local taxi which agreed to drop us. We had already booked CC ticket for KANCHANJANGA EXP a month back which departed from Sealdah around 06:35am.The starting sound of the train engine made us all happy and slowly we left the polluted city air to the green field and the clear blue sky. Reached Ramphurhat around 10.50am and as expected the whole train rushed to get down and the packed train left empty. Beware of Dalals near the station, go to platform no 1 and walk straight towards the Auto Stand. The local auto and rickshaw was available but too much of bargaining needs to be done. The Charge which they ask for might get down to 50% which happened in our case. We hired a big Auto which first asked us to pay Rs.30 each which is around Rs.210 but later he agreed to take us there for Rs.100.We have previously booked Non A/C 3 Double Bed Room at Gouri Hotels Rs.550 each. We reached our hotel in next 15mins.The Hotel was quite cozy which had good A/C restaurant below but the waiter behavior was not up to the mark. We tried both Bengali & Chiness food which is equally good. Chili Chicken was very tasty. After having lunch we took a power nap and left for tarapith ,since there would be a huge rush at the temple we decided to go off early as possible. We finally got a big Auto and it took us to the temple, charged us Rs.100.We had to walk down few meters to reach the temple. We had a hired a priest from the shop which was at the back gate of the temple. He explained us everything about the temple and how things need to be done. We entered the temple and luckily there was small queue. While entering the main temple there will be a priest at the gate who would ask you for some donation and would constantly say things to make you afraid,he is only there to collect money in the name of god, just ask him would u like me to go away without offering puja and just push him a little an ignore ,he wont do anything. If there are ladies in your group he would narrate the same rubbish things that god will do this and that, he will try to advantage of your fear just push him a little and enter. The same kind of welcome we got near the feet of Ma Tara where the so called priest said how dare we didnt bring anything while coming to the mandir but at the end of the day its best to ignore or pay very less to avoid chaos. Later our priest started uttering the mantras and we followed his words and i offered my prayers and my garlands to the goddess and came out. Our Priest informed us this same small queue will turn into massive chaotic queues as the Amavasya night folds in. There is beautiful pond and few other temples to look around. We then hired a 2 cycle van for Rs.200 each for up and down journey and left for ATLA village which is a birthplace of Sadhok Bamakhyapa a famous tantric saint who worshipped Ma Tara. The path towards his birthplace is truly a treat for nature lovers. The green paddy field, cattle sheds and the clearest blue sky makes the environment so cool that it brings peace to both your heart and mind. It took more than 20mins to reach. The place was mostly his pictures and his ancestors and currently his fourth generations are staying in the village. We met his family members. The Original house is divided into two parts due to some rifts between the brothers and both of the families trying to attract pilgrims, so we got confused and we entered both. But people here are equally good and charming and decent when compared to Tarapith priests. The belongings of the saint Bamakhepa like the axe, sandals, shawls, etc. are nicely preserved. We also saw the original photograph of Bamakhepa , only a single piece was clicked by a photographer during his lifetime. The exact place where Bamdev was born is nicely preserved. We left the place when the sun was about to go down. We reached Tarapith again but now the areas mood was completely changed, there were more than a thousand of people and lots of police. The security was tight. Our next destination was the cremation ground which said to be the most powerful and haunted during amabashya night. We came down to the cremation ground. The place was only lid with small lamps and its truly very mystic and did it give me Goosebumps when I saw Goat sacrifice being done every few seconds and people giving tikas with warn blood, few tantriks were doing yagnas.I felt very uncomfortable and left the place after few minutes. We had some snacks and came to our hotel via Auto van (Rs.100) again. Day 2: (12.09.2015) A Non AC Tata Sumo was booked Rs12/km for the route source Rampurhat to Masenjor Dam to Bakreshwar to destination Bolpur. We left our hotel around 8o Clock, and left for Massanjore. The roads were very smooth as we entered the Jungle Areas of Jharkhand & West Bengal Borders. We thrice found a group of locals trying to get money in the name of god for some pujas and other reason, you can bypass them by saying we are government officials which does the trick. The up and down roads are mostly through hill and finally we could see the green mountains far away. Finally we could hear the gurgling sound of the water rushing through and we reached the Canada dam aka Masaenjore Dam.The Dam is huge and location is exotict The Dam is on Mayurakshi River also known as Mor. There are two guesthouses available near to this Dam which is on top the hill providing a panoramic view of the area. One of them is maintained by the government. Its a high security area and as per the rules we were not suppose to take pictures of the dam, legal charges would be applicable if caught. Surprisingly when we are walking towards the dam few people were taking pictures with ease and no one was there to track them. So we clicked few pictures too. The huge river on one side is calm and quiet while the other side is demonic. We were lucky to see that one the gates were opened and the water was flowing heavily. There is a small shop beside the entrance of the dam. After having snacks from there we left for Bakreshwar around 10.30.We reached Bakreshwar around 12o clock and what a welcome everyone was ready with their restaurant visiting cards offering different kinds of food. We entered the Lord Shiva temple. Bakreshwar is also a place of many hot springs. There are ten hot springs here, the locals informed us its due to Helium Gas beneath the area. One of the hot springs Agni kunda .The water in this spring is at 80 degrees Celsius and its guarded with barrack for safety. We finally worshiped the Lord Shiva and Ma Shakti.The Brahmin here took Rs.101 for all the pujas and mantras he performed.We left the place around 1o clock and went towards Siuri town for lunch. Near Suri Bus Stand there was a Bengali hotel cum restaurant Yuvraj which was clean and budget friendly.They provided Veg Meal for Rs.60 and Egg Meal for Rs.80 & Chicken Meal for Rs.120.We left after having lunch and reached Bolpur around 3pm.We travelled around 190 kms and paid of the cab according to the rate.Bolpur Lodge which we have booked previously was our place to rest for the night. We took Non AC three double bedrooms for Rs.550 each as AC room was not available (Rate Rs.750).The rooms were on the top but spacious as well as the too big for two people to sleep, washroom was clean and tidy. The Lodge has its own restaurant but you have to order few hours before for them to preapare.Bhaskar is the person who looks around the cooking department. Egg Meal was Rs.80,Fish was 90 and chicken was Rs.110.The food which they provided is good in quantity and taste.Later around 7o clock in the evening we hired a TOTO Battery operated van for Rs.200 up & down to reach a Kankalitala Goddess Kali Temple which was on the back of Kopai river. While traveling through labhpur road there was complete darkness all around and the sky was crystal clear with paddy fields around. I wish I could capture what we experienced. THE CLEAR SKY WAS MORE THEN A LAKHS OF STARS AND THE UNCOUNTABLE FIRE FLIES AROUND . We were speechless just speechless for what we have just witnessed. We reached the temple and offered our prayers and came back to our lodge early. Day 3: (13.09.2015) Bolpur Lodge offers sightseeing of Bolpur-Shantiniketan with their own Private cars for Rs.1000 but we opt for more open car TOTO which can easily travel in any area. Bargain is the most specific part which needs to be done with them.Madan Da our Toto Driver was charging Rs.500 for one TOTO later which came to Rs.350.So we left the lodge around 7 and at first we went to beads of Khowai river, every Saturday a fair is held at this place. Local handcrafted things are sold here. Then we went a tribal place where Santhals reside their art work and leaf plate was something which impressed us a lot. Then we went towards the Deer park aka Ballavpur Wildlife Sanctuary which was suppose to open their gates by 10 but it was not opened till 10.30 so we decided to skip it. We then went to Srijoni Silpo Gram (Industrial Village).Lots of Art and hand made things were inside the area of Srijoni ,one of the best part was a Baul Singer whose music and voice was soothing for our city life ears. Our next destination was Viswa Bharati University,Tagore Ashrama and Chatimtala.Rabindra Bhavan was the best place to be ,to know about the great poet Rabindranath Tagore. Here lie the personal artifacts, books, photographs. Few letters, paintings and the original manuscripts of the poet. Admissions to the museum is Rs.40 each and if you are a student with a valid ID Card then Its Rs.10 each. We left the place and while coming back we did few local shopping and left for the lodge. As there were no reservation done for the down train to Kolkata we hired a XYLO car from the lodge for Rs.1500 which would drop us to Bardhaman. After having lunch we left the place and reached Bardhaman and boarded the local train for sealdah.Train was mostly empty and we reached sealdah around 5.That brings us to the end of our Journey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:56:59.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
