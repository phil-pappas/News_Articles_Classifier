Sadly, and for a variety of reasons, only six programmes were produced, and all of them were filmed in Europe. To mark the centenary of Welles’ birth, the British Film Institute (BFI) has released all six episodes (featuring the Basque region – two episodes – Paris, London, Madrid and Vienna) in limited-edition DVD and Blu-ray sets. A seventh episode – which was to have examined one of France’s most notorious, and still unsolved, murder cases – was never completed, but has been reconstructed in a new documentary that is presented as an extra feature. Some full episodes and clips from Around the World with Orson Welles , which is now available from amazon.co.uk or the BFI website, can also be found on YouTube.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T18:09:48.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
