Here, lawmakers gave him another strong round of applause.\n“I am convinced that we can make a difference, I’m sure, and I have no doubt that the United States — and this Congress — have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies,” the pope said.\nA major global climate conference is scheduled for December in Paris. The goal — elusive in several previous such gatherings as rich polluters like the U.S. and developing ones like Brazil and China failed to reach agreement — is to strike a deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming.\nOn other issues, the pope called for a worldwide end to the death penalty — the U.S. is one of the few countries that still practice it — and denounced the arms trade as being fueled by hunger for “money that is drenched in blood.”\nThe pope also expressed concern over the fate of families, which he said are threatened like never before.\nIn particular, young people facing economic despair and other problems are discouraged from having kids, and others are so rich that starting a family is a distraction, he said.\nAfter his speech, the pope stepped out onto a balcony overlooking the National Mall and greeted tens of thousands of cheering well-wishers down below.\nHe switched to Spanish — “ buenos días ,” he said, eliciting a roar of approval — and asked God to bless the crowd. He also asked any non-believers or people who perhaps cannot pray “to send good wishes my way.”\n“Thank you very much and God Bless America!” he concluded in English.\nThe scene of multitudes mirrored that of Wednesday, when wildly happy crowds on the streets of Washington screamed and waved to the pope as he drove by in his open-sided pope-mobile.\nThe pope was to leave Washington later Thursday for New York, where he will address the United Nations on Friday.\nHe wraps up his historic six-day U.S. trip Saturday and Sunday in Philadelphia at an international festival of Catholic families.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/CWS8AZIpSFw?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-09-25T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T20:57:11.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
