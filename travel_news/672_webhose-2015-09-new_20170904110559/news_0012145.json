The great author, early train enthusiast and the man some would say invented tourism in Scotland with his dramatic and romantic re-imaginings of Scottish history, would have been delighted at this new lease of life for a part of the country so close to his heart. There were protests and demonstrations up and down the original Waverley railway route when it was closed in 1969; one of the many casualties of Dr Beeching’s report on British Railways. But it was a very different story on Friday when, more than 40 years and £294 million later, I joined the packed train setting off with huge fanfare from Waverley Station for its inaugural run to Tweedbank on the longest new stretch of domestic railway built in the UK in over a century. It is an unlikely and heartening triumph for the Campaign for Borders Rail, members of whom were onboard celebrating the new route and trading stories of their epic battle and hard-won victory. Adding to their sense of achievement, the Queen herself will officially open the service on Wednesday – the same day she becomes Britain’s longest reigning monarch; a recognition of just how special this restored railway is. • The world's busiest, longest and fastest railways The loss of this vital transport link isolated many borders communities, leaving the town of Hawick 50 miles away from its nearest railway station. It had a lasting impact on the region, particularly those dependent on tourism and textiles, as well as commuters travelling to Edinburgh for work. While the primary purpose of the new track will be to serve workers from the Borders region travelling to and from Edinburgh, the route is much more than a commuter train, and provides tourists with a great new opportunity to appreciate one of the most beautiful parts of Scotland from an entirely new point of view. The 55-minute service quickly left Edinburgh behind, winding through the former mining communities of Midlothian and into glorious countryside on a scenic journey through an enduringly lovely landscape. Horse riders from Galashiels Borders Ridings open the line On the 30-mile ride I saw stone houses, both great and small, and pretty villages easily marked by their sharp church steeples rising above the trees. There was a glimpse of a heron fishing in a sparkling river, a colourful cock-pheasant emerging from a deep, wooded copse, and then the great green and gold endless sweep of steep-sided border hills. The completed line is a rail-enthusiast’s dream, as I realised looking at the faces of other passengers. It has viaducts, tunnels and bridges galore - both restored and new - including 12 iron bridges across the Gala Water. And for those captivated by an earlier golden age of rail travel, there is an additional treat in store: from September 10 until October 18, special steam-hauled services will operate on the line. There is plenty to do once you get off the train, as well. The beguiling countryside is criss-crossed with more than 1,500 miles of walking and cycling paths, while the fishing on the Tweed makes dedicated anglers go weak at the knees. • Great British rail journeys: 10 of the best Attractions along the way are many too: from Eskbank station a taxi shuttle service will operate to the exquisitely intriguing Rosslyn Chapel - made famous by the novel and film The Da Vinci Code. Those with an interest in industrial and social history can alight at Newtongrange Station for the National Mining Museum at the Lady Victoria Colliery. But arguably the best is saved until the end. At Tweedbank, travellers can either walk (45 minutes) or jump on a bus to Melrose Abbey, a serenely stately, partially ruined Cistercian Monastery built in rose-coloured stone, where Robert the Bruce’s heart is buried. There are plans, too, to build a permanent home next to Tweedbank station for the Great Tapestry of Scotland - the largest hand-stitched tapestry ever made, a dazzling tour de force in needlework, telling the story of Scotland and its people. There is of course yet another prize awaiting those who reach Tweedbank: a 20-minute stroll from the station brings you to Abbotsford, Sir Walter Scott’s fascinating “'flibbertigibbet of a house”, a place where you can explore, eat and even stay in the home of this remarkable man. It is said that Abbotsford is a reflection in stone of how Scott’s fortitude led to his eventual triumph over adversity - not unlike that of the Campaign for Borders Rail, whose next ambition is to see the line extended the length of the original route, all the way to Carlisle.
