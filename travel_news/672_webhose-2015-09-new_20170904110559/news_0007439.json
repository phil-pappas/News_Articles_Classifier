The increase in passenger numbers highlights the benefits of offering travellers choice across a number of airlines to different destinations.\nThe biggest long-haul increase saw Orlando up 13.3% with passengers taking advantage of the offering from British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Norwegian Air, the only airline at Gatwick to serve all long-haul routes with the Dreamliner.\nThe short-haul sector also performed strongly with growth to European destinations +5.5%, the equivalent to over 167,000 extra passengers compared to last year.\nGatwick CEO Stewart Wingate said:\n“Airports Commission analysis predicted Gatwick would reach 40 million annual passengers in 2024 yet, in August 2015, we reached the 39.5 million passengers mark. We are in touching distance of 40 million and on track to reach this milestone within a matter of weeks. This is more evidence of the flaws in the Airports Commission and we will continue to make our case to Government as it approaches a decision. Gatwick remains the best and most deliverable option to actually deliver the runway that the UK needs.\n“While we are already at capacity at peak times, we continue to make substantial investment in the airport to allow us to continue to grow. This week, we reached the half-way point in our project to renew and revitalise our North Terminal which is part of our £2 billion transformation programme.\nSource:- GatwickAirport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T09:09:37.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
