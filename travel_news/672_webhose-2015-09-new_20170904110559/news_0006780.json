From this September the company will provide female event crew and technical support staff alongside their stage crew, technicians, production staff and promotional personnel. \nWith many events in the Middle East attended only by women, there is a need for can-do ladies who provide an extra pair of hands and ensure their successful delivery. Showforce’s newly launched female event crew offer a team of experienced, friendly and resourceful all female event crew. Launched primarily to cater for private events, weddings and galas they can assist with set-up, decoration, operate lighting and sound desks, follow spots and other technical elements. Showforce has a reputation for being able to provide the most experienced and highly skilled technicians from around the globe. Event organisers in the Middle East will often bring in internationally acclaimed techies which is obviously expensive. For certain projects they may be over qualified, in these instances Showforce can recruit technical support staff locally, with the right skill sets, and provide the organiser with a more cost effective solution. Ian Spendlove, Showforce’s founder and chief executive comments: “We have an in-depth understanding of the Middle East events market, this allows us adapt our services to meet the demands of the sector. Given the number of women only events and the customs and culture in the region providing female crew really makes sense. It’s vital that we keep in-step with what our clients want and it was becoming increasingly apparent that there was a requirement for capable techies who didn’t come with a massive price tag. Our technical support teams will bridge the gap well.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:49:34.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
