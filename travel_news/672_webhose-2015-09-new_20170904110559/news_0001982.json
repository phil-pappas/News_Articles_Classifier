Replacement of the ventilation units and installation of a probe-based control system will have a twofold benefit: balancing air pressure and eliminating heat stratification, i.e., the difference in temperature between the hangar floor and ceiling. Besides significantly reducing GHG emissions, these energy-efficiency measures will lower the building’s heating cost by approximately 30%.\nIn 2014, Air Transat became the first North American air carrier to complete the first stage of the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) Program, IATA’s seal of excellence for environmental best practices. In addition, in 2011 it received the first LEED-EB® Platinum certification ever awarded in Canada, for its head office building. And recently, the company installed four electric-vehicle charging stations, which it makes available to employees at head office.\nSource:- Transat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:46:33.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
