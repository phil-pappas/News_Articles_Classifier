It was sad because the program was devoted to the tribulations of the Virgin Mary, represented in music by composers of the baroque era. \nRegina Coeli ( Queen of Heaven) was the title of the concert in St. Patrick Cathedral. The tone was melancholy, for the most part, though there were a few outbursts of something akin to joy. \nKristin Van Cleve, the artistic director of Texas Camerata, has a talent for digging up beautiful music by little-known composers. Sunday’s program mostly was evidence of that talent, though with George Frideric Handel she slipped in a very well-known musician. \nJoining Van Cleve in the evening’s music-making were countertenor Ryland Angel, soprano Camille King, violinist Inga Kroll, viola da gambist Eric Smith, cellists Smith and Debbie Brooks, and organist Brad Bennight (Van Cleve is the group’s first violinist). \nThe one work that best represented the Camerata’s beautiful-music-by-little-known-composers tradition was a Stabat Mater by Giovanni Felice Sances, whose dates were 1600 to 1679. Sung by Angel, with accompaniment by strings and organ, this was a sad work with irresistible lyrical beauty. Here, as elsewhere throughout the evening, Angel was a strongly appealing interpreter. \nOne interesting experiment by Van Cleve was taking a four-movement sonata by Joseph Bodin de Boismortier and separating its constituent parts — each movement was separated from its neighbors by intervening music by other composers. The first movement was the opening work of the evening; the fourth was played near the end (and struck a rare lively note). The whole, if not quite great music, was certainly appealing. \nOne living composer was represented. He was Phil Kline, who was born in 1959. Angel sang his Alma Redemptoris Mater, which was quite lovely vocally, with some unusual instrumental sounds. \nHandel was represented by three works: a Salve Regina, music from the opera Theodora and Haec est Regina Virginum. Some florid passage work in the Salve Regina, sung beautifully by King, was reminiscent of many a Handel operatic passage. \nThere was also music by Alessandro Scarlatti and Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. The short life of Pergolesi, who died at 26, was one of music’s tragedies — a point made by Sunday evening’s moving Stabat Mater .
