Migration Cover is aimed at skilled migrants moving to Australia and New Zealand, with plans to roll it out to other popular destinations such as Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Chris Galway, the Australian brainchild behind the product, said it was designed to offer peace of mind for individuals and families by covering temporary and permanent repatriation costs. “Migration Cover is the first product of its kind designed specifically for migrants who face barriers in their new host country,” he said. “These include involuntary redundancy and long-term unemployment leading to full repatriation. We also provide cover for temporary repatriation, in case the family left behind becomes seriously ill or injured.” The policy is intended to take the sting out of costs associated with having to head home unexpectedly, such as shipping belongings, flying pets home, hiring a car, paying for temporary accommodation and booking flights. Chris Galway, the Australian CEO of Migration Cover, aims to help those moving to his home country Migration Cover also covers travel to the host country and employment advocacy – meaning if things don’t work out with your new job then advice from migration specialists and recruitment agencies is available. Recent immigrants who have relocated within the past two years and hold a valid skilled visa in their new country may also purchase the policy. It’s open to people from 26 countries including the UK, China and India. Mr Galway, who’s lived in London for three years, has a background in the military and educational standards industry. However, he came up with the insurance idea after noting the concerns of expats he encountered who had moved to Australia. He worked with insurance specialists to develop a product to address their needs. “It took a long time to achieve and test it,” he said. Migration Cover offers four levels of cover, basic, silver, gold and platinum, starting at around £460 for a single policyholder and £760 for a family. It’s offered to those aged 18-60 and there’s no limit on the number of dependent children covered under a family policy. Full information and Quote: s are available at migrationcover.com . The product is underwritten by insurers in the Lloyd's of London market. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:36:58.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
