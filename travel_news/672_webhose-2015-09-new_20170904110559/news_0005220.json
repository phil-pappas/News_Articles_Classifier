That general will now be called The Landing. Morimoto Asia will operate out of the building that previously housed Mannequins Dance Palace at Pleasure Island. The Boathouse restaurant, which opened this spring, and Jock Lindsey's Hangar Bar, which opened Tuesday, are also in that new district. \nThe Disney Springs expansion includes new retail outlets, more restaurants and two parking garages. The project is scheduled to be complete in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T16:49:43.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
