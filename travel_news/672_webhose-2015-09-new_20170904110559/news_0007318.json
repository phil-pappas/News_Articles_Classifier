Contact a travel clinic at least 3 months before you plan to travel. Here's a list of travel clinics for US residents.\nMalaria \nThere's a risk of catching malaria pretty much everywhere you travel in Kenya. The highlands used to be a low-risk area, but even there you have to be careful and take precautions. Kenya is home to the chloroquine-resistant strain of malaria as well as several others. Make sure your doctor or travel clinic knows you are traveling to Kenya (don't just say Africa) so s/he can prescribe the right anti-malarial medication. Tips on how to avoid malaria will also help. Safety In general people are extremely friendly in Kenya and you will be humbled by their hospitality. But, there is real poverty in Kenya and you will soon realise that you are far richer and more fortunate than most local people you meet. You will probably attract your fair share of souvenir hawkers and beggars, but try and take the time to meet ordinary people going about their day to day business too. The experience will be worth it. Don't be afraid to step out of that tour bus , just take some precautions.\nBasic Safety Rules for Travelers to Kenya Make a copy of your passport and keep it in your luggage. Don't walk on your own at night in the major cities or on empty beaches. Don't wear jewelery. Wear a money belt that fits under your clothes. Don't carry a lot of camera equipment especially in the major cities. Beware of thieves posing as police officers. \nRoads \nRoads in Kenya aren't very good. Potholes, road blocks, goats and people tend to get in the way of vehicles. When looking into a safari in Kenya, your choices of flying versus driving is a key factor in deciding on what places to visit. Here are some driving distances in Kenya , to help you plan your trip. \nAvoid driving a car or riding a bus at night because potholes are difficult to see and so are other vehicles especially when they are missing their headlights, a fairly common occurrence.

Car-jackings occur fairly regularly but may not end in violence as long as you comply with demands made. \nTerrorism \nIn 1998 an attack on the US Embassy in Nairobi left 243 people dead and over a 1000 injured. In November 2002 a car bomb exploded, killing 15 people outside of a hotel near Mombasa. Both attacks are thought to have been caused by Al-Qaeda. While these are scary statistics you can still go and enjoy your safari or the beach in Mombasa. After all, tourists haven't stopped going to New York city and security has improved in Kenya since 2002. For more information on terrorism check with your Foreign Office or Department of State for the latest warnings and developments. When to Go There are two rainy seasons in Kenya.
