(Photo: DC) Kochi: Stepping in to join the global trend of harnessing renewable energy sources, the city corporation has decided to make its new building being constructed at Marine Drive solar-powered. During a discussion with the officials of Switzerland-based PVT Power Company, Mayor Tony Chammany announced the civic body’s plans to tap solar energy for its new office. PVT Power Company chairman Demetrio Leone and co-founder Patric Leone held discussions with Mr. Chammany. During the discussion, the company representatives agreed to provide solar panels for the corporation which can power the entire office building. The civic body will not have any financial liabilities on the project and it will pay for the solar power generated at the rate fixed by the state government. Discussions were also held on converting the civic body’s all other institutions and offices to solar power. Deputy mayor B. Bhadra, standing committee chairpersons Soumini Jain, K.J. Sohan and corporation secretary V.R. Raju also attended the meeting. Earlier, the PVT Power Company held discussions with Greater Cochin Development Authority on installing solar power panels at Marine Drive walkway and shopping complex. An agreement will be signed soon between the two agencies on the project.
