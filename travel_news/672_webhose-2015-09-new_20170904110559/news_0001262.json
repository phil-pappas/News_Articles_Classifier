GasBuddy, the leading price comparison app that helps users find cheap gas, wants to alleviate the pain at the pump Angelinos suffer by providing record-low gas prices. The national average currently stands at $2.33 a gallon but drivers in Los Angeles are filling up for over a dollar more than that, at $3.35. In partnership with G&M Oil, this week GasBuddy will take over various gas stations throughout Los Angeles and Orange Counties, and surprise drivers with prices so low it will seem like 2009 again.\n“This year Southern California has been plagued with sudden and huge price spikes,” said Allison Mac, director of public relations for GasBuddy. “Our mission has always been to help people save money at the pump. This week we are taking it a step further and literally providing the cheapest gas possible to a city that could use the relief.”\nFrom Sept 16-18, GasBuddy will take over select G&M Oil stations and slash gasoline prices. In addition to filling up for a fraction of the average cost in LA, customers will also enjoy special deals such as free refreshments and other savings on convenience store goods by downloading the free GasBuddy app and G&M Mobile App.\nThe special discounted gas price is only applicable for vehicle fill-ups; containers of any kind will not be allowed. Diesel will not be included.\nBe the first to know where and when GasBuddy will be slashing fuel prices, by downloading the GasBuddy app available on iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows.\nAbout GasBuddy\nGasBuddy is the crowdsourcing pioneer, leveraging technology, big data and a passionate community to help drivers find cheap gas.
