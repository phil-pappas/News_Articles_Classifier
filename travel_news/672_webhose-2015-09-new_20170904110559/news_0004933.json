An overturned red Volkswagen marks the property along Mueang Phuket's Chalermprakiat Road. Once inside the quirky three-storey house, you'll discover that it is more than just a few tables and chairs glued to the ceiling. The owners, a Thai-Swiss couple, have spared no effort to make the house as realistic as possible, with toiletries in the bathroom, foodstuff in the pantry and toys lying around, as though the home is inhabited by children. There's even a real tuk tuk parked in the \"underground parking\". Upside-down aside, it's a pretty fancy house. \nYou're likely to spend 45 minutes, give or take, getting your fill of taking fun photos in the house. There are a few staff members to help you take photos, but for more convenience, consider going early on a weekday, because the attraction remains popular with locals off-season. If you have time to kill, Baan Teelanka also has an escape room, a garden maze and soon, an optical illusion graffiti area out front (for more photo ops). But don't fall into the trap of finding the house itself overrated simply because you don't know how to pose. \nHere are nine tips to help you make the most out of your visit: \nWide-angle lens / If you shoot with DSLR, be sure to bring a wide-angle lens, such as a 10-18mm, when you visit. Don't have a DSLR? GoPro, then. \nFocus on the furniture / With your camera, focus on the bed or table as if you were actually standing on the same surface. Your friends will have a hard time figuring out that all you did was flip the photo 180 degrees. \nTouch the ceiling / Try as best as you can to touch the things on the ceiling -- I mean, the things above you. This will make it look as though you're doing a handstand -- or being abducted by a mysterious force and hanging for dear life on to furniture. \nTouch the walls / If you can't reach the ceiling, play with the walls. \nLoosen your locks / If you have hair, especially long hair, don't tie it up. Slightly tilt your head for poses and let gravity do its work. This will add more drama to your photos by defying the laws of physics. \nOne foot on the ground / It's only fair that the people who work harder get better photos. Standing on one foot will make it less obvious that you're actually just standing there. \nLie flat / Don't be afraid to lie flat on the ground. Spread your arms out and keep your palms face down. This will create the illusion of your Spider-Man-like abilities. \nYogi it out / Don't let those months (or years) of training your balance go to waste. If you can actually do a handstand, do it. In pictures, you'll look as though you've levitated to touch the ceiling. \nAct / It's OK to smile at the camera as if to say, \"Hey ma, look at me, I'm at the upside-down house!\" But it's way cooler to pretend to be into what you're doing -- complicated gymnastics in your living room. There isn't a more appropriate time to take those pretentious candid photos. \nBaan Teelanka is located on the second kilometre of Chalermprakiat Road in Phuket's Mueang Phuket district. The attraction, including the escape room and maze, is open daily, from 10am-6pm. Admission to only the upside-down house is B340 for adults and B190 for children, with discounts for residents.
