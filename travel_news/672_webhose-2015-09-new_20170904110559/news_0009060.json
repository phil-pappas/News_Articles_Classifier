Some of the scales you find that are billed as travel scales would require their own bag to transport. This is one of the reasons that Dunheger scales have risen to the top of the listings when it comes to highly rated, high performance and travel sized digital luggage scales. Look at their digital luggage scale on Amazon and you can see the comments from satisfied customers that prove their products are designed by people that travel for people who travel.Digital displays that are easy to readOne of the most commented features of the digital luggage scale on Amazon by Dunheger is itâ€™s easy to read digital display. The special blue lit, back lit and easy read number design removes the guess work and strain from reading the weight result. This also makes it easier to use the luggage scale in different environments. You can get a quick read in your hotel room or the airport, but as many people have discovered you can also read it well outdoors. This can help greatly in trying to decide if you should buy an item to carry back, or if it should be shipped.One touch operationThe feature that customers love is the one touch operation design. The single large button turns the device on and off and zeros the scale as well. There are different mode settings you can access with the one button as well to change weight units and more. This allows for an easy one handed operation of the scale. Its light weight and ergonomic design make it perfect for everyone.The biggest change of allThe biggest change in features that make the current digital luggage scale on Amazon by Dunheger a true standout is the replacement of the traditional luggage hook with a belt strap type attachment. The hook has always been an issue. While it was convenient for older styles of luggage, the new style of luggage design led to items falling off the hook more than they stayed on. The added weight of the hook helps any digital luggage scale back from being considered truly portable. Add to that flight restrictions on hauling a sizable hook around in your check on luggage and it was time for a design change. The Dunheger designers created a quick release strap and buckle design that you can use with one hand easily. You get the weight, you get it fast and their new digital luggage scale on Amazon is returning high ratings for accuracy and durability too. Battery power is betterThe other change to the digital luggage scale on Amazon by Dunheger that customers are raving about is the use of AAA batteries for power. The first point in its favor is the scale is shipped with batteries included. The second point is that by using a global standard battery as a power source finding batteries on the road is easy. All in all, the new Dunheger digital luggage scale on Amazon is the one to beat, and the one you need to have.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nDunheger provides the most accurate, lightweight, portable, digital luggage scale on Amazon .
