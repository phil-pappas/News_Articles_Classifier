This operation has reached more than one million vulnerable people. \n“WFP, which is financed entirely by voluntary contributions from governments, companies and private individuals, is less than 25 per cent funded for the $81 million relief operation that lies ahead. “Additional contributions are urgently needed,” says WFP Representative for Malawi Coco Ushiyama. \nWFP also said a swift response is imperative to save children's lives and prevent worsening undernutrition, particularly stunting among children, which limits cognitive development, and has far-reaching effects on health and productivity over a lifetime. \n“A recent Cost of Hunger in Africa report for Malawi estimated that stunting, which at 42 percent is among the highest in the region, costs the nation nearly $600 million annually,” the agency said. “The WFP announcement comes a day after an appeal to the international humanitarian community made by the President of Malawi Peter Mutharika at the launch of the National Food Insecurity Response Plan on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T21:32:50.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
