Spectators, mechanics, drivers, musicians, dancers, actors and newspaper sellers must all dress up in clothes from the period between 1948 and 1966, when the circuit enjoyed its heyday. Goodwood staged the first international meeting after the Second World War, thanks to the endeavours of Freddie March, grandfather of the present Lord March, who opened it for competition. For the next 18 years it had a reputation as one of the most prestigious circuits in the world, but it closed in 1966 as the owners did not want to modify the layout to control the speed of faster cars of the era. Fifty years after that first meeting, in 1998, the circuit reopened and the Revival was born. This unique event recreates the original racing period in intricate, clever detail: everything from the circuit loudspeakers to the fish-and-chip wrapping must depict the age. And while the children whizz down the helter-skelter and circle the carousel, their parents get their kicks from the vintage aircraft parked on the former Battle of Britain airfield, the Spitfires and Merlins rising into the skies above the South Downs, as well as the serious racing on the track. Brands rich in their own heritage join in the spirit and offer something unique to the visitors With every sight comes the unmistakable soundtrack of Ferraris, Aston Martins, Frazer Nashes, Alfa Romeos, Fords, Porsches, Fiats and others blasting round the tricky double apex of Madgwick, past Fordwater and Lavant, diving into the tight chicane before the pit straight and zooming round the top of the circuit, just visible, always audible. Because of its existence as a perimeter road for the airfield, the circuit lacks the tight corners of many others, making it extraordinarily fast. It is difficult to say how big the part played by the cars is in most spectators’ experiences of the event. Unlike other forms of racing, it’s not just the machinery or the funfairs and memorabilia stores that entertain. Authentic: a Michelin shop on site Brands rich in their own heritage join in the spirit and offer something unique to the casual visitor. Thus you have a Tesco store, faithful to the period, selling goods in original packaging, with the queue to get in and shop for Fifties chocolate bars going three times round the shop at some times of the day. Then there’s Birds Eye, celebrating 60 years of the humble fish finger at Goodwood this year with a huge fishing boat parked on mounds of shingle right by the track. Michelin has played an integral role in road car technology and motorsport, both in the 1948-66 period and today, with its hugely consistent success in Le Mans (24 wins to date) and the World Rally Championship, and its recent technical partnership with Formula E . It entertained the crowds at last weekend’s Revival with a Sixties garage, replete with a 1964 Willys Interlagos Alpine Berlinetta with which the crowds lined up to pose. The garage, as with all the retail outlets at the Revival, had an authentic period interior, and throughout the weekend it demonstrated classic tyre changes using vintage equipment. Reproduction maps of World War Two battlefields, metal signs, tin mugs and posters from Michelin’s heritage collection were all for sale. Everything from the circuit loudspeakers to the fish-and-chip wrapping must depict the age The Telegraph caught up with Pascal Couasnon, director of motorsport at Michelin, on the stand, to talk about the strength of the bond between the brand and motorsport. “I bring young salesmen to the Revival because technology is much more efficient and quicker when there is passion,” he said. “Our philosophy is the right one and it has not changed. You keep your value by respecting the past.” Phil Baldock, Michelin’s communications manager, said: “Goodwood Revival ticks a lot of boxes for us, in that Michelin’s past is inextricably linked to its future. Innovation has been at the heart of the business for more than 125 years, and that has been the catalyst for developments that have helped shape the automotive industry we recognise today. “We have always used motorsport as a laboratory to accelerate tyre development, and Revival is the ideal showcase for that unparalleled success in competition. We are immensely proud of our heritage, and that heritage is extremely important to the Michelin brand – but Revival also gives companies like us the chance to talk about the future.” Top moments from this year’s revival 1 The Freddie March Memorial Trophy The Friday night race, which kick–starts the Revival, is a 90-minute dash into the dusk. As the sun goes down, the lights come on, and the two-driver race for Fifties sports prototypes gets into full swing. 2 Defender parade Fifty Series 1 Land Rovers (the Defender’s predecessor) took to the circuit each day to celebrate the last year of the model’s production. An astonishing array featured prototypes and even one built for the circus, complete with model elephant in the passenger seat. 3 “Seeing Red” The collection of Ferraris at the Earls Court Motor Show recreation had everything from a 1960 250 GT SWB to a 1950 166MM Barchetta. 4 The motorbikes The ones racing flat-out through the chicane, tyres scrabbling for grip and riders with knees almost kissing the tarmac, were as thrilling as those on display, such as the immaculate Indian outside the Old Control Tower. 5 Gordon shedden The Scot in his Ford Lotus Cortina on pole, plus Matt Neale, Jason Plato, Jochen Mass, Tiff Needell, Jackie Oliver, Rauno Aaltonen, Darren Turner, Mark Blundell, Karun Chandhok, Tom Kristensen and Andy Priaulx, racing in the St Mary’s Trophy Part 1.
