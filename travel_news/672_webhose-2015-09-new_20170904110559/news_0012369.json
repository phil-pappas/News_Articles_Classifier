Keeping the property intimate, only 35 guest suites and 25 pool villas will be available to book from Sept. 5. \nCultural immersion Ritz-Carlton designed Mandapa to immerse guests in the surrounding landscapes. Rice paddies can be seen from private terraces and a working rice field in the center of the resort will enable guests to experience planting, harvesting and tending the popular local crop. \nThe interiors by Jeffrey Wilkes of DESIGNWILKES use sustainable materials that blend traditional Balinese design with contemporary touches. \nRice paddies \nMandapa’s four restaurants will serve health-conscious fare prepared with local ingredients. Guests can also partake in “Dining Beyond,” in which a meal is specially designed and served in an exclusive space within the property. \nThe Spa at Mandapa will focus on six pillars of wellness: Balinese Spa, Detox & Nutrition, Alternative Therapy, Body Therapy and Healing. \nMandapa’s youngest guests can also access the keys to a greener lifestyle through interactive learning experiences. \nReserve resorts opened previously in Thailand and Puerto Rico, with future openings planned for Morocco, Panama and Mexico. The Ritz-Carlton is providing guests with a deeper meditation on its Reserve properties with a dedicated Tumblr that revolves around long-form storytelling. The deep-dives into each property will also feature video content and images to give fans a full sense of the destination. The brand’s first Tumblr foray will likely appeal to loyalists who want a more sustained interaction with the brand ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:50:51.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
