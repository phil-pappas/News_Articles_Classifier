(AP) â€” The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is offering fall tours of three facilities where salmon are removed from northern Michigan rivers.\nThe tours are available at the Boardman River Weir in downtown Traverse City, the Little Manistee River Weir in Manistee County and the Platte River Weir in Benzie County.\nWeirs are dam-like structures that block upstream fish passage.\nFisheries managers use them to remove salmon from congested areas or to capture the fish and harvest eggs needed for stocking programs.\nVisitors can learn about Michigan's fish hatcheries and how weirs and fish ladders work. Other topics of discussion include invasive species and the history of the state's salmon population.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://michigan.gov/huntfishcenter", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://michigan.gov/huntfishcenter", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:24:19.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
