And now it just happens to be our first exhibit.”\nThe Haiku Walk had a fortuitous origin. The Haiku Society of America, a nonprofit group that promotes the writing and appreciation of haiku, held a conference at the inn, and the organization’s regional coordinator, Julie Warther, was struck by the beauty of the site. She and Nies worked together to create the path.\nEach of the ginkgo-leaf-shaped plaques contains a poem in English and Japanese. The poems were written specifically for the Haiku Walk by 26 members of the Haiku Society.\nThe walk reminds me of a similar installation in Hartford Conn., where each short stanza of Wallace Stevens’ poem Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird is engraved on a stone along the route the poet walked each day to the office where he worked as an insurance executive. Though not haiku, the stanzas were inspired by the form.\nBut the Hartford route runs through busy residential neighborhoods and noisy commercial districts — hardly the most contemplative of settings.\nThe verdant woodland paths of the Inn at Honey Run, however, offer a quiet canvas — one that is perfectly suited for haiku, an art form with themes that often reflect upon nature.\nThe poems contain three very short lines: traditionally a five-seven-five syllable pattern that is often ignored by series haiku poets. The poems usually juxtapose two diverse images joined by a linking word or phrase.\nThe poems on the Haiku Walk are designed to evoke the four seasons, leading visitors through nature’s yearly progression of birth, fruitfulness, death and rebirth, such as this poem by Michele Root-Bernstein near the path’s beginning:\nsnowmelt \nthe liquid notes \nof a robin’s song \nAnd this by Amelia Cotter near the end:\nwoodland walk \nbeyond our footfalls \n. . . silence \nThe Haiku Walk is the first of what Nies hopes will be many pieces representing various art forms at the outdoor museum, which will be free and open to the public during daylight hours. Metal sculptor Jan Bowden, whose studio is near the inn, has been selected to install the next piece of art in early November.\n \n@SteveStephens", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T15:57:59.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
