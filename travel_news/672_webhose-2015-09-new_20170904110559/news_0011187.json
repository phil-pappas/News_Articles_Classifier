We have world-class medical facilities but awareness is still lacking.” \n\nMeanwhile, Mint Leong, managing director of Sunflower Holidays, added that the government should not impose a duration limit for the Chinese group visa exemptions and that it should cover FITs as well. \n\n“The high-end Chinese tourists don’t take group tours. We should also make it easier for them by removing visa requirements,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:26:21.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
