Cue the parody.\nActivewear\nBreaking a sweat ... NOT! Photo: Youtube/Skit Box Source: YouTube\nA group of Sydney comics, Skit Box, have taken the internet world for a spin with their latest parody production — literally mocking ‘girls who wear activewear, to do not-active things.’\nThe 2 minute video takes viewers through a relatively normal day — grocery shopping, coffee catch ups and even a trip to the movies. But each and every woman is donned in colourful crop-tops, vibrant visors and slick sneakers — without actually getting ‘active.’\nThe clip kicks off with a woman walking down Manly beach and running in to a friend. ‘Are you going to the gym,” she asks. ‘No,’ she replies, ‘I’m just going shopping in my activewear.’\n‘Going to the gym?’ No. Photo: Youtube/Skit Box Source: YouTube\nThe viral video has already raked up over 170,000 views on their Youtube channel\nHydrating in our activewear.
