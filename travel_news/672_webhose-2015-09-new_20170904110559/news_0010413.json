Picture: SUNDAY TIMES Related articles Stellenbosch council to reveal outcome of meeting later on Tuesday Stellenbosch report opens up to English Stellenbosch rejects ‘transformania’ tweet Open SA for local languages Writing is on the wall at our campuses THE council at Stellenbosch University has moved to support changes to the language policy at the institution, which could pave the way for it to become a fully fledged parallel-medium teaching university.\nThis follows a meeting of the 30-member council on Monday.\nStellenbosch is accused of marginalising non-Afrikaans speaking students, amid mounting pressure for it to change its policy to allow instruction in English.\nThe council, which has oversight responsibilities over academic and operational issues, has distanced itself from the views of one of its members, Piet le Roux, and mandated a five-member committee to investigate his pronouncements.\nMr le Roux seemed to denounce transformation, in a tweet that sparked an uproar.\nThe committee would report its findings and recommendations to the council three weeks before the council meeting on November 30, the university said.\nThe council also remained committed to the \"transformation journey\". It supported the recommendation by the rector’s management team that the word \"safeguard\" in the context of Afrikaans as an academic language should be removed from the introduction to the language policy, and also from the rest of the policy.\nStudent pressure group Open Stellenbosch says the university’s language policy \"safeguards Afrikaner culture\" and excludes most black students.\nLast week, the university’s language task team recommended that Afrikaans and English should have equal status as mediums of teaching.\nThe university also said qualifying words such as \"judicious\" and \"where feasible\" that related to the development of isiXhosa as an academic language would be removed from the introduction.\nThe proposed changes to the language policy will be tabled at the council meeting in November after consultation with the Institutional Forum and with the concurrence of the Senate.\nMeanwhile, Open Stellenbosch has continued its calls for the council to be dissolved, arguing that several members serve sectional interests.\nMr le Roux said on Tuesday: \"I am of the view that the rules of natural justice have been sacrificed in the steps taken with regard to me and I am currently seeking legal counsel.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:51:22.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
