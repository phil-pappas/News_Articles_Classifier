Jarvis . \"Thanks to our philanthropic partner, the National Park Foundation, fourth graders across the nation will experience the great outdoor and historic classrooms that parks and other public lands provide.\"\n\"In order to foster deep connections to America's national parks and all public lands and waters, we must introduce our young people to these incredible places early in life,\" said Will Shafroth , president and CEO of the National Park Foundation. \"We are proud to support the White House's efforts by providing critical funding through Every Kid in a Park transportation grants.
