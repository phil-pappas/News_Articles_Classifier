Walter Bibikow/The Image Bank/Getty Images \nThe Obama administration's new travel rules on Cuba don't let Americans travel unfettered to the nearby Caribbean island, but personal travel licenses are no longer required and Americans can now bring back prized goods like Cuban cigars when they visit. \nUnder the rules announced in mid-January 2015, Americans who want to visit Cuba still must fall under one of 12 long-standing categories of permitted travel, including: Family visits Official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments, and certain intergovernmental organizations Journalistic activity Professional research and professional meetings Educational activities Public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions, and exhibitions Support for the Cuban people Humanitarian projects Activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes Exportation, importation, or transmission of information or information materials Certain export transactions that may be considered for authorization under existing regulations and guidelines \nHowever, whereas travelers, tour companies, airlines, and other travel providers previously had to apply to the U.S. Treasury Department for individual travel licenses to go to Cuba, the new rules allow these activities under a general license. In other words, travelers won't need prior permission from the government to travel to Cuba: you'll just have to show (if ever questioned) that your travel falls under one of the 12 approved categories. \nSo-called People-to-People tours, already permitted under the law, operate under these rules because they are technically educational and cultural exchanges, for example. Flying to Varadero from Cancun on your own to spend a week at a beach resort would continue to be illegal. But the whole process would be more on the honor system than tightly regulated as in the past. \nThe bottom line is that the new rules seem to open a door to independent travel to Cuba for Americans, at least from third-country destinations that already have air links to the island and as long as travelers craft an itinerary that adheres to the approved travel categories. More cautious travelers can continue to join Cuba travel groups providing educational and cultural tours , safe in the knowledge that they fall under the rules and that the U.S. government isn't scrutinizing their activities nearly as closely as before. \nMore broadly, the more lenient attitude toward Cuba travel suggests that the day isn't too far off when Americans can freely book scheduled flights to Havana and book hotels directly -- although that day is not here yet. \nThe new rules, effective Jan. 17, 2015, also will allow Cuba travelers from the U.S. to: use their U.S. credit cards to make purchases in Cuba import up to $100 in alcohol and tobacco products, such as Cuban cigars bring back a total of $400 in Cuban souvenirs and products (including alcohol and tobacco) Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T03:31:27.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
