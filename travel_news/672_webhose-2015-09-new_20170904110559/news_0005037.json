At least 7,500 pre-orders are needed for the Department of Motor Vehicles to begin producing the plates. Orders can be made at www.pinkplate.org .\n\"Millions of California women and their families have been affected by breast cancer, and this is an opportunity to save countless lives and remind Californians about the importance of early screening,\" said Carla Kimball , a breast cancer survivor who credits early detection for saving her life. \"These plates are not just for survivors, or even the countless number of relatives and friends of survivors. The simple act of putting a Pink Ribbon License Plate on your vehicle will save lives.\"\nKimball is one of a group of breast cancer survivors calling themselves \"Survivor Sisters.\" They have fought for years to make pink ribbon plates in California a reality. Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 49, sponsored by then-Assemblymember Joan Buchanan , into law in September 2014 .\nFunds generated from the California Pink Ribbon License Plate will allow more women across California to get regular breast exams and mammograms, potentially saving the lives of countless women. The funds will be directed to the Breast Cancer Control Account, which funds the state's Every Woman Counts administered by the California Department of Health Care Services, which partners with county departments of public health and county health consortia across California to provide women with local, easy access to screenings.\nAbout 1 in 8 (12%) women in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime, and the disease remains among the top killers of women in California and across the United States . Breast cancer is also considered to be among the most treatable cancers when caught early. Breast cancer mortality rates have fallen dramatically in recent years, thanks in large part to advances in diagnostics and increased awareness about the importance of early and regular screenings.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150908/264604\n releases/pink-your-ride-breast-cancer-survivors-launch-drive-to-rev-up-orders-for-pink-plates-for-california-vehicles-300139452.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pink-your-ride-breast-cancer-survivors-launch-drive-to-rev-up-orders-for-pink-plates-for-california-vehicles-300139452.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.pinkplate.org/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150908/264604", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF96640&Transmission_Id=201509091330PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF96640&DateId=20150909", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150908/264604"], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:52:51.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
