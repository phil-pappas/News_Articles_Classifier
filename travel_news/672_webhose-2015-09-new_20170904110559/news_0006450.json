These five are Buddha, Himalayan, Coastal, Northeast and Krishna circuits. It has also envisaged an amount of Rs 700 crore for the development of these circuits.\nHowever, despite Meerut division being an important part of Mahabharata, the area has been left out. Now regional tourism office is planning to send a request to include the division too in the Krishna circuit.\nRegional tourism officer Amit Srivastava said, “There is a huge scope in this area. Over the years, Hastinapur has developed into a big Jainism pilgrimage spot and people from all over the country come here. I get a lot of phone calls from tourists who ask if there is any infrastructural facility in the wildlife sanctuary that could be availed. Hastinapur sanctuary is so close to the spot that people want to spend time in the wild but lack of proper infrastructure is an impediment. If a few rest houses are built in the forest area, not only villagers will get employment, the state can also earn revenue.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:20:59.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
