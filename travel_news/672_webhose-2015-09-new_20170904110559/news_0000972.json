Thieves and urban explorers have carted off polka-dot mushrooms, a pair of cement lions and, most hurtfully, pieces of the golden-hued path that runs through the park.\n“It’s magical,” says Vicky Conley of Morganton, N.C., who took her son to Oz last year when he was six. “People should leave it alone.”\nComing up on the one weekend each year when the park opens to the public, Page Leidy, whose family has owned the park for about four decades, isn’t sure how much longer he can play the man behind the curtain.\n“I am fighting every day to protect this place,” he says. “This magnificent place is becoming sadder and sadder.”\nMr. Leidy, 39 years old, is an unlikely champion of Oz. He is a New York real-estate developer and a regular on the Hamptons social circuit. Most friends don’t even know about the park, or that he dons overalls and a straw hat for the opening each fall.\nAnd, truth be told, he was never a huge fan of the movie. But for the foreseeable future, Mr. Leidy is effectively the sheriff of Emerald City.\n“I’m proud of my Oz,” he says. “Otherwise I wouldn’t have dressed up like a scarecrow.”\nHis family came to own Oz by accident.\nIn 1966, Mr. Leidy’s grandfather Page Hufty—an insurance pioneer and real-estate developer in Palm Beach, Fla.—bought land on Beech Mountain. His wife, Frances Archbold Hufty, was the granddaughter of John D. Archbold, a titan of the Gilded Age and John D. Rockefeller’s right-hand man at Standard Oil, which was dissolved by the government in 1911.\nMr. Hufty leased some of the land to other developers, who wanted a summer theme park to complement their ski resort.\nThe Land of Oz opened in 1970, amid much fanfare about the 70th anniversary of L. Frank Baum’s classic book. Debbie Reynolds stopped by. So did Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow in the 1939 movie. At least 300,000 people visited the first year, says Neva Specht, a historian and a dean at the College of Arts and Sciences at Appalachian State University.\nBy the second year, she says, it was one of the biggest attractions in the Southeast, and it graced the cover of “Southern Living” magazine.\n© Sean Barrett Visitors could walk the Yellow Brick Road, get pictures with the Wizard himself, and peruse a small museum with props and costumes from the film. In Beech Mountain, where the full-time population is about 350, locals referred to park employees as “Ozzies.”\nBut the park quickly became more of a white elephant than a Merry Old Land. Attendance dropped, as families were lured away by splashier attractions like Disney World, which opened the following year in Orlando, Fla. The developers went bankrupt, and Mr. Leidy’s grandparents eventually gained ownership.\nOz closed in 1980 and mostly sat dormant. The ski slope from the resort next door swallowed a big chunk of the property.\nWorried about the remaining eight acres falling into disrepair, Mr. Leidy’s mother came up with the idea in the early 1990s to reopen the Land of Oz to the public once a year. A couple hundred people came the first year, mostly friends and family. Mr. Leidy, then a teenager, popped the popcorn and collected trash. His mom, Frances Hufty Leidy, dressed up as a Munchkin.\nThe annual tradition has continued ever since, but numbers have swelled.\nFor this year’s opening, on Oct. 3 and 4, the park made available 7,000 tickets, at $35 each, which sold out in 2½ weeks—twice as fast as last year.\nOz can also be rented for private events and Dorothy’s house—before the tornado—rents for about $180 a night.\nThese days, Oz is kitschy and low-tech compared with modern theme parks. The Emerald City is mostly just a green door and some smoke machines. The Cowardly Lion’s lair is in disrepair.\nMr. Leidy says all the revenue from events goes into restoring and maintaining the park. Winged monkeys aren’t a problem, but harsh winters and effects of years of neglect are.\nMaking matters worse are the growing numbers of uninvited visitors. At nearby Appalachian State, an oft-told joke holds that most students have a yellow brick or two in their dorm rooms.\nDamage has been especially bad this year, according to Mr. Leidy. Pictures and comments on Instagram encourage urban adventurers to trespass there.\nMr. Leidy installed fences topped with barbed wire, but thieves cut through. Security cameras didn’t seem to deter anyone either. Mr. Leidy is now hiring guards.\nHe also talked to Shawn Freeman, chief of the 10-officer Beech Mountain Police Department, who said he has spoken with officials at local colleges, reminding them the Land of Oz is private property. But he stopped short of pledging to lock up trespassers. “We’re not here to cripple kids in their career,” Mr. Freeman says.\nA photographer by the pseudonym Seph Lawless, known for pictures of abandoned malls and decaying warehouses, included images of Oz in a book released this summer.\nMr. Lawless, who doesn’t disclose his identity, says he would like to see the park revived so it is open to the public more often.\n“It wasn’t like when I shoot an abandoned mall and people are like, ‘Oh, that looks horrible.’ I portrayed it as a beautiful place. It’s stunning,” he says.\nDonna Devereux, who played Dorothy when the park opened, agrees. She would also like to see the park put to more frequent use. But, “at least there’s not a huge condo on top of it,” says Ms. Devereux, an academic adviser at Appalachian State.\nMr. Leidy says he doesn’t know what lies in store over the rainbow, but thinks his grandparents would be proud.\n“Until we figure out a long-term plan here,” he says, “it’s important to me to protect it.”\nWrite to Christina Rexrode at christina.rexrode@wsj.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T19:21:02.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
