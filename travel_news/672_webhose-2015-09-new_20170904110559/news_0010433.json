The first is an open pairs betterball event on Wednesday October 7 and the second tournament is an open competition for teams of four on Friday October 23.\n \nBoth competitions include a bacon roll and tea or coffee on arrival, 18 holes on the spectacular Twenty Ten Course, and a two-course post-round meal with a prize table for winners.\n \nCeltic Manor Director of Golf, Spa and Leisure Will Hewitt said: “People still remember clearly the dramatic events of the 2010 Ryder Cup and these open events provide a chance for golfers to create their own special memories in team competition.\n \n“The Twenty Ten has matured into an even better course since we hosted the world’s best golfers and it presents a spectacular challenge for anyone playing in exciting events like these.”\n \nThe Twenty Ten Course was purpose-built for the drama of team match play with water featuring on nine of the 18 holes and risk and reward challenges lurking around every corner.\n \nFrom lacing up your shoes at the same lockers which still carry the name plaques of the Ryder Cup players to a post-round drink on the clubhouse balcony where Europe sprayed champagne over their supporters, every moment is special at this iconic golfing venue.\n \nEntry fees are £150 per pair for the open pairs event on October 7, and £300 per team of four for the open teams event on October 23.\n \nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T18:48:11.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
