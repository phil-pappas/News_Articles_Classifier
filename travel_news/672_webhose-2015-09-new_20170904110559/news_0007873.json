(AFP) \nFormer supermodel Gisele Bundchen has topped Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid models of 2015. The former Victoria Secret's angel has earned $44 million in 2015 even though she has retired from the runway, reports aceshowbiz.com. \nBundchen has topped the list for the ninth year in a row. Post-retirement, the Brazillian beauty continues to sign contracts with major brands like Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Carolina Stuart Weitzman. \nThe 35-year-old model even has her own label of lingerie titled as Gisele Bundchen Intimates. \n\n\nBundchen's position is undoubtedly unbeatable given that there is significant margin between her and the model at the second place of the list. \nBritish model Cara Delevingne comes after Bundchen with $9 million income this year, greatly increasing from $3.5 million in 2014. Adriana Lima is tied in the second place with $9 million income. \nAmong the highest rankers are a group of Victoria's Secret Angels, including Doutzen Kroes, Miranda Kerr and Alessandra Ambrosio at $7.5 million, $5.5 million and $5 million respectively. \nKarlie Kloss, Kate Moss and Kendall Jenner have also featured on the list.
