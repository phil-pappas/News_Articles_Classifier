Unusually, this private 5-day trek (as part of a 15-night itinerary) includes a support team of community porters, Village Ways guides, mules and tents, even when just two visitors are walking together – a truly privileged travel experience at a most affordable price (15 nights, £2,037pp with two sharing). And the larger the party, the keener the price. \nAn extraordinary tingle of adventure is guaranteed when walkers set out on their own expedition in the rugged heart of the Himalayas. The trails have attracted explorers since Victorian times, and the landscapes are on the grandest scale. From hospitable mountain villages in the high valleys, where visitors stay in Village Ways’ own comfortable guesthouses, the duo with their support team will trek for five days, staying in quality expedition tents or mountain refuges, on their way towards the magnificent Sukhram Glacier in the Sunderdhunga Valley. \nThe Sunderdhunga Valley – which translates as The Valley of Beautiful Stones – boasts expansive meadows fringed with rhododendron, waterfalls and streams, and of course awe-inspiring glaciers. The walking is spectacular, with paths winding up through the hills towards the towering snow-capped mountains. Climb through forests and pastures, past tiny villages clinging to the hillsides, to reach the great glacier. As well as porters and guides, the party will include a cook, so walkers can expect to eat heartily both during and at the end of a long day’s walking. The trek is quite demanding, with plenty of ascents but the routes are safe and the guides experienced. \nManisha Pande, MD of Village Ways, comments, “Like all Village Ways projects, the new trip will help to improve villagers’ lives by providing the remote communities with further sustainable tourism and economic benefit, whilst also practising sound environmental policies and leaving the area and its traditions untainted. Walking in this untouched corner of northern India is unbeatable; there is a sense of almost being within touching distance of these snow-capped Himalayan peaks, and the Glacier is an unforgettable sight.” \nThe trek is book-ended with a stay in Village Ways guesthouses in the mountain villages of Karmi and Dhurr in the Pindar Valley, and Jhuni and Supi in the Saryu Valley, providing visitors with a wonderful insight into life in these remote, beautiful valleys and leaving lasting memories. Among the highlights is a romantic night spent at Jaikuni in one of Village Ways’ comfortable tented camps. Here, perched on the ridge between the valleys, guests enjoy panoramic views back across the mountains they have just been crossing, offering an immense sense of achievement. \nPrice : A 15-night Great Glacier Adventure costs from £1,206pp based on 7 or 8 participants (rising to £2,037pp with 2 or 3 participants), including full board accommodation in the villages, at the Khali Estate and in the tents, two overnight rail journeys on the Ranikhet Express from Delhi, transfers, guiding and porterage. Flights are extra. Available 1 Oct – 10 Dec 2015 and 15 April to 31 May 2016. \nFor further information contact Village Ways (+44 (0) 1223 750049, villageways.com ). \nTwitter @villageways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:38:49.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
