United States, 11 September 2015 -- Come summer holidays, every parent is left wrecking their brains as to how to exhaust the huge amount of energy of their kids. During schools, the kids are busy with day to day activities but during vacations they get all the time in the world to do absolutely nothing and come up with the words that parents are so scared of hearing- ‘I am bored’. Parents often figure out ways to keep the kids occupied by getting new games and introducing them to hobby classes, but this can hardly use all the energy of the kids. And working parents cannot manage to be with them always despite the fact that they too want to spend more time with them.Come summer holidays, every parent is left wrecking their brains as to how to exhaust the huge amount of energy of their kids.

Camp Pathfinder is the best solution for all the parents during summer holidays. They arrange summer camps for boys where the kids can either go individually and meet a lot of new boys and make friends while enjoying a great adventure summer camp or they could go with their group of friends and have fun with them. The camp offers various activities like canoe trips, barbeque and bonfire, camping under the stars etc. This camping site is located on the Pathfinder Island, alongside Source Lake in world famous Algonquin Provincial Park.The camp boasts of well-trained experts who will take care of the kids every minute and ensure their safety while they have their dose of care free fun. An outdoor summer camp is always a much better idea than letting your kids waste their entire holidays in front of the tv or playing video games.
