A photo posted by Nick & Dariece (@goatsontheroad) on May 20, 2015 at 2:49pm PDT \nThey said they “fell in love” with Grenada and especially enjoyed trekking through wilderness and meeting nomads in Mongolia. \nSwift also said they received “unbelievable” hospitality in Iran, where families would invite the couple into their homes for a nights’ stay or a chat over tea. \nWharton admitted the distance from family and friends was be difficult but it was “less relevant” with the ability to communicate online. \n“Until there is a digital hug however, we’ll still return to Canada each year or so for a visit — or better yet, people come and visit us,” he said. \nWharton also said seven years abroad had completely changed his point of view. A photo posted by Nick & Dariece (@goatsontheroad) on Aug 22, 2015 at 8:13pm PDT \n“We’ve learned that media doesn’t always portray places and people the way that they deserve to be represented and there is often an ulterior motive behind many of the things that we see on TV back home,” he said. \n“We’ve learned that despite our endless differences and fascinating cultural uniqueness, we are all the same in this world. We all have the same core values and we all love each other. \n“We’re all human and we’re all in this together. That’s probably the most important thing that we’ve learned from travelling, and our life is better off just by knowing that simple truth.” \nThe couple now encouraging others to consider a similar lifestyle, and offer loads of travelling advice and tips on their blog.

Don’t put it off another day,” Wharton said. \n“Once you take the plunge, there are always safety nets that appear to cushion your fall. \n“One thing is for sure, if you’re heading on the right path in your life, then everything will work out and fall into place.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T08:38:39.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
