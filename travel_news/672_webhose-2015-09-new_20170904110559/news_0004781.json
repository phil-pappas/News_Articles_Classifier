The ginormous trains can reach up to 2.5km in length\nThe bulk cargo train Michal and Ammar travelled on. This is where they spent the whole night. They had to dig holes in the iron ore, against the edges of the wagon, to sleep in\nMichal sits on the iron ore train at Sahara using a scarf as a mask from the dust, with a spectacular Saharan sunset providing a dramatic backdrop\nHospitable encounters: Michal was offered tea by this group of travellers, who had a caravan of camels in tow\nThe pair boarded the Mauritania Railway in pitch darkness in the middle of the night, half-way through its journey from the iron plant in Zouérate to Nouadhibou on the Atlantic coast.\nMichal and Ammar were immediately forced to dig themselves into the iron ore cargo in fear that the suffocating sand storms would blow him off the train into the desert.\n Ruff and ready: Cute Instagram pictures show dogs enjoying...

Michal said: 'We dropped to the surface of the train and frantically began to dig holes in the iron ore with our bare hands, so that the wind doesn't blow us off.\n'A suffocating dust storm commenced - coughing and mildly swearing we continued to dig, and then fall exhausted in the shallow pits.'\nThe railway is the only way to get across the desert, and for many Mauritanians it is the only way they have to visit family and friends in distant places, or to find work.\nChinguetti is famous for its libraries, some of which contain works on science, astronomy and maths. This is the Al Ahmed Mahmoud Foundation Library, with its guardian awaiting those who seek knowledge\nThe Mauritania Railway begins at the iron mining centre of Zouerate and ends at the port of Nouadhibou on the country's west coast\nThe two explorers spent their night on top of the cargo train. In order to shield themselves from the dust, the pair dug holes in the iron ore to sleep in\nBoxes of pasta that travelled on the iron ore are quickly offloaded by workers as the train stops off along the route\nEarly in the morning Michal noticed that people began to emerge from the cargo around them, mostly men with their faces covered in scarves.\nMichal said: 'Bags around us that we didn't notice earlier were moving around us. We assumed it was the wind, but it turns out there were more people travelling like this.\n'We were as surprised to see them as they were to see us, now that they begin crawling out of their heaps of blankets, staring at us, then yawning and stretching.\n'We smiled, shook hands, waved, but didn't interact much more than that.'\nThe 700-kilometre journey across Mauritania reveals the stark poverty and arid conditions in the scorching Sahara\nShocking: When Michael stopped off in Ouadane, he was offered these two young girls as his wife\nThis is Port de PÍche, or Fishermen's Beach, in Nouakchott, the capital city of Mauritania. Men are holding a boat temporarily anchored to the shore so that fish can be taken out\nMauritania is Africa's second biggest producer of iron ore and it's export is essential to the economy of the country.\nThe train is also a free means of transport for local people and their cargo, who travel with cartons of pasta, rice, bottles of water and even live goats.\n'There are no planes, no trucks, and no other options to travel through the sweltering Sahara. If you try to drive and your car breaks down, you're as good as dead,' Michal said.\n'You see decaying tourist infrastructure here and there, forgotten concrete stumps and grey skeletons of buildings, while everyone is assuring you that the country is safe.\n'And they're trying - we went through over 50 military or police checkpoints in total, not at all convenient, but installed there for our safety.\n'We saw no crime, people were kind, showed some curiosity or ignored us. There are no inspectors, no tickets to show.'\nOuadane is now home to only 20 to 30 families - these empty houses must have once been teeming with life\nChildren smile for Michal, who photographed the local culture and houses along the route\nKind encounters: These women, inhabiting the centre of Eye of the Sahara, made some tea for Michal\nThe pair sweltered in temperatures above 50 degrees Celsius during the day and at night were engulfed by freezing winds.\nBut despite the harsh conditions, Michal was stunned by the size and beauty of the Mauritian desert.\nMichal said: 'We're riding a huge sandworm through endless dunes of this petrified sea, immobilised by geological rigor mortis.\n'Supposedly, when you greet people in the desert, you address them in plural, because you are referring to them and their guardian angel, as no one in their right mind would venture into the Sahara without their protection.'\nThe tower (left) is probably the most often photographed object in this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

There was a well, 30 metres deep, which was cared for by the entire community and not owned by anybody\nIn Chinguetti Michal's driver Ahmed looks at the barren road ahead, which nearly blends into the sandy landscape\nThis is what remains of the wreck of the United Malika. It used to be more complete, but now it's being taken apart, and you are not allowed to get close. The ship ran aground in 2003. This place used to be a ship graveyard, but there is now an ongoing EU initiative to remove the wrecks\nAfter roughly 14 hours, the train arrived in Nouadhibou. Unlike the romantic end of journey of the Lunatic Express on the other side of Africa, the Mauritanian train stopped pretty much in the middle of nowhere, with few surroundings except packs of taxi drivers awaiting the passengers\nA book from the collection at the Al Ahmed Mahmoud Foundation Library, in Chinguetti, famed for its libraries\nAn isolated village in Terjit, which has welcome shelter from the harsh desert, with trees and streams\nLocals battle the fierce winds and dust storms, as they are spotted from the train\nA local man passes the time in Ouadane, a settlement that only has a handful of families still living there\nThe oasis town, Chinguetti has always been struggling against the Sahara, and it has already had to relocate twice, being swallowed up by the relentless sands\nDespite the harsh conditions, Michal was stunned by the size and beauty of the vast desert that stretched as far as the eye could see", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://dailym.ai/1FKNas8"], "published": "2015-09-16T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:00:00.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
