The summit organisers, the Ecocity Conference Series Relay Committee (ECRC), awarded host status to the UAE capital after what it called a ‘clearly outstanding proposal’ submitted by Abu Dhabi Convention Bureau – a dedicated entity of TCA Abu Dhabi – in conjunction with the Environment Agency-Abu Dhabi (EAD), and its Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (AGEDI), and with the support of the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Company and Etihad Airways. \nECRC, a division of Ecocity Builders, the non-profit organisation dedicated to reshaping cities for the long-term health of human and natural systems, said several factors helped Abu Dhabi’s bid stand out, including its commitment to facing environmental challenges and supporting renewable energy, as well as its interest in ‘blue carbon sequestration’ – the absorption of carbon out of the atmosphere in mangroves and sea grasses. The summit is expected to attract upwards of 1,500 delegates and will feature an associated Ecocity exhibition. www.ecocityworldsummit.com Abu Dhabi Air Expo, February 2016 - The fourth Abu Dhabi Air Expo, the region’s leading general and business aviation exhibition, will be held in February 2016 in the UAE capital’s Al Bateen Executive Airport, the region’s only dedicated business airport.

The taxiway, airfield and the Sheikh Zayed Terminal will also be upgraded as part of the refurbishments. Up to 20,000 visitors and more than 175 exhibitors from local, regional and international companies are expected to attend the expo. www.abudhabiairexpo.com Global Cargo Conference, March 2016 - The Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC) has secured another lucrative conference to take place in the capital as Abu Dhabi ramps up its meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions offering. WCA, the world’s largest and most powerful network of independent freight forwarders, is bringing its annual WCA Global Conference to Abu Dhabi in 2016. With more than 5,700 member offices based in 191 countries around the world, the global industry networking conference is expected to attract 2,500 delegates to ADNEC from 10 to 16 March 2016. Being staged in the region for the first time, the annual event is now firmly established as the premier networking and business-generating opportunity for independent freight forwarders, and provides a platform for tens of millions of dollars of new business. Etihad Airways, the national carrier of the UAE, has been the Official Cargo Airline Partner for the WCA conference for the last four years, and has played a key role in supporting the organisers in their decision to bring the conference to its home base of Abu Dhabi. According to a report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the UAE will have the third largest international air cargo market in the world by 2018. It forecasts that the UAE will see freight totalling nearly 5m tonnes in 2018, behind only the United States and China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T11:48:30.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
