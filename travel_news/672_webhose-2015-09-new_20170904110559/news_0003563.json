The new menus currently available across Center Parcs have been designed by Executive Chef James Haywood to cater for a number of functions including breakfast meetings, lunches, receptions, gala dinners and banquets. \nThe new menus have been carefully constructed by the chef to ensure both balance and variety, and offer clients flexibility when it comes to providing a menu that will satisfy specific requirements. Clients can choose from a vast range of dishes, each using fresh, high quality ingredients, with the option of menu upgrades at a supplementary cost. Culinary highlights include Norwegian prawn cocktail on a baby gem salad, shredded cucumber and grilled sourdough bread; Pavé of beef on a buttery mashed potato, haricot vert and mangetout served with a smoked bacon and mushroom sauce; and Crispy confit duck leg, lyonnaise new potatoes, braised red cabbage and rosemary jus. For dessert, delegates will be treated to delicacies such as lemon and lime mousse with a passion fruit sauce and crushed dried raspberries; French apple tart with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce; and strawberry and clotted cream mousse with crème Chantilly and crushed pistachio nuts. Executive Chef James Haywood, says: “From start to finish the whole process of developing new menus for Center Parcs takes around four months and includes initial development, exploring the market place and current trends, meeting with suppliers and our food and purchasing department and devising and testing the dishes. Once the final menus have been confirmed we spend three days training our executive sous chefs and head chefs at each Village. “Due to the huge amount of work and resource that goes into our menus we change them every 18 months. To meet the demand for more variety among clients and guests, we have devised around 14 live core menus across Center Parcs, which feature fresh, high quality ingredients that can be selected and enjoyed year-round.” Ryan Gray, Head of Sales, says: “We are very proud of the catering we have on offer here at Center Parcs. We have a truly skilled team in each kitchen across our five sites who are dedicated to providing clients, delegates and guests with dishes of the highest quality. Our Villages are able to offer a significant range of dishes to ensure that we are able to cater for any client requirement or budget.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:02:33.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
