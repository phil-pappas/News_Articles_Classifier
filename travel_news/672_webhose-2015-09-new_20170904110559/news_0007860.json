TPB also plans to tap the luxury market, with consumer outreach plans already in the works. \n\nWith the travel advisory lifted, Cesar Cruz, president, Philippine Tour Operators Association, said that the Philippines “can now market and promote openly” in China. \n\nHe commented: \"Chinese tourists can really compensate for the decreasing arrivals from certain countries including Russia and South Korea, the country’s biggest source markets, which for the first time posted decreases last year. \n\n“They are a boost to Boracay, their main destination, and Cebu and hopefully, Manila,” he said, adding that the return of the Chinese tourists is likely to be felt more during the high season between December and February.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:26:24.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
