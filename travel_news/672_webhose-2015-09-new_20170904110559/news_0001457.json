The only sounds are birdcall, the putter of small fishing craft as they pass, and the splash of fish as they are caught in nets.\nCruising upriver we pass some of the oldest wooden villages in Myanmar as we venture into the remotest and most northerly navigable points on the Chindwin River, almost to the border with India, then on to the Upper Irrawaddy, close to China, and down again. Our adventures take us deep into Myanmar to places with romantic names such as Ava, Amapura, Mingun, Monywa, Inn-ywa, Mawlaik and Tagaung Ancient City.\nIt’s as if we’ve entered a time warp. The river people have no electricity or modern conveniences. Villagers sleep on rattan mats in stilt houses.\nThe RV Katha Pandaw is part of Asian cruise company Pandaw’s fleet of nine brass and teak steamers, replicas of the old colonial steamers that used to ply the Irrawaddy as part of the former Irrawaddy Flotilla Company.

Eager hands reach out to offer us fruit and flowers. With only a few boat visits each year, it is a rare opportunity for the locals to see foreigners.\nMost memorable are stops at remote villages not even marked on maps.\nToothy red betel nut grins and ghostly, thanaka-painted faces are everywhere. Made from grinding the root of a tree, the paste is a beautifier and sun protection all in one.\nEach day, when our boat pulls into shore to yet another isolated village, the crew hack steps into the muddy embankment. We grab hats, good walking shoes and scramble ashore on foot to explore the village.\nPandaw’s clientele are mature-aged, well-heeled and enjoy travelling in comfort but intrepid enough to enjoy a bit of adventure and a good slosh through the mud in their Kathmandu gear or Panama hats and waterproof boots. No lying around a hotel pool sipping cocktails for them.\nThe sights keep coming: the ancient teak carved wooden monasteries in Mandalay (the Golden Palace Monastery or Shwe Nan Daw Kyaung), at Innwa (Bagaya Kyanug monastery) and at Kan.; the Shan enclave of Sitthaung; Pagan with its more than 4000 temples, including Shwezigon; the huge unfinished stupa Mingun Paya and Mingun Bell, the second largest in the world, U Bein, the world’s longest teak wooden bridge at Amarapura and an iconic image on postcards of Myanmar.

Just south of Monywa is the incredible golden pagoda, Moe Hnyin Than Boaddai (Thanboddhay Paya) covered in more than 500,000 Buddha statues and, nearby at Bodhi Thataung, the 125m Giant Standing Buddha and the largest Reclining Buddha in the world (taller than Christ the Redeemer in Rio).\nFinally, the Katha reaches as far as it can go. We are in the most northern navigable reaches of the Irrawaddy in Kachin State at Katha, one of the most difficult places to get to in the rugged precincts of northern Myanmar, and the setting for George Orwell’s novel, Burmese Days .\nMy lasting memories of Myanmar are of the gold leaf spires on the stupas that line the river and in every village, no matter how poor, and the people — the women pedalling ancient sewing machines, the barefoot men in conical hats ploughing rice paddies behind oxen, and villagers washing their bodies and their clothes in the river. The temples at Bagan.

And you can too. Get in early before the magic is lost.\nGO2\nMYANMAR\nPandaw offers a 10-night cruise of Pagan and the Upper Irrawaddy, Pagan-Katha-Mandalay and a 20-night Chindwin and Upper Irrawaddy cruise in Yangon/Kalewa-Katha-Mandalay.\nPrices start from $5090 a person for the 10-night cruise or $9970 a person for the 20-night cruise. Local alcohol, drinks and tips for crew, daily excursions, and a flight from Yangon to Kalewa for the start of the cruise are included in the price.
