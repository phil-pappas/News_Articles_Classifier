Given its success, Peninsula has reworked the effort to include 10 limited-edition SnowPages for 2015, each modeled after a specific hotel in the brand’s portfolio. \nSnowy ambassadors To redesign the SnowPages, Peninsula worked with luxury toy-art collective Papinee. Each hand-made SnowPage is dressed with luxurious fabrics and detailed embroidery linking the toy to the hotel it is meant to represent. \nOverall, there are 10 exclusive limited-edition SnowPage toys, one for each hotel, priced at $75. Hong Kong-based Papinee has only created 300 SnowPage for each city. Peninsula operates properties in Hong Kong, Beijing, New York, Tokyo, Paris, Bangkok, Shanghai, Chicago, Manila and Beverly Hills, CA. \nFor instance, the Bangkok SnowPage is dressed in gold with embroidered elephants and traditional Thai patterns while the New York SnowPage was inspired by the Art Deco movement expressed in red, white and blue colors. \nPeninsula’s 2015 SnowPages. From left to right, Beijing, Paris, Tokyo and Shanghai \nA number of the SnowPage boxes will include a golden ticket, a la “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,” that can be redeemed for bespoke Peninsula experiences, designed to create memories for the entire family. \nGolden ticket prizes include a two-night stay for four in the top suite of a Peninsula hotel, a dinner for four, daily breakfast plus a Peninsula Academy family experience including picnics, making and flying kites, learning to prepare dim sum dumplings, desserts and more. Other prizes include dinners for four and Peninsula afternoon tea sets. \nEach holiday season, Peninsula centralizes its efforts around the SnowPage mascot. Centralizing its holiday efforts around the SnowPage symbol may grant Peninsula’s various offers a dose of unity, while acting as an anchor in the busy holiday season ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:57:24.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
