An experienced team of professional engineers from AJW will manage all aspects of the shop visit, supported by the strong commercial acumen of the engines division as a whole. AJW Engines has also negotiated the contractual terms with the chosen MRO on behalf of JSC Donavia.\n“The Engine Management Service (EMS) we offer is a tailored service whereby we continuously update the customer regarding all processes on a daily basis. In addition, we challenge the MRO to justify their repair choices keeping everyone focused” explains Morgan Brown, Powerplant Engineer – AJW Engines. “This approach not only helps to safeguard the airline from unnecessary expense but also ensures they operate at maximum efficiency and safety. The AJW Group is recognised for its flexible approach across all aircraft support options and the EMS programme for JSC Donavia combines special introductory rates and volume discounts.”\n“When AJW supplies a replacement engine part on behalf of JSC Donavia from our comprehensive stock, each part is accompanied by complete industry standard paperwork. Our main objective is to keep the shop visit cost to a minimum. We also ensure the agreed turn-around-times are adhered to, and that the optimum performance to achieve the longest on-wing time is achieved. AJW also supplied hard-to-source Life Limited Parts for the first shop visit this month and, in conjunction with the EMS general terms agreement, JSC Donavia also signed a long term lease agreement with AJW Leasing for support with a replacement engine whilst their off-coming CFM56-5B goes into shop.”\nOperators looking for engine management, inventory consignment or parts supply can rely on AJW Engines. This growing commercial jet engines division has developed a significant aircraft engine portfolio and offers a range of integrated management solutions providing engineering services and quality overhauled condition engine parts. AJW Engines offers a wide range of CFM56-3/5/7, PW2000/4000, RB211-535E4 and V2500 sales and purchasing opportunities. JSC Donavia has been trading with AJW Engines for some time and has purchased many complete sets of CFM56-5B fan blades through AJW’s unique fan blade exchange programme. AJW is also developing a material salvage programme to recover and repair many of their unserviceable shop visit materials.\nSource:-AJW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:07:15.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
