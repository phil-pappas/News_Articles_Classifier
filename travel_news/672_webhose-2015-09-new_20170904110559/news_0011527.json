Researchers have found that forgiveness leads to fewer symptoms of depression in women than men regardless of whether it is complex process or leads to fraught and angst. \nAs per the University of Missouri College of Human Environmental Sciences study, it is believed that aging adults' reported feelings of depression sans forgiveness whereas, older women, who could easily forgive, were likely to report lesser depression. \nCo-author Christine Proulx quoted that it doesn't feel good when people perceive that others haven't forgiven them for something, adding that when humans think about forgiveness and characteristics of people who are forgiving, like altruistic, compassionate, empathetic, they forgive others and seem to compensate for the fact that others aren't forgiving them. \nResearchers say that it is surprising to find that forgiving oneself did not reduce levels of depression in men and women who feel un-forgiven by others. \nHowever, as per Proulx, self-forgiveness didn't act as the protector against depression; it's about whether individuals can forgive other people and their willingness to forgive others. \nThe study is published in July in Aging and Mental Health.
