Each series will offer two Halal menu options, while one series will cater for vegetarian diets. \nEvent planners are able to swap dishes from menus in the same series at no extra cost, while changes made between menus from different series will come with “a little bit more money”, said Suntec Singapore’s CEO, Arun Madhok. \nDescribing the new banquet programme as a revolutionary one in the MICE business, Madhok said: “Venues in the market today typically offer only two or three set menus with fixed items. We see the opportunity to do things differently and better by giving price-sensitive clients who appreciate good food the chance to provide their delegates with a great dining experience at Suntec Singapore, but without breaking the bank.” \n“Industry colleagues have told me that my new banquet programme is suicidal for business; how could the kitchen manage so many dining options for multiple large-scale events, they asked. But this is not an issue for us, as our kitchen operations have been computerised and optimised with new processes,” he said. \n“Take for instance our new induction ovens which can cook many dishes at once but are safe and use less heat, which also brings down electricity usage as our air cooling system will no longer need to work as hard. We have also reduced the number of suppliers, keeping only the top quality ones and employing a Just In Time delivery system to keep produce fresh and use less storage space.” \nTo spread demand away from the popular Friday and Saturday evenings, Suntec Singapore is offering a discount of S$50++ per table for banquets hosted on Sundays to Thursdays. \nAll menus come with free-flow soft drinks and Chinese tea, fresh flower centrepieces, one VIP table service per 50 tables booked, and other perks.
