According to a new survey by G6 Hospitality , known for its iconic economy lodging brands, Motel 6 and Studio 6, more than half (54 percent) of travelers admit they have left something behind in a hotel room. The \"Motel 6 Left Behind Survey\" conducted by Kelton Global found that 29 percent of Americans are more likely to accidently leave a belonging behind in a hotel room than take a hotel item, such as shampoo or soap, home with them.\nI'd Lose My Head If It Wasn't Attached\nTravelers may not be losing their heads but three percent have left behind false teeth or hearing aids. Vacationers were not shy about sharing their travel truths. From their most cherished childhood keepsake to a pair of underwear, Americans reveal the top items they've left behind throughout their travels:\nClothing (42 percent) Toiletries (42 percent) Electronic devices/chargers (40 percent) Jewelry, including watches (15 percent) Underwear (13 percent) Hair styling tools (13 percent) Reunited and It Feels So Good\nThe saying goes, \"what's lost can never be found,\" but over one-third (35 percent) of Americans have returned to a hotel to retrieve what they forgot. In fact, on average, respondents would travel:\nOver 110 miles to reclaim their money or wallet Over 95 miles to recover their electronic device Over 30 miles to pick up a forgotten device charger In the case that they are not willing to go the distance, the survey uncovered that Americans would be willing to spend up to $90 to replace an item they forgot in a hotel, on average.\nGeneration Lost\nAlthough a majority of hotel-stayers look twice before leaving their room, millennials are less likely than older generations (74 percent vs. 84 percent) to do so. In fact, millennials admit to losing four items in hotel rooms in the past, compared to older Americans who have abandoned three items across all of their travels. Interestingly, 38 percent of millennials have turned around to retrieve their items, compared to fewer (33 percent) non-millennials.\nIf Found, Please DON'T Call\nWhile leaving items in their hotel room is mostly by accident, Americans would gladly leave a family member at home before embarking on their vacation. More than one quarter (26 percent) of married Americans admit the family member they'd most like to leave behind is their in-law. Just one in ten (10 percent) respondents said this about their own parent.\nA ll is Not Lost\nWhen it comes to party lines, all is not lost. Democrats would spend more money than Republicans ( $84 vs. $59 ) to replace something they have left in a hotel room. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to scan the room to make sure they don't leave an item behind (86 percent vs. 78 percent). Likewise, Republicans disclose they would travel further than Democrats to reclaim their money or wallet (119 miles vs. 93 miles), ID or passport (118 miles vs. 85 miles) or childhood keepsake (86% vs. 50%).\n\"Motel 6 is a household name, synonymous with quality and value,\" said Lance Miceli , G6 Hospitality Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. \"The quality of the stay we provide is just as important as the valuable relationships we forge with our guests. Therefore, if you are among the one-third of Americans that will come back for a lost item, Motel 6 will be sure to leave the lights on.\"\nFor an infographic summarizing the \"Motel 6 Left Behind\" survey results, please click here .
