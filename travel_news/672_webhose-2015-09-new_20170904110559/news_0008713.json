Well, the place was SO damn beautiful, it could steal every shot.\nNo doubt about it, Pine Cliffs is the sort of picture-perfect spot made for social media envy – and our models were soon holding up their smartphones taking selfies for Instagram.\nSelfie time: The bikini girls on film\nThe uploading continued at our townhouse apartments, which had the feel of chic, metro living.\nEach bedroom had a luxury bathroom and acres of wardrobe space (pretty ­essential for all the beauty ­products and bikinis that came tumbling out of suitcases).\nPine Cliffs is less than four hours from Gatwick so we were feeling fresh and relaxed as we arrived for dinner at the resort’s O Pescador restaurant.\nWith the focus on fresh local seafood and veggies, even our bikini babes could tuck in and feel both sated and smugly healthy.\nClassy: Pine Cliffs Residence in Portugal\nThen they averted their eyes as the rest of us dived into divine puddings.\nNext morning it was showtime, and we headed for gorgeous Falésia beach, reached by a panoramic glass lift down the cliffside.\nOn the way we passed the pools, golf club, tennis academy and huge playground with giant wooden pirate ship (my kids would have loved it).\nThe beach stretches for miles – in one direction there’s Vilamoura and its upmarket marina while buzzy Albufeira is the other way. But for us, Pine Cliffs was a jewel nestled between them.\nIt’s not just about the luscious setting (as any model will tell you, looks only get you so far). It’s about personality too, and every member of staff there has us charmed.\nA stunner Pine Cliffs may be, but its beauty goes well beyond skin deep.\nTravel File Getting there: Monarch flies to Faro from Birmingham, Leeds, Gatwick, Luton and Manchester from £37 one way/£79 return. monarch.co.uk\nBook it: Double room from £200 B&B for two sharing. pinecliffsresidencesuites.com\nComing soon: By next summer Pine Cliffs will have a five-star hotel and 76 new two-and three-bedroom luxury Ocean Suites.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.monarch.co.uk/", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.pinecliffsresidencesuites.com/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-09-14T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T20:33:16.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
