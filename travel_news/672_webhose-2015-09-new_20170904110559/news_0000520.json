His first two four-year terms as president do not count because they were won under a previous constitution.\nOpposition legislators put up a noisy fight, first attempting to thwart the measure through procedural means. When that failed they engaged in a heated back-and-forth with Morales supporters, sometimes climbing on their chairs to make their point.\nHenry Cabrera with the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), the president’s party, contrasted Morales’s “Process of Change” program with the right-wing governments of the past that “wreaked havoc on the country’s economy.”\nOscar Ortiz, a leading opposition leader, snapped back by accusing top government officials of funneling money from an agriculture program into their personal bank accounts.\nSee also: Bolivia’s Evo Morales: Obama should lift the embargo and return Guantánamo Naval base to Cuba\n“When the opposition opposes reforming the constitution they want to block the … will of the citizens, and of course we will not allow that,” said pro-government legislator Oscar Baron.\n“Facing the inevitable,” said opposition legislator Jimena Costa, “the only thing that is left is to campaign for a no vote in the referendum.”\nMorales, the longest-serving president in South America, benefits from a fractured opposition that has failed to rally behind a single leader.\nOn Friday, the Bolivian president called for an end to “dictatorship” of the capitalist system at a United Nations development summit in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:12:35.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
