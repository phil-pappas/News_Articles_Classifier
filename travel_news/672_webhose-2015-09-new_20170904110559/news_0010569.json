This proves that this is the fastest way to boost arrivals.” \n\nRizal said the new regulation would be implemented in October to ride on the momentum of the year-end holiday season. \n\nAccording to minister of tourism Arief Yahya, the growth potential of India, Australia and Taiwan, which contributed one million, 200,000 and 300,000 arrivals respectively, was one of the reasons for including this trio in the latest round of visa exemption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T08:52:09.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
