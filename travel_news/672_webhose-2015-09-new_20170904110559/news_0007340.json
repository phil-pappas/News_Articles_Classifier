For four days, from 3-6 September, the showgrounds will play home to more than 200 boats, as well as the latest in boat trailers, fishing rigs, water ski and wake boats, canoes, kayaks, tinnies, jet-skis and more – all to the delight of the 15,000 Brisbane Boat Show guests. \nLovers of the great outdoors will be in heaven with non-stop action including the live weigh-in of the Australian Bream Tournament and a chance to see the Yamaha Supertank and Kids Marine Zone. Queensland fishing personalities Jason Medcalf and Jason Ehrlich will be sharing their fishing tips along with other guests on the Keep Australia Fishing Stage. RNA Chief Executive Brendan Christou said this was a great family event that showcased the diversity of the Brisbane Showgrounds. “Just last week we hosted the who’s who of the Australian fashion industry at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Festival, now we’re hosting fishing and boating aficionados from across the state,” Mr Christou said. “It’s a testament to the venue and staff that the iconic showgrounds can be seamlessly transformed to suit a range of events. “We are looking forward to a successful show over the four days, followed by more high profile events in the coming weeks including guest speaker Sir Richard Branson at the Titans of Real Estate seminar.” The 22 hectare Brisbane Showgrounds precinct is located just 1.5km from Brisbane’s CBD and is Queensland’s largest indoor / outdoor events site.
