(Photo: Ryan Mac/ Forbes)[/caption]GoPro marked its first anniversary as a public company in June, but CEO Nicholas Woodman didn't have much to celebrate on Tuesday. Speaking at the annual TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, GoPro's founder, battling the flu and investor discontent that has sent the company's stock price down 55% in the past 12 months, hinted at future plans for new gadgets and software that he hopes can help to reverse the sentiment that his company is just a one-hit wonder.GoPro's point-of-view cameras pioneered a new category of consumer electronics, but the company has suffered from doubts that it will be able to go beyond that. Those questions have taken the San Mateo, Calif.-based company's shares within touching distance of its $24 initial public offering price. Earlier this month, Barron's published a damning piece noting that GoPro's stock could fall even further citing the fate of other device-dependent companies like Blackberry and the possibility of [entity display=\"Apple\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"apple\" ticker=\"AAPL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/280\"]Apple[/entity] moving into the market.While speculation about competition from Apple was partly based on seemingly insignificant camera-related patent that Apple purchased earlier this year, it's been a thorn in Woodman's side, who had to fend off rumors of an acquisition on Tuesday.\"You guys just love the drama,\" he said, when asked by the on-stage moderator if he'd work out of an office in Cupertino, Calif.--insinuating the possibility of an Apple buyout.\"I don't think Apple is building GoPro-like devices,\" Woodman added, reaffirming a position he explained to FORBES in June.Woodman also used his 20 minutes on stage to explain his company's central problem: video editing. Over the years, GoPro's users expressed their frustration with the fact that it takes hours to edit footage into meaningful content that can then be shared with friends and family. Woodman recognized the problem, noting that a GoPro cameras were currently like \"an iPod without iTunes.\"To that end, GoPro's CEO said that the company was building out a cloud-based service that will make it easier to sift through, cut and publish videos. Woodman called it the company's \"big software initiative,\" and while it's taking longer than expected, he says that early tests--including one from a recent diving trip--have allowed users to edit footage in minutes from their GoPros and mobile devices.As for the cameras themselves, Woodman said that the company's newest device, the Hero4 Session, was not selling as well as expected. Despite being smaller and cube-figured unlike the company's earlier rectangular cameras, the new camera was facing stiff competition from GoPro's other product lines, namely their Hero4 Black and Silver editions.\"It’s going well, but it’s not what we’d expect simply because of how strong Silver and Black are,\" he said without disclosing actual sales figures. \"As sexy as it is, it's selling against best-selling cameras in the world which are thankfully GoPros.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.barrons.com/articles/gopro-investing-as-an-extreme-sport-1442637822?mod=BOL_hp_highlight_3"], "published": "2015-09-23T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:53:41.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
