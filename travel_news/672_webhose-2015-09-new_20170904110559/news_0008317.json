The food is specially prepared by Yubahachi.\nANA has been introducing Japan’s local food through its project called “Taste of Japan”.\nYuko Arai, Senior Vice President, ANA, said, “One of the most popular foods for Japanese people is soybean. In Kansai region, Yuba is very popular for soybean food. That’s why we picked up Yuba.”\nYubahachi is a long-established company of Hiei-Yuba. The company has been promoting its food the world over.\nSachiko Yagi, Hieiyuba Honpo Yubahachi Co. Ltd., said, “The special thing about Yuba is that it doesn’t discord from other ingredients; rather it makes other ingredients elegant. I want to make Yuba as common food in the world. My ultimate dream is to make many people addicted to Yuba.”\nJapanese products are reaching the world over as many retail companies from Japan are setting up their facilities in many countries.\nAEON has recently announced that it will open a second shopping mall in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.\nMakoto Yajima, Managing Director, AEON (CAMBODIA) Co., Ltd., said, “In order to respond to the changing market needs by the acceleration of the ongoing commercial facility project developments in Phnom Penh city, we officially announce the development of the second shopping mall.”\nWith the opening of the first AEON mall in Cambodia, the residents in Phnom Penh have experienced a wholly new shopping environment, which revealed the new era of consumerism in the country.\nThe mall has drawn over 15 million visitors since its opening a year ago.\nYajima further said, “This number is comparable to the whole population of the Kingdom of Cambodia.”\nKenji Ono, Managing Director, AEON (CAMBODIA) Co., Ltd, said, “We renewed our sales floor plans with the reinforcement for bedding, furniture, travel goods, fashion accessories and Japanese food. As the result, we achieved 120 per cent increase at the average of total sales from January to June. We have very good response and support from many customers. We will continue to deliver the brand new food and products for the Cambodian people, by utilizing our global procurement network.”\nThe second AEON mall is planned in the north of the central Phnom Penh, where the new “Pong Peay City” project is already developed, as well as new residential estates are currently under construction.\nIt is a very convenient access from both the downtown of Phnom Penh and the surrounding areas.\nThe area is expected to see further development in future.\nYajima, said, “The second mall will be targeting the new young generations, the consumer group which is expected to be expanding. We will provide the tenant mix structure that will realize all-new shopping experience to the visitors, where people can enjoy the time of excitement.”\nCambodia’s growing GDP will help the retail industry to get a boost.
