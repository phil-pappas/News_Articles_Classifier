That came on Scherzer's 105th pitch, and fans at the stadium rose to salute the right-hander with a standing ovation. To that point, the Reds only had three baserunners, on walks in the first, third and seventh innings.\nBarnhart wound up scoring on Skip Schumaker's single, the only other hit allowed by Scherzer (13-12), who left after the eighth.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T01:57:03.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
