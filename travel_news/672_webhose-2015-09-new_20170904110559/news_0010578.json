There were 230 passengers on board the flight.\nAccording to the statements of the airline, the plane had to make an unscheduled landing due to broken lavatories while flying the route of the ill-fated MH-17. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-19 is the new code of the airliner’s route to Amsterdam.\nLast year in July, in one of the most tragic airline disasters, the flight MH-17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing all the 298 people on board.\nThe emergency landing was carried out safely and the plane later headed to Kuala Lumpur after the technical issue was addressed. The incident took place just two days after the airline announced a new holding company, Malaysia Airlines Berhad – as a part of the new marketing strategy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:12:10.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
