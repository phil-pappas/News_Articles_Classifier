The contract for the annual £1.2 million spend includes all aspects of live event management, delegate experience and logistics. Capita Travel and Events has managed the contract since 2012 when it was awarded to Venues Event Management, the event specialist that became part of Capita Travel and Events in the same year after it was acquired by Capita plc. \nRoger Peters, senior purchasing manager, Capgemini said: “Our meetings and events activity is an investment in our business’ future. To achieve our event objectives and best value, partnering with the right agency is essential. Capita Travel and Events gives us the stability, security and support structure of a plc with the relationships, creativity and flexibility of a small event agency.” Kay Weatherley, UK marketing events manager, Capgemini added: “The role of marketing and events is evolving and for creativity to flourish our agency relationships must remain dynamic too. Capita Travel and Events understand that and they are evolving with our needs.” Paul Stoddart, director of meetings and events, Capita Travel and Events, said: “We’re known for bringing value to meetings and events but being known for turning great ideas into immersive experiences is just as important for our growth. We’re delighted that Capgemini trusts us to do both and are privileged to be their continued partner of choice.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T18:03:16.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
