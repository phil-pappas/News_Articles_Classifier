A story of revenge and dark secrets, decaying houses and an isolated protagonist (Connie Gifford), it is inspired by landscape – the landscape of the Fishbourne Marshes as a storm is about to hit – and also by my own childhood obsession with a strange and decaying museum of taxidermy in a neighbouring town. I grew up in Fishbourne, a small village in West Sussex, in the Sixties and Seventies. To the east, the spire of Chichester Cathedral dominates the landscape. To the west are the sailing villages of Bosham and Chidham and, farther on, the great naval and maritime cities of Portsmouth and Southampton. To the north lie the folds of the Downs, the remains of an Iron Age fort on the Trundle and the endless Sussex sky. • Where to stay in West Sussex To the south is the sea. Not the yellow sands of the Witterings or Bognor Regis, but the muddy, tidal estuary of Fishbourne Marshes. Cross the main road by the Bull’s Head, go down Mill Lane past “Pendrills”, with its thatched roof, to the duck pond, where many generations of wellington boots came to the same muddy end. Salt Mill House sat – and sits still – on the edge of the estuary, looking out over the silent expanse of water like a sentinel to the Fishbourne Marshes. Out in the centre of the Channel, the ruins of Farhill’s Mill were visible at each low tide. Low tide at Chichester Harbour Photo: Alamy I loved the hushed stillness of the reed mace that towered over my head, the rills and streams that wound round and round, invisible in the reeds, and the way the sou’westerly made the stalks rattle like bones. When we were children, my sisters and I stopped on the middle of the three bridges to drop Pooh sticks, before continuing on to the open fields and sea ahead. We played Swallows and Amazons (without the boat) and Narnia (without the snow). We trekked along the old flint sea wall to Oak Pond, where an old rowing boat lay scuttled in the silted water. I remember the chill autumn days, the air heavy with the smell of bonfires and dusk, damp mulch of leaves underfoot. Sharp winter afternoons, the sky lowering purple and grey above the Sussex Downs towards Goodwood and East Dean. Gulls shrieking out at sea, and the hawthorn and blackthorn bushes stark and bare. Later, pinpricks of spring as the first wildflowers showed their colours in blossoms of yellow and pink. This was the real and imagined landscape of my childhood, both specific and timeless. • Kate Mosse’s Travelling Life Looking back now, in my mid-50s, I can see that the roots of becoming a writer – the combination of landscape and history and storytelling – lie in that Sussex childhood, in that specific place and at that particular time. When I was growing up, Fishbourne was still an old-fashioned village, even though the discovery in 1960 of a jewel of a Roman Palace had brought archaeologists from all over the world. Built in AD75, destroyed by fire in the late third century, Fishbourne Roman Palace is one of the largest private houses ever discovered, has the most extensive collection of mosaics in situ in Britain (including “The Boy on the Dolphin”) and impressive formal Roman gardens. A plain, flint-faced 13th-century church , with 14th-century tiles on the altar step, triple lancets and Purbeck shafts, sat in the fields to the east of the village. On the outer walls were scratched crosses where medieval pilgrims, making their way to the Shrine of St Richard of Chichester, had left their antique marks. Surrounding the village were pathways and lanes overgrown with cow parsley in summer. A quiet, modest corner of England, with three pubs, a village shop, a Methodist chapel and a post office. Fishbourne Roman Palace Photo: Alamy Even after I had left home and my parents had moved away, my memories of Fishbourne remained strong. Our images of the past are often fragile. Things are not so big, not so perfect as our imagination paints them. So when, in the late Nineties, I moved back to Sussex (now with a family of my own), I was nervous about going to Fishbourne for fear it would not be as I remembered. On a damp November day, the air heavy with the smell of bonfires and dusk, finally I took a deep breath and went. I wandered up the road in the semi-light to look at the house we had lived in as children. There was a light on in the kitchen and on the half landing halfway up the stairs. Smaller? Certainly. It looked well cared for. Families had come and gone. The house, too, had lived its life. Later, hands cold and coat zipped to the chin, I went across to the Marshes before the light slipped from the sky. Farming had encroached on the untended woodlands, the paths were less haphazard and white posts marked the way across the estuary at low tide. But the feeling of freedom and space were still the same. The gulls shrieking, the leaves underfoot, the hawthorn bushes – the emotional landscape was unchanged. • Britain's 10 best cities By now, I was a full-time writer. The world of my imagination, though, was not Sussex but rather the south west of France: Tarascon-sur-Ariège, Toulouse, Collioure, Couiza, Rennes-les-Bains and, most of all, Carcassonne. Arriving there in 1989 as a chance visitor, it was in Languedoc that I had learnt how to write. In Sussex, I had too many memories – real experiences – rooting me to the place to allow me to slip out from underneath them. The years passed: 2010, 2011, 2012. After decades researching, planning, writing about Carcassonne – in Labyrinth, Sepulchre, Citadel and The Winter Ghosts – I had also turned my hand to non-fiction, to plays, to short stories. In a ghost story called The Revenant, I attempted to put Fishbourne on the page for the first time. And it worked. I realised I was, at last, ready to write properly about home. Not my adopted home of Carcassonne, but home home. Sussex home. A cottage in the village of Bosham Photo: Alamy • The best places and cities to visit in England Now, when I visited Fishbourne, I took a notebook. I sketched and jotted and researched. I noticed that although one of the pubs had gone, the other two were still there. The old antiques shop on the main road had vanished, but a wonderful restaurant, the Greenhouse, had taken its place. The Roman Palace continued to draw visitors from all over the world. The church still looked quietly, peacefully, out over the waters of the estuary. The old Victorian laundry – Dhobi – at the foot of Salthill Road, was still there to see, next to the white-timbered Dame School. The cottage on the main road where T S Eliot had spent a few dismal months in the early Twenties was unchanged. The railway halt still looked much as it had when it opened in 1909. At the turn of the last century, there had been two shops servicing the village – Blakes of Old Fishbourne and Nutbeams of New Fishbourne. They were both now gone, but the sweet shop on “The Bend” of the main road, just past the Post Office and the Methodist Chapel, was still there. I sought out old maps of the village in the County Record Office to trace the outline of the flour mill, the salt mill and the water mill. Little by little, the idea for The Taxidermist’s Daughter took shape. A Gothic thriller of revenge and dark secrets, set against the backdrop of a decaying, odd house, where the remnants of Connie Gifford’s father’s museum of taxidermy are stored. I found myself imagining – superimposing on top of the Fishbourne of my childhood, of the Fishbourne I walked now – a third version of the place. An imagined setting, where my lead character, Connie, lived in her isolated home, Blackthorn House, at the head of Fishbourne Creek, surrounded by the remains of her father’s once-celebrated museum of bird taxidermy. I added Slay Cottage, next to Pendrills, at the bottom of Mill Lane and, on the far side of the creek, towards Dell Quay, another sinister house hidden in the Apuldram woods. • Top 10 British weekend breaks I’ve just begun research for a new trilogy of historical novels, none of which is set in Sussex. But I still walk on the Fishbourne Marshes once or twice a week. It’s a different place each time I go, depending on the time of day and the season, the weather and the height of the tide. Because fresh water flows into the saltwater channel here, the estuary is home to some of the most varied waterfowl in the UK. The occasional kingfisher at the freshwater sluices or hundreds of pairs of mute swans turning the surface of the sea white in nesting season. In the reed banks, among the lyme grass and Spartina, are waders, dunlin, grey plover and ring plover, black-tailed godwit, redshank, teal and goldeneye duck. Head along the western sea wall, to see Brent geese and curlews in the oak pond, herons and little egrets. And, if you’re lucky, a glimpse of the rare blooms of “the Spiked Star of Bethlehem” and purple sea lavender. Feathers and colour and light. This is how a story takes flight.
