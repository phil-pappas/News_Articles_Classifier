So this winter, the tour operator is introducing the new Kidcations magazine to help and inspire families when they are planning their next trip away.\nWithin its pages, Moms, Dads, grandparents and kids looking for their perfect holiday together will only find resorts that meet all the tour operator’s criteria for a truly memorable family vacation, from varied accommodation options and menus for tots to pristine beachfronts and supervised children’s activities. Also included are recommendations on excursions and attractions designed with younger ones in mind; plus travelling tips, advice on the best kids clubs and activities, together with reviews of the latest gear and gadgets to ensure family travel is a breeze.\nHowever choosing the next kidcation isn’t just a decision for the grown-ups to make. This summer, the tour operator has conducted a national search for some junior kidcation reviewers – or more simply, ‘kidcationers’. Over the next few months, the handpicked group of children and teenagers will be touring some of Sunwing’s most popular Family Collection™ resorts and sharing their impressions first hand, which will be published in the magazine’s next edition in early 2016.\nThe first edition of Sunwing’s Kidcations magazine is now available for download at Sunwing.ca, and can also be obtained at travel agencies across the country. A copy will also be inserted in the December edition of the popular family magazine, Today’s Parent.\nSource:- Sunwing Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:44:54.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
