Receipts once peaked at $12.5 billion.\nTourism is a major source of hard currency in Egypt, where foreign reserves have tumbled from $36 billion before the uprising to $18 billion at the end of August.\nZaazou is hopeful that the tourism sector will pick up next year with double digit growth in the number of tourists and revenues ranging between $9-10 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:10:55.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
