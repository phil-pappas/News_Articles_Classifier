But instead of looking like the cool couples in the brochures you look like Crumplestiltskin from air travel or a pre-cruise land journey.\nHere are some packing and laundry tips to turn you from crushed and crumpled to smooth and sophisticated as you embark on your cruise adventure.\nSpace. As well as man’s final frontier there is quite a bit of clothes storage space in most cabins, though you may have to double hang some items due few coathangers. That means you can pack more than you might if you were packing and unpacking every day and hauling luggage on planes, trains and cars.\nOther Stories Shot by police to prevent rampage News 0 comments Sales’ cutting question for PM Television How Hayne left Aussie businessman devastated More Sports 0 comments How Duran Duran got their groove back Entertainment 0 comments Why being an escort has made me a better mother Rendezview 0 comments ‘Safety is my middle name’ Nsw 0 comments Suitcases go under the bed, check carefully for draws for undies, T-shirts etc as there may be more than you initially think. Bathrooms can be a bit miserly for bench space so some cosmetics may have to live in a draw. Leave non-essential items in suitcases, eg that rain jacket you may not need. Cabins usually have a safe — use it, but don’t forget to take your wallet on shore excursions, as it is easy to get used to a ship’s cashless card system for purchases.\nBe prepared for all occasions. Picture: Supplied Roll or fold. Matter of personal choice but I prefer careful folding to minimise creases, and wear or fold a suit jacket across the top of the suitcase as the last item. Cram shoes with electrical adaptors and chargers as well as socks and sundries which also keep shoes in shape. Pack them in a plastic bag to avoid dirt rubbing off. Google ‘how to pack a suitcase’ for videos and tips on efficient packing. It is amazing how much you can cram in — and if you only unpack once, rather than every night at a different hotel, it is worth the effort.\nI ron-ick! For safety reasons cabins don’t have irons. You can use the laundry — a drag when you are on holidays — or pay to send it out. I usually hang shirts in the bathroom and let the steam from a hot shower work its magic on creases. My wife tells me non-crease wear that can mix and match, teamed with different scarfs, or various coloured shirts under the same dark jacket, gives ladies a variety of outfits. Loyalty programs for repeat customers often include free laundry when you reach a certain level.\nAdapt yourself. Check carefully beforehand what power points your ship uses, and take an adaptor to suit so you can recharge your phone, tablet, camera and other electrical paraphernalia. Some ships carry spare adaptors if you forget but don’t rely on it.\nWither the weather. Even in warmer climates nights at sea on deck can be a bit cool. Check the weather where you are headed and pack accordingly, erring to cover unexpectedly cold weather. Layer upon layer are best in the cold, eg thermal T-shirt, fleece, windproof jacket, so you can strip down if it gets hot on a shore excursion. A light spray jacket that crams in a handbag is handy. If flying from an Aussie summer to a European winter to meet a ship a warm jacket on hand when landing is a must. Take swimmers for an Alaskan cruise — hanging in a hot tub on deck while a massive glacier calves an iceberg under a clear blue sky is sublime.\nGo from casual to smart with these tips. Formal night. Cruise ships have evening dress codes which vary between lines, but generally run from ‘casual’ to ‘smart casual’ to ‘formal’. The latter can be a hassle for men as it means packing good shoes, a dark suit or a tuxedo on top of your jeans, shorts and swimmers, while women need a glamour dress or two. Some people skip such nights and just eat at the buffet, but you will feel out of place in a track suit if the rest of the passengers are dolled up. Some lines such as Cunard are more strict about formal nights to add an air of elegance to a cruise. Some lines hire formal wear.\nPants are not optional. Cruise lines give a good guide to what to pack on their websites, but generally by day it is casual wear such as shorts, T-shirts or polo shirts and footwear, most evenings it is gear you would wear to a nice restaurant or if you were in a up-market land-based resort. Swimwear is not acceptable in dining areas, nor is bare feet. And gentlemen, I implore you — if you are a young athlete then Speedos by the pool are fine, but there comes a time when revealing budgie smugglers (and string bikinis) should be confined to the privacy of your backyard pool. Rotund ageing Europeans relentlessly baking themselves brown while SunSmart Aussies seek out shade by the pool are yet to discover this law of nature.\nDown and dirty. Keep a draw for dirty clothes, or put them in your suitcase under the bed to keep your room relatively tidy. It also will help you keep track of how much clean gear you have left. Ships sell T-shirts if you run low but you’ll have to manage your socks and jocks supply. And of course clothes bought in a port make great keepsakes. If you need extra luggage to carry such purchases, luggage shops have sturdy expandable bags that down to purse-size which are handy to throw in your suitcase.\nGet lei-ed. Check if your cruise has a themed night. In warmer climates some will have a tropical deck party night where you can break out that Magnum PI Hawaiian shirt or sarong and get into the spirit of things as a band belts out dance tunes.\nZip it! Zip it good! Large zip-lock plastic bags come in handy for all sorts of things, but especially for damp swimmers after your last afternoon around the pool when you have to pack that evening and have your suitcase outside the cabin door that night for disembarkation. Plan your clothes for that last night too — you will need an outfit for the evening, then will have to squeeze those clothes into a carry-on bag when you go to bed if your main suitcase has been taken, plus have an outfit ready to wear off the ship and to any connecting transport.\nOriginally published as How to pack for a cruise holiday", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2ad9708549886017f198bcd2f3e3ecf0", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/df0da8f9a21f8e4ad064e3fe7cddc065", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/travel/holiday-ideas/how-to-pack-for-a-cruise-holiday/story-fnjjv4qv-1227517291283?sv=22228814082c20a72552800f58de970e", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b3c93a3cca0601d5ab5abb6b5f39e803?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e1ee267f02fce88ba297faf32283a638", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/eae091e7ed12217b525ec9e7fbaf07f3?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd6495223d9a3c63ad714d8a3630e6a4", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/07503218fc4604974d126e8f3bc7d0aa", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&maxRelated=6&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-04T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:37:55.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
