This service represents the first time that Staten Islanders have had a mass transit connection directly to Newark Airport. The new service, the TAZ 100, provides 14 round trips per day from the following three points on Staten Island :\nRoute 100 Bus Stop\nMass transit connections\nHuguenot SIR Station\nStaten Island Railway, X17, X19, X23, X24\nOuterbridge Park & Ride\nX17, X22\nWest Shore Expressway â€“ Victory Boulevard\nS62, S92, X11, X19, X22\nFree parking is also available at the Outerbridge Park & Ride, conveniently located at the south end of the Korean War Veterans Parkway and the West Shore Expressway.\nThe Route 100 service fills a critical need for Staten Island residents. The Port Authority's annual profile of departing passengers indicates that 1.4% of Newark Airport users originate in Staten Island , representing a market size of almost 500,000 passengers per year. A larger number of Staten Islanders used both LGA (1.9%) and JFK (1.5%) than Newark in 2014. It is likely that with this new service, Newark will become the airport of choice for Staten Island .\nFares on Route 100 are $20 each way and reservations are required. Airport employees can buy a 10 trip ticket for just $50 . Children 12 and under as well as seniors over the age of 65 are just $10 each way. This is a significant discount over the cab and shuttle fares currently charged in this market. All fares are payable in cash aboard the vehicle.\nFor more information on the new Staten Island-Newark Airport bus service, please visit our website at http://www.ewrbus.com .
