Thats what it felt like from the minute we left our car in the lower deck of the Nova Star, an overnight ferry from Portland, Maine, to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. People with luggage  not everyone boards with a car  were waiting for the elevator, but as we had packed separate overnight bags, we took the stairs to the main deck. A crew member immediately directed us to our cabin, where our cabin steward was waiting for us. Patrick showed us how things worked, stowed our packs, asked if we needed outlet converters, fetched extra towels and showed Mary how to fold down her bed, which was in day position as a comfortable sofa. The cabin, an owners suite, was at the bow of the ship, with large round windows on two sides. The wall behind the queen-sized bed slanted inward, so as we fell asleep in the middle of the Gulf of Maine later than night, we could look straight up at a star-filled sky. The cabin was the size of a small hotel room, with plenty of space for the three of us. Along with the bed and the sofa/bunk, another upper berth could be folded down for sleeping. There was closet space, a large-screen tv, a desk/vanity and chair. The forward-facing window had a window seat which could have doubled as a luggage stand. The décor was smooth, stylish and functional, The feeling of being on a cruise extended beyond our luxurious cabin. The décor of the ferry is smart and modern, with plenty of public spaces. The Sea Glass Lounge offers comfortable seating and sea views through huge glass windows. Drinks are served here and in Pipers Pub, where theres a light menu of burgers and sandwiches. For a full dinner, we had two choices. We could have chosen Currents, with crisp linens, well-spaced tables and a fine-dining menu that specializes in fresh seafood from the Gulf of Maine and products from local producers (including an excellent regional cheese board). We chose the more informal Fathoms Buffet, where we were presented a wide choice of entrees and side dishes. We helped ourselves to fresh-made salads and appetizers (my shrimp salad was delicately seasoned, high on shrimp and low on fillers), and had options of fresh fish, fried or baked chicken, curry and several appetizing vegetarian dishes. Staff was there to answer questions about ingredients and to serve the carved-to-order roast beef. When I started toward the dining room with my tray, a staff member stepped up and offered to carry it as he showed us to a table beside the window. Throughout dinner he continued to be attentive, clearing empty plates, offering to refill drinks, urging us to return for seconds and dessert. After dinner we browsed in Novatique, the large shop filled with quality Maine and Nova Scotia products, then borrowed a couple of games from the ships selection and retired to our cabin. Breakfast was early the next morning (the ferry pulls into Yarmouth at 7am), but again we had plenty of choices of egg dishes, fish, pancakes, waffles, a full array of breakfast meats and pastries. The corned beef hash was delicious and my eggs cooked right. I rejoiced to see the premium brand of tea I was served. Debarkation was a fast and smooth as our embarkation in Portland had been, and we were quickly on our way into the wooded interior of Nova Scotia, for a stay at Trout Point Lodge , a five-star wilderness resort. While I had been lucky enough to receive a gift certificate for the round trip on the ferry, we enjoyed our mini-cruise so much that we are planning a return trip on the Nova Star to see Nova Scotias Acadian Coast painted in fall foliage.
