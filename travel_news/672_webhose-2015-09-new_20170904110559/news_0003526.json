Hotel safe \nSo what should you do? “If you have valuables, check to see if these are available or if they have other options. Beyond that, keeping your valuables on you when you leave your room is your next best option.” \nMcGoey offers the following tips to travellers who wish to protect their valuables while on the road. \n• Think of hotel safes as being minimally secure, a step above hiding valuables in luggage or hidden in a drawer. \n• Hotel safes that are not secured to the wall are not very secure. \n• Hotel safes should not be used for things of great value, importance, or one-of-a-kind items. \n• Ask the concierge about secure safe. Hotels usually have one in their offices. \nThis story originally appeared on Fox News .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:34:52.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
