Choosing the right flights for your cruise can be stressful, however, even for experienced cruisers. While some travelers are only concerned about flights during the winter months, careful planning is needed no matter what time of the year your cruise vacation takes place. Flight connections can be critical for cruise vacations. Many itineraries include one or two days at sea at the outset of the cruise. Delayed passengers may miss the ship, losing these relaxing days at sea. They also must to fly to the ships first port of call to pick up their cruise, incurring substantial expenses. Here are seven flight planning tips that will help get you to your cruise on time. 1. Arrive a day early. This is good advice for any time of the year, not just during the winter months. Arriving a day early provides cushion time to guard against any weather or mechanical problems that could interfere with your flight. It involves the additional expense of a hotel room, but the peace of mind early arrival brings is often well worth the cost. In addition, early arrival allows time for exploring your embarkation port or nearby locales. To save on hotel rooms, consider booking your stay using Priceline or Hotwire. This works well for singles or couples, but families should be careful. Double beds and occupancy levels above two persons per room are not guaranteed. Determining what price to bid might seem tricky - use BiddingforTravel.com, BetterBidding.com and BiddingTraveler.com to discover what Priceline or Hotwire bids have been accepted recently. Additional sites that can be helpful in finding hotel bargains include Trivago.com and GetaRoom.com. Call GetaRoom.coms 800-number to uncover low unadvertised specials. 2. Weigh the benefits of cruise line-provided flights. Vacationers often purchase cruise packages that include round-trip flights. The notion is that cruise lines can access bulk airline fares, often saving hundreds of dollars per air ticket. Some cruise lines also offer special deals, such as free air or 2-for-1 flights, which are particularly attractive. Before purchasing these packages, check to see what your airfare costs would be if you purchased your tickets independently. Also ask to see if you will have the right to request alternative flights if you dont like the options the cruise line provides. 3. Take a direct flight or leave plenty of time for connections. Direct flights can be more expensive, but thats not always the case. Use a good travel agent or book your flights immediately after you purchase your cruise for the best results. If connecting flights are mandatory for your cruise, make sure to allow plenty of time for connections. While a 40-50 minute connecting time between flights is often considered to be legal by the airlines, it will give you little cushion if theres a weather or mechanical delay. If youre flying to your embarkation port on the same day your cruise departs, its important to play it safe and allow 90 minutes or more for connections. 4. Check flight on-time arrival statistics before purchasing. Some flights are almost always on time, while others have a history of significant delays. Before booking your flights, check out each of your options arrival statistics using FlightStats.com and book accordingly. Some airlines and online booking engines also provide flight statistics on their websites, so take a look there as well. 5. Purchase trip insurance. Consider purchasing trip insurance to protect your vacation investment in case of an unforeseen transportation problem, family illness, or other issue. When buying your insurance, its important to make sure that your flights are wrapped into the coverage. Some vacationers buy insurance directly from their cruise line when purchasing their cruise and then obtain their own flights separately. When a problem arises with their flights, they can find that their trip insurance only covers the cruise. Make sure you understand what is covered by the trip insurance policy youre purchasing and read the fine print carefully. If you have trip insurance and a problem arises, your provider's concierge staff can help you make alternative travel arrangements. 6. Monitor the weather continually. Sometimes weather can cause even the most carefully arranged plans to go awry. As your departure date draws closer, monitor weather conditions carefully. If it appears that a storm may affect your travel plans, check with your airline to find out what options are available. These may include departing a day early if not doing so already or leaving on an earlier flight. 7. Be proactive. Set up airline notifications about your flight's status via phone, email or text. In addition, monitor the situation carefully once you arrive at the airport. If it appears that you may run into a problem, do not wait for the airlines to contact you to rebook. By that time, many of the best flight options may already be gone. Take charge of your situation. If your flight is not canceled, the airlines may not contact you at all. It is your responsibility to decide whats best for your specific circumstances and take the appropriate steps to arrive at your cruise vacation on time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T08:00:05.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
