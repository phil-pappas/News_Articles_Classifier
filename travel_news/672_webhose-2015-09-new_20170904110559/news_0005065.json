DAV's MSO will be available at two Gateway Tire locations this week – in Gallatin, Tenn. on Sept. 24 , and in Clarksville, Tenn. on Sept 25 .\nAs part of Hankook's commitment to helping people through mobility, Hankook continues to support DAV's efforts to reach underserved veterans. DAV makes 70 stops within the southeast region each year to provide free services, including Tennessee , where Hankook will open its first U.S. manufacturing plant in 2016. At the MSO stops, certified DAV National Service Officers will be available in the \"office on wheels\" to ensure veterans who sacrificed for the nation receive the benefits they earned.\nGateway Tire also will host special activities during the times of the MSO stops. Details on the two MSO stops are listed below:\nGateway Tire – Gallatin\nThursday, Sept. 24, 2015\n9:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. CDT\n380 Hancock Street\nGallatin, TN 37066\nGateway Tire – Clarksville\nFriday, Sept. 25, 2015\n9:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. CDT\n2600 Highway 41A Bypass\nClarksville, TN 37043\n\"Hankook is proud to partner with DAV's MSO program and utilize mobility to ensure veterans receive the valuable services they need right in their hometowns,\" said Henry Kopacz , Public Relations and Social Media Manager, Hankook Tire America Corp. \"The support of local Hankook dealers like Gateway Tire Gallatin and Gateway Tire Clarksville to host these stops is appreciated as we strive to provide the local veteran community access to these services.\"\nThe purpose of the DAV program is to help veterans living in smaller town and rural communities obtain the Veterans Affairs and other benefits and services they need to lead high quality lives. Last year, DAV's Mobile Service Offices traveled more than 100,000 miles to 922 cities to help veterans and their families.\n\"We're very excited to continue to have such a valuable partner like Hankook on board with DAV's mission of service to America's veterans and their families,\" said DAV National Adjutant and CEO J. Marc Burgess . \"They're directly contributing to enhancing the lives of those who had the courage to say 'send me' when our country called. Giving back to the veteran community speaks volumes about the people who comprise their great organization.\"\nAbout DAV\nDAV empowers veterans to lead high-quality lives with respect and dignity. It is dedicated to a single purpose: fulfilling our promises to the men and women who served. DAV does this by ensuring that veterans and their families can access the full range of benefits available to them; providing employment resources to veterans and their spouses; fighting for the interests of America's injured heroes on Capitol Hill; and educating the public about the great sacrifices and needs of veterans transitioning back to civilian life. DAV, a non-profit organization with nearly 1.3 million members, was founded in 1920 and chartered by the U. S. Congress in 1932.
