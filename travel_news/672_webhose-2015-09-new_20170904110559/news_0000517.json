The content, which Moravia's travel specialists create from start to finish, satisfies the skyrocketing need global travel and hospitality companies have to drive online engagement and bookings worldwide.\nAccording to the World Bank, more than 1.5 billion people travel internationally each year. More than 57 percent of international travelers now book their reservations on the internet, the Statistic Brain Research Institute also says.\nThe surge in online reservations is fueling the global travel industry's demand for what Moravia Chief Marketing Officer, Renato Beninatto , calls \"hyper-localization in real time.\"\n\"Sometimes using pre-written content isn't enough to deliver the level of precision travel companies need to drive online conversions and sales, no matter how accurate the translation itself is,\" Beninatto said. \"Because of different holidays, currencies, religious customs and other cultural distinctions-not to mention special promotions in local markets-completely new content is often mandatory.\n\"Moravia has fixed the problem by providing travel companies with customized content that speaks directly to targeted business and leisure travelers on a global scale. It's a major step forward for Moravia, and a value-added service we plan to continue to expand in the future.\"\nBeninatto also said Moravia's growth in the travel segment plays a pivotal role in the company's expansion strategy.\n\"We now have a team of about 150 people who focus on the travel segment specifically,\" he said. \"Since online bookings and reservations are becoming the norm pretty much everywhere in the world, we see the hospitality segment as one of our primary catalysts for growth.\"\nAbout Moravia\nMoravia is a leading globalization solution provider, enabling companies in the information technology, e-learning, life sciences and hospitality industries to enter global markets with high-quality multilingual products.
