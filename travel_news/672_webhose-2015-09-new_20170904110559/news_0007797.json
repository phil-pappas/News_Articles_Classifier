The ‘Loub’ job is named after famed shoe designer Christian Louboutin and in a little amount of time has risen to be a favourite amongst the Hollywood elite who love their heels but don’t want to suffer for them. Also known as the Stiletto Lift, the Loub Job is already ultra-popular, with shoe-lovers everywhere jumping on the bandwagon so they too can wear their favorite stilettos without suffering the trademark pain!\nNormally when you walk, your weight gets evenly distributed over the entire bottom of your feet. But when you slip into your heels, that weight focuses onto the ball of the foot instead of the whole sole. The ball of the foot has a pad of fat that acts as shock absorber between the bone and the shoe. When women wear stilettos, that fat pad gets pushed away, ultimately resulting in bone that no longer has the padding it needs, resulting in corns and calluses. Your four inch Louboutins become torture devices as a result.\nHeard of fillers used to plump the face? Well those same natural fillers are instead used for the feet. The lift involves injecting hyaluronic acid fillers into your soles. Hyaluronic acid is a natural protein in the skin that gives it suppleness and padding.When you inject the filler, you instantly give your feet a natural cushioning, so they don’t have to bear so much pressure on the bones. This soft skin filler acts like an internal pad under the callus.\nOnce you inject this filler into the balls of your feet, you will feel an immediate reduction in discomfort. In the weeks following the injection, the filler will form a sort of lattice over the bone, which acts as a cushion. In the longer term, it stimulates your own body to create collagen, which further increases the cushioning. It can cost around `30,000 per milliliter and the best part is that most injections are good for about three years!\nThe author is a celebrity dermatologist.\n dermatologist lifestyle Christian Louboutin Hollywood Also Read Brits suffer from 3,024 hangovers in lifetime Foods for a flat tummy Angie Harmon splits from Jason Sehorn Oscar winning actor Robin Williams dead at 63", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/22WOMAN-WITH-TIRED-FEET-WITH-HEELS_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/150921/lifestyle-fashionbeauty/article/celebrity-‘loub’-job", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/22WOMAN-WITH-TIRED-FEET-WITH-HEELS_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-22T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:28:47.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
