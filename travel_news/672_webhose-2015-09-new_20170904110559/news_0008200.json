And you’d be right: Even  missouriwine.org  admits only the hardiest of strains can survive in a state that gets everything from scorching hot to frosty cold.\nStill, there are 128 wineries selling $56 million of wine per year, employing 14,959 people and paying $454 million in wages in the state, according to a 2013 report.\nSo, forgive me if I’m surprised, Missouri.\nThere are, within a short drive from our base camp — a luxury two-bedroom cottage on the outskirts of Branson — ten wineries. This was never supposed to be a wine story, so I only visited a couple, but it’s just another indication Missouri seemingly has something for everyone.\nI’m not really a wine guy, so I’ll leave it to the paper’s resident expert as to whether the Norton (Missouri’s state grape) is full-bodied with notes of chalk and tar and a whiff of asparagus on the finish… We had planned to play a lot of golf. The weather had other ideas.\nIn Branson, it rained so hard on a couple of days, I’m sure I looked out and saw a gentleman with a white, flowing beard sitting on a truckload of gopherwood. This in an area — the northern Ozarks — where July is normally so dry residents are afraid to mow their lawns lest a spark from the mower trigger a wildfire.\nOur trip began in Winnipeg, where we headed south down Highway 75 all the way to Kansas City, the southern terminus of Interstate 29. It was here we first put tee to ground, at Adams Pointe Golf Club in Blue Springs, Mo.\nWe saved a fair bit of coin by arranging for a stay-and-play at the neighbouring hotel, where we got a room for four and a foursome of golf for US$185. Details are on the golf course’s website.\nAdams Pointe is a great golf course, with challenging greens and plenty of terrain. Despite the heat, the grass was lush, with nicely trimmed fairways and thick though not punishing roughs.\nAdams Pointe is 20 miles east of Kansas City. Rates range from US$20 twilight to US$52 weekend daytime with cart. It’s 5,794 yards from the white tees. Par is 36 front and back for total of 72.\nWhile we only had one day to play in KC, we did find some other courses we’d go back to given the chance, including Creekmoor and Shirkey golf clubs, both of which get excellent online reviews.\nAs nice as Adams Pointe was, it was just the appetizer. On our third day in Branson — to where we drove after playing Adams Pointe — my son Spencer and I were treated to a golfer’s dream course, Ledgestone Golf Club just north of Branson.\nLedgestone is a mind-blowing combination of challenging tee shots, gorgeous fairways and greens and stunning views from almost every tee.\nLedgestone isn’t cheap, but it’s far from expensive. Our round was US$75 each, including cart. As far as courses this beautiful are concerned, this was a bargain. It’s built into the limestone hills of the northern Ozarks, and stone is a common design feature for many of the holes.\nThe terrain is amazing, especially for a prairie boy, with uphill fairways, banked doglegs and many elevated tees, including one, on a 165-yard par three, that is so high it turns what might be a six-iron for some golfers into little more than a pitching wedge. My nine-iron shot landed on the back fringe.\nOur trip was in early July, and it’s a scorching time to be playing golf. With the unexpected humidity, the humidex must have been mid- to high-40s. Few golfers would want to walk Ledgestone on the best of days: I can’t imagine anyone surviving it in this heat. Consider carts mandatory. Fall would be my preferred season here.\nWe came to Branson for more than golf, and it didn’t disappoint. The show area of Branson is filled with theatres, some of them a bit gaudy, some of them very westernthemed; go-cart tracks, miniature golf and plenty of restaurants. Historic downtown Branson is a good look at how this town looked before the showmania took over.\n \nt’s been unaffected, other than by the booming economy, by the centre’s status as show capital of the Midwest: Wisely, or perhaps simply driven by the need for space, the area’s founders developed the show district a fair bit west of downtown, preserving many of downtown’s historic buildings and its original charm.\nDinner at The Farmhouse downtown is a must: southern home cooking that’s exceptionally affordably priced. The chicken and dumplings were a treat, and cheap at $8.99.\nMcFarlaine’s, back in the show district, was another unexpected bargain, with a delicious pot roast plate for less than $9. You can go to a chain and pay way more than this for the same food you have at home, but then why travel?\nLike many tourist areas, Branson’s show district has its share of crass commercialism. Almost every theatre has its own gift store, and there are people looking to sell you show tickets everywhere. \"Any ticket for today, $10!\" shouted one pitchman, not long after the second-last show of the day began.\nHere’s a hint about Branson: Don’t pay full price. Coupons are available for almost everything you could want, from discounted show tickets to gifts to go-cart rides. Google \"Save on Branson\" or \"Sunny Day Guide\" as a couple of examples.\nYou can, if you don’t mind short timeshare pitches, get into most shows for free. Just for picking up the Save on Branson coupon book, we got a free show.\nOur first show was on the Showboat Branson Belle, which came with dinner. It was a decent show, reminiscent of the kind of show we saw on our cruise a few years back. The talent was good and the mix of music and entertainment designed to appeal to as wide a cross-section of the population as possible. There was some country-pop, some pop and some Beatles and Rat Pack tribute routines. The magician who served as MC put on an excellent selection of illusions.\nThat bit about appealing to all audience members is especially evident when almost every show included a bit of Bible-thumping and a bit of flag-waving. Each show we saw had small bit of faith-based music (and in each it was from only one faith, by the way) and at least one number touting America as the greatest nation on Earth.\nDinner was pretty straightforward: mashed potatoes, a vegetable, a delicious serving of pot roast and an unappealing- to-look-at-but-tasty piece of chicken.\nIt can all be a little bit hokey, so it won’t be for everyone. The need for most shows to include some gospel and some flag-waving is an interesting example of what the show producers see as required elements for their audiences. It was obvious, but not in a proselytizing sort of way.\nThe family focus of entertainment is also apparent in the choices of beverages at most shows: it’s almost as though Branson is in a dry county (it’s not). Pink lemonade and sweet tea on the Branson Belle, pop, coffee and tea at the two other local joints (Farmhouse and McFarlaine’s) and most shows’ concession stands were similarly dry.\nThe availability of wineries and booze at the local Walmart countered the perception of a throwback to Prohibition, however. Other restaurants are licensed, as well.\nOur favourite show was the Acrobats of China, featuring the New Shanghai Circus. This was a thrilling three hours of acrobatic feats performed on bikes, swinging hoops and tall poles, not to mention some amazing contortionism.\nIt’s performed, interestingly enough, at the Yakov Smirnoff Theatre north of Branson. In the Ozarks, inside a Russian theatre, watching a Chinese acrobatic troupe… Only in America.\nInterestingly, there were no gospel and no pro-American routines.\nWe did come here to golf, and on the last day, the skies opened up and it seemed like a great day for another round. We booked a tee time at the Branson Hills Golf Club, which was formerly the Payne Stewart Golf Club. Stewart grew up in Springfield, Mo., just north of here, and for 10 years, the late golfer’s foundation licensed the name to this spectacular course. According to officials at the club, that 10-year license expired last year and attempts to renegotiate were unsuccessful.\nPayne Stewart was one of the world’s top golfers. He died in 1999 somewhere in the sky west of Gainesville, Fla., when his private jet apparently suffered a catastrophic depressurization, killing all on board, and then flew on autopilot for several hours before running out of fuel and crashing in South Dakota.\nI think Branson Hills would be a great golf course, but with all the rain we had, it was playing extremely long. Every fairway shot where the club didn’t perfectly skim the ends of the blades of grass was a chunk shot. One practice swing produced a mud shower that the pro immediately recognized on my white polo in the pro shop. \"Someone hit a chunker,\" he said.\nFairways had very little roll, and the greens were slow. But the design is fabulous, with a fair bit of terrain and fairway landing areas that rewarded accuracy but didn’t overly punish slightly off-target shots.\nBut it, too, was priced for two people at 1.5 times what we had paid for four in Florida, with a total bill of $148. Branson isn’t expensive, as expensive goes, but it’s not the place to play bargain golf.\nWe didn’t exactly push it on the way home. We overnighted in Kansas City, Sioux Falls, S.D. and Fargo, N.D. You could do it in one shot if you had the stamina, but you’d be missing out on a couple of great stops along the way.\nThe first was some authentic Kansas City barbecue at BB’s Lawnside BBQ in south-central KC, just blocks from the Kansas state line. This is what BBQ is supposed to be: low and slow over the glow, with ribs, and pulled pork and brisket smoked for 14 hours. My ribs were so meaty, even with a half slab, I couldn’t finish them. The hickory was so well-infused, I’m sure the bones would taste smoky.\nSandy had a sundae for her meal. It’s not what you think: beans serve as the ice cream, topped with cole slaw, pulled pork and speared with a pickle, all served in a Mason jar. The kitchen also does a number of Louisiana specials, including, of course, jambalaya and another natch, gumbo. You can even order file powder for seasoning.\nOn the Sunday we were there, it was jam night, with local musicians taking the stage. As we were about to leave, one of the performers was doing an awesome job of Janis Joplin’s Bobby McGee.\nSeating is communal with no maître’d: if you can find an empty seat, it’s yours. Set y’self down, order a Turbodog, and make friends with the locals. If you know what a Turbodog actually is, you’ll fit right in. It was the perfect dive.\nkelly.taylor@freepress.mb.ca \nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T21:25:57.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
