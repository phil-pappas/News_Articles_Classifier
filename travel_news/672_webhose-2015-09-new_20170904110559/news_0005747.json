The successful business comprises the founders and just three part-time workers, a fact which belies its fast growth. Founders Louise Disley and Tom Muir have a baby daughter to look after and Mr Muir still works the odd night shift to cover bills. Production days begin at 2am and, although days begin a little later for the rest of the week when juices aren’t being pressed, Ms Disley and Mr Muir are always up considerably earlier than their baby to get a few hours work in. The business’s part-time sales rep is also a mother of two and works flexible hours from home. Just Juices is long on hours and short on staff, so it needs to be agile and elastic to cope with the demands of the market. But two years in and with several successes already under its belt the business needs to continue growing while maintaining its hard-won fluidity. Flexible working patterns only work well if everyone in the team understands their roles and the targets they must hit So Ms Disley and Mr Muir met with serial entrepreneur and mentor Sahar Hashemi in London to hear her tips on retaining the flexibility of a start-up as the business gets bigger. “When your business grows, it is very tempting to start creating structures and processes to handle the extra admin, and this can create a bureaucratic environment,” says Ms Sahar. “It’s important at this stage to remember what made you successful in the first place.” “The good news is that simple technology can help businesses work smarter without everyone having to convene in one place. Many of these tools didn’t exist a few years ago, so today is a good time to start a business.” An example of this technology is Canon’s Wi-Fi-equipped MAXIFY range of printers, which allow users to print samples, marketing materials and designs remotely via an app. Ms Disley is keen to follow that advice: “We want to keep the agile start-up model. Anyone we bring into the company will have to love the product and be passionate about the business. We want to be a fun, young company, no matter how old we get.” To keep things fluid, the business uses cloud software (Google Docs) which allows anyone in the business to access and update documents in real time. It saves on email hassle and removes the risk of mistakes from working with outdated files.

The production staff work one day a week, starting at 2am on Monday morning, to get the juices pressed and sent to a facility for high-pressure processing, which kills bacteria and means the product stays fresher for longer. But flexible working patterns such as these only work well if everyone in the team understands their roles and the targets they must hit, according to Ms Sahar. “It’s really important we all understand our job roles so that there is no overlap,” agrees co-founder Mr Muir. “Being organised means we are efficient, while setting targets and marking performance against them helps everyone understand what needs to be done to get to the next level. “We do KPIs [key performance indicators] for everything, and everything is measured. We leave nothing to chance and as long as we do that, it matters less about constantly monitoring our staff – which would be time-consuming as well as detracting from growing the business.” The structure of Just Juices is bound to change in coming years, and it will be important to retain a commitment to the brand as the business grows, says Ms Sahar. Whether or not Just Juices remains successful depends on the people it takes on, she adds. Recruitment will become a major focus for them in the next 12 months. As the business grows and takes on more employees, Ms Disley and Mr Muir will have to hire strangers based on interviews and CVs. So far, the three part-time employees are all “friends of friends”. “It’s quite a nerve-wracking prospect recruiting people who haven’t been endorsed or recommended by someone we know well,” says Ms Disley, “but it’s a challenge we have to face as the business grows. “Trust will be very important and we will just have to make sure we hire the right people so our commitment to flexible working practices continues.” • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:41:50.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
