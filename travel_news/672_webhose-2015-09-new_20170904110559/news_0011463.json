Teotihuacán is a wonderful place to start your Mayan journey of discovery , as it is culturally the ideal introduction to the Mayan trail. The early history of this Mesoamerican site is still being investigated and therefore it is unclear precisely when their civilisation started, but it is believed to belong to the Mesoamerica Late Classic Era, as the earliest buildings at Teotihuacán date from between the 1st to the 7th century AD. The culture and architecture seem to also be influenced by the Olmec people, who are considered to be the mother civilisation of Mesoamerica. It is one of the formative civilisations ever discovered in Mexico, and it is easy to understand why they named it Teotihuacán, “City of the Gods”. It is located in a very dry and flat area, so the pyramids dominate the landscape as you approach. It is a powerful place, and I found that I was really affected by its commanding majesty. While smaller than Tikal in Guatemala, Palenque contains some of the finest examples of Mayan architecture, stone carving and bas relief There are 243 steps to reach the top, but I would say that it is definitely worth the climb – the views of the entire site from the 75m (246ft)-high summit are exhilarating. The Pyramid of the Moon is smaller but older. Located to one side is the Museum of Teotihuacán, which exhibits murals recovered over the course of a century of archaeological excavation. The offerings of jewellery, jade, obsidian, shells and pottery were an important feature of this civilisation. Around the site you will find local craftspeople selling souvenirs made from locally mined semi-precious stones and minerals. You will find information about the fascinating local spiny cactus, the world-renowned agave, which is used in all sorts of products – not least tequila. If plants are your passion, you will love the fabulous botanical garden, which is dedicated to preserving some 60 per cent of Mexico’s endemic flora. Palenque Set in a completely different environment is Palenque, the 8th-century Mayan city that vanished into the jungle of Chiapas for more than 1,000 years. It is estimated that more than 90 per cent of the city is still hidden by jungle. While smaller than Tikal in Guatemala, Palenque contains some of the finest examples of Mayan architecture, stone carving and bas relief. Mayan marvel: the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque It is always hard to decide, but I think I would have to describe Palenque as my favorite Mayan site because of its location in the heart of the Mexican rainforest; the might of the giant Temple of Inscriptions (which rises up in eight levels); and the Tomb of the Red Queen, an enigmatic burial chamber, discovered in 1994, for a mysterious woman whose identity has never been discovered. Any lover of history, and in particular Latin American history, will be fascinated by these sites – and they also appeal to anyone interested in astronomy, as the Mayan and other Mesoamerican civilisations designed their ceremonial buildings according to the location of the Sun, the planets and the constellations. Chichén Itzá A great example of this can be observed at Chichén Itzá, the main Mayan city of the Yucatán Peninsula. People still gather there each year during the vernal and autumnal equinoxes to observe the Sun gradually illuminating the pyramid stairs and the serpent head at its base, creating the image of a snake slithering down the sacred mountain to Earth. This pyramid is dedicated to Quetzalcoatl, the Feather Serpent god. With all this fascinating history, you cannot help but be mesmerised by the mysteries of Central America – even after spending 14 years in this part of the world, I am still intrigued.
