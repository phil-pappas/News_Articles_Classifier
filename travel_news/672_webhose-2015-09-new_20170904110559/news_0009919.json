Saving up enough money, getting the finances together, and filling in the details for a mortgage application are mere impressions on an imaginary canvas. But not for the older generation. Photo: Alamy Although the baby boomers own fewer houses than mainstream thought would have you believe, new research has found that the prospect of buying additional properties is top of the list for the over 55s. According to a new survey conducted by Prudential, nearly two in five home owners aged over 55 are planning to buy at least one more property during their lifetime. Almost one fifth of those planning to buy again will not be using it as their main home, the survey also shows. This suggests a trend towards buy-to-let investments , but also points to the popularity of holiday homes , and the investment of property for a member of the family. Whether that investment is for an older member of the family, retiring into a smaller space , or a child – perhaps a member of Generation Rent – the over 55s are feeling generous.

It isn’t just growing older and potentially having more time that has lead to this increase in older homeowners stretching their portfolio wings. One in seven of the over 55s surveyed said that their plans had come about as a result of the pension freedoms that were launched in April . These have given those eligible more flexibility over how they access their pension savings, and have clearly inspired some to make a move in real estate. Photo: Bloomberg Prudential’s survey also found that the most popular reason given for wanting to buy another property was to downsize , with 43 per cent of people citing this has motivation. “The process of withdrawing cash from a pension fund to purchase property and potentially generate an income is complex and could result in a large tax bill,” commented Stan Russell, a retirement expert at Prudential. \"Anyone aged 50 or over with a defined contribution pension is entitled to free and impartial guidance from the Government's Pension Wise service, and many of those considering accessing their retirement savings under the new freedoms would benefit from a consultation with a financial adviser.\" Are you looking to broaden your property portfolio?
