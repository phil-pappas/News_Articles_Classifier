It would be irresponsible to turn our backs on the suffering of our fellow human beings. As a collective global community, we must do all that we can to try and facilitate a lasting peace.\" -- Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger, in a statement which announced that he would like to see the number of refugees coming to Manitoba double to 3,000 to address the Syrian crisis. Do we have your attention now? Yazidi Kurdish women chant slogans during a protest against the Islamic State group's invasion on Sinjar city, in Dohuk, northern Iraq, Monday, Aug. 3, 2015. Thousands of Yazidi Kurdish women and girls have been sold into sexual slavery and forced to marry Islamic State militants, according to Human Rights organizations, Yazidi activists and observers. The crisis in Syria: The world is wide awake now to the plight of refugees as the Middle East mires in war. But among them, the Yazidis of Syria and Iraq deserve special attention for rescue because IS treats them especially viciously, UofM professor Adam Muller writes. To post or not to post: Our editorial tackles the question of the decision to post the picture of little Alan Kurdi’s lifeless body on the shore in Turkey. It’s an image that derailed an election and brought the dilemma of the refugee crisis into our living rooms. Manitoba wants to do more: Premier Selinger pledged that Manitoba will wants to double the number of Syrian refugees coming to Canada Movers and shakers Provincial MLA Erin Selby announced Friday morning she will be the federal NDP candidate in St. Boniface-St. Vital, to an exuberant crowd that included MP Pat Martin,MP, right, at an event in the Glenwood Community Centre. Getting Winnipeg moving: Lawyers representing the eight objectors to the expropriation of the lands needed for phase two of bus rapid transit will make their final plea today. Closing arguments are expected to take all day as four lawyers try to convince inquiry officer George Ulyatt that the expropriation of certain parcels of land for this $590 million project are not fair or reasonable in order to meet the city’s objectives. Moving Manitoba: Construction is underway for the $204-million interchange at the Perimeter Highway and Highway 59 in northeast Winnipeg after years of planning. Premier Greg Selinger, along with officials from the province's heavy construction and trucking industries, put ceremonial shovels into the ground Thursday as large machines in the background began pushing mounds of soil. Moving out?: Erin Selby has made it official – she will take on Liberal Dan Vandal and a relatively unknown Tory in Vital. Her late entry into the federal race is expected to make it tougher for the perceived front-runner, Vandal. The NDP ran a distant third in the riding in 2011, but Selby could take away from Liberal votes. Shelly Glover, the Conservative incumbent, is not seeking re-election. Meanwhile, Selby’s departure from the provincial politics will make it that much tougher for the provincial NDP to retain her Southdale seat in next spring’s Manitoba election. In case you missed it Justice Ted Hughes. Finally: In a stunning turnaround, the Selinger government says it is now ready to proceed with key reforms of the children's advocate's role -- as recommended by the Phoenix Sinclair inquiry report -- far sooner than it originally proposed. Something’s off: If paying teachers really well translated to stellar performances from kids in the classroom, Manitoba students would be head and shoulders above others across Canada. But they’re not, of course. In fact, students in this province pretty much scrape the bottom when it comes to test results. They’re out: One of the Manitoba First Nations that Ottawa filed legal action against says it will comply, but a stalemate with its financial managers isn't helping matters.Like many First Nations, Roseau objects to federal funding laws that require disclosure of salaries and expenses paid to chief and council and the release of consolidated revenues. Other voices A long march: Up to a thousand people – young and old, some in wheelchairs or on crutches, others barefoot, some with children in buggies, others with toddlers on their shoulders – set off to walk the 170km from Budapest’s main international railway station to Austria, as Europe’s worst refugee crisis since the second world war deepened.
