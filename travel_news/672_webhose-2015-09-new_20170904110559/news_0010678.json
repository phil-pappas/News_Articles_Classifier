Additions to the schedule are made daily, as the various panels and forums become more defined by their facilitators, so check back often.\nI wanted to give you a general overview in this email so that you will be “in the know,” whether or not you are joining us in Mexico City in November. This may be one of the most important Summits we have ever had—because we are at a tipping point. I am so thrilled that we selected the theme of “Building a Well World” because that is a fantastic description of exactly what is happening, as we all recognize that this is now a shared responsibility.\nFor those who are new to our Summit, here is a bit of history. Our first Summit, known then as the Global Spa Summit, was held in 2007. In 2010, we changed the name to the Global Spa & Wellness Summit, which reflected the broadening of the conversation, as the spa world’s reputation for pampering and luxury for the elite was distracting from the good that we were all focused on doing.\nA few years ago, we introduced the first Global Wellness Tourism Economy report and galvanized governments all over the world to look at the opportunities to make improving or maintaining health a part of a travel decision. We are now getting ready to introduce the first Future of Workplace Wellness report because we recognized that the corporate world is now focusing on wellness.\nAnd with those two large sectors now availing themselves of the work that spas have always done—helping people make long-term lifestyle changes—we felt confident enough to drop the term spa from our Summit’s name so that those in governments, corporations and even the medical community would be attracted to joining us. And indeed, that has been the case! This year’s GWS will have the broadest number of participants from various sectors, which will give all of us a chance to explore new business opportunities, partnerships and investment options.\nAt the same time we’re seeing that so much of new technology is related to helping improve our health and wellbeing, the medical world is tip-toeing into prevention and wellness, and wellness architecture and wellness living communities are becoming a lively part of the conversation. True to our inclusive DNA, the aspects of our Summit that have been there from the beginning—fitness, beauty, environment, nutrition and education—maintain their presence.\nPerhaps you have seen the visual in our top banner, conceived by Nancy Davis, our executive director, and executed by our Art Director Paulina Tracz. We feel this graphic embodies our message, and it will be featured prominently at the Summit.\nThere has never been so much momentum in our industry, and I can’t wait to engage in the conversations that will help shape its future course. Having a broader conversation is going to be good for all of us, as we see the value of what we do become understood and embraced globally. We would love to have you join our exchange of ideas outlined in this year’s “Building a Well World” agenda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:36:15.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
