Published on : Tuesday, September 8, 2015\nThe IWA Specialised Conference on Design, Operation and Economics of “Large Wastewater Treatment Plants” (LWWTP) will take place from the 6th until the 9th of September, 2015 in Diplomat hotel Prague.This is the 3rd conference which is organised in Prague by the Czech Water Association (CzWA) as the national member of the International Water Association (IWA). Czech Republic is highlighted by IWA as a good example of how to efficiently and effectively spend EU Funds in the water infrastructure, therefore,the meeting is expected to be intensive and the debates active.\nIWA is an organisation that brings together people from across the water profession to deliver equitable and sustainable water solutions. Towards a world in which water is wisely managed to satisfy the needs of human activities and ecosystems in an equitable and sustainable way.\nHaving chosen Prague as the location of the 13th conference of LWWTP shows that the topic of wastewater treatment is important and relevant to central Europe. Prof. Jiří Wanner, as the Head of the Local Organising Committee, believes in two main strong advantages of the conference – effectiveness of information exchanged and the social dimension of the conference. To secure a high quality conference, the C-IN team provides LWWTP with professional organisational services.\nThe president of IWA, Prof. Helmut Kroiss, stresses the importance of the conference: “On a global scale,the number of large WWTP and new processes has markedly increased and will further increase during coming decades. This is a great challenge for the consultants, decision maker and economists to find the best solution for a specific location and new effluent standards for reuse and discharge.”\nThis event is addressed to the community of professionals, academia and practitioners in the waste water sector in the region and offers a great opportunity to exchange theoretical and practical issues within 11 sessions, several workshops and large poster section.Many interesting figures will have a lecture during LWWTP. One of the keynote speakers, Prof. Harro Bode from the Ruhr River Association, which is responsible for the entire water quality and quantity management of the German River Ruhr will introduce his experiences. Beside of his professional career, he won an Olympic Gold Medal in 1976 for sailing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:34:49.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
