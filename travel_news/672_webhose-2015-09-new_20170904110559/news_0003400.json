Dumont Dunes is one of the most spectacular dune systems of the Mojave Desert. Let’s explore what to do and where to go to camp at Dumont Dunes. Off of Route 127 between Baker and Shoshone, Dumont Dunes comprises 8,150 acres on Bureau of Land Management lands. The Open Area is located south of the Amargosa River and east of Highway 127. This is about 31 miles north of Baker. There is another area called The Little Dunes. This is also good for camping. The Little Dunes are immediately off of highway 127. Continue north on 127, and you come to Dumont Road. This is a dirt road that leads you to the main area of Dumont. Keep in mind; this is not a \"peace and quiet\" type of camping. Most visitors ride ATVs, motorcycles, dune buggies, and sand rails from their camp site to the dunes and surrounding areas. There are opportunities to do some exploring, hiking, bird watching, and rock hounding, if you camp a bit further closer to the hills and away from the dunes. The Little Dunes are better suited for younger and/or novice riders. Camping is close, and the off road activity tends to be a bit more mild that at the bigger dune areas. This gives them practice in a safer riding environment. The small dunes are connected to the larger dunes by a corridor. Dumont Dunes is the main field and riding area. This area has steep, sharp dunes that should only be attempted by more experienced riders. On the back side of the main dunes, there are many levels of dune sizes that are more visually easier in spotting other riders and off road vehicles. These areas also have more terrain along with sand. Russ and Lori recommend the Sperry Wash route. It is rocky and rutted, but suited for a more leisurely slow speed ride for more novice riders. Keep in mind that you are miles away from emergency services. It is crucial that you ride safely and within your own limitations. You must also be a defensive rider. Like anywhere else, there are some who choose not to abide by the rules. Be watchful of those who should be locked up for the way they operate their vehicles. There are always a few unwanted nuts in any trail mix, right? Here are a few rules and regulations. All vehicles must have a spark arrestor of muffler that is either street legal or off-highway approved. All OHV’s require a mast with a red or orange flag for visibility. Any night operated vehicles must have head and taillights. California use green stickers are required. Helmets are a must for all riders, and only one person at a time is allowed on any ATV. Any and all glass containers are prohibited. Sorry for all the rules talk, but better to know than to get there and not be properly prepared. Camping is wide open. Visitors need a pass for each vehicle \"driven’ into the dunes. This does not apply to trailers being towed and green sticker vehicles in you truck or trailer. The onsite fee machines are available and take credit cards only. No cash is accepted. Remember that the elevation at Dumont varies from 700 feet to 1,200 feet at the peak of Competition Hill. We are just coming into the season where temperatures are going to be perfect for October/November camping. There are no facilities at Dumont, other than pit toilets. There is no running water. Bring everything you need. Baker is a 30 mile drive from Dumont. Pahrump, Nevada, is a 50 mile drive. There are no campsites to reserve, no sewer hook ups. If you pack it in, pack it out. This is most excellent dry camping. Hit the dunes; meet some interesting people, and Let’s Get Rollin’!
