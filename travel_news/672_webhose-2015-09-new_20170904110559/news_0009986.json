September 9, 2015 \nCourtesy: Westin Resort & Spa \nThe deal: Stay at the recently renovated, 4-star Westin Cancun Resort & Spa for $138 to $178 per night, saving up to 50 percent off peak rates, plus a $100 credit for booking with a MasterCard.

You’re also likely to get a great view, since most rooms overlook the water. \nWhat you can do there: On-site options include water sports, tennis, and a fitness studio. Golf fanatics can find a championship course nearby, and if it’s culture you’re after, take a day trip to explore Mayan ruins. \nHow long does this deal last?
