IGLTA’s board of directors selected Ontario’s capital city – long celebrated for its vibrant LGBT community – for the 35th edition of the conference, 9-12 May 2018.\nThe convention, the leading educational and networking event for the LGBT tourism industry, will take place at the downtown Westin Harbour Castle hotel on the shores of Lake Ontario.\n“Canada stands at the forefront of gay and lesbian rights, and our 2009 convention in Toronto was one of our best attended,” says IGLTA Board Chair Dan Melesurgo. “Toronto is truly a diverse, multicultural city that has world-class attractions and unique neighborhoods, including a large and popular gay village. We’re excited to return in 2018 and set the bar even higher.”\nToronto’s reputation as an LGBT-welcoming destination continues to grow. WorldPride 2014 united advocates and allies from around the globe in Toronto, attracting an estimated 2 million visitors over the course of the 10-day festival. The city’s annual gay pride event is one of the largest in North America.\n“Our tourism community looks forward to welcoming IGLTA in 2018,” said Andrew Weir, Chief Marketing Officer of Tourism Toronto. “The world is taking notice of Toronto’s vibrancy and progressive spirit that makes this not only a welcoming destination but also one of North America’s most exciting cities to explore.”\nSource:-IGLTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:37:29.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
