It’s the perfect spot for a bit of sun and a relaxing few days by the beach. I like to go there when I occasionally get the odd week off during the rugby season. It’s an ultra-modern and very cool place to visit, with so many attractions to see as well. It’s about a seven-hour flight away from Britain but I have visited Dubai several times with my partner, Mallory. And nearly everyone speaks English. So what’s not to like? The Dubai Marina by night, with a view of the Burj Khalifa Photo: Alamy Anything special I should pack? Shorts, T-shirts and pool attire are pretty much all you need during the day. You might need something a bit more formal for eating out in the evening. What’s the first thing you do on arrival? I’m usually in Dubai after a couple of tough back-to-back games, so on the first day I like to relax at the hotel by the pool, go for a swim and get a bit of sun. After that, I like to head somewhere like the Dubai Mall and have a browse of its 1,000-plus shops to perhaps treat Mallory with something special. • 36 Hours in Dubai Jumeirah Beach Photo: Fotolia/AP Where is the best place to stay? Every time I go I try to stay somewhere different, but one of the best hotels I’ve stayed at is the five-star Address Dubai Marina Hotel (00971 4436 7777; theaddress.com ), which is super-modern, offers first-class service and has a rooftop pool overlooking the Dubai Marina and the emirate’s golden beaches. • The best hotels in Dubai The Address Dubai Marina Hotel Where would you meet friends for a drink? There are no British-style pubs out there but I found a great place to go for a drink called 360° (00971 4366 5866; jumeirah.com ) at the end of the marina walkway of the Jumeirah Beach Hotel. It has a good selection of beers and cocktails, and boasts fantastic views. The locals are fine about tourists drinking, so long as you’re discreet and do it in a hotel or other licensed premises. • The best places for nightlife in Dubai The Jumeirah Beach Hotel The best place for lunch? I’m particularly fond of Pierchic (00971 4366 6730; jumeirah.com ), a high-end seafood restaurant that is part of the Madinat Jumeirah Hotel (00971 4366 8888; jumeirah.com ). It is at the end of a pier, surrounded by the sea, and looks out towards the Burj Al Arab (00971 4301 7777; jumeirah.com ). You’re unlikely to want a lot to eat at lunch, due to the heat. So I usually have a bit of fish or a salad, which usually keeps me going until the evening. • The best restaurants in Dubai Madinat Jumeirah Hotel Photo: Fotolia/AP And for dinner? I had some wonderful sushi at the Hashi restaurant of the Armani Hotel (00971 4888 3888; dubai.armanihotels.com ), which is near the foot of the Burj Khalifa (see below). It was a really standout meal that was just as good as anything I’ve had in London. Where would you send a first-time visitor? You’ve got to go to the Burj Khalifa (00971 4366 1655; burjkhalifa.ae ), the world’s tallest building. It’s around 2,700ft tall and dwarfs Dubai’s other high-rise buildings. The views from the 124th-floor observation deck are out of this world. Another must-see place is Jumeirah Beach, which is lined with restaurants. Whenever I’m there, I have to go for a swim in the wonderfully warm, clear water, which is so different from braving the sea back home. Finally, make sure you visit the Bur Dubai, the  oldest part of the city, which offers a fascinating glimpse into its past. • The best attractions in Dubai Dubai Creek Photo: Fotolia/AP What should I avoid? First and foremost, avoid offending the locals. Yes, Dubai is quite liberal compared to much of the Middle East, but it’s still pretty conservative by Western standards. Thankfully, having lived there before, Mallory was quick to fill me in on things like the dress code, and other dos and don’ts. Also, avoid spending too much time in the sun. It’s very hot and you can get burnt if you’re not careful. What should I bring home? The locals are really keen on designer labels. All of the shops are full of designer goodies, although the prices seem to be similar to back home in Britain. • The best places for shopping in Dubai Palm Jumeirah Photo: Fotolia/AP Anywhere that isn’t your kind of town? I’ll never forget going to the Sussex seaside as a schoolboy – it was raining, the beach was stony and the sea was freezing cold.
