There have also been improvements to the westbound access roads to the M11 and A14 at the Girton interchange.\n“We recognise the scheme has taken longer than anticipated and we will be carrying out a debrief with our contractor, Costain and supervisor Amey, to understand how we can prevent similar issues happening in the future. We will be returning for a period of two weeks later in the year to complete the outstanding landscaping works, which we can’t complete now as we have to wait for the planting season to commence. However, this work will be completed overnight under lane closures only.”\n– Aran Nugent, Highways England The improvements on the A14 are part of Highways England’s £317m pinch point programme to improve more than 100 congestion hotspots nationwide.\nConstruction work started in April 2014 and was completed on Sunday 13th September.\nLast updated Fri 18 Sep 2015 Travel Cambridgeshire Girton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:56:12.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
