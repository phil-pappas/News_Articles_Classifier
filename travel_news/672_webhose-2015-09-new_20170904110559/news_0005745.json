It was a huge undertaking — the entire exterior was covered in scaffolding, all the way to the top of the two 330-foot-tall spires, and it was washed clean of decades of dirt. Inside, workers cleaned and repaired the 3,700 individual panels in 75 stained-glass windows and restored the 9,200-pound bronze entrance doors. \nSt. Patrick’s held its first Mass in 1879 and became a national landmark in 1976. At $175 million, the restoration was the most extensive since the 1940s. \nSome thoughts from people who worked on the project: Not your everyday worksite \nOne tricky aspect: The cathedral stayed open to the public the entire time. Work was done around daily Masses and while 5 million visitors a year passed through. \n“It would be a constant dance as we were moving around,” said Eileen McCarthy, a project manager from Structure Tone. \n“For the most part, everything was done during the day while it was occupied, while tourists and guests and visitors were coming through, so that was always a concern; you’re working in a living, breathing environment.” \nConstruction workers had to learn how to use their “inside voices” but were also given a chance to interact with the public. \n“People will stop and ask” about the work, she said. “It’s very cool, you can explain a little bit of what’s going on.” Moving moments \nThe renovation also led to some unexpected moments of grace. McCarthy remembers a time in late 2013 when she and painters were up on scaffolding above the central part of the cathedral, hidden from view . \n“All of a sudden, a capella, was a young woman’s voice, singing Ave Maria ,” she said. “All of us just froze, we stopped in our tracks.” Perfect timing \nThe project seemed to have the luck of the Irish. Jeff Keeley, a foreman for the scaffolding company, said it was “very uneventful.” There were no safety incidents, and clear skies and good weather were on hand when they needed it. \nPope Francis is scheduled to be at St. Patrick’s on Thursday for evening prayers. \nKeeley said workers were excited to find out their efforts would be seen by the head of the church. \n“Sometimes you do things, and no one really cares,” he said. “When the pope comes, hopefully he will care, right?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:12:41.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
