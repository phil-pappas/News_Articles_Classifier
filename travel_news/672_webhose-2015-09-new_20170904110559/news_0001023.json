To Expand Tee Time Distribution  \nEZLinks Golf LLC, a PGA TOUR affiliated company, announced the acquisition of GolfSwitch Inc., the golf industry’s leading integration platform, connecting more than 40 tee sheets and thousands of golf courses with hundreds of distribution channels worldwide. The acquisition makes it simple for golfers to book and for golf courses to sell tee times anywhere.\n \n“EZLinks Golf is committed to creating a more competitive marketplace for golf courses and golfers alike,” said Gary Cohen, chief executive officer, EZLinks Golf. “The GolfSwitch platform provides all golf courses with the opportunity to market and sell their inventory through multiple distributions channels, including TeeOff.com by PGA TOUR.”\n \nJo Maes, Director of European Operations for GolfSwitch, part of EZLinks Golf LLC adds: “EZLinks Golf has maintained a long-standing relationship with GolfSwitch and has always sought opportunities to expand distribution for golf courses. This motivation coupled with the newly formed relationship with the PGA TOUR creates a positive force in the industry and will build upon the GolfSwitch platform making it easer for courses to reach a larger audience. I’m proud that the GolfSwitch platform is part of this largest organisation.”\n \nPromoted to millions of golfers through PGATOUR.com, PGA TOUR events and through national television, radio and digital advertising targeting golfers, TeeOff.com by PGA TOUR is one of more than a hundred distribution channels golf courses can connect with through the Golf Switch platform. Other distribution outlets include resort properties, travel packagers, Open Tee, Golf 18 Network and more.\n \n“As a significant shareholder in EZLinks Golf, the PGA TOUR is excited and supportive of the acquisition and EZLinks efforts to grow and expand the game,” said Tom Wade, the Chief Commercial Officer of the PGA TOUR.\n \nIn addition to the GolfSwitch distribution platform, EZLinks Golf LLC acquired the Open Tee tee time reservation platform and consumer site.\n \nJo Maes, Director of European Operations GolfSwitch, part of EZLinks Golf LLC will be attending IGTM in Tenerife in October to answer any questions courses and partners may have about this exciting development.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:23:45.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
