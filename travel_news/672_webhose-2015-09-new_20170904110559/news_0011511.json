Thome, eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 04, 2015 eTN   \nDamage caused to the a Boeing B737 in August, when loose tarmac slaps hit the stabilizers of the aircraft as it sped down the runway for takeoff, has been more serious than initially thought. \nRepairs of the damaged section of the hull and stabilizers were initially due to be completed by September 6. Meanwhile, operations were halted as Korongo Airlines was unable to lease a suitable aircraft to keep flights from Lubumbashi to Johannesburg, Kinshasa and Mbuji Mayi. \nKorongo was formed through a partnership between Brussels Airlines and local Congolese businessmen and has been successfully operating since April 2012, presently the only carrier meeting EASAâ€™s safety standards and, therefore, not included on the blacklist which otherwise extends to all other Congolese-registered airlines. \nIt is, therefore, with some consternation that news was received an hour ago from Lubumbashi that the board of directors of Korongo, in an extraordinary meeting of the shareholders on September 4, decided to liquidate the airline. The company cited adverse operating conditions, both vis-a-vis the damage sustained to their single B737 as well as other factors. Ticketholders can expect a full refund and need to contact the appointed liquidators, one Mr. Patrick William, at the company offices in Lubumbashi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:38:51.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
