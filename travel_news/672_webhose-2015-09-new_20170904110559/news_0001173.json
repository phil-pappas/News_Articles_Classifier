And we do unusual things.\" \nA race of dachshunds outfitted in a hot dog bun costume, for example. \nMany Americans associate the short-legged, long-bodied dogs with Germany, and their sausage-like shape inspired the nickname 'wieners.' \nThe dachshunds run down a racetrack in downtown Cincinnati while their owners try to lure them to the finish line. \n\"My wife Jodi and I have German heritage and we love Oktoberfest\", Cincinnati resident Henry Stacey told AFP, proudly holding the winning wiener Max in his arms. \nUS census figures show that more than 46 million Americans trace their roots back to German families, making German-Americans the largest ethnic group by national ancestry in the United States. \nImmigrants from German-speaking states ventured across the Atlantic mostly in the 19th and early 20th century, seeking political freedom and economic opportunities, and many settled in Midwestern cities like Milwaukee, St. Louis and Cincinnati. \n\"Probably half of the population of the Cincinnati area has German ancestry,\" Tolzmann said. \n\"And in the 19th century, they were concentrating in Over-the-Rhine.\" \n- Cincinnati's German roots - \nThe area north of downtown Cincinnati overlooking the Ohio River was once home to more than 44,000 people, making it the second-most populated US neighborhood outside of Lower Manhattan. \nIn 2010, this number was down to about 6,000. \nOver-the-Rhine became \"shorthand for urban decline,\" said Joe Brinker, who is co-producing a documentary film on efforts to revitalize the neighborhood. \nMany of the buildings bearing inscriptions in German lay vacant, as the now mostly African-American population struggles with violence, drug crime and poverty. \nAt one point billed the most dangerous zip code in the country, Over-the-Rhine was the epicenter of race riots after a white policeman killed an African-American teenager in 2001. \nOver the past few years, a slew of new art galleries, restaurants and bars have changed the neighborhood, leading also to a rediscovery of the German heritage. \nA local brewer reopened the historic Moerlein brewery, which was forced to close after Prohibition hit in 1919, reintroducing several classic Cincinnati beer brands. \nWiesnkoenig, the official lederhosen supplier of the Munich Oktoberfest, opened their first US store in Over-the-Rhine last year. \n\"At first we were concerned that we would attract only German-American clubs, but that's not the case,\" Oliver Pfund from Wiesnkoenig USA told AFP. \n\"We are getting a lot of young people who don't necessarily have a German background, but who want to dress up for Oktoberfest.\" \nReferring to the fashion-conscious 20- and 30-somethings that have started moving back into Over-the-Rhine, Pfund added: \"And we have of course the hipsters who understand that you can wear a pair of cool lederhosen with T-shirts and Chucks.\" Tell us what you think about this article Like dislike 0 people liked / 0 people disliked it Share this article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T07:06:41.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
