The new aircraft will serve four new routes from Warsaw to Aberdeen, Bari, Bristol and Reykjavik, and increase the frequencies on some of WIZZ’s more popular routes from the Polish capital. Wizz Air further announced a new Poznan route to Birmingham, which will start operating from 18 December 2015.\nWizz Air has seen a 30 percent increase in traffic on Polish routes in the first nine months of 2015 compared with the first nine months of 2014. In addition to adding a sixth aircraft at Warsaw Chopin Airport next year, WIZZ will replace two A320s based there now with two larger A321 aircraft starting next summer. The higher seat capacity of these state-of-the-art aircraft will help to keep operating costs low and offer more seats and more low fares for consumers.\nSince beginning operations 11 years ago, WIZZ has carried 39 million passengers from Polish airports, equivalent to every citizen of Poland making at least one flight on Wizz Air.\nWith this expansion, Wizz Air now offers a total of 122 routes to 20 countries from Poland. Seats on the new routes are already on sale and can be booked on wizzair.com.\nWIZZ AIR’S NEW ROUTES FROM WARSAW:\nDestination\nDays\nStarts\nFares From*\nAberdeen\nMonday, Thursday\n13 May\nPLN 119\nBari\nWednesday, Sunday\n13 May\nPLN 119\nBristol\nWednesday, Sunday\n13 May\nPLN 119\nReykjavik\nWednesday, Sunday\n13 May\nPLN 159\nWIZZ AIR’S NEW ROUTE FROM POZNAN:\nDestination\nDays\nStarts\nFares From*\nBirmingham\nMonday, Friday\n18 Dec\nPLN 99\nFREQUENCY INCREASES ON EXISTING ROUTES FROM WARSAW:\nDestination\nWeekly Flights\nFrom Date\nLondon Luton\n26 from 23\n13 May\nStockholm Skavsta\n7 from 6\n13 May\nBudapest\n7 from 6\n13 May\nOslo Torp\n7 from 5\n13 May\nDoncaster\n4 from 3\n13 May\nKutaisi\n3 from 2\n13 May\nBirmingham\n3 from 2\n13 May\nCatania\n2 from 1\n13 May\nSpeaking at a press conference in Warsaw today, József Váradi, CEO of Wizz Air said: “ I’m delighted that our Polish business keeps growing after a year of almost 30 percent capacity growth in our six Polish bases. By adding a sixth aircraft to our Warsaw base, we respond to demand and continue investing in offering low fares from Warsaw’s main airport. To underline our commitment to the Polish market, we will begin replacing some A320s with larger A321s starting next year to add more travel opportunities and continued low fares. The growth of WIZZ in Poland is also an opportunity for the creation of more Polish aviation and aviation related jobs around the country.”\nSource:- Wizz Air", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:55:37.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
