It’s exciting to see Huseyin Sami, an acclaimed artist from Western Sydney, given this opportunity and I look forward to the big reveal of his projection art next year.”\nEach year, an Australian artist represented in the MCA Collection or exhibition program, is chosen to work in collaboration with projection content creators to create the amazing 3D-mapped projections that adorn the MCA façade during Vivid Sydney.\nHuseyin Sami is a former exhibitor in MCA’s annual Primavera exhibition, highlighting the work of young Australian artists. His work explores the material qualities of paint, crossing over the categories of painting, sculpture and installation. He has exhibited extensively both nationally and internationally.\nMuseum of Contemporary Art Australia Director, Elizabeth Ann Macgregor OBE, said, “We are delighted that the involvement of artists in the creation of the work for the MCA façade for Vivid Sydney will continue with the commissioning of Huseyin Sami, one of a generation of younger artists working with materials such as paint in exciting new ways. We look forward to seeing how his vision comes to fruition on our façade.”\nDestination NSW Chief Executive Officer, Sandra Chipchase, added that there is still time for projection content creators to submit Expressions of Interest for the MCA Original Façade, with the deadline extended to Midnight AEST, 7 October 2015.\nVivid Sydney is managed by the NSW Government’s tourism and major events agency Destination NSW, and returns from 27 May to 13 June 2016.\nSource:- Destination NSW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T08:26:59.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
