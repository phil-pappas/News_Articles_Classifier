Corp. has brought year-round versatility and winter-weather safety together in one with Toyo ® Celsius ® , the revolutionary new variable-conditions tire. Toyo Tires ® created the new segment called \"Variable-Conditions\" in order to define the unique capabilities of this product.\nBuilt for the varying road conditions that drivers may face, Celsius picks up where all-season tires fall short. It provides better ice and snow traction than a typical all-season tire, yet offers the convenience of year-round use and a 60,000-mile treadwear warranty*. For vehicle owners, this means year-round versatility plus winter-weather safety… all in one tire.\nThe new Celsius is for the many drivers, who for one reason or another, choose not to switch to winter tires when snow and ice hit the ground. It is ideal for people who live in states where they may drive to work in dry conditions, only to have a fast-moving winter storm leave snow on the roads for the commute home. It is also great for people who may live in an area below a mountain resort where they commute often for work or play. Parents will find Celsius convenient when equipping the car of a college-bound teen with new tires.\n\"Toyo Celsius is an upgrade for anyone expecting, or not expecting, to drive in ice and snow this winter on all-season tires,\" said Roy Bromfield , COO, Toyo Tire U.S.A. Corp. \"The convenience and safety of Celsius is a tremendous benefit in today's busy world and answers the demand for hassle-free, one-stop solutions.\"\nIndependent third-party testing found Celsius stopped up to 31 feet shorter on snow and eight feet shorter on ice than a typical all-season tire.* The tire features the Three-Peak Mountain Snowflake like a winter tire which means it meets or exceeds industry-established snow traction performance requirements.\nVariable tread technology results in an asymmetric tire which has a visibly different tread from inside-to-outside. Snow claws are located at the base of the outer circumferential grooves to help improve deep snow traction while providing block rigidity for better ice and wet traction. Deep slush grooves help evacuate heavy slush and snow from the tire for increased traction.\nThe Celsius family of tires includes Celsius ® for passenger cars and Celsius ® CUV for crossovers. In addition to a 60,000-mile treadwear warranty, Celsius qualifies for the Toyo Tires No Regrets Trial Offer* which ensures drivers are completely satisfied with their purchase.
