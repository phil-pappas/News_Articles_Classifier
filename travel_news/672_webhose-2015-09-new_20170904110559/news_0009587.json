A former linebacker for the New England Patriots, Bruschi said Deflategate has negatively shifted the perception of the NFL.\n“We used to look at the league as a entity of authority,” Bruschi said in a Vine from NFL on ESPN . “Now players look at it as an entity of incompetence.”\nRoger Goodell suspended Tom Brady four games for his role in the Deflategate scandal. But that suspension was vacated by District Court Judge Richard M Berman on Thursday. In the 40-page ruling, Berman provided analysis of Goodell’s arbitration process, writing Goodell “may be said to have dispensed his own brand of industrial justice. ”\n Bruschi pointed out Goodell’s history of flawed procedure in handling the punishment of players and teams, likely in reference to similar scandals like Bountygate and Ray Rice’s punishment.\n“The leader of the NFL is making the NFL look ridiculous. He looks ridiculous,” Bruschi said on ESPN’s SportsCenter . “Those thirty-two owners need to realize their business—their billion dollar baby—looks ridiculous.”\nBruschi said the NFL’s decision to appeal the ruling would further drag the NFL through the mud. The NFL announced it plans to appeal on Thursday .\nTop 10 Recent Patriots Controversies, Ranked\nPrevious -- of -- Next The Patriot’s successes over the past two decades have not come without controversy.
