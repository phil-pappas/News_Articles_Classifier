Identifying the people in the images is harder but even more important. Without identification, the photographs are anonymous, unsearchable artifacts. \nMost of the donated photographs had at least a family name or a date, but thousands had no identifying marks. They were simply passport photos and ID photos showing the faces of Juneau residents 50 or so years ago. \n\"We really needed to convert the negatives to something we could ID from,\" DeBruyne said. \nTo do that, museum staff were inspired in part by something they already had: a photo collage of Juneau pioneers that dates from the first decade of the 20th century. \nAs you walk in the door of the museum, it hangs on the right. Tiny photographs fill most of an ornate frame, and each photograph is labeled with the name of its subject. Facing the frame on the opposite wall is its modern counterpart: rows of photographs printed on vinyl and stuck on the wall. \nDigitally, the museum is sharing additional unidentified photos via Facebook and on its website. \nThe effort has had some success. \"On the wall, we've gotten about 60 identifications out of about 212, which is awesome,\" DeBruyne said. \"On Facebook, I post one every Wednesday, and we've got about 11 out of 30 identifications there.\" \nAnother 80 photographs have been identified via the museum's website. \nSome of the photographs on the wall now bear small notes that attest the person's name, but DeBruyne isn't just collecting that; she also wants information about each person — where they worked, what clubs they belonged to, and more. \n\"It's really great information because it helps us create that story for people coming to look up information on their great-great-great-great grandparents,\" she said. \"It's really heartwarming to connect these photographs to the people.\" \nOne of the more convenient connections was Barbara Potter. Her photograph was an easy match — she volunteers at the museum's front desk. Her husband's photograph was among the anonymous passport photos. \n\"I knew Joe Alexander had taken the pictures, but that was a surprise,\" she said. \"When I first came here, he was the photographer who took everything.\" \nAlexander shot her wedding photos in 1964, and one photograph accompanies a display on Alexander's life. In addition to the photo ID project, the museum's summer exhibit is a retrospective on the lives of six Juneau photographers. \n\"I think it's a neat project, I really do,\" Potter said. \"I enjoyed looking at it.\" \nThe museum's summer exhibit, including the Juneau Who's Who display, will be available through Sept. 24. After that, the museum will close to replace the carpeting in its Juneau history gallery. The fate of the Who's Who display hasn't been determined, but for now the Facebook posts will continue. \nSaid DeBruyne: \"I'm going to continue that since everybody loves it so much.\" \nInformation from: Juneau (Alaska) Empire, http://www.juneauempire.com \n  \nIn this photo taken Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2105, Jodi DeBruyne, curator of collections and exhibits at the Juneau-Douglas City Museum, looks at some of the original 4x5 inch negatives of portraits made by Juneau photographer Joe Alexander from the 1950's to the 1980's in Juneau, Alaska. DeBruyne has started a project to identify between 2,000 and 3,000 people in Alexander's photographs. The photos were donated by Susan Derrera, daughter of photographer, who lived in Juneau from the late 1940s to the 1980s.
