More Abe shifts context of Japan’s war apology \nFor more than five decades, the low-lit, low-rise hotel in the heart of the Japanese capital has had this effect on visitors: normalising the sotto-voce exchange, discreetly imposing discretion, draining brashness from the world outside with dun carpets, thick whisky tumblers and wood panelling and seducing with its aura of the 1960s. \nBut none of this has ensured the Okura’s survival in its current form. Earthquake-proofing standards have been tightened, cheap Y3,000-a-night business hotels and high-end competitors dominate the Tokyo market and Japan’s relentless tradition of demolish and rebuild is claiming another citadel. \nAt midnight on Monday, the lights of the lobby went dark and Okura staff, with unflinching politeness, asked the last of the visitors to leave. Outside, a ripple of applause followed the extinguishing of the front lights as the concierge strung rope across the revolving front doors for the last time and bowed. \nPetitions, mostly signed by non-Japanese, had attempted to save the hotel from the bulldozers — it has long been a favourite with diplomats from the US embassy just around the corner. \n“Japan renews everything all the time, but it would be good if just a few things could remain in place forever,” said Tatsuko Fujii, a Tokyo resident who had previously written to the Okura management to demand a stay of execution. “They may preserve some of the furniture and put it in the new place, but it can never be the same.” \nBut most locals, despite a last heave of sentiment on its final night, appear to accept that the Okura must follow the rest of Tokyo down a path that has built higher and stronger with every passing year. Japan renews everything all the time, but it would be good if just a few things could remain in place forever \n- Tatsuko Fujii, Tokyo resident \nConstructed two years ahead of Tokyo’s 1964 Olympics and designed by Yoshiro Taniguchi, the Okura was a prominent symbol of the city’s post war revitalisation. \nFor foreigners — a historic guest list that includes seven US presidents, film stars and blue-chip corporate leaders — it has been the epitome of a Japan imagined from afar: impeccably mannered, obsessively aesthetic and stubbornly eccentric. \nFor Japanese, it was a place where the best of Japan continued to be done better than anywhere — an irresistible relic from a moment in history when the country put wartime defeat in its past and regained the old conviction that it was world class. The Fast Lane \nLet’s save a masterpiece \nThe Okura in Tokyo — the last great 1960s original in that city  and one of the most loved modernist hotels in the world — is to be ripped down \nOn Monday night, in the hours before the pentagon-leafed chandeliers of the Okura’s main wing were finally dimmed to black, hundreds of Japanese came for a final glimpse. \nSome were close to tears. Some recalled breakfast visits taken as children to the café. A former hostess had come to relish the memory of drinks with clients in the thick air of the Orchid Bar in its 1980s bubble heyday. Two brothers, now in their late 50s, recalled the day that their father sold the family textile business with a handshake over a table in the hotel’s sushi restaurant. \nThe demise of the Okura’s main building, along with its modernist lobby, its retro corridors and now badly outdated guest rooms, will make way for a $1bn modernisation project, timed for completion ahead of Tokyo’s 2020 Olympics and masterminded by Yoshio Taniguchi, the original architect’s son.
