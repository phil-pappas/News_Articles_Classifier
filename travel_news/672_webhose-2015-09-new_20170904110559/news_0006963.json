The first, just within 2kms of the airport fence, is 35 metres from the M4 motorway, at which only 16% of the pollution comes from airport-related sources, while the other is beside a busy road junction in an urban centre, and the airport’s emissions are only 6% of its total. Put another way, even if Heathrow were completely closed down immediately, there would still be exceedances at these two locations. The latest forecasts by Defra show that both of these monitors are expected to be compliant by 2020, five years ahead of areas of central London. \nThis graphic is consistent with the conclusions of the Airports Commission, set up by the Prime Minister, which concluded Heathrow air quality in the future will be better than now. Following a £20 million, two and a half year detailed study of where the next runway should be, the Commission has confirmed a third runway at Heathrow can go ahead without breaching air quality legal limits, as long as the airport continues to implement its mitigation plans. \nMatt Gorman, Heathrow Director of Environment and Sustainability said: “Heathrow understands air quality is a real concern for local communities and it’s an issue London needs to tackle urgently. We have made it clear that Heathrow airport has and will continue to play its part. But this data shows that the real culprit of pollution in London is road traffic, so we need other partners to play their role. We’re working with partners like the Mayor’s office on a strategy to reduce emissions from non-airport related road-traffic which is the major cause of pollution in the Heathrow area.” \nThe airport already has an excellent record of improving air quality, and have reduced annual emissions from airport activity by 16% over five years. Heathrow’s Blueprint for Reducing Emissions outlines a 10 point plan of tangible actions to reduce Heathrow’s emissions, including a commitment to turn every car or small van we own to electric by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:36:02.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
