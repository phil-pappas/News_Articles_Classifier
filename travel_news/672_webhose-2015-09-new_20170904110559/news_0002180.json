Kammeyer saw in her family practice were people in need of help with pain management, according to the state Department of Health. After the deaths of two patients this year, the state and the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began investigating Kammeyer.\nOn Sept. 1, the health department charged her with “unprofessional conduct by improperly prescribing opioid medication to numerous patients.” Her medical license, issued in 1981, was immediately suspended.\nAccording to the statement of health-department charges: “The evidence shows a pattern of incompetence and negligence which created an unreasonable risk of harm and/or the deaths of three individuals, two of whom were her patients.”\n Kammeyer has 20 days from the charging date to respond, said department spokeswoman Kelly Stowe.\n“She has the right to tell her side of the story,” Stowe said.\nKammeyer, 65, could not be reached Friday. Her office phone went unanswered and a voice-mail box was full.\nKammeyer has not been charged with a crime.\nAccording to the health department, complaints were filed against Kammeyer in 1989, 1997, twice in 1998, 2001 and in 2009. All of the complaints were closed without discipline, agency officials said.\nThe charges, signed by Assistant Attorney General Kristin G. Brewer and Melanie de Leon, executive director of the state Medical Quality Commission, say Kammeyer is not a pain-management specialist and is “wholly unqualified” to run a pain-management practice.\nAfter investigating the records of the two women who died, one Feb. 10 and the other March 22, as well as looking at the records of another 10 patients, investigators concluded Kammeyer was improperly prescribing oxycodone, OxyContin, methadone, Valium, Xanax and Ativan. In many cases patients were taking lethal combinations of narcotics, the charges said.\nThe DEA started a separate undercover investigation into Kammeyer, using an employee of hers to write a prescription for someone she had never seen or met, according to the Department of Health.\nDEA spokeswoman Jodi Underwood said Kammeyer “is the subject of an ongoing DEA investigation.” Underwood declined to comment any further.\nThe patient who died March 22 is referred to in the health-department charges as “Patient A.” She had a lethal combination of fentanyl, oxycodone and oxymorphone in her system — all medications prescribed by Kammeyer for chronic-pain management, fibromyalgia and mental illness, according to the charges. While the woman’s chart notes appear to have ended on Dec. 22, 2014, Kammeyer continued to prescribe her medication until March 12, charges said.\nThe woman who died Feb. 10, labeled “Patient B,” had a combination of alprazolam, oxycodone, ethanol, cannabis-related products and opiates in her system, according to the Department of Health. Kammeyer was treating the woman for chronic-pain syndrome, mental-health issues, hypertension and a “host of other illnesses,” charging documents said.\nIn addition to her two patients, the health-department charging documents allege Kammeyer contributed to the death of a third person, an adult grandson of “Patient A.” One of the woman’s fentanyl pain patches was found in his mouth.\nNews researcher Miyoko Wolf contributed to this report.
