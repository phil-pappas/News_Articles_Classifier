Picture: FINANCIAL MAIL Related articles Joint venture can meet packaging demand in southern Africa Nampak to make bottles in Nigeria and Ethiopia NIGERIAN aluminium beverage can maker GZ Industries (GZI) and SA’s Golden Era Packaging have signed a joint venture agreement valued at R1bn to set up a factory making 1.2-billion cans a year in Johannesburg.\nCalled Gayatri GZI Beverage Cans, the venture between a major West African producer of packaging and one of SA’s largest independent packagers intends to meet growing demand for beer and other alcoholic and soft drinks in Southern Africa. Production will begin in the second quarter of next year.\nGolden Era has supply chain and customer relationships in SA and across Southern Africa. The factory will manufacture two-piece aluminium beverage cans in multiple sizes, using state-of-the-art technology.\n\"GZI is committed to its strategy of becoming sub-Saharan Africa’s largest packaging solution provider to the beverage industry,\" CEO Motti Goldmintz said on Tuesday.\nThe partnership with Golden Era accelerated access to new markets as the group consolidated its expansion in West and East Africa, he said.\nStandard Chartered Private Equity, the investment arm of Standard Chartered Bank, holds 37% of GZI. The venture is 55% owned by GZI and 45% owned by Golden Era, with each contributing factory equipment and cash funding, respectively.\n\"The South African (joint venture) will employ 80 to 100 workers in its first phase of production. This is expected to increase to about 150 within the next two years,\" Peter Baird, head of private equity for Africa at Standard Chartered in Johannesburg, said on Tuesday. He is also GZI board spokesman.\n\"We already have all the machinery and are finalising civil engineering and construction,\" Mr Baird said.\nThe South African market could absorb about 4-billion steel and aluminium beverage cans a year, he said.\nAluminium cans are now preferred as they are lighter to transport, they cool drinks more quickly, and are easily and cost-effectively recycled.\nGolden Era would finance working capital and some construction costs, Mr Baird said. The joint venture intended to break even within a year of starting operations, he said.\n\"As far as we know, SA is the largest (beverage) can market in the world that has only one supplier,\" he said.\nThat supplier is JSE-listed Nampak, Africa’s largest diversified packaging company. The group has large aluminium beverage cans operations in SA, Angola and Nigeria.\n\"We welcome the competition and believe the newly announced investment will (enable the) beverage can market in SA (to grow) even faster,\" Nampak CEO André de Ruyter said on Tuesday.\n\"We also think that this investment will further stimulate local skills development and the procurement of South African raw materials,\" he said.\nThe new plant will give GZI capacity to make more than 3.5-billion aluminium beverage cans a year.\n\"We have an aggressive acquisition strategy in sub-Saharan Africa and strongly believe that Golden Era are ideal partners to help us achieve our pan-African vision,\" Mr Goldmintz said.\nGolden Era CEO Kishor Chhita said on Tuesday the collaboration with GZI would enable the group to grow its South African operations and offer a more comprehensive range of packaging solutions to customers. It would also leverage the skills and footprint of one of Africa’s leading beverage can manufacturers.\n\"We are particularly excited about the highly skilled employment opportunities that this partnership will create.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:37:00.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
