But for all the appeal of a vintage dwelling, lots of Victoriana, and sea captains’ trophies from the China Trade, two of the most appealing parts of the museum belong firmly to the 20th century.\nAlice Stallknecht created a stir when she painted her first mural series in 1931. A triptych called “Christ Preaching to the Multitude,” it featured local businessman “Slim” Hutchings as Christ in modern clothes. (“Imagine Christ with a belt!” Time magazine Quote: d one local woman in an article entitled “Holy Dory!”)\nContinue reading below\nStallknecht convinced the Congregational Church to hang it in the vestibule. In 1935, she painted “The Circle Supper,” depicting the weekly church supper. It also hung in the church — until Stallknecht was asked to remove the paintings in 1943 for reasons never revealed. She mounted them in a barn on her property and painted a third series, “Every Man to His Trade,” to fill the empty wall. After she died in 1973, the paintings were restored and donated to the museum.\nWith their frank portrayals of townspeople and their thematic linking of democracy and Protestant piety, the Stallknecht murals freeze Chatham in mid-20th century — a town where fishing, voting, and praying characterized the populace. The artist’s Expressionist style came from her unusual way of working. During the hour she asked her neighbors to pose, she would sketch the outlines of their portraits in charcoal, then fill in the details with paint later on.\nEqually expressive of an era, the Nickerson Camp is a wooden duck hunting and fishing camp that stood on a part of North Beach that has since been swept away. The summer cottage, floated to the mainland in 1991, is complete to every detail — including the nearly empty liquor bottles left for those who might have taken refuge in a storm.\nGreat For : Taking a break from sunning and wading at nearby Oyster Pond Beach\nDon’t Miss : Portraits of Chatham sea captains by Alice’s son, Frederick Wight\nDetail s : 347 Stage Harbor Road, Chatham, 508-945-2493, chathamhistoricalsociety.org .
