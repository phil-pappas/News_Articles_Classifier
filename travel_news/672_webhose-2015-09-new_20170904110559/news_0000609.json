But it appeared poised for some rare stability after Abu Dhabi-based Etihad bought a 49% stake in the carrier last year. That was part of a broader partnership and Etihad-backed restructuring of the Alitalia that called for a fleet upgrade and a focus on long-haul routes.\nWhile that effort appears to remain on track, it will now happen under an interim CEO after Silvano Cassano relinquished that post for unspecified personal reasons, according to the airline. Cassano previously was a top executive at carmaker Fiat and clothing retailer Benetton.\nTaking over the CEO duties on an interim basis will be current Alitalia chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, whose past includes a role as the boss of sports car-maker Ferarri. Alitalia’s chief operations and financial officers will handle the carrier’s day-to-day operations.\nMedia reports mention Alitalia’s colourful past, describing its history as “littered with rescue plans, including one in 2008 sponsored by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi aimed at avoiding the carrier’s insolvency. Five years later, the Italian government had to orchestrate another rescue plan to avoid Alitalia folding.”\nCassano’s departure will raise fears that the transition is not going as smoothly as planned when Etihad took its 49% stake.\nEtihad CEO James Hogan said in January that his carrier’s equity partnership with Alitalia represented “the last chance” to save the long-struggling Italian carrier, according to thenews reports. He added Etihad’s rehab plan for Alitalia would require a “radical change in its way of working to lower costs and boost productivity.”\nAlitalia’s CEO has quit after less than a year on the job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T00:07:21.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
