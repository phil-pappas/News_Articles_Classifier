Rachel says the sound wasn't noticeable before, but now it clamours through their home every 3 or 4 minutes.\nI think if we thought the noise would go away, then we'd be OK about it. But when you think it might carry on and that there will be all night tubes coming any time soon - and also that all the tubes will run right the way through to Walthamstow, that's really quite depressing because do we want to live here anymore if that's the case?\n– Rachel Collins Credit: ITV News The Victoria line was shut for upgrade work in August to increase the line's capacity from 24 to 36 trains per hour - the track replaced between Walthamstow Central and Seven Sisters.\nTransport for London admitted the improvements made tube noise louder and, last week, said the problems would be put right within 24 hours. But one week later, they still haven't.\nCredit: ITV News We're fixing it, we've got loads of people out doing this all the time. We take this very seriously. We've ground about a kilometre of rail, we have re-railed, so we've put in new rail. We're now putting in some more new rail.\n– GEORGE MCINULTY - Programme Director of Infrastructure, TFL Quin Aranda is a writer who works from home. Like Rachel he also lives above the Victoria line - three streets and half mile further up the line. He's one of an increasing number of people to join the Noise Action Group.\nIt's really annoying, it wasn't before and now every time we are just waiting for the moment that the train is coming from the station.\n– Walthamstow Noise Action Group TfL says its working hard to mend the problems, and says it is confident in will find a solution to the noise.\nPlay video Last updated Wed 23 Sep 2015 Travel London East London", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/luketomhanrahan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"], "published": "2015-09-23T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T06:24:06.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
