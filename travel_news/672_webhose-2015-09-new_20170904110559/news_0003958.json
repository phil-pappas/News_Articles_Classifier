Unfortunately, the weather forecast was not great for the next days after my arriving... but, as the next day rain was not expected I decided to buy the tour to the PERITO MORENO GLACIER! No, it wasn't sunny with blue skies above, but, at least, it didn't rain, it was not too cold, nor windy! We could even take a boat ride to see the Glacier from very close! This picture was taken from the boat! EL CALAFATE - THE NAME OF THAT TOWN - IS A LOCAL BERRY! \"Berberis microphylla, common name Box-leaved Barberry[1] and Magellan Barberry, in Spanish Calafate, is an evergreen shrub, with simple, shiny box-like leaves. The Calafate is native to southern Argentina and Chile and is a symbol of Patagonia.\" Wikipedia 1979 posts here on TE!
