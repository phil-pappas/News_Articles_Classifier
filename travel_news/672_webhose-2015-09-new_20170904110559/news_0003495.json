(Jackie Burrell/Bay Area News Group) Related Stories Three Big Island coffee tours are must-stop, must-sips Annie's Island Fresh Burgers, Kealakekua The vibe: Whether you're dropping in at Greenwell Farms -- a block or two away -- for a coffee tour or just exploring the western side of the Big Island, head for Annie Roesler and Josh Levenson's sunny, casual, 5-year-old burger joint. Annie's celebrates local ingredients, from the Purple Potato Salad to the housemade pickles and burgers made with grass-fed, island-raised beef. A long bar serves up Hawaiian brews and cocktails, and tables are sprinkled here and there, including along a screened porch that captures the island breeze. They make salads -- with produce sourced from the organic garden out back -- seafood and sandwiches here, but burgers are Annie's well-deserved claim to fame. Half a dozen variations on the burger theme are offered up with libation-pairing suggestions, a Lavaman Red Ale to go with the BBQ South Point Burger, for example, or a malbec to complement the Bacon-Blue. The dish: The BBQ South Point ($14.50 including a side) is a glorious, four-napkin affair, dripping with tangy, spicy, Kona-style barbecue sauce and topped with melted cheddar, sliced avocados and tempura-fried onion rings. If your burger height-mouth circumference ratio is out of alignment, you may need to devour the crisp onions rings first. And no, fried onion rings and crisp basil-garlic fries are not too much fried awesomeness, but the vividly violet Purple Potato Salad side is pretty wonderful, too.
