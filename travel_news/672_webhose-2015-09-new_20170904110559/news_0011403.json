Tahiti is one of 75 destinations taking part in the relay across 60 countries, over five continents and will pass the baton to the final destination in the relay, the Cook Islands. \nTahiti Tourisme Director Australia and New Zealand Robert Thompson said the islands’ dazzling blue lagoons, picturesque beaches and vibrant culture were an Instagrammer’s dream. \n“There’s no filter necessary when you’re gazing out at Bora Bora’s blue lagoon, Tikehau’s pink sand or the Marquesas’ jagged mountain peaks, so this initiative is one we can see the whole country getting behind,” Mr Thompson said. \nAs the sun rises in Tahiti on September 27, Instagrammers from throughout the island group, including on Tahiti, Moorea and Bora Bora, will capture moments throughout the day and post them on @tahitinow. \nThe purpose of World Tourism Day in 2015 is to raise awareness of the positive and significant impact tourism has on countries and communities around the world and its potential as a force for good. \nFollow the relay @tahitinow on Instagram or simply search #helloworldRELAY.Ta \nhiti Tourisme can also be found on Twitter www.twitter.com/TahitiTourismAU and Facebook www.facebook.com/TahitiTourismAU .
