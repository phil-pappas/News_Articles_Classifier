The promotion rewards forward planners able to commit to their golf holiday plans well in advance, with a booking deadline of 31 October. Discounts are based on the chosen destination (domestic, short haul or long haul) and the number of travellers in the group. In all, the company expects that more than £500,000 of savings will be on offer.\nCash discounts are being offered to groups of five or more that plump for UK and short haul resorts and courses, while savings on long haul escapes are extended all the way down to groups of just two. The upper qualifying thresholds equate to £1,000 being slashed from a single group’s bill.\nYour Golf Travel’s co-founder, Ross Marshall, underlined the company’s determination to drive value to the consumer: “The culture of Your Golf Travel has always been built on us delivering affordable and accessible products for people that play golf. It’s pretty simple. And this is just an extension of that ethos – if our customers can commit to their 2016 plans nice and early, we’re happy to reward them with a break on their price. We’re throwing in a dozen Srixon balls for groups of 12 or more, too.”\nAdditional benefits being introduced for bookers in September and October include access to two of Your Golf Travel’s brand ambassadors – Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke. Lead travellers for groups of 24 or more heading to Europe in 2016 will be invited to attend a day with Westwood while any lucky golfer confirming their attendance experience for The 2016 Ryder Cup will join Team Europe’s Captain at an exclusive London preview event this winter.\nYour Golf Travel is the world’s largest golf travel company, carrying more than 200,000 passengers annually across 25 countries. Based in central London, it sells a range of golf travel products including attendance packages for high profile professional tournaments.\nSource: IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:27:48.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
