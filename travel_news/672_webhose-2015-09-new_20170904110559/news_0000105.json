There's a reason these great cities have prospered and others, well, haven't.\nFrom Hitler's Reich capital and Henry Ford's Amazon utopia to a floating city made up of a series of tetrahedronal structures, these are some of the most outrageous city plans ever conceived. Perhaps unsurprisingly, none came to fruition.\nScroll down for video\nRichard Buckminster Fuller's Triton City, a series tetrahedronal structures floating on the water\nTRITON CITY\nAs its hopeful creator Richard Buckminster Fuller half-rightly pointed out, 'Three-quarters of our planet Earth is covered with water, most of which may float organic cities.'\nHis ideal of a floating city, a series of tetrahedronal structures stacked up and anchored as one, didn't quite take off.\nHe was initially commissioned by a Japanese businessman to design a self-sustainable city on the water for Tokyo Bay and when he died the US government asked Fuller to develop the idea further although it was never built.\nRELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next The Eiffel Tower is just a 'lump of metal', the Pyramids can...

They are situated on the water, which they desalinate and recirculate in many usefuland non-polluting ways,' Fuller writes in Critical Path.\n'They are ships with all an ocean ship's technical autonomy, but they are also ships that will always be anchored. They don't have to go anywhere. Their shape and its human-life accommodations are not compromised, as must be the shape of the living quarters of ships whose hull shapes are constructed so that they may slip, fishlike, at high speed through the water and high seas with maximum economy.'\nThe shape was created to offer the most surface area in the least space and privacy to each resident.\nWELTHAUPTSTADT GERMANIA\nWelthauptstadt Germania: Adolf Hitler's final plan for a revamped Berlin following victory in world war two\nAdolf Hitler's plan for a revamped Berlin after victory in World War II was scuppered by the not-so-small issue of him losing\nArchitect Albert Speer was given the task of the pulling together the vision for what was officially known as 'Comprehensive Construction Plan for the Reich Capital', although Hitler toyed with the idea of naming it Germania.\nWhile some small tasks were completed, such as relocating the Berlin victory column, other ambitious projects never got started.\nO ne would have seen a massive stadium with a capacity of 400,000 built next to the Nazi parade grounds in Nuremberg - it would still dwarf any stadium in the world to this day but only the foundations were dug.\nBROADACRE CITY\nA sketch of Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City, the exact opposite of a city with the population spread out\nCars are the primary mode of transport in the non-city designed by Wright, who saw cities as societalcancers\nForget high density city living, Frank Lloyd Wright's ideal Broadacre City was all about suburban sprawl where cars have the right of way over pedestrians, except for in the smallest confines and the begrudgingly built train station.\nHe first explored the idea in his 1932 book The Disappearing City and within three years there was a scale model of the flat four square mile community on display at the Rockefeller Centre.\nWright, who continually developed the idea until his death in 1959, wanted families spread out, not living in each others pockets and believed this would solve many of society's problems.\n'To look at the plan of a great City is to look at something like the cross-section of a fibrous tumour,' Write wrote in 1945.\nEPCOT\nWalt Disney's Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT) was also known as Project X\nContinuing the trend of wealthy narcissist sharing their idea of how the world should live, Walt Disney's Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT) was also known as Project X.\nHis plan for a section of land in Orlando was to create the ideal US community and inspire corporations to come up with alternative ways to live - a long way from Mickey and Minnie.\nThe ideas were shelved on his death in 1966, and the plot was used for Walt Disney World Resort which opened in 1971.\nThe Epcot theme park became part of the resort in 1982, with nods to his original plans, while part of the original architectural model can be seen at Tomorrowland Transit Authority PeopleMover in the Magic Kingdom.\nFORDLANDIA\nAmerican car pioneer and entrepreneur, Henry Ford, attempted to establish Fordlandia in the 1920s\nFordlandia was to be a utopia of sorts in the Amazon where rubber for his cars was harvested and processed\nHenry Ford's Fordlandia was to become a utopia of sorts in the Amazon where a city would spring up around where rubber for his cars was harvested and processed\nUnfortunately for him the industrial experiment was a total failure, lasting just a few years before it was abandoned leaving thousands out of a job.\nNow the buildings are overgrown and the land that was supposed to have been built on by wealthy employers is being reclaimed by the jungle and only 1000 or so people live in the community.\nSEWARD'S SUCCESS\nSeward's Success, in Anchorage, Alaska, was touted as the world's first totally enclosed community\nA high-speed aerial runway was to transport people to and from Anchorage International Airport, and the temperature regulated by the glass of the structure\nPlans for Seward's Success, in Anchorage, Alaska, touted it as the world's first totally enclosed, climate-controlled community.\nThe $800 million project was designed by Adrian Wilson Associates of Los Angeles, it was to feature a dome enclosing 40,000 residents as well as residential, office and retail space, as well as a sports arena.\nThe temperature was to be controlled at 20C all year round, which would have been regulated by the glass of the structure, like a greenhouse.\nA high-speed aerial runway was to transport people between the community and Anchorage International Airport.\nNamed after 'Seward's Folly', an epithet to Secretary of State William H. Seward for the 1867 Alaskan Purchase . The proposal came in 1968 after the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay, but was shelved in 1972.\nRADIANT CITY\nIn 1924, idealistic French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier, developed plans for an 'ideal' city called Ville Radieuse\nIdealistic: Le Corbusier's design for his ideal city was in his mind the blueprint of social reform\nIn 1924, idealistic French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier, developed plans for an 'ideal' city called Ville Radieuse. It was, in his mind the blueprint of social reform.\nHis utopian ideas demanded that housing districts occupy the best sites in the city, all housing should have a minimum amount of solar exposure and commute times should be minimised by building industrial zones close to residential ones, with parks or sports grounds between them.\nHe also wanted to scientifically work out optimal street widths to accommodate the speed and type of transport.\nThe principles of the Ville Radieuse were incorporated into his later publication, the Athens Charter published in 1943. The design of Brasilia, the capital of Brazil was based upon the principles of the Ville radieuse.\nGARDEN CITY\nGarden Cities were intended to provide a pleasant environment while successfully employing industry and agriculture\nThe brainchild of Ebenezer Howard, the concept of Garden Cities was intended to provide a pleasant, green, environment with open public land, while simultaneously successfully employing industry and agriculture.\nThe idea was to have six cities, each connected by circular canals; straight canals would run along side roads, and each city would contain farms, an insane asylum, reservoirs, an agricultural college, industrial homes, cemeteries, and a “home for waifs”.\nSeveral garden cities were built but his vision for smokeless and dirt-free place was unsustainable.", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1LCCPFZ", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-08-27T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:31:14.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
