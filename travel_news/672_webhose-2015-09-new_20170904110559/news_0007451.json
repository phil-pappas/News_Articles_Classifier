Hampton Inn is a brand controlled by Hilton Worldwide.\nThe hotel remained open and operational despite the extensive renovations. An open house and client appreciation reception will take place at the Property in October 2015.\nMr. Rob O’Neill, Chief Executive Officer of AHIP commented, “The Hampton/Hilton PIP was designed to keep high-performing Hampton properties like the Harrisonburg University hotel at the leading edge of guest comfort and enhancing the overall guest experience. The signature exterior upgrade involved the conversion of the original roofline to a new illuminated roof cornice and upgrading the signage to the current brand standard. The Property’s fresh, contemporary look positions it to be the leading hotel within the Harrisonburg/James Madison University lodging market.”\nMr. O’Neill continued, “With the completion of this renovation, this marks the second major PIP that was successfully completed over the past few months to improve the operating performance of our branded hotels.”The renovation was completed by AHIP’s exclusive hotel manager, Tower Rock Hotels & Resorts Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of O’Neill Hotels & Resorts Ltd.\nSource:- American Hotel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:16:14.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
