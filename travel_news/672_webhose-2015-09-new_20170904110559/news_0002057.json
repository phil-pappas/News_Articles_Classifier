But a bump in the polls and an aggressive lobbying effort persuaded CNN to broaden its participation criteria, a coup for Fiorina and GOP officials eager to feature the party’s only 2016 female candidate in the nationally televised clash.\nBut don’t expect Fiorina to get as much airtime as Donald Trump, who will be positioned front and center when the candidates meet at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. The undisputed leader in national polls, Trump is generally considered the biggest reason why Fox News Channel reached 24 million people for the first GOP presidential debate last month — the most-watched program in Fox News history.\nSharing the stage with Trump and Fiorina at next week’s 8 p.m. EDT debate will be former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Russell Wilson buys $6.7 million waterfront mansion in Bellevue, report says Kam Chancellor speaks to NFL Network, says he’s willing ‘to meet the Seahawks halfway’ Empty classes, no talks as Seattle schools stalemate continues ‘Passport day’ coming up in Seattle Struggling Haggen files for bankruptcy protection, parts with Southwest co-CEO Five candidates lagging in national polls did not qualify for the main event and will be featured in a 6 p.m. debate in the same venue: former Texas Gov.

Jindal called Trump “a madman,” while Bush dismissed Trump’s latest comments as “small and inappropriate.” And Fiorina suggested she was “getting under his skin.”\nThe spark was an interview published Wednesday by Rolling Stone, in which Trump said Fiorina’s face would make her unelectable. The magazine Quote: d Trump as saying of the former technology executive: “Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?”\nBush’s advisers say he will confront Trump for not “sharing the values” of conservatives, as one put it. Fiorina, Republicans close to her say, has a more delicate balance to strike as she tries to rise above any attacks from Trump while making him look small if he unloads them.\nRubio, frustrated that the last debate did not give him many chances to talk about foreign policy, his perceived strength, will look for openings to win over Republicans who are most concerned about the nation’s security, his allies say.\nAnd Paul, who gained little from tangling with Trump and Christie in the August debate, hopes to shore up his tea-party support by talking about his plans to restrain the power of the federal government.\nMindful that 24 million people watched the August debate on Fox, the Republicans have come to see these monthly encounters as their greatest opportunity to try to break out from the 17-candidate field.\nInformation from The New York Times is included in this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:36:56.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
