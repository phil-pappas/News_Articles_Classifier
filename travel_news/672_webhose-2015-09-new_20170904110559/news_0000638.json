SeaGlass Carousel will open to the public on Thursday, August 20, 2015, at The Battery, the 25-acre public park at the southern tip of Manhattan.\nSeaGlass was conceived by the award-winning WXY Architecture + Urban Design as a carousel recalling The Battery’s history as the original home of the New York Aquarium. WXY, creators of The Battery’s contemporary architecture and furniture, then designed a spiraling pavilion of glass and steel inspired by the chambered nautilus. The magnificent fish figures – as large as 9 &frac12; feet wide and 13 &frac12; feet tall – were designed by the internationally acclaimed George Tsypin Opera Factory, which is best known for creating the Opening Ceremony for the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi.\n“It was an honor to be selected by The Battery Conservancy to run a carousel as innovative and stunning as SeaGlass,” said Ami Abramson, Ride Entertainment’s CFO. “SeaGlass is an iconic attraction in a historic location, and we look forward to operating this new major attraction for New Yorkers and visitors from around the world.”\n\"The Battery Conservancy chose an experienced operator in Ride Entertainment,” said Warrie Price, President of The Battery Conservancy. “Their leadership in the attractions industry is built on the values we seek – sustained quality of service and giving the public memories for a lifetime.\"\nVisited by over 6 million people each year, The Battery remains one of the oldest and most popular public open spaces in continuous use in New York City. The Battery Conservancy, the not-for-profit created in 1994 to rebuild and revitalize The Battery in partnership with NYC Parks & Recreation, believes SeaGlass Carousel will help further establish The Battery as a leading natural and cultural New York City destination.\n“It is a very exciting time for our Operations team,” said David Galst, Managing Director of Ride Entertainment’s Operations Division. “SeaGlass Carousel represents our 7th operation and our 5th in the New York area,” he noted.\nThe Carousel will be open daily to the public from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Admission to SeaGlass Carousel will be $5 per ride. Access to The Battery is free and open to the public.\nPictures can be found at:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/26itemmfwg3fdof/SeaGlass%20Carousel%20Imagery.zip?dl=0\nRide Entertainment runs seven parks and attractions on the Eastern Seaboard.
