Amid a cloud of sulphuric steam I can just glimpse a crisp white chef's hat bobbing around, its owner hastily manoeuvring a heavy wooden lid, then several blankets, from a box positioned over a vent in the earth. \nHe retrieves several foil containers, pops them on the back of a golf cart and disappears again into the mist. We meet a little later in a marquee overlooking Pohutu, the largest active geyser in the southern hemisphere, to eat our freshly extracted Rotorua-style hangi. \nAs far as food is concerned, Rotorua has always done things a bit differently, starting with this variation on the hangi that the local Te Arawa iwi adopted, along with the custom of putting food in a kete then boiling it in the bubbling sulphuric pools. Jason Creaghan \nSunrise at Lake Tarawera \nAt Te Puia (tepuia.com), you can sample both experiences. We devour our feast of chicken, kumara, sweetcorn, potato and cabbage, and listen to our guide discuss Rotorua's food history. \nOur visit to Te Puia is on the second day of a Rotorua culinary exploration tour, and we've already learnt that there's plenty to whet the appetite here – Rotovegas punches well above its weight in the NZ-towns-with-less-than-flattering-nicknames division (see also Hamiltron, City of the Future). \nNestled against Lake Rotorua and punctuated with sighing geysers, the city has plenty of great cafes, and on central Pukuatua St, two stand directly next to each other. Jason Creaghan \nBread Asylum and dumplings at the night markets. \nZippy Central (1153 Pukuatua St, 07-348 8288) is a Rotorua institution, and locals say it serves up the best flat whites in town, using Supreme coffee. The barista in charge is Simon Kerr, two-time Best Barista in the Rotorua Hospitality Awards, and we watch him crank out coffee after coffee while quizzing him about his favourite spots to eat – after so many wins at the hospitality awards, he's now a judge, so we take his recommendations seriously. \nNext door to Zippy is Be Rude Not To (berudenotto.co.nz), a delightfully retro cafe specialising in excellent food with an intolerance-friendly bent – most of the counter offerings are vegan, but they're so delicious you really wouldn't notice. \nTake a seat on the 70s boiled-wool orange sofa in the window and admire the murals dedicated to the Rotorua adventure tourism industry while enjoying a superlative hot chocolate. Afterwards, wander over a couple of blocks to Capers Epicurean (capers.co.nz), where you can have breakfast or shop for local honey, gluten-free products and many other specialty foods. Jason Creaghan \nLifting the hangi at Te Puia Steambox Experience. \nAround the corner under a lime green awning is Capizzi Pizzeria (capizzi.co.nz), which serves some of the best pizza we've had anywhere, and where you'll be greeted by friendly chef Deep Kumar. Kumar ended up in Rotorua because, despite being from one of the world's most populous countries (India), he doesn't like crowds. His pizzas are to be treasured – the thinnest, crispiest bases around and high-quality toppings. Ad Feedback \nYou can sit down for a meal in the dining room and be transported to a hole-in-the-wall joint in Naples, or head out back to the pleasant beer garden. And if you're in a hurry, Kumar also sells his pizza by the slice to take away, something hard enough to find in Auckland, let alone Rotorua. \nOn Thursday nights you'd be forgiven for thinking Rotorua was observing curfew, but follow the fairy lights through the abandoned streets and you'll reach the stretch of Tutanekai St where seemingly the city's entire population shows up at the night markets each week (facebook.com/rotoruanightmarket). Jason Creaghan \nBe Rude Not To cafe. \nThe range of stalls rivals any other night market in the country, with everything from local fruit and veg (the queue is the length of the block) to burritos, Matariki lantern-making, Chinese dumplings and paella. The local Ciabatta Bakery is here too, selling many excellent baked goods including the \"world's longest hot dog\", served on a 43cm ciabatta bun. \nPulling ourselves away from the tempting market offerings is made slightly easier by the promise of a visit to a locals' secret – Sabroso (sabroso.co.nz), a South American-style restaurant run by Sarah Little and her husband John. \nLittle was born in Venezuela, then moved to the US for work. What brought her to New Zealand? \"Bush got re-elected and we needed a lifestyle change.\" Jason Creaghan \nDining room of Capizzi. \nThe menu's full of delicious South American-inspired offerings, given Little's own signature spin. We begin with the rollos sabroso – fried tortillas stuffed with black beans, spinach and salsa – followed by the night's special, confit duck tostados with lashings of lime. \nThere are also house-made hot sauces on every table – a warning on the side of the bottle counsels against using it as a bomb accelerant. Mention Sabroso to anyone in town and their eyes will light up at the thought of one of Little's margaritas. \nA couple of blocks towards Lake Rotorua is Eat Streat (rotoruanz.com/eatstreat), Rotorua's dining precinct. Ingeniously, thermal heating pumps underfoot along the street to warm your toes in the colder months. Jason Creaghan \nSarah Little and husband John of Sabroso. \nA newcomer to the precinct is Leonardo's Pure Italian (facebook.com/LeonardosPureItalian), a Rotorua institution that recently moved to much bigger premises on Eat Streat. Here, I manage to squeeze in a serving of Leonardo's famous tiramisu. \nNext, we head for Brew (brewpub.co.nz), the headquarters of the award-winning Croucher Brewing Co, which is packed with locals on a Thursday evening. We sit beneath a mural illustrating the beer-brewing process while deciding on the perfect tasting paddle – as well as Croucher's portfolio, there are beers available from brewers throughout the country. \nIf we weren't already replete with Latin American fare, this would be an ideal place to settle in for the evening with a plate of Cajun fried chicken and more great beer. Jason Creaghan \nAlex Burge of Ciabatta Bakery. \nHowever, duty calls, and continuing the bar crawl we head next door to Ponsonby Rd (ponsonbyrd.co.nz), a cocktail bar opened earlier this year by Tamati Coffey and partner Tim Smith. Aiming to bring a bit of Ponsonby cool to Eat Streat, it's a red-velvet-curtain-lined moody, glam space with an extensive cocktail list and lounge music four nights a week. We settle into a couple of red velvet chairs, sip on a Ponsonby Kwencher cocktail and reflect on a day well spent eating. \nRising early the next morning, we're rewarded with stunning views of the sun rising at Lake Tarawera. If you fancy a visit at a more civilised time of day, the Landing Cafe (taraweralanding.co.nz) sits right on the water's edge, and boasts fantastic views up the length of the lake. \nFollowing a local tip, we stop on the way back to town at Mistress of Cakes (mistressofcakes.co.nz) for a piece of fabulous white choc raspberry slice. Aaron McLean \nSpring Cover, Cuisine magazine \nNext, we pull off the main road in search of local gem Ciabatta Bakery (ciabattabakery.co.nz), run by Swiss import Alex Burge and wife Sue. Having established themselves in Rotorua as a wholesale bakery (run out of their backyard, with Sue doing the deliveries), Burge set up the cafe for a bit of a change of pace. \nSince then though, the pair have given up the wholesale side of their business to focus on the cafe full-time. The evidence of Burge's active imagination is everywhere – he made almost every bit of furniture in the place himself, including the workshop table in the shape of the North Island. Having trained as a patisserie chef in Switzerland, Burge has long since mastered the classics, and these days likes to focus on more quirky offerings. \nWhen he was looking for something to sell at the night markets, he hit on the idea of the aforementioned world's longest hot dogs. Are they really? \"I've done some research,\" he says. When a CrossFit gym opened next door, he turned his mind to paleo options, and now his \"paleoccino\" has a cult following. However eccentric his creations, from go-nuts (his take on the cronut) to banoffee coffee (several tradies stopped in during the course of our conversation to order these), Burge does them to the best of his ability. \n\"It's like drawing,\" he says. \"Some people are happy to stay with stick figures. We're not in the business of stick figures here.\" The 43cm hot dog is engineered with a thinner bun and lighter mayonnaise, so that despite its size, \"you don't feel disgusting when you finish\". Burge's enthusiasm is infectious, and he \nholds regular workshops around the table in the room next door (\"the shape of the North Island is very conducive to conversation\"). \nWhile a walk around the lake is a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon and work off some of your eating, the best way to appreciate the landscape of Rotorua is from about 200m up the side of Mt Ngongotaha. Volcanic Hills winery opened in 2009 (volcanichills.co.nz) and sits at the base of the mountain. \nAfter it's been bottled, the wine itself makes the scenic journey up the Skyline gondola to the tasting room at the top, in the old gondola station. Take a seat on the old chesterfield with a cheeseboard and let winemakers Sean Beer or Brent Park take you through a pleasingly friendly and informative tasting. \nThe men met while working for large wineries, both in New Zealand and internationally, and their grapes are sourced from some of the oldest vines in the country's best wine regions. \nSo why base the winery in Rotorua? \n\"Why not?\" Beer laughs. \nIf you've worked up an appetite for dinner (trip down the luge optional), head next door to the newly renovated Stratosfare (skyline.co.nz/rotorua). You'll be rewarded with those same stunning views along with a sleek interior and numerous options to take your fancy at the smart buffet. \nThe restaurant cleaned up at the recent Rotorua Hospitality Awards (including Best Waiter for my lovely waiter Te Aroha), and pretty much anything you might feel like is on offer – highlights include a dumpling bar, and Mangatu Gisborne wagyu beef, aged on site. \nHeading out of town the next day, we still have a couple of key food stops to make – first at Patrick's Gold Star Bakery (89 Old Taupo Rd, 07-349 1959), the bakehouse home of Patrick Lam's award-winning pies (the shelves above the cash register positively heave with his trophies). \nEgg and bacon pie in hand, we continue north-east, sights set on the Okere Falls Store (okerefallsstore.co.nz). Hosting a Beer Fest each October (they even make their own souvenir steins), the store sells everything from fresh local produce to Spanish delicacies and craft beer (you can find the same goodies in the sister store back in town, attached to the Rotorua library). \nMany things have traditionally put Rotorua on the map, from the hot pools, luge and gondola to the famous Polynesian Spa and the Redwood Forest on the outskirts of town – it's rewarding to discover that there's also a strong local food scene.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:16:17.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
