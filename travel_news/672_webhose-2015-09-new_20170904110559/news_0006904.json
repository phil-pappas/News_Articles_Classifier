It has been declared that its October edition will be its last.\nWhile there has been speculation for some time that Zoo Weekly has suffered low sales, it is a victory that Collective Shout, Australia’s most vocal anti-porn campaigners, is claiming as its own.\nIn August 2015, Zoo Weekly was removed from Coles’ shelves after a “successful online campaign” was waged by Collective Shout. The basis for this campaign was that Zoo Weekly was, in effect, a “misogynistic, all-ages porn mag”.\nIt was argued “sexual objectification of women [was] Zoo Weekly’s core business.” It was stated that Zoo Weekly “promotes rape culture.”\nWhile Collective Shout will have you believe that the reason for their campaign was because of a poorly worded article that was published by the UK’s Zoo Weekly, history has shown that Collective Shout’s real problem lies with the idea of women displaying their bodies in men’s magazines.\nFirstly, the problem with claiming that women have been sexually objectified by this magazine is the fact that women, who have appeared in this, and other “lad’s mags”, have done so consensually.\nThe women who appear in these magazines, often dressed in string bikinis, have done so consensually and have been paid for their work.\nAs far as I am aware, there have been no instances where Zoo Weekly has placed a woman on their cover without that woman’s approval.\nAshlee Adams on the cover of Zoo Weekly. Source: Supplied\nAshlee Adams is an Australian model and DJ now living in Los Angeles. She has graced the covers of Zoo Weekly on multiple occasions and is shocked by yesterday’s news.\n“I think that occasionally some of the dialogue in Zoo may have been pushing the inappropriate envelope, but to suggest that women are promoting rape culture by posing in a silly bikini rolling around on some couch laughing with some Xbox controller is ludicrous.\n“I consider myself a feminist but for me, feminism is about taking control of our bodies and our sexuality and doing what we want with it.”\nUnder the guise of seeking “corporate social responsibility” from these magazines, Collective Shout is effectively shutting down the ability for women to show their sexuality in a way that they choose and in a way that they are comfortable.\nIn the enthusiastic desire to protect the world from hyper-sexualisation, groups like Collective Shout are unanimously shutting down sexual expression of those who do not fit within their definition of “acceptable behaviour”.\nOn one hand, they are claiming to “speak for women”. But on the other, they are refusing to listen to the voices of women who choose to express their sexuality — like those models appearing on the cover of Zoo Weekly.\nCollective Shout’s Campaign Manager Caitlyn Roper once claimed that “silencing women’s voices is the straightforward aim of online misogyny.” It has become apparent today though that Collective Shout is happy to contribute to that online misogyny by silencing bikini models.\nBy attacking the diversity of the media (print or otherwise), organisations such as Collective Shout are directly attacking the freedom of speech and the freedom of sexual expression.\nTo use the excuse of “corporate social responsibility” is exactly that — an excuse.\nIt is important to note that the co-founder of Collective Shout Melinda Tankard Reist identifies herself as a conservative Christian, who is not only anti-abortion (or ‘pro-life’) but was also a staff member of the late Tasmanian senator Brian Harradine.\nPhoto: @darthlux. Source: Instagram\nIt is important to remember that Mr. Harradine was once described as “the Great Tasmanian Catholic Warrior.” This is not the first time that members of the Australian Christian Lobby have dictated how women conduct themselves sexually.\nJust recently, the New South Wales Brothel Inquiry heard over four hours of submissions by the Australian Christian Lobby on how sex work should be regulated.\nLucie Bee, sex worker and porn performer, says “the nomenclature doesn’t sit well with all of us, but women openly discussing their sexuality and what works for them inside and outside the bedroom, in publications intended for men is important.\n“Women appearing as strong, decisive and sexual, capable of making their own decisions, taking the reins sexually, as opposed to just passively having things done to them — is important.”\nWith respect to the role Collective Shout has played in “fighting the sexualisation of women”, Lucie Bee is concerned with the limited scope of their advocacy.\nShe says “they haven’t spoken at any great length about the damaging effects of the beautify industry, largely pushed by women’s magazines, on women’s body confidence or self-image and this frankly concerns me.”\nThe result of Collective Shout’s aim to stop women from choosing to use their bodies for financial gain on this occasion has been successful.\nWe will wait with bated breath to see whether they turn their attention to Cosmopolitan, Marie Claire and other beauty magazines.\nKathryn Adams is a lawyer specialising in human rights and sex work issues, as well as an advocate for the decriminalisation of sex work throughout the world.
