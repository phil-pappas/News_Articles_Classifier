Her wax figure can now be found at the attraction’s “Historical and National Heroes” themed area, along with the wax figures of various world leaders and historical heroes.\nPeng is not only known for her accomplishments as a soprano and top-tier performing artist; she is also deeply committed to numerous charitable causes. In 2011, she was appointed World Health Organisation Goodwill Ambassador for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. In tribute to Peng’s philanthropic contributions, approachable personality and elegant sense of style, all of which are well-loved by the public and media alike, Madame Tussauds Hong Kong decided to produce the world’s first wax likeness of her, enabling fans from around the world to “meet” her up-close.\nTo ensure the wax figure would be made to perfection, the Madame Tussauds sculpting team studied hundreds of reference photos of Peng and spent a total of six months to create the first wax figure of “the First Lady of China”. Truly exemplifying Peng’s elegant and contemporary sense of style, the wax figure wears an elegant blue wrap dress.\nThe wax figure of another popular Korean celebrity, Lee Jong-suk, will take up residence at K-wave Zone by early next year. Lee originally debuted as a fashion model at the young age of 16 years old, making him the youngest and most talked-about male model to debut at Seoul Collection. In 2010, he starred in the television dramas Prosecutor Princess and Secret Garden, during which his tall and handsome appearance started to gain attention. In 2013-14, he played lead roles in I Can Hear Your Voice and Pinocchio, which brought him numerous acclaims including Grime Award’s youngest-ever Best Male Actor.\nThe Madame Tussauds sculpting team conducted a seven-hour sitting process with Lee Jong-suk earlier. In spite of the lengthy process, Lee showed his professionalism as a top model by offering different poses for measurement and enlivened the entire process with his sense of humour. Lee revealed that his wax figure will wear a shocking pink suit — guaranteed to show off his perfect physique and widen the eyes of his fans — with a “V sign” hand gesture to symbolise peace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:14:13.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
