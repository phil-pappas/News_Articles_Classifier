Corporate card is the way to go and if there is a TMC that asks to pay by invoice then beware.”\nThe session was part of a half-day event in association with ACTE which explored how buyers can optimise your risk strategy in a changing environment. It was aimed at buyers with speakers from TMCs, security firms and financial services firms.\nClaudia Unger, director of research and intelligence, BCD Travel said: “Virtual cards are great for a company who are paying for third party travellers such as freelancers and consultants.”\nBBT Forum Dublin took place on August 23 at The Gibson Hotel, Dublin. The next forum will be held in London on October 2 and there are still limited spaces for buyers.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "http://events.panaceapublishing.com/bbtforumlondon"], "published": "2015-09-24T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:05:05.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
