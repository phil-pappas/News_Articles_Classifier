As the boredom sets in, sights along the route trigger emotions that make the mind ponder, wander and dig up memories. And sometimes the most banal things keep you ticking over. While individual inner monologue may vary, here is a selection of what goes through my mind when I'm trapped behind the wheel... The long and winding road... but did I leave the stove on? Photo: Getty If I hear that song on the radio once more I think I'll go crazy. Did I lock the back door? I wonder if England will bowl the Aussies out before lunch. Who actually has one of those Baby On Board stickers on their cars? Why do I have the feeling I left the stove on this morning? Surely I'd have heard by now if the house had burnt down. Being a taxi driver can't be such a hard job. Uh-oh, I think I just missed the exit... That's a huge Waitrose lorry. Hmm, what shall I have for dinner tonight? Do I go healthy or delicious? Salmon and veg? Frozen pizza? Don't only 50 per cent of speed cameras actually contain film? You'd think they'd all be digital by now. I hope that was one of those ghost cameras... Ah, a sign to Reading. I remember the festival when Nirvana headlined after The Levellers. That makes me feel very old. Twenty-five miles to Aldeburgh. Now that's my kind of festival. The new James Bond film had better be good. Who will replace Daniel Craig? I always thought Clive Owen would make a good 007. To be fair, I reckon I could do a half-decent job given the chance. Except for the coming-out-of-the-sea scene. Did I remember my passport? Why are continental service stations so much better than back in the UK? Those fancy paninis are all very well but sometimes I just crave a motorway Big Mac. Look, there's a sign to Bédoin. Isn't that where the Mont Ventoux climb starts for the Tour de France? That Fiesta reminds me of my first ever car. Ah, what times we spent together... I'm sure we listened to this Harry Potter audio book last summer. Should I grow a beard like Jeremy Corbyn or is facial hair a bit passé now? Right, I need coffee. Are we nearly there yet? • No matter what thoughts go through your head on the road, worrying about a breakdown shouldn't be one of them.
