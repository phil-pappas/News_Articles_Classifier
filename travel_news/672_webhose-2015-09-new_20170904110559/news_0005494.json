I had hit the highest note; if I were a comedienne, I would’ve walked off-stage, but I wasn’t, so I couldn’t. I knew what I was there for, as best man: adroitly fill out a suit, be a warm body next to the groom at the ceremony, and--most importantly--give a fantastic speech at the reception. I don’t have many talents, but one thing I can do is write and deliver a speech with alacrity. I don’t want to sound self-aggrandizing, but I executed that speech with the aplomb of one of those old, admirable, legendary British thespians of stage and screen--the likes of Laurence Olivier, Anthony Hopkins, Peter O’Toole, Richard Burton, etc. I got in everything I wanted to say, and did so exactly the way I wanted to say it. The audience laughed in all the right places, the funniest punchline got an uproarious laugh than went on so long I had to pause and take a drink before moving on, they were nodding as I made universal points, and were generally at rapt attention. Believe me, there is no better feeling in this world than an audience going wherever you lead them, putty in your hands, eating it up with a spoon, as you give a speech. It’s a rush. The bride and groom, Kathryn and Chris Dankert, were effusive in their praise afterward, as was everyone else, including their parents--the groom’s mother was in tears--members of the wedding party, and other guests. Even the photographer told the bride she’s photographed a lot of weddings, and she was hard-pressed to recall a speech as polished and distinguished. As for the rest of the weekend, well... Let’s start with the location. The cabins we inner-circle guests stayed at, which were on the same site as the ceremony and reception, were truly past the edge of civilization--no TV or internet! Being that isolated is enough to send me into a fit of nervous tics. Right on the bay and nestled in the dense forests of northeast Wisconsin, it was incredibly remote--I felt like Anthony Hopkins in that movie “The Edge,” flying into the Alaskan wilderness. Believe me, if the Unabomber had hid here instead of where he did, the authorities never would’ve found him. This was the type of hideaway Hollywood starlets pick to marry at if they want to ensure the press won’t be able to follow them. At roughly 5 p.m. August 28, I walked slightly off property to make a phone call and alighted upon an eight-point buck munching vegetation roughly 30 yards away. We stared at one another for a few moments, but then I withdrew, not wanting to interrupt his dinner. He even swished his tail a bit, clearly and correctly unafraid of the wobbly man in the sportcoat.
