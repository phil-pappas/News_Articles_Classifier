Assured that \"If you can ride Verbier, you can ride anywhere\" by a friend who's been riding in the Alps for as long as he can remember, this year's destination practically picked itself: Verbier, Switzerland, a less than two-hour drive southeast of Geneva. \nThe main resort in Switzerland's largest ski area Quatres Vallées, Verbier is nestled in a high-alpine bowl 1,500m above sea level, which is also the gateway to \"Bike Park Verbier\", a trail network with seven marked downhill tracks, a combined 213km of all-mountain trails and countless natural (unmarked) trails. Trailheads are accessed with gondolas and chairlifts fitted with bike racks and it all operates like clockwork -- this is Switzerland after all. \nFifteen years on from launching \"Bike Park Verbier\", hosts and guides Phil and Lucy have perfected the formula for the ultimate mountain biking holiday and it shows in the number of returning riders -- nearly everyone else during our stay was a Verbier veteran. Their trail knowledge is phenomenal and stretches far beyond the riding in and around Verbier. Accommodation is in a comfortable chalet, and a hearty breakfast and scrumptious dinner begins and ends each day's riding. It's also the perfect place to unwind. \nSince we were newcomers, we headed out to the bike park on our first day, Sunday. The entire region had been subjected to heavy downpours just before our arrival, and although bike park tracks tend to hold up reasonably well in adverse weather, the natural trails had become a little more interesting. \n\"This one might be a bit slippery,\" quickly became our guide's catchphrase of the day and he wasn't kidding. Inevitably, a number of involuntary dismounts provided some comedy moments throughout the day. The weather still wasn't very co-operative, but now suitably warmed up (thanks to the extra layers we bought during an emergency shopping break), we felt ready. \nDay two saw us all joining up for some further exploring higher up and further away. A string of gondolas and lifts linked together with high speed descents eventually delivered us on the Col des Gentianes (2,950m), covered under a blanket of snow. The ride down to Siviez was long and flowy with the odd surprise thrown in, none more so than the 1m drop that appeared out of nowhere and very nearly sent me flying over the handlebars (the wooden down-ramp had been removed!). Another lift took us back up to 2,200m for the afternoon's descent: from sweeping alpine treeless terrain with 360-degree views, down into the woods where we wound our way around endless switchbacks, some of them still frustratingly too tight for my riding skills despite plenty of practice. The trail finally spat us out on the outskirts of Sion, where our van was waiting to whisk us back to base. An awesome day. \nOn the next day, we ventured out even further. The van shuttled us to the Crans-Montana ski area northeast of Verbier, where we hopped on a cable car to Les Violettes (2,200m). A lung-busting pedal up a loose gravelly trail, in parts too steep to ride, and then a narrow ribbon of single-track cutting through the meadows, brought us to a peaceful lunch spot looking out -- at least during the brief spells that the dense fog temporarily lifted -- at a distant waterfall. \nWith 2,000m of downhill between us and the traditional post-ride cake, we lowered our saddles, zipped up our wind-proof jackets and ripped down the barren landscape, past the now roaring waterfall, through the lush green fields and into the pine forest. A potent cocktail of loam, pine needles and tricky roots had me holding on for dear life there, although a few steep punchy climbs provided welcome relief for my increasingly numb braking fingers. A 20 minute climb up a fire road and a long stretch of unusually flat single-track next to a meandering little stream neatly divided the descent into three sections. With the final stretch featuring slate and rocks of all sizes, we'd pretty much covered all types of terrain in a single descent. \nOn our rest day and with a vastly improved weather forecast for the rest of the week, we kept the riding limited to a muddy morning in the bike park. We also worked out an alternative way back to the chalet -- we weren't lost, honestly. \nThe next day, we opted to stay local once more since there were plenty of local trails we hadn't sampled yet. The decision was maybe also helped by the alternative ride on offer: it involved a lengthy climb followed by an hour hike-a-bike. I didn't need any arm-twisting. We revisited some of the trails we rode on our first day, but now the skies were blue and we no longer had to imagine the dramatic Sun-drenched panoramas concealed by the clouds. Colourful paragliders circled overhead while we had lunch on a scenic ridge overlooking the valley: the Alps at their best. The very best was kept for last though: the late afternoon home run down an old abandoned cobblestoned mountain road. It's a real bone-shaker -- and a spoke-snapper, I later discovered -- but wicked fun. \nTime flies and on Friday, our last day of riding, the van shuttled us up for four thrilling descents. From the \"Gladiator\" trail, I fondly recall the long gnarly rock garden, the next track with a not-fit-for-print name was some of the fastest single-track on record, and the final downhill run conveniently terminated at a café near the chalet. A fitting way to end the week. \nTalking to the other riders around the bonfire on the last night, it became clear that we'd barely scratched the surface of the riding out there, and with the banter slowing down and weariness setting in, I caught myself staring into the flames and plotting a return trip. If anything, I have unfinished business with a few switchbacks out there. Joris Laperre is a Belgian mountain biker based in Bangkok.
