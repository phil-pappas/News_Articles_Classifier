(Photos by Wikimedia Commons) - + DCA confident airlines can fix 'minor' flaws City Airways, a Thai-registered charter airline, appears set to spread its wings after last year's corporate restructuring that put it under Chinese management. \nUshering in a new era for City Airways was the conclusion of an accord last week to acquire 20 jets made by the state-run Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd (Comac). \nThe memorandum of understanding, struck at the Beijing Aviation Expo, calls for City Airways to lease 10 C919 single-aisle jets and another 10 ARJ21-700 regional jets from the Chinese aircraft leasing company ICBC, which purchases the jets from Comac. \nThe terms involved were not disclosed but the CA-ICBC deal was said to be instrumental to the airline's future expansion, which accentuates its core operation between Thailand and China, on new routes with neighbouring countries as well as Thai domestic flights. \nCity Airways, which operates four ageing Boeing 737 jets on some domestic routes and charter flights to China, expects to obtain the first ARJ21-700, with 78-90 seats, in June 2017. \nThe Comac C919 made its maiden flight earlier this year, but it will not be available for commercial airlines before next year at the earliest. Comac hopes the narrow-body, twin-engined jetliner, which will be China's only home-grown commercial jet, will rival the Airbus A320 and the 737 jets from Boeing. \nState-owned aircraft maker Comac announced in July the C919 programme was delayed \"because assembly was taking longer than expected\". \nAviation Week magazine reported from the Paris Air Show in July that \"industry officials\" believe that achieving a 2018 first delivery will be challenging for the plane. \nCFM International delivered the first LEAP-1C engine to Commercial Aircraft Corp in mid-July, for installation on the first C919. CFM International is a joint venture by the US firm GE Aviation, a division of General Electric, and by Snecma, a division of Safran of France. \nAccording to the graphic below, published by Chinese media and translated by the JEC Group, most of the aircraft's parts are sourced from abroad, and the C919 is assembled in China. \nComac also has not given a delivery date for the following ARJ21-700. \nChinese media reports said Comac intends to roll out the first 150-seat C919 and test flights this year and the results will enable the firm to set the delivery times. \nHowever, the smaller ARJ21-700 was officially certified by the Civil Aviation Administration of China at the end of last year, clearing the production path for Comac. \nCity Airways chairman Yan Zexin told Chinese media that the China-made aircraft is ideally suited for the airline's expansion and tackled problems related to early delivery slots if the company was to order aircraft from Airbus or Boeing. \nCity Airways would be among the first airlines in Asia to operate the Chinese-made aeroplanes, whose bargain prices compared to western-built ones are the major draw. \nThe accord with City Airways raises the total orders for C919s and ARJ21-700s to 514 and more than 300, respectively. \nFounded in 2011, City Airways was originally owned by a group of Thai, Chinese and Hong Kong tour firms. \nThere was a corporate shakeup with a new shareholding structure a year ago, a step which was reported to have turned business around. \nNOTE : A versoin of this story appeared in Monday's printed edition of Business Post .
