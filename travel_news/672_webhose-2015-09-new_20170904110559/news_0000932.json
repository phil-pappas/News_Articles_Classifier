My father, Gregory, and my uncle, Patrick, were captivated by the continent. They grew up living with lion, leopard, rhino and a multitude of other African animal trophies in their Key West home and listening to stories about the East African hunting safari that their parents made in 1933-1934—the very one my grandfather Ernest immortalized in “Green Hills of Africa.”\nSo perhaps it isn’t surprising that I was also fascinated with Africa from an early age. But for me, unlike my forebears, the appeal was not hunting big game: It was the idea of traveling to a beautiful land full of strange wildlife.\nRelated Into Canoeing? Try It on an African River Safari How to Take Children on an African Safari A Zambian Walking Safari: the Ultimate Wildlife Adventure WSJ. Magazine: andBeyond’s CEO Joss Kent on the Luxury Safari Industry My first experience of Africa was in 1974 as a boy on a family safari in Tanzania , and it whet my appetite for more. Two more trips, through Botswana , Zimbabwe and South Africa, further fueled my obsession. In the winter of 1995, I was living in Athens, Greece, working toward my Ph.D. in classical archaeology but uncertain whether I could make a living in that field, given the paucity of jobs and the intense competition for them. It seemed the right moment to test an alternate career path, so I managed to secure a summer job leading safaris in Zambia’s South Luangwa Valley —on the condition that I complete several weeks of training.\nMy adventure began just after I arrived in Zambia, when I boarded a single-propeller Cessna in Lusaka bound for the remote settlement of Mfuwe. Sitting next to the pilot as we flew at low altitude, I had a perfect perch from which to survey the seemingly endless plains dotted with Acacia trees and mopane woodland.\nThe Luangwa Valley lies at the southern end of Africa’s Great Rift. It is one of the continent’s last great wilderness preserves, as remarkable for its wildlife as for its remote, unspoiled nature. The man I’d come to work for, Norman Carr, was more than 80 years old. He’d first arrived in the Luangwa Valley in 1939 and was best known for his wildlife books and for having raised two lion cubs to maturity. A sage and a superstar of the bush who spearheaded the creation of Zambia’s national parks and worked to protect the rhino, he was also a gifted teacher—equal to the best of my Classics professors. Norman took me under his wing and taught me about conservation, ecology, local history and the safari guide’s code of conduct, among other things. My classroom was the shade outside his private hut where we were surrounded by all that he was teaching me. During one of our sessions, I watched as a spotted bush snake charmed a tree frog and swallowed it whole right next to Norman’s chair. At night I had to be careful not to disturb hippos who had wandered up from the river in search of food.\nAfter six weeks of preparation, I passed my guide’s exams and was able to take clients on safaris in the park. My days were spent with curious, camera-wielding travelers, searching for and observing wildlife up close, both in a vehicle and on foot. I remember following an aardvark returning to its lair at dawn, and watching a groggy pride of lions rouse themselves at dusk and fan out across a golden field of tall grass to hunt antelope. I remember coming upon a leopard stalking prey in the night and an elephant daintily picking and eating berries no larger than a chokecherry one at a time from a tree. My most memorable encounter was in the bedroom of my mud-brick, thatch-roofed hut one moonlit night. I awoke from a deep sleep to the sound of a low-pitched rumble that must have been coming from the belly of the large cow elephant feeding on the chili bushes just outside my open window. She was no more than 3 feet away from me and I watched her silently for several moments, awe-struck at this creature bathed in silvery moonlight. Then our eyes met—she flapped her giant ears and let out a loud trumpet that sent me scurrying to the far end of my bed, where I felt trapped like a bug in my mosquito netting. I feared she would charge right through the mud wall and trample me to death, but she turned on a dime and ran off into the night.\n‘ I feared the elephant would charge through the wall and trample me to death. ’\nWeeks later, my fiancée called to tell me that I had been offered an internship at the Harvard Art Museums to work on a show of ancient Greek bronze statuary. I stayed up late into the night celebrating with friends I had made in Zambia. We rode motorbikes out under the stars to a nearby saltpan, where I could see the Southern Cross constellation dipping beneath the horizon. I opened up the bike’s motor and drove straight out across the flat expanse, closing my eyes and feeling the wind against my face. Making a life in Africa was not to be my path, but living close to the land had opened my eyes to the natural world. I left Africa understanding that every creature on this planet has its purpose, and comforted to know that I was still figuring out mine.\nENLARGE Seán Hemingway —Seán Hemingway is a curator of Greek and Roman Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
