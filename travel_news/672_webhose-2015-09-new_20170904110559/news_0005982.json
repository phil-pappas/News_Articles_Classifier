Currently there are nine golf courses within 20 minutes of the Medina of Marrakech. It truly is an Amazing City with Brilliant Golf.\n \nOrigin Hotels has developed the website MarrakechGolfer.com with the sole objective of attracting golfers to Marrakech. More and more golfers are looking for different places, unique experiences and fantastic golf. Marrakech has it all. The website allows the golfer to study the scorecards, look at the images, imagine their next exotic golf vacation and start creating a bespoke package.\n \nSeven years ago, Robert Hlawatsch, a Stockholm resident bought his first Riad.

The number of golfers staying at an Origin hotel is growing too. Origin loves golf and Marrakech. That’s a good combination!\n \nImagine waking up as the sun rises with the distant sound of the call to prayer. Relax in one of the courtyards sipping coffee and eating local pastries, whilst the hotel whisks your clubs to the course. Play on a Jack Nicklaus or Kyle Philips course with the best facilities, before heading back to enjoy a beer on the roof terrace ahead of exploring the souks in the evening.\n \nMarrakechGolfers.com experts are located across Europe, so they understand what every golfer needs. Origin Hotels takes care of everything on-site from airport pick-up to tee times, and from traditional welcome dinners to tours of the souks.
