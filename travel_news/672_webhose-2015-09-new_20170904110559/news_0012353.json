Worth Avenue Yachts is also appointed as the Central Agent for \"Jetsetter,\" the first Dynamiq yacht under construction. Worth Avenue Yachts and Dynamiq will exhibit together at the Monaco Yacht Show next month. This will be the pioneering yacht builder's inaugural appearance at a yacht show.\nDynamiq's unique series', customized via its online configurator, are a first for the industry. Clients can select every aspect of the design of their yacht, from the exterior paint scheme to the interior finish, on the company's site at www.bedynamiq.com . The configurator features full pricing and delivery date for every element; the transparency of which will revolutionize the way superyachts are specified and delivered.\nDynamiq was launched in June 2015 at the exclusive Yacht Club de Monaco, where they presented their innovative category of superyacht grand touring vessels for long-distance journeys in top comfort and style.\nThe reasoning behind Dynamiq's choice of Worth Avenue Yachts as the official sales representative is Worth's reputation for selling clients' yachts of over 120ft in length almost three times faster than the market average. Dynamiq's American Representative at Worth Avenue Yachts' Palm Beach office is Connor Cogan. Hein Velema, Sales Broker at Worth Avenue Yachts' Monaco office, will be Central Agent for \"Jetsetter,\" the first yacht under construction at Dynamiq.\nDynamiq's new series \"GTT, Gran Turismo Transatlantic\" is a category of superyacht based on the GT car philosophy. It combines the comfort and range of displacement vessels, with the performance and style of sport cruisers.\nDynamiq yachts offer top speeds up to 25 knots knots, so they can travel from Monaco to Saint Tropez in 2 hours, or can make the trip from Miami to the Galapagos on one tank of fuel. A shallow draft of less than 6 feet (1.75 meters) also makes Dynamiq yachts 'Bahamas friendly' and gives much more cruising freedom.\nThe Dynamiq GTT is available in three base models:\n- the D4 base model, 127ft / 38.6m, 2o knots, starts at EUR13,900,000\n- the S4 sport version, 127ft / 38.6m, 25 knots, starts at EUR15,500,00\n- and the D4 L limousine version 132ft / 40m, 20 knots, starts at EUR14,750,000\nAll three models are built in aluminum, to the highest standards of comfort, safety and emission control. Four or five guest cabin arrangements are available with crew quarters for six crewmembers. The D4 yacht has the largest sundeck of her class.\nIn 2014 the keel of \"Jetsetter\" the first Dynamiq D4 yacht was laid at NCA shipyard in Carrara, Italy. The yacht is scheduled to be delivered in September 2016 and will be on display at the Monaco Yacht Show 2016.\nSince its launch in 2011, Worth Avenue Yachts has quickly emerged as a leading luxury yacht brokerage, specializing in yacht sales, yacht charters and new yacht construction.\nFor more information on Worth Avenue Yachts visit www.WorthAvenueYachts.com\nIf you would like hi-res images or any further information about Worth Avenue Yachts, please contact:\nDanielle Giordano, Marketing Manager, Worth Avenue Yachts\nEmail: Danielle@WorthAvenueYachts.com\nFort Lauderdale Office Tel: +1 (954) 703-5737\nPalm Beach Office Tel: +1 (561) 833 4462\nMonaco Office Tel: +377 977 767 57\n release/worth-avenue-yachts-announces-collaboration-with-revolutionary-new-superyacht-builder-dynamiq-412024.php", "external_links": ["http://bedynamiq.com/", "http://www.worthavenueyachts.com/", "http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/", "http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/press-release/worth-avenue-yachts-announces-collaboration-with-revolutionary-new-superyacht-builder-dynamiq-412024.php"], "published": "2015-09-01T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T12:15:12.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
