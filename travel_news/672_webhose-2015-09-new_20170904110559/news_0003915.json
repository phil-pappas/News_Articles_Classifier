Sixteen years ago Australia lifted the Webb Ellis Cup with the starting XV having amassed 622 caps (41.5 on average), and in 2011 New Zealand succeeded on home soil with that figure reaching a high-water mark of 709 collectively (47.3). With All Blacks’ five first-choice starters – Richie McCaw (142), Dan Carter (106), Conrad Smith (88), Tony Woodcock (115) and Keven Mealamu (126) – totalling a staggering 577 caps between them on the eve of RWC 2015, if the favourites manage to defend their title, then that bar will be raised once more. Yes, rugby is becoming a young man’s sport, yet the All Blacks appear to have realised that their older, gnarled players balance out a lack of sharpness with their speed of anticipation and split-second decision making. And when it comes to the crunch that knowledge of where runners will be outside you, which over time becomes second nature, could make those marginal gains needed for victory all the more attainable. Stuart Lancaster’s England, whose side to face Fiji in the opening game of the tournament have won 444 caps (29.6 on average), have been accused of not have enough experience to power to glory at Twickenham on 31 October. But do all those caps really matter all that much, especially if the players have featured together at age-grade level, well before they made their full international debuts? The All Blacks' older, gnarled players balance out a lack of sharpness with their speed of anticipation and split-second decision making Indeed, analysing Lancaster’s 31-man campaign squad, one notices that all but three of the players had not played at youth standard for England; that is at under-16, 18, 19 or 20 level. In the case of Tom Youngs, the centre-turned-hooker, he has featured at all four of those stages. Further, two of the squad could not have played for England at those ages. Durban-born Brad Barritt (who, incidentally, played for South African in the 2006 Under 21 Rugby World Championship) moved over to Saracens from Natal Sharks at the age of 21 in 2008, while Sam Burgess, 26, only moved across from rugby league last summer. Scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth is the only player among Lancaster’s chosen ones to have never featured in an England team in his youth, a staggering statistic; and one which must dishearten all professional rugby players with ambitions to play at the top level but who, now 21 or older, did not get the call for age-grade action. England’s 31 will be by no means be unique. Consider that seven of the IRB Junior World Championship 2011 winners have been selected for Steve Hansen’s New Zealand party – that’s almost a quarter of the defending champions’ squad. The team they beat 33-22 that day? England, who had a certain George Ford wearing the No10 jersey and Owen Farrell playing inside centre. Friendly faces: Sam Burgess played rugby league at youth level with some of his colleagues now in the England union side Photo: PA Even more amazingly, especially given their recent tussle for the England No10 shirt, is that Ford and Farrell – whose fathers (Mike and Andy respectively) were giants of rugby league before switching, too – even went to the same school together for a time. The first time the pair featured for England together was at under-16 level, when Ford was only 15, a year younger than Farrell. Undoubtedly there is a desire by the top-tier nations to scour the land for rough diamonds, identifying talent early on in their careers. The next step is to develop those individuals by throwing together the best of the bunch, investing time, money and not a small amount of faith, crossing fingers that the payback will be when they travel to the end of their “international pathway” (as the Rugby Football Union call it) and become fully fledged international stars. Not just that, the hope is that the key members of certain age groups graduate together, as the New Zealanders from the class of 2011 have done. That knowledge and confidence – as well as friendship – which comes from experience of playing with one another at age-grade level in theory makes the jump to Test Match level all the more easy. And, bizarrely, it also backs up why Sam Burgess got the nod from Lancaster, because the rugby league convert has played with many of the England rugby union side before, albeit in the 13-man code. Burgess, who rose to become one of the biggest league talents in the world before being tempted to switch codes and play at centre and, latterly, flanker for Bath Rugby Club, was pleased to see some friendly faces in the England squad while finding his feet. “I know George and Owen, as well as Kyle,” says Burgess, explaining that the trio were rugby league starlets before all jumping across to 15-man union. Fly-half Ford is the player who inspires him most, though. “The way he prepares is impressive,” he continues. “George takes a bit of stick for it sometimes because he’s so serious and committed but he’s probably my main inspiration.” The good players always gravitate towards each other because they have the same mindset George’s father Mike, director of rugby at Bath and a former England coach, explains the friendship between his son and Burgess. “They go back a long way,” he says. “I was coaching England and George was at the Bradford Bulls Academy on a scholarship when he was 15. Sam was playing first team for Bradford. Head coach Steve McNamara offered George a contract and he brought Sam with him. Sam would have been 19. George had already trained with Sam at Bradford and he came round to our house in Oldham and they forged a bit of a relationship there. “When Sam signed for us, I made it clear that the best place for him was at Bath rugby for a number of reasons, one of which was George and Kyle. He asked George a lot of questions about changing clubs – how did he cope? – because George played all his junior rugby in rugby league.” Ford highlights why so much is invested in nurturing young talent through age-grade rugby – yet believes that Burgess is not at a disadvantage necessarily for not doing so, given that he excelled in rugby league previously. “The good players always gravitate towards each other because they have the same mindset,” he says. “They have the same understanding. It's much more than George just telling Sam about the laws of the game and what to do and what not to do. That trust comes from playing together.” • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:16:10.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
