Promoted stories \nThe following day we hit the sights... and the shops. \nFirst off was a visit to the Henry Moore Institute. \nWhile there are works by the sculptor there, the present main exhibition is Paul Neagu: Palpable Sculpture, showing the interesting work of a largely forgotten Romanian multi-media artist. \nCulture quota satisfied it was off to Bundobust on Mill Hill. \nBilled as a craft beer bar with an Indian street food kitchen, it served fantastic, fresh (large) tapas size vegetarian dishes, along with a huge choice of lagers and ales which you could try in a third of a pint tasters. \nWe loved it, and would particularly recommend the okra fries (£3.50). \nNext on the list was the free entry Royal Armouries, the national museum of arms and armour. \nLocated a bit (but not much) further from the centre, we travelled there by a water taxi, which was an attraction all of its own. \nLooking at weapons really isn’t my cup of tea but there’s no denying it’s an impressive collection. \nAnd even I couldn’t help but be charmed by a full-size model of an elephant in armour (as long as I didn’t think too hard about the damage it would have caused and been subject to). \nNext up was shopping: the choice of everything from markets and arcades to high street favourites and designer destinations was immense and our aching feet and rapidly emptying purses couldn’t cope with more than a small sample. \nDinner that night was at the popular Red’s True Barbeque. \nThe food was good and the atmosphere buzzing – great if you like things large, loud and meaty. \nNext morning it was off to Harewood House, a stately home with wonderful gardens. \nWe were so impressed – and spent so long – in the grounds, which included terrace, bird, walled and Himalayan gardens, we scarcely left enough time to look round the elegant 18th century house before dashing back to the city centre for a delicious – and surprisingly good value – lunch at Harvey Nichols. \nPhew... we collapsed into our train seats agreeing that there’s far more to visit Leeds for than a rugby game. \nLeeds will host two matches during the Rugby World Cup. Italy will take on Canada in the first ever international Rugby Union match at Elland Road, the home of Leeds United, on September 26, before USA face Scotland the following day. \nTHE FACTS \nFor more information of destinations and attractions, as well as what else is on in Leeds during the Rugby World Cup 2015 go to VisitLeeds.co.uk Share article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:49:16.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
