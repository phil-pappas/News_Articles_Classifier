The Gala awards ceremony took place on Saturday 5th September at the Forte Village Resort in Sardinia, Italy, and was attended by hundreds of hospitality industry leaders. \nCorinthia Hotel Prague is a modern upscale business and leisure hotel, which has recently completed a €250,000-project to upgrade its meetings and events audio-visual infrastructure. Its state-of-the-art conference facilities now include touch-screen multimedia information kiosks, built-in screens and projectors, newly built sound and light systems, as well as 4.54x2.55m SI Black screen, the first of its kind in Prague. Corinthia Hotels also recently launched a dedicated Meetings app for its corporate meetings and incentives guests, as well as a series of superfood ‘Food for Thought’ menus, designed to keep delegates physically and mentally fit. Located less than five minutes away from Prague city centre and next to the Prague Congress Centre, Corinthia Prague crowns one of Prague’s seven hills, offering panoramic views across the city. The Corinthia Conference and Events Centre offers extensive facilities for over 1,000 delegates. Occupying an entire hotel floor, the meeting facilities are divided in two separate sections joined by a scenic foyer. “This award recognises Corinthia Prague as the very best business hotel in the country, and we are extremely honoured to receive this accolade. Corinthia Prague has been a top choice for meeting and events planners since it opened, and following the recent upgrades to our audio-visual infrastructure and the launch of the Corinthia Hotels Meeting app, we have continued to surpass our corporate guests’ expectations in terms of connectivity, technology, and service,” said Jonathan Pace, General Manager at Corinthia Prague.
