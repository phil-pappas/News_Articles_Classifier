Palm Court, in the Miami Design District, received the award for Outstanding LEED Core & Shell project.\n \nProject architect SB Architects and sustainability consultant The Spinnaker Group were on hand to accept the award.Developed by Miami-based Dacra Development, Palm Court is the second of numerous phases of development that are transforming the Miami Design District from a forgotten part of town into a community dedicated to art and design. The ambitious expansion increases the district’s retail, commercial and art exhibition space, creating a new destination for Miami. As the master architect for the project, SB Architects designed the core and shell – the architectural skeleton for the block – addressing building structure, overall identity and the movement of people through space. The Spinnaker Group acted as sustainability consultant for the project.\n \n \nIn August, the U.S. Green Building Council announced that Palm Court had earned LEED Gold certification for Core & Shell. The LEED Green Building Rating System, overseen by the U.S. Green Building Council, is a voluntary, consensus-based national rating system for developing high-performing, sustainable buildings.\n \n \nSeveral elements of the development and design of Palm Court played important roles in the project’s sustainability. Set in the heart of the city’s existing Design District, Palm Court utilizes an infill site, capitalizing upon development density, community connection and access to public transportation. The team implemented guidelines to ensure that its luxury retail tenants built out their spaces sustainably, matching the sustainability goals for the overall project. The team also managed construction waste, used recycled, locally-sourced and sustainable materials, optimized energy performance, and utilized systems to reduce water use. Nearly every roof in the development is planted as a green roof.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T18:33:21.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
