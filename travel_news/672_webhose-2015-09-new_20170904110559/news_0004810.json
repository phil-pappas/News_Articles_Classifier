A police team of 150 ‘super recognisers’ will be used at the Notting Hill Carnival. Pictured, a policeman blocks his ears from noise.

The highly-skilled officers have a computer-like ability to instantly recall names, faces, dates of birth and details or offenders years after seeing them in person or on file. \nMembers of the 150-strong group will scan faces in the crowd and watch CCTV footage from a central command room to find anyone whose bail conditions mean they shouldn’t be at the event. \nIt’s a unique tactic the police developed during the August 2011 London riots in Operation Withern where a handful of people identified nearly 30 per cent of those captured on CCTV. \n“One super recogniser alone identified nearly 300 of the suspects,” a spokesman for the elite unit said. Packed: More than one million people will attend the Carnival this year. Picture: NIKLAS HALLE'N Source: AFP \nIt’s part of a crackdown on crime at the iconic carnival which began in the 1960s and now attracts more than a million people each year to dance and drink in the streets of Notting Hill. \nThe area was once central to London’s Caribbean community but is now best know as home of bankers and supermodels like Elle McPherson who live in the up-market terraced homes. \nDespite the incredible festival which features more than 60 soundstages and a five kilometre parade route, crime is also a regular feature. \nThis year Superintendent Robyn Williams has warned people not to wear expensive jewellery and use paper maps instead of phones which can be snatched. \nMore than 6000 police will be present, hopefully showcasing their dance moves as well. \nCheck out some of the pictures below or tweet yours to @NewscomauHQ | @Victoria_Craw Police dance off in 2013 A performer in full carnival costume.
