These return flights include those on the Jakarta-Palembang (five flights), Jakarta-Jambi, Jakarta-Pekanbaru and Tanjung Pandan-Pangkalpinang (two flights each) routes. \n\nThe haze is caused by forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan, and has been disrupting flight services on both islands. \n\nBenny Butarbutar, vice president corporate communications of Garuda Indonesia, said: “Garuda had no choice but to cancel the flights due to the limited visibility.” \n\nAs there might be further flight disruptions due to the smog, travellers holding bookings are advised to check flight schedules before heading to the airport, Benny said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:46:31.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
