(AP File Photo)\nAmtrak is boarding a baggage fee bandwagon that has generated billions in revenue for the airline industry.\nThe passenger train operator says that on Thursday that it will start charging $20 to passengers who exceed restrictions for carry-on and personal items.\nCustomers are allowed to bring two personal items weighing up to 25 pounds and two carry-on bags weighing no more than 50 pounds. The fee applies to each item above those limits.\nU.S. airlines started introducing bag fees in 2008 and now charge a standard fee of $25 for the first checked suitcase. The fees are more extensive than what Amtrak plans. They generated $1.6 billion for the airlines in the first quarter of this year.", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:51:39.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
