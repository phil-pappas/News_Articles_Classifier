We are so grateful to our fellow South Australian designers for offering up their time and expertise to assist these talented young designers.”\nStudents and TAFE SA have embraced the award positively, recognising it as a fantastic opportunity for up and coming designers to contribute to developing Adelaide’s expanding fashion industry.\nFinal year TAFE SA fashion students interested in participating were given the opportunity to produce detailed illustrations and present to a panel of five Adelaide Fashion industry mentors and TAFE SA representative Helen Jansson. The brief was to design women’s wear incorporating 70% supplied fabric and 30% of their own choosing.\nThe judging, which recently took place at TAFE SA, saw five finalists announced. They have been paired with five mentors as follows: Tiffany Stuckey will be mentored by Sally Phillips; Sophia McMahon will be mentored by Liza Emanuele; Paula Jago will be mentored by Paul Vasileff of Paulo Sebastian; Shiva Novifar will be mentored by Chris Kontos of TY-LR; and Nikki Stankovic will be mentored by Tiff Manuell.\nThe exciting initiative gives finalists access to industry leaders, whereby they will meet with their mentor twice during the 10-week project to receive support and feedback on their progress.\nThe winner will receive the opportunity to undertake a unique and complete 12-month mentoring program, which will cover all aspects of the fashion industry including strategy, sourcing, design and marketing.\nEach finalist will receive 10 metres of the same black wool crepe kindly donated by the Australian Wool Innovation.
