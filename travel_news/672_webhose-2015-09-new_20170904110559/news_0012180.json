Flights leave from Vegas and the South Rim. Chose the one that's perfect for you. Check out this article. \nWhile you can take an airplane tour of the Grand Canyon any time of year, summer is the optimum time, and the season is closing soon with the arrival of Labor Day. Since many people are using the holiday to squeeze in one last summer trip, the tours will sell out quickly. Airplane Tours Departing From Vegas You can take an airplane tour out of Vegas that flies over the West Rim or the South Rim. The flight to the South Rim takes about an hour, but the West Rim is closer, and you can get there in around 30 minutes. You could drive from Vegas to the South Rim too, but that would take six hours on the road each way. You can choose from two basic tour types. One tour stays in the air and the other lands at the canyon. Since all the planes fly along the same route from Vegas to the Grand Canyon, you'll get to see the Colorado River, Hoover Dam, and Lake Mead no matter what kind of tour you buy. The landing tours stop over at the Grand Canyon so you can enjoy some land activities there for a while, but the air-only tours just fly over the canyon before heading back to Vegas. The air tour offers fantastic views and it is the most affordable option, which is great when you're on a budget. Landing tours give you a better experience of the canyon, and worth the extra money if you can afford it. The airplane tour that lands at the West Rim is especially popular. It's exciting because you can upgrade the tour to include a helicopter descent to the bottom of the canyon and a boat ride along the Colorado River that wends it's way along the base of the towering rock walls. Another exciting upgrade to think about buying is a VIP pass to the Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Skywalk is a huge bridge made from glass panels that allows you to stroll beyond the edge of the rim for 70 feet. You can see the canyon floor an amazing 4000 feet underneath you. You're sure to get a thrill rush from the experience. South Rim Plane Tours The South Rim airplane tour lasts about 45 minutes. The tour originates from the Grand Canyon National Park Airport, which is situated in Tusayan, AZ. The plane takes you over the pristine wilderness area of the North Rim as well as the land that borders the eastern edge of the park. When you land again at the South Rim airport, you will have seen 75 percent of the entire national park. The sightseeing planes used for these tours can carry 19 people. There are two FAA certified pilots on each plane to ensure a safe flight. You'll be comfortable on the plane too. The plane is designed so the wings don't obstruct anyone's view through the large windows and the cabin is roomy for your comfort. You can feel confident when you book your tour that you'll have the best views possible from one of the airplanes. Plane Tours Are More Affordable When you take an airplane tour, you will fly along the same flight path as the tour helicopters. The airplane tours cost less money, which is good for your budget, they carry more passengers, which is good if you have a large family, and they fly at a higher altitude than helicopters. If you'd rather fly with a smaller crowd, then you can take a similar tour on a chopper instead. The drawback is the same trip will cost you around 50 percent more than an airplane flight. The Grand Canyon is a very popular tourist destination, and Labor Day weekend is always busy there. So, buy your tour as soon as you can, and you can buy it conveniently online. Don't wait until the day you want to fly. The seats will probably be sold out if you wait, and if you luck out and find some, you'll have to pay a lot more money for them. To Conclude Now that you know a little about Grand Canyon plane tours over Labor Day, it's time to start planning your trip. Pick the rim you want to tour and then get your seats booked before it's too late. Don't miss out on a thrilling flight you'll always remember, buy your tour as soon as possible, and do it online so you can save some money.
