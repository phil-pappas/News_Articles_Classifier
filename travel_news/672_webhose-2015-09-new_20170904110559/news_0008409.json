That's up from 74.8 per cent the previous month and 75.6 per cent in July 2014.\nHawaiian Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines topped the on-time rankings for the 10th straight month â€” the fifth straight month in that precise order. Spirit Airlines had the lowest on-time rate in July, followed by Frontier Airlines.\nSpirit and Frontier, a pair of no-frills, low-fare airlines, also had the highest complaint rates among the 13 airlines covered in the report. Alaska had the best rate, with less than one passenger in 400,000 filing a formal complaint with the government.\nConsumers filed more than 2,000 complaints with the government about the 13 largest airlines, a 5 per cent increase over the previous month and 31 per cent higher than a year ago.\nCancellations fell to 0.9 per cent of flights, about half the rate for June and for July 2014. The government said it was the lowest July cancellation rate in 21 years of comparable records.\n___\nThe Department of Transportation report can be found at http://1.usa.gov/1OD9id6\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T01:09:54.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
