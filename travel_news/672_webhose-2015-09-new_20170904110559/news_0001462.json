Regulators claim that the vehicles would then emit nitrogen oxides at up to 40 times the approved levels when the emission controls were deactivated. If proven, Volkswagen could face up to $18 billion in fines from U.S Regulators. Published reports suggest that Volkswagen began installing the \"defeat devises\" in the relevant diesel models in 2009.\nBlock & Leviton LLP is investigating whether Volkswagen misled its investors by failing to disclose its intent to avoid compliance with emission controls by installing \"defeat devices\" in certain diesel car models. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Volkswagen ADRs before September 19, 2015 , and have questions about your legal rights or possess information relevant to this investigation, please contact attorney Steven P. Harte of Block & Leviton LLP at (617) 398-5600 or email him at Steven@blockesq.com .
