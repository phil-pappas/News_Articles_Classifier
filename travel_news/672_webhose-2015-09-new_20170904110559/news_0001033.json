The Office of Inspector General will publish online routine summaries of completed investigations for the first time in support of Governor Wolf's call for agencies to provide more transparency and be more accountable to the citizens of Pennsylvania .\n\"The Office of Inspector General is an important asset to state government and Pennsylvania taxpayers,\" Governor Wolf said. \"My administration is committed to furthering transparency and accountability in state government and this is another step forward towards that goal. I applaud Inspector General Grayling Williams and his office for their work in taking this initiative.\"\nThe four summaries published today include reviews of two Department of Transportation investigations, and one each for the Department of Community and Economic Development and the Department of Labor and Industry. The Office of Inspector General will continue to release more summaries of investigations in the future.\n\"I am proud of our work to release these investigative details online for the first time,\" Inspector General Williams said. \"Often taxpayers will not be aware of the work of this office unless an investigation is referred to a law enforcement agency and ultimately results in criminal charges. These summaries inform the public of the important work done by this office to protect taxpayers and improve state government. We hope that publication of these summaries will encourage the public and Commonwealth employees to continue to report waste, fraud, abuse, and employee misconduct concerns to the Office of Inspector General.\"\nInspector General Williams said the Office of Inspector General decided to release only summaries of the investigations to keep the public informed of the office's activities, while avoiding a chilling effect that could occur by releasing more detailed information that could reveal the identity of complainants.\n\"Many of our office's investigations are the result of brave Commonwealth employees and others who come forward with information, and we want future complainants to feel protected,\" Williams said.\nThe summaries released today include investigations of:\nReimbursement requests by contractors of the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development; Receipt of gifts by employees of a Driver License Center of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation; Programs within the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry's Office of Vocational Rehabilitation; and Approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for the closure of a public right-of-way as part of the installation of a sign on adjacent private property. The summaries can be found here on the Office of Inspector General's improved website.\nThe Office of Inspector General receives reports of waste, fraud, abuse, and employee misconduct in the Commonwealth's executive agencies and programs by phone through its toll-free number 1-855-FRAUD-PA (1-855-372-8372) and through its website, www.oig.pa.gov . Complaints can also be filed anonymously.\nMEDIA CONTACT: Jeff Sheridan â€“ 717.783.1116\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pa-governor-wolf-applauds-first-ever-online-publishing-of-inspector-general-investigation-summaries-300146237.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.oig.pa.gov/Reports/Pages/Investigation-Report-Summaries.aspx#.VgAV8tJVhHw", "http://www.oig.pa.gov/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC07252&Transmission_Id=201509211209PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC07252&DateId=20150921", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pa-governor-wolf-applauds-first-ever-online-publishing-of-inspector-general-investigation-summaries-300146237.html"], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T20:16:22.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
