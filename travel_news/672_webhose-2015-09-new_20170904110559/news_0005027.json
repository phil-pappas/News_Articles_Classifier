That’s about it,” said Jenner. “A tragedy like this, you’ll never get over it. You just learn to live with it the best you possibly can.”\nCaitlyn Jenner speaks about new life Jenner also addressed the possibility that she could land in jail.\n“The media wants that picture, don’t they?” she said of a potential mugshot.\n“That is the worst case scenario. I don’t know. We’ll see. The Men’s County Jail [in Los Angeles] - It is an enormous problem that they would put trans-women in Men’s County Jail.”\nHelping Jenner’s case is an US$18.5million ($26 million) lawsuit that was filed against Howe’s estate by the passengers of another car involved in the accident who claim she was the negligent driver.\nTMZ is reporting, however, that those same passengers may also sue Jenner (she’s also being sued by Howe’s family as well as the driver of another car involved in the crash).\nDeadly drive ...

What a tremendous experience this is. Hardly anybody gets to live two genders in their life,” she said.\n“Everybody wonders, ‘Oh, what’s it like to be coming from the other side? You know, their thinking, the way they act, everything?’\n“And here I have the opportunity to do that. And to be honest with you, everything’s so new and fun. From that standpoint, it’s been great.”\nShe then added: “There’s nothing more, nothing better in life to wake up in the morning, look at yourself in the mirror and feel comfortable with yourself and who you are.”\nJenner even made a joke about Halloween costumes doing the rounds, which depict the bustier she wore on her famous Vanity Fair cover.\nDressing up ... Caitlyn Jenner-inspired Halloween costumes have sparked outrage by some, but Jenner says she’s ‘in on the joke’. Picture: Supplied/Anytimecostumes.com “I’m in on the joke. I don’t think it’s offensive at all. I know the [transgender] community does and they’ve gotten a lot of criticism for doing it. I think it’s great… [Still] they could have a better looking outfit, you know?” she laughed. “I could have done my own costume! I mean, that was a serious bustier on the cover of Vanity Fair. I mean at least get some good clothes.”\n“You’ve got to enjoy life. Life’s too short. I can’t get too upset about that type of stuff,” she said.\nGiving back ... Caitlyn Jenner appeared on the premiere episode of the new season of Ellen with Blossom C. Brown, a transgender woman who is hoping to attend nursing school.

They gave me the award,” she said.\n“Did it take a lot of courage to come out? Absolutely. Did I have tremendous respect for Arthur Ashe and that award? Absolutely.\n“And I’m very honored to have them award that to me, not just to me but this entire community. So I’m very pleased the way it turned out.”\nOriginally published as Jenner scared she’ll land in men’s jail", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2ad9708549886017f198bcd2f3e3ecf0", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/df0da8f9a21f8e4ad064e3fe7cddc065", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFhV7-lEPc0", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/caitlyn-jenner-is-scared-shell-end-up-in-a-mens-prison/story-fn907478-1227520305815?sv=96988230e9d52d78e95185577a9a4279", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/df500c5d47556c5580bcecd3505115bd?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/135d3976818525e8348ca1854045e8e7?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e1ee267f02fce88ba297faf32283a638", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/268550fa8e6e0802e41081e6f826e44a", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cd6495223d9a3c63ad714d8a3630e6a4", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/07503218fc4604974d126e8f3bc7d0aa", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&maxRelated=6&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/53c7de4afdca015cd81808baf1b5d7d9?width=650"], "published": "2015-09-09T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:43:20.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
