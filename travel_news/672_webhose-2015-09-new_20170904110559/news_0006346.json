The new year-round service with Europe’s largest regional airline is in addition to the Saturday flight that first took off from Cork Airport last June.\nThe announcement is part of Flybe’s route network expansion as the airline adds 22 more flights to seven key routes to and from Cardiff. The extra flight is perfectly timed for Irish rugby fans across Munster as Ireland are also set to play France in Cardiff’s state-of-the-art Millennium Stadium.\nCork Airport Managing Director, Niall MacCarthy welcomed the extra service stating: “The additional Cardiff flight with Flybe is great news and is good timing for rugby fans ahead of Ireland’s clashes with France and Canada as the whole nation is abuzz with World Cup excitement.\n“Since the new route started in June, it has already provided a significant boost to the local economy in the region, creating new inbound traffic. The route also provides another excellent destination for people from Munster, looking for a fantastic city break. Cardiff boasts an incredible selection of unique attractions, world-class entertainment and premium shopping all within walking distance of the compact city centre.”\nHe added: “Cardiff Airport has become an important gateway to Wales following significant investment in recent years. It’s a vibrant city, which is the UK’s top ranked city for quality of life and boasts a serious passion for world-class culture and for sport.”\nCommenting on the extra service Paul Simmons, Chief Commercial Officer at Flybe, said: “We have been very pleased with the level of support received for our new Cork to Cardiff route from Cardiff. I am delighted that we are now increasing our presence with this additional service to Cork and with the many additional frequencies we are now offering on seven of our most popular routes.”\nCork Airport is the international gateway to the south of Ireland and is uniquely positioned at the start of the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland’s Ancient East.
