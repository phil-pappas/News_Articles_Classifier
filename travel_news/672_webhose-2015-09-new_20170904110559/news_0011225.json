You get to lock in the price of your air ticket with the freedom to pay the balance just four weeks before flight time. \nEnjoy the local cusine \nEAT LOCAL Look for where the locals are eating, and stay away from tourist hot spots at meal times. If the restaurant has a sign outside that says \"English menu\", find somewhere else. If you have your main meal in the middle of the day rather than in the evening you'll save. Most restaurants charge more for dinner than for lunch, even when they serve the same dish. Make do with a light dinner. \nLOCK IN VALUE I'm not normally a big fan of travel money cards but when the dollar stars tumbling with no bottom in sight they offer a way to lock in your dollars against foreign currencies at today's rate. Available from post offices, banks and other financial institutions, these cash passports offer the convenience of ATM withdrawals and the ability to pay for goods and services overseas just as you would with any other debit card. \nBOOK AN APARTMENT Not only are they generally cheaper than a hotel room of similar quality, apartments in big cities give you the opportunity to save on meals and sundry charges such as laundry. Travel with a family or small group and the savings are magnified. Websites such as Airbnb make it easy to find suitable accommodation but check the reviews from past guests and make sure your home-away-from-home is in a good location with easy access to transport. \nSee AirBnB \nLAST MINUTE BARGAINS Hotels with empty rooms often have late-breaking deals with big discounts. Check for special prices on Lastminute, while both Priceline and SkyAuction allow you to haggle with a hotel by naming your price â€“ and the closer to check-in time, the sharper the price.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T00:07:31.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
