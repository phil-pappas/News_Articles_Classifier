TDC’s involvement in Vivid Sydney this year included providing video expertise in cutting edge mapping techniques and core video technology across an unprecedented 10-kilometer distance as the festival expanded into Chatswood and Central Park inner-city precincts. The company worked with Destination NSW, the NSW Government’s tourism and major events agency, as well as various artists for each installation. TDC broke all records by providing nearly 9,000 square meters of video (or 7,464,960,000 video pixels) projected onto the stunning architecture of over 10 buildings in Sydney, during Vivid Sydney’s 18-nights. “Being shortlisted for this award is very exciting. A crucial ingredient to the innovation at Vivid Sydney 2015 and its success was made possible by our highly knowledgeable technical and production teams and Australia’s largest stock of the most advanced video imaging technologies which are deployed in projects to wow, entertain and engage audiences,” said Michael Hassett, managing director at TDC. Not only are TDC shortlisted, but Destination NSW, owner and manager of the Vivid Sydney 2015 festival, is also shortlisted in the Best Event category of the Australian Event Awards.
