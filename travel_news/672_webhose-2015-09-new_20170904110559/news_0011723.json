The new set of notices had already sent stock markets in panic and investors had pulled out their money. The government had then appointed A.P. Shah Committee to look into the issue. The committee has suggested keeping the FII away from the MAT ambit.\nHowever, the government cannot take a final decision, as one of the companies – Castleton, a unit of GlaxoSmithKline has challenged the notice in Supreme Court of India. The judges are yet to decide on the dispute.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 11:47 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:31:23.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
