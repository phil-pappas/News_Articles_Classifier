Saffron robe preparation \nFrom Oct 30-Nov 21, the annual Chullakathin saffron robe preparation and presentation ceremonies will be held at several temples in the Northeast. \nChullakathin is a robe presentation ceremony that requires the unity of many Buddhists to collect cotton, weave, sew, dye and present a set of saffron robes to a monk within one day.

Nowadays, only Chullakathin ceremonies take place in the North and Northeast. \nIn Mukdahan province, the first ceremony will be performed at Wat Matchimawas in Don Tan district during Oct 30-Nov 1.
