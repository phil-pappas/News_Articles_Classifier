(Photo: Michigan Department of Transportation)\n3 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE DETROIT — Near the tip of Michigan’s “mitt,” a spring has been bubbling deep underground for months, just so it could mess with Labor Day drivers.\nLast week, the hidden stream gave state taxpayers a $1.2 million soaking when it collapsed pavement on U.S. 31 in Emmet County. No one was hurt, but engineers say they need 85 semi-truckloads of rock to shore up 200 feet of damage.\nBound to aggravate people more than the price tag, though, is the timing. Highway officials announced this week that a detour around the problem will last through Labor Day weekend — the very time when the Michigan Department of Transportation prides itself on having construction sites open to traffic.\n“We do try to pull the orange barrels aside,” said James Lake, spokesman for MDOT in the northern Lower Peninsula.\nUSA TODAY\nMichigan ghost hunters chase Upper Peninsula's unexplained\nThe devilish timing is exactly why this 12-mile detour on country roads, starting about 25 miles south of the Mackinac Bridge, could cause big holiday headaches. On Labor Day, this rural spot in Michigan's highway network is expected to be the conduit for an estimated 14,000 vehicles — more than double its usual volume — as hordes of motorists rush pell-mell to the Mackinac Bridge, psyched to join the big annual bridge walk. They all may come screeching to a halt at this pinch point just north of Alanson, presumably with sneakers laced and coffee cups in hand, well before dawn on Monday.\nFor Detroiters, the 58th annual bridge walk won't compete with this weekend’s Jazz Fest in Detroit, nor with the Ford Arts, Beats & Eats festival in Royal Oak. As well, the usual Labor Day parades are scheduled in Detroit and Hamtramck.\nIn northern Michigan, though, strolling across the Straits is a marquee event.\nAAA Michigan predicts that about 1.2 million Michiganders will take road trips over the four-day Labor Day weekend, the highest mark since the pre-recession travel volume of 2008.\n\"After all, it's the last hurrah of summer,\" AAA Michigan spokeswoman Sue Hiltz said.\nFor this year’s bridge walk, organizers expect 40,000 people — 10,000 more than last year, she said. They'll make the 5-mile walk from north to south, starting at 7 a.m., with Gov. Rick Snyder set to uphold tradition by leading the way.\n“That guy walks fast,” said Chris Christensen, 43, of Boyne City, who walked just behind Snyder a few years ago. Christensen is planning to make his ninth bridge walk with wife Sara Christensen, 39, and any other family members they can recruit. They’ll dodge the washed out highway detour by taking county roads over to I-75, he said.\nBut plenty of others may need to do the same. Would-be walkers have until 11 a.m. to get to the start of the bridge walk in St. Ignace, after navigating the yearly crush of cars, buses and pedestrians that jam both ends of the bridge, beginning well before dawn and limiting bridge traffic to one lane each way. The last thing anyone hoping to check off a bucket-list bridge walk is running into a highway detour 20 minutes south of the goal.\nBridge-walk wannabes likely to get caught in the backup will be coming from the tourist havens of Harbor Springs, Petoskey, Charlevoix and points between. Even those who duck the detour by making a beeline to I-75 on the way north could get caught coming home “when a lot of people like to take a leisurely route home,” and so they might be tempted to head south from Mackinaw City on U.S. 31, Christensen said.\nThe sunken, water-logged trouble spot on U.S. 31 is halfway between the small towns of Brutus and Alanson, on a two-lane highway with a speed limit of 55 mph. The official state detour is barely any farther in mileage but bound to be slower on a rural, county road that includes about 50 yards of a dirt-road access drive from U.S. 31.\n3 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT //usat.ly/1UsMxdm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e4e449d49a06221f27352847c4f5643bf0d12273/c=69-0-564-372&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768245457152320-DFP-holiday-roads-2-.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768245457152320-DFP-holiday-roads-2-.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UsMxdm&text=Detour%20to%20create%20holiday%20havoc%20in%20Michigan&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1UsMxdm&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1UsMxdm", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f52eaa8df9c9efdd2efe9439b12c6394aa40f87e/c=0-125-2400-1475&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/30/DetroitFreePress/B9318614468Z.1_20150830205755_000_G9LBP2RK6.1-0.jpg", "http://on.freep.com/1EAioH9"], "published": "2015-09-03T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T09:14:40.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
