It has 3,000 miles of stunning coastline and a spectacular desert; lush, green valleys and ochre-tinted bushland; a rich indigenous history dating back 4,000 years and patchwork vineyards producing award-winning wines. The best way to explore it all is to follow the Epicurean Way, which wraps up spectacular sights, gourmet experiences and a warm welcome from locals in an easily digestible self-drive route. Taking in tall skies and riesling vines of the Clare Valley, the vibrant viticulture and culinary delights of the Barossa Valley, the kaleidoscope of colour that is the Adelaide Hills and the briny, ocean-rich flavours of McLaren Vale, it is the perfect introduction to South Australia, seamlessly linking together the four famous wine regions. Along the way you will encounter lost recipes, recovered traditions, sacred sites and a hard-earned intimacy between people and places. All of this, resting amid a magnificent land and seascape, has been shaped over four hundred million years, and continues to adapt and change. A host of vineyard restaurants and stylish eateries ensure that South Australia’s gourmet offerings more than match its viticulture The gateway to the touring route is Adelaide, the state capital, a city with historic charm that belies its new-found status as one of the world’s “must-visit” destinations, according to both Lonely Planet and The New York Times . An Arts Festival programme that has won more awards than any other in the southern hemisphere, internationally recognised restaurants and chefs and the next generation of destination bars and coffee houses can all be found along its pavements, balconies and newly uncovered laneways. Venture beyond and you’ll discover there is so much more to these familiar wine regions than their celebrated vintages. A Mediterranean climate has gifted South Australia with the perfect conditions for cultivating fruit and vegetables and local eateries make the most of the fine fresh produce on their doorstep. The five-day, self-drive tour takes in farmers’ markets, cheese shops, breweries and winery cellar doors offering tastings. At every stop is another chance to combine the best food and drink on offer in the state. At d’Arenberg winery in McLaren Vale, you can play winemaker for a day and take your creation with you when you leave as the ultimate souvenir. Hahndorf Hill winery in the Adelaide Hills combines two delights – wine and chocolate – in a special “chocovino” experience, while nearby the Lobethal Bierhaus serves hand-crafted beers alongside meals made with locally sourced ingredients. Savour a taste of South Australian wine along the Epicurean Way In the Barossa Valley, learning about wine can be balanced with a culinary education. Casa Carboni is an Italian cookery school in Angaston offering both classes and demonstrations. And Maggie Beer is an Australian food legend; make sure you stop by her farm shop near Nuriootpa to pick up her products. Become a wine expert with a masterclass at the Jacob’s Creek Visitor Centre in Rowland Flat and combine the grape and the hop as you learn about award-winning rieslings and visit the micro-brewery at Knappstein, in the Clare Valley. A host of vineyard restaurants and stylish eateries headed by world-renowned chefs ensure that South Australia’s gourmet offerings more than match its viticulture. Seasonal delights are served up in an 1840s homestead at Hentley Farm, in the Barossa Valley, while Fino, in McLaren Vale, serves provincial specials that are perfect for sharing. No matter what experiences you choose, the Epicurean Way will give you the perfect introduction to South Australia’s riches as well as a guided tour around some of its most picturesque regions.
