When it comes to beauty and variety there are few countries that can rival this twin island nation. So it is no surprise that it was named World’s Best Country by readers in the Telegraph Travel Awards for three years running. From soaring peaks and dramatic fiordlands in the South Island, to fascinating Maori culture and bubbling geothermal activity in the North Island, New Zealand is bursting with delights to explore. And APT’s fully inclusive 28-day New Zealand Splendour tour is the perfect way to experience it all. Travelling in a group of no more than 40 people, the itinerary has been carefully planned to showcase the best of the country. You will spend two nights in most places so that you never feel rushed and will be escorted by a tour director and expert local guides throughout. APT holidays are not only about quality, but about choice. In key locations, APT’s Freedom of Choice concept offers a range of included activities or dining experiences so you can tailor your adventure to suit your particular interests and tastes. In addition, you’ll enjoy many Signature Invitations – tailor-made excursions designed to help you delve deeper under the skin of each destination. Your holiday starts with a flight to Singapore where a two-night stay in the luxurious InterContinental will allow you to adjust to time differences and explore the city with a guide. Cruise the length of Milford Sound, switching your eyes between the lofty peaks and the water to see if you can spot dolphins Your first stop in New Zealand is Christchurch, the gateway to the Southern Alps. Here, enjoy the day at leisure to explore the beautiful city or relax in the comfort of your hotel. You will get a powerful sense of things to come on the drive from Christchurch into Mount Cook National Park, home of Australasia’s highest mountain. En route there is a visit to the tiny but charming Church of the Good Shepherd, built as a tribute to the region’s pioneers. From your base at the Hermitage Hotel, you can take a nature walk, though few will resist the opportunity to venture out on a small boat among the icebergs on the lake at the base of the Tasman Glacier. The next stop is Dunedin, visiting the unusual spherical Moeraki Boulders en route. From here, wildlife lovers can choose to set off to find penguins or the albatross colony on the remote Otago Peninsula, while history lovers can visit New Zealand’s only castle. Settle in lakeside Te Anau for two nights, where you can choose from another host of Freedom of Choice options. Set off on an incredible wilderness cruise of Doubtful Sound; explore the limestone caves illuminated by glow-worms; or take a jet boat ride along the Upper Waiau River. The following day, you will cruise the entire length of Milford Sound, switching your eyes between the lofty peaks – including the great triangle of rock Mitre Peak – and the water to see if you can spot dolphins. Immerse yourself in Maori culture Queenstown, the country’s adventure capital, is the next destination and well deserving of a three-night stay. Here, the choices abound with plenty of locations that formed the dramatic backdrops of the Lord of the Rings films to seek out on a dedicated tour, along with lovely lakeside walks and birdwatching trips. The most thrilling option, though, is to zoom along the spearmint-coloured waters of the Shotover River Canyons on a jet boat, which can operate in shallow water. Freedom of Choice dining options on one evening include the excellent seafood eatery Finz and the Skyline Restaurant, reached by a gondola, with incredible views. With more mesmerising views of lakes and mountains, next you’ll reach the Westland National Park and another huge glacier, Franz Josef. Here your base is the five-star Te Waonui Forest Retreat, where your room is guaranteed a view of the lush rainforest and surrounding peaks. The magical setting is complemented by a delectable four-course dinner. So far you have travelled by luxury coach and boat. Now it’s time to try another transport method – the renowned TranzAlpine train, one of the world’s great rail journeys. Stay in luxurious eco-lodges, including the Te Waonui Forest Retreat The train winds up through beech forests and across the Southern Alps with ever-changing vistas of mountains, gorges and rivers before gently descending into the farmland of the Canterbury Plains. After a night spent in Christchurch, you will arrive in the charming town of Blenheim, where Freedom of Choice activities include tasting the local Marlborough wines. Next, crossing the strait by the inter-island ferry – itself a highly scenic journey – a whole new world awaits on the North Island. Wellington is the country’s cultured capital and is a pleasing city to explore with a guide. It boasts a fascinating observatory and planetarium, but another Freedom of Choice excursion is to Zealandia. This eco-park’s array of animals in a natural habitat, includes unusual species such as the tuatara, a reptile resembling a small dinosaur, and the endangered takahe flightless bird. Your tour continues to make its leisurely way to the art deco town of Napier. APT loves to dish out treats, so expect to find a traditional high tea waiting for you before an overnight stay in a charming hotel. Geologically, New Zealand is one of the youngest countries in the world and remnants of the volcanic forces that formed the islands are still very much evident. Rotorua is a centre for this activity and, after stopping at Lake Taupo, the country’s largest lake, on the way there will be ample time to explore this wonderland. You’ll have close-up views of bursting geysers, bubbling pools of mud and strange formations formed by the minerals in the superheated waters. Take a harbour cruise; a guided exploration of rainforests and black-sand beaches; or a wine tour to picturesque Waiheke Island In this area, there’s a completely different experience in store. At the Tamaki Maori Village, you’ll see the indigenous people of New Zealand give a goosebump-inducing performance of the haka – famously associated with the All Blacks rugby team – before serving you a Hangi feast of meat, seafood and vegetables. It is cooked below the ground on stones heated by the same geothermal energy that propels the geysers. A two-night stay affords chances to see more Lord of the Rings locations such as Hobbiton, or perhaps you will choose to visit the Te Puia Thermal Reserve and New Zealand’s largest boiling mud pool at Wai-O-Tapu? In the evening, you will be treated to a succulent roast lamb dinner hosted at the nearby working dairy farm Longlands. Another of New Zealand’s greatest natural wonders is yet to come; the magnificent Bay of Islands, a subtropical region in the far north that is utterly beautiful. Here, 144 green islands – some with delightful sandy coves – are scattered across the bright blue sea, with quirky towns lining the coast. Keep a look out for dolphins as you cruise Milford Sound The Freedom of Choice activities here are especially inviting. There’s a sail on the bay on a tall ship, a dolphin-spotting expedition or a visit to Russell, the picturesque village and original capital where the first Europeans set up home. It may be worth saving your sea legs for the next day because there’s a catamaran cruise out to Cape Brett on which you will see the Hole in the Rock natural arch. Your final two nights are spent in Auckland, the “City of Sails”. Here you can choose to take a harbour cruise; a guided exploration of rainforests and black-sand beaches; or a wine tour to picturesque Waiheke Island before a special farewell dinner to end your adventure. If you’ve dreamed of exploring the best New Zealand has to offer, you can rest assured that APT has everything covered with its New Zealand Splendour tour – in grand style, too.
