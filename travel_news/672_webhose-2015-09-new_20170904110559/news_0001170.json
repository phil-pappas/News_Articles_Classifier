September is Passport Awareness Month. \nAfter implementing the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, requiring a passport for air travel to and from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean, the State Department experienced a rush of applications, from 12.1 million in 2006 to 18.6 million the following year. A passport is valid for 10 years, and the agency is preparing for an onslaught of renewals. \n“We encourage passport applicants to apply for or renew U.S. passports well ahead of planned travel,” said Brenda Sprague, deputy assistant secretary for passport services. “We anticipate longer than average wait times for passport processing” starting around the new year. \nTo handle the deluge, the department has added more than 550 passport services employees since 2007 and plans to hire more during the next two years. It also opened 10 more passport agencies across the country and might expand call-center hours during the next few years. \nProcessing time is, on average, four to six weeks. However, during particularly heavy periods, the wait might stretch to 10. \nThe agency expects 16 million applications in 2016 and 20 million the following year. \nTo avoid the stress, Sprague says to “renew at once” if you have six months of validity remaining and “consider renewing now” if you have a year left. She also reminds travelers that they can no longer receive page inserts overseas. \n“If you are running out of pages even though your book remains valid,” Sprague said, “you should also renew.” \nMail is the quickest and cheapest route to renewal; you can find all of the forms and requirements on the State Department’s website, www.state.gov. \nAnother helpful tip: September through December is typically slow season. Frequent jet-setters should request a 52-page book so they can avoid any emergency trips to the passport agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T17:13:32.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
