Both based in Bedfordshire, the agreement will see the two organisations – the UK’s largest airline and one of the UK’s most respected post-graduate institutions – work together on projects which support each other’s strategic objectives.\nMarking the start of the partnership and easyJet’s forthcoming twentieth birthday, Cranfield students have been tasked with providing insight into what aviation might look like in 2035. The results of which could spark the starting point of pioneering advances and innovations to influence the next 20 years of flying.\nThe partnership between the two organisations aims to build on the traditions of innovation for both parties. The clear overlaps in their specialisms will see them collaborate through the exchange of innovation ideas and knowledge, insight and research and in the areas of employment and learning.\nThere is already a core group of Cranfield University alumni at easyJet and CEO Carolyn McCall was awarded a Doctor of Science Honoris Causa from the institution last year.\nCommenting on the partnership, easyJet CEO, Carolyn McCall, said:\n“easyJet has changed the face of flying 20 years ago and has always been an innovative and pioneering airline. We are continuing to pioneer the use of new digital and engineering technologies and apply them across the airline.\n“We already have a long standing informal relationship with Cranfield and this new agreement builds on this and reflects overlaps in our strategic objectives. The best innovation is based on collaboration and team working so the aim is to bring people from Cranfield and easyJet to share knowledge through seminars, workshops and lectures.\n“Senior easyJet people can also provide insight to Cranfield students across a range of topics through lectures and other events.\n“On the eve of our 20th anniversary, we are looking forward to seeing what the next 20 years could bring and believe that a strong mutually beneficial relationship between two leading organisations in aviation innovation will generate lasting benefits for the next generation of aviation experts.”\nCEO and Vice-Chancellor Sir Peter Gregson, said:\n“Our region has been at the heart of the aviation industry for many years. The strategic partnership between Cranfield and easyJet brings two likeminded organisations together, building opportunities to foster innovation and provide our students with unique access to the airline industry, helping to develop the next generation of leaders within the sector.”\n“Marking the start of our formal partnership, the Future of Flight competition allows our students to showcase their radical ideas for the 2035 vision of the industry, presenting environmental solutions, operational improvements and ideas to enhance customer experience.”\nThe Future of Flight competition will see students compete in four categories; cabin design, aircraft design, airport experience and in-flight experience with the winning designers to have their ideas showcased during easyJet’s 20th birthday celebration event on 10th November. They will also receive a pair of easyJet tickets to a destination of their choice and £200 worth of amazon vouchers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:25:59.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
