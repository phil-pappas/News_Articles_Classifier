But with President Obama restoring diplomatic ties and loosening travel restrictions, you can cruise to the island on so-called “people-to-people” exchanges. American companies have jumped at the opportunity to get into what’s expected to be a very hot market – a 50-year embargo inevitably leads to quite a bit of pent-up demand. \nEuropean companies such as MSC Cruises, which is sailing its MSC Opera to Cuba in December for a full season of Havana-based itineraries, operate under different rules. The MSC cruises are not currently being marketed to Americans. \nHere’s a rundown of Cuba cruises on tap. \nCelestyal Cruises: Canada-based Cuba Cruise charters a 1,200-passenger ship, the Celestial Crystal, from Cyprus-based Louis Cruises, and has been doing cruises to Cuba for three years. This season’s one-week sailings, from November through February, include immersive shore excursions, unlimited drinks and gratuities. You visit Havana and five other ports (including Montego Bay, Jamaica). The cruises embark from Havana or Montego Bay. Cuban food and entertainment are featured onboard. Fares are from $1,529 per person. The ship will also play host this season to passengers on cruise and land tours sold by Globus, Road Scholar, Insight Cuba and Central Holidays. \nFathom: Carnival Corp., parent of Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises and eight other brands, is dipping a big toe in Cuba with its new volunteer vacation brand , called Fathom. The company has U.S. government approval (and was awaiting word from Cuba) to launch “people-to-people” tours of the island beginning in May 2016. The one-week cruises will operate bi-weekly out of Miami. On alternative weeks the ship will cruise to the Dominican Republic, on a program that begins in April. Fares for the Cuba cruises are from $2,990 – including all on-board social impact-related activities and some on-the-ground cultural immersion activities. \nNorwegian Cruise Line Holdings: The details are still sketchy on this one, but NCLH’s Cuban-born CEO Frank Del Rio has made clear he’s gung ho on bringing ships to Cuba – the first one likely a 684-passenger ship from the company’s Oceania Cruises. Government approvals are being sought for educational, “people-to-people” cruises to the island nation. NCLH is also parent company of Norwegian Cruise Line and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. \nHaimark: This Chicago-based small ship line said it would begin offering 10-day cruises to Cuba out of Miami starting in February. The sailings will be on the 210-passenger Saint Laurent, with itineraries visiting Havana, Maria La Gorda, Cienfuegos, Trinidad, Santiago de Cuba, Parque Nacional Alejandro de Humboldt and Holguin. Haimark plans to operate the cruises in partnership with United Caribbean Lines, one of several ferry operations that received a license from the U.S. Treasury in May to sail to Cuba. Haimark was awaiting further government approvals. Fares start at $4,599. \nInternational Expeditions: This travel company plans to visit Cuba with the 48-passenger Panorama and 46-passenger Panorama II. IE announced it’s waiving the single supplement on the cruises for those traveling solo , through 2017. The cruises from one of three ports in Cuba (air from Miami is included) will visit Trinidad, Viñales, Soroa, Cienfuegos and dock in Havana for three nights. On the “people-to-people” cruises passengers will meet with doctors, musicians, conservationists and other local guests during daily excursions, the company said. Fares are from $4,198. \nPearl Seas: Connecticut-based Pearl Seas Cruises, which is owned by the same company as American Cruise Lines, plans to launch “people-to-people” cruises in March on the 210-passenger Pearl Mist. The program is awaiting U.S. government and Cuban government approval. The one-week and 10-day sailings will be out of Florida. Port calls will include Havana, Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. Fares for the 10-day sailings are from $7,580.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T00:00:41.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
