The punk rock band will perform at El Sótano in Barrio Amón, San José, on Sept. 11, alongside the Costa Rican bands Overseas , The Movement in Codes and Diger , and Canadian musician Chris Snelgrove . Costa Rica is the first stop on Title Fight’s Latin American tour, which includes countries such as Panama, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. \nTitle Fight was formed in 2003 in Kingston, Pennsylvania by Jamie Rhoden on guitar and vocals, Ned Russin on bass and vocals, and Ben Russin on drums. In 2005, guitarist Shane Moran joined the band. Besides playing punk rock, Title Fight has also journeyed through genres including melodic hardcore, hardcore punk, post-hardcore and indie rock. The band has released three albums: Shed, Floral Green and Hyperview, released in February 2015. \nThe band has played some large venues, such as California’s Coachella Fest in 2014, but will have a more intimate audience on Friday. \n“Title Fight has become a big band and has been playing in big venues with an audience made up of 1,000 or more people. Here, they will be performing in front of 300 people,” said Destiny Recordings’ producer, Alejandro Guerrero. \nBassist and producer Alejandro Guerrero.
