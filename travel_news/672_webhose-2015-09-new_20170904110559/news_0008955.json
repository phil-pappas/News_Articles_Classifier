The mattresses, made by Naturepedic of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, meet the most stringent of green textile certifications without sacrificing the comfort, luxury and durability desired of a high-quality mattress for a restful night’s sleep. Enchanté is the first hotel globally to be outfitted with Naturepedic mattresses. Enchanté’s owner Abby Ahrens’ commitment to sustainable luxury and a superior guest experience led her to seek a top-quality mattress that also assured a clean and memorable sleep experience. Certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard, the only third-party organic certification recognized by the USDA for organic mattresses, Naturepedic mattresses are manufactured using non-GMO, plant-based fabrics and sustainably-harvested wools. Naturepedic mattresses are also produced without the use of flame retardants and other toxic chemicals commonly used in mattress production while meeting and exceeding safety standards and regulations for mattresses.\nFounded by Barry A. Cik, an environmental engineer, Naturepedic began by producing fully organic crib mattresses after Cik became aware of the threats that common, chemical-laden mattresses posed to newborns and infants. The company soon expanded their offerings to include hand-crafted mattresses for adults following the same rigorous quality standards.\nA Naturepedic EOS mattress is featured in each of Enchante’s 19 rooms, with queen- or king-size options. Fitting squarely within Enchante’s chic and fashionable French aesthetic and European-style hospitality, the EOS mattress’ luxurious design showcases a signature quilt and beautiful fabrics with multiple comfort layers. Enchanté selected Naturepedic mattresses to offer guests a cozy sleep experience that also leaves the body supported for proper rest.\n“Enchanté is a part of Silicon Valley, where environmental awareness is at the forefront of every industry, and this was an important consideration when seeking a mattress for my guests.” says Ahrens. “I was certain Naturepedic was the right choice for Enchanté the moment I discovered the company – the rich production history, the values the company was founded upon, the commitment to quality and health all aligned with what I was seeking for Enchanté.”\nEnchanté’s guests have been enamored by Naturepedic’s mattresses, calling them “supremely comfortable” and “a unique component in an already stunning hotel,” delivering “the best night’s sleep I’ve had in some time.”\nGuests of Enchanté are able to purchase the EOS mattress through the hotel. The EOS mattress is customized for individual sleep preferences and includes dual customization for shared beds. An EOS Queen mattress is priced at $2,599.\nOffering an elegant and romantic overnight experience with a touch of Paris through French artwork, antiques and décor, Enchante’s provides Silicon Valley travelers wary of common options with an unforgettable experience that demands repeat stays.\nFor more imagery, videos plus fact sheets for Enchante Boutique Hotel and Naturepedic, please click here .\nABOUT ENCHANTÉ BOUTIQUE HOTEL:\nEnchanté Boutique Hotel is a brand new experience in luxury hospitality for Silicon Valley and the city of Los Altos, the birthplace of Apple Inc.
