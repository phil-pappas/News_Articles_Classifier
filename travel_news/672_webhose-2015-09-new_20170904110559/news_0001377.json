From sponsored networking functions, media briefing slots and education tracks, more organisations than ever before are acknowledging the value that these platforms provide in terms of fulfilling engagement and awareness building objectives to a captive audience. Headlining the sponsored networking functions was Thailand Convention & Exhibition Bureau (TCEB)’s anticipated ‘Heaven Unveiled. A Night in Paradise’ Opening Ceremony and Welcome Dinner yesterday evening. Filled with pure indulgence, delegates were treated to a spectacular evening of unrivalled Thai cuisine, and a side of Thailand never seen before. Said Nopparat Maythaveekulchai, President of TCEB, “As the host of the Opening Ceremony, TCEB had the opportunity to showcase Thailand as Asia’s capital for business events connections, and to create awareness among the MICE industry players on a global as well as nationwide scale. The Opening Ceremony represented the start of the trade show, as well as the beginning of many new relationships and partnerships for the delegates. In turn, the exposure we had received was tremendously beneficial.” 6 other destinations, CVBs and Corporates including Seoul Metropolitan Government, Dubai Business Events, Frasers Hospitality, Tourism Promotions Board Philippines, Oakwood and HRS have secured hosted luncheon, dinner and coffee break sessions today that delivered a curated attendance of buyers and media that fit their respective target profiles. In addition to that, Singapore Tourism Board is co-locating its hosted luncheon on 1st October, in conjunction with IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific 2015 to a select group of local buyers. On the motivation behind their exclusive luncheon for 30 Southeast Asia buyers, Karina Lance, Senior Manager, Sales and Convention Services of Dubai Business Events said, “Dubai city is constantly evolving. Therefore, the Dubai Business Events sponsored luncheon is a platform for us to further develop relationships with our clients, and provide them with new updates on the offerings in the business events field. We look forward to connecting with Asian MICE meeting planners and decision makers during the networking lunch.” Said its Chief of Marketing and Promotions of Tourism Promotions Board Philippines, Susan Del Mundo, “The sponsored dinner will be our platform to re-intensify our campaign and build a momentum for the Philippine MICE industry. We hope to garner more interest among the high quality meetings and incentive travel organisers to explore Philippines – currently positioned as one of the top Asian countries with emerging economy.” “We are looking forward to the 2015 show to cement our presence in the Asia-Pacific region. We are sure this year will deliver another inspiring event, that offer several opportunities for us to engage with our clients and build new relationships,” Craig Ryan, Managing Director, Asia Pacific of Oakwood WorldWide said. Meanwhile, TCEB, Malaysia Convention & Exhibition Bureau, Taiwan Tourism Bureau, Indonesia Convention Exhibition, India Tourism, and Thai Airways International took advantage of the scheduled media briefings to announce their latest developments and campaigns to the international attending media – underscoring the importance of IT&CMA and CTW Asia-Pacific as a global publicity stage. The huge sponsorship support was also extended to the education programme, with Carlson Wagonlit Travel sponsoring CTW Asia-Pacific Session 1 “Megatrends in the Corporate Travel World” where industry experts shared about the emergence of the sharing economy, both in the accommodation and transport sectors, and how it could reshape the future of corporate travel. “We are proud to be both sponsor and participant in the session, where we identify today’s most significant trends and highlights their impact on our industry. We care deeply about our clients’ futures and the innovations which will shape them. By sharing our knowledge and expertise, we ensure we are constantly innovating and developing the industry for the future,” Alvan Aiau, Vice President, Sales & Program Management, Asia Pacific of Carlson Wagonlit Travel said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:25:44.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
