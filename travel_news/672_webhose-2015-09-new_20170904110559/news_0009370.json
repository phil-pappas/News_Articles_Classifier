The GTDC website will be transformed into an e-commerce portal and a mobile app will simultaneously be launched in a bid to provide tourists end-to-end solutions during their stay in Goa.\nThe new services are expected to commence on World Tourism Day, September 27, making Goa the first State to have them. These will be introduced in six different languages – Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, French and German in addition to Hindi and English.\n“The website was earlier restricted to giving information. We realized it could be converted into an e-commerce portal where every bit of Goa including its history, tourist locations, adventures trips, etc will be included,” GTDC MD Nikhil Desai said.\nThe services will help visitors browse through and choose from packages, hotel bookings, site- seeing trips, adventure trips and other attractions. The app, Desai said, will be an encyclopaedia while the e-commerce database will be an eye-catcher.\nQuantum Designs, a Mumbai-based company, has been tasked with the project.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T23:07:05.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
