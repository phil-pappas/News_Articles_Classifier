The road border crossings with Serbia of Croatia are also almost shut as it claimed that it is unable to cope with the migrant influx of more than 11,000 people. Railway stations at Tovarnik over the Croatian side of the border have also been closed to the border with Hungary where there were hundreds of migrants waiting for trains to Zagreb. Advice from the Foreign Office states that the disruptions and delays were possible at rail and road border crossings with Serbia, Hungary, and Slovenia, as a result of significant numbers of people seeking to transit Croatia.\nCrowds found themselves blocked at Serbia’s border with Hungary, after the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban completed a razor-wire fence to stem the influx.\nRest of Europe\nSlovenia According to the country’s interior ministry, more than 1,000 migrants were expected to arrive by Saturday, mainly from Zagreb. As it is unclear how long the border with Croatia will remain open, the routine schedule of the trains to Ljubljana from Zagreb may be affected. Around 100 people were being held Friday at a makeshift processing centre in the border town of Berizce.\nHungary Following a recent disruption, the international train services from Budapest Keleti train station have now resumed. The Foreign Office has advised the travellers to “continue to monitor local media, and check with your carrier and the Hungarian Railways (MÁV) website” for the regular updates. Here has been considerable disruption to rail and road transport since the end of August 2015 from Budapest to the Austrian border as the website states. This is due to police and border enforcement action as a result of significant numbers of people seeking to transit through Hungary.\nKos The Foreign Office said that there has been an increase in the number of migrants arriving on the Greek islands as well. Kos is one of them. The Foreign Office also said that the British Embassy is keeping the situation under review however, at present there are no reports of any specific risks to British nationals visiting these islands. The refugees have been housed in tents along the shore promenade of the main town which is between the yacht marina and the medieval castle. Generally, this is the place where the tourist-friendly pedestrian walkway and cycle path are. However, this has not impinged on tourism according to the officials.\nLesbos Greek officials and other bodies have moved 29,000 people through an expedited registration process, with extra ferries running 24 hours a day in order for them to quickly transit off the island. Although the migrants are still arriving, those working with refuges say the situation has calmed down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:51:35.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
