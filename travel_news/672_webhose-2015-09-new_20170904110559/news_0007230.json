Through demonstration pods and a stage program, participants will be able to see how cities use SAP® technology to become smarter.\nCityApp\nThis solution features crowdsourcing functionality that lets citizens report defects and damage in their immediate vicinity. Algorithms assimilate these reports with data, such as traffic density within that city sector, which can result in optimized city administration. SAP presents its \"CityApp\" project in cooperation with the city of Nuremberg.\nSmart traffic control\nThis technology shows how Big Data-driven insights based on real-time traffic conditions and predictive analytics can help cities run smarter. Smart traffic control allows optimized traffic light controls and additional car lanes to help avoid rush-hour traffic congestion. Congestion indexes and speed controls based on data from RFID, GPS, camera and induction loop technologies provide pictures of real-time traffic issues and compare conditions between city sectors. Origin-destination analysis compares travel behaviors between city sectors, areas, streets and multimodal travel.\nTwoGo® mobile app\nThis mobile app by SAP shows how software can help users share rides, thereby helping enterprises, employees, institutions and local authorities save time and money.\nSAP Vehicle Insights\nThis analytics cloud application combines vehicular data with sensor data to provide actionable insight into driver behavior patterns and driver efficiency. The software helps logistics and mobility services monitor live vehicle conditions and manage within constraints imposed by pollution and traffic congestion. The application helps fleet operators manage their fleets optimally.\n\"With the growing number of connected vehicles, broader use of sensors and even autonomous driving on the near horizon, there is a serious opportunity to transform cities, industries and businesses,\" said Stephan Brand , vice president, Products & Innovation at SAP.\nFor more information, visit the SAP News Center .
