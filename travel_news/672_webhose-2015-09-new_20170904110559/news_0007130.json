Then consider travelling to Nyeri where a lodge offers visitors a chance to do just that. \nSerena Mountain Lodge combines both the allure of the wild and the tranquillity of Mt Kenya Forest. \nA journey to this place from Nairobi takes only three hours by road. However, it is also accessible by air via Nanyuki airstrip located only 45 kilometres away. \nWhile here, the journey up the Sagana River normally starts at 9am from Serena Mountain Lodge, with visitors getting a ride through the forest in the hotel’s van. \nUsing fishing rods, visitors line up by the river whose sparkling clean, clear and cold waters flow at a slow, majestic pace down the mountain. \nAt a close distance, one can clearly see the exotic Rainbow and Brown Trout fish that were introduced by the colonial government in 1908, swim around. \n“Guests are encouraged to catch fish for fun and return them to the water but if they trap a bigger one, one is allowed carry it to the lodge where we cook it for him or her,” says Kathurima Mburugu, the lodge’s general manager. \nAccording to Mr Mburugu, the best time to go for sport fishing is during the cold seasons since trouts prefer very cold waters and during this time, they swim down-stream unlike the hot season when they swim up-stream in search of cool temperatures. \nAway from sport fishing, guest are also taken out for morning and evening nature walks deep in Mt Kenya Forest. \nFirst, the willing visitors assemble at the point where safety precautions are clearly spelt out. \nAccompanied by an armed Kenya Wildlife Service officer, the group starts their walk led by the lodge’s naturalist who decides where and when to make a stopover. \nVisitors also get a chance to watch and learn more about different types of wildlife, how they co-exist among themselves and their survival tactics. \nFor instance, one gets a chance to learn that elephants normally die more of starvation. This is because they shed their teeth six times in their life spun. \nSaid Benson Maina, a naturalist working with the lodge says: “After shedding teeth for the sixth time, a jumbo is left toothless, a thing that forces it to spend the rest of its life in swampy areas so that it can feed on tender vegetation.” advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T10:22:41.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
