The document provides an update on Air Canada's performance during 2014 in four key areas of sustainability: safety, the environment, employee well-being, and the company's community involvement. For the first time, Air Canada retained a third-party auditor to assure select indicators in the report to independently verify the company's disclosure. \n\"Air Canada has long demonstrated corporate social responsibility through our commitment to safety, our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, by ensuring the well-being of our employees and in giving back to our communities,\" said Calin Rovinescu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada. \"But beyond this, we also want to make it easier for stakeholders to objectively evaluate our company in this area. Citizens of the World does this by reporting on our sustainability activities during the year and making commitments for the next year that we will duly report on. \n\"This is our fourth edition of Citizens of the World, and each year we have built upon previous reports to provide a fuller narrative and a more quantified description of our activities. To take our sustainability reporting a step further, for the first time this year we also obtained third party assurance on select indicators to better validate the information contained in the report. As a result, more comprehensively than ever, Citizens of the World 2014 informs our stakeholders and gives them a means to evaluate our sustainability performance.\" \nAir Canada's 2014 corporate sustainability report is available at www.aircanada.com/csr . It was prepared in accordance with principles of the Global Reporting Initiative, an internationally recognized standard for sustainability reporting. The report is framed around the findings of an extensive stakeholder survey undertaken in 2014 to identify areas of most concern with respect to sustainability. It also contains a discussion of governance practices at Air Canada and tables of data quantifying the results of our sustainability activities. Highlights of 2014 include: \n• Lost Time Injuries declined 11.4 percent from the previous year, the fourth straight year of decline, and total injuries were down 10 per cent from a year ago. \n• Successful completion of the biennial IATA Operational safety audit (IOSA) \n• More than 11,000 tonnes of fuel or 35,229 tonnes of CO2 (equivalent) were saved through fuel efficiency initiatives. \n• $445 million was contributed to company pension plans. \n• The Air Canada Foundation raised $1.4 million, a 45 percent increase from 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T03:36:37.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
