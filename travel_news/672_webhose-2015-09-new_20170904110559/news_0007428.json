Tooth fixed, I’m back on board in time for lunch and the afternoon shore excursion. Thanks, Janos.\nI didn’t want to be a casualty, not when there are ancient monuments to marvel at, cobbled streets to tread, quaint towns to photograph, wines to taste, and the footsteps of the famous to follow. The passengers on Avalon Waterways’ Poetry II may be grey(ish) but we are off the boat and on to the shore at every opportunity.\nThe excursions fill most mornings and afternoons; some are included, others are optional extras. The only problem is too many choices: in Burgundy, do we visit the fairytale Chateau Cormatin or the cellars of chardonnay; near Avignon, the legacy of the popes or the legacy of the Romans? Decisions, decisions.\nWhatever you decide, you have the satisfaction of working off the buffet meals and our chef’s five-course a la carte evening meals, which never repeat a dish. (Janos welcomed us aboard with, “you will be fed seven times a day”. It sounded more threat than promise.)\nOn the other hand, it is a holiday. You can always choose to stay on board, roll back the floor-to-ceiling glass doors of your elegant suite, relax and watch the south of France float by in wide screen and HD: vine-clad hillsides, quaint hamlets of time-stained stone and terra cotta – and the occasional string of red and white power pylons.\nOne night, towards the end of our journey, the view changes to families relaxing on the bank, the reflections of brightly lit alfresco restaurants dissolving in the river as white swans float by on cue and the black and gold roof of a chateau appears in glimpses through the tree tops.\nOf course, we are not the first tourists to discover this part of the world. The Romans arrived a couple of millennia ago, and liked it so much they booked in for the next 500 years. Our schedule is tighter.\nAnd the Romans are still here, at least in stone and marble. They greet us at our first port, Arles. Our guide Joanne leads us into a small street of shuttered, three-storey houses framing a view of an imposing 20,000-seat Roman amphitheatre. Lions and Christian martyrs being now in short supply, these days the amphitheatre hosts bullfights.\nIn Arles, the ancient artefacts are still surfacing – literally. Joanne says a construction team rebuilding the Rhone River embankment near our berth, recently fished up a marble head of Emperor Julius Caesar dating from 44BC. It was Caesar who famously said of France: “I came, I saw, I conquered.”\nSuccess was not so swift for Vincent van Gogh; during 15 months in Arles he did 200 paintings and, according to Joanne, sold just one. But he painted some of his best-known work there. The actual Yellow House, just a short walk from our berth, may now be unrecognisable, but The Night Cafe is unmissable, even in the strong light of day\nWe farewell van Gogh in Arles, but meet the Romans’ legacy time and again on our 470km journey north up the Rhone and Soane rivers, and never more strikingly than at the elegantly beautiful temple of Augustus and Livia in Vienne. Our guide says there was once a legend on the temple acknowledging “Augustus son of the divine”, but now the only sign I see is: “No entry except residents.”\nThe cruise is not all high culture. At night, we are treated to local entertainers such as the flamenco-style Guitars of the Camargue and, from Vienne, chanteuse Dany channelling Edith Piaf. And there’s always dancing to our resident pianist, Mari, whose repertoire includes tunes from Neil Diamond’s all-too-appropriate Hot August Night . We’re the right vintage to find that pretty cool.\nThe itinerary also offers wine tasting among the vineyards of Chateauneuf du Pape near Avignon and the cellars of chardonnay near Macon in Burgundy.\nAnd when not eating and drinking on board, you can always socialise ashore – as a group of us do one evening with hundreds of locals spilling out of cafes and bars along Vienne’s buzzing Cours Marc-Antoine Brillier and, more discreetly, outside a little cafe in the quiet streets of the small medieval town of Viviers. That followed a short organ recital in Viviers’ Cathedral where, after two sedate 17th-century pieces, the organist took aim at the vaulted ceilings with the rollicking theme from Pirates of the Caribbean .\nBut back to the history lesson: after the Romans left, the French set about preparing the countryside of Provence and Burgundy for the river cruise boom of the 21st century. It took them 1500 years, but what a great job they’ve done: sculpting hillsides with bright green rows of vines, crowning hilltops with majestic fortresses (such as Les Baux, not far from Arles.) crafting magical towns from the middle ages (such as Perouges, outside Lyon, where you’d expect a musketeer, or even three, to leap from any window) – and so much more – and all on our itinerary.\nThose centuries of preparation are certainly paying off: the river cruise business is booming. The Poetry II ’s captain, Julien Capon, says there are now more than two dozen passenger ships on the Rhone, double that of 2008, climbing through the 15 locks to our final port Chalon-sur-Saone, 162m above the Mediterranean. Avalon Waterways, is adding new ships as fast it can build them – and crew them with service that’s attentive to the point of obsessive. (I saw a crew member vacuuming the ceiling in the reception area ... and not once but twice.)\nWe were, by the way, mostly Australians, Kiwis and Americans. A show of hands among 82 passengers revealed many had cruised Europe’s river ways before, while almost a quarter of us walked straight from the Poetry II to board other Avalon cruises in Europe. Our 11-day journey had begun with a couple of nights in Monaco and ended with a couple more in Paris.\nAnd the Romans? Well, their cultural contribution continues though in a different form: my abiding memories of Lyon include a Fiat 500 in truly excruciating pearlescent pink.\nThe writer was a guest of Avalon Waterways.\nGO2\nSOUTH OF FRANCE\nAvalon Waterways’ 11-day itinerary from the Cote d’Azur to Paris, includes a seven-night cruise on the Rhone and Saone rivers.
