These tourists have made tourism a leading economic sector, contributing 10% of global GDP and 6% of the world’s total exports. Yet these big numbers represent more than just economic strength – they reflect tourism’s vast potential and increasing capacity to address some of the world’s most pressing challenges, including socio-economic growth, inclusive development and environmental preservation.” \nSecretary-General of UNWTO, Mr. Taleb Rifai \nFor over half a century now, tourism has been constantly expanding and at an even faster pace than international trade. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation predicts that this trend would today appear to be irreversible with international arrivals recording over a billion tourists worldwide and predictions of reaching 1.6 billion in 2020. \nAlthough the traditional popular destinations still dominate the ranks; the Asian continent together with the newly industrialized countries have created a market of inquisitive tourists who are improving in numbers at a faster rate than the global average. For these countries where economic activity is often based on a handful of sectors of activity, tourism provides real potential for diversification. It provides valuable foreign currency exchange and government revenues through taxation and can be a major source of employment as well as a vehicle of economic and social progress. \nAs the theme ‘One Billion Tourists: One Billion Opportunities’ indicates, focus on the opportunities and challenges increase for contemporary society. This growth launches a challenge to all the sectors involved in this global phenomenon: tourists, businesses, governments and local communities and of course the environment. Thus the billion tourists should necessarily be considered above all in their billion opportunities. \nThe United Nations World Tourism Organization has launched this year's World Tourism Day (WTD) campaign, highlighting the transformative potential of one billion tourists. \nIn keeping with the expectations of the UNWTO, the Economics Department of the University of Colombo together with the Sri Lanka Tourism development Authority have made all arrangement to spark conversation surrounding the impact tourism can have on a global scale, such as its ability to drive inclusive development, create jobs and build sustainable societies.
