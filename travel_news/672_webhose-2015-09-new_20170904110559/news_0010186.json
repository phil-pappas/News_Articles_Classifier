They bring with them their Son-In-Law Leon who has been in the Hotel business for 14 years, 10 as a Manager.\nBoth Lisa and Richard come from a management background with a customer focus, so understand about people management, and managing customer expectations. Leon compliments this with his solid background in Hotel Management\nAs a focal point of the town, these new owners want to engage with local people, and hope that their family orientated view will do just that. They plan to start quiz nights and have installed BT Sport for the local sports fans of the town. Extending further afield, they want to provide corporate customers with good quality accommodation at a reasonable cost.\nWith easy access to the A14/A12 for the East/South East of England , Needham Market is a picturesque Market town that will give business travelers a relaxing break form the daily work grind. Travelers, both Leisure and Corporate can expect a warm family friendly welcome from the new owners.\nThe new owners recently hosted their first wedding, which was a real success. They had nothing but praise from the Bride and Groom, and their family members regarding the day, the food, and evening entertainment. The Limes has a Civil marriage license, so can cater for all wedding requirements, including a recently renovated bridal suite. This is complimented by the large function room at the back of the Hotel which can cater for up to 150 people for weddings and other such events\nApproximately 18 months ago all 11 accommodation rooms were updated to a high specification, and the new owners plan to expand on this with refurbishment plans for the downstairs areas, bringing a new restaurant and tea room to the Hotel. The menus are also being updated for both the bar and restaurant, and will be launched soon, giving greater variety.\nWith Christmas on its way, the Hotel is already taking bookings for Xmas Parties and New Years Eve .\nThere are also plans to bring other events to the Hotel focused around the large event room so watch this space.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201509027979&Transmission_Id=201509021321PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201509027979&DateId=20150902"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:07:39.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
