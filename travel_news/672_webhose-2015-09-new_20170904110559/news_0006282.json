Here’s the nine things you should keep in your gym bag to get the most out of your workout.\n1. Tea Bags — They absorb moisture and can take the sting out of unwanted odours. You don’t want to be pulling your phone out of your bag on the train and turn the carriage into a scene from a horror film involving spontaneous combustion. I suggest peppermint tea or whatever you regularly love drinking. Just pop a few in your bag with your smelly clothes and they’ll work like magic.\n2. Body Shammy — A small thin microfibre towel the size of a tea towel is a definite backup. It is all you need if you gym has a ‘no towel no lift’ policy or you trained harder than you expected and are in desperate need of a shower.\n3. Tennis or Massage/Trigger Point Ball — These can replace a large foam roller and I believe do a better job at releasing fascia and trigger points. This should be done pre and post workout.\n4. Spare Undies — Always have a spare pair on top of the pair you pack to wear after your shower. How many times do you miss your undies and have to go commando?!\n5. Baby Wipes/Body Wipes — These are basically a shower without getting wet! If you are in a rush or had a smaller workout and don’t quite need a full shower but want to rub some excess oil and sweat from the underarms, or if you get back from the office after a lunchtime workout and are still sweating … Lifesaver!\nTim Robards knows a thing or two about what to take to the gym — he does it every day. Source: News Limited\n6. Protein/Nutrition Bar — If you are running on empty when you get to the gym, sometimes that little kick can be a all you need. Something with some protein, nuts and my favourite is coconut. A small hit of some slow burning fats and protein to put something in your belly but not spiking your sugar to have you crash later. They’re also handy if you’re finished your workout and don’t have access to any food for a few hours. You want to take advantage of the window where your body is up-taking protein and replenishing glycogen stores.\n7. Spare Headphones — A spare pair of cheap ones to complement your favourites. Your favourites move around with you from planes to outdoor runs etc. Don’t be caught out without your tunes to boost the intensity of your workouts! Its also stops you getting bothered by chit chat and the Don Juans in the gym.\n8. Skipping Rope — Jumping rope is a great warm up and fires up the posterior chain, meaning your spinal stabilisers are fired up to protect you from injuring yourself after sitting in the office all day. Also a great cardio workout when the treadmill just isn’t cutting it.\nSkipping rope is not just for kids and boxers — it’s a great cardio workout for anyone who wants to get fit.

A barefoot type shoe — Apart from the added benefits of connecting you better with the ground and stimulating more proprioception, thin soled barefoot shoes are great to travel with, super light and take up no space in your bag. There’s nothing worse than forgetting your gym shoes when you had all the right intentions. And it’s oh so good when you remember you have a backup!\nIf you have a size 12 foot like myself you will know that regular shoes take up half a carry bag. A barefoot type shoe is more like a ballet flat and will squash into the smallest of spaces. If you are a runner or rely on added support, I would suggest looking into forefoot running styles and working on ankle stabilising exercises. The proprioceptive information (the ability to sense stimuli and awareness about your body’s position) from your feet sets the foundation and quality of movement for the rest of the body. Much like comparing the graphics on an old Nintendo 64 with a current PlayStation 4. There is so much more detail that your feet can pick up from the environment which will help stabilise the rest of your body.\nDr Tim Robards is a Chiropractor and exercise scientist (B. Med. Sc, M.
