Mountain bikers, especially downhillers, are well aware that the character of each trail changes at different times of year. In the dry months, for example, you may have fallen leaves obscuring ruts or rocks along the way, while on any day in the monsoon season you may have fallen branches or even an entire tree blocking your path. \nBut the challenging changes brought about by the elements are no match to those created by humans. \nThe popular DH trail of Chet Khot-Pong Kon Sao Nature Study and Eco-tourism Centre in Kaeng Khoi, Saraburi, is a case in point. Like bike models, it has been modified and improved many times (by different teams of trail builders) over the past years. Let's check out the latest version. \nCredit to the new development at Chet Khot should be given to the Sathun Team, a nightlife-loving faction of the legendary Park53 group of downhillers and dirt jumpers. Sure enough, these folks did what they are good at, building jumps. \nWith members as well as other fellow riders chipping in to buy tools and dirt, the team not only repaired and rebuilt existing jumps, they also added a relatively big, and controversial, tabletop. \nAlthough it's a mild jump by Park53's standard, some feared that the new addition would be dangerous for novice downhillers. Strong conflicting opinions were posted on social media. But the Sathun team shrugged it off and continued with their work, knowing that a tabletop is a safe type of jump because any rider who is not confident to \"fly\" can just either roll over it or take the chicken run. \nAmong other new additions to the trail is a moderate gap jump with a wide leeway and a waist-high drop where trees flanking the landing are thickly padded, so much so that they look like punching bags, just in case somebody lost control because of the hard landing. This shows that the trail builders do have riders' safety in mind. \nAfter getting to try the new version of the trail, I can say that Chet Khot is now more fun. The new playthings, especially the tabletop, are great for riders to hone and improve their techniques. As a matter of fact, the tabletop and advice from the Sathun Team riders who happened to be there the day I visited literally took my jumping skill to another level. I jumped higher and farther and safer. \nChet Khot will be the venue of round two of Thailand Gravity Series 2015 taking place on Sept 19 and 20. If you plan to join the event, you still have two weeks to come and practise. Use the jumps to help you go faster instead of the other way round. \nW ell, see you here again next Thursday.
