In order to carry out cutting-edge maintenance and necessary repairs, sophisticated equipment is used to maintain the highest environmental and safety standards. \nCanada , 23 September 2015 -- \nTechnology Generates New Strategies For Large Ship Repair \nMajor advances in shipbuilding technology has influenced the techniques and strategies used to repair large-scale vessels. These advancements have drastically reduced the time needed for lay up and dock, and precision is of utmost importance. In order to carry out cutting-edge maintenance and necessary repairs, sophisticated equipment is used to maintain the highest environmental and safety standards. Because of this, service providers must be more revolutionary in their approach to ship repair. Their employees must have enhanced skills in order to perform the required maintenance on ships that increasingly use complex, automated systems. Ship repair still remains labor intensive, despite the advances in IT systems, modular fabrication methods, and robotics. Since each repair is unique, an automated solution is not always available. Ship repair companies who have access to a low cost but highly skilled labor force operate with a cost advantage due to the labor intensity of the work. Even when they can’t match their more technologically advanced competitors in terms of machinery, they retain the advantage. There is a growing trend among ship owners to be selective and dedicated when they choose a repair centre, as the decision about which service provider to select must be balanced between the degree of technical sophistication that is offered and services provided at a lower cost. In China, the cost of repair is typically lower due to more favourable prices in steel. While this is attractive, some owners may opt to pay a higher rate for service and material at ship yards providing more specialized overhaul and servicing options. Across North America, most of the work coming into ship yards is for routine maintenance work, but when on the water, location is vital. For example, on the Great Lakes Waterway there are limited choices in the US and Canada but pre-planning and building rapport with a well-equipped machine shop is advised. Facilities set on Lake Huron’s shores are abundant but the scale of repair is the determining factor, says the website run by Central Machine and Marine based in Ontario, Canada. Locating a large machine shop for repairs due to an incident on board or an equipment breakdown, the geographic location of the ship will dictate which service provider must be used. # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T02:02:24.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
