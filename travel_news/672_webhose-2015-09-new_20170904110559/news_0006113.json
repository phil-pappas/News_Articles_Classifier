Asia Asia-Pacific has clearly established itself as the industry’s largest market. In 2014 that was demonstrated by several measures: \n- International traffic to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region represented 42% of total international revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs). - Carriers registered in the Asia-Pacific region carried some 33% of total passengers - The five busiest international and domestic city-pair air routes were all in the Asia-Pacific region. \nThe information was reported in the recently released 59th Edition of the World Air Transport Statistics (WATS), the yearbook of the airline industry’s annual performance. \n“Commercial aviation is a remarkable engine for economic activity.
