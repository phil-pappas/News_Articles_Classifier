The state-of-the-art facility also includes a retail boutique and art gallery, which are designed as platforms to exhibit the work of the Maldivian and international glass artists.\nThe facility uses only waste glass materials used at Soneva resorts and other resorts in the\nMaldives. It is estimated that more than five tonnes of glass waste is produced by resorts\nin the Baa Atoll alone, every month.\n“The idea behind this project is turn the glass into something that is much more beautiful\nand valuable than it was in its previous state,” said Sonu Shivdasani, Founder and CEO of\nSoneva.\n“This is something we have wanted to do for many years, so we are very excited that the\nproject has come to fruition. We believe that small tweaks to our business model can\nmake a big difference. For instance, we see ‘waste’ as an asset rather than a liability. In\nfact, around 80% of our waste at Soneva Fushi is reused; a figure of which we are very\nproud,” he added.\nSoneva soon plans to offer unique and fun experiences to the resort guests in the form of\nspecial courses, art exhibitions, and interactive events. Several glass exhibitions will be\nheld every year in collaboration with a rotating programme of visiting artists, the first of\nwhich will be announced soon. Guests will also have the opportunity to see world-\nrenowned artists at work, buy beautiful pieces of art and also learn how to blow glass.\nThe studio will produce items used at the resort’s restaurants, as well as elements for the\narchitectural design at new and existing Soneva resorts and private residences. Each of\nSoneva’s restaurants will also get its own signature lines of custom-made plates, bowls\nand glasses. All products will reflect the company’s signature design style.\n“We are creating beautiful and functional products as well as rare pieces of art. We are\nalso hoping that this facility will stimulate the Maldivian art scene, as we aim to both\nnurture the talents of Maldivian artists and provide a platform for them to get\nrecognition,” said Kevin Christison, Soneva’s Curator of Art.\n“Although we have just opened, visitors to the island have been very fascinated by the\nglass facility. Some of the guests have already had some glass-blowing training and have\nreturned home with personally-designed pieces of art,” Christison concluded.\nThe Studio opened in August 2015; however tours of the glass studio and glass-\nblowing lessons will be available to guests at Soneva Fushi on request only\nfrom October 2015 onwards.\nSoneva Fushi inspires the imagination with 57 spacious, multi-bedroom luxury beach\nfront villas that are hidden among dense foliage for ultimate privacy. Intuitive service is\nprovided by Mr./Ms. Friday personal butlers who know what you want before you want it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:20:02.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
