Author: Thomas Piketty Related articles Piketty’s fix for inequality in sync with development plan Poor education is the root cause of inequality THE article by Raymond Parsons ( Piketty’s fix for inequality in sync with development plan , September 23) shows Prof Parsons either did not read or did not understand the recent column by Gavin Keeton ( Poor education is the root cause of inequality , September 17).\nWhen Thomas Piketty’s book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, was first published, The Economist, The Financial Times and The Spectator all wrote reviews showing that not only his conclusions but his data were flawed.\nProf Keeton showed that Prof Piketty’s conclusions on income inequality, flawed as they are, hold no validity in SA. While the disparity between the average income of the richest 10% and the poorest 10% is high, wealth did not contribute to such inequality. Statistics SA attributes 18% of the income of the richest households to what it calls \"imputed rent\" — not actual income at all.\nPensions and \"other\" income provide only 6% of income, and \"income from work\" makes up 76% of the income of the top 10%. At most, income from wealth (read savings) contributes only 6%, so Prof Piketty’s underlying assumption that a global wealth tax would reduce the income of the top 10% and so reduce income inequality is shown to be ludicrous. The top 10% would continue to be in the top 10% because their income arises from wage earnings.\nFor the poor to catch up, we need education and fewer restrictions on the economy. A recent World Bank report showed SA has one of the highest tax burdens in the world, as just 350,000 people, or 0.9% of the working-age population, contribute 44.3% of all personal income taxes. Perhaps Prof Parsons can give us his thoughts on that?\nB Carter\nVia e-mail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:59:00.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
