He says: “As a former seafarer, I always make sure each cruise features ports that I know have plenty to offer, with the opportunity to get out and explore the local area, and really get the most out of each destination.” In January 2016 the company’s smallest ship, Saga Pearl II, will set off for its biggest adventure yet – a full circumnavigation of South America. There won’t be any flying required either, with the ship sailing out of, and returning to, Southampton. “We’ve created a 73-night itinerary, full of natural attractions, man-made wonders and culture,” says James. We’ve made sure there’s the option to be as action packed or relaxed as they like during the voyage Intrepid cruisers will be able to visit the rainforests of Panama to meet the Embera Indians, see the unique wildlife of the Galápagos, the buzz of Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, and spend a day ashore in the Falklands. Of course there will also be laid-back pursuits on offer, including five days visiting the beautiful islands of the Caribbean. “It’s going to be a remarkable voyage,” explains James. “One of the benefits of cruising is you get to visit far more destinations than you ever could by land. “And whether travellers want to soak up the sun on unrivalled beaches, get up close to the vast glaciers of the Patagonian ice fields or explore rainforests in Colombia, we’ve made sure there’s the option for passengers to be as action packed or relaxed as they like during the voyage.” He adds: “When you factor in the high levels of service and comfort our guests receive on Saga’s ships, it’s easy to see why the cruises are so popular.” For the latest travel news, sign up to the fortnightly Saga Navigator newsletter , or follow @SagaHolidaysUK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T16:27:54.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
