The leafy glade edging the rushing creek remains pristine, and open for campers (though water is turned off for the season). Tuesday, only one tent and one trailer occupied the 21-site campground.\nNot-so-good news about two of your favorite Newhalem-area trails — but take heart. Ranger Katy Hooper offered words of comfort to you and other longtime visitors worried about the favorite Trail of the Cedars and Ladder Creek Falls trails. While both had fire damage, it’s recoverable, she said.\nAt Ladder Creek Falls, “there some damage but not a considerable amount…there is still a lot of green there.”\nAfter the Washington wildfires \nThe region’s first, best hope for recovery? A surge of autumn visitors. We find out what's open, what's damaged, and what travelers should expect in Central Washington. A stop by the temporarily gated Skagit River suspension bridge that leads to the Ladder Creek area confirmed that: At a distance, we saw lots of big green trees and no visible burn damage.\nAt Trail of the Cedars, “There are some trees that were lost but none of those huge cedars people think of when they think of this trail,” Hooper said.\nTo reader Aaron Meadows-Hills, of Ballard, no worries about your future plans to camp at the park’s Colonial Creek Campground, on Diablo Lake: It’s miles east of Newhalem and the fires didn’t get near it. Do note that it’s now mostly closed for the season except for 10 walk-in, tent-only campsites edging the lake, with no running water. Nice, if you like quiet.\nReaders: Toss me more questions about the North Cascades and Central Washington areas stricken by wildfires and I’ll try to answer this week as I travel the Cascade Loop.
