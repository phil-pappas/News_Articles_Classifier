India, like any other country has geographic divisions. In a broad aspect, it is divided into the Northern half and the Southern half. With its culture, customs, architecture and habitat the two divisions are poles apart. The language is different too. Though most of all southern states have working knowledge of English, Hindi, the National language of the country is not spoken at all. All four states speak four different languages, yet they are bound by similar traditions and customs. This is where the uniqueness of diversity emerges and appeals to the rest of the world. People in the southern states are more mellowed and appear humble than their northern counterparts. This epiphany hits the traveller as soon as one sets foot into the country. If the visitor has already been to North India, this is more palpable.\nThere is so much to see and experience in South India. The coastal area of Kerala, with it swaying palms and intimate breeze captivates the visitor with an effortless ease. Its languorous backwaters and innumerable canals have earned it the nickname of 'The Venice of the East'. Kerala's tranquil breeze and mellowed charm soothes the weary but eager traveller right away. Compared to the rest of the country, Kerala scores in the hygiene factor as well. Lack of shantytowns and organized garbage disposal contributes to this pristine surrounding. Though it is famous for its backwaters and Houseboat tours, the remnants of a rich Jewish and Portuguese culture is hard to ignore.\nCompass India Pvt.

Though petty crimes occur in any part of the world and no one can provide a cent percent guarantee for safety.\nRelics of the Nizam's rule dot the city of Hyderabad, another gateway of the South. A strong Mughal influence permeated into the city's cuisine. The Hyderabadi Biryani, a mughlai dish made with rice and meat, and Haleem are famous worldwide. Qutb Shah built the noted mosque Charminar, standing tall at 56 meters at the heart of the city. It was built the mosque to commemorate the eradication of plague.
