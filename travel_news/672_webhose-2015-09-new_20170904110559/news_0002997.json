On the internet? Oh my God, I'd be sunk.\" But while Hunt may find it difficult to decipher the language and adhere to the rules of online dating , new research suggest thats he may be part of a shrinking minority. The Colour Report found that 19 per cent of retirees have tried online dating, with 30 per cent admitting they had been successful. This is 10 per cent higher than Match.com 's claim that one in five of their matches (from all age groups) end in a successful relationship. With divorce rates rising amongst the over-45s , online dating is becoming more alluring to the older generation, but it's not as simple as it seems. When 52-year-old Cheryl divorced her husband of 19 years she felt anxious and nervous at the prospect of re-entering the dating pool, though that was eclipsed by her \"burning need to feel wanted and attractive to someone.\" Cheryl, like thousands of other women , is a self-professed cougar . At first, she tried the 'traditional' dating route, but found none of her dates with her agemates ended positively: \"They were all men my age or older and, quite frankly, I wasn't really ready to date so soon after my divorce.\" In The Graduate, a 21-year-old Dustin Hoffman is seduced by an older woman Photo: Rex Fresh from her divorce and not wanting anything serious, her desire to feel wanted led her to look at younger men as potential partners: \"I felt they would be a safer choice in the sense that they, typically, aren't looking for a serious committed relationship.\" \"Younger men have a drive and stamina that men my age don't have,\" Cheryl says, \"they aren't 'broken', they aren't angry and bitter towards women after nasty divorces or child custody battles. They're still naive and innocent, in a good way. They don't expect marriage or children from me, and I don't expect it from them either.\" I don't want the same security and routine I was looking for when I married. Now I want variety and fun, I want to enjoy the connections while they last and move on Sarah Symonds, author and relationship coach , celebrates the rise of the cougar: \"In today's society, women are choosing to become more like men in their actions. They are more laddish and aggressive, hence why going after a younger man is the norm for many women now - just as men pursuing younger women always was - and still is. \"Plus, with more older women keeping themselves in shape these days and staying sexually active, and more older or middle aged men letting themselves go , is it any wonder that women are choosing to go after younger, handsome models?\" Like Cheryl, Symonds cites the lack of \"emotional baggage\" younger men tend to have as the reason older women find them attractive: \"Younger men are just fun, without any of the hard work.\" Demi Moore was with Ashton Kutcher, 15 years her junior, for 10 years Photo: Reuters For Cheryl, the lack of commitment offered by younger men is crucial to the success of their relationship: \"I don't want the same security and routine I was looking for when I married. Now I want variety and fun, I want to enjoy the connections while they last and move on. That's not to say I still don't desire love, I am human after all, but even that word has taken on an entirely different meaning to me at this point in my life. \"The biggest challenge I face now is that it is quite difficult not to catch 'feelings' of attachment on my part.\" Post divorce, Cheryl's first relationship with a younger man (\"I discovered later that he was not 27 as I assessed, but only 22\") ended once significant feelings began to develop between them: \"Our very passionate love affair lasted six months. I tried to remain neutral, knowing we were not in the same places in life and we weren't in it for the long term, so when feelings began to run deep and our relationship escalated, I ran. \"Our break-up was painful for the both of us, but our love for each other runs so deep we remain good friends who do anything for each other, to this day.\" 47 years on from Mike Nichols' award winning ' The Graduate ', and just months after the final episode of Courteney Cox's ' Cougar Town ', the idea of actually being a cougar is becoming more common in todays society, though experts say it is still not totally accepted. Jennifer Lopez, 46, was dubbed a cougar for her on-and-off relationship with Casper Smart, 28 Photo: Rex Lucia, ' The #1 Cougar dating expert ', says there is still a double standard when it comes to these types of relationships: \"Men who date younger women are applauded and are seen as 'having game', but older women are called 'desperate' or 'pathetic' or they're told they're trying to hold on to their youth. \"No one bats an eye when a man is dating someone much younger , but if a man is dating someone much older, people assume it's only for her money. If women date younger men, they have to maintain their sex appeal, whereas this is not required for men who are dating a younger woman - think J-Lo as opposed to Hugh Hefner .\" \"Cougar relationships are still not totally accepted in society, but it's not as much of a taboo as it was a few years ago. Although it will never been the norm, it will become more acceptable as time goes by. In the end, it's not about the age, it's about two people who are attracted to each other, feel a connection, and want to be together.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T10:19:06.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
