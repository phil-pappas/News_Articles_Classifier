It lost that designation in 1998, but unless you're taking a little trip to Taipei or Kuala Lampur any time soon, the Willis Tower is certainly the tallest skyscraper you're likely to visit. \nBut regardless of its architectural stature, there's one thing without a doubt -- the Willis Tower Skydeck offers the best and most amazing views in Chicago. On a crystal clear day, you can see into four states -- Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin -- as the range of view is 40 - 50 miles (65 - 80 kilometers). It's absolutely breathtaking. Do you remember the first time you looked out the window of an airplane, and your mind could hardly process the idea that you were that far up in the sky? The Skydeck is a similar experience. \nAs if the view weren't enough of an attraction, the Willis Tower Skydeck went through a $4 million renovation, and added the following: The Ledge - four glass boxes that let you take in the view straight down Interactive Chicago history exhibits Multi-language (English, French, German, Japanese, Polish and Spanish) kiosks that guide you through a tour of Chicago landmarks Knee-High Chicago, a \"kid-level\" display that teaches kids about Chicago sports and history High-powered telescopes \nIf you truly want a bird's eye view (actually, I don't even know if birds get up that high!) of the Chicagoland area, then pay a visit to the Willis Tower Skydeck, you won't regret it. \nMake sure to visit our Architecture guide for more Willis/Sears Tower architecture facts . \nThe Skydeck is included with the purchase of a Chicago City Pass .
