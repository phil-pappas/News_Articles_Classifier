If you were lucky, you'd get a snack bar with limited fast food options, a sundries shop with candy and chips and a bland, generic restaurant. But now airports, knowing that passengers are spending more time in their facilities, have stepped up their game and offer local/regional and national brands ranging from fast food to full-service restaurants. Below are 10 quick-serve outlets you should try on your next trip.\nflaneur/Flickr/CC BY 2.0 1. Vino Volo, 12 airport locations This is one of my favorite airport concessions of all time. And one of the reasons (besides the great wine selection) is their small snack plates. I cannot get enough of the cured olives and the Marcona almonds, which have a lovely hint of rosemary.

While at this outpost with a lot of time to kill, not only did I have a chopped brisket sandwich for lunch, I also took some pulled pork for the journey home. More »\n3. Comida Buena, Albuquerque International Sunport When I told a friend I was going to Albuquerque, she said that when I was leaving, I should add in extra time to get the green chicken chile soup here. She was right. There are also some great southwest-style sandwiches to choose from. More »\n4. Café La Carreta, Miami International Airport I always get my Cuban food fix on at this outpost of one of the city’s most popular restaurants. I get the Cuban pressed sandwich, fried plantains and Cuban coffee, and I’m good to go! More »\n5. Currito, Boston Logan International Airport This is not your father’s burritos stand. They not only offer the traditional Mexican burritos, but they also have Cajun, Mediterranean and Asian options. More »\n6. Surdyk’s Flights, Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport This outpost of the city’s Surdyk’s Liquor and Cheese Shop offers a great selection of wines by the glass, along with tasty small plates and great gourmet sandwiches. More »\n7. Nuts on Clark, Chicago Midway Airport A few years ago, I attended an airport concessions conference in Chicago. At the end of the conference, we were given a tour — and samples — of the airport’s best. I had the popcorn here and fell in love. No lie – I actually will schedule a stopover at Midway if it works in my travel plans to get this popcorn. They have an outpost at O’Hare too. More »\n8. California Tortilla, Washington-Dulles International Airport This outlet serves a great variety of TexMex burritos, tacos, fajitas, quesedillas and salads, along with chips and a fantastic selection of hot sauces. My favorite is the Korean BBQ, but I also recommend the Crunchy BBQ Ranch Chicken Burrito. Ole! More »\n9. Deep Blue Sushi On The Fly, JFK Airport, Terminal 5 I’m a big fan of the food options JetBlue has in its signature terminal. I’m a big sushi lover, and I always go to the carry-out version of this great restaurant. Splurge a little on one of their signature rolls. I’m partial to the King Crab California Roll, myself! More »\n10. 360 Degree Burritos, Oakland International Airport You can get your food as burrito, a wrap, a salad, a quesadilla, a bowl or a sandwich, all of which are convenient for airport travel. They have meat, vegetarian and vegan options in flavors ranging from classic to Cajun.
