Clark products at the National Hardware Show, The Grommet decided to approach parent company LCI Brands about a potential partnership. As a unique platform to launch products, The Grommet offers innovative items from independent makers, inventors, and entrepreneurs. After determining which items would best suit their audience, The Grommet set about launching Lewis N. Clark products on their site. “We work to tell the story behind every item we launch,” said Katherine Foley, Maker Programming Associate. “After reviewing and testing a product, we create a unique story through video, professional photographs, and detailed web pages. We also plan out marketing promotions and coordinate with bloggers and media outlets to build up interest.\"\nJust days after the launch, original forecasts for the Lewis N. Clark Backpacks and Duffels were far exceeded. In light of this, the Duffels and Backpacks, as well as the Sling Pack, will be offered on The Grommet Wholesale, a B2B platform serving 5,000 retailers, and in additional colorways.\n“We’re excited to be part of The Grommet Consumer and Wholesale platforms and look forward to the next steps,” said Ray Roos, Vice President of Sales.\nThe bags are available now on The Grommet’s consumer site.\nAbout LCI Brands\nLCI Brands (formerly known as L.C. Industries, Inc.) is located just outside Chicago and is home to brands such as Lewis N. Clark®, Belle Hop®, and UrbanGear™.
