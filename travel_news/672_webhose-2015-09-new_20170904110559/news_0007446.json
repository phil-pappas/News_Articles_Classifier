The primary objectives of the intelligent transportation system includes, improvement in traffic safety, improved transportation efficiency, relieving traffic congestion, air pollution reduction, promoted development of related industries and increasing energy efficiency. Explore more about Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Market: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/intelligent-transportation-system-market Based on the various systems, the global intelligent transportation system (ITS) market can be segmented as Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS), Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS), ITS-enabled Transportation Pricing System, Advanced Public Transportation System (APTS), and Commercial Vehicle Operation (CVO). The advanced traveler information system (ATIS) offers real-time traffic, weather information, and navigation. The demand for ATIS systems is expected to grow significantly during the forecast period particularly in the developed markets, where the use of ATIS is widely adopted by the automotive manufacturers. ATMS was one of the largest market sectors of the intelligent transportation systems market in 2014. The wide adoption of ATMS is attributed to the ability to optimize transportation network operations. ATMS solution consists of data processing equipment, sensors, and communication equipment, to gather the real-time information about the operation of transportation networks. APTS is the fastest growing market segment of the global intelligent transportation system (ITS). APTS is widely used for the improvement of public transit systems, traffic safety, and operations. The various applications of APTS include bus arrival notification systems, automatic vehicle location systems, and real-time passenger information systems. On the basis of various components, the global intelligent transportation system (ITS) market can be segmented as interface board, sensor, software, surveillance camera, telecommunication network, monitoring and detection system, and others. Based on various applications, the global intelligent transportation system market can be segmented as fleet management and asset monitoring, traffic monitoring system, traffic signal control system, collision avoidance system, arable traffic message sign, parking availability system, traffic enforcement camera, and automotive telematics. Geographically, North America dominated the intelligent transportation system market in 2014, and is expected to retain its dominance over the forecast period. The Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITS America) is engaged in the research and development (R&D) within intelligent transportation. The organization is also active in the deployment of ITS, in order to improve the surface transportation system across the U.S. The major ITS projects in the U.S. market include, the Advanced Regional Traffic Interactive Management and Information system (ARTIMIS), Philadelphia, Arterial Street Signal Interconnect, and PA and Georgia Navigator. Asia Pacific is the fastest growing ITS market at a lucrative double digit growth rate. The supportive government initiative, towards the implementation of ITS across several developing countries, is expected to drive the growth of intelligent transportation in the region, during the forecast period.
