With hectic timings and schedules, short break after conferences can prove to be quite a breather. With the Luxury Hotel Conference Orlando 2015 already on from 27 October- 29 October, top hoteliers are going through the busiest schedules. Barak Hirschowitz President International Luxury Hotel Association is living the success of the conference and things are moving at the right pace. There is much business on the floor and people are wasting no time to get it. The day is moving so fast that top hotel professionals are getting exhausted as day ends.\nSo what would a top travel professional like as his day comes to a close. A short break to some place where fatigue gets wiped off and the energy quotient gets restored. Just take a quick transport, to the Universal City Walk, which is a great place to go between two parks and offers a good atmosphere. The park is open till 10.00pm.\nThe old NASCAR café is going through some redevelopment, but since they are doing a good job of keeping it unobtrusive you can have some own time there. The WiFi speed is good. You can eat something from the food outlets, restaurants and shops. The boat services too on-site hotels is superb so if you are staying at one of these hotels a quick sail can help you relax while you reach your hotel. However the walkways are well maintained and can be quite calming for the mind as you enjoy your short break.\nThere are movie theaters that remain open till 2 am. So you could also see a movie to make you feel better on the last day. Emeril’s, Margaritaville are great places to eat and relax after a hard day. The Mexican restaurants, live music can make you feel alive and rejuvenated as you follow your short break after the conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:11:26.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
