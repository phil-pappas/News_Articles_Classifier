And it pays to do some research on who is the best lookalike.\nMen dressed as Russian communists Lenin (left) and Stalin (right) charge tourists in the Red Square up to £10 for a photo\nIf you want to get a memorable photo from Red Square, it's probably best to ask 'Stalin' to lay down the McDonald's fries\nWould they be turning in their graves? It's unlikely Stalin (left) and Lenin (right) would be happy with some of their imposters\nFor starters, one Stalin imposter has been pictured stuffing his face with McDonald's chips in the shadow of the Kremlin.\nThere's also a drunk 'Lenin', who struggles to focus on the camera.\n Not a beach or infinity pool in sight: The photographer who... Truly novel tourist attractions! Inside the world's most... Turkish delight! Why visitors come back again and again to... Passenger who was arrested and led off plane in handcuffs by... Sergei Solovyov, a 57-year-old Lenin impersonator told the Wall Street Journal : 'It's hard work to be on your feet all day, he said.\n'It's also morally hard. People shout: 'Burn in hell! What have you done with Russia?'\nLenin served as head of government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1917, and of the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death in 1924, Stalin took over and led the Soviet Union until 1953\nThere have also been reports of squabbles breaking out among the impersonators. One Stalin-lookalike followed a 'Lenin' into an alleyway and 'jabbed him with an umbrella' in a row over the dividing up of cash.\nRecognising the opportunity for income, the impersonating started in the 1990s, and it's believed six 'Stalins' and eight 'Lenins' now work the crowds.\nSolovyov added: '\"White Lenin\" has a pale face; \"Wooden Lenin\" doesn't say much; \"Gay Lenin\" stands with an impersonator of the poet Alexander Pushkin; \"Drunk Lenin\" likes a tipple.'\nLenin led the Bolshevik Revolution that established seven decades of Soviet rule.\nStalin succeeded him, purging millions of citizens but leading the USSR to victory in the Second World War.\nThe Russian men have a chat to discuss how their daily takings are shaping up in Red Square\nVLADIMIR LENIN Vladmir Lenin was behind the Bolshevik take-over of power in Russia in 1917. He was also the architect and first head of the USSR.\nBorn in Simbirsk, he was expelled from university for his radical policies while studying law. This prompted him to move to St Petersburg, where he became a revolutionary.\nHe was arrested and exiled to Siberia. He later spent most of his time in western Europe, where he became the leader of the 'Bolshevik' faction of the Russian Social Democratic Worker's Party.\nIn 1917, Lenin returned to Russia where he led what was to be known as the October Revolution. Around three years of civil war followed in which millions died.\nIn 1918, Lenin survived an assassination attempt, but was severely wounded. In 1922 he suffered a stroke from which he never fully recovered.\nJOSEPH STALIN Stalin was one of the seven members of the first Politburo, founded in 1917 in order to manage the Bolshevik Revolution, alongside Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotsky, Sokolnikov and Bubnov.\nAmong the Bolshevik revolutionaries who took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917, Stalin was appointed General Secretary of the party's Central Committee in 1922.\nHe subsequently managed to consolidate power following the 1924 death of Lenin through suppressing his criticisms and expanding the functions of his role, all the while eliminating any opposition.\nHe remained general secretary until the post was abolished in 1952, concurrently serving as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 onward.\nStalin remains a controversial figure today, with many regarding him as a tyrant.\nRead more: In Moscow, Lenin and Stalin Look-Alikes Jostle for Tourists’ Cash - WSJ", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-moscow-lenin-and-stalin-look-alikes-jostle-for-tourists-cash-1443407794", "http://dailym.ai/1O4NhXD"], "published": "2015-09-28T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:27:11.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
