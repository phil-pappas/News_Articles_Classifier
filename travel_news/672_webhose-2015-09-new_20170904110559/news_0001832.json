The launch of the website is part of ACTA’s marketing toolkit that was created to provide our members with a collection of resources to promote the value proposition of a Travel Agent. Visitors to the website receive helpful advice, tips and fun stories for travellers planning or embarking on their next vacation.\nTo support the launch of the website ACTA introduced “Why I Use My Travel Agent Contest” sponsored by WestJet. ACTA encouraged its members to solicit their clients for testimonials to share why they use a Travel Agent, and the value that their Travel Agent provides them when travel planning. Each testimonial submitted was eligible to win a pair of air only tickets anywhere WestJet flies. A pair for the participating Travel Agent and a pair for their client who wrote the testimonial. The contest closed on July 31, 2015.\nMary Jane Hiebert, Chair of ACTA stated “It was very exciting to see the response to the contest. What a great opportunity to share stories and be reminded of the great value that Travel Agents offer. There were amazing testimonials submitted. Special thanks to WestJet for working with us on this project.”\nLyell Farquharson, WestJet Vice-President, Sales and Business Development said, “WestJet has a long-standing relationship with Travel Agent partners across Canada and beyond, and we credit you for fully supporting us through a 19 year history together, by participating in this initiative we continue to work to make WestJet a value and experience-based choice for travel professionals in recognition of the important part Travel Agents play.”\nOver 150 submissions were received and only one winner chosen. To choose the winner a team at ACTA weeded down the entries to a “top ten” which was then passed on to the team at WestJet to choose the final winner.\nOn behalf of ACTA and WestJet we are happy to announce the winner of the ‘Why I Use My Travel Agent Contest” as Marilyn Shalma of New Wave Travel in Toronto, Ontario and her client who submitted the testimonial, Brian Nixon of Toronto, Ontario. Marilyn and Brian were informed of their recent luck and a visit to Marilyn’s office was setup to present them with their prizes. Photographed below Fiona Bowen, ACTA ON Regional Manager, and Matt Djorsev, WestJet Agency Sales, Ontario and Manitoba were on hand to share the moment with the happy winners.\nACTA feels that by adding bookwithatravelagent.ca to the ACTA member toolkit we can continue to encourage ACTA members to take advantage of the content available to promote their value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T01:52:15.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
