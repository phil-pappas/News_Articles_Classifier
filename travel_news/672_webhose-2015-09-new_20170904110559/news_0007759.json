Chef, rum ambassador and author of the cookbook Infusion! Spirited Cooking , Chef Paul debuts his Rhum Bar & Caribbean Kitchen in Charleston, South Carolina, this Fall. Here he talks rum, rum and more rum—and a bit of cuisine to go with it. Why the love of rum? What's not to love? I grew up on the island of Barbados, by many accounts the birthplace of the rum industry as we know it, home of the oldest rum brand on earth—Mount Gay—as well as some of the most decorated rum brands on the market. It’s part of the island and its peoples’ DNA—sugar is everywhere. Rums can affect the very fabric of space and time. I know this because when I’m with good company and drink rum, all of a sudden it’s 3 in the morning! Rum has a story and history that almost no other spirit can lay claim to. As my friend Ian Williams—he’s the author of a famous book about rum—writes, “rum was the lubricant and fuel for the whole engine of commerce that made the modern world.” Explain that Quote: by being a rum professor and sharing some little-known facts about the spirit’s history. One of the first mentions of rum in any written history dates to 326 BC, during Alexander the Great’s invasion of India. A scribe records that they had a drink made from “honey that came from reeds without bees.” The first Sugar Cane in the new world was brought from the Canary Islands to Hispaniola by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the new world in 1493—and the crop failed at first because planting and harvesting techniques were not understood. It instead took off in Brazil, which had enormous tracts of land in the sixteenth century, and it was re-introduced to the Caribbean by Portuguese Jews fleeing persecution and settling in Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and the Bahamas. And finally, note this: the making of rum is like the making of people. Both require time and patience, but also the ability to be aware of maturity over age. Age is a measure of time, while maturity reflects what the rum (or person) has learned—picked up and absorbed. This forms the quality of the end result. How does this complicated history explain why there are so many different kinds of rum? It’s connected to colonization on each island. The English/Scottish/Irish method’s roots—the British colonized Barbados, for instance—are in the making of Scotch whiskey, and an aging process that allows for a “mash”: fermentation, distillation, evaporation and a more intense product. The Spanish method’s roots are in the making of Sherry and Brandy; while they also use molasses, they use a unique aging system called Solera that blends different ages. And of course the French method—they colonized Martinique, among other islands—has roots in Cognac, fermenting and distilling the raw sugarcane juice, not the molasses, to create Rhum Agricole, which is more earthy, more robust, much less sweet. Is rum an underrated spirit? From a market standpoint, based on sales compared to vodka, yes. Rum comes second. But the number-one sold mixed drink in the world is rum and coke. The number-one alcohol brand is Bacardi, and according to Drinks International , a leading industry magazine, this year 14 out of 50 of the best-selling concoctions were rum based. I think it’s accurate to say, without prejudice, that rum is rising in popularity and as consumers become more educated as to brands, variety and amazing tastes, it’ll surpass vodka sales.[vimeovid id=\"35923035\"] What’s your favorite rum? That’s like asking me to name my favorite food: It depends on mood. After all, we aren’t talking about vodka here—that odorless, colorless, triple-distilled stuff that people think is so attractive. Apologies, but rum is just sexier . It comes in enough varieties to match all of your moods: frisky, mellow, party-ready, meditative—the whole nine yards. It ends up being a matter of personal taste, yes, but permit me to submit two critical rum rules: First, thou shalt not mix a quality 15-year-old rum with diet soda—this is a crime! And second, with rum—as with people—maturity is more important than age. Age is a measure of time while maturity reflects what the rum (or person!) has picked up and absorbed, ultimately impacting the quality of the final result. Fair enough. So how about your favorite rums to drink on the beach? Mount Gay Silver: clean taste, mixes subtly into frozen and blended drinks like Pina Coladas and Mojitos. Old Brigand (RL Seale) is a perfect mixing rum, made to start a relationship with ice and coke and elope with both of them. Pusser's is the chosen rum of the English Navy for over 300 years now and grog is the world’s first cocktail, invented by adding fresh water and lime juice to a glass of rum. Favorite rums to drink with a meal? Depends on what the meal is. I prefer to have a mixed rum drink before (Mount Gay Black Barrel and coke), a well-balanced rum cocktail during (a Foursquare dirty Mojito) and a premium-aged, smooth, toffee-finished sipping rum after (El Dorado 15 on the rocks). Favorite distilleries in the Caribbean? Clement (Martinique), Barbancourt (Haiti), Mount Gay (Barbados), Foursquare (Barbados), Hampden Estate (Jamaica), St. Nicholas Abbey (Barbados). Any new rums worth knowing about? Red Harbour is a Charleston-based company/distillery that purchases aged rum from Barbados and mixes it with local rum distilled from Caribbean-sourced molasses. The Real McCoy is a rum brand based on the real-life account of William McCoy, an American rum runner and smuggler during prohibition who was an honest trader—he kept an honest business, didn’t pay off police or organized crime or dilute his booze—he sold it full strength: It was the “real McCoy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T15:35:09.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
