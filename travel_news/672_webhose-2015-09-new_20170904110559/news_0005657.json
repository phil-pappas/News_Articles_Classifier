As Dame Carol Black, chair of the Britain’s Healthiest Company advisory group and a health adviser to successive governments, argues: \"A healthy workforce is productive and happy. That's good news for employers. And it's good news for the country, because it helps the economy and improves the population's well-being.\" So there are incentives for businesses to look after staff. These tips draw on insights from Britain's Healthiest Company 2015. 1 Value health and well-being It starts with the simplest of steps. \"Establish a positive culture, in which employees are encouraged to live well, and you'll see the health of your people improve as they acquire new habits,\" says Tricia Kalloo, chief executive of Wellness International. She should know: adidas (UK), for whom her company provides an in-house employee plan, has won awards every year since Britain's Healthiest Company was launched in 2013. 2 Talk to staff Some companies are good communicators and 77 per cent of participants this year reported using initiatives at work such as letters and cards to staff encouraging healthy living. These do change attitudes - more than half of those surveyed said they recognised a need to lose weight, and a similar proportion wanted to exercise regularly. 3 Provide the right facilities It’s all very well promoting fitness but it's even better if you provide the environment. Award-winners such as Old Mutual provide showers and changing rooms. Others, such as adidas (UK), provide on-site gyms. \"Even if you can't afford to offer sports facilities, you can give staff flexibility so tehy have time to work out during the day,\" says Mercer's head of corporate consulting, Chris Bailey. 4 Bring in the top team If you want healthier staff, you need to engage the decision-makers. That’s the view of Neville Koopowitz , chief executive of VitalityHealth. He believes that Britain's healthiest companies are the ones in which senior managers are fully on board. It's also important to engage line managers. As Mercer's Chris Bailey says: \"If a supervisor makes an employee feel guilty for taking a gym break, it won't help. It's vital there's a positive attitude to well-being at every level.\" 5 offer incentives If encouragement from bosses doesn't persuade staff to improve their lifestyle, try incentives. This could be as simple as celebrating individual successes at monthly staff meetings, which is a strategy adopted by award winner Lindt. Or it could involve subsidies on fitness equipment, which Sweaty Betty does through its bike purchase scheme. 6 Look at the big picture Mental health is important too, that's why 2015 award winner Johnson & Johnson adopts a holistic approach. \"We provide tools to help employees live well and achieve more,\" says Clare Sicklen, HR director. \"Face- to-face counselling sessions are also available.\" 7 Checkpoints Just 24 per cent of respondents to the 2015 survey had been screened for cholesterol, blood pressure and glucose in the past year. Health professionals such as Dame Carol Black endorse company medical checks. \"If we can control conditions such as high blood pressure, we can keep people in work longer,\" she says. 8 Monitor performance To check the effectiveness of your company's policy, you need to measure it. Participation in Britain's Healthiest Company will help. By signing up, employees will have a chance to take part anonymously in the annual survey. Then you will receive data that tracks your performance and identifies the impact of staff wellness on productivity.
