The band had only played three concerts on the tour when the assult took place. The thief held the group up at gunpoint and stole the band’s rented vehicle, instruments, merchandise, electronic devices, luggage, cash money and passports, with an economic loss of approximately $11, 000, according to a statement released by the group on Friday.\n“I have never been so scared in all my life,” band member Ricardo Arias posted on Facebook.”I wouldn’t wish that on anyone: that resignation to the point of being ready to let go of your life.”\nDespite the setback, Overseas has decided to continue with the tour with help from local Brazilian sponsors, bands, and fans, who have been providing the group with clothing, food, lodging, and transportation. Meanwhile, the Costa Rican Consulate in Brazil is seeking a solution regarding the lost passports so that the group can either continue with the tour in Argentina and Chile as planned, or return to Costa Rica next week.\nOverseas has also launched a crowdfunding campaign through Indiegogo for fans who want to support them.\n“Without any doubt we were born again today,” Arias wrote. “I’m grateful for this second chance.”\nFor more information or to donate to the campaign, visit the Overseas Facebook page .\nContact Elizabeth Lang at elang@ticotimes.net", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/overseasofficial"], "published": "2015-09-20T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T19:53:45.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
