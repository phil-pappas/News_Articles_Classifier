During late October, Las Vegas has a frightening surprise lurking behind every corner. All events in Las Vegas are tightly controlled, particularly during Halloween, so good, safe fun is ready and waiting for all visitors! Sapphire Resorts™ Group encourages travelers to pack their costumes for their October adventure in Sin City. 1. Asylum & Hotel Fear– The Asylum and Hotel Fear, now in their 14th year of operation, open in late September and run Thursday through Sunday until Halloween. Located in the Meadows Mall area, this haunted house is guaranteed to scare everyone. The Asylum is a themed haunted house, designed as a walk-through sanitarium. Group tickets are available and children, while not encouraged, are not discouraged. Fear is an individual thing, so some children may be petrified, just like some adults. Celebrated as one of Vegas’ best haunts, this is a must-see for haunted house fans.\n2. FrightFest – Freemont Street converts itself into one large monster party during October. 2015 marks the 6th year of this combination of Oktoberfest and Halloween with live entertainment. Costumes are encouraged during this month-long street party. Entertainment on the schedule includes Frank & The Steins, Vampire Rising, and Halloween Hotties. Sapphire Resorts™ Group knows this free event is the perfect opportunity to witness Las Vegas in its element. Throughout October, free laser light shows continue throughout the evening.\n3. Fright Dome – Each year, the five-acre theme park Adventuredome transforms itself into Frightdome. With 25 rides and attractions including six new Haunted Houses, four new scare zones, and live nightly shows, this dome is set to scare even the bravest of guests. And if that’s not enough, there are over 250,000 square feet of scares and a 4-D panic house. Gore, blood, and bone-chilling fear await, children under 12 are not encouraged to attend, and the 42” height requirement for rides is still in effect. Fast pass tickets are available to jump in line, and they come with an exclusive entrance into the Isolation Haunted House. As usual, the frightful fun is found under the giant tent.\nSapphire Resorts™ Group is fearfully preparing information on all the best October happenings in Sin City.
