Sister restaurant Mark Jordan at the Beach was also re-awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand, which signifies good quality, good value cooking.\nPatrick Burke, owner of The Atlantic Hotel and Ocean Restaurant and co-owner of Mark Jordan at the Beach, commented: ‘We are delighted that Mark and his teams in both kitchens have been acknowledged again for their commitment to making Ocean Restaurant and Mark Jordan at the Beach the special venues that they are. Being recognised year after year is no mean achievement and is a reflection of Mark’s talent and the hard work and creativity of all of our chefs.’\n‘I am really proud of the brigades at Ocean Restaurant and Mark Jordan at the Beach, who work tirelessly to deliver the impeccable standards required to impress the Michelin inspectors every year. We are committed to using the freshest local ingredients to produce exciting dining experiences for our guests, and we hope to build on this success in the future,’ added executive head chef, Mark Jordan.\nOcean Restaurant specialises in modern British cooking with an emphasis on fresh local produce. The restaurant was first awarded its Michelin star status in 2007, having been singled out with a Michelin Rising Star in 2006. Mark Jordan at the Beach offers a more relaxed alternative in an informal setting and was first awarded Bib Gourmand status in 2013.\nThe Michelin ‘Red Guide’ remains the benchmark by which all UK restaurants are judged. Referred to as the Oscars of the foodie world, stars are allocated to restaurants after extensive impartial inspections.\nSource:- Jersey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T15:36:03.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
