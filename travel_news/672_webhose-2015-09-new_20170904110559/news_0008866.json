SEPT. 8, 2015 Continue reading the main story About once a month since the Napa Valley Wine Train began chugging through California ’s wine country in 1989, the sound of clinking stemware has been accompanied by the spectacle of passengers being removed from the train. Usually, the passengers are intoxicated and have become belligerent or unruly, said Anthony Giaccio, the company’s president. In the most egregious cases, the company had to remove a drunken man who tried to climb atop one of the locomotives, and a bickering couple after a verbal dispute became physical, he said. The man, he said, “probably saw too many Westerns.” As for the couple: “She wasn’t happy with him and he ended up with a fork in his skin. That’s probably one of the wildest stories I’ve heard over the years.” See More » The process seemed to work until last month, when 11 women in a book club were booted from the wine train for laughing too loud. Their treatment led to a social media debate that focused on a single question: How loud should a trip to wine country be? “If I can’t be loud while imbibing wine with a group of friends, then what’s the point?” Vicente J. Godfrey wrote in a one-star review he left on the Napa Valley Wine Train’s Facebook page amid a social media firestorm over the incident. Josh Stewart, leaving a five-star review, took a different view: “I don’t think it’s appropriate for anyone to be loud on a wine train. If this was a liquor train or a beer festival, I would understand.” Although the company has apologized to the women and offered to have them return for a trip in a private car, it also received hundreds of negative reviews on Facebook and Yelp. The book club, many of whose members are black, has retained a lawyer, Waukeen McCoy of San Francisco, who said they are considering legal options including a racial discrimination lawsuit. He said his clients want the wine train’s employees to receive diversity and sensitivity training in hopes that standards for conduct will be applied fairly across racial and ethnic lines. “They just don’t want this to happen to anyone else,” he said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The incident cast a spotlight on a recurring challenge faced by wineries and tour operators: how to police noise levels without overdoing it. It is a conundrum that curators of the wine-tasting experience have increasingly grappled with, as an industry boom that stretches back more than 20 years draws large crowds to long-established wine regions in California and New York, as well as budding production centers in northern Michigan, Virginia and elsewhere. The influx has forced wineries and tour operators to seek ways to balance the quality of a sampling session with the appropriate amount of fun. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story A decision to expel customers from a wine tour for something as normal as loud laughter can be a public relations blunder in a market that is highly competitive. The number of wineries in the United States increased to 8,287 in 2014 from 6,357 in 2009, and 47 percent are in California, according to Wines & Vines , a trade magazine. Together, they produced more than 835 million gallons of wine last year, according to the Wine Institute, an advocacy and public policy association for California wine. On a practical level, removing people for laughing is also turning away the hottest customers: Americans who are drinking more wine and paying more for it. The United States has surpassed France as the largest wine market, and Americans drank more than 893 million gallons of wine in 2014, according to the association. That was roughly the equivalent of 1,353 Olympic-size swimming pools. Wine sales in the United States have increased every year since 1993, and shipments reached $37.6 billion last year , according to the Wine Institute. Americans’ growing interest in wine is reflected in crowds that see seasoned veterans who know the importance of etiquette like spitting alongside budding sommeliers who are trying to figure out what they like — as well as parties who just want to drink and have a good time. “Unless they’re a church, they’re going to be loud,” said Debbie Luhrs, the special event planner for By the Bay Transportation, a company that conducts wine tours on northern Michigan’s Leelanau and Old Mission peninsulas. “By the time they’ve spent four hours tasting wine, they’re all a group now. They’re all friends, so if one is having a good time, they’re all having a good time.” The complaints arise when not everyone is in on the fun. In interviews, winery staff members and tour operators said that noise complaints were common, but they rarely resulted in the premature end of a tour or the dismissal of a patron. Complaints are typically resolved quickly, in large part because employees are trained to handle problems before they escalate, and efforts are made in the preparation stages to keep large groups separate from smaller parties. Like many of its counterparts, By the Bay trains drivers and staff members to read passengers and make calls on what measures to take to modify undesirable behaviors. It is one of the rare companies that sets expectations for patrons with written codes of conduct. Those codes usually cover the consumption of alcohol before a tour and on vehicles and premises, as well as seemingly obvious behavioral no-nos, like vulgar or inappropriate language, public urination and lewd or salacious acts. Basically, all of the things people do when they have had too much alcohol. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:15:25.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
