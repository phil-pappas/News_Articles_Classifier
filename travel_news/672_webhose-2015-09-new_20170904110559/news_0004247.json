We flagged down a stewardess quickly and brought the matter to her attention as we had yet to stop moving backwards,\" Gowd told the Daily Mail. Passengers disembarked and the flight was cancelled. \" We were first told that there was a plane waiting for us at an adjacent gate. Once we got there, we were told that there was no plane and that we were to go to the check-in counter for further information. After about two hours, I got a future travel voucher and a flight ticket for tomorrow,\" Gowd added. C'mon @SouthwestAir get it together. We're sitting stranded with no where to go. @RFWill149 \nThe other plane had arrived from Phoenix earlier on Sunday evening and was empty. \nBoth planes were taken out of service and will undergo a maintenance check. \n\"Safety is always our number one focus, and we are conducting an internal review to identify details surrounding yesterday's event,\" Eliasen said. \"Our employees are working as quickly as possible to re-accommodate all customers,\" airline spokeswoman Alyssa Eliasen said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T06:16:17.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
