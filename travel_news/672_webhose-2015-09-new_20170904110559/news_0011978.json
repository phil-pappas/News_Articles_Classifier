The Enchanted Village features five treehouses each sleeping a group of up to eight people in four separate bedrooms. Each treehouse has its own unique style with luxury furnishings, self-catering facilities, a relaxing lounge area with 50” plasma TV and games console, and an outdoor decking area with private hot tub overlooking serene woodland. The Enchanted Village treehouse accommodation works perfectly in conjunction with Alton Towers Resort’s three Christmas party nights available for the 2015 festive season. Delegates can choose from the Secret Garden Christmas Party, which involves a four-course Christmas meal and carol singers in the Secret Garden Restaurant, A Caribbean Christmas where guests will enjoy Christmas trimmings overlooking the waterpark, followed by dancing the night away to much -loved music at the disco, and The Nutcracker Ball, a new package for 2015, which sees the Stateroom transformed into the Christmas scene of the famous ballet. All five of the new treehouses are now available for corporate Christmas party nights for £600 (sleeping up to 8 delegates) on any of the party night dates excluding 18th December 2015.
