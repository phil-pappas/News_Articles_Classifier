But it hardly ever rains, and the arid atmosphere makes Arizona the best place to preserve historic aircraft as well as store state-of-the-art war machines whose numbers are temporarily in excess of military requirements.\nAt the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base’s “boneyard,” the wings of precision-parked bombers form a dizzying herringbone pattern that stretches far into the distance.\nNearby, the privately funded Pima Air & Space Museum offers more than 300 historic aircraft ranging from biplane to blimp and from the practical to the preposterous. It also manages the last surviving example of a Titan II silo, which still shelters its pencil-like missile.\nThis once threatened to deliver a mini-sun to an unknown target 6,000 miles away, a thought that might dim the cheerful sunniness of the silo’s surroundings even before the descent underground to visit the silo’s control room. But, as guides point out, the great success of the Titan II program was that under the Cold War doctrine of mutually assured destruction, no missile was ever fired.\nThe descent on steel staircases and through multiple doors with Cold War-era security is eerie. There are old phones via which visitors request passage through each door, and a red-painted metal canister on one wall where users burned a one-time-use access code.\nThe three-story underground control bunker is a museum of newly quaint communications technology — vacuum tubes and punched paper tape. Youths are often flummoxed by the rotary-dial telephones, let alone the other knobs, dials and illuminated switches on enameled cabinets from before graphic user interfaces and touch screens.\nWith a volunteer from the tour group, the guide takes visitors through the drama of launching the missile. Various buttons light up to confirm fueling and targeting, a klaxon sounds to indicate the silo is open, and there’s a countdown — three, two, one — to the simultaneous turning of two keys. The missile is still safely stored.\nBack at the Pima Air & Space Museum’s main site, the Space Gallery includes a mock-up of the 4,000-mph X-15 rocket plane, the sleek black arrow for which Neil Armstrong was a test pilot. But there are stranger creatures still among the museum’s bestiary of original aircraft, crowded into multiple hangars and filling the surrounding apron.\nThere’s the tiny Osprey 2 of 1970, designed for police duties in Southeast Asia, that’s little more than a bubble with wings, and models of proposals for a flying submarine that never took off. The aptly named Bumble Bee, a stubby-winged biplane painted in yellow and black, was built for the sole purpose of earning the title of world’s smallest aircraft.\nThe pride of the indoor collection is an SR-71A Blackbird spy plane commissioned by the CIA, capable of flying at more than three times the speed of sound, and holder of several speed and altitude records. Shaped like a flying knife blade, it has giant engines, inward-leaning twin tail fins, and matte black paint, making it look as if newly invented for the latest Batman movie despite actually being designed in the 1950s.\nVisitors can stroll around the apron unaccompanied, or ride in gentle comfort on an electric shuttle and listen to commentary from a volunteer guide. These guides are typically retired pilots with experience at the controls of some of the machines on display and able to discuss their strengths and weaknesses and share obscure details, such as how to tell presidential from vice-presidential planes by their livery.\nPima is also the place to catch a special bus to the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base for a tour of the “boneyard,” now the sole storage site for temporarily or permanently retired U.S. government and military aircraft. Security is tight, and no camera bags or liquids other than water are permitted. There’s no photography allowed in the gate area, and photo ID is required.\nHere it’s the repetition of shapes and the sheer volume of aircraft that amaze. There are nuclear bombers decommissioned as a result of arms limitations agreements, and there are fighters undergoing refits before sale to U.S. allies. There are machines gradually being gutted for valuable and reusable metals, and others partway through complete dismemberment. And then there are those, partly shrink-wrapped and painted white for protection against UV, patiently awaiting a return to service and another day in the sun.\nBut for the visitor, time just flies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T06:45:42.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
