The country’s largest state, Western Australia, offers pristine coastlines, epic landscapes and a sun-blessed spread of relaxed towns and cities. It covers a third of the continent and offers an abundance of wildlife, adventure and scenic diversity. One of its greatest gifts, however, is its food and drink scene. Here, you’ll eat and drink exceptionally well. The coastal capital city of Perth, one of Australia’s gourmet hot spots, is the most fitting place to start. Here you’ll find everything from street food and basement bars to fine dining and rooftop restaurants, all benefiting from Western Australia’s superb local produce. From rock lobsters, pearl oysters and artisan cheeses to black truffles, tropical fruits and handmade chocolates, the state places huge value on the provenance and quality of its food. Perth also has the very real advantage of having one of Australia’s most acclaimed winelands on its doorstep. The beautiful vineyards of the Margaret River region are famed for their well-balanced chardonnays and cabernet sauvignons, helping the state to account for 25 per cent of all the country’s premium wine. And if you come calling in November, you’ll catch Margaret River’s annual Gourmet Escape festival, which this year features the likes of Rick Stein and Marco Pierre White. With a food basket as rich and varied as that of Western Australia, meals can often become experiences in themselves Western Australia’s reputation, you may have gathered, has travelled far. And it’s not just wine that’s being toasted. Australia’s burgeoning craft beer scene has its roots in the state, and excellent ciders are being produced in the apple-growing regions of the south-west. Very good gins and whiskies are also distilled here. If caffeine’s more your thing, you’ll enjoy sampling the wares of the outstanding small-batch coffee roasters in Perth, Fremantle and elsewhere. This passion for good food and drink is evident across the map. Sustainability plays a big role, whether through biodynamic wineries or organic vegetable-growers, and so, too, does culinary innovation. The profusion of fresh seasonal flavours and succulent seafood means food regions as diverse as Perth, the Kimberley and the Southern Forests are all brimming with creative, award-winning chefs. Indeed, with a food basket as rich and varied as that of Western Australia, meals can often become experiences in themselves. The state’s long, proud Aboriginal heritage means that indigenous ingredients are also of real importance. Foraging tours are readily available – and if you’ve never tasted freshly caught mud crab or bush fruits, you don’t know what you’re missing. It’s similarly common to see the likes of kangaroo, lemon myrtle, bunya nut and marron crayfish on restaurant menus. With luxurious accommodation and 7,500 miles of Indian Ocean, Australia is an inspirational travel destination. Equally enticing are the mealtime rewards – the world-class restaurants, fine wines, first-rate produce and copious seafood are near limitless.
