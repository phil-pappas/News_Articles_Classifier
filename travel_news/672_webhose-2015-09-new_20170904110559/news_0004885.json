The new hangar will be adjacent to PSA’s current maintenance hangar located at the Dayton International Airport and will be the airline’s largest hangar yet.\nPSA’s current and anticipated growth has necessitated the development of the additional facility. With over 60 additional aircraft being inducted to PSA’s fleet over the next two years, additional space is needed for overnight maintenance on the fleet. This new maintenance facility comes soon after the announcement of PSA’s third maintenance base at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport to PSA’s footprint.\nThe ceremony included dignitaries from the Dayton Community as well as representatives from Dayton Power & Light, The Dayton Development Coalition, Sinclair Community College and the City of Dayton.\nThe construction of the 69,000 square foot hangar is set to begin immediately and is anticipated to be complete by spring of 2016.\nSource:- PSA Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T11:51:58.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
