Used to being overlooked in favour of its cousins on the eastern seaboard, laid-back Adelaide has quietly gone about becoming one of the most appealing urban destinations in the world. This is no idle hyperbole. A global list released in mid-August named South Australia ’s beach-lined, vineyard-ringed capital as one of the planet’s top five most “liveable” cities, a fitting endorsement for somewhere with an easy-going outlook, a handsome setting – and a world-class food and drink offering. Liveable? It’s loveable, too. There are very good reasons why those who travel here tend so often to become repeat visitors. This is a city of festivals and markets, parks and wineries, art galleries and white sands. It was founded way back in 1836 (famously as a colony for “free settlers”) and has since grown into a welcoming, multicultural city that values the good things in life. A prime spot on the southern coastline also gives it plenty of swimming beaches and sunshine, not to mention fertile terrain for some of the best local produce in the country. Whether you’re after fine dining menus, al fresco seafood, beach barbecues or specialist street food, Adelaide has variety in spades On which note, of course, the quality of South Australia’s food and drink is now acclaimed. From fresh seafood and award-winning wines to handcrafted cheeses and premium chocolates, the region’s larder is a generously stocked one. And in Adelaide – where church spires and one of the world’s most picturesque cricket grounds still crown the skyline – you’ll find a whole host of inviting ways of sampling it. There’s a real sense of community in the city, meaning a genuine connection between growers, producers, winemakers, chefs and consumers. You can see this for yourself with a trip to Adelaide Farmers’ Market, a great place to start experiencing the local food scene. In place for more than 145 years, it holds some 80 stalls offering a tempting spread of bakeries, delis, grocers and fishmongers. One highlight is the Asian food court, where sushi dishes, noodle boxes and Chinese specialities are served up in lively surrounds. The Tasting Australia festival Adelaide is often dubbed the “Twenty Minute City”, a nod to the fact that its key attractions are located within easy reach of each other, and the Farmers’ Market is a fine example. Gouger and Grote Streets, both steps away from the market, are lined with independent cafés and eateries, while a short stroll north brings you to the Peel-Leigh Street Precinct, the city’s newest “laneway dining” area. Here, expect everything from Mod-Oz seafood to Mediterranean tapas, not to mention an eclectic range of cafés. Cafés, in fact, are something of a local obsession. Adelaide treats coffee with the reverence it deserves, and just as there’s no such thing as a “standard” South Australian coffee (baristas and boutique roasters use beans from across the world), there’s also no such thing as a “standard” Adelaide café. You’ll find hole-in-the-wall pop-ups, mobile coffee carts and traditional Italian specialists, plus all sorts of welcoming outlets that feel more like living rooms than café spaces. The world is taking notice of Adelaide. It knows all about how to delight and surprise If you fancy a different type of tipple, you’re very much in the right place. The vineyards of South Australia account for more than half of the country’s wine production, with regions such as Barossa and McLaren Vale, and winemakers including Penfolds and Jacob’s Creek, enjoying deserved renown around the world. So where best to enjoy a glass of shiraz, riesling, chardonnay and other great varieties? There are 18 distinct wine regions in the state, meaning Adelaide has around 200 cellar doors to visit. Combine a local wine with great food in the city. Adelaide’s cosmopolitan East End is one of the destination’s big foodie hot spots – it’s where laneways and boulevards such as Ebenezer Place and Rundle Street are located, offering excellent wine cellars, bistros, beer pubs and restaurants. The city’s restaurant scene is superb. The choice of stellar dining options is huge, from the ground-breaking Orana, where innovations such as charred kangaroo tartare top the billing, to the seriously cool Press* Food & Wine, where the stated aim is “to bring the best products from our patch of the earth to the table” (lucky for them there’s so much choice). Rundle Street in the East End And whether you’re after fine dining menus, al fresco seafood, beach barbecues or specialist street food, Adelaide has variety in spades. The city has recently been lauded by both Lonely Planet and the New York Times as one of their top places to visit worldwide – this habit of falling for Adelaide is catching on, you’ll notice – and as well as being a great place to eat, it’s also a great place to wander. By visiting the city’s colourful weekend markets, you’ll be able to combine the two activities. The best to visit? Take your pick from Gilles Street Market, where Thai curries and Italian gelato are found alongside fashion and design items; Adelaide Farmers Market, voted the best of its kind in Australia; the Market Shed on Holland, where fresh organic produce takes the starring role; and Flinders Street Market, a great spread of farm-grown food and vintage stalls. Al fresco dining at Glenelg beach It’s also well worth timing a trip here to coincide with Australia’s leading eating and drinking celebration. A date for your diary is the first week of May in 2016, when the city will be hosting its annual, eight-day Tasting Australia festival. It’s all about participation, so expect wine poured by the winemaker, long lunches at farms, cookery demonstrations and a focus on the producers and produce that makes South Australia such a gastronomy magnet. The world is taking notice of Adelaide. It’s somewhere that knows all about how to delight and surprise, and with its superb coastline and wide green spaces, it looks the part too. Creative, self-confident and packed with arty events, it’s a city that holds real rewards for the curious at heart. Oh, and did we mention the food and drink?
