For Crystal Cruises’ 2015 and 2016 ultra-luxury voyages on Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity, the line is extending the “Book Now” deadline to December 30, 2015, allowing travel professionals to offer savvy travelers the most attractive fares without the risk of increases before the end of the year. Crystal is also guaranteeing lower fares for nearly every category on 2017 and 2018 voyages, automatically adjusting the brochure fares to ensure that new bookings all benefit from the celebration while existing bookings are protected at the new lower fares. In addition to savings of up to $6,000 per stateroom, the line’s “As You Wish” shipboard spending credits of up to $500 per stateroom will allow guests to customize their acclaimed Crystal experiences on select voyages.\n“Our professional travel partners work with some of the most selective travelers in the world, who not only expect unparalleled luxury and service from the World’s Best cruise line, but also great value,” says Crystal President and CEO Edie Rodriguez. “The savings, extension of the booking deadline and fare protection presents tremendous opportunity for agents to offer their clients a six-star vacation for extremely compelling fares.”\nCrystal’s acclaimed voyages for the remainder of 2015 through a record-breaking four World Cruises in early 2018 are now available for booking, offering innovative itineraries, enriching adventures ashore and Crystal’s famously unmatched standard of service. Travelers can choose from dozens of journeys through the Mediterranean, Northern Europe, British Isles and to the Far East, Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific, New England & Canada, the Panama Canal and the Caribbean, South America, Alaska, and Antarctica.\nBoasting all-inclusive amenities, entertainment, fine dining, premium beverages and expanded complimentary internet, Crystal’s limited-time Book Now Cruise-Only fares start at $1,485 per person.\nSource:- Crystal Cruises", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:55:06.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
