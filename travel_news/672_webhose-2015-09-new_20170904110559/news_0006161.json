Tens of thousands of staff had worked on these aircraft.\" \nMost New Zealanders would have had their first jet flight on a 737, he said. \nBlack had been flying the 737 for seven years since he joined Air New Zealand in 2008. \nIn 1998 they upgraded from the 737-200 to the newer version of the jet, the 737-300, Black said. \n\"It's just like buying an old Holden Commodore versus a newer one. We upgraded. Faster, more efficient, bigger. Just a better version of the old one.\" \nSince then the airline has operated a total of 23 737-300s, he said. Ad Feedback \n\"The last two 737's we've got are the last two ever built by Boeing. This was the second to last.\" \nThe planes still could operate for another 10 years and would be sold off to other airlines overseas, Black said. \n\"These are pretty desirable. They're not a new aeroplane but they are pretty capable.\" \n\"It's old technology bit it still works great.\" \nThe Boeing 737 would be replaced by the Airbus A320, which were around 15 percent more fuel efficient, he said. \nAir New Zealand wanted more efficient, bigger planes that would provide a better experience for passengers, Black said. \n\"When you're burning as much fuel as an airline does that's a massive improvement.\" \nIt's the end of an era, Black said. \nAir New Zealand 737 Flight Instructor captain Geoff Rowe who had been flying the 737 for 22 years said a lot of the pilots were quite fond of the 737 planes. \nRowe compared the jets to and old Holden or Ford V8. \n\"We'd still like to hang on to the old V8.\" \nRowe said he would be moving to the Airbus fleet where there was a position held for him. \nIn September NAC – which merged with Air New Zealand in 1978 – took delivery of its first Boeing 737-200, and operated its first commercial flight in October between Auckland and Wellington. \nAir New Zealand's 737-200 fleet made more than 825,000 flights during its 33 years with the airline. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T09:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T21:55:32.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
