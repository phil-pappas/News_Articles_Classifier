Many regional economies are almost entirely dependent upon visitors to nearby national parks to support restaurants, lodging establishments and other businesses, and the jobs they provide. \nThe shuttering of national parks due to the 16-day budget stalemate of October 2013 directly reduced travel spending by $680 million, U.S. Travel calculated, or nearly $43 million per day. During that shutdown, countries such as Germany, the U.K. and China—which together account for more than eight million visitors to the U.S. annually—issued warnings to their citizens about possible shutdown-related problems and delays when traveling to and within the U.S. Even once resolved, such episodes can inflict lasting damage upon the U.S.'s brand in the competitive international travel marketplace, Dow warned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T23:40:06.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
