This is the latest deployment among a wide variety of the Toyota Motor Corporation's brands, which have been using MOST50 in their infotainment systems for many years, including both volume and luxury vehicles. In the new Alphard implementation, Toyota is using MOST Â® technology to ensure high-quality digital audio streaming throughout the vehicle.\nTo learn more about Microchip's MOST networking products, visit http://www.microchip.com/MOST-092215a .\nTo date, more than 170 million MOST devices have been installed in 191 car models since 2001. Toyota and all major carmakers have for many years successfully implemented MOST technology in their multi-node infotainment networking systems, as it provides a field-proven, low-risk, whole-system solution. Toyota's networks utilize Microchip's MOST50 INICs, which feature an Electrical Physical Layer (ePHY) that is optimized for use with Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) copper wire. The result is a system that can predictably and efficiently transport video, audio, packet and control data throughout the vehicle without time-synchronization protocols, using dedicated channels for minimal processor overhead in the main infotainment control unit processors. The remote-connection-management and remote-control capabilities of all MOST INICs enable further options, including the ability to build slim (processor-less) network nodes. MOST INICs also provide industry-standard hardware interfaces to processor and peripheral devices for the efficient routing of audio, video and packet data, which greatly simplifies module designs. End users can immediately access the vehicle's infotainment system, due to the MOST INIC's ultra-fast network startup feature.\n\"We are excited about Toyota's latest implementation of our MOST50 technology in its Alphard infotainment system,\" said Dan Termer, vice president of Microchip's Automotive Information Systems Division. \"Toyota has been using MOST technology for several years, and they are now using it to achieve high-quality digital audio in the Alphard, which is a key differentiator in the executive-lounge class of vehicles.\"\nThe MOST Cooperation standards enable automotive OEMs and their Tier 1 suppliers with a proven and well-supported methodology for defining and implementing high-bandwidth infotainment and Advanced Driver Assistance (ADAS) systems, including a standard physical layer and a robust method for system management and control with superior reliability and Quality of Service (QoS). Using MOST technology also results in reduced weight for easier compliance with environmental regulations.\nTo learn more about Microchip's MOST networking products, visit http://www.microchip.com/MOST-092215a .\nResources\nHigh-res Image Available Through Flickr or Editorial Contact (feel free to publish): http://www.microchip.com/Logo-092215a\nFollow Microchip:\nRSS Feed for Microchip Product News: http://www.microchip.com/RSS-092215a Twitter: http://www.microchip.com/Twitter-092215a Facebook: http://www.microchip.com/Facebook-092215a YouTube: http://www.microchip.com/YouTube-092215a About Microchip Technology\nMicrochip Technology Inc.
