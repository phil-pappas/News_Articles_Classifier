(Jon Ranhand) August 27 Our readers share tales of their rambles around the world.\nWho: Jon and Barbara Ranhand (the author) of Rockville.\nWhere, when, why: We were planning to travel to South Dakota for at least a week to visit places that we have always wanted to see — Mount Rushmore and the Crazy Horse Memorial. While vacationing in Panama this year, we met people from North Dakota who suggested that we also visit the town of Medora, N.D., to see their annual country music festival.\nHighlights and high points: The beauty and grandeur of the Badlands in North Dakota and South Dakota were beyond what we expected. Mount Rushmore and Crazy Horse were magnificent, and it was exciting to be there after seeing so many photographs over the years. Driving through South Dakota’s Custer State Park and taking a side trip to Devil’s Tower in Wyoming were other fascinating additions to our itinerary. Being fans of the HBO series “ Deadwood ,” we visited the restored town, toured the tavern where Wild Bill Hickok was killed by Jack McCall and saw Mount Moriah cemetery (Boot Hill) where both he and Calamity Jane are buried.\nCultural connection or disconnect: Disappointment: We drove to Sturgis, S.D., and, because it was several weeks before its famed motorcycle-rally week, there was no one there. The town was quite empty and tame. We did see a picture on the wall of a building showing thousands of cyclists on the main street when the festivity is in full swing. Interesting connection: We met a young lady from Spearfish, S.D., while waiting for a delayed connection to Rapid City, S.D. She suggested driving through the Spearfish Canyon on our way north to Deadwood. It was a spectacular drive that we otherwise would have missed.\nBiggest laugh or cry: The Medora Musical was an unabashed delight. It was a foot-stomping, patriotic, tuneful event set in a beautiful outdoor amphitheater complete with a majestic elk on the hilltop behind the stage. Before the show, we dined at Pitchfork Steak Fondue. There were 12-ounce ribeye steaks stuck on a pitchfork and cooked in vats of hot oil. They were delicious.\nHow unexpected: Theodore Roosevelt established a ranch in North Dakota that is now home to the magnificent national park bearing his name. In Medora, there was a gathering of 10 reenactors who portray the president when we were there, so we got to meet “President Roosevelt.”\nFondest memento or memory: Our greatest memory was of the beauty of the Badlands in North and South Dakota. Most people are familiar with the scenery in other parts of the United States, but there is little promotion of the wonders of the Dakotas. When we told people we were going to the Dakotas for nine days, most people said, “Why?” We were so awed by the magnificent sights, we have taken it upon ourselves to promote Dakota tourism.\nTo tell us about your trip, go to washingtonpost.com/travel and fill out the What a Trip form with your fondest memories, finest moments and favorite photos.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006FO5LO"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:27:40.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
