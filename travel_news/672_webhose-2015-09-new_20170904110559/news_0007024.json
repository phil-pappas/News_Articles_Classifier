But it took trial and error. Tipping is just one of those things that is hard to tell if you are doing it wrong. Too much? Too little? What is just right? \nThis guide will help you understand how much to tip in Germany for restaurants , hotels , taxis and various services. Tipping in German Restaurants \nInitially, talking to friends here in Germany did little to alleviate my concerns. People who I consider very generous had no problem leaving no tip if they were practically strapped. I heard the lame excuse of being a student more than once. How did they think this was acceptable? \nThe truth is, tipping is appreciated in Germany but not necessarily expected. This may be why service is so lackluster compared to American standards. You may not be moved to tip, especially in Berlin , the sneer capital of service. \nAlso consider that service is usually included in your bill (marked as Bedienung ) and even the word for tip, Trinkgeld or “drinking money”, indicates it should be no more than small change. It is common practice to leave between 5 and 10 percent at a sit-down restaurant and just round up to the nearest euro or two at a cafe . How to Tip in a German Restaurant \nIf you wait to receive the bill, you will be waiting forever. Instead, when you are ready to pay, signal the waiter and ask for the bill (\" Die Rechnung bitte \"). The server will bring the bill and usually expect payment as they stand there. This requires you to decide on the tip quickly and can be unnerving for foreigners - at first. Estimate what you expect to pay and what you want to tip before signalling them and this should be a stress-free transaction. \nFor example, if the bill comes to 14.50 euro, you can simply say \"16 euro\" and the server will immediately deliver your change. If you would like for them to keep the change, like if you are paying 20 euro even, you can say, \" Stimmt so \". Viola! Trinkgeld . \nAlso try to tip in cash, even if you are paying by card. This is the best way to get the tip to the server. Tipping in German Hotels \nTipping at hotels is not as common as in the USA. For good service in a starred hotel, you can give the porter an euro per bag and leave housekeeping 3 to 5 euros per night. If the concierge provides a service, such as calling in a reservation at a fine dining restaurant , you can tip up to 20 euros. \nIf staying in a homey Pension, similar to a B&B, tipping is not expected. Tipping Taxis in Germany \nTipping is not required in German taxis, but it is common to round up to the nearest euro. For good service (speaking English, child seat, loading luggage) you can leave gratuity up to 10%. Tipping Tour Guides in Germany \nFor a good tour guide in Germany, you can tip up to 10%. This is especially true for private tours or multi-day tours. For a free tour you should still tip at least 5 euro as the guides usually must pay the company for every person that shows up, regardless whether they tip or not. \nOverall, the best advice is to tip what feels comfortable to you.
