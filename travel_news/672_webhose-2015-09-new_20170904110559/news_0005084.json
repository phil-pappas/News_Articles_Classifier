The inaugural design will debut during New York Fashion Week in September 2015 and the second design in the series will launch during February 2016 Fashion Week. Inspired by the property’s iconic views of the city and Central Park, the first scarf will be available for purchase at Mandarin Oriental, New York beginning on Friday, September 12, 2015.\nThe inaugural scarf has been designed with today’s glamorous jetsetter in mind and takes its inspiration from the panoramic views of Central Park from the hotel. The intricate black and white pattern of the scarf is reminiscent of tree branches in Central Park during the winter season, an element that is also reflected within the hotel’s Restaurant Asiate with its glittering Murano glass ceiling installation, Central Park Trees. A subtle stripe of rich orchid purple that is signature to the hotel’s restaurant is woven into the edges of the scarf’s fabric for an elevated touch of style. The scarf measures 48 inches by 48 inches, is made of 100% modal and will retail for USD 350 at the hotel’s Spa Boutique.\nThis is the second collaboration between Mandarin Oriental, New York and Rodarte on signature pieces for the property that began with the Rodarte New York City Guide, a functional map of Manhattan depicting some of the most special places Kate and Laura Mulleavy have experienced during their trips to New York in 2014. The Rodarte New York City Guide is available as a guest amenity exclusively in the 42 restyled one- and two-bedroom suites of the property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:16:19.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
