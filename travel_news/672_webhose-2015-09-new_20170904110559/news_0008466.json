In the few lone minutes busy travellers get between catching up on emails, briefings for meetings and the checking of schedules, it’s a true pleasure to sink undisturbed into a good book. But reading for pleasure doesn’t mean you can’t get an edge on the competition. Here are some recent business books that you could digest in a single flight – leaving you thoroughly informed and more than a little entertained. Black Box Thinking Matthew Syed The role that failure plays in success is the hackneyed message of clichéd pulp business books the world over. But, appropriately for a former Olympic table tennis player and parliamentary candidate, Matthew Syed has managed to put a new spin on the subject. He extols the benefits of the kind of forensic, no-blame approach to failure that has been embraced by the aviation industry and mirrored by the marginal gains of cycling’s dominant force, Team Sky. It is a stark contrast, he says, with the litigious, finger-pointing world of healthcare, where preventable medical error is the third-biggest cause of death in Western countries. Published 10 September, Hodder & Stoughton Rising Strong Brené Brown The path from Texan social work researcher to global self-help phenomenon is not a well-trodden one. But Brené Brown’s 2010 TED talk about the need to confront shame and vulnerability struck such as chord that it has now been viewed more than 21 million times. Brown was using the term “lean in” long before the publication of Sheryl Sandberg’s book, although she differs from the Facebook executive’s forthright style. Brown’s self-deprecating demeanour and delivery have led to comparisons with Ellen DeGeneres, but there is enough academic rigour behind her work (she still holds a post at the University of Houston) to mean that her advice has been sought by the US military and Fortune 500 companies. Out now [Published 27/8/2015], Ebury Publishing Leading Alex Ferguson, with Michael Moritz Football fans leapt on Sir Alex Ferguson’s imaginatively titled second autobiography, My Autobiography, when it was released just a few months after he abdicated the Old Trafford hot seat in 2013. But this effort, for which the Scot partnered with Welsh venture capitalist Sir Michael Moritz, is written with a business readership in mind. Ferguson explains the principles of tactics, teamwork, recruitment and general management that secured an unprecedented 38 trophies during his 26-year reign – and admits that his unwavering commitment to discipline might, at times, have counted against him. Published 22 September, Hodder & Stoughton Limitless Ajaz Ahmed Having dropped out of university aged 21, Ajaz Ahmed established AKQA, a digital advertising agency that was valued at $540m when bought by Sir Martin Sorrell’s WPP in 2012. In his second book – a follow-up to the best-selling Velocity – Ahmed explains what can be learnt from the lives and careers of groundbreaking business leaders “who didn’t just grow their profits, but expanded the horizons of their customers and our culture”. Chapters about the usual marquee names (Henry Ford, Steve Jobs) sit alongside less familiar business parables about Nike’s ambition to run an organisation as if it were an athlete and how JJ Abrams’ love of storytelling could influence the companies of tomorrow. Published 1 October, Vermilion Inside the Nudge Unit David Halpern The Behavioural Insights Team at No 10, better known as the “nudge unit”, has come to be regarded as one of the more successful features of David Cameron’s tenure. Using applied behavioural economics, the unit has boosted the number of organ donors signing up in a year by 100,000, encouraged 20 per cent more people to consider switching energy provider, and doubled the number of army applicants. This book, written by the head of the unit, Dr David Halpern, and subtitled “How small changes can make a big difference”, shows that what we say often does not matter if we do not take the time to think about how we are saying it.
