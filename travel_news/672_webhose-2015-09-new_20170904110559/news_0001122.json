Each property provides guests with space, luxury, functional simplicity, dedicated services and a signature “well-being” programme aimed at healthy living. They are also perfectly located for guests who need convenient access to Bangkok’s CBD or who want to explore the city’s best shopping and entertainment districts. All these refined characteristics prompt us to group them under the Grande Centre Point Hotels brand.”\nThe Grande Centre Point Hotels brand seeks to offer services and experiences for guests that go above and beyond the high class offerings of properties under its affiliated Centre Point Hospitality. Grande refers to a premium on space and location with easy access to the city’s main central business districts such as Sukhumvit, Siam and Silom where multinational companies’ headquarters and government offices are found.\nThe Grande Centre Point Hotels are all within two minute walks of the mass transportation systems such as the BTS Skytrain or the MRT Underground stations so Bangkok’s best shopping, dining and entertainment areas are within easy reach. In the case of the Grande Centre Point Terminal 21, the hotel and adjoining luxury T21 mall actually connects via a sky-bridge.\nThe Grande Centre Point Hotels are all within two minute walks of the mass transportation systems such as the BTS Skytrain or the MRT Underground stations so Bangkok’s best shopping, dining and entertainment areas are within easy reach.

We can boast all the facilities and experiences that other luxury brands do, but with an emphasis on the Thai experience, health and green tourism. We intend to expand this concept to new venues in Bangkok and further afield.”\nContemporary design has been used through the three existing Grande Centre Point properties from guest rooms to meeting areas and the spa. This ensures a stay that is not only luxurious but highly memorable. The emphasis on clean, green living and the well-being programme means that no alcohol is sold on the hotel premises and there are a range of sports and leisure activities to enjoy, including tennis courts, fully-equipped gyms, jogging tracks and pools. In addition, the green programme is aimed partnering with our guests to set new environmental standards for Thai hotels and to conserve natural resources.\nL&H Hotel Management is currently expanding the Grande Centre Point Hotels portfolio with the plan to open a new hotel in Bangkok’s Thong Lo area in 2016 and to expand to other locations in Thailand within the next three years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:16:32.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
