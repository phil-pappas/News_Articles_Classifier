To gain Travelife Gold certification a hotel must meet 150 strict sustainability criteria, including environmental issues, such as minimising waste and use of energy, water and chemicals. \nIn addition, a hotel is assessed on the positive and on-going action it takes on social issues, such as employee welfare, working with the local community, child protection and human rights as well as clearly demonstrating how they are helping to support local businesses and protect local traditions and wildlife. \nKata Group Resorts, owners of Beyond Resorts, President and Owner, Mr Pramookpisitt Achariyachai, said: “We are delighted to win this prestigious award. All the team have worked very hard to maximise our efforts to save on energy and leave the lightest footprint possible in an emerging location. \n“Key to many of our initiatives has been to integrate our social and community work into the guest experience, offering insights into traditional ways of life while at the same time making valuable contributions to the local community.
