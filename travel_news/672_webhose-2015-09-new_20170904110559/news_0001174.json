He had no interest in it himself, but was always happy to share tales over beers and sunsets.\nHe first mentioned the Spot on a warm Saturday afternoon, pulling over his backcountry limousine (a seven-passenger motorized buggy) near the end of a 90-minute, mostly off-road tour of the woods near the Hannagan Meadow Lodge in eastern Arizona's Blue Range Primitive Area.\nHannagan Meadow Lodge What: Cozy timbered lodge with seven rooms and seven cabins. Summer room rates (April 15-Oct. 31) are $85-$125; cabins are $150-$200. Winter room rates are $65-$95; cabins are $115-$175.\nWhere: 23 miles south of Alpine on U.S. 191 in eastern Arizona.\nSummer activities: Take in the scenery on a 90-minute tour aboard a seven-passenger buggy ($20 per person). Trail rides are $40 for one hour and $65 for two hours. Several trailheads are within a 10-minute drive. Aker Lake, about 20 minutes away, offers catch-and-release fishing. Best of all, bring a book, sit outside and enjoy nature in a Twitter- and Facebook-free way.\nWinter activities: Nearby trails offer snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Snowmobile tours cost $65 an hour per snowmobile (two people per vehicle).\nDetails: 928-339-4370, hannaganmeadow.com\nAs the buggy came to a bumpy stop next to the lodge's namesake pasture, Martinez turned toward his six passengers in the open-air vehicle.\nHe listened to them talk about what they had just seen — the small alpine lake cradled by rolling hills; endless pine-covered mountains spilling to the horizon.\nThen he got their attention by pointing toward the meadow and uttering the magic words: cellphone reception. In a place where there were no in-room TVs or phones, where the limited, lobby-only Wi-Fi signal was barely strong enough to carry e-mail, cell reception was digital gold.\n“You see that huge pine there?” Martinez said, pausing as his rapt audience nodded. “Behind it is an opening in the fence. Go through there and head straight east for 30 feet. Or maybe more. You’ll find a pile of rocks. I think. That’s what someone told me. Anyway, it’s around there somewhere.\"\nThough Martinez's X didn't exactly mark the Spot, his audience was intrigued. A few folks were inspired to return later, wading through dew-laden grass for the promise of a bar or two of cell service in an otherwise digital dead zone.\nBut for the rest, the lodge provides screen-free bliss, a chance to sever electronic tethers. It was like going back to the olden days. Say, the 1980s.\nHannagan Meadow Lodge caters to those who want to reconnect with nature, but not with a tent, backpack or shovel. It offers comfortable beds, hot meals and opportunity to live a Facebook-free life, at least for a few days.\nCutting the digital cord\nJackie Sereno and her grown son, Steven Burton, both of Scottsdale, sat on their cabin porch, steam no longer rising from the two cups of coffee on the table between them.\nThey’d risen an hour before, just as the sun peeked over the forested ridge that lines Hannagan Meadow just across U.S. 191.\nAfter taking photos in the early light, the two put on a pot of coffee and got busy doing what they came here to do — relax and disconnect.\nSereno, a mystery author, also was determined to work on her next novel. Nature, however, was weakening her resolve.\n“Right about at sunset yesterday, a herd of elk came out of the forest and grazed in the meadow,” Sereno said. “It was so beautiful to watch.”\nThe lodge was meeting all the expectations of Burton, who felt no need to be productive. To explain his travel goals, he retrieved a book from the cabin — “Hamlet’s Blackberry: Building a Good Life in the Digital Age,” by William Powers.\nHe placed the dog-eared tome on the table next to a smudge- and scratch-free smartphone that looked just out of the box.\n“The book is all about breaking away from the devices that dominate us every day,” Burton said. “There’s a lot to that, so this is my attempt to give it a try. So far, so good.”\nHe paused, noting the irony. “With, of course, a new phone. But it’s mostly for photos.”\nThe lush grasses of Hannagan Meadow often draw small herds of deer or elk. It's also said to be the home of a secret spot where cell service can be found in this remote location. (Photo: Scott Craven/The Republic)\nThose who put aside their devices are rewarded with experiences better witnessed in person than on Periscope.\nTime passes at Hannagan Meadow not just in minutes and hours but in moments that will evolve into memories.\nThose moments may be brief as the late-night yipping of a coyote, its bark bursting from the forest and bouncing off the hills. Or meeting the gazes of a doe and her fawn, if only for an instant before they scamper away.\nOther moments stretch on languidly. A walk along one of the many nearby trails reveals the seemingly endless scars from the 2011 Wallow Fire, nature providing hope amid the patches of aspen where leaves flutter on trees almost 7 feet tall.\nOr sit on the lodge’s wooden porch for a front-row seat to a late-afternoon thunderstorm. Clouds build over the eastern horizon, and soon, cool breezes riffle book pages, ushering in the first few drops. Before long, bolts of lightning precede long, low rumbles of thunder. The rain thickens, its thrum on the wooden roof making casual conversation both difficult and unnecessary.\nShould the clouds part by nightfall, visitors are treated to a sky heavy with stars, the mist of the Milky Way streaking through the center.\nTweet that, you digerati.\nTips and tricks\nHannagan Meadow is not for everyone — digitally addicted teens who can't breathe when Instagram fails to load, for example. For those happy to get away, here's how to make the most of your time in a wilderness with amenities:\nSummer is the busy season, thanks to temperatures ranging from the high 40s to low 80s. But winter offers more activities, including cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling. Equipment is available to rent. If you visit in winter, dress warmly. Rooms in the lodge are comfortably warm, and four of the seven cabins feature efficient pellet-fueled stoves. But three cabins have wood-burning stoves, and you may have to rise in the middle of the night to stoke the flames. The 90-minute buggy tour is well worth the $20 cost. It follows a primitive road to Aker Lake (which is the size of a pond), where many a chopper dipped its bucket to fight the Wallow Fire. It also includes a stop at Blue Vista, a stunning overlook of the White Mountains. Lodge rooms are cheaper than cabins, but a cabin may be a better deal when you factor in meals. The breakfast buffet is $12 per person, and lunch and dinner will run you $8 to $24 per person. Cabins, which sleep five to 10 people, have full kitchens, allowing you to cook your own meals and save big. An easy trail is just west of the stables. For longer, more strenuous hikes, you’ll need to hop in your car and drive a mile or so north or south, where well-marked trailheads await. If you desperately need a tether to the outside world, a big-screen satellite TV awaits in the community room (formerly the general store). You also can play pool or air hockey. When mapping your route, the drive looks shorter when taking the southern roads through Clifton and Morenci. What the map doesn’t show are traffic and terrain. If you take the northern route (U.S. 60 through Globe and Miami, up to Show Low and down to Hannagan Meadow), you’ll save about an hour. The best show occurs at sunset, when light skims over the lodge and across the meadow. You may see elk or deer emerge to graze, or a thunderstorm building over the ridges of pine. Relax on the porch, where every chair offers a view. A Wallow Fire near-miss\nHannagan Meadow seems to have been created for a lodge rather than the other way around. The meadow’s knee-high grasses and wildflowers roll along a short stretch of U.S. 191, balanced by the historical lodge and assortment of cabins.\nIt is a prime piece of tourist-friendly real estate, with the three-story lodge facing the picturesque break in the ponderosa-pine forest. The nearest bit of civilization (Alpine, more outpost than town) is roughly 23 miles north. Morenci, the closest neighbor to the south, is 67 miles away.\nIn addition to those seeking a stress-free night or two, the lodge is popular with bikers, hunters and travelers needing a break from the road. Its gas station and dining room offer a welcome break along 90 miles of otherwise uninterrupted pavement.\nThe lodge’s roots go back to 1926, during the construction of the Springerville-to-Clifton highway. The meadow seemed the perfect area for an idyllic break roughly halfway between the two towns.\nBut four years ago, Hannagan Meadow Lodge seemed to be in the worst possible spot. Visitors who open a well-worn photo album — one of several on a table in the lobby — will see how close the lodge came to being erased by a wall of flame.\nIn some photos, smoke thick enough to blot out the sun rises from behind the lodge, the structure seemingly just a few feet from disaster. Other photos show fire along a nearby ridge, flames rising in the night sky to create a false sunrise.\nThe photos were taken in the days after Memorial Day 2011, when embers from a partly extinguished campfire were carried by breezes, igniting the Wallow Fire, one of the worst the White Mountains had ever seen. Firefighters needed more than a month to fully contain it.\nA trail just behind the stable reveals the fire’s devastating effect. Pine trees stripped of needles and branches point upright, forming dense stands of immense toothpicks. The fickle nature of the fire emerges where smudges of green are seen among the environmental wreckage. Yet the carpet of green that spreads across formerly scorched hillsides, as well as the scattered gardens of aspen, remind visitors of nature’s determination.\nMartinez, who has lead dozens of tours in and around areas where the fire once danced, sees beauty in devastation.\n“It’s sad, but it’s also quite beautiful once you accept what happened,” he said. “The starkness the fire left behind is stunning. Forests have a certain sameness, but you won’t find that here.”\nThe lodge’s business was just one of the many things that suffered in the wake of the fire, but Martinez said summers have grown steadily busier.\n“Things are bouncing back,” he said. “The forest, business. Everything looks much better.”\nHannagan Meadow Lodge and cabins. (Photo: Roger Naylor/Special for the Republic)\nFar from the usual conveniences\nWorking in a remote place has its challenges.\nOn a Saturday morning in August, Martinez rose early for his two-minute commute from his cabin to the lodge’s kitchen, his Australian collie, Jackie, leading the way.\nAll was fine until he turned the faucet to start the day’s first pot of coffee. A few drops plopped into the carafe. Nothing more.\nThe lodge’s water comes from a nearby well, and 10 minutes later Martinez was restarting the pump before most guests realized there was a problem.\nOnce the pump was working, Martinez headed to the stables to take care of the half-dozen horses, the main reason the Tucson retiree was hired three summers ago.\nSince then, his job has evolved beyond caring for horses and leading trail rides. He cleans, assists in the dining room and is known to help guests check in after the front desk closes at 8 p.m.\nOne of his biggest adjustments was living so far from things taken for granted.\nA supermarket, for example. The nearest one is in Springerville, more than an hour away. Martinez takes a thorough list when he makes the trip every few weeks. Should he run out of basics, a trip to Alpine (40 minutes away) will do.\nYet he considers himself lucky every time he commutes to work.\n“Not many people get to see this every day,” Martinez said as he stretched out on the porch late Saturday afternoon. “It’s worth the inconveniences.”\nIncluding that lack of cell service. Although the lodge offers limited Wi-Fi in the lobby (enough to check e-mail, not nearly enough to stream Netflix), a cell signal is impossible to find.\nUnless you know where to look, which brings us back to the Spot.\nAccording to legend, it was discovered several years ago by an employee taking a cigarette break. She wandered across the highway, through a gap in the fence just behind that ponderosa pine, and stopped about 30 feet into the meadow, or maybe 40.\nOut of boredom, she peeked at her phone. That’s when she noticed the bars. Had she stumbled across cell reception? She made a call or two, just to make sure. After returning to the lodge, she described her find to guests and co-workers.\nSome found it. For others, it remained as elusive as Bigfoot.\nSince then, another employee scattered pine cones where she found a cell signal so others could hit the Spot.\nBut buffaloes aren’t the only things that roam on the range. Cell service does as well, so you will need patience and a reliable provider.\nI had both, allowing me to say in a call to my father, “I’m standing in a pasture in Hannagan Meadow, Arizona; such a fine sight to see.”\nBrief history, and a highway\nHannagan Meadow is named after a miner who incurred unpaid debts and was chained to a tree next to his namesake scenic clearing. According to the lodge's website, Robert Hannagan arrived in the area in the late 1890s and wound up owing two brothers $1,200 in a business deal. When he didn't pay, the brothers stopped a stagecoach, nabbed Hannagan and chained him to a tree until Hannagan's son made good on the debt. Before the Coronado Trail was designated U.S. 191 in 1996, it was U.S. 666, the Devil's Highway (or Highway of the Beast, as 666 is considered a satanic number). The 666 designation had been used since 1938, before the Arizona Department of Transportation changed it to 191 to conform to highway-numbering standards.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca7c6f111a89524e7b9a3b3c3b55b1de048dc9f2/c=529-0-1889-1813&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/09/11/Phoenix/Phoenix/635775776448226174-Hannagan-Meadow-17.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2015/09/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635775046263091738-CT-Hannagan-cabins.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ee391ab73bef22fed8dca3c6af171e0a7102a51f/r=500x374/local/-/media/2015/09/11/Phoenix/Phoenix/635775776448226174-Hannagan-Meadow-17.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/11/Phoenix/Phoenix/635775776448226174-Hannagan-Meadow-17.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635775046263091738-CT-Hannagan-cabins.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d80322a60a18f7c5e32abee3d7dcb05bdc873100/c=2-0-1997-1500&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/09/10/Phoenix/Phoenix/635775046263091738-CT-Hannagan-cabins.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-11T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T11:05:29.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
