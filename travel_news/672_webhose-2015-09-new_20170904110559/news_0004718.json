Supplementing the focus on the super-yacht sector are also plans to change immigration, revenue and customs rules to enable yachts and their staff to stay for a year, he added. \n\nA longer-term plan is to develop the cruising industry, where the lack of infrastructure remains a serious roadblock. According to Chula, there are plans to locate a terminal in Krabi on the Andaman Coast and another in Koh Samui for the Gulf of Thailand. \n\nWelcoming the government's plans, Andy Treadwell, managing director of yacht events company SYE, said: “There is definitely a lack of marinas in key places like Koh Samui and the west and southern coasts of Phuket.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T11:44:51.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
