We’re passionate about the quality of our food. Bryn’s culinary expertise along with our knowledge and experience, has allowed us to create something special for our First Class customers.”\n \n \nThe partnership began when a member of the Virgin Trains on-board team from Holyhead approached Bryn with the idea of working with Virgin Trains, after she noticed he was travelling regularly between London and North Wales whilst setting up his new restaurant at Porth Eirias in Colwyn Bay.\n \n \nBryn Williams, who is from Denbigh, said: “It is amazing to work with Virgin Trains and do something like this on my home patch. I’m proud to be able to offer customers quality food that is tasty and well thought-out; the dishes are classic combinations, using seasonal ingredients. The collaboration is a great team effort with people who share the same dreams and passion. Virgin Trains has this in abundance – from the catering team that produce the food to the on board staff who serve it, and without them it wouldn’t have been possible.”\n \n \nVicki Jones, North Wales Customer Experience Leader, said: “We’re really proud to offer our customers something unique and tasty that has been developed by an acclaimed local chef. Bryn has been fantastic to work with and listens to what we and our customers want. The new food has only been available for one week and it is already going down a treat.”\n \n \nThe new menu is available now until 8 th January 2016.\n \nSource:- Virgin Trains", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:43:36.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
