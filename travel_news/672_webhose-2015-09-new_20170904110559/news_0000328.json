The technology allows viewers to take a 360 degree tour through its economy, premium economy and business class cabins.\nAir New Zealand’s General Manager - UK/Europe, Kathryn Robertson, said the airline is always looking at ways to innovate: “We are constantly looking at ways to make things easier for the travel trade. This technology is exciting in that it allows the trade to virtually step onboard our aircraft and experience all three cabins and learn about our product in a new and unique way.”\nIn August, Air New Zealand announced record annual results as strong demand and low fuel prices helped the airline post earnings before tax of $496 million for the 2015 financial year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:04:54.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
