A stadium which is often regarded as one of the most 'idyllic' grounds in England. \nMoody will also offer the lucky tenants a private rugby lesson in his sprawling backyard, complete with its own mini rugby goal-posts. \nThe stately home offers two queen bedrooms, a double, twin and three bathrooms, complete with walk-in showers. \nThe property is not far from The Recreation Ground, Bath Rugby's official stadium. A stadium which is often regarded as one of the most 'idyllic' grounds in England. Airbnb \nThe stately home offers two queen bedrooms, a double, twin and three bathrooms all offering walk-in showers. \nThe location of the home also gives visitors the perfect chance to explore the beautiful city of Bath. \nHistoric Bath was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987 due to the city's exquisite Georgian architecture and well-preserved Roman remnants. \n'The World Cup is going to be an amazing experience for competitors and spectators alike and I'm keen to share it with as many people as possible – and what better way than to open up my own home?!' Moody wrote on his listing . \nAs with most Airbnb rentals, the property comes with its own set of rules. No pets, parties (unless England win the Rugby World Cup) and no All Blacks fans are allowed at the house with Moody imposing a blanket ban on the wearing of All Blacks or Welsh rugby shirts on his property. Ad Feedback \nPerforming of the haka is also strictly banned. Instead residents will be forced to sing 'God Save The Queen' at 8am every morning. \nThe renting of Moody's house also comes with a bit of charitable joy. All proceeds from the rental go to the Lewis Moody Foundation, a charity that provides special wishes for terminally ill children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:11:02.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
