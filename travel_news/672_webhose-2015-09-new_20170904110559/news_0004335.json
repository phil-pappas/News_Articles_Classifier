The first new train line built in Britain in more than a century, the route runs 30 miles from the capital to Tweedbank in just under an hour, providing access to attractions including the 15th -century Rosslyn Chapel, popularized in the film “The Da Vinci Code,” and Abbotsford House, former home of Sir Walter Scott. Special steam trains with refurbished vintage carriages will run on the line most Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays through Oct. 18, with tickets from £40 ($60) per adult. Regular round-trips cost £16 ($24).\nIN PORTLAND, A CAR-FREE BRIDGE (BIKES AND WALKERS WELCOME)\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
