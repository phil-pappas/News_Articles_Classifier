US actor Johnny Depp and his wife US actress Amber Heard. Source: AFP \nHOLLYWOOD actor Johnny Depp clearly still holds ill feelings towards Agricultural Minister Barnaby Joyce and took a swipe at the Queensland politician calling him a “sweaty, big-gutted man”. \nThe comments came during a Q&A session at the Venice Film Festival on Friday and suggest Depp hasn’t gotten over the minister’s threats to have his two dogs put down during a recent trip to Australia. \nWhen Depp was asked by a reporter at the event if he brought his dogs along for a gondola ride, he responded with a macabre joke that he’d killed and eaten them. \n“I killed my dogs and ate them under direct orders from some kinda, I dunno, sweaty, big-gutted man from Australia,” he said in a clear reference to Joyce. Johnny Depp has taken aim at Barnaby Joyce while making a morbid joke about his dogs. STORY: http://t.co/IYJdd9HAaq https://t.co/CgrYr4NjQO — 7 News Melbourne (@7NewsMelbourne) September 5, 2015 \nThe actor and his wife Amber Heard came under fire from authorities Down Under in May when it was discovered they had taken two Yorkshire terriers, named Pistol and Boo, into the country without filling out the proper paperwork or going through required quarantine procedures. \nThey flew the dogs back to the US via private jet after Joyce threatened to have the animals killed if they remained in the country, where Depp was filming the next Pirates of the Caribbean movie. \nThe incident drew international headlines at the time and led radio host Kyle Sandilands to call Minister Joyce a “w---ker”. \nThe 52-year-old is now facing a possible 10-year prison sentence and a hefty fine for illegally smuggling the pooches into Australia, while Heard has been summoned to appear in court in Queensland on Monday to answer two charges of illegal importation and one count of producing a false document after she was served with the legal documents in July. \nShe had previously blasted Joyce as a “rogue thug” for threatening her dogs’ lives, adding, “It’s a sad state of affairs that made such headline global news.” Johnny Depp is clearly not happy with Barnaby.
