In 2012, his wife urged him to reach out to K9s for Warriors, which is how he met a German shepherd named Axel. \nFor this lifesaving work, Axel was named the winner in the Service Dog category at the 2015 American Humane Association Hero Dog Awards on Saturday night. \nAxel was denied entry on the flight, despite the air carrier´s own requirements having been followed. \nAmerican Airlines later issued an apology, and the American Humane Association is calling on them and all airlines to better train their staff to meet the needs of our nation´s brave veterans and others who require the help of a service animal.
