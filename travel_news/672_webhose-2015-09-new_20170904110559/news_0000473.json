Many fans look for businesses with Packer game specials, and Kettle Hills plans to use that trend with their golf special. If the Packers are playing a game Sunday afternoon at either noon or 3PM, then guests will be able to golf at Kettle Hills for a discounted price of $60 per twosome. The Packer game special includes 18 holes, a golf cart, and brats and hotdogs for the golfers. There will be drink specials and big screen TVs set up where players can watch the game after their round.\nLast season Kettle Hills offered these deals to encourage fall golfing , and it was a remarkable success. Due to the success of this promotion, guests will need to make reservations nine days in advance.\nGolf is one of the favorite pastimes of Wisconsin residents during the summer months, and Packer games are of course a favorite during the fall, so Kettle Hills hopes to combine these loves on their championship golf course. It just so happens that the courses at Kettle Hills offer some of the best fall color views in the area. Interested golfers can book online or call at 262-628-0200.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXR0bGVoaWxscy5jb20=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXR0bGVoaWxscy5jb20vaGlzdG9yeQ==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXR0bGVoaWxscy5jb20vY29udGFjdC11cy8=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5rZXR0bGVoaWxscy5jb20vb25saW5lLXRlZS10aW1lcy8="], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T01:03:26.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
