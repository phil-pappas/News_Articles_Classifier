It is foliage time. It’s happening now, right?\nA. We’re just about to get to some beautiful colors here in the Northeast Kingdom. It comes a little bit sooner in our region of the state than it does in southern and central Vermont, because of course we’re a little bit further north. So our peak time frames are really the last week of September and the first week of October. So we’re gearing for foliage festivals, harvest festivals, things of that nature.\nQ. Can you talk a little bit about the cycling up in Essex County?\nA. One of the great things about Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom is that you’re more likely to come across cattle crossings than you are traffic lights. It’s a really quiet area … which, as a cyclist, is really nice because it allows you to really kind of relax. You don’t have to have that hyperalert feeling as cars are weaving around you … Up in Essex County, they have a route, it’s actually a cycling loop, called Mostly Moose, and it got its name because that’s primarily what you see.\nRight in the hub of that circle is the Silvio O. Conte Wildlife Refuge, and it’s an area that you are really likely to encounter some great wildlife as you ride.\nQ. Tell people who are making the silly mistake of going this weekend to New Hampshire or Rhode Island, tell them why they should head up to Vermont and the Northeast Kingdom.\nA. One of the great things about the Northeast Kingdom is that it still has an element of being undiscovered to a large degree, that it’s an emerging destination. We’re one of the National Geographic geotourism destinations, which means everything that we do we really have an eye and a focus on encouraging sustainability. So when folks come to this area, we’re trying to connect them not with a manufactured tourism experience but with who we are and what we do and how we live our daily lives. And, so, you can go to the Vermont reindeer farm, and it’s a beautiful little functioning farm up here in Charleston, and get to know the folks that run it. Or, you can go to the great Vermont corn maze and connect with Mike and Dana. They’ve been installing that corn maze to keep their family’s agricultural lands for years. So we’re welcoming visitors here in a unique and different way and in a way that helps us to protect and preserve the things we love about our home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T08:35:40.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
