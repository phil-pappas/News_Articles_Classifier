She is from Paris and she says shes pregnant, but she doesnt know who the father is. Courtesy Natalie Amyot/YouTube News Corp Australia 02 Sep 2015 Lifestyle Natalie Amyot has started a desperate search for the father of her unborn baby. Source: YouTube \nA FRENCH tourist who started an online search for the Queensland father of her unborn child says has been overwhelmed with both support and hate after a video she posted about her mission hit headlines. \nFacebook user Natalie Amyot uploaded a video pleading with Sunshine Coast locals to help her find the blue-eyed blond-haired mystery man she spent a “beautiful” night with in one of the beach’s pubs three months ago. \nThe young woman details a night spent at O’Malleys Irish pub in Mooloolaba, where she experienced “love at first sight” during her recent trip to Australia. \n“I had an amazing time, I met amazing people. On the last night, we had a party, we went to O’Malley’s and Wharf Tavern and I met this really cute guy,” she says. \n“We had a beautiful night and the next morning I flew back to Paris and lost my phone with his number on it so I have no way to contact him and six weeks later I found out I was pregnant.” \nMs Amyot says she now has “no way to contact him” and says she has returned to the Sunshine Coast to track down her lover. \nThe young woman says she has been overwhelmed with support since the video she posted has clocked up more than 450,00 views. \nOn the Facebook page that appears to have been set up specifically to aid the search she wrote: “Thank you for the kind thoughts. your support has made me cry”. \nBut not all of the attention on Ms Amyot has been positive, with many saying the mission is a fake, attention-seeking stunt, and that the French woman has assumed a false identity. \nMany commenters theorised the whole thing could be a setup to promote tourism, though the Sunshine Coast official tourism body has denied involvement. \n“If you all want to try and think this is fake ill delete all pages and go home. then be proud as you bullied a mum and baby and father away ... if that's what you want ill go home tmrw (sic),” she wrote. \nThe desperate mum-to-be has formulated a plan to visit the same bars she visited the night she says she fell pregnant, and plans to enlist the help of bouncers on the esplanade — Mooloolaba’s nightclub strip. \n“If people would like to try to help me and come and really help me then come and we go together ... I have 3 days ... I’ll try anything.” \nThe young woman says she has been overwhelmed with the coverage her video has received, sparking the attention of international media. \n“I didn’t think it would be on the news ... I just want to see him again,” she wrote. \n“If I don’t find him I’ll go home ... I just want to see.” \nThe man fits the description of at least half of all Sunshine Coast men: about 180cm tall, tanned with blue eyes and blond hair. \nIl n'y a qu'un bonheur dans la vie, c'est d'aimer et d'être aimé. \"There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved\" - your support and help has made me cry x x x", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T02:31:37.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
