Ideally, get cruise control. The loop has great roads and there are plenty of long, two-lane highways, with speed limits that range between 90km/h and 120km/h. Setting your speed helps reduce fatigue and allows more time to take in the views.\nAlso consider bringing along or hiring a GPS. And if you really want that extra bit of “back home” reassurance, choose the GPS voice with the Australian accent.\n2. Plan your route thoroughly before departing, including which towns you want to visit and for how many nights. Also pre-book your lodgings – there’s nothing worse than arriving at an unfamiliar destination late in the day, not knowing where you’re bedding down for the night.\nThere are numerous routes for the loop. For a six-night return drive, you could consider Vancouver to Kelowna (about four hours’ drive, stay one night); Kelowna to Banff/Canmore (about six hours’ drive, stay two nights); Banff/Canmore to Jasper (about four hours’ drive, stay two nights); Jasper to Clearwater (about four hours, stay one night); and Clearwater to Vancouver (about six hours’ drive). Keep in mind these are drive times only; you’ll want to spend more time taking breaks and stopping off to gawk at the stunning vistas.\n Lake Moraine, in Banff National Park, is a stunning blue.

Grizzly bears, black bears, elk, moose, mountain goat, caribou, or coyote … chances are you’re going to see some of these or many other animals that heavily populate the areas in the British Columbia/Alberta loop drive. A lot of it comes down to luck, but one tip to help ensure successful wildlife spotting is to keep a close eye on other drivers.\nWhen you see a bunch of vehicles inexplicably stopped on the side of the road with hazard lights flashing, you’ve probably hit a jackpot.\nChances are that just behind those bushes, you could see (as I did) a black bear and her two cubs scrounging for berries.\n4. Located within the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Banff National Park, Banff is a resort town and one of Canada’s most popular tourist destinations.\nIts reputation is well-deserved, but if you’re after a similar experience without the tourist circus and fanfare, try Canmore. It’s only a 25-minute drive from Banff and has a gorgeous downtown setting with great restaurants, overlooked by the almost 3000m Three Sisters peaks. And for discerning beer drinkers, you’re in luck: The Wood Restaurant & Lounge ( thewood.ca ) has more than 20 craft beers on tap, including the sublime Stanley Park Noble Pilsner, Tree Brewing Thirsty Beaver Ale, and Yukon Megalomaniac Imperial Red Ale. The Grizzly Paw Brewing Company (goo.gl/N5E8c2) offers its own brewed craft beers, including taster sets.\n Keep a watch for wildlife such as bighorn sheep. Picture: iStock Source: Supplied\n5. Uppity Banff is definitely worth a visit, but instead of driving there from Canmore, try cycling. The 30km Rocky Mountain Legacy Trail links the two towns by many paved pathways with stunning scenery.\nThe route, which is open between mid-April and mid-October (weather permitting), takes about 90 minutes one way. For a refreshment after arrival, visit historic Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel ( goo.gl/xiRdOJ ), which perches over Bow River.\nIf you’re keen to cycle, try staying at a Canmore hotel that offers free bicycle use, such as The Paintbox Lodge ( paintboxlodge.com ). If not, you can hire a bike for about $50 a day ( gearupsport.com ).\n6. If you’re doing the Banff/Canmore to Jasper drive in one day, be sure to start early. This trip is arguably the highlight of the entire route and you’ll be rubbernecking the entire way. Just 40 minutes up the road from Banff is Lake Louise, a gorgeous turquoise-tinted body of water overlooked by chiselled snow-capped peaks. Consider a coffee inside the iconic Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise Hotel ( goo.gl/Ao64WZ ), which sits right on the foreshore.\n7. Don’t discount a quick side-trip to the much quieter Moraine Lake 30 minutes away. Situated in the Valley of the Ten Peaks, the colour of the glacially fed body of water is a unique and stunning blue – due to the refraction of light off silt-sized particles of rock continually deposited into the lake.\n Settle in for a beer taster set at Grizzly Paw Restaurant in Canmore.

It feeds many glaciers, including Athabasca, which you can visit in a specially designed vehicle. Tour company Brewster Travel Canada ( goo.gl/1p212D ) offer 80-minute tours for $58.\n9. Hard to imagine, but as a bigger and less visited area with even more wildlife, the World Heritage-listed Jasper National Park actually outdoes Banff. However, it’s not always about looking at what’s on the ground during daylight hours, because at night Jasper is a dazzling wilderness of stars. The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada designated the 11,000sq km park a Dark Sky Preserve in 2011 due to its limited light pollution. The Jasper Dark Sky Festival runs from October 16-25, 2015 ( goo.gl/EnQ2Pg ).\n10. As someone repulsed by chain restaurants, I’m a little sheepish to admit I’ve become a convert to Tim Hortons. These fast-food eateries offer a healthy and wide choice and dot highways — a welcome respite after hundreds of kilometres of moose spotting and elk gazing. Go on, try one of their iced cappuccinos ... you’ll convert, too.\nGO2\nCANADA\nGETTING THERE\nQantas and Air Canada fly to Vancouver.\nSTAYING THERE\nKelowna: The Royal Anne Hotel, see royalannehotel.com\nCanmore: The Paintbox Lodge, see paintboxlodge.com\nJasper: Alpine Village, see alpinevillagejasper.com\nClearwater: The Alpine Meadows Lodge, see alpinemeadowsresort.com\nTRAVEL TIP\nKeep an eye on the province borders, which you’ll crisscross.
