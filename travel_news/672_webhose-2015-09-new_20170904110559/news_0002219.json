Additionally, Panasonic will be providing their new AirMap suite of products enabling Aeronautical Operation Control (AOC) fleet communications, management, and aircraft tracking.\nFlightLink will be initially installed on 90 Airbus A320s to ensure the aircraft will be connected to the airline's ground operations 24 hours a day.\nAnaz Tajuddin , Group Head of Engineering for AirAsia said, \"Given our unique route structure, we needed a single supplier that could provide both the hardware and service needed to maintain constant contact with our aircraft everywhere we fly. Ensuring the highest level of safety and operational efficiency is our top priority and Panasonic's FlightLink service was the best choice for ubiquitous communications and flight tracking our fleet of A320s.\"\nPanasonic's FlightLink uses Iridium's global satellite-based communications system to support flight deck voice and data communication, as well as autonomous GPS-based flight tracking, in all areas AirAsia flies. Additionally, the system provides fully integrated data communications for the aircraft's ACARS system and Electronic Flight Bags (EFBs).\nAirAsia is also installing Panasonic's Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting (TAMDAR) atmospheric sensor, the aviation industry's most advanced airborne weather instrument, enabling improved flight planning and situational display of atmospheric conditions, including icing and turbulence.\nPanasonic Avionics CEO Paul Margis said: \"Our decade old vision of the connected aircraft has become a reality. This collaboration with a forward-looking airline like AirAsia is the proof of the business and safety improvement potential of our suite of services. Together, we're ensuring constant situational awareness and communications with AirAsia's aircraft - no matter where they fly.\"\nMargis continued, \"This is a perfect example of how an airline can look to us to satisfy their critical communications and situational awareness needs, while concurrently improving their operational safety and efficiency. Panasonic is uniquely positioned to offer both the hardware and service provision of Iridium's satellite communications.\"\nAs part of the overall solution, Panasonic has partnered in this offering with UTC Aerospace Systems (UTAS). UTAS is supplying key enabling components to the EFB installation on these aircraft, including the onboard Aircraft Interface Device (AID), Tablet Interface Modules (TIM), and associated EFB mounting hardware and brackets.\nAbout Panasonic Avionics Corporation\nPanasonic Avionics Corporation is the world's leading supplier of inflight entertainment and communication systems.
