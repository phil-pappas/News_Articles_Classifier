Wealthier men and people who were more confident in their appearance had stronger preferences for a good looking partner,\" Frederick, an assistant professor of psychology, said. \nThe study took a \"mating market\" approach which is defined as heterosexual individuals competing with others of the same gender to make \"bids\" to members of the other gender for the purpose of securing a romantic partner. Previous studies have shown that men care more about attractiveness in a long term partner, and women care more about resources.

Wealthier women had stronger preferences for men who had a steady income or made lots of money. \nMen with more education had stronger preferences for female partners who are good looking and slender.
