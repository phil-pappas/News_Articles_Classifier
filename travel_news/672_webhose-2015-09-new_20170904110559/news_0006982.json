Located at 123 North Highland Avenue, this unique hotel is both an adaptive reuse and new build property comprised of four buildings representing four different eras of Pittsburgh’s history, including the building that formerly housed the Governor Hotel. The boutique hotel sits in the heart of Pittsburgh’s rejuvenated and thriving cultural district making it easy to discover the local neighborhood scene.\nJason Moskal, Vice President, Lifestyle Brands, The Americas, IHG said: “Pittsburgh is one of the fastest growing hotel markets in the country. As the high demand for boutique hotels continues to grow, the Hotel Indigo® brand is bringing Pittsburgh’s East Liberty a unique hotel offer which reflects the local culture, character and history of the neighborhood. Guests will be inspired by the majestic theatre era of East Liberty’s past which is seamlessly integrated into the design and service of the stylish Hotel Indigo Pittsburgh East Liberty.”\nEast Liberty’s nightlife and theatre scene was first brought to life by innovators such as Carnegie and Mellon, and is now a flourishing cultural center with several art venues, trendy boutiques and historic sites. When guests first arrive at the Hotel Indigo Pittsburgh East Liberty, they will be greeted by staff outfitted in uniforms custom created by local designer Kiya Tomlin. Guests will immediately be drawn further into the hotel by the art, photography and architecture incorporated into the hotel’s design which uniquely brings East Liberty’s theatrical neighborhood story to life at every touch point. The guest room décor features a nod to the majestic theatre era with a velvet curtain entrance, theatre inspired murals and lamps designed to mirror stage lights, while photo stills of vintage movie Academy Leaders mark each floor in front of the guest elevators.\nAt the hotel’s restaurant and bar, Wallace’s TapRoom, guests can enjoy an American Tavern style menu along with one of many signature cocktails including the S’Liberty Swizzle. The drink features rum hailing from local distillery Wigle’s Craft Sprits which was the first distillery in Pittsburgh since prohibition, and the only one still currently in the region. The hotel also offers guests and locals the opportunity to enjoy seasonal and locally sourced food and drinks from purveyors such as Zeke’s Coffee, Natrona Bottling, Mediterra Bake House, Thoma Meat Market, Turner Dairy and Emerald Valley Artisans.\nJordan Bartels, General Manager, said: “When guests stay at the Hotel Indigo Pittsburgh East Liberty they will find many of the best neighborhood sites within walking distance of the hotel. Whether it’s seeing an original show at the Kelly Strayhorn Theatre, taking in the dynamic arts scene or trying out the latest dining destination in the East End, we look forward to connecting guests with everything the East Liberty neighborhood has to offer.”\nGuestrooms feature plush bedding, hard-surface flooring with area rugs and spa-inspired bathrooms. In addition, the hotel features a two-room Governor’s Suite which offers a private sitting parlor, bar area and master suite with a separate powder room. Guests also have access to a 24-hour fitness center and 2,400 sq. ft. of meeting space. The Pittsburgh hotel features the brand’s Neighborhood Guide, an innovative touchscreen display that connects guests to each other, the local neighborhood and to Hotel Indigo locations around the world. Hotel team members, many of whom are locals themselves, will share their favorite hidden gems with guests looking to explore and discover the neighborhood.\nThe Hotel Indigo Pittsburgh East Liberty hotel is owned by Governor’s Hotel Company, and managed by IHG. The Hotel Indigo brand is part of IHG’s diverse family of brands in nearly 100 countries and territories.
