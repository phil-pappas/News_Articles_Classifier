In an exclusive conversation with Travel And Tour World and All Points East, the UK and Asian based travel company, they clearly stated why one needs to hire a travel agent. If you are traveling for the first time, it is advisable to hire the tour agents as they have the in depth knowledge of the region. More importantly, only a regional specialist will offer attention to detail and the professional knowledge and experience will help in planning innovative as well as safe and exciting itineraries to the destination of the visitor’s choice.\nWe asked if the low-cost booking sites affected the travel agent business however All Points East spoke about themselves who are not in the low cost market. Moreover, it is rare that you can find a tour agent who will be able to offer a budget travel.\nThe advent of technology is bringing wide changes in the tourism industry. So we were apprehensive whether the future generation would be interested in employing the services of travel agencies to plan trips where everything is possible to do online. “A Google search does not replace in-depth knowledge of a region or years of experience of planning trips. Almost everyone we speak to says “oh I hadn’t thought of that” when we discuss their travel plans with them”, is what All Points East had to say.\nApart from the traditional practices, the new means of communication involves Skype, Live-chat, twitter etc. which provides quick response to the different requests and communicate to the new ideas and locations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T14:48:04.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
