Nearly half returned later when the country embraced democracy.\nEurope’s worst migration crisis since World War II has sparked concern in some quarters, as many of those taking the perilous journey are Muslim.\nIn France, several mayors said they would only take in Christian refugees, earning them a rebuke from the government.\nThe issue has played into the hands of the far-right across Europe, which hopes to turn fears of an “invasion” into electoral success.\nBulgaria’s Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said, on Friday, he was “concerned” over a potential massive influx of migrants in the coming months.\n“I’m scared and the Bulgarian people are scared, if only where religions are concerned. We are Christian, they are Muslim.”\n World Bulgaria Europe migrants Also Read Islamic State releases interview with captive Jordanian pilot Book says MH370 was shot down North Korea threatens strikes on White House, condemns US-South Korea joint exercise Pakistan shuts down offices of 'Save the Children', says officials", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://m.deccanchronicle.com/150927/world-europe/article/prevent-invasion-muslim-migrants-bulgaria’s-orthodox-church", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/miogrants%20copy_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/miogrants%20copy_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T15:50:40.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
