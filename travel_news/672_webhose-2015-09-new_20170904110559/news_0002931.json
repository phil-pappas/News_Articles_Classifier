These themes are structural changes that they believe will bring significant benefits to companies understanding the opportunities that lay ahead of them. Energy efficiency is one of these themes, and Alexandre Werbowy, Alliance Trust investment analyst, uses the McKinsey greenhouse gas abatement cost curve to demonstrate how they see energy efficiency as an opportunity for investment. “Energy efficiency is important and the graph is a good summary of our framework,” he says. “However we do take into consideration several other factors as well as a company’s exposure to this theme.” In addition to this cost-benefit analysis, Mr Werbowy looks at regional trends, timing, value chain and competitive environment, as well as valuation of the companies he deems interesting. With this in mind, a review of the Lighting sector – seen at the bottom hand left corner of the McKinsey graph – pointed to Acuity Brands, a company that he believes will do well out of the need for energy conservation. The company established itself as a market leader in LED lighting in the USA. These products have become increasingly popular, largely because they require much less energy and last longer than incandescent lights, saving customers money. Non-residential users were first to shift to LED as it also cuts the cost of expensive maintenance. Because the cost of LED bulbs has fallen, the payback period has significantly shortened, and increasing numbers of residential households now also use LED. Acuity’s last reported quarter shows that LED now represents over 40 per cent of total revenue, and this segment grew 60 per cent year-on-year. Another company that plays to the energy-efficiency theme is Kingspan. The Irish building materials company reinvented itself as an energy-efficiency giant by choosing to focus on building insulation. “These products have very good thermal efficiency, that outperforms competitors’ products, and over 80 per cent of the company’s sales are now derived from insulation,” Mr Werbowy says. “Insulation of buildings is one of the most cost-effective, energy-efficient strategies and is seeing a strong take-up, driven by more stringent building standards.” Mr Werbowy points out that at the end of 2013, Kingspan calculated that its insulation products saved over 126,600 kWh per year – equivalent to the annual output of 90 gas-fired or 23 coal-fired power plants, or up to three times the annual electricity consumption of Greater London. Kingspan announced a 21 per cent increase in its 2014 trading profits year-on-year, with revenue up 6 per cent, and its share price has in absolute terms more than tripled over the last three years. Schneider Electric, is also a core holding. It is a global specialist in energy management and efficiency as well as automation for industrial and residential buildings. The company focuses on automating energy efficiency, using sensors and software to reduce energy use in buildings, such as hospitals and data centres. The French-listed company has a balance of sales across emerging and developed economies. It is estimated that around 50 per cent of its sales are derived from products and services related to energy efficiency. While making energy-efficient products and providing energy-efficient services is an important indicator of company success for Alliance Trust, Mr Werbowy says that it is also vital to meet with a company’s management before investing. “It’s not just about the products and services offered by the company, but the way it is managed is also important,” he says. “Good execution, clear, sound strategy and capital allocation are key.” He praises Kingspan, “a really well managed company”, which has expanded cautiously, helping the business to avoid issues that rivals have faced when going into new and very risky markets too fast. Although the recent fall in the oil price may have somewhat lessened the economic attractiveness of energy efficient products, Mr Werbowy believes that this is a blip. “Energy efficiency will continue to be a really important part of the agenda. Companies need to always improve their cost base” he says. Another obvious driver of the energy-efficiency agenda is regulation, which Mr Werbowy says is becoming “more stringent”. “We are at the beginning of major changes in energy efficiency,” he says. “Integration of renewables, combined with higher performance of energy storage, only makes sense if you have a digital and automated grid – aka Smart Grid – to manage efficiently energy. We are still far away from mainstream adoption, but the technology is here. Costs will come down, the payback period will become more attractive and regulation will help. Some companies we are looking at are already very well positioned and have created big opportunities for our Sustainable Future funds”. Risk information Please note the value of investments and any income from them can go down as well as up. Your capital is at risk and you may not get back what you originally invested. Funds which undertake ethical screening to meet their investment aims are unable to invest in certain sectors and companies. Our exclusion of some areas of the market (on ESG grounds) may result in periods of under-performance with respect to relevant benchmarks. For instance if tobacco stocks were enjoying extremely strong returns we would not be able to participate in their gains.

It is not a recommendation to buy or sell and the view of the Investment Manager may have changed.
