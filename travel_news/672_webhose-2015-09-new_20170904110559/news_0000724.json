Share this article Share 2.6k shares\n'It was clear something was up because having a picture on your iPhone of a shirtless monk laying down in what looks like a locker room is definitely something you would remember taking,' Scott wrote.\nBut, as the pair were on the move constantly - and often without WiFi - they still had no idea what exactly was going on.\nWhen the first image appeared, Scott wrote off the occurrence as simply a strange incident\nHowever, over the next few days, it became clear that someone had found his iPod and was continuing to use it\nScott and his travelling partner Megan dubbed the man: 'the monk that lives in my phone,' as he seemingly forgot to log out of Scott's iCloud account\nAny time that Scott would stumble across WiFi access and log in to his iCloud service, he would find a new photo\nFinally, they stumbled upon some good Internet access and found over 100 new photos on Scott's phone.\nIt was then that Scott first began to think about how exactly he was getting all of these monk photos directly to his account, before remembering that about a month prior, he had lost his iPod Touch.\nAfter a nine hour bus ride, a grumpy Scott had left his iPod on a table outside of a restaurant.\n'I lost it in the middle of commuting from one city to the next,' he tells MailOnline Travel.\nIt turns out that the monk in his phone is an avid selfie-taker, posting many pictures of both him alone and with his friends\nThe monk in Scott's phone also shows them what day to day life looks like for those living in Laos\nThe monk is a bit of a goof, showing off his silliness in a series of baseball cap-wearing shots\nIt's also clear that he's very sociable, making friends - and taking photos with - tourists wherever he goes\nWhether posing in his home (left) or travelling on a tuktuk (left), the monk is keen to document his travels\nAt some point, he even went to a traditional ceremony, though Scott and Megan admit they don't know what it is\n'Most of the time when you lose something, it sucks,' he wrote. 'You're furious at the world and want to kick some teeth in. However, it appeared something amazing was happening.'\nThe person who took his iPod had clearly never logged out of Scott's iCloud services and whenever Scott and Megan found WiFi, new photographs would upload to his iCloud account.\n'It was like I was seeing a whole new world,' he blogged. 'I was getting a rare glimpse into this monk's life and it became fun to see where this guy was going.'\nScott and his travelling partner Megan (pictured) have spent the last eight months in Southeast Asia\nWorld traveller! Just like Scott and Megan, the monk in his phone has visited several tourist spots - like Thailand's Grand Palace\n'It appears he is currently in Vientiane working on his fisheye and forced perspective game,' Scott wrote\n'It's hard to pick a favourite,' Scott tells MailOnline Travel. 'But I guess the one where all the monks are posing and bending over. I really like the human aspect of how we are all just people having fun. I can really relate to that.'\nScott has now finished his eight-month trek and has settled in South Korea to teach English, though he hopes that by posting these images to his blog and Instagram, he might be able to one day meet the monk in question.\n'I have not attempted to contact him, but I'm hoping to be able to reach out to him,' he adds. 'It would be amazing to be able to meet him and hear about it from his point of view. Perhaps the magical powers of the Internet could bring us together.'\nRead more: Bobo and ChiChi - Traveling the world.
