It allows individuals, travel manage­ment companies (TMCs) and corporates to shop across multiple hotels over several days to take advantage of rate changes.\nBCD Travel is a leading TMC and was named number four in BBT’s Top 50 TMCs.\n“Hotel rates change constantly; it only makes sense that we secure lower rates for our travelers whenever they become available,” said BCD Travel senior VP of strategic marketing April Bridgeman.\n“However, Tripbam’s offering does much more – by steering travelers toward preferred properties and chains and even toward lower-cost comparable properties, it can unlock meaningful savings opportunities,\" she added.\nTripbam founder and CEO Steve Reynolds (pictured) said: “We’re excited about the opportunity to help drive better hotel program performance for BCD Travel and its corporate clients.\n“BCD Travel remains a leader at implementing new technologies to enhance all components of the managed travel process. We look forward to working with BCD to move the needle on use of corporate hotel programs.”\nTo read BBT’s interview with CEO Reynolds click here", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-09-10T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:04:02.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
