That's the concept behind Autotrader's new B2B advertising campaign, \"Bring Your A-Game,\" which launched this month. More than a campaign slogan, \"Bring Your A-Game\" is a rally cry for dealers that captures the raw emotion of working hard, giving it everything you've got, and ultimately, winning. It also embodies the internal motivation for everyone at Autotrader to continue delivering best-in-class products and services that help dealers succeed in the ever-evolving car shopping environment.\n\"Dealers should have high expectations of their business partners, and this campaign is as much a commitment to them that we will bring our A-Game as it is a statement on how we are uniquely equipped to help them bring theirs,\" said Jared Rowe , who leads Autotrader as president of the Cox Automotive Media Division. \"We have the industry's most well-trained sales force that partners closely with our dealer customers every day to deliver a strong portfolio of digital marketing solutions, actionable insights and local market guidance-all with the goal of helping our dealers connect with, and influence, the millions of highly engaged car shoppers on our site.\"\nThrough print, digital and multimedia creative assets, the \"Bring Your A Game\" campaign showcases the essence of the new Autotrader and highlights four key strengths that differentiate it from the competition:\nDigital Marketing Solutions: Autotrader offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions that enables dealers to develop effective digital marketing strategies to build their brands, drive traffic and connect their online and in-store experiences. Shopper Insights: Autotrader's unique and leading insights help dealers stay on top of consumer trends and better connect and engage today's empowered shoppers. Local Market Guidance: Autotrader helps dealers understand their local markets with the most relevant information about their local market, shoppers and competition to help inform savvy business decisions. Audience & Influence: Dealers can reach the biggest online car buying and selling marketplaces with the most engaged, local shoppers. As a part of the continuing reinvention of Autotrader that has occurred under Rowe's leadership, Autotrader is evolving from being a marketplace that is focused on inventory and price to a matchmaker that will enable dealers and consumers to connect on the third dimension of the car shopping process-experience.\n\"We will continue bringing our 'A-Game' to our customers by enabling them to connect with buyers in new and different ways,\" Rowe continued. \"As we evolve our site to give dealers more, and better, options to communicate their unique selling propositions, we are equally focused on the experience that dealers have in doing business with us. Our goal is that the new Autotrader-new in attitude as well as in appearance-will be even more satisfying for dealers.\"\nFor more information, go to Agame.autotrader.com .\nAbout Autotrader\nCreated in 1997, Atlanta -based Autotrader is the Internet's ultimate automotive marketplace.
