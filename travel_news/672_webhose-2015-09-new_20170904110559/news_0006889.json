(Photo: chattanoogafun.com)\n279 CONNECT 97 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Travelers don’t have to head to big national parks to find outdoor adventures. More small towns are developing places for biking, climbing, kayaking and more, says Jonah Ogles , senior editor with Outside magazine. “These are places where people are really happy to live, and are willing to donate their time, money or energy to make things happen” like trails, parks and races. The publication ranks top adventure towns in its September issue, and Ogles shares some of his favorites with Larry Bleiberg for USA TODAY.\nChattanooga, Tenn.\nChattanooga became the darling of urban planners back in the 1990s, when it redeveloped its pedestrian-friendly downtown, centered on a new aquarium. Decades later, the area has only gotten cooler with a rock-climbers’ hostel, whitewater rafting courses, and biking along the Tennessee River. “This is one of the rising stars of the South,” Ogles says. 800-322-3344; chattanoogafun.com\nPort Angeles, Wash.\nThere’s Pacific surfing and sea kayaking on your front door, and Olympic National Park hiking, camping and exploring behind you at this working-class town on the north shore of the Olympic Peninsula. “You have everything you want to do on land, and the water is all there for you,” Ogles says. 360-452-2363; portangeles.org\nIowa City\nThe flatlands surrounding this vibrant college town offer their share of adventure with great opportunities for biking, particularly gravel-grinding, a growing trend of riding on rough roads and off-trail. “You need long stretches of unpaved roads and Iowa has it. That’s really opened up people’s options for activities there,” Ogles says. 319-337-6592.; iowacitycoralville.org\nBar Harbor, Maine\nMost know this Atlantic coast gem as the gateway to Acadia National Park. But it also shines off-season when the summer crowds disappear, offering a chance for fall hikes and fat-tire cycling through snow, Ogles says. “You can go on long, long bike rides and not see a person,” says. “Once the crowds go, you see how fun these touristy towns can be.” 800-345-4617; barharborinfo.com\nPagosa Springs, Colo.\nOgles loves this tiny Southern Colorado ranching town within driving distance of his Santa Fe office. It offers biking and fishing, and skiing at nearby Wolf Creek, which records some of the deepest snowfall in the country. “It’s at the entrance of the San Juan Mountains, which in my mind are some of the most amazing mountains in the United States,” he says. “It’s just empty out there.” 866-438-4917; visitpagosasprings.com\nAnnapolis, Md.\nIf you love water and you’re on the East Coast, you’re going to enjoy this historic state capital on the Chesapeake, with easy access to kayaking, paddleboarding and more. “For sailing, it’s just one of the best towns, and it’s a very livable place. It’s near D.C., with plenty to do,” says Ogles. 888-731-7882; visitannapolis.org\nSpearfish, S.D.\nThis Black Hills town keeps cyclists happy year-round with fat-tire races through snow and off-road biking year-round. “Its location near the Black Hills gives you some topographic relief that’s necessary for the activities we like,” Ogles says. “This is a pretty happening bike town, and they’ve got a couple big races.” 605-717-9295; visitspearfish.com\nBeaufort, S.C.\nLife centers around water at this historic city, with everything from sea kayaking and sailing in the Atlantic, to paddling on inland rivers and marshes. “It almost seems a little bit like Charleston. You’ve got a thriving foodie scene with all that great seafood. It’s not quite as touristy, but it has all the great stuff you can expect from a coastal town,” Ogles says. 843-525-8500; beaufortsc.org\nFlagstaff, Ariz.\nYou won’t find scorching Arizona heat in this high-desert city near forest, mountains, skiing, bike trails and the Grand Canyon. The city’s home to Colorado River raft guides, students from Northern Arizona University, hippies and ranchers. “It’s a really cool mix of people,” Ogles says. 800-379-0065; flagstaffarizona.org\nLake Placid, N.Y.\nThis two-time Winter Olympics host city welcomes the public at sites like the skating and hockey rinks, where a young Team USA beat the Soviet Union in 1980’s “Miracle on Ice” game. There’s also downhill and cross-country skiing, and more. “It’s one of the few places you can do luge runs and things like that,” Ogles says. 518-523-2445; lakeplacid.com\n279 CONNECT 97 TWEET 2
