It will finally have its own professional soccer team that will compete at the highest level. Interest in having professional soccer has been strong, but there were limitations in the ability to attract one of the existing franchise teams of North America to this location. The new soccer team is called the Sprinter Football Club, Peter Schuh , CEO announced today. Last week the United States Securities and Exchange Commission accepted the application for review of the Initial Public Offering. Final approval is expected within about 45 days if all goes according to schedule. \"You will start to see the logo around town ,\" Schuh said. \"It is a yellow triangle with a sprinter on it chasing a soccer ball. Yes, a sprinter. The emphasis is on speed with this team, it is our defining strategic advantage.\"Appropriately, the name is Sprinter Football Club. To fans around the world the term football refers to soccer as it is known here. As the team will have an international presence, the international designation of Football Club was adopted so as to avoid the confusion with NFL football which is an American invention and not that much played elsewhere. The team management and training infrastructure is forming now. Players will be recruited after that. Serious game playing is still several months away, perhaps not until 2016. The strategic advantage of the Metropolitan San Diego area is its ideal climate year round, everyone knows that. At first the team will travel and play in host stadiums and rented fields if playing locally. Within a year or so the team hopes to build its own soccer exclusive stadium. It is planned for about 55,000 fans seating capacity. It is planned to be self funded with no taxpayer assistance required. Locals should appreciate that. It is also planned to be near public transportation routes. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-13T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T09:51:31.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
