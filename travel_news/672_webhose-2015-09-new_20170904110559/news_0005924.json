The walk up there is also pretty hard, and many tourists are not prepared for that part either.\" \nThe number of people who completed the four-hour trek to Trolltunga increased from 500 in 2009, to 40,000 last year, and images appearing on social media seem to have raised the bar for dangerous stunts for photos. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T12:15:17.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
