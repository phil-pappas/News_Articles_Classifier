Like its Parisian inspiration, the statue-encircled cupola rests on twin rings of windowed galleries.\nThe murals at the next-door Bellas Artes feature an unfinished work by leading 20th century artist David Alfaro Siqueiros, whose students in New York included Jackson Pollock, offering a taste of abstractionism.\nAcross the street, Galeria Noel Cayetano specializes in contemporary Oaxacan art, which blends modern motifs with native animal and spirit imagery.\nThe style's best-known practitioner, Francisco Toledo, is Mexico's highest-priced living artist, with one painting selling for over $900,000.\nLower-priced Toledo engravings and Toledo-designed houseware and jewelry are offered at Galeria Nudo, also focused on art from Oaxaca, a southern state with thriving Indian traditions and languages.\nSan Miguel's biggest art hub is the 40-gallery Fabrica La Aurora, a former textile mill.\nOften overlooked by visitors are extensive folk art museums like the Mask Museum and the four-floor Mexican Popular Toy Museum, which includes many whimsical exhibits.\nOne toy has a conveyor belt that shuttles a wedding party - flanked by a priest, skeleton and devil - between church and cemetery. Another is in the form of a barracuda-like airliner that bares its teeth, arching its tail upwards.\nIn Atotonilco, 12 km away, the museum-scale Galeria Atotonilco sells more than 1,000 folk art pieces crafted by scores of top-notch artisans from about a third of Mexico's 31 states.\nNearby is the religious Atotonilco Sanctuary, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nUNESCO calls Atotonilco's interior church decoration a masterpiece of 18th-century Mexican baroque art, particularly for its murals. Others have compared the frescoes' scope, quality and biblical sweep to the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.", "external_links": ["http://whc.unesco.org/en/list", "http://www.visitmexico.com/en/san-miguel-de-allende"], "published": "2015-09-05T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T04:49:15.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
