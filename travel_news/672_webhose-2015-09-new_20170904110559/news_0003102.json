Around a third say they oppose. \n12,004 residents from Spelthorne, Richmond Park, Brentford & Isleworth, Feltham & Heston, Windsor, Ealing North, Ealing Southall, Uxbridge & South Ruislip, Slough, Hayes & Harlington, Beaconsfield and Twickenham answered questions about their feelings towards Heathrow’s plans and the airport more generally. The results show that 57% of residents feel positive about the airport while 34% have a neutral feeling with only 8% saying they have a negative feeling towards it. \nThe research is the first since the Airports Commission made a unanimous and unambiguous recommendation to Government that Heathrow should expand. It highlights a strong level of local support in the majority of the constituencies surveyed. This further demonstrates the importance of Heathrow to local residents, those mostly affected by the airport and who have traditionally been perceived as opposing the plans. \nIn its report this summer the Airports Commission said that expanding Heathrow is the only way to connect the UK to the growth markets of the world. Chair of the Commission Sir Howard Davies urged Government to make an early decision or risk the UK falling behind as an economy: \n“The Commission urges the Government to make an early decision on its recommendations. Further delay will be increasingly costly and will be seen, nationally and internationally, as a sign that the UK is unwilling or unable to take the steps needed to maintain its position as a well-connected open trading economy in the twenty first century.” \nSir Howard also confirmed that Heathrow could grow within environmental limits and operate more quietly than it does today. \n“A bigger Heathrow would not inflict noise nuisance on more people than the airport does today, and the people affected would be far better compensated. Expansion and the mitigation of the airport’s local impacts go hand in hand, as the former can provide the financial resources needed for the latter.” \nJohn Holland-Kaye, Chief Executive of Heathrow Airport said: \n“We have a completely new plan that addresses the Prime Minister’s concerns. The Airports Commission has confirmed that Heathrow expansion will keep Britain at the heart of the global economy, meets environmental targets and balances the needs of local communities. Local people support the plan along with unions, businesses and politicians across the country. Every month of delay costs Britain £1bn so let's get on with it.“ \nFollowing a challenge made to Heathrow by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) on what constitutes “local” in relation to the airport, the number of constituencies included in polling research has been increased to 12. Beaconsfield is one of the new areas polled, while Ealing North and Ealing Southall replace Ealing Central & Acton. While the ASA did not feel that Twickenham and Richmond Park are as “local” to Heathrow as other constituencies, both were kept in as residents are engaged in the issue of expansion and they were the only constituencies previously polled where opposition outweighs support. Heathrow believes that this is the fairest way to represent the combined view of local people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T03:46:02.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
