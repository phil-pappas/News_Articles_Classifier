I’m afraid I’m the chap who sent you on that walk from Killiecrankie Hotel.” “You! That walk! When I got lost for hours and nearly fell down a crevasse.” “I’m afraid so; by way of recompense, may I offer you a glass of champagne before dinner?” My visit to Killiecrankie was five years ago. In the intervening time, Tom has swapped that Perthshire hotel for this Cumbrian one, with a grandstand view of Lake Windermere. He was plainly unnerved to see me again, and his largesse didn’t stop at free champagne: we were ushered to the best window table from where the view, across the lake to the Old Man of Coniston and Langdale Pikes, with the setting sun blazing behind, was mesmerising. Dinner is a highlight at Holbeck Ghyll, built as a Victorian hunting lodge and later adorned with Arts and Crafts flourishes. The highly regarded chef, David McLaughlin, has been at the helm for 15 years and Tom runs a smooth, professional and warm operation front of house. From the canapés served in the Edwardian sitting room to the series of artfully presented dishes in the panelled dining room, it was a seamless ride.

In 2010, the hotel was sold to local entrepreneur Stephen Leahy who, if he’s around, loves to treat guests, be it a surprised bride in her wedding gown or his friend David Hasselhof, to a ride in his helicopter. He’s just spent a small fortune on a cleverly disguised state-of-the-art biomass boiler and laundry complex. Personally, I would have addressed the hotel itself first… while I warm to its traditional feel, parts, including some bedrooms, are looking dowdy. Back then, to the view. “We’ve upgraded you,” said Tom. By now I was beginning to be thoroughly pleased that fateful stroll in Perthshire had taken place. The bedrooms we were allocated had just been finished, located in the latest of a colony of unprepossessing former private houses and bungalows behind the main building. All have been transformed to provide additional, flexible accommodation (several with hot tubs – Lake District hotels, it seems, are awash with hot tubs). Easdale (£240 per night) and Bleaberry (£220) are on an upper floor, each with a wall of windows on to that heart-stopping panorama. “When I woke up this morning,” said my son Alexander, “I felt I was flying.” Talking of flying… “Would you like a ride in Stephen’s helicopter?” asked the adorable Tom, still rolling out the treats. And so up we went, wheeling over the lakes and the fells like birds on a cloudless, perfect day: an unforgettable thrill. “I have something to confess,” I told Tom as we left. “The reason I got lost on that walk was my fault; I didn’t listen properly to your directions and I didn’t deserve those treats.” “Maybe,” he replied, “but the more treats you had, the less likely you were to wander off on your own from here.” Doubles from £170 per night, including breakfast.
