This game had been billed as an early season relegation battle, but the message didn't permeate through to either side. Watford played with a freedom and verge of a team confident in its ability to stay clear of the battle for Premier League survival. Until a late revival sparked by Daryl Janmaat's 62nd minute goal, Newcastle, played in the main as though they didn't care. Ighalo fires Watford ahead As a result, the visitors sealed back-to-back victories thanks to first-half goals from Odion Ighalo, the Nigerian striker who has scored four of his side's five league goals on what an increasingly encouraging return to the top flight. Newcastle 's ineptitude played a major role in both Watford goals, the first coming in the 10th minute as Massadio Haidara was dispossessed outside his area by Almen Abdi. The midfielder crossed for Troy Deeney and Etienne Capoue to combine for Ighalo to find the bottom corner, beating Tim Krul with ease at the goalkeeper's near post. It came as little surprise when Watford doubled their advantage after 28 minutes. Fabricio Coloccini afforded Deeney time and space to bring down a long pass, before the Hornets' skipper provided a perfect through-ball for Ighalo to round Krul and stroke his shot into an unguarded net for the 26-year-old's 20th goal in 24 appearances this year. The Nigerian rounded Tim Krul to put his side two goals up If the figures trip off the tongue for Watford supporters, they prove in stark contrast to the numbers leaving Newcastle fans numb. Despite climbing off the bottom thanks to the ineptitude of their neighbours Sunderland, McClaren's side remain without a league win so far this season. They have won just three league games this year, a record only marginally less impressive than that of their head coach, who has the same number of victories since the end of February, an abject run spanning 19 games for the former Derby County manager . They at least had the consolation of finding the net for the first time since the opening weekend of the campaign, Janmaat steering a close-range finish past Heurelho Gomes from Moussa Sissoko's precise cut-back, almost eight hours' football having elapsed since supporters were able to cherish such an event. McLaren has had a terrible 2015 so far The Dutchman forced a fine save form Gomes soon afterwards, the full-back's potency an indictment as to the inadequacy of the hosts' attacking options. It had taken them almost 40 minutes to muster a serious threat on goal, Gomes beating out a shot from Florian Thauvin after the Frenchman cut in from the right to send in a long-distance effort left-footed. Janmaat's goal was scant consolation for Newcastle Papiss Cisse might have had an early penalty when he appeared to be pulled back in the area by Sebastian Prodol, but the listless forward wasn't alone in appearing hugely disinterested, his involvement lasting only until the interval when he was unsurprisingly taken off and replaced by Siem de Jong, who narrowly failed to make contact with Janmaat's cross with the goal at his mercy shortly after his introduction. Watford's Allan Nyom, left, in action with Newcastle's Ayoze Perez The Dutchman was similarly wasteful late on as he aimed a tame shot at Gomes when well placed, Watford holding out with relative ease for their first away victory of the season to leave McClaren, whose side face Chelsea and Manchester City in their two matches before the next international break, needing to find answers quickly before the car crash, pile up, call it what you will, worsens still.
