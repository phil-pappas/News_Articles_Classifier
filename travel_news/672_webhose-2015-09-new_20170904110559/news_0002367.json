Contractors are alleged to have paid off certain Petrobras directors in return for inflated contracts, which they divided up among themselves.\nSome of the kickbacks were alleged to have been paid to prominent politicians, most of them members of President Dilma Rousseff’s governing center-left coalition in the Congress.\nPetrobras estimates it lost about $2 billion dollars in the scheme, which ran from 2004 to 2014.\nSee also: Brazil S&P downgrade forces a fiscal reckoning\nThe former treasurer of Brazil’s ruling Workers’ Party João Vaccari is escorted by police officers to a medical examination after being arrested in Curitiba, Brazil, on April 16, 2015.\nAFP/Brazil Photo Press/Geraldo Bubniak\nBrazil corruption: Dilma Rousseff’s dismal ratings The scandal has dealt a major blow to Rousseff , whose approval ratings have plummeted to eight percent just eight months after her re-election to a second four-year term. Rousseff has not been personally implicated in the scandal, although she was chair of Petrobras’ board from 2003 to 2010.\nOthers have landed behind bars, however, including José Dirceu , the powerful former chief of staff of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , and executives of some of Brazil’s biggest construction companies.\nAmong those under criminal investigation are the president of Brazil’s lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, and Senator Fernando Collor, who resigned as the country’s president in 1992 amid a corruption scandal that led to his impeachment.\nRecommended: Latin America’s anti-corruption crusade", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:58:37.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
