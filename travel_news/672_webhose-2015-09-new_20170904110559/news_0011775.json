City's roadworks put on hold to ease traffic during 'big weekend' X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Highways England is pausing roadworks at Gravelly Hill to help journeys in the city go smoothly during a busy few weeks. Comments (0) \nRoadworks at a key Erdington arterial road are being suspended temporarily as Birmingham prepares for one of its busiest periods of the year. \nHighways England is pausing roadworks at Gravelly Hill to help journeys in the city go smoothly during a busy few weeks – and works will then remain on hold until the new year. \nAll Highways England cones, signs and diversions have been removed from the A38(M) Aston Expressway and at M6 junction 6 ahead of Birmingham's Big Weekend. \nNext weekend (September 26 and 27) is expected to be very busy for the city – with the relaunch of Grand Central station, the opening of a new flagship John Lewis store and Rugby World Cup games being held at Villa Park.

South Africa v Samoa will kick-off at 4.45pm on Saturday, with Australia taking on Uruguay at midday on Sunday. \nOver the same weekend, the new John Lewis store will open within the newly- refurbished Grand Central Station. \n\"Our regional control centre in Quinton, Birmingham, will monitor traffic, setting electronic signs and dispatching patrols of traffic officers to clear up any incidents as quickly as possible, to keep supporters and other motorway drivers on the move,\" explained Mr Bird. \n\"We will keep a close eye on the potential for heavy traffic before and after the game and work to help minimise queues and disruption.\" \nDrivers can plan their trips and check live travel conditions via Highways England's traffic information which can be found at www.highways.gov.uk/traffic and fans can find venue transport information at www.rugby worldcup.com/travel. \n\"We've been able to suspend work at Gravelly Hill because we'd reached the end of the first phase of the project,\" Mr Bird added. \n\"At M6 junction 9, however, we are in the middle of the second phase – and it would be dangerous, impractical and expensive to remove these roadworks. \n\"So for the time being, the Western Arm scheme will stay in place, while we work to protect and waterproof the viaduct structures so they're safe to use for years to come.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T10:50:45.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
