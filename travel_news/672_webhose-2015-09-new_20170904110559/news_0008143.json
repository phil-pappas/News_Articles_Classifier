Most of my work takes place abroad, so it has been a great way to discover new places. This year I’ve been working in Malta and Almeria, Spain, to shoot Risen [a biblical film]. Malta was used for its historic landscape while the desert backdrop of Almeria was used for its resemblance to the Holy Land. The Berghain nightclub in Berlin, Germany Photo: Alamy Favourite filming location? Berlin , where the film Spooks: The Greater Good was shot. I absolutely love Berlin. It is so striking, architecturally, and has such a young, groovy vibe. I’d heard of the exclusive club Berghain there, but I’m a little past the age of clubbing so didn’t attempt to get in. But I should have gone with Kit Harington [the Game of Thrones actor], who I was shooting with. I would’ve been let in if I said I was his uncle. I’ll definitely go with him next time I visit Berlin. Kit Harington in 'Spooks: the Greater Good', which was filmed in Berlin and London Photo: BBC Your earliest memory of travelling abroad? Going to Umbria in the Seventies when I was around 15 to shoot a film called Brother Sun, Sister Moon . I ended up staying for five months. It was such a lovely introduction to the world of travelling at such a young age. Umbria wasn’t “touristy” at all then and it felt quite medieval. What do you need for a perfect holiday? A comfy bed and to be near the sea. I love snorkelling in tropical waters. Boats in Port d?Andratx on the north coast of Majorca Photo: Alamy How do you spend your time on holiday? Largely eating, if I’m not in the water. I love discovering local cuisine. Favourite restaurant? Le Bistrot d’Antoine in Nice is a fantastic affordable place to eat and the chefs there are so creative. In St Tropez , Le Club 55 is a lovely place for lunch or an afternoon drink and people-watching. Favourite place for a drink ? The Rainbow Room at the Rockefeller Center in New York . It’s an incredible Art Deco bar that has been around since the Thirties. The exterior sign for the Rainbow Room at the Rockefeller Center, New York Photo: Alamy Favourite holiday destination? The north coast of Majorca , where I’ve been going for nearly 20 years. With beautiful mountains plunging into a turquoise sea, it is the best-kept secret in Europe. My family and I usually stayed in Port d’Andratx, where I owned a boat for a while. Many of the coves there are only accessible by boat. I also love Provence for its accessibility. I love being able to go to Marseille on the Eurostar without having to go through the nightmare of an airport. Your most relaxing destination? Anywhere by a lake, such as in upstate New York and Canada. Photo: Alamy Have you ever been on safari? I’ve been to the Maasai Mara in Kenya, about 25 years ago. It was an incredible, extraordinary experience indeed, but I probably won’t do it again. I got malaria while I was there and also went to Lamu (an island just off the coast of Kenya) where I was bitten by this unusual fly. I had to take penicillin that was out of date, as that’s all there was. It seemed to work fine. The most remote place you’ve been? Mount Nemrut in Turkey , where there are these incredible temples and huge statues that are difficult to get to. I was there to shoot a film and you can get amazing views towards Iran and Syria from there. Photo: Alamy Favourite city? Berlin for its vibrancy and youthful nature. I spoke to a local there who said that once the Wall came down, it felt like the city had gone from black and white to colour. I love the sense of bright optimism the city has taken on. Favourite hotel? La Petit Nice in Marseille . It’s a luxurious hotel set in a rather rundown part of the city and every room offers a sea view. Colourful artwork on the former Berlin Wall in Germany Photo: Alamy Worst travel experience? Some time ago I shot a film in Ghana, where we were held at gunpoint by soldiers demanding money from us and firing their guns in the air. But a hundred US dollars can get you out of all sorts of trouble, and that is what it took for them to let us drive past. Going through the US immigration desk at the airport has always been a nightmare. But the US is an incredible country. I love the climate and landscape of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada. The wilderness there has such an evocative feel. Favourite airline? British Airways, which has been very consistent and reliable. My least favourite is Ryanair. I’ve flown with them once and it was a nightmare never to be repeated. I prefer travelling by car if I can or bringing my car on a ferry. Where next? I’d love to visit the remote islands of the South Pacific. ' Spooks: The Greater Good', starring Peter Firth, is released on DVD today.
