Owned by CalTex Hospitality, Inc. and managed by Lodgic Hospitality, the new-build Aloft boasts an ideal location within the America Center Complex. Designed for today’s hyper-connected global traveler, Aloft Santa Clara features 175 loft-like rooms, tech-forward innovation and a lively social atmosphere.\n“Aloft Santa Clara is an exciting new addition to the brand’s growing Silicon Valley portfolio and will offer travelers a uniquely tech-forward hotel experience,” said Brian McGuinness, Senior Vice President, Specialty Select Brands for Starwood. “As Starwood’s hub of technological innovation, Aloft appeals to the early adopter with its forward-thinking approach to hospitality.”\nThe sixth Aloft to open in California, Aloft Santa Clara is ideally located just off Highway 237 within America Center, a brand-new corporate campus in San Jose with more than 900,000 square feet of premium office space, including the global headquarters of Polycom and Flextronics, and 7.5 miles of walking paths with views of the San Francisco Bay. The hotel is located down the street from Yahoo’s global headquarters and within easy reach of the offices of numerous high-tech companies, including Intel, Nortel and National Semiconductors. Less than four miles from Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC), Aloft Santa Clara is also convenient to top area attractions such as Great America Theme Park and Levi’s Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.\nHotel facilities include an outdoor Splash pool, a 24-hour re-charge gym, re:fuel at Aloft – a one-stop gourmet grab & go food and beverage area, 2,800 square feet of flexible meeting space plus an outdoor deck, and the brand’s signature W XYZ bar where guests can enjoy a refreshing cocktail and catch the latest up-and-coming music acts as part of the brand’s signature Live At Aloft Hotels music series.\n“Aloft Santa Clara is a highly anticipated new hotel in this bustling technology hub, and we expect it will quickly emerge as a top choice among visitors to Silicon Valley,” said Umesh Patel, Vice President, CalTex Hospitality, Inc. “The Aloft brand has experienced phenomenal growth, due to its distinctive sense of style, buzzing social scene and line-up of innovative programming.”\nThe Aloft brand’s innovative and exclusive initiatives set it apart from the competition. Aloft Hotels recently announced the launch of SPG Keyless—an evolution of Aloft’s Smart Check-in— the hospitality industry’s first mobile, keyless entry system allowing guests to use their smart phone as a key. The technology is rolling out to all Aloft, Element and W Hotels Worldwide by year’s end. This forward-thinking initiative is part of the brand’s innovative DNA. Additionally, every Aloft Hotel around the world offers live, free access to local emerging artists and some of the hottest bands with Live at Aloft Hotels programming at the W XYZ® bars.\nAloft remains the fastest growing brand in the history of hospitality with nearly 100 hotels in 15 countries. On track to open its milestone 100th hotel later this year, the brand boasts the company’s second largest pipeline. Fueled by accelerating demand in dynamic markets worldwide, Aloft continues to enter new markets including Munich and Stuttgart, Germany as well as expand its portfolio in Greater China to ten hotels by year’s end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T00:06:26.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
