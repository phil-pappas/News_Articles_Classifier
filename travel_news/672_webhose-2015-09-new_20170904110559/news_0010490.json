For more than 8 years, the brand has accepted Mexican Pesos in bill format at all of its carryout pizza locations. \nOn the day of the highly anticipated second GOP debate, September 16 th , the company hopes to cash-in lots of pesos by making its new bean-based FRIJOLERA™ pizza available to every customer for only 50 Mexican Pesos, or around three bucks. The everyday price for this pizza is $8.99 or approximately 150 Mexican Pesos. The current exchange rate at Pizza Patrón stores is 18:1, bills only, with change given in U.S. dollars. \n\"With the economy being such a hot issue in the presidential race, our position is that we would much rather have Mexican Pesos coming into the U.S. than U.S. dollars going to Mexico,\" said Andrew Gamm, executive vice president for Pizza Patrón. \"Our business creates career opportunities for many and helps young people entering the workforce learn valuable skills that they can carry with them throughout their lives. The American dream is alive and well at Pizza Patrón.\" \nCompany officials say that Pizza Patrón currently employs roughly 1,000 people in its 92 locations. Many of the company's managers have tenure approaching 10 years, own a home, and make a living wage that allows them to provide a comfortable life for their families. \n\"Over the years, Pizza Patrón has accepted tens of millions of Mexican Pesos at our stores,\" said Gamm. \"These transactions benefit the U.S. economy, and as anyone can see, it just makes good business sense for our American company. Anyone who has some extra Mexican Pesos lying around can exchange them at any Pizza Patrón for a fresh, made-to-order pizza any day of the week.\" \nThe new FRIJOLERA™ is a large pizza that starts with a black bean sauce and is topped with generous amounts of cheese, smoky chorizo sausage, savory ham and crispy bacon. A large Frijolera pizza runs $8.99 and is available for a limited time only. Prices may vary. Customers may also substitute the premium FRIJOLERA™ black bean sauce on any of their favorite pizzas such as the popular La Mexicana pizza for only $1 more. \nAbout Pizza Patrón Since 1986, Pizza Patrón has been committed to making its promise of \"Más Pizza. Menos Dinero.®\" a reality for every customer. From the beginning, the brand has been recognized for its 'fresh-dough' pizza, its low prices and its trademark \"friendly, bicultural service.\" In 2007, the company drew international media attention with its PIZZA POR PESOS® program when it began accepting Mexican Pesos at all of its restaurants. In 2012, the company's PIZZA POR FAVOR™ promotion that gave free pizzas to anyone who ordered in Spanish sparked international news coverage and lively debate throughout the U.S. Today, Pizza Patrón is the leading Mexican pizza brand in the U.S. and remains dedicated to bringing its unique experience to life with every pizza made, and in every community it serves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T16:37:07.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
