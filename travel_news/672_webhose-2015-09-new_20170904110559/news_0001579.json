New, more efficient hardware combined with a constant flow of applications and digital tools give organisations an ongoing opportunity to improve what they do. Innovations in cloud technologies and mobile communications have levelled the playing field between small businesses, start-ups and their larger counterparts. From a customer point of view, it is sometimes hard to tell the difference between products and services offered by big and small enterprises. By making practical investments in the kind of equipment that can drive businesses forward, SMEs can out-manoeuvre their rivals But not all businesses are taking advantage of this digital transformation and could be limiting their growth as a result. Many have adopted new technologies, but only half-heartedly, and they have failed to keep up with the pace of change. Canon recently spoke with more than 1,000 small and medium-sized business owners (SMEs) across Europe and asked them for their views about IT adoption. Tellingly, the research revealed that a third thought they lacked the skills to deal with technology. Even more worrying, 71pc of respondents admitted they would only purchase new hardware, such as a printer, if they were forced to replace the old model. With this approach such businesses risk missing out on valuable upgrades that bring new productivity-driving features. Business solutions: maximise your productivity with fast technology Photo: Getty The figures were particularly eye-opening set next to the companies’ perceived pressures of being time-poor and burdened with administrative tasks.The figures showed that 28pc of respondents thought they spent too much time on paperwork – a problem that the right technology could address. Says Mark Robinson, market business developer at Canon: “Even in the 21st century, many of Europe’s small businesses continue to be overwhelmed by bureaucracy and paperwork which takes away valuable time they could be spending on growing their businesses and interacting with customers.” Productivity in the economy is one of the UK’s top priorities, yet experts agree that a lack of strong investment in operations, processes and infrastructure is one of the reasons why progress has been slow in recent years despite GDP increasing year on year. Innovations in cloud technologies and mobile communications have levelled the playing field between small businesses and their larger counterparts But companies are slowly waking up to the challenge and realising that by investing in upgrades to legacy systems and keeping up with cutting-edge innovations, they can give their businesses a better chance of success. By making practical investments in the kind of equipment that can drive businesses forward, SMEs can out-manoeuvre their rivals. Producing more means growing more, so businesses that are forward-thinking now stand a better chance of becoming the global corporations of the future.
