Dorset conceals many within its bucolic folds. \nLong since abandoned as thoroughfares, and overgrown with brambles and bushes, they are often unknown to all but the very local. When I asked the tourist office in the market town of Bridport how to find one, no one there knew what I was talking about. They’re watching you ... Source: AP \nBut I kept looking and asking. Finally, one recent sunny Saturday afternoon, after getting directions from a bearded countryman who pointed up a lane with a stick, my family and I strode northwest out of the village of Symondsbury. \nFor some way our path was just an ordinary country lane but then the greenery thickened, the path twisted and everything changed. \nParallel walls of soft brown rock suddenly climbed above us forming a narrow gorge 6 meters high in places. It was if a giant finger had gouged the earth then left it to settle back as it may. \nTrees clung to the sides at astonishing angles as if frozen in the act of falling, their roots exposed like giant snakes, their branches intertwined high above to form a roof that filtered the sunlight. A sunken path, overgrown with greenery, between the villages of Symondsbury and North Chideock. Source: AP \nWe stood stupefied in a green underworld. It was like being in a mythical landscape, utterly detached from reality. It was awe-inspiring and incredibly serene. I was sure the spell would break but nothing moved and no one else came. The only sounds were birdsong and the occasional whoop of delight from my 6-year-old son. \nBut there was also an ambivalence. As we explored we noticed faces and giant eyes expertly carved into the rock. For all its tranquillity in daylight it is probably an unnerving walk at dusk or later. It was then I remembered the name my guide had used for the path: Hell Lane. I kept that information to myself. They are abandoned thoroughfares.

All that’s there is a line of greenery like any other, among a patchwork of fields; an astonishing slice of England hiding in plain sight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:33:28.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
