Melting permafrost caused by rising global temperatures has made the once impenetrable Arctic Circle increasingly accessible, sparking intense competition between Russia, the United States and China to assert control over an area that it is thought may hold as much as 40 per cent of the world’s oil and gas resources.

The American Coast Guard fleet is antiquated, and has only two fully functional icebreakers, while Russia is said to have 40 of the vessels, with another 11 planned or under construction. China is also a player in the area with one icebreaker and plans to build more. Russia has been rapidly expanding its influence in the Arctic, earmarking £2.8 billion for Arctic development over the next five years in an ambitious military and industrial development that is being personally overseen by Vladimir Putin, the country’s president. Last March Mr Putin ordered a full combat military exercise in the area, involving 40,000 Russian troops and dozens of warships and submarines. The development highlights the stark challenges of reconciling climate policies with immediate economic necessity. Mr Obama’s visit to Alaska is also part of what he hopes will be a legacy-defining mission to cut American greenhouse emissions by almost a third. Images of melting permafrost and rising sea levels that are now forcing thousands of people to abandon their coastal homes are intended to drive home the urgency of Mr Obama’s ambitious policies to tackle global warming. During the three-day trip the president has used a mix of traditional politicking and celebrity television to get his message across. On Tuesday, the president spent the day with Bear Grylls , filming an episode of the British survival expert's programme “Running Wild” in which the pair hiked the melting Exit Glacier.

Mr Obama was due to fly to Kotzebue yesterday, the main Arctic town in an area that is battling coastal erosion caused by rising sea levels. Residents in as many as a dozen of the surrounding villages have now voted to relocate their homes inland to more stable terrain, a move that may end their traditional way of life, but which many say is now inevitable. “In Arctic Alaska, villages are being damaged by powerful storm surges, which, once held at bay by sea ice, are battering the barrier islands where those villages sit,” the White House said, as it announced a set of local programmes designed to alleviate the pressure on the communities there.

Shell is being allowed to drill for oil in one of the most remote and dangerous places in the world, with none of the equipment ever having been tested,” said Michael LeVine, Pacific senior counsel for Oceana , an environmental group. Mr LeVine said an enhanced fleet of icebreakers was a necessary part of creating an infrastructure to manage the environmental fallout of “inevitable” industrialisation of this once pristine area, but said that the current unregulated race for resources in the Arctic was a “recipe for disaster”. @telegraphnews", "external_links": ["https://t.co/5y0EZH9RKi", "http://t.co/eAVC9RjeMV"], "published": "2015-09-03T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T04:49:26.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
