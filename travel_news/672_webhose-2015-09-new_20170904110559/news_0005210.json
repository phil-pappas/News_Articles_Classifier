Keshia Handa (far right) loved to dance, according to friends. Source: Facebook \nShe had been holidaying in Turkey for two weeks and only days ago had checked into the Grand London Hotel, in Istanbul’s Beyoglu region, with friends to attend the dance party, which attracted more than 200 people. \nThe dancing enthusiast often travelled the world to attend dance parties, friends told Hurriyet Daily News . \nMs Handa’s former classmate, psychologist Mel Stephenson, told New Zealand’s NZME news agency her friend was “very popular” and a “genuinely beautiful person”. \n“She was just a delightful person — really warm and genuine and just very caring,” she said. \n“I just think sometimes bad things happen to good people.” \nThe hotel’s owner Ibrahim Huzmeli told BGN News the event was an accident and staff were deeply saddened by the tragedy. \nMs Handa’s family and New Zealand embassy officials arranged for her body to be returned to New Zealand. \nTurkish authorities are investigating the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T05:29:01.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
