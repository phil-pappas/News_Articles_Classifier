Integrating rail with other transport modes around the station hubs will give easy access to housing, work, tourist attractions and further education establishments including Edinburgh College, and Newbattle Abbey College.\"The opening of the Borders Railway is keenly anticipated in Midlothian. The new line will bring great opportunities for the residents and communities of Midlothian and visitors alike.\"Scottish Borders Council Leader, Councillor David Parker, said: \"It is hoped one million passengers a year will be using the railway within five years of it opening.
