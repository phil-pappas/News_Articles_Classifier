Out there is Millbrook proving ground, loaded with the most difficult and challenging corners you could possibly meet. So I’d buckle up and hang on, because this could be hairy,” he says in the stunning video above. He’s not wrong. In this incredible new video experience, you are right there alongside him as he tackles every bend and switchback. How? For the first time ever, your viewpoint is not fixed. You can look through the windscreen at the corners fast approaching, look through the window at the scenery flashing past, watch Collins’ hands on the wheel and his feet on the pedals, even look behind you at the receding white lines. The end result is impressive. Viewing it on a phone is something else. As you move it around, your view changes British technology company Rewind rigged a constellation of cameras in the driving seat of Collins’ 300-horsepower BMW to film in every direction as he completed his hair-raising circuit of Millbrook. Cutting-edge technology stitches all of this footage together into an immersive whole. The end result is impressive on a laptop. Viewing it on a phone is something else, and shows the true potential of virtual reality: your phone becomes a window onto the virtual world. As you move it around, your view changes. Now imagine wearing a headset that places the phone in front of your eyes, showing a 3D image for a genuinely immersive experience. Those headsets are already on sale and are likely to revolutionise the gaming industry from 2016 onwards. Everyone who tries them walks away amazed. Perhaps one day driving with the Stig will be a virtual reality game? If so, start training now. To match his two-minute lap time you will have to tackle: 1 The first uphill S bend. “It’s a very misleading corner because it suddenly tightens up in the middle and then you have to throw it back in the other direction,” says Collins in the film. 2 A tight hairpin into a steep downhill S bend. “You can carry a lot of speed through this.” 3 An off-camber left and right. “It’s very easy to get these wrong.” 4 A power-slide around a U-bend. “I went a bit wide there.” 5 A sharp dip that compresses the spine before a right-hand turn on a blind crest. “On the next crest, the back wheels go very light.” 6 And finally, “the jump”: Collins’ BMW goes airborne for a second before a left turn, a right turn on another blind crest and the home stretch. Collins is left out of breath and buzzing with adrenaline. You will be too. • Win £150 in Shell V-Power Nitro+ fuel vouchers Do you want to help look after your engine?
