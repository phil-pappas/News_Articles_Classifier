While most Travelocity customers travel for vacation or business, an increasing number of people are traveling to make a difference outside of their communities. To celebrate and encourage this trend known as \"voluntourism,\" Travelocity is announcing that as part of its Travel for Good program, three deserving individuals will receive travel awards to enable their dreams of philanthropic travel. Along with the travel awards, Travelocity will be making a $10,000 donation directly to each of the non-profit organizations identified by the award recipients.\nVoluntourism has become one of the fastest growing areas of travel in the past decade with millions of volunteers a year estimated to be pursuing purpose-driven travel. In a recent study by Wakefield Research for Travelocity, 63% of Americans are interested in taking a trip that combines an opportunity to volunteer and leisure time. When asked what would prevent people from taking a \"voluntourism\" trip, 42% said cost is a top reason. This is one of the driving forces behind the relaunch of Travelocity's Travel for Good program.\n\"Part of our mission at Travelocity is to inspire people to travel, but what is so exciting about our Travel for Good program is that we get the opportunity to recognize those people who inspire us,\" said Brad Wilson , vice president and general manager of Travelocity. \"Everyone at Travelocity is eager to learn about the amazing journeys that these people wish to take in order to make a difference around the world. The hardest part is going to be choosing just three.\"\nPrior to the official launch of the program, Travelocity invited employees to participate in the Travel for Good campaign. Not surprising, several employees jumped at the chance and many are still away on their voluntour efforts. Along with employee efforts to benefit organizations across the United States , some employees are heading as far as Nicaragua and India to work with local non-profit agencies there.\nApplying for a travel award is easy. The Travel for Good program is accepting submissions via Twitter through Sun., Oct. 18 at 11:59 p.m. ET . To apply, interested individuals must follow @Travelocity or @TravelForGood on Twitter and using the hashtag #TravelForGood, share the location and purpose of their trip, the organization with whom they want to volunteer and why they are passionate about that cause. Applications can be submitted in any shareable format, including text, images and video, to best demonstrate the goals of their trip and volunteer efforts.\nFor more information and full program details, visit the Travel for Good page at www.travelocity.com/travelforgood . Entries can also be submitted directly from this page. Along with the three travel awards, Travelocity will also be awarding $500 to 100 individuals to get them started on saving for their own Travel for Good efforts. All of the travel award recipients will be notified throughout the duration of the campaign.\nAbout Travelocity\nTravelocity wants to inspire you to \"Go & Smell the Roses!®\" and is dedicated to being your kindred spirit – a travel companion and a travel instigator, roaming the world beside you while helping make your traveling experience memorable with innovative apps, competitive prices and 24/7 customer service.

CST# 2056372-50\nSurvey Methodology\nThe Travelocity Travel for Good Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research ( www.wakefieldresearch.com ) among 1,008 nationally representative U.S. adults ages 18+, between September 14th and September 18th, 2015 , using an email invitation and an online survey. Quotas have been set to ensure reliable and accurate representation of the U.S. adult population ages 18+. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 3.1 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.\nContact:\nJina Michael\nCitizen Relations\n310.698.9009\njina.michael@citizenrelations.com\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150918/268165LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/travelocity-relaunches-travel-for-good-grant-program-for-voluntourist-hopefuls-300145803.html\n©2015 PR Newswire.
