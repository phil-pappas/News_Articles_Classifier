Half a million illegal border crossings have been detected in the same period, almost double the number reported for the whole of 2014.\nWhile the immediate priority is handling refugees from war zones, rich countries must adapt migration policy to a broader trend where one in 10 migrants to OECD countries is from China and almost one in 20 from India, the OECD said.\nThat includes migrants such as expatriated workers, students and au pairs on temporary stays and other economic migrants who are often given work and residence permits under policies that governments use to attract foreigners with specific skills.\nImmigrants used to raise the total population of Europe by 100,000 or so per year until the mid-1980s but that has risen to around a million a year now, the OECD said, noting that this was in part due to declining birth rates in many European countries.\n\"Migration has been the biggest engine of demographic growth in the EU as a whole since the mid-1990s,\" its report said. \"It is about to become the only one.\"\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T18:11:36.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
