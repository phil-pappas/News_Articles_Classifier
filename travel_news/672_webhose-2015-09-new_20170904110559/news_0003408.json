Exodus Travel said it is infuriated that, while Nepal is a country desperate for business and they have what they describe as an “all clear on trekking routes”, a warning that includes Everest base camp has not been lifted. “If they wait any longer to lift their travel warning it will be too late for this season which will have dreadful consequences in the country,” said Pete Burrell, the company’s managing director. “The sooner they lift this effective ‘ban’, the sooner Nepal can recover properly. By continuing with this the FO is kicking a country that is already on the canvas.” • Everest: the first men on top of the world Trekkers on a trail leading to Everest Base Camp in Nepal earlier this year Photo: Getty “The Foreign Office needs to scrutinise its advice again,” agreed our writer Michelle Jana Chan, who has recently returned from Everest. She said most tour operators are running trips to Everest base camp, with 26 treks operating while she was there. “Nepal will get back on its feet through tourism but it will be a struggle if travellers are going to be prevented from getting insurance due to Foreign Office advice.” • Sixty fascinating Everest facts Paul Hart, our gear expert, agreed. “I personally would return to Nepal, but the main thing is to be aware of your trekking route and the possibility of dangers, and then take advice and guidance from those with local knowledge,” he said. “Ultimately it is about taking responsibility for your own safety and choices to go on any particular route. I travelled extensively in Nepal and landslides were always something that posed a risk. In that sense little has changed although clearly infrastructure repair is still ongoing.” The Foreign Office’s advice, which addresses concerns relating to the monsoon season that is just about to end, is based on regular consultations with scientists. A spokesman said its advice remains the same. “We continue to advise against all but essential travel to many mountain areas because of increased landslide risks during monsoon season following the recent earthquake,” he said. “We constantly monitor the situation on the ground in Nepal,” he added, “taking into account expert scientific advice, and will continue to keep our travel advice under close review.” • Everest by hot air balloon Trekkers climbing Island Peak in the Everest region Photo: Fotolia/AP Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel Telegraph Travel Collection»", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T20:44:53.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
