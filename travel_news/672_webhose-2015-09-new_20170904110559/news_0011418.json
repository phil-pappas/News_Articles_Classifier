She has been imprisoned since December 2014. \n\"Ismayilova has been sentenced to jail for one reason: because she wrote critical stories about official corruption,\" said John Hughes, the National Press Club's president. \"There's only one solution to this problem: let her go.\" \nIsmayilova is a recipient of the National Press Club's John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award for 2015. \nAt least seven other journalists are said to be imprisoned in Azerbaijan on similarly trumped up charges, according to reporters' advocacy groups. \nThe National Press Club, based in Washington, D.C., is the world's leading professional organization for journalists. Through its Press Freedom Committee, the club speaks out for journalists rights and in favor of transparency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T04:39:36.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
