I know it takes time and effort to introduce new habits, so I hope you’ve been able to put some of these tips to good use.\nBut the cost can be overwhelming, and you obviously don’t want to scour every sale rack at NorthPark Center to find that one good deal on a DVF dress. So how can you score fabulous investment pieces, quality staple items and fun statement accessories without breaking the bank?\nCome shop our Closet Conversion Fall 2015, a seasonal event hosted by Naomi Belle Consignments offering designer and luxury fashion for men and women at prices up to 90 percent off retail. Available items include designers and labels such as Jimmy Choo, Burberry, Diane von Furstenberg, Prada, Gucci, Tory Burch, Marc Jacobs, J Crew, Anthropologie, Kate Spade, Lululemon, Ann Taylor, Rag and Bone, Eileen Fisher and more.\nAll our volunteers and consignors are invited to an exclusive presale Sept. 16 before it opens to the public. We still have a few spots left if you register at naomibelle.com.\nThe sale is at Lovers Lane United Methodist Church, 9200 Inwood Rd. in Dallas, in Asbury Hall at the northeast corner of the campus. It takes place Sept. 17 and 18 from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sept. 19 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.\nDiane von Furstenberg dress\nAren’t we always looking for a way to spice up our LBD? It’s a simple, classic look but can often feel boring or tired. But it doesn’t have to. This Diane von Furstenberg dress is the perfect blend of edge and sophistication. Everything from the neckline to the fit and length revolutionizes the standard sheath dress without sacrificing style. The retail price is $398, but this gorgeous dress will be only $40. With a price tag like that, you can be sexy, sophisticated, stylish and still perfectly sensible.\nPrada shoulder bag\nHave you ever thought about what item in your closet gets the most use? It’s your handbag. It gets tossed on the floorboard of your car, hung on door handles, emptied by your sweet children and stuffed in overhead compartments. Your purse really takes a beating when you live an active lifestyle, which is why I think that your handbag should be one of your few key investment pieces. So if you’ve been looking for a gorgeous handbag that will last for years, stand up to daily abuse and carry all your precious cargo, look no further than this ruffled Prada shoulder bag. The original price tag was almost $2,000, but you can purchase this like-new bag for only $750.\nCitizens of Humanity jeans\nDenim is the American uniform. We all wear it, we all love it and we all need a few good pairs. These Citizen of Humanity Rocket High-Rise Skinnies retail between $178 and $228 depending on the color and wash, but we will have over a dozen of these (and others) in like-new condition for only $30 each.\nFur coat\nRemember those days when glamour ruled, men wore top hats and women wore furs? Would you like to go back to that? I would love to! Or you can bring those glamorous days back this winter with this beautiful and timeless fur coat. Genuine furs like this will last for decades upon decades and can cost thousands upon thousands of dollars. Furs are truly the most practical form of extravagance, and those who own them will tell you they are worth every penny. However if you’re not ready to splurge your child’s college savings on your fashion fantasy, then this long, vintage fur is the perfect match for you at only $400.\nHolding Horses shirt\nDo you just need some casual everyday wear? Something to just throw on this Saturday while running errands or heading out to your son’s soccer game? Popover and oxford shirts like this one are probably my personal favorite because of the tailored fit but casual, comfortable feel. The average price tag for this and similar shirts at Anthropologie is $88, but you can stock up on these basics at Closet Conversion Fall 2015 for only $12 to $18 apiece (this particular top is only $16). Five shirts for the price of one sounds like guilt-free shopping to me.\nManolo Blahnik pumps\nNude pumps are just another one of those all-season wardrobe must-haves. Whether you are in the corporate world or a stay-at-home mom, you need a quality pair to wear with slacks, dresses, suits, skirts and even to dress up your skinnies or boyfriend jeans. With that much wear, your heels need a quality and comfort level to match along with a stand-out style that says your nude pumps are anything but a boring neutral. These brand-new Manolo Blahnik BB Polished Cork Pumps are priced at $695, and for good reason. But you can walk away with these for over 65 percent off retail at only $225.\nDV Dolce Vita Wedge booties\nBoots and booties are just a staple for the fall and winter seasons. But constantly changing trends can be tough on the budget, which in turn can be tough on your style. Personally, I love the recent trend of hidden wedge boots because you feel comfortable and casual but they add just a little extra style to any outfit. If you’ve been looking for a fun pair, then I absolute recommend these DV Dolce Vita boots, originally $89, priced at only $28!\nCheck out our blog for sneak peeks of more fabulous items available this week and to find out why we practice “consignment with a conscience.”\nJoelle Allen is a Briefing columnist, mother of four and co-owner of Naomi Belle Consignments in Dallas.
