Some tourists touched the turtles, others stood on top of the nests, and parents placed their children on top of the turtles to take photographs, the group reported.\nOstional receives massive turtle arrivals, known as arribadas , almost every month. But September and October are the peak months of the season, and tourism companies increase tours to watch the turtles’ arrival and nesting.\nThis particular arribada occurred during a weekend, increasing the number of visitors, SITRAMINAE members said.\nThe lack of rainfall affecting the northern region also helped attract more visitors. September and October usually register the most rainfall of the year, and rains at Ostional can cause large river swells that prevent visitors from reaching the beach.\nThe refuge is guarded by only two park rangers, and last weekend they received help from only three National Police officers, who were unable to control the situation.\nHernández said that although visitors may only enter the beach with a licensed tour guide, many entered the refuge via unauthorized access points from nearby locations. He said that in coming days officials will meet with National Police officers, local tour guide associations and community leaders to better implement control.\nHundreds of tourists stand in front of olive ridley sea turtles at Costa Rica’s Ostional Beach, preventing them from nesting.\n(Via SITRAMINAE)\nCommunity benefit\nOstional is among the top four most important sites in the world for nesting of olive ridley sea turtles ( Lepidochelys olivacea ). Hundreds of thousands arrive each year along this 7-kilometer stretch of beach.\nThe number of turtles during September and October and the amount of eggs they lay at each arribada is so high that when new groups of turtles arrive, they often end up destroying the eggs from earlier nesting.\nResidents of this small community are the only people legally allowed to harvest turtle eggs for consumption and sale. They can take only eggs deposited within the first 72 hours of the arribadas.\nTurtle nesting observation tours are regulated by national law at Ostional and other popular destinations, both on Pacific and Caribbean beaches.\nRegulations state that tourists may only enter the beach with a licensed guide in small groups, carrying only special flashlights and following guide instructions at all times to avoid disturbing the turtles.\nContact L.
