Hampton Manor , a rather glum 19th-century Tudor Gothic country house that was just asking to become a care home, which it was before its transformation into an upscale hotel, but where much of the trendy noughties decoration is already somewhat passé and where the roar of planes taking off and landing at Birmingham International just over two miles away cannot be ignored. I loved it, against all expectations. This place has soul, not to mention fantastic food and brilliant service. For the owners and staff, it’s a labour of love, and it’s their energy, drive, attention to detail and desire to get things right that make it such an exciting and surprising place to stay. It restores my faith in the ability of a new generation of independent hoteliers to succeed in a world of groups and brands and millionaire owners where money is no object. The moment we walked in, slightly wincing at the clichéd purple-and-lime tones inside, we were buoyed by the welcome. James Hill (the owner, along with his parents – his dad is often to be seen on a tractor tending the 45 acres of grounds) is young and his staff are younger still. The boys are dressed casually in chinos and tweed waistcoats and strike just the right note: casual but professional. Motivated and marvellous Craig, just 25 and already general manager, should go into schools and tell students why there is a future for them in hospitality. In a separate part of the manor house a successful wedding and events operation is run. The hotel part consists of 15 bedrooms, a bar, huge and elegant Parlour (recently redecorated with a feminine touch by James’s wife, Fjona) and Peel’s restaurant. There’s also a lovely terrace, the wooded grounds and a massive original walled garden, currently occupied by local residents’ allotments that gives a lovely sense of the hotel being part of its community. The Butler's Lodge at Hampton Manor Photo: Fjona Hill James and his team are really thinking about what guests want these days (but please stop saying “journey” and “vision” – it sets my teeth on edge). It’s the little touches that count: those uniforms; firepits on the terrace at night; a Lalani Tea bar in the Parlour; endless gins and inventive cocktails; a refreshing wine list curated by a talented 23-year-old sommelier; funny waiters; spirited room information; spa treatments; creative afternoon teas (overseen by Craig’s mum, who started in the hotel as a pot washer). And Hampton Manor has a USP: every successful hip hotel has to have one. The restaurant (and separate chef’s table) is sensational. The most beautiful hand-painted Fromental wallpaper complements the room’s original panelling and the lighting sets off its smoky browns, smudgy greens and splashes of bright pink to perfection. Most importantly, the playful cooking of Rob Palmer does more than justice to the surroundings. Our evening was a thrill. The reception area and extremely comfortable bedrooms (and superb bathrooms) need de-purple-and-lime-ing, becoming cooler and more restrained. And the website, in my view, is messy. Otherwise, an uplifting, exciting, hugely welcome hit. Doubles from £150 per night, including breakfast. Access possible for guests using wheelchairs.
