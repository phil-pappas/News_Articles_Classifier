With visibility into this data, marine terminals can plan more efficiently and reduce congestion at the gate.\n\"Truck visits to marine terminals can take over two hours due to any number of delays,\" said Eric Klein , CEO and Co-Founder of Crux Systems. \"We reduce turn times by enabling better visibility and communication between terminals, dispatchers and drivers. By introducing more efficient gate processing with automated gate tickets, marine terminals can improve turnaround times even more.\"\nHow it works\nDrivers or dispatchers simply forward their delivery orders to orders@cruxsystems.com , and the information is automatically imported to their account. They then gain visibility into container availability, routes, truck locations, and pickup and drop off times. Notifications about container availability are automatically updated, so potential problems with delivery orders can be addressed before drivers arrive at the terminal gate.\n\"The notifications are all provided automatically, so drivers and dispatchers no longer have to go to dozens of different websites to seek out this information,\" said Klein.\nKey features include:\nContainer availability status: notifications are automatically updated in the app, or can easily be integrated into existing systems with the Crux Systems API. Automated gate tickets: allows marine terminals to automatically provide drivers with gate ticket information as soon as the terminal operating system processes a gate stage. Advance arrival notifications: terminals can know in advance when trucks will be arriving so they can do better yard planning to reduce unnecessary moves and costs. \"Crux Systems eliminates a lot of wasted time that drivers, dispatchers and terminals spend seeking out the information they need to complete their jobs,\" said Klein. \"By saving a driver just 60 minutes a day through more efficient planning and communication, that's a potential increase of 10% additional time available for driving. Drivers are able get on their way to their final destination more quickly, and ultimately, save them time that can be spent completing another delivery.\"\nThe driver app is available as a free download from the App Store. Plans for dispatchers start at $35 /month for container availability notifications, visibility into driver routes and locations, automatic recording of pickups and drop offs, and access to delivery order and driver histories.
