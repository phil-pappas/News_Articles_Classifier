Here are 10 reasons why you just have to visit. 1. Famous attractions Titanic Belfast pays homage to Belfast’s most famous daughter, and in just three years it’s become Northern Ireland’s most popular visitor attraction. As state-of-the-art as Titanic herself when she was built in the shipyard next-door, it’s part multimedia extravaganza, part soul-searing human saga, and all on a titanic scale. It’s the next best thing to being aboard. If you’re feeling really indulgent, enjoy an afternoon tea served alongside the exact replica of the ship’s Grand Staircase to truly feel like a passenger. 2. Coastal beauty The Causeway Coastal Route between Belfast and Derry-Londonderry could be the drive of your life. Its 130 winding miles take in the glorious Glens of Antrim, rugged Rathlin Island (you can get a ferry to this island from Ballycastle), the ancient castles of Carrickfergus and Glenarm - the stunning ruins of Dunluce Castle - six-mile Downhill Beach and the peerless Giant’s Causeway. Don’t miss hair-raising Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge, a cliff-to-cliff walkway swaying 100ft above the surf where fulmars and kittiwakes wheel. 3. Thrilling landscapes The Giant’s Causeway was made to be admired – but made by whom? An aeons-old volcanic eruption that threw up this colossal stack of perfect basalt hexagons? Or Irish legend Finn McCool as a launch pad for his one-giant invasion of Scotland? Either way this Unesco World Heritage Site is one of the world’s most thrilling landscapes with some of Ireland’s most dramatic coastal walks. 4. Vibrant cities Derry~Londonderry has some of the most complete city walls in Europe, enclosing approximately 1,500 years of history, from siege-busting cannon to the fantasy-gothic Guildhall. This amazing city has so much to offer visitors, with street artists, hip cafés, music festivals and the slinky 4-year-old Peace Bridge spanning the lazy River Foyle. Visit at the end of October and enjoy the city’s Banks of the Foyle Halloween Carnival, a colourful festival with live music and entertainment, a great family atmosphere and plenty of spooky happenings. 5. Water-based fun County Fermanagh is a watery wonderland. Paddle a canoe or hail a waterbus on placid lakes and snaking rivers to visit mysterious islands and deserted creeks. Or hop on a bike for a leisurely peddle towards misty mountains. Admire the Palladian grandeur and gardens of Florence Court, then glide along an underground river in the Unesco-recognised Marble Arch Caves. Bliss. Drive of your life: the stunning ruins of Dunluce Castle 6. Lush green fairways Great golf courses abound in Northern Ireland, whether you prefer to meander between lush pastures or play a links course pounded by Atlantic surf. Pit your wits against the world-famous Royal Portrush course, play a relaxing round by the lakeside at Lough Erne, or try the Holywood and Dungannon swards where Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke cut their teeth. 7. Saintly experiences Saint Patrick’s footsteps are still visible in Northern Ireland and they will take you to some of the area’s most spectacular sites. Visit simple Saul Church, commemorating the first one built by Saint Patrick which was a simple barn, and magnificent Down Cathedral where a plain stone marks the saint’s grave. Climb lonely Slemish Mountain where he once tended sheep. Or walk the St Patrick’s Way: The Pilgrim Walk through the beautiful Mountains of Mourne. 8. Beautiful gardens Glorious gardens love Northern Ireland’s mild climate. Mount Stewart, overlooking Strangford Lough, is simply magnificent, with a series of outdoor rooms and vibrant parterres. Rowallane Garden in Saintfield is a true plantsman’s garden. The follies and water features of Castle Ward are like a tour through horticultural history, while fragrant Springhill House in Ballindrum recreates an Elizabethan camomile lawn. If Castle Ward looks familiar, that’s because its farmyard is the set for Winterfell in the HCO blockbuster series Game of Thrones - just one of many sites in Northern Ireland that can be linked together as a whole Game of Thrones location tour. 9. Retail therapy When the sun’s not shining, the savvy go shopping. St George’s Market in Belfast has been voted the UK’s top indoor market by the National Association of British Market Authorities, with fruit and flowers, local arts and crafts and live music on Sundays. The city’s Victoria Square Shopping Centre boasts top brand names and fabulous views from the Dome. Or head east to pretty Greyabbey, famed for its antique shops. 10. Dramatic cliffs Walking the cliff path at The Gobbins, in County Antrim, is a truly special experience. Feel the sea spray on your face as you edge along the narrow winding path cut into the cliff on a guided tour. Follow a series of white-knuckle bridges tunnels and steps for a unique view of the very edge of Northern Ireland. A stroll along The Gobbins cliffs was first enjoyed by the Edwardians in 1902, but the experience has just reopened for the first time in half a century following a multi-million pound makeover and is already a sell-out success. It makes a great addition to the Causeway Coastal Route and is a fantastic way to round off a tour of Northern Ireland’s many charms. • Come and find your holiday inspiration at ireland.com Jump into Northern Ireland Savour every second in Ireland, where the natural beauty, the culture and the people all seem to exist together in a timeless moment.
