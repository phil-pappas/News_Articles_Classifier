Transaero – Russia’s No. 2 carrier – reported debts of nearly $1 billion as of\nJune 30, according to the airline’s earnings update for the first half of 2015.\nTransaero has been hammered by a devalued ruble and a drop demand for travel\nfrom within Russia. The once fast-growing carrier has slowed growth plans. Just last\nweek, Airbus “postponed the delivery of its A380 superjumbo to Transaero Airlines in\norder to help the No. 2 Russian carrier cope with slowing travel demand in its home\nmarket.” Transaero had previously revealed plans to fly its A380s with more seats than any carrier currently flying the world’s biggest passenger jet.\nAs for the acquisition by Aeroflot, Russia’s RIA news agency says Aeroflot will pay a\nsymbolic 1 ruble for a controlling stake in Transaero.\nTransaero says in a statement that it would be acquired by Aeroflot “in the interests of\nthe development of the commercial aviation.” Aeroflot is Russia’s top carrier, with Transaero saying the combination would “create one of the largest in the world group of airlines.”\nAeroflot currently controls about 37% of the Russian market while Transaero has\nabout 14%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:22:12.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
