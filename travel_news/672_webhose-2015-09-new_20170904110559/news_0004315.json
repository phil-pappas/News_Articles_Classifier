The injured party initially tried to sue the adult supervising the child, but this case was dismissed. So now go after the child? Really? In Austria children can be culpable if they understand the consequences of what they’ve done. The actions in this particular case involve the child allegedly making a sudden turn into the path of the woman. Well, that does rather suggest that the victim was behind the child when this happened. As the FIS Rules of Conduct highlight, “A skier or snowboarder coming from behind must choose his or her route in such a way not to endanger skiers or snowboarders ahead.” Then again, maybe they were skiing side by side when the accident occurred. No matter, the fact remains that we are talking about a six year old here. What the FIS Rules of Conduct don’t highlight is that young children by their very nature are irrational, impetuous and utterly unpredictable – I say this from ingrained knowledge as a father of two young daughters. However wide a berth you give adults on the slopes, you should times it by 10 when it comes to kids. It is the adult’s responsibility to take on board this unpredictability – the child’s behaviour shouldn't be blamed. I don’t wish to make excuses for children, it’s just the way it is. • Schoolboy falls 1,640ft in ski resort while taking a selfie If the child had been acting in a grossly irresponsible way, then the correct person to blame is the supervisor, and this has already been dismissed out of court. The accident took place on the slopes of Hochhäderich mountain in the Bregenzerwald forest Unfortunately, what I think this highlights is our increasingly litigious society, and that someone is always to blame for whatever misfortune should befall us. I don’t wish to deny that there are many serious hit and run incidents on the slopes and it’s appropriate that those should potentially end up in court. And resorts should certainly do more to educate skiers and snowboarders on how to behave on the slopes – but that’s a whole other issue. • Are these the most dangerous ski goggles ever? In this particular case we are talking about a youngster and it seems that this is one of those unfortunate accidents where no one is at fault. Full stop. Should the case against the child be won, I fear the floodgates will open to litigation on the mountains. The slopes so many of us visit for freedom and respite from our every day lives will become a legal battle ground where only lawyers – certainly not skiers – benefit.
