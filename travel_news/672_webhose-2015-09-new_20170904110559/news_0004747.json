Overall, the implementation of ProFLOW brought about a 20% reduction in cycle-time. The need to scrap molded products due to short shots or belling was also entirely eliminated, due to ProFLOW 1000's ability to reduce peak mold pressure when used as an additive on polypropylene during the injection processes.\nFurthermore, the customer achieved a reduction of 13 seconds off the previous cycle-time, from 68 to 55 seconds per part. This time savings will result in an hourly production rate of 65 parts, which multiplies out to 87,400 parts produced annually for this customer, all precisely meeting their thermoplastic molding specifications.\nBy using ProFLOW on one product for one customer, PolyVisions has lifted this customer's total ROI to $72,500 per year, owing to a savings of $174,700 per year in reduced or eliminated scrap and $167,860 per year in reduced machining costs.\n\"We are proud that a resin additive like ProFLOW 1000 which was created, developed and produced by PolyVisions is able to make such a tangible impact on bottom-line results for our customers,\" said Scott B. Howard , CEO of PolyVisions Inc. \"ProFLOW holds some very useful applications for improving our customers' plastic molding products and achieving significant cost-savings, and this case is an example of that usefulness.\"\nMore information about ProFLOW 1000 is available at http://www.polyvisions.com/plastic-resins-pellets/proflow-plastic-suppliers .
