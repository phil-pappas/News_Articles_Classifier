Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 02, 2015 eTN   \nZimbabwe’s authorities were swift to grant permission for a rescue mission of a lost 2-year-old elephant calf, which was spotted by a local resident and raised immediately the interest of conservation groups. \nA team of wildlife vets yesterday managed to locate the young elephant which appeared poorly fed if not outright starved, darted it, and loaded the animal on a plane to Harare’s elephant nursery, where it will be cared for, hoping to ensure its survival. Had the young calf remained in the wild it would have no doubt fallen prey to lions or other predators within days. \nVanessa Bristow, who triggered the response when she first saw the young calf wandering lost in the wild, confirmed the airlift on her Facebook page after her initial comments raised concern among Zimbabwe’s conservation fraternity when she wrote: “… her spine quite pronounced along the top of her back.” \n“Plane loaded with Sizi elephant calf and about to get airborne. Prayers now people,” said Zimbabwe’s Aware Trust, which is run by local veterinarians, in their Facebook update yesterday evening. \nThe name Sizi refers to the natural spring where the calf was first seen alone by Vanessa. \nEarlier on, Aware had warned that the rescue mission to save the elephant came with significant risks and launched an appeal for donations. \n“The elephant will have to be anesthetized for three hours during capture and flight, and she is already compromised. We believe, however, it is her best chance of survival,” Aware added to their Facebook post. \nThe darting and flight appears to have gone smoothly. \nAware also said that after more than two weeks alone, the chances of the elephant’s herd coming back to it had now all but disappeared. \nThe elephant nursery in Harare already cares for at least four young elephants and the arrival of two more will swell the numbers but also vastly increase the need for funds. \nThe nursery said on Tuesday it was also preparing to airlift an elephant calf found injured and alone near Lake Kariba in northern Zimbabwe. \nThat additional rescue is due to take place this Wednesday morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T06:42:14.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
