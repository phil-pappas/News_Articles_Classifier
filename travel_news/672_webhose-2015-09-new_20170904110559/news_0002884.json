Fans of the Malaysian MotoGP would be thrilled to know that the annual race is back for the 25th year while golfers would be excited to see the return of CIMB Classic – PGA Tour. The general public can participate in the BSN Putrajaya Night Marathon and enjoy the beauty of the federal administrative capital at night.\nOctober is also the month for foodies as the Malaysia International Gourmet Festival returns for the 12th year. Besides that, this is also the month for arts and culture enthusiasts. Among the not to be missed events include the unique International Aborigines Art Festival, Citrawarna@Kuala Lumpur, and Putrajaya International Islamic Arts & Culture Festival.\nBefore I conclude, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce to you The Haven, a luxury resort located in Bandar Baru Medan Ipoh. It is the first and only 5-star luxury resort in Ipoh, Perak.\nTill then, I hope you’ll enjoy all the exciting events for this month!\nAzizah Aziz\nDirector of Corporate Communication, Tourism Malaysia\nSource:- Tourism Malaysia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:08:03.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
