For one it has stripped its flagship Galaxy S phones of removeable batteries and microSD cards. People reacted with anger, but I can see some of the logic in the company's decision there.Then there was the Note 5, which won't be coming to the UK at all, and that had also removed the user-access to battery and the ability to add extra storage. This was a worse move, because the Note is an enthusiast product, and the need to have those features is somewhat more important on that phone.So at this point I've decided that I don't need to understand Samsung's strategy, just go with it and review the devices as they stand. Samsung's strategy A recent conversation with a Samsung senior exec has somewhat cleared up the company's attitude to phones. The firm says that consumers really want the option of big screens, but it admits that people don't want a lot of extra features with it.This is why the Edge+ exists, it's for people who want a larger S6 Edge, but without the extra features of the Note 5. As a strategy, it does make sense, but I do miss the Note as it was. More power, bigger screen and some neat features made that handset one of the best out there. WATCH: Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ Long Term Review [brightcove videoID=4487483461001] Design Here Samsung has scored with me. The metal frame, curved from glass front and stylish glass back are perfection. Samsung lent me the Edge+ in gold, it looks stunning. Sadly the metallic colours like silver and gold both show fingerprints quite extensively, as does the black. White is much better, but the least interesting colour in my book. The phone has a weight to it that's encouraging. It's just right and the balance is good. Holding it in one hand, and close to the bottom doesn't make it feel like it's going to tip out of your hand. You need to be a bit careful, of course, and the glass makes this phone a little bit more slippery than others, but it's worth it for that finished style. Fingerprints To the best of my knowledge Samsung hasn't improved the fingerprint scanner in the S6 Edge+ over the smaller S6 models. However it does work absolutely brilliantly. Unless I'm being silly, the phone easily recognises my thumb first time and unlocks the phone for me. I'd even go so far as to say that Samsung has got close to [entity display=\"Apple's\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"apple\" ticker=\"AAPL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/280\"]Apple's[/entity] iPhone 6 scanner, but the 6S is supposed to improve things further still.The fingerprint scanner is important here because Android Pay and Samsung Pay are both starting their global rollout. Having fingerprint scanners makes this a much better experience, and I've loved using Apple Pay, so I'm excited to get paying with Android phones too. Sadly, the backwater I live in - the UK - has neither Samsung or [entity display=\"Google's\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"google\" ticker=\"GOOGL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1821\"]Google's[/entity] service yet. Android, in general, is also going to increase its reliance on fingerprint scanners over the next year, so having it a good one is really important. The edge No, not that dude from U2 , the curved display around the sides of the S6 Edge+ that give it a unique look that separates it from pretty much every other device out there.Like the S6 Edge, the larger plus-sized model uses its edges for some very minor enhancements. Honestly, I almost never use them, although Samsung's newly-added ability to quick-launch apps from the edge is a real win for me. I just need to train myself to use this new feature. As before, you can use the edge to get in touch with your favourite contacts and adding them here also assigns them a colour. This is used when you put your phone face down, and a call from one of these people comes in. Their colour will pulse along the edge, lighting up the surface below to let you know who is ringing. You can cancel an incoming call by putting your finger over the heart rate sensor. Another useful feature, although no one ever rings me so it's not one I use a lot. Android and Samsung As much as I think Samsung would like to switch its phones to Tizen and have more control over the ecosystem, I also know just how much Google and Samsung mean to each other. Samsung has given Google a huge number of devices to sell Android on, and has helped Google's OS become a massive global success. Google has reciprocated by giving Samsung a well-built OS along with a fantastic app store. Samsung still likes to exert its influence over Android though. Like all Galaxy phones, the skin gives the handsets a unique Samsung look. It's good too, it's not like the clunky design of the Galaxy S and S2, it's fluid, fast and pretty. If you hate it there are ways to tone it down, but I find it pleasant enough. This goes against my inner nerd, who demands I flash everything with a barebones Android build. The truth is, Samsung's work into its design is actually pretty useful.I like the Flipboard screen too. From home you swipe right and a news digest is presented to you. I use this quite a lot, and I find it a really nice way to sample news from a wider selection of places than I would normally think to check.For those who want a more \"stock\" Android look, there are plenty of launchers and themes which can restore this for you. Performance Having just talked about the Samsung UI, it seems fair to talk about the performance of the Edge+ too. Some people had issues with slowdowns on the S6, but I never saw than in my long-term review sample. The S6 Edge+ is, for the most part, the same. I did have one problem as I was writing this review where the entire UI crashed after becoming very slow. It recovered quickly enough though, and hasn't happened with any regularity. Camera Like the S6, the camera in the S6 Edge+ is stunning. Samsung has nailed photography, and while its photos are a little more hyper-real, and highly-saturated than the iPhones they still look great.What cameras in phone really rely on is being able to take amazing photos, on auto, as quickly as possible. So for me, the S6 Edge+ wins because it has the option to start the camera with a double-tap of the home button, you're then dropped into photo mode with HDR engaged, and you can snap either a single photo or hold the shutter button to grab a whole sequence. Results are, mostly, excellent. In low-light you'll see noise being removed and the resulting image is softer. It's not the end of the world, and it's quite amazing to see what camera phones can do now in subdued light. The optical image stabilisation helps here, because it gives you a slightly longer exposure time before you see camera shake creep into the image as blur. Battery I've just come off the iPhone 6 Plus as my long-term test phone, before that I was using the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. I honestly think that the S6 Edge + has the worst battery life of them all. I don't do forensic testing, but I use these phones day in, day out as my main (and basically sole) phone.The iPhone 6 Plus was a massive surprise to me. I do wonder if the iPhone users who complain about their battery life have used Android phones. I'm a hard user when it comes to mobiles. I'm rarely not looking for new emails and I tend to run apps like [entity display=\"Slack\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"slack\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102483\"]Slack[/entity] and Skype which can reduce battery life quite substantially. No matter what though, I find the screen on the S6 Edge+ to be the main issue. And that's logical, this is a bright, high-resolution panel that takes a lot of power to drive. Knocking down the brightness helps, but the internal battery just struggles to cope with the demands of a phone-addicted tech writer like me.On the plus side, the Edge+ charges almost unbelievably fast. Stick it into a good charger - avoid wireless - and watch it go. You can put 50% charge in over the course of less than 20 minutes. The last 50% takes longer, but when you're desperate that little boost can be a huge benefit. Verdict For me the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and S6 Edge+ are the pinnacle of hardware design. Apple does things beautifully, but in a different way. Samsung is showy, and uses the edge display as a gimmick. Apple, on the other hand, uses that more tasteful all-metal design and beautiful rounding to make its handset look stunning.Aesthetically, the S6 Edge+ is a crowd pleaser. Ergonomically it can annoy in very minor ways, as I mentioned in my section on the edge display above. No worries though, the S6 Edge+ is, without doubt, one of the best phones of the year.For me, I'm happy with the standard-sized edge. Somehow the extra screen real-estate of the S6 Edge+ doesn't impress me as much as the larger Note 4 did over the Galaxy S5, say. Even so, the phone's massive screen is a joy to use and, frankly, the best display in any phone right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T14:04:13.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
