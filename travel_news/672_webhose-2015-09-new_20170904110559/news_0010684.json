I chanced upon this serene stretch of beach on my recent motorcycle ride through Kerala. This beach lies a bit north of Kappad beach, one of the famous and pretty beaches north of Kozhikode. In simple terms, the Poyilkkavu is a fishermanâ€™s beach and that is its charm. It is untouched by travelers and even domestic tourists and yet offers everything that Kerala stands for, be it greenery, coconut palms, delicious food and gorgeous beaches. This is a kind of place you would like to spend to detox yourself from your normal fast paced routine. And I did precisely that when I stayed at the Liberty House, the only homestay or should I say accommodation on this entire village and beach stretch. Be it fishing during changing tides, going for lazy walks on the beach, visiting village temples, interacting with authentic Kerala countryside people or simply putting your feet up on your room balcony and reading a book while listening to the sound of lapping waves, this place offers this and more. If you are a good walker, you can walk to the neighbouring Kappad beach and attempt to walk all of its length or you could explore the village plantations and paddy fields, which also run for a good distance. If you wish, you could opt for day trips to Kozhikode and nearby tourist spots, but if you are like me, you will stay put in this village and soak in the rich countryside and remote beach atmosphere. The rooms here are simple and so is the food, but that was perfect for me as I did not want anything fancy. I just wanted a sensational place to blow my mind, tasty and simple Kerala food to fill my stomach and a comfortable room to sleep in. I got more than I wanted through a balcony with a view, great hospitality shown by the homestay owner and total value for money. If you want to know more details about this place, its location, its room rates and activities that you could indulge in here, you can look up the Liberty House website .
