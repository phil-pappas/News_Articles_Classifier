Stelia Aerospace will award a contract for the serial production of A350 XWB high-tech elementary parts to ESM, a subsidiary of Nimrod Group. In order to implement the contract, Nimrod Group/ESM is establishing a subsidiary in Poland named Azura Polska. The newly formed company will be located in Łódź.\nThe decision to establish Azura Polska in Poland is a result of Airbus Group’s long-term industrial strategy to grow its existing footprint in the country and develop it into its fifth industrial base in Europe. “Nimrod Group and Airbus Group are proud to be pioneering partners into the set-up of the new aerospace initiatives in Łódź,” said Sebastian Magadzio, President of Airbus Group Polska. “Airbus Group is already a well-established player in the Polish aerospace industry with its PZL Okęcie in Warsaw and Mielec, Astri Polska R&D center and the Airbus Helicopters design office in Łódź.” The country has become a trusted place to do business, with Polish manufacturers supplying parts for the full range of Airbus aircraft.\nAirbus Group’s sourcing from Poland amounts to well above € 200 million, including aerostructures, systems and services, and the company employs a local workforce of close to 1,000 highly skilled employees.\n“We’ve been preparing for quite some time for the launch of a new industrial base in Europe,” said Eddy Ephrati, President of Nimrod Group. “This new contract for A350 detail parts is now putting Azura Polska on the fast track, with the first deliveries from Poland scheduled for early 2016,” he added.\nAirbus Helicopters is also set to create many direct and indirect jobs when its H225M Caracal programme starts local production in Poland, so the company convinced their supplier base to accompany them. “While our original plan was to establish our new factories elsewhere in Europe, Airbus Group’s and Airbus Helicopters’ leadership has convinced us that Poland was a better option. Poland offers an especially young and highly skilled workforce in the aerospace industry,” added Ephrati.\nAirbus Helicopters has invited Azura Polska to join its new industrial campus in Łódź, home of the Caracal Final Assembly Line. Łódź is already home of the Airbus Helicopters engineering office, created in February 2015. “We are very happy with the response of some of our key suppliers to answer our call to follow us to Poland, and Nimrod Group has been among the most supportive ones. We are looking forward to becoming good neighbours in our industrial campus and to grow our business together” said Christian Cornille, Airbus Helicopters’ Executive Vice President for Industry.\nSource:- Airbus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:28:25.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
