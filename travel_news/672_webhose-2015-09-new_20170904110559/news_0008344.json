International travel to the United States generated $220.8 billion in 2014, supporting 1.1 million jobs. China is an important contributor to revenues generated by international travel to the United States. \nToday, US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker joined President Obama and President Xi for the conclusion of a week of productive discussions between the two countries. The two leaders announced the US-China Tourism Year for 2016, a new initiative that celebrates the recent reciprocal extension of visa validity and supports increased travel and tourism exports. Partnering under the framework of the US-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT), the two sides will work together to expand and shape US-China travel and tourism, and strengthen the bond between our two peoples. \nFACT SHEET: US-China Tourism Year \nInternational Travel to the United States \n• China was the number two country for visitor spending to and within the United States in 2014 with an estimated $23.8 billion spent on travel and tourism. \n• China accounted for 2.9 percent of total international arrivals in the United States in 2014, with an estimated 2.2 million travelers (a 21 percent increase over 2013). \n• National parks are a significant attraction for Chinese visitors to the United States, with 40% saying they had been to a national park when visiting. \nChina represents a significant growth market: According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, China is the world’s largest tourism market, representing more than 100 million outbound travelers in 2014, and Global Chinese overseas travel expenditures in 2013 were a record $129 billion. US - China Tourism Year \nThroughout the year, the US Department of Commerce and the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA), in collaboration with Brand USA and other partners, will design and execute a year of events and activities that will promote and further open travel between the United States and China, expand market access, and advance initiatives to ensure a quality visitor experience for increasing numbers of travelers to and from both nations. \nThe US - China Tourism Year provides a platform for the United States and China to continue to improve and upgrade systems to accommodate anticipated travel flows by: \n• Continuing progress on visa processing: About 2.5 million visas have been processed for Chinese citizens since the announcement of validity extension in November 2014, a 52.6 percent increase over the same period in the previous year and a substantial growth in first-time applicants. \n• Improving the border entry experience: The United States will continue to make progress toward a “Best in Class” arrivals experience for international visitors and will develop and make more readily available Chinese language materials and website pages. \nIncreased travel and tourism also requires dynamic, modern aviation systems, capable of supporting increased passenger and cargo traffic. Both governments will continue efforts to develop aviation policies, institutions and services to ensure the system adapts to meet the needs for both immediate and long-term growth. \nAdditionally, recognizing the important role that natural landscapes play in attracting visitors and promoting conservation, the Chinese Government and the US National Park Service will partner to share lessons learned and best practices in the designation, development and management of a Chinese national park system through a Statement of Cooperation. US and Chinese land and water governance agencies also will work to further their partnerships around sister parks, sister fish and wildlife reserves, and cooperation on forestry management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T00:31:16.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
