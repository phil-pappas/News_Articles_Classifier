They are children, parents, and dedicated supporters from the George North School of Hope. We set up the school in Mathare, Nairobi, two years ago. Mathare is one of the biggest slums in Africa. Ready for action: training at the school I got to know George well when I was coaching him here at Llandovery College, and he was aware of Challenge Aid, a charity I had founded. George has always said that he will do anything that he can for Challenge Aid, and two years ago we held a lunch in London at Brasserie Blanc, hosted by John Inverdale. While George was doing the Q&A with John, an idea began to germinate in my mind – what if we could create a school in George’s name? It struck me that we were probably going to raise £7,000 from the lunch, which is what it costs Challenge Aid to set up a School of Hope. There’s not much that surprises him but having a school with his name in an area of deprivation in Kenya is awesome. He’s really humbled by it. I asked George if we could name it the George North School of Hope and have him as the figurehead. He was absolutely blown away by the idea. I think he still is. Rising to the Challenge Challenge Aid has 25 Schools of Hope dotted around Nairobi and elsewhere. For the children there, it’s an alternative and complementary form of education. Some kids do go to school and do their homework in the evening, but others aren’t able to or can’t afford it. Place to play: the ground at the school Perhaps they’ve got to go to work during the day. They will come and do their homework in the evening. Some of the girls might have to look after younger siblings. The community gives us some space, which we make safe and waterproof. We put in lighting, desks, chairs and an up-to-date library of 200-300 textbooks. With Schools of Hope, the first year we put in £4,000, the second year we put in £2,000 and then the third year £1,000. Thereafter, the community takes over. The whole thing has to be sustainable. Rugby’s international union The George North School of Hope has a membership of 70 and they actually train twice a week in rugby. Recently, we held a boys and girls rugby tournament. I think we had 16 teams there. You’ll see from the photographs the scrubby piece of dirt they played on, and will notice the people running around it with bare feet. It’s just incredible. Run with it: women's rugby is popular too Challenge Aid has got five Schools of Hope just in Mathare now. We need to get George out there. Rugby is becoming more and more popular in Kenya. Quite a few people there know about George – and I know George well enough to know he’s a very considerate and conscientious young man. He says there’s not much that surprises him or takes his breath away, but having a school bearing his name in the middle of an area of deprivation in Kenya is awesome. He’s really humbled by it. I think the School was something very significant to him. I’ve never taken someone to Mathare or any other slum who hasn't had his life changed by it. George wants to come when the Rugby World Cup is over. It will be a great moment in his life. • Now read Iestyn's first blog: 'George North is a role model for our kids' • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T21:15:49.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
