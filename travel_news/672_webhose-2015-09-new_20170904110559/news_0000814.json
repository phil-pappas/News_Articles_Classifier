Photographer's Note \nThe evening silence of the higher reaches of the Himalayas is a sublime moment, a moment of prayer & bliss.... and what I am saying has nothing to do with religion. Here, the gigantic mountain broods over Jomsom, as the last golden light vanishes for the day. Nilgiri forms the cornerstone of \"The Great Barrier\" to Annapurna I, but it is more than just a barrier to 8000 meter glory. It is in fact a beautiful, massive, tri-summited peak, whose scope and relief dominate the Kali Gandaki Valley floor from as far south as Tatopani to as far north as Kagbeni. The three summits are Nilgiri North (7061), Nilgiri Center (6940), and Nilgiri South (6839). Each rise more than 4000 vertical meters from the valley. Nilgiri sits astride the line of the Himalayan rainshadow phenomenon, separating rhododendron filled jungle from arid, desert-like hills within the span of a few hours walk. As one proceeds, or rather, is pushed by the steady wind along the valley floor, the impression is that Nilgiri could separate two planets. French Guide Lionel Terray, along with Sherpa Wongdi, led three Dutch clients, the Van Lookeren Campagne brothers, to the summit of Nilgiri North on October 26, 1962. Terray, a veteran of the 1950 Annapurna I expedition among many other ridiculously difficult climbs, put a line up the north face to the west ridge, following the ridge the last 1800 ft. to the summit. Three camps were used as well as fixed ropes. Nilgiri South was climbed via the Southwest Ridge in 1978, Nilgiri Central via the East Ridge in 1979. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T23:23:28.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
