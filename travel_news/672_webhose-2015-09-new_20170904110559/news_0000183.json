There, the police came on and the girl was taken off the plane.\n'Even when she was in the police car, she was kicking and screaming, it was a shocking incident.'\nThe plane was delayed for around an hour, before flying on to Ibiza.\nThe plane was delayed for around an hour at Barcelona Airport, before flying on to Ibiza to allow passengers to enjoy their sunshine holiday\nThe male passenger says that it was announced the girl would be 'banned for life' from easyJet for the behaviour, but he thinks serious questions need asking as to how the woman, who he says was 'about 22 or 23,' was allowed on the plane.\n'I just can't believe they let people like that on the plane. It was clear to see she was not fit to fly,' he added.\n'But I must say I thought the easyJet staff on board handled the situation brilliantly, as did the captain.\n'As she was being led off, everyone was booing, and she was still kicking off.'\nA spokesperson for easyJet told MailOnline Travel: 'easyJet can confirm that flight EZY3043 from London Stansted to Ibiza diverted to Barcelona due to a passenger onboard behaving disruptively.\n'The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is always easyJet's priority. Police met the aircraft on landing and the passenger was arrested. The aircraft has continued to Ibiza.\n'While such incidents are rare we take them very seriously, do not tolerate abusive or threatening behaviour onboard and always push for prosecution.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1MSIA0Z"], "published": "2015-08-28T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:21:48.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
