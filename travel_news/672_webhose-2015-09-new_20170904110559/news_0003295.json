The Himalayas are a tourist destination which gives us goose bumps making us crave to be in the abode of nature with its mesmerizing beauty. The Spiti Valley is a desert mountain valley situated in the Himalayan Mountain Range. Being situated near Tibet and Ladakh it possesses a distinctive Buddhist culture. The valley is one of the least populated regions, guaranteeing a peaceful stay here. The valley has two lakes which are its star points and a must visit if you happen to travel here. It is accessible via Kinnaur from Shimla route. Chandra Taal It is also known as Moon Lake since Chandra means Moon and Taal means Lake. The name of the lake is derived from its crescent shape. It is situated at an altitude of 14,000 ft in the Himalayas. The actual interior of the lake is located in the Spiti part of the Lahul and Spiti District, Himachal Pradesh. You can also reach via Kunzum Pass which is 8 km from the Lake. The lake has a serene feel with a tinge of green appearing from its bright blue color. It is a popular destination for those who love to trek and camp. Being located on a rough terrain it is only accessible by foot. Chandra TaalPicture credits: www.holidify.com However the Forest Department has banned camping right next to the lake from the year 2010 to maintain its cleanliness and virgin beauty. The barricade is up to 2 km to avoid parking of vehicles near the lake. The area before the barricade is where you can accommodate yourself in some fixed camps. The region has a lush vegetation of Alpine during summer. Also there are small temples along the periphery of the lake. The vast meadows on the banks of Chandra Taal blossom during springtime providing a heavenly treat to visitors. It is believed that this grassy plain was once a glacier. The place has many legends which are nothing less than fantasies. One story is of a mermaid living in this glacial lake while the other says a shepherd fell in love with a fairy and spent time with her underwater.

You will also come across a monastery here which is 1200 years old known as Dhankar Gompa. Foreigners have to pay a fee of 100 INR to visit the monastery. If you observe it from a distance it appears to be virtually falling on you since it is built on a cliff. In order to reach the lake one has to go through a steep walk. Camping here is forbidden since the lake is a source of water for the village. The geographic structure here is like pointed pencils just higher and sharper. The village is situated at an elevation of 3890 m.

The air here is very thin and one can get exhausted very easily. The lake has a beautiful backdrop of snow-capped mountains along the grazing bed of green pastures. There are accommodation options available at the village else you can stay with the monks in the hostel.
