With Labor Day and the unofficial close of summer arriving, Rand McNally editors offer up these five inspirational trips to ease the transition into the autumn season.\nIf you're looking for incentive to pack up the car, consider this: Gas prices are trending about $1 under what a gallon cost last year,* making travel more affordable. These trips and more can be found in Rand McNally's fall edition of its Best of the Road® U.S. Travel Planner & Atlas:\nMonterey, Calif.\nMonterey's highs of 70s this time of year make it a great place to bid farewell to summer and welcome fall. Take in Cannery Row ( www.canneryrow.com ) shops, restaurants, and nightspots in the one-time sardine canneries, or check out the Monterey Bay Aquarium (886 Cannery Row, 831-648-4800, www.montereybayaquarium.org ), featuring exhibits on sea otters, sharks, jellyfish-and sardines, of course.\nCrystal Bridges Museum of American Art – Bentonville, Ark.\nCrystal Bridges Museum of American Art (600 Museum Way, 479-418-5700, crystalbridges.org ) includes great views of native Ozark forest and galleries with works by American masters like Norman Rockwell , Winslow Homer, and Edward Hopper .
