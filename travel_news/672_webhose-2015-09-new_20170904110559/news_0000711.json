The travel options at Ladakh stretch from mountains to monasteries. In our previous features we brought to you the amazing Pangong Tso and Tso Moriri. Continuing the aura of more majestic lakes, Ladakh has a few more options which are yet to be discovered. Tso Kar This is a twin lake which has its eastern part with fresh water while the western part is saline. They are connected with a small stream. It is also known as Tsho Kar or the White Lake for the immense amount of salt and borax which gets deposited on its banks. It is situated in Rupshu Plateau with an elevation of over 14,700 ft in the southern part of Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir. Tso Kar is 160 km south of Leh and is 540 km east of Srinagar, capital of J&K.

But there are large breeding colonies of grebes, brown-headed gulls, strip geese and terns in its tributaries. The main attractions here are the black necked cranes which come here to lay eggs and have a wingspan of almost 8 ft. The basin of Tso Kar is adjoining to the More Plains which are home to the kiang, Tibetan gazelles, wolves and foxes. The nomads residing here own horses and yaks. Must read: Placid Precious Pure: Pangong Tso The lake is set with a mesmerizing backdrop which is a sight that soothes our senses. The nomads here make a living by collecting salts from the banks and selling it to the surrounding regions. Tso Kar is easily visible from an airplane arriving at Leh but unlike Pangong Tso and Tso Moriri, very few people have discovered the astounding beauty of this place.

If you are concerned about safety then you can make bookings at Leh. There are a number of hotels to suit every budget and preference. The food here is very basic, so if you’re picky make sure you carry some packed food. Kiagar Tso It falls on the way to Tso Moriri and is another addition to the beautiful lakes of Ladakh. It is located in the Changthang Plateau and mostly is inhabited with nomads called Changpas. It is situated at a height of 4000 m. Tso Moriri is about 30 km from here. Like the others this one is also a salt water lake. Mountain fauna like sheep, goat, yak and wild ass can be spotted here. Kiagar Tso Must read: Encounter the tranquil Tso Moriri Kyun Tso & Ryul Tso These are also twin lakes where one is brackish and other is sweet. Located near Nyoma and Hanle they are 5000 m above sea level. Kyun Tso is also known as chilling Tso. Very few tourists visit here since the route is tough and there are permit issues. The route is from Mahe > Nyoma > Nidar > Thit Zarbo La. Kyun TsoPicture credits: www.dgrin.com Mirpal Tso Mirpal Tso is near to chusul and is completely isolated. The bed of lake is sandy and south end has fresh water.

Chagar TsoPicture credits: Ramíž Rázá Stat Tso & Lang Tso This is also an addition to the twin lakes of Ladakh. It is located in Zanskar region of Ladakh near Pansi la which is the highest point in Zanskar. Stat TsoPicture credits: Indranil Kar/ Facebook \nA travel to these lakes needs to be well planned, they are situated on high altitudes and remote areas where there are limited options of food, water and other supplies. Make sure you have carried all your essentials especially sunscreens and lotions to keep your skin hydrated. Such gorgeous beauties are hard to find and very few tend to survive when the world is in a race for development. Free Press Journal requests its readers to take a step for a better environment in keeping these virgin beauties clean.
