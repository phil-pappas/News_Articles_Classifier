That experience starts at home when you book or check-in, and the Street View trusted tour is an exciting addition. It will help passengers to plan their journey and for those who have never visited LCY, they can see what they’ve been missing out on.”\nThe photography took place earlier this year, when panoramic photographer Hugh Flouch, from Red Wheelbarrow Photography, spent three days using a specially rigged DSLR camera to capture every passenger area ‘on film’. This included the airport’s entrance, check-in area, cafes, relaxing restaurants and seating areas for customers.\nThe thousands of high-resolution digital images were then carefully ‘mapped’ together to create a seamless virtual experience, familiar to users of Google’s ‘Street View’.\nThis enables users to explore world landmarks, discover natural wonders, and step inside locations such as museums, arenas, restaurants – and airlines – with 360-degree views.\nBritish Airways’ double-daily Club World London City service was launched in September 2009 and since then both aircraft have clocked up over 18 million miles as they have flown customers in luxury between London and New York.\nCustomers on the prestigious flight – which carries Concorde’s former flight numbers – can enjoy a ‘private jet’ experience, with three cabin crew to serve a specially prepared in-flight menu, fine wines and snacks as they wing their way in privacy across the Atlantic.\nThey can watch their in-flight entertainment on specially configured iPads and stay in touch with friends, family, or the office, during the flight thanks to OnAir connectivity which allows them to go online and send and receive emails and text messages.\nCheck in is just 20 minutes before departure at London City, if customers are carrying luggage, or just 15-minutes with just hand luggage. Customers can also enjoy London City Airport’s only private airline lounge, which is specially-dedicated for the Club World London City service, to relax in and enjoy a drink or bite to eat before their flight.\nIt’s also the only transatlantic service which offers customers pre-clearance of US Customs and Immigration, thanks to a brief stop-over for refuelling in Shannon, Ireland on the BA001, which then allows customers to land at JFK as domestic customers, taking them just minutes to go from landing to boarding a taxi to continue their journey to their final destination.\nUntil the end of September British Airways is also offering every customer flying from London City to New York a full-sized bottle of unisex Penhaligon’s fragrance and cabin crew are serving customers a cocktail inspired by some of the ingredients that go into every bottle of the special fragrance to mark the opening of Penhaligon’s first Manhattan store.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T20:07:33.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
