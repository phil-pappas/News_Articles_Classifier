All have been enjoyable in their own way but the ones that really stand out are those that were created by companies who are undoubted experts. This one word covers many aspects. Expert knowledge of the destinations, so you get the most out of your visit. Expert organisation, so travel arrangements are seamless. Expert at knowing what makes you tick – and what you’ll find captivating. And one name springs immediately to mind: APT. APT offers crafted escorted tours and river cruises covering the most alluring destinations in the world such as South America, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Asia and the best of Europe. The expertise comes from more than 88 years of experience. APT was started by Australian Bill McGeary who converted a truck into a tour bus. His descendants still run the company, each generation passing on invaluable knowledge and building a powerful reputation for providing the highest quality holidays. APT’s 98 per cent customer satisfaction rate is remarkable. It’s often the attention to detail that turns a good trip into a great one and again, this comes through expertise. An itinerary that is put together by those who intimately know the destinations visited will always be more rewarding for the holidaymaker. Canada’s Rocky Mountaineer train A tour director can have a huge influence on the overall experience and those employed by APT have drawn high praise from guests, not just for their professionalism but for their insights into local culture and their humorous anecdotes. Working with hand-picked local guides, they really bring destinations to life. I’ve come to realise that on a high-quality tour or river cruise you will see and learn about so many fascinating things that you’d never discover by travelling independently. APT likes to surprise and delight guests by exceeding expectations. Meeting local people and engaging with their culture, attending a private concert in a historic building, riding on a heritage railway, staying in a superior-view room in a luxurious hotel, enjoying a fabulous meal in a beautiful setting – all these and more meld to form an extraordinary showcase of each destination. If you’re happy with just a quick overview of each place on a tour or river cruise, there are plenty of options. If you would prefer your senses to be sharpened and your experiences to be more profound, then APT has few equals – a statement supported by its accolades as Best River Cruise Line and runner-up in the Best Escorted Tour Company category in the most recent Telegraph Travel Awards. Spellbinding tours Knowing its guests like to have a choice and to tailor their holidays to suit their preferences, APT offers two types of escorted tour. APT Luxury Tours are the unsurpassed way of seeing a region or country. Painstakingly created by the company’s specialists and involving travel by road, train and ship, they are luxurious and genuinely life-enhancing. Escorted by a tour director and expert local guides, you’ll travel in smaller-than-average groups and stay in the best available accommodation, typically five-star and often in mesmerising locations where APT has chosen rooms with a view. Tours benefit from guided sightseeing but also give you freedom to make your own discoveries Two standout features make these tours so impressive. The Signature Invitations, some exclusive to APT, are unforgettable ways of indulging in the best sightseeing, cultural or dining encounters. In New Zealand you’ll board the renowned TranzAlpine train for a wonderful journey through the mountains. If you choose Canada, you’ll enjoy private access to The Butchart Gardens before the crowds arrive. And there are many more tantalising examples to choose from. Tuck in to local cuisine Then there’s Freedom of Choice. In many places, APT will offer a selection of activities so you can tailor-make your holiday. Few companies offer options like this and it can make a real difference; giving you the option to visit a historic monument, relax in a spa or join a cookery class, depending on your preference. In some locations, the concept even extends to dining; you can try authentic food in a local restaurant and APT will pick up the tab. However, the most surprising aspect of choosing APT Luxury Tours is that all these marvellous experiences are included in the price. Indeed, the fully-inclusive pricing extends much further – to entrance fees, transfers, tipping, porterage and more. APT also offers premium escorted tours in its Travelmarvel by APT collection. Put together with the same scrupulous care as the luxury programme, these four-star tours offer more flexibility while maintaining an exceptional level of service. These tours benefit from included guided sightseeing at the major landmarks and hidden gems but also give you the freedom to make your own discoveries. Travelmarvel’s tour director will help you not only to appreciate what you experience with your group but advise on making the most of independent time. A number of exciting Insider Experiences are included on Travelmarvel tours, such as venturing out on the ice of the Athabasca Glacier in the Rockies or cruising among the reed islands of Lake Titicaca in Peru. On Travelmarvel tours you will stay in good-quality hotels conveniently located for local sights – and enjoy special stays in some truly unique or historic locations. Exquisite river cruises Just as with the escorted tours, APT offers both Luxury and Travelmarvel versions of its exceptional river cruises. Luxury river cruises, including Royal Collection river cruises in Europe, utilise the finest ships on each river and are the pinnacle of journeying by water at a fully-inclusive price. On board, you’ll be indulged with plush cabins – many with innovative twin balconies – sumptuous public areas and spacious sun decks. As for the rivers, there are the historic waterways of Europe, exotic journeys in south-east Asia, a cultural voyage through India and a colourful glide along America’s Mississippi. Travel to unforgettable sites, including Iguassu Falls, South America Like the escorted tours, you’ll be treated to a host of Signature Invitations. In Europe, for example, you’ll be cosseted with a cocktail reception and private classical concert in Vienna’s newly renovated City Palace, an APT exclusive. Plus you’ll enjoy Freedom of Choice options at many destinations around the world, all included in the cost, so you can choose to zip off on a quadbike or even try out an Apsara dance class in Vietnam and Cambodia, depending on your own interests. Travelmarvel’s four-star river cruises offer superior comfort and outstanding value Dining on the ships is delectable. In Europe, the vessels are the only ones to be inducted into the prestigious La Chaîne des Rôtisseurs culinary organisation. Plus, on European cruises savour a special degustation menu in the Chef ’s Table Restaurant, at no extra cost. Complimentary drinks are included at lunch and dinner on board, plus on Royal Collection cruises in Europe and luxury cruises along the Mekong, complimentary beverages are available throughout your cruise. What’s more, on all luxury river cruises in Europe, Asia and along the Mississippi, APT will arrange for you to be picked up from your home for a private airport transfer. Travelmarvel’s four-star river cruises offer superior comfort at a price that represents outstanding value, providing a good balance of included sightseeing and leisure time, giving you free time to explore at your own pace. You’ll enjoy premium accommodation, all on-board meals and complimentary house wine, local beer and soft drinks at lunch and dinner.
