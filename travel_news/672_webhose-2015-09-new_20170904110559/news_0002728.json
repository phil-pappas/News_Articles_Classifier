It was just as the farm-to-table movement was starting in California.” \nEstes, once featured on the Iron Chef TV show, eventually ended up in Seattle, working for chef Tom Douglas. Naturally, there’s a story involved. \n“I was a vegetarian, but I was in charge of a place that featured a different animal every night. Monday might be goat night, Tuesday was rabbit, that sort of thing.” \nHere she pauses for comedic effect. \n“I stopped being a vegetarian.” \nNowadays, she is back in California with her husband and daughter, keeping pigs, goats, sheep, rabbits and ducks in their yard in Forestville , a sleepy spot just north of Sebastopol in Sonoma County. \n“People ask me about the animals,” Estes says. “I tell them they live free and they have fantastic lives, followed by one really bad day.” \nBad days aren’t something one associates with Sonoma. It’s an area that has long been in the shadow of its famous neighbour valley to the east, Napa . But it’s arguably a more relaxed and definitely more diverse area that encompasses both rolling hills, rich valley lands and a special slice of the California coast. \nThe world has cottoned on, as Sonoma is now one of the top food and wine destinations in a state that’s famous for both. \nAt ZAZU, Estes and her husband whip up a fantastic fried chicken sandwich with avocado, a very good burger featuring their own Black Pig Meat Co. bacon, as well as killer pasta with local clams and more bacon. They also serve a wonderful bacon-infused bourbon mixed with maple simple syrup and fresh lemon and lime juice. \nJust a few steps from ZAZU is Macphail winery , where you’ll not only find an intriguing sculpture consisting of crushed red wagons rising to the ceiling but also sensuous Pinot Noirs from a variety of nearby vineyards. Because some Sonoma vineyards are near the coast, the region offers up not only the full-bodied, fruit-bomb wines California is known for, but also lighter wines kissed by ocean fog. \nFurther up the valley in Geyserville is the Francis Ford Coppola Winery , which could be described as a wine/food/California good life theme park. They make everything from approachable California reds to sparkling wines to earthy, spicy reserves selling for close to $100 CDN. The labels on some of Coppola’s wines are done by artist Dean Tavoularis, who did set design work for Coppola’s Godfather movies. \nI luck into the reserve tasting with Coppola worker and wine fan Jim Steis, who suggests not just swirling wine around in your mouth but chewing it.“That way you get all your taste buds going and your tongue gets involved and the inside of your cheeks, too. Then your brain says, ‘Hey, what’s going on in there?’” \n“Swooshing the wine around in your mouth also is great,” Steis says. “But there are two rules. Don’t breathe in. And don’t wear white.” \nCoppola’s Sonoma complex also has a 279 sq. m. pool with a large lawn and cabanas you can rent for the day. You’ll also encounter a bocce ball court, a North American Indian teepee for kids’ activities and a gazebo-like structure modelled after the one featured in the Lake Tahoe scenes in The Godfather II . \nSonoma also is home to several local breweries; a nice contrast to the wine scene and one that helps illustrate Sonoma’s relaxed atmosphere. \nStumptown Brewery in Guerneville is a roadhouse-style joint with dollar bills tacked to the ceiling and a shady patio out back with views of the slow-moving Russian River. The Bush Wacker Wheat is great for a hot, sunny day, while the Rat Bastard Pale Ale is better suited to a cool California night. \nIn trendy/hip Healdsburg, Bear Republic offers up a large variety of boutique brews. The town can be a tad on the precious side, but at Bear Republic I saw a local woman who appeared to be approaching 70 years of age with spiky silver hair plunk herself down at the bar. “Assume you want the usual,” said the bartender, pulling on a tap that dispenses a thick, rich stout that would give Guinness a run for its money. \nThe next morning I take breakfast at Cape Fear Café in the adorable community of Duncans Mills, which features clapboard wood-front shops and cute stores selling tea, antiques and knickknacks. The original café owner is from North Carolina and has festooned the place with posters from the ‘Cape Fear’ movie, as well as chicken statues and Hawaii cruise line posters. \nAfter dining on farm-fresh eggs and delicious French toast with molasses butter, I chat up co-owners Judy Serkissian and Kim Jackson, whose family hails from Hamilton, Ont. They smoke their own locally-caught salmon and cook everything from scratch in a tiny kitchen. \n“Even a lot of locals don’t know about us,” says Serkissian. “But we’ve got this beautiful atmosphere and these great old buildings. It’s like time never got here.” \nIF YOU GO \nYou can save a bundle by renting a house with Russian River Getaways . I stayed in a three-bedroom unit with full kitchen, two baths and a hot tub just steps from the Russian River in Guerneville, where you can float on inner tubs or canoe and kayak to your heart’s delight. There are a variety of hotels and B&Bs in the area, many of them in the town of Sonoma or nearby Santa Rosa, home of the late Peanuts comics creator Charles Schulz. \nThe Applewood Inn in Guerneville has nice units and a wonderful restaurant that might serve the best gnocchi you’ve ever had. \nDEAL OF THE WEEK \nThe InterContinental Toronto Centre has a nice Motown package available. For $599 the Boogie Down at the InterContinental Toronto Centre package features accommodations, free WiFi, two orchestra level tickets to Motown The Musical, chocolates, a Motown The Musical CD, breakfast at their restaurant, Azure, and more. \nDESTINATION OF THE WEEK \nCalgary is an increasingly hip city. Hotels such as Le Germain , Kensington Riverside Inn and Hotel Arts match up with the hippest offerings of any Canadian city. Calgary also has become a solid food destination, thanks to restaurants such as Model Milk and Charcut , a meat-lovers delight. The owners of Charcut recently opened Charbar in the happening riverfront area just east of downtown. Be sure to check out the funky shops and galleries in the super-cool Inglewood neighbourhood . © Copyright (c) Postmedia Network Inc.
