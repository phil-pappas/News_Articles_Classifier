Ellise Pierce Special to the Star-Telegram 1 of 4 Order Reprint of this Story \nFrom my home in Paris, I recently phoned my cell service provider in the U.S. to straighten out an oddball charge that showed up on my bill, and over the course of the nearly hourlong call, I learned that the guy who was helping me lived in Texarkana, loved having his friends over on game days and was planning to enroll in culinary school so he could improve his cooking skills. Mainly for football-watching parties, he told me. \nThese days, having people over to watch an afternoon of football is as much about the food as who has just scored — practically all of those I’ve talked to seem to be trying to up their game in terms of what they’re serving. \nIt can be a tricky proposition, however, because you don’t want to spend too much time in the kitchen. Of course, if you assemble most of it ahead of time, you won’t have to. \nThe goal should be to provide a buffet filled with food everyone can pick up and eat with their hands. It doesn’t need to be fancy, but it does need to be good. \nThe quickest way to get there? Quality ingredients. Fresh mozzarella — not the shredded stuff you find in a plastic bag — for the French bread pizzas. Bread from an artisanal bakery. Fresh basil. \nAssume that you may not be able to get everything you need in one place, and build that extra running-around time into your planning. Plan to do everything in advance — the shopping, prepping and pre-cooking — so you can spend your time with your friends. Because that’s what football-watching parties are really all about. \nEllise Pierce is the author of “Cowgirl Chef: Texas Cooking With a French Accent” (Running Press, $25). http://cowgirlchef.com , @cowgirlchef. \nFrench bread pizza Margherita \nMakes enough for 2 baguettes, about 6-8 servings \nThere’s quite a bit of wiggle room in this recipe — all baguettes are not created equal, and some are much larger than the ones I’ve used in this recipe — so adjust accordingly with your sauce and cheese. 2 baguettes, cut in 6-inch pieces and split in half 1 recipe pizza sauce (recipe follows) 2 (4.40-ounce) balls fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces Handful of fresh basil leaves About 1 cup fresh grated Parmesan \n1. Heat oven to broil. Put baguette pieces on a cookie sheet and toast until they’re medium-brown. \n2. Lightly sauce toasted baguette pieces and scatter mozzarella pieces on top — you want these to be nearly covered with cheese but not all the way. Put baguettes back into oven and cook until cheese melts and is bubbly. Remove and add torn basil and a generous amount of Parmesan.
