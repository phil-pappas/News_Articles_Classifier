The five-star resort resembles a green oasis with colorful gardens and a private island connected by a bridge. It is an ideal place to enjoy the sandy beach or see dolphins swimming in the Red Sea. All of the suites, along with some rooms, offer fantastic sea views while others overlook the garden or lake. It is the closest resort to Cairo International Airport, taking 1.5 hours to reach on the newest motorway. \nGreen Globe congratulates Movenpick Resort El Sokhna on its recent certification and notable compliance score of 83% against accredited criteria. \nAcknowledging his resort’s achievement, General Manager Wael Allam referred to a quote by Yehuda Berg who once said, “If we each take responsibility in shifting our own behavior, we can trigger the type of change that is necessary to achieve sustainability for our race or this planet. We change our planet, our environment, our humanity every day, every year, every decade, and every millennia.” \n“Likewise, the Movenpick EL Sokhna team is doing it from their hearts and has successfully achieved certification renewal for the period 2015/2016,” added Mr. Allam. \nThe property uses the Hotel Optimizer management system designed by Green Globe’s preferred Middle East Partner FARNEK to record and monitor all energy and water consumption as well as benchmark waste quantities. Energy reduction strategies include the installation of energy efficient equipment and facilities, deployment of timers for outdoor lighting and shutting down computers when not in use in back of house areas. \nTo conserve water dual flush toilets, and low flow faucets and showerheads are deployed in guest rooms and public areas. Also, a towel and linen reuse program is in place. And filtered water is offered to guests in the spa and fitness center instead of bottled water in disposable plastic bottles. \nWaste reduction initiatives include the recycling of glass bottles, aluminum cans and plastics. And, as part of its reuse program suppliers provide food deliveries in reusable containers. While towels, linen and bedspreads no longer in use at the resort are donated to local charities. \nRestaurants at Movenpick EL Sokhna purchase fair trade or eco-certified products to reduce the property’s impact on the environment. Eco-friendly biodegradable cleaning products are used for the same reason. And biodegradable amenities in dispensers are preferred in guest rooms, public bathrooms, spa and the fitness center. \nTo contribute to regional development the resort uses local, sustainable goods and services where possible. And as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility program Movenpick El Sokhna has established a partnership with Ibtissama, a local NGO to welcome mentally challenged staff at the resort. \nAbout Movenpick Hotels & Resorts \nMovenpick Hotels & Resorts, an international upscale hotel management company with over 16’000 staff members, is represented in 25 countries with 82 hotels, resorts and Nile cruisers currently in operation.
