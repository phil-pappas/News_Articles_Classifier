It will also fly a direct route from Nelson to Queenstown over the winter season. These routes are not currently flown directly by any airline in Nelson. \nChief executive Ewan Wilson said ticket sales had been \"encouraging\" since being advertised online three weeks ago. He said this confirmed there was a niche market for travel between those regions. \n\"With new airlines like Jetstar coming along it's great, but they are using existing routes already flown by Air New Zealand. We are pioneering new gateways [out of Nelson] so that's got to be exciting,\" he said. \nThe new airline has purchased a Saab 340 34-seat aircraft which will begin test flights from Nelson Airport in October. The first KRA flight will take-off from Nelson on October 28. \nWilson, who is based in Hamilton, said Nelson had huge growth potential. \n\"In the past it's been about Wellington Airport being a central location [to fly from] geographically, but Nelson is becoming an incredibly important hub,\" he said. \nWilson is not new to the aviation industry- he launched the short-lived airline Kiwi International Airlines about 20 years ago. \nIt lasted about two years before collapsing in 1996. Wilson was later convicted on four charges of fraud, which he said were clean-slated after seven years. Ad Feedback \nThis time around would be \"hugely different\", said Wilson. \n\"I'm being careful to avoid direct competition [this time], I've learnt so much [since launching Kiwi International Airlines].\" \nKRA will not only be passenger focussed. Wilson said freighting would be a big part of business. \n\"Freight is a huge part of it, we can grow even more by bringing fresh produce between [regional] markets, there's a real opportunity there,\" he said. \nScope for additional regional routes was also on the cards for the airline, including a possible Nelson to Napier and Nelson to Tauranga route. \n\"But the possibility of those routes will be driven by how these first ones go,\" said Wilson. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T00:07:23.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
