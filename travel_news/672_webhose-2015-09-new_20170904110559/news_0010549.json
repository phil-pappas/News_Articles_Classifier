(BST), has been awarded a contract with China Railway Corp. (CRC) to supply 15 CRH380D very high speed trains for the country’s rapidly growing high speed network. The contract for 15 eight-car trainsets is valued at approximately 2.4 billion Chinese RMBs ($ 381 million US, 339 million euro).\nBombardier owns 50% of the shares in BST, which is consolidated by Bombardier Transportation’s partner CSR Sifang Rolling Stock Co., Ltd. Based on previous orders, BST started delivering its newest generation high speed train CRH380D in the first quarter of 2015. This early follow on order shows the confidence of China Railways in BST’s leading high tech product.\nJianwei Zhang, President of Bombardier China said, “China now has the world’s longest operational track mileage and largest number of high speed trains. This market represents a tremendous opportunity where we have been successful by offering innovative and highly reliable products. Bombardier is very proud to be involved in China’s new high speed railway age by delivering leading edge, very high speed rail equipment through Chinese joint venture expertise and resources. We are confident to deliver more next-generation rail equipment with the most advanced rail technology for China from within China.”\nThe new trainsets will be an integral part of an evolving high speed rail capability in China. With a maximum operating speed of 380 km/h, the CRH380D is a new generation high speed electric multiple units developed by BST. It is powered by BOMBARDIER ECO4 technology and a highly efficient BOMBARDIER MITRAC propulsion and control system, both supplied by a separate Bombardier Chinese joint venture, Bombardier CPC Propulsion System Co., Ltd. (BCP).\nThe CRH380D EMU consists of eight aluminum carbody cars and is equipped with VIP seats, first class seats, second class seats and a dining car. The trainsets will be manufactured at Bombardier Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation production facilities in Qingdao, China. Engineering will take place in Qingdao and at Bombardier centers in Europe with project management and components provided from sites in Europe and China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:08:31.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
