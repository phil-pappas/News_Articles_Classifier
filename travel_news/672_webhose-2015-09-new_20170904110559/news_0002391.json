The segment ended perfectly with former Daily Show host and Colbert mentor Jon Stewart ripping off a catcher’s mask, turning to the crowd to say, “Let’s play ball.”\nColbert could not have asked for a warmer reception from the audience, which chanted his crowd name, “Ste-phen, Ste-phen,” and greeted him with a standing ovation. One had the sense that they had been waiting a long time — nine months, in fact — for this party to get started.\nColbert’s energy was terrific. He did high kicks with his bandleader Jon Batiste and traded jokes with CBS CEO Les Moonves, who had a front-row seat with a buzzer that let him switch Colbert off for re-runs of The Mentalist , the show that occupied the timeslot after Letterman went off the air.\nMoonves is, of course, expecting Colbert to be a competitor to frontrunner Jimmy Fallon, whose Tonight Show is a proven success. His jokes were hit and miss. An involved joke about a cursed ram’s head bearing a red amulet simply did not register.\nHe did better with an extended funny bit about Donald Trump’s complaint that Nabisco is going to make its cookies in Mexico, eating Oreos at his desk while showing video of Trump bloviating at various campaign stops. When Colbert delivers lines like “He’s the only candidate brave enough to deport the Keebler elves,” he lives up to his reputation as the smartest guy in the late-night game.

Without anything to promote, Clooney was just there to be nice and put Colbert at ease. Colbert had some fun teasing Clooney about him being arm candy for his wife, the accomplished Amal Clooney.\nColbert really hit his stride, though, during an interview with presidential candidate Jeb Bush, asking him substantive questions about changing the country’s political narrative and how he was different from his brother George. Bush tried for some humour here, saying he was younger and better-looking, but Colbert said, “I’m talking policy.” And then Bush rather frankly admitted that his brother the president didn’t show enough fiscal restraint.\nSwitching gears again, Colbert turned the last segment of his debut night over to Jon Batiste and Stay Human, his band, which delivered an amazing version of the Sly and the Family Stone classic Everyday People , with a special cameo from the mighty Mavis Staples. Proving he’s game for almost anything, Colbert joined the chorus and closed out his debut on a well-deserved high note.\nFans line up for the first taping of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on September 8 in NYC.
