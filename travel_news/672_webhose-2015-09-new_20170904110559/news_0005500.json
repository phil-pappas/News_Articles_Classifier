From the country’s famous jam ó n ib é rico de bellota from the Extremadura region to tortillitas de camarones (shrimp fritters) from Cádiz, Madrid’s mercados are a great way to taste some of the best of what Spain has to offer.\nUnlike some European countries (ahem, France) where lunch is always at 1, dinner’s at 8 p.m. and not one minute earlier, if you’re in Spain and you’re hungry, you’re in luck. You can pretty much eat as much or as little as you’re in the mood for, all day and all night.\nAs many Madrileños do, I ate tapas for lunch, then I had tapas again for dinner, often at one of the city’s mercados . I loved having so many choices, not getting more food than I could possibly eat, and paying so little, often 10 euros (about $13.80) or less. Who needs a market for groceries when eating out is this much fun?\nMercado San Ildefonso\nArturo Sánchez hams swathed in purple wrapping hang in the window, beckoning passersby. If Spain’s pre-eminent seller of pork doesn’t lure them off the sidewalks of Calle Fuencarral, one of the city’s busiest shopping streets, then the cones of chorizo probably will — it worked for me. Who can resist a meat cone?\nDiscreetly tucked into a corner space next to the British chain Superdry and across the street from Lacoste L!ve, you might walk past Madrid’s new three-level gastro market if you didn’t know it was there. I did. Twice.\nWord’s getting out among the locals. On a recent Sunday at 2 p.m., it was tough to find a seat, even on the patio on the second floor. There are young families with children; 30-something couples drinking Mahou Clasica beers, eating just-fried-in-olive-oil potato chips and splitting an order of croquettas; hipsters on laptops; couples with Nespresso bags, taking a break from shopping (many stores are open on Sunday).\nThe food here is all tapas, mostly Spanish, and often served up with a contemporary twist, such as gazpacho de remolacha , beetroot gazpacho with goat cheese and crispy corn at DP Tapas. There’s also Anios Vinoteca, a wine bar, where you can snag a glass of wine for 3 euros ($4.08); Va de Gamba, for shrimp and potato chips; Cultura Cafe for crêpes; fresh seafood, oysters and razor clams at La Lonja; and all sorts of kebabs at La Brochette. Nearly a dozen places in all, and that’s just on the second level. There’s an outlet of Poncelet Cheese Bar on the ground floor, hamburgers and a juice bar, too.\nWith industrial lighting, concrete floors, exposed vents and nubby metal staircases, the space feels like being in someone’s three-story loft. Thumping, nondescript house music plays in the background and puffs of mist help cool off even the city’s hottest summers.\nHours: Sunday through Wednesday, open noon to 1 a.m.; Thursday, Friday and Saturday, it closes at 2 a.m.\nFuencarral 57, mercadodesanildefonso.com\nMercado San Miguel\nJust behind one of the city’s biggest attractions, the 16th-century Plaza Major in the city center, is the beaux-arts market that was originally built in 1916 to resemble Les Halles in Paris, which explains the gratuitous use of wrought iron throughout. It’s a stunning structure, now restored and reopened for five years. It has more than two dozen eateries arranged on the periphery, many with a bar and pull-up stools, along with additional tables in the middle.\nIf you go early, say just before noon (and I recommend you do), it’s easy to walk through the nearly empty space and decide what you’d like before ordering. A half-hour later, it begins to get so crowded with locals and tourists with cameras you can’t move, and certainly can’t see what’s for sale behind each counter.\nFrom the entrance, if you walk to the far left, past the vegetable stand and the vendor selling fresh fruit juices, you’ll find El Señor Martín selling cones of fried calamari with a wedge of lemon for 13 euros ($17.69), and at the cerveceria next to that, you can order your fried pimentos de padron (for $9.25) along with espárragos a la plancha (for $17.14). The cerveceria , apparently a local favorite, filled up before anything else here.\nThere are fresh oysters at Daniel Salut; organic empanadas (chicken curry, sardine and tomatoes); fresh fried chicharrones for 2 euros ($2.72) and tiny cones filled with marcona almonds, lightly dusted with piment ó n (the Spanish smoked pepper) for 1 euro ($1.36). Carnivores will love the choice of 30 different hamburgers at Raza Nostra, from teriyaki to foie-stuffed; and BBQ Market where you can get “10 types of sausage, 10 types of salsa” on a bocadillo , including: bacon and cheese, chorizo and cheese, plus others.\nOf course, I did the opposite. I started at the sweets end of the market, on the far right end, and ordered a tiny violeta ice cream cone straightaway — it’s apparently a Madrid thing, and after one taste, it’s also now mine. I wanted to try one of the marshmallowy Spanish meringues in cupcake papers, but I resisted the urge. Instead, I wandered back to the other side of the market, and ordered up a pulpo a la Gallega tapa for 1 euro and another with salmon and basil.\nHours: Sunday to Wednesday from 10 a.m. to midnight; Thursday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m.\nPlaza de San Miguel, mercadodesanmiguel.es\nMercado San Anton\nOpen just three years since its redo, this 19th-century market now recast as a gourmet food court offers high-end groceries on the ground floor (fresh fruit, fish, meat and cheeses, from manchego to brie de Meaux; artisan breads; and — need I say it? — all sorts of ham), plus a shop that sells only olive oil. But the real draw here is the tapas, located mostly on the second level, just up the escalators next to the hamburgesa stand.\nEven when it’s crowded, which it usually seems to be here, the open atrium in the middle makes it seem less so. The tapas stands wrap around this big square space and the tall, wood-topped tables and black Tolix stools sit near the middle.\nMore so than the other mercados, this one stands out for a couple of reasons. One, the tapas offered here are more international. If, for example, you’d prefer a Greek dolmade with a Mythos beer, you can get it here. Or sushi. Zucchini pizza. I saw a whole lot of people eating hamburgers, strangely, but just as many eating the national comfort-food dish, huevos rotos (broken eggs): potatoes with ham and eggs, broken and stirred in at the last minute.\nThere’s also a full-service tapas bar, La Trastienda Tapas, on the first floor, which is where I ended up. I had sea urchin stuffed with crab; salmorejo , the cold Spanish soup made with tomatoes, stale bread, garlic, olive oil and sherry vinegar; and morcilla de Burgos: blood sausage that was mixed with rice, fried, and served with a fried padrón pepper on top. It was all delicious, every bit of it.\nWhich is why I kept going back. I also liked that it was easy to find a place to sit, and people bring you the food — you don’t have to stand at the bar and eat.\nHours: Monday to Saturday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Sunday, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.\nAugusto Figueroa 24, mercadosananton.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T06:42:42.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
