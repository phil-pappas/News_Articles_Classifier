Follow these tips for a great roadtrip. \nIf you're thinking of planning a wonderful holiday spent skiing in the Alps, figuring out how to get there as comfortably and cheaply as possible is essential. Although flying might be the first option that comes to mind, it is often quite expensive for those travelling in groups and not particularly relaxing for those with children. Driving to the Alps, however, can prove to be a wonderful experience for everyone; here are some tips to make it a thoroughly enjoyable adventure! \n1. Stay on the Right When you Cross the Border \nWhen travelling from the UK, when you reach Calais, you will see there are plenty of warning signs indicating the need to stay on the correct side of traffic. Later on, however, when your last coffee might be wearing off, you've listened to the same playlist over and over, and traffic is non-existent, you may need reminders that the right side of the road is correct. Simple tricks like a sticker with the word ‘right’ on your steering wheel or asking an attentive passenger to be on alert will make the trip much more relaxed. \n2. Take the Necessary Driving Kit \nWhen daydreaming about the fabulous time you are going to have skiing in the Alps, it's easy to forget the small details, especially if they are not a requirement back home! France requires that you have a warning triangle and a reflective jacket in your car at all times, as well as a self-test breathalyser; French policemen will not hesitate to fine you as much as 135€ if you fail to show them on request. \nYou should also remember to carry all your documentation, including your passport, driver’s license and registration, insurance details and MOT, plus a GB sticker. \n3. And Don’t Forget your Snow Chains \nThis one might seem obvious, but you would be surprised how many people think they can get away without them when going skiing in the Alps. Even if you are not holidaying in the deepest of winter (but especially if you are), it is essential to have snow chains with you. There are many mountain ports and checkpoints that will turn you back if you don’t have them with you in certain weather conditions. Additionally, practicing how to put them on and take them off a couple of times before departing might save you an unexpected headache later on. \n4. Factor in the Tolls in your Holiday Budget \nIn order to travel on many French highways, you will need to pay a toll charge. It is easier to pay this with cash and you will avoid a potentially detrimental exchange rate when your credit card is charged—so make sure you have plenty of euros with you.It is possible to get to your destination without using toll roads, but this will make the journey trickier and considerably longer in some instances. Make sure to map out your journey thoroughly before attempting it. \n5. Have Fun! \nWe also suggest you plan your entertainment; so if listening to 11 hours of French radio is not really your cup of tea, make a playlist. Make sure you pack plenty of water and snacks for everyone, as well as some blankets and pillows for those who will get a chance to sleep in the car. And don’t be wary of pit stops: everyone will thank you. \nIf you follow all this advice, your time skiing in the Alps is sure to be thoroughly enjoyable.   from ArticlesFactory.com \n\nDanielle Hodges is the Marketing Manager for Ski Amis, a specialist ski travel agency and booking service offering bonded holidays skiing in the Alps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:52:30.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
