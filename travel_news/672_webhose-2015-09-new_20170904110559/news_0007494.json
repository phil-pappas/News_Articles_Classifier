There are some notable exceptions too. France's Louvre might be the world's most visited art museum, but it doesn't even get a look-in.\nGlobal heavyweights including Florence's Galleria degli Uffizi and Madrid's Reina Sofia are similarly out in the cold.\nThe selections reflect the shift away from the art world's big boys in New York, Paris and London.\nAfter all, 2013's most attended art exhibitions were in Taipei and Rio de Janeiro, not Europe or North America.\nThe 2015 shortlist gives shout-outs to Oman National Museum, Ouidah Museum of History in Benin and other unexpected destinations which are beginning to present serious competition on the global stage.\nEating, drinking and shopping\nGetting oohs and aahs for its architecture: The Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar. In addition, the cultural institutions leading the way this year aren't just about art appreciation. They're also places to eat, drink, work, shop, socialize and even sleep.\nAs Andy Warhol once said, \"All department stores will become museums, and all museums will become department stores.\"\nSo alongside Exhibitions and Programming, museums are also judged on Architecture and Spatial Design, Digital Experience, Shopping, and Eating and Drinking.\nThere's even a category for Best Art Experience in a Hotel, with nominees including France's La Colombe d'Or, a favorite of stars including Francis Ford Coppola and Drew Barrymore.\nThe 2015 winners will be announced during the award ceremony in London on October 9.\nThe full shortlist of the nominees announced is below:\nBest Exhibitions & Programming\nTate Modern, London (UK)\nMuseum of Modern Art, New York (U.S.)\nVictoria & Albert Museum, London (UK)\nNew Museum, New York (U.S.)\nSerpentine Gallery, London (UK)\nBest Architecture & Spatial Design\nFondation Louis Vuitton, Paris (France)\nGuggenheim Bilbao, Bilbao (Spain)\nState Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg (Russia)\nMuseum of Islamic Art, Doha (Qatar)\nSolomon R.
