It offers virtually all functions of a traditional overhead console, but does not interfere with the driver's headroom. With this new overhead console, Yanfeng Automotive Interiors has reduced the weight and space required by 55 to 80 percent in comparison to conventional components. As a result, automakers can lower the rooflines while creating a feeling of greater spaciousness in the vehicle interior.\nThe Yanfeng Automotive Interiors console offers most of the features and functions of traditional overhead consoles, including lighting for switches as well as the integration of lights, microphones and garage door openers.\n\"The new slim overhead console improves interior spaciousness for vehicle occupants,\" said Han Hendriks , vice president, Advanced Product Development and Sales at Yanfeng Automotive Interiors. \"The innovative accent lighting also supports the brand identity of the vehicle.\"\nIn addition to the economical and ecological benefits of the new overhead console, the functionality, look and feel also play a role.\n\"Users can intuitively operate the sunroof from the overhead console with a swiping gesture,\" explained Hendriks.\nAdditionally, the driver can activate the emergency response button on the overhead console. With the press of a button, the basic lighting on the console changes to red and a clearly audible warning signal is sounded.\nWith its slim packaging of the overhead console, Yanfeng Automotive Interiors is supporting the design strategies of automakers towards lower rooflines or optimized windshield angles in favor of improved aerodynamics. Yanfeng Automotive Interiors is thus helping vehicle manufacturers meet guidelines for reducing CO 2 emissions while simultaneously satisfying customer demand for a more spacious feel.\nThe slim overhead console is available for model year 2016 vehicles.\nAbout Yanfeng Automotive Interiors\nYanfeng Automotive Interiors is the world's leading supplier of instrument panels and cockpit systems, door panels, floor consoles and overhead consoles.
