But the lure of Opal Reef, one of the Great Barrier Reef’s top snorkelling sites, was enough to get me back in the water.\nOpal Reef was the third and final snorkel site on our day trip and the crew of Wavelength, a snorkellers-only tour operation based in Port Douglas, had assured us they were saving the best for last. However, their assurances weren’t enough to sway my friend Yoshimi to trade the far north Queensland sun for the sea. She dozed on the bow, a world away from her home town Tokyo, enjoying our weekend escape to Port Douglas.\nDuring her short stay in Australia, I had felt duty bound to introduce her to what is arguably our nation’s best-known natural wonder. But my final pleas for her to get back in the water were met with a sleepy shake of the head. “If you change your mind, wave to me from the boat and I’ll swim back to get you,” I said, as I plunged flippers-first into the crisp Coral Sea.\nPerhaps I should have been content that we had made it that far. Just two days earlier Yoshimi had thought it pertinent to tell me she wasn’t much of a swimmer. I fired off an email to the Wavelength crew who assured me they had enough flotation devices and guides to keep Yoshimi buoyant. But it was important I swim next to her at all times, and so I had diligently shadowed Yoshimi at our previous two snorkel sites.

Source: Supplied\nHer first attempt at breathing through the snorkel resulted in a mouthful of saltwater and a wave of anxiety. At that point we saw a baby reef shark resting on the seabed. I was convinced that would send her scurrying back to Japan. On the contrary, the spectacle yanked her back from fear’s tight grip and she relaxed into the beauty of the reef.\nFrom there we floated effortlessly around The Great Barrier Reef’s underwater gardens. Wavelength takes a maximum of 30 snorkellers daily to sites including St Crispin Reef, Tongue Reef and the breathtaking Opal Reef. As a smaller, snorkellers-only operator, Wavelength has access to low-density sites designated as such by The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to protect the sensitive ecology from overuse.\nWith larger operators you can find yourself sharing underwater vistas with 60 to 300 other snorkellers and divers. Scuba divers may argue deeper dive sites provide the best way to see The Great Barrier Reef. But scuba is not for everyone. For travellers with limited time and, in the case of my friend, limited in-water experience, a small group snorkel with experienced marine biologist guides provides a far more accessible reef encounter.\nOne thing that is particularly hard to appreciate until you see it for yourself, is the variety of landscapes and marine life beneath the surface.\nSea turtles revealed themselves to a lucky few at Tongue Reef. At our second site giant clams, sea anemones and towering coral bommies were the headline attractions. But our third site, Opal Reef, showed why this place is described as a natural wonder. Its incredible coral garden would surely take first prize if the Chelsea Flower Show ever moved underwater. A parrot fish emerges from the outer reef coral. Source: Supplied\nMulti-coloured, multi-layered blooms of coral blanketed the undulating seabed. Refracted light lit the reef like a dazzling jewel. Maori wrasse lurked in the distant depths while parrotfish and blue neons dashed around .\nEyes glued downwards, gliding over valleys and hills of coral, I almost forgot sleepy Yoshimi back on the boat. I glanced up to see her still stretched out, daydreaming on the bow, while missing out on the underwater experience of a lifetime. As if reading my mind Yoshimi sprang to life and she waved to me, arms outstretched. “Are you coming in?” I called. She nodded and grabbed her wetsuit for one last glide over the mesmerising coral fields.\nLater that evening, we reflected on our reef encounter. Placed on a boat in The Great Barrier Reef, a Tokyo city-dweller can experience contentment simply lying in the sunny stillness that exists 50km offshore. It had taken a true natural wonder to lure Yoshimi from sundeck to sea that afternoon.\nGO2\nGREAT BARRIER REEF\nGETTING THERE\nFly to Cairns and hire a car at the airport for the hour drive to the North Queensland town of Port Douglas.
