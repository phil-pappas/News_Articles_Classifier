The ruling cannot be appealed. \nThe KLM case was brought by a passenger whose flight was delayed by 29 hours because of what the airline said were two faulty components on the aircraft. \nKLM said the delay was out of its hands as the parts were within their recommended lifespan and the manufacturer hadn’t warned which defects may arise once the components reached a certain age. \nHowever, the court said technical faults, even those caused by unexpected events, are inherent in the normal exercise of an airline's activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:38:37.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
