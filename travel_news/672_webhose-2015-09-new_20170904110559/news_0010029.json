Over the past year, Pierre Ferchaud has brought his expertise of the luxury hotel sector to Hôtel Metropole Monte-Carlo. His management style of combining professionalism, high standards in quality, employee empowering measures, attention to detail and listening skills, has brought the iconic hotel to a new level of hospitality, for Serge Ethuin to continue in the future. \nEthuin graduated from the Ecole Hôtelière in Strasbourg, and began his career in 1983 working for the Hilton Group as a Receptionist. He quickly evolved within the group as Front Desk Manager and then Business Development Manager assuming functional as well as operational responsibilities. In 2008, Ethuin moved to the II Rome Cavalieri; the first European hotel to integrate into the prestigious Waldorf-Astoria Collection. Over his six years at the property, he inspired a dynamic workplace between the three Michelin Star restaurant La Pergola, the Grand Spa Club and the unique art collection, which led to expansion into emerging markets for the hotel. In 2011, Ethuin was awarded the Best General Manager by Waldorf Astoria Worldwide. After 30 years within the Hilton Group and the Waldorf Hotels & Resorts, Ethuin took the reins as General Manager of the Royal Monceau Raffles Paris. Commenting on his appointment at Hôtel Metropole Monte-Carlo, Serge Ethuin said ‘It’s a great honour to be chosen to manage the Hôtel Metropole Monte-Carlo. My main objective is to lead the teams in order to build the establishment’s future together.’ Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:58:04.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
