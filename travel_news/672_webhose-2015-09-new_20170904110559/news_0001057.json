To-date, we have 167 registrations from China up from 22 last year while Japan is our largest international market with 700 participants.”\nEarlier this year the Sydney Marathon was awarded the prestigious top honour of the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) – Road Race Gold Label status, which recognises the event as one of the world’s leading marathons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:22:49.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
