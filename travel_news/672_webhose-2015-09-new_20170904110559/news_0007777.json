It demonstrates the strength of our distribution network, its enthusiasm for our new products and its commitment to our brands,\" said Anne Bélec, senior vice-president, Global Brand and Strategy. \"They are looking for products that will appeal to consumers by their design and technologies as well as their comfort, durability and performance.\"\nNew Can-Am Defender utility side-by-side vehicle\nFor those who know the Can-Am brand, BRP makes its debut in the utility side-by-side segment by injecting some of the Can-Am DNA into the Defender model. The Can-Am Defender vehicle was designed and engineered from the ground up, to establish new standards in terms of torque and power, as well as versatility to cater to all types of outdoor activities. BRP leveraged its proven Rotax engine technology to create a work-focused version of the durable V-Twin Rotax engines, specially calibrated to offer the best torque of the industry: the new Rotax 50-hp HD8 or 72-hp HD10 engines.\nCan-Am Spyder\nFor 2016, BRP will expand its presence in the largest segment of the motorcycle industry, the cruiser segment, with additions of the F3-T and F3 Limited models to its existing F3, F3-S and F3 Special Series vehicles in the Can-Am Spyder F3 line-up. These new models are loaded with comfort and convenience features to offer greater freedom, flexibility, and extra cargo space. All Spyder F3 models are equipped with BRP's exclusive UFit system that allows riders to adjust their riding position to find a truly customized fit, feel and riding experience.\nSea-Doo takes riding to the next level... again!\nMany innovations to the Sea-Doo line-up, including the first intelligent braking system (iBR), first on-water suspension and more recently the Sea-Doo Spark watercraft have made the Sea-Doo brand number one in the personal watercraft industry. In 2016, BRP is taking it to the next level with a 300-hp model equipped with the new Rotax 1630 ACE engine: bigger, more efficient and more powerful than any engine ever produced under the Rotax brand. The combination of the increased power and efficiency of the Rotax 1630 ACE engine, the confidence provided by the advanced ergonomics of the Ergolock system and the control and peace of mind that come with the intuitive iBR system will bring the rider experience to the next level.\nNASCAR sponsorship\nIn addition to introducing an array of parts, accessories and clothing (PAC) to match the riding style of Can-Am and Sea-Doo customers, BRP also announced a partnership agreement with Kappa, a sport performance clothing manufacturer, who will introduce four clothing collections, including one exclusive to BRP's Can-Am dealer network. Through this agreement, BRP's Can-Am brand becomes a sponsor of Kappa's GoFAS racing team in NASCAR's 2016 Sprint Cup .\n\"We are putting everything in place so that 2016 can be a phenomenal year for BRP, its dealers and our customers,\" concluded Bélec. \"We have great products: we are entering the side-by-side utility segment, the largest in that industry, with a vehicle that stands out from all the others with tough features, capable performance and clever adaptability. We are also expanding our Can-Am and Sea-Doo line-ups, offering strong PAC and adding fantastic product recognition through the NASCAR sponsorship.\"\nAbout BRP\nBRP (TSX:DOO) is a global leader in the design, development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of powersports vehicles and propulsion systems.
