Jul 29, 2015 at 12:00pm PDT \n\"It might sound crazy, but nothing can go wrong after take-off.\" \nTrolltunga, also known as 'Trolls Tongue' is regarded as one of the most scenic places in Norway. \nThe cliff, which gives incredible views of snow-capped mountains and the jewelled lake below, can be reached by an 8 hour return-hike through sublime mountainous terrain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:46:18.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
