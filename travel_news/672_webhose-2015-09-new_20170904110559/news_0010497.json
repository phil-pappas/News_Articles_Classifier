Seem beyond reason.\n— Rupert Murdoch (@rupertmurdoch) September 3, 2015\nOn Wednesday, Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox paid $725 million for 73 percent control of a partnership with National Geographic’s media arm, giving Murdoch and his media empire sway over the magazine revered for its science coverage.\nThat has the magazine’s fans worried:\nThat sound you hear? 100k hearts breaking. @NatGeo sold to Murdoch after 127yrs of nonprofit science journalism #WHY https://t.co/YpCWfLpdOV\n— Shannon Wianecki (@swianecki) September 9, 2015\nExecutives at Fox and National Geographic underscored that the new partnership — which will be governed by a board with an equal number of representatives from each organization — would not affect the magazine’s standards of reporting.\n“I don’t think that they would be investing in this brand if it weren’t to keep the quality of what National Geographic stands for,” National Geographic CEO Gary Knell told the New York Times .\nNational Geographic’s Editor in Chief Susan Goldberg told The Washington Post , “Fox has acknowledged that they have not always represented the National Geographic brand in some of those programs in a way we loved or even they loved,” but added that the partnership was “great news” that would support the magazine’s journalism.\nBut outside onlookers, pointing to scientists’ criticism of Murdoch’s comments and Fox’s climate change coverage, gloomily speculated about the effect of the partnership on the magazine’s famous science journalism.\nRupert Murdoch buys National Geographic.

That’s my depressing take on it.”\nSpeaking to National Geographic staffers Wednesday, James Murdoch said he revered the publication, which he has read since childhood. He told the New York Times he has no plans to change the culture or mission of the magazine.\n“It is a creative business we are in, and we are in creative alignment,” he said.\n© 2015 , The Washington Post", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NatGeo", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/business/media/national-geographic-and-fox-form-a-commercial-media-company.html?_r=0", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/national-geographic-magazine-shifts-to-for-profit-status-with-fox-partnership/2015/09/09/7c9f034e-56f0-11e5-8bb1-b488d231bba2_story.html?tid=pm_pop_b", "https://twitter.com/nxthompson/status/641672907761012737", "https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/10/business/media/national-geographic-and-fox-form-a-commercial-media-company.html", "https://twitter.com/rwhewitt/status/641673817497071616", "http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3plf1VGlccM", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/WHY?src=hash", "http://t.co/V1zTcCEV7j", "https://twitter.com/swianecki/status/641717697537900544", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-16/scientists-take-issue-with-rupert-murdoch-s-remarks-on-climate-change", "http://www.climateweeknyc.org/events/un-climate-summit", "http://t.co/nRlTtE193h", "https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/639405066433220608", "http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/07/james-murdoch", "https://t.co/YpCWfLpdOV"], "published": "2015-09-11T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T21:39:44.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
