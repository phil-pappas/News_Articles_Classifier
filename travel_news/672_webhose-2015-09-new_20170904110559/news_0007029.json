In the last 3-4 years the market has caught up slowly and is heading towards a boost in passenger flow with comparative airfares and a choice of many airlines on the offer. The setback after the 9/11 had put the industry on the rear but the slow but steady surge is making the industry look up with more hopes and promises.\nHowever, security issues haven’t altogether deserted this front of the industry and the major accidents of the MH370, MH17 and the German Wings crash did cast its depressing spell and somewhat overshadow the stark growth that the industry had begun to enjoy. But such incidents are unavoidable and the industry continues to serve customers with safety measures. Disturbances in destinations often lead to an impact in passenger flow and airlines go through dull periods. The Military coup in Thailand which is a prominent tourism destination suddenly left the airline industry at a loss as passenger flow naturally fell during that period.\nAirline industry still maintains its profits through the domestic segment which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the entire industry compared to 40 percent of international travel. The uncertain terms of the industry often lead many airline services to make up for their losses through ancillary services like extra fees for baggage, extra amenities, ticket changes, frequent flyer programs, etc.\nThe Aruvian Research analysed the Global Airlines Industry, and published a comprehensive research report of 27 key airline markets such as the United States, China, India, Germany, United Kingdom, Russia, South Korea and others. 75 major airlines in the global airline industry were also studied by them .They feel that the United States, China, Russia, United Kingdom and Germany had some of the world’s largest fleets in the years 2013 and 2014. Emerging markets such as Latin America and Asia Pacific remained the high growth markets for aircraft manufacturers.\nThe analysis was drawn by the volume of passengers, industry profitability; industry segmentation and fleet development. The global airline passenger traffic was also taken into account. The forecast is till the year 2019. The global airline industry and the overall industry outlook, forecast and analysis on emerging airline markets have been discussed.\nEmerging markets of Bangladesh Bulgaria, Indonesia, Iraq, Kuwait and Vietnam have been extensively analysed. Apart from the 27 countries an evaluation had been drawn on 78 major airlines in the global airline industry which would benefit in the global transition. A complete study on how their industry could be staged with more competitive strategies leading to global airline value attracting better opportunities for the industry. The report is an ideal tool for global aviation leaders who will find the research and analysis helpful for their growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:09:11.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
