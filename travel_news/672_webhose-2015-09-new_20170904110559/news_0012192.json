The figure compares to 280,000 for the whole of 2014.\nThe U.N. refugee agency separately gives the figure of more than 300,000 migrants and refugees having crossed the Mediterranean so far this year, compared to 219,000 crossings in the whole of 2014.\nAround 2,500 have died this year so far, compared to 3,500 for the whole of last year, it says.\nWhere do they come from?\nSyria and Afghanistan were the two countries most represented among migrants entering the EU, according to Frontex.\nThe top five countries for arrivals in Europe on all sea crossings are Syria (43 percent), Eritrea (10 percent), Nigeria (5 percent), Somalia (3 percent), and others (27 percent), according to the U.N.\nNine out of ten of those making the Mediterranean crossing to Italy are Africans, however.\nBut nearly one-fifth of those coming over the Balkans are Kosovans, leading Germany and other EU states to call for a register of ‘safe’ countries to which migrants can be returned.\nWhere are they arriving, and by what routes?\nGreece, Hungary and Italy are bearing the brunt of the problem.\nGreece had the most landings with nearly 200,000 this year, the U.N. says. Greece sees so many because of people getting boats from Turkey for the islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos and Kos.\nItaly has seen 110,000 landings this year, with people taking the central Mediterranean route on rickety boats from Libya. But numbers have slowed due to the breakdown of order in Libya and the danger of the route.\nThe Western Balkans have seen a huge surge in arrivals of mostly asylum seekers fleeing Middle East wars, who cross the region after crossing by boat from Turkey to Greece.\nHungary alone reported more than 34,800 detections from January to July, and the area as a whole has seen 102,342, Frontex says.\nThe most popular final destinations are Germany, Sweden and Britain.\nWhat has the EU done, and what more can it do?\nThe EU was stung into action after a horrific Mediterranean shipwreck in April that left 700 migrants dead .\nThe bloc boosted its maritime search and rescue efforts and set up a military naval task force aiming to tackle people smugglers.\nIt is also setting up “hot spots” in frontline European countries to expedite the classification of newcomers as either refugees or economic migrants.\nBut plans for the compulsory relocation of 40,000 migrants, to take the strain off Greece and Italy, collapsed because of bickering between EU countries.\nIn the end they merely agreed to voluntary pledges to take in 32,000, plus another 22,500 Syrian asylum seekers currently in camps outside the EU.\nMany believe those numbers are dwarfed by the scale of the problem and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will unveil new proposals in his state of the union speech next week.\nThey may include relaxing the “Dublin rules” that Germany has already waived, which currently mean asylum requests must be dealt with by the country where the person first arrives.\nMeanwhile, rights groups advocate other solutions, such as giving work visas to refugees and migrants, arguing that it would reduce the smuggling that leads to tragedies.", "external_links": ["http://frontex.europa.eu/", "http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home"], "published": "2015-09-01T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T01:21:56.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
