Dishing out the bucks for two weeks at a beach cottage or national park, only to have a day or two of rain curtail the kiddos' outdoor agenda. However, it doesn't have to be this way. Simple art projects, digital postcard creation, social media participation and vacation-inspired poetry can all play a part in keeping the vacation blues at bay. Following are a few activities to consider for your next family getaway. Mosaics \nTile kits and grout can be a bit much to hope for on a trip to the neighborhood convenience market or nearest home department store. However, torn paper mosaics featuring scenes and land formations from the area you are visiting are an easy and affordable way to spend part of a rainy afternoon. All you need for this particular art project is basic photocopy paper, glue sticks and a small multi-color package of construction paper. \nBasically, hand-torn bits of colored paper take the place of smashed dishes and tiles, while copy paper takes the place of the plant pot or table top one would normally cover with tile pieces. The result is a flat piece of artwork that's suitable for framing once you arrive back home. Young artists simply tear small pieces of colored paper and assemble them into the scene they want by affixing them to the white background using the adhesive of the glue stick. Postcards \nHaving children make their own physical postcards out of poster board and art materials is certainly a classic choice, but if you want to move things into the digital age you may want to consider assigning them the task of creating a few digital postcards to share with Grandma and other family members on Facebook. Sorting through the backlog of digital vacation photos can easily kill a rainy morning. Once a handful of images have been selected, a digital collage image can easily be created. \nPicmonkey.com for example, allows users free use of certain aspects of the site to create simple collages with messages written in templated fonts. Children can create several based on different days and locations visited during the family vacation. By the time a small number of the digital postcards have been completed, perhaps the rain will have passed and you'll be able to enjoy a little more outdoor exploring. If not, there's always board games, lunch or the nearest museum. Poetry \nIf you've taken your family somewhere particularly inspiring, rainy days are a great time to reflect on the nature and heritage of the location through the writing of poetry. It's a great way to capture the feel of the place you are visiting, and provides parents with a unique insight into just what their children are taking away from the experience. \nOne straightforward form of poetry younger travelers can feel successful with is the classic acrostic poem. Using the letters of the destination written vertically down the side of one page, poets come up with a word or phrase starting with each letter that uniquely represents the place they are visiting. Another is haiku. With a structure well suited to nature destinations and a built-in chance to practice syllabication, this short form of poetry often produces profound results regardless of the age of the writer. If the rain continues, consider having the kiddos illustrate their poems, or have a candlelight family poetry reading after dinner. Join the conversation and share your voice. \nShow Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:12:45.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
