Some were better than others, but they were always welcome. They came especially in handy when you needed refresh yourself after a long flight. At one point, I had amassed a collection of nearly 100 from airlines around the globe. The ones from premium cabins were sold on eBay, while the rest were donated to battered and homeless women’s shelters. Although amenity kits in coach class have gone the way of the dinosaurs, you can easily build your own to use on future flights. Below is a list of 10 items that are must-haves in my amenity kit.

It holds an amazingly large number of items, plus it’s a container approved by the Transportation Security Administration . I also like kid’s pencil holders that can be picked up at any dollar store.

Sleep like a baby with an eye mask that not only blocks the light, but has space inside so your eyes don’t get dry. I'm currently loving the Lewis N. Clark comfort eye mask . 3. Ear plugs \nThe constant drone of an airplane engine, coupled with noise like screaming babies, loud conversations and flight attendant announcements for duty-free shopping can disappear with a good pair of ear plugs. 4. Noise-canceling ear buds \nIf you really want to shut the world out during your flight, invest in a pair of noise-canceling ear buds, like the Klipsch X11is I use on every flight. 5. Hand sanitizer \nI’m a germophobe, and we all know that airplanes are nothing more than flying petri dishes. I keep a small bottle of hand sanitizer I pick up for cheap at Bath and Body Works (which has the best scents). 6. Lip balm \nThe cabin air can be very drying, so you want balm to keep lips from cracking inflight. 7. Hand lotion \nAgain, with that drying cabin air, you want to keep your hands and face moisturized during your flight. A Korean Air Boeing 747. Photo by Benet J. Wilson 8. Small water spray/mister \nInside the business class amenity kit on Korean Air was a can of Evian water to spray on your face as a refresher. If you can’t find a similar can, a three-ounce or less spray bottle will do the trick. 9. Pre-pasted toothbrush \nAfter a long red-eye flight, your fellow travelers will not want to smell your morning breath. So carry a four-pack of disposable Wisp toothbrushes, which come with toothpaste built in, along with a toothpick on the end. 10. Soft socks \nCabin pressure can cause feet to swell, so you may want to slip into some comfy socks as you sit. Just remember to put on your shoes when you need to take that potty break.
