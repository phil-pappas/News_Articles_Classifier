This MOU will help bring together key Canadian and Brazilian public and private stakeholders to discuss collaboration and cooperation in areas such as airport development, air navigation, and safety.\nBombardier Commercial Aircraft has a Regional Sales and Marketing Office (RSMO) and parts services depot in São Paulo, supported by a dedicated team of local and international experts. The Latin American sales, marketing and customer services team will be strengthened further as the central office is staffed to fully support the region.\nBombardier’s current 20-year commercial aviation market forecast projects deliveries of 1,150 units in the 60- to 150-seat category to Latin America and the Caribbean (including Mexico) through 2034. Of these units, 450 units are expected to be in the Q Series 60- to 100-seat segment, while most of the remainder will be in the 100- to 150-seat segment – the segment for which Bombardier’s new advanced-technology C Series single-aisle aircraft is designed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:59:45.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
