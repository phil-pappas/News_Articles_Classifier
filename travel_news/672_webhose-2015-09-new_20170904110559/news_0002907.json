When asked how events had impacted their willingness to travel abroad, just over half said recent acts of terrorism (54%) and the migrant situation (51%) had directly influenced how they feel about taking overseas holidays. When commenting on the impact specific events have had on their travel habits: Three-quarters (75%) said they are now actively avoiding Islamic countries for holiday destinations 73% said the migrant situation has put them off travelling through the Channel Tunnel or by Eurostar Over half (54%) admitted that the Tunisia terrorist attack has put them off planning/booking a holiday anywhere abroad \"Usually when Britain has a cool and wet summer, we are keen to take holiday somewhere warm. The events of this summer, however, have impacted the choices British consumers are making about where to go. This is particularly true, at least in the short term, for some of the previously popular tourist destinations amongst British tourists,\" said Yeganeh Morakabati, Academic in Risk and Tourism at Bournemouth University. \"What is clear from the research is that the relative levels of risk perception have increased uncertainty and this has left the door open to fear. As a result British travellers are finding it increasingly difficult to decide on the safest destination for a holiday abroad.\"The research found over half (54%) feel confused and overwhelmed about where is safe to travel to, and nearly a third admitted they are not aware which countries have been put on high alert by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office for British tourists. The knock-on effect for travel habits is clear: countries that would have appealed to British tourists for a winter getaway this time last year are being avoided by 50% of travellers in favour of destinations perceived to be safer that they 'would not otherwise have chosen to visit.' 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T03:43:47.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
