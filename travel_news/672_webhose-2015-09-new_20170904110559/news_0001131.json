Exhibitors provide the latest tourism information to visitors and professional members of the travel trade. Last year, the showcase attracted over 157,000 attendees. \n“JATA Tourism Expo is just one part of the MVA’s marketing strategy to attract Japanese visitors to Saipan, Tinian and Rota,” said MVA Managing Director Perry Tenorio. “It’s essential to keep our presence in Japan, which is why the MVA has participated in JATA for many years and why it’s crucial to keep MVA funding intact. Less funding means less marketing and fewer visitors….and that means less revenue for all the government and the whole CNMI economy.” \nJATA Tourism Expo is internationally recognized as one of the largest travel events in the world. MVA will have an informational booth and present cultural demonstrations. Miss Marianas Jian Joyner will also participate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T04:19:42.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
