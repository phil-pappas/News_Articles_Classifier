Travellers will walk through the scenic Bregenzerwald countryside while staying mainly in family-run inns and eat traditional locally-produced food, including the staples of mountain cuisine, venison and cheese. \nTravellers begin their walk at Oderbildstein, passing an impressive waterfall and finishing the day with a well-deserved four-course meal at Lingenau. Hikers will then continue towards the mountains and can stop for lunch en route at picturesque Schwarzenberg with its historic clapboard houses. A cable car will take walkers high above the town of Bezau the following day, where they can walk through remote meadows to the tiny unspoilt village of Schönenbach. The journey will continue in the Bizauer valley and the wonderful experience of the “Barfussweg”, a barefoot-path where walkers can find out how sensitive their feet are to various surfaces. The following day takes hikers up in a cable car to the high pastures of the Kanisalpe, where they can watch cheesemakers at work. The final walking day will offer stunning views from the five 2000m peaks around the Damuls valley, including views of the last six days’ journey. \nThe hike is of medium difficultly, with 4 to 5½ hours spent walking each day, and is available from June to September. The package includes seven nights’ accommodation, all breakfasts, six dinners, in-route transfers and all luggage transfers – meaning hikers simply carry a day pack. A Bregenzerwald Guest Card is also included, giving walkers free access to all bus and ski-lift services. If booked before October 31, 2015, the walk can be taken in 2016 for £750 (approx $A1625 depending on exchange rates), twin-share, which is a five per cent reduction on 2015’s price, thanks to decreased costs following a weakness in the Euro . Quote code ‘PMR 16’ when booking to access the discount. \nBased in the UK and specialising in the ‘art of slow travel’, On Foot Holidays offers international walkers 24 self-guided tours across unspoilt areas of Europe for independent travellers who prefer intimate encounters with destinations.
