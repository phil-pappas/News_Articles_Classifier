The new agreement will give travel agents more confidence that they are seeing the full range of content, and “they won’t need to toggle between systems.” \nThat, in turn, will give consumers more confidence that they won’t find a better fare somewhere else, he said. \nBut for now, “it’s about getting product onto the shelf to be as visible to as many subscribers as possible,” he said. \nAir Canada last year began a major international expansion that is ongoing. “We carry 38 passengers a year, and by 2020 we expect to carry 50 million a year,” Bureau said. Amadeus has the largest GDS market share in the world, so it made sense for the carrier to broaden its relationship with the company. \nThe new deal is a full-content agreement, but Bureau said it provides a bit of “wiggle room” so that the carrier can respond more effectively to competition. \nFor example, he said, if a low-cost carrier files a new fare, Air Canada can match it immediately on its website; it won’t have to wait for its response to make its way through the next round of thrice-daily fare filing. \n“Both sides removed some old sacred cows” from the agreement, he said. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T03:27:41.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
