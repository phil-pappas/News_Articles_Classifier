Till slowly the notebook became, like a well-loved friend, a keeper of one's most important data or most intimate thoughts. \nVisitors check out the display at the fair (All photos: Saumya Khandelwal) \nAs for pens, a true collector can come up with poetic lines in their honour; lines better than that one about a pen being mightier than the sword!
