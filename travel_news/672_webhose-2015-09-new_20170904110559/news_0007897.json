For the first time, Sail Scotland are also offering FREE membership for attractions, activity providers, hospitality and retailers to make sure sailing visitors experience the best of Scotland onshore too.\nDaniel Steel, Chief Executive of Sail Scotland, said: “Scotland’s marine tourism sector already attracts visitors from all over the world, with boating alone generating more than £100 million in visitor expenditure and directly supporting almost 3,000 jobs.\n“Through the national marine tourism strategy – which aims to grow that figure to £145 million by 2020 – we are working with partners to unlock this potential for businesses all over Scotland. With the launch of this toolkit and free associate membership, we invite the tourism industry to play its part and grasp the opportunity of sailing tourism, by linking onshore experiences, attractions and hospitality with our members in marinas, boatyards, charters and sailing schools.”\nMalcolm Roughead, Chief Executive of VisitScotland, added: “From sailing and yachting to kayaking and fishing, Scotland’s coast holds huge appeal for UK and international visitors. Sail Scotland has gone from strength to strength over the past couple of years and we are delighted to work closely with a thriving industry-led group in this sector. We have used toolkits to great effect over recent years, and this will be equally effective in allowing businesses to link their offer to national campaigns and activity.”\nThe Sail Scotland brand toolkit was supported by funding from the VisitScotland Growth Fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:04:49.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
