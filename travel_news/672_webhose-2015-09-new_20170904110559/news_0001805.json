But the astronomical odds of two golfers carding consecutive aces had never before been defied – that is, until recently, when Jeff Wright and John Watters came on to the scene. The golfers, from Workington, scored their back-to-back aces on the 133-yard, par-three ninth at their club, Cockermouth, while playing in a three-ball, during a monthly Stableford. Wright, 78, who plays off 17, was first to hit the target, teeing off second. He said: “I was part of a three-ball and the first player, Steve, landed on the green about eight feet from the hole. I played next with an eight-iron, which I teed high, and it landed next to Steve’s ball, but then ran to the hole and went in. “I just stood there and could not believe what I’d just seen. My playing partners – Steve and John – both cheered and shook my hand.” But the golfing gods, in mind-bogglingly rare form, continued to work their magic as, just moments later, Watters, 73 – last to tee off – found his moment to shine. It was one of the best feelings in the world to see my ball disappear. I remember thinking: ‘The members back at the clubhouse aren’t going to believe this He said: “After witnessing Steve and Jeff’s shots, I joked there would be no room in the hole for my ball now. I played my shot with a seven-iron and it landed on the green and rolled into the hole for a hole-in-one. We all shared a joyful minute celebrating this rare coincidence.” Wright added: “When we watched John’s shot run round Steve’s ball, hit the pin and drop in the hole we stood for a moment, in complete shock. Then, when we realised what had happened, we erupted in cheer and shook hands vigorously. It appears this is the first time in the club’s history that two consecutive holes-in-one have been achieved.” Lucky for some, number 13 In a similar feat of golfing magic, two Stockton-on-Tees golfers made their own luck recently after each aced Eaglescliffe’s 13th hole during the same competition. Philip Moore, 31, and Kevin Donald, 47 – both members at Eaglescliffe GC – made it a day to remember in the clubhouse, after they each holed their tee shots on the 179-yard, par-three hole. The double ace came during a midweek Stableford competition and, further adding to the day’s uncanniness, the pair of amateurs later learnt that they had even parked next to each other before the competition. Moore, a production technician, was first to hit the target, achieving the feat with his eight-iron. The seven-handicapper, who has been playing golf all his life, said: “I hit a perfectly struck shot which landed on the front of the green and rolled towards the back-right flag. Two-for-one deal: both golfers tasted glory at the 13th “When the ball was about 15 feet away from the pin, I said to my playing partners: ‘That’s going to go in the hole.’ It continued rolling on a perfect line like a beautifully struck putt and, sure enough, went in the hole.” But, later that evening, Moore received a text message from his best friend and regular playing partner – who happened to be playing with Donald – revealing his remarkable feat had been equalled. Moore added: “At first, I thought it was a wind up, but, sure enough, when I checked the results, I soon learnt that Kevin had, indeed, achieved the same feat as me. It was a pleasure and a great honour to share my first hole-in-one with a friend and fellow member.” Donald, a drayman who plays off 14, said: “I had heard of Phil’s hole-in-one earlier in the day before I teed off, and just hoped one day maybe I could also manage the same feat – it happened a lot sooner than I thought. I knew I wasn’t going to win, as my chemotherapy has weakened me, but the ace really was the icing on the cake “On the 13th tee, after my playing partners and I shared a little joke about the hole, I pulled my rescue club from the bag and struck it well, if not a little left. The ball landed just off the left-hand side of the green, but caught the slope and kicked towards the flag. “From there, the ball started tracking straight towards the hole and, before I knew it, it was in. I couldn’t believe it and my playing partners were going mad, jumping up and down. “It was one of the best feelings in the world to see my ball disappear in the hole. I just remember thinking: ‘The members back at the clubhouse aren’t going to believe this.'” Magical moment at Southwell Meanwhile, a nuclear power plant inspector diagnosed with terminal cancer was able to defy his condition, achieving golf’s greatest glory just six weeks following a major operation. Brave Stephen Martin, 52, from Newark-on-Trent, scored his poignant ace during a men’s monthly medal competition – of which the five-handicapper was also the defending champion – at his home club, Southwell, following his third stage of chemotherapy. His timeless moment of magic came on the 134-yard, par-three seventh and was made even more special by the fact that it was witnessed by 20 of his golfing chums, inciting applause so rapturous it could be heard at the clubhouse, more than 100 yards away. He said: “Following my operation six weeks previously, I decided I would play our club championship anyway, given I was defending champion. Eyes on the prize: defending champion Stephen Martin sank a competition hole-in-one at Southwell \"It was a windy day and, as I’ve lost a lot of my power due to my treatments, I chose to hit an eight-iron on the seventh hole. “With a draw on the wind and a friendly bounce, the ball never left the flag, disappearing at a gentle roll.” And he couldn’t have picked a more opportune moment – or hole – to achieve the feat, since the fifth green at Southwell can be seen from two surrounding greens and tee boxes. He added: “Being watched by all my friends, who’ve all shown me such tremendous support since I was diagnosed, was more special than the actual hole-in-one and amplified the occasion tenfold. “I finished the tournament in sixth place, but the celebration for my hole-in-one, embarrassingly, overshadowed the celebrations for the competition’s champion. \"I knew I wasn’t going to win, as my chemotherapy has weakened me, but the ace really was the icing on the cake – we all, of course, celebrated with a bottle of scotch at the clubhouse bar.” BOSS Watches H1 Club BOSS Watches has once again pledged to reward club golfers with an exclusive watch for every hole-in-one recorded during a club competition in 2015, having given away more than £1m-worth of limited-edition timepieces since its launch in 2013. The scheme is open to any golfer whose club uses HowDidiDo – a free-to use, web-based social network for golfers – and anybody playing in official club competitions is eligible. Currently, more than 1,800 clubs use the website. In addition to the limited-edition watches, the “ace” golfers join more than 7,000 members in the BOSS Watches H1Club, which offers access to exclusive benefits and merchandise. No extra registration is required to participate in the BOSS Watches promotion as all official club competitions are recorded on the HowDidiDo system, so holes-in-one are noted and automatically ratified by the golfer’s club. www.H1Club.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:02:12.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
