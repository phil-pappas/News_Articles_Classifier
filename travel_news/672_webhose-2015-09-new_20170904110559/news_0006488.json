Comment Posted Sep. 3, 2015 at 3:50 PM Updated Sep 3, 2015 at 3:55 PM Posted Sep. 3, 2015 at 3:50 PM Updated Sep 3, 2015 at 3:55 PM WHITMAN – Gasoline is 20 cents more expensive per gallon in her town, so Karen Lambrecht knew she had to fill up in Whitman for $2.13. For the last three months, the average price of local gas has been decreasing. In the last few weeks alone, gas in Whitman has dropped from about $2.30 to $2.13, as of early Thursday. The Cumberland Farms on the corner of Route 27 and Route 18 is among the stations selling some of the cheapest gas in the state. And with the company’s SmartPay card, gas is 10 cents cheaper per gallon. “I live in Marshfield and the gas price here runs around 2.33, so finding it for 2.13 was a no-brainer to fill up,” Lambrecht said. She travels a lot for work and to visit family, so Lambrecht always tries to get the cheapest gas. “If I will be traveling there again, I’ll try to wait and fill up at those stations,” she said. “I will only travel out of the way to a certain extent to get cheaper prices, because you have to figure the cost of my time if I am traveling only to get a few cents, is it worth it in the long run.” Justin Pasco, of Brockton, was also filling up at the Cumberland Farms in Whitman this week. “I’m excited about gas prices,” he said. “I commute to Boston every day and it definitely brings the cost of going to work down. If I have to drive an extra five or 10 minutes to get cheaper gas, I will.” Pasco, 26, said saving money on gas gives him extra money to pay for parking in Boston. Gas prices in Brockton are also decreasing. At Tedeschi Food Shops on Crescent Street, regular unleaded gas was $2.21 on Wednesday afternoon. That’s where Bob Wagner was filling up. “I’ll go out of my way within reason, I think most people do,” he said. Wagner said saving about 10 cents per gallon adds up when he has to get 40 gallons every week between two cars. “We try to save every penny,” he said. The drop in local gas prices comes as Labor Day approaches. The American Automobile Association of Northeast estimates that low gas prices will contribute to the highest number of Labor Day travelers nationwide since 2008. The association anticipates 35.5 million Americans will travel more than 50 miles or more from home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T15:19:49.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
