Topping the list of contestants is John Eicke, 50, of Berlin, the only two-time winner, in 2010 and 2013. Mr. Eicke, a professional performer who goes by JOHNman, has displayed his multiple personas at arts festivals in nearly 30 countries and will return to Arnhem this year. Following are edited excerpts from an interview with Mr. Eicke.\nQ. Living statues are very popular in tourist areas. Were you inspired by any you saw as a child?\nA. Not at all. I grew up in GDR [German Democratic Republic], East Germany. Out of school I was a shipbuilder, a hard-working man. My artist life began in 1987, when I started in a theater group, just for fun. After the [Wall came down] in 1989, everything changed. In 1992 I met a group of theater guys and we decided to try something new we’d heard about from the United States called a living doll.\nPhoto Eicke in costume as \"Candyman.\" Credit JOHNman How did that work out?\nWe spent half a year by ourselves in a room with a mirror and got our first job at a Berlin fair. We didn’t know how the audience would react because it was completely unknown in Germany. But I saw immediately that when I wear a costume and have makeup on like a doll, people think, “Is he real or unreal?” Even now, that’s still the question I see on people’s faces. That’s my favorite thing.\nIs there a difference between a living doll and a living statue?\nSome people use both words, but to me a living doll is like a mannequin who comes out from the window, and a statue doesn’t really move.\nYou won your first championship with “Candyman,” a robot-like man who hands out treats. How did you develop him, and why is he so popular?\nWinning that was so special, because I completely changed my art the year before. Since 1994 I had been doing work for special events and companies, and they would choose the themes. In 2009 I decided to work for myself and create my own characters. I wanted to be interactive, give something away, and finally decided on sweets. I sewed my own red plastic suit — it makes me look artificial — and I use checkered red-and-white custom contacts. I wear skin-colored makeup anywhere people can see, because they do look. They’ll pull up my sleeve or look in my ears.\nYour second victory was for “Blanko,” a figure that starts all white and is then painted by the audience. How did you come up with that?\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story He’s my favorite because of the interaction. I was thinking to create a character who is not finished, then let the people finish him. I decided to be in all white on a pedestal with open paints and buckets and brushes. The first time ever was at the competition. I had no idea if anyone would pick up a brush, because I don’t move or explain. Finally a guy took a brush and started to paint, then other people did.\nWhat happens if you have an itch or need to sneeze?\nIt’s fine as long as you work it into the act. I never break out of character.\nAre you able to explore the countries you’re touring in?\nNot much, but the people who work at the festivals are so friendly and helpful and ask me to join them to eat or show me where they live. So it’s much deeper than a sightseeing tour. That’s the best thing.", "external_links": ["http://international.johnman.de/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/13/travel/13QNA01/13QNA01-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.worldlivingstatues.nl/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/13/travel/13QNA01/13QNA01-articleLarge.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T20:33:55.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
