After all, airlines are private companies, and you always have the option of paying more for an upgraded seat, don’t you?\nBut recent efforts by consumer advocates are turning the conventional wisdom about space on its head. Taken together, their initiatives have started an important debate about whether air travelers have a basic right to room on a plane, no matter where they sit. If these consumer groups win, it could trigger a tectonic shift that might improve air travel for everyone.\nWhy are we having this discussion now, six decades after the start of the jet age? Because seat space is shrinking at a troubling rate. The average economy-class seat pitch, a rough measure of legroom, has fallen from 35 inches before airline deregulation in the ’70s to about 31 inches today. And the average width of a coach class seat has narrowed from 18 inches to about 16 1/2 inches.\nThe changes have benefited airlines, which are now enjoying record profits. But passengers are feeling the pinch — literally — and now consumer advocates are launching a coordinated effort to defend your right to room.\nTwo consumer organizations, Travelers United (disclosure: I am the group’s co-founder) and FlyersRights, have staged a coordinated effort to change government policy on airline seats.\nFlyersRights has petitioned the federal government to create a regulation mandating minimum seat width and seat pitch for commercial airlines. And Travelers United, representing consumers on a government advisory committee, has lobbied to address the amount of space allotted to air travelers.\nPaul Hudson, FlyersRights’ president, said decreases in seat size have raised not only comfort concerns, but also safety and health issues. Emergency evacuation plans aren’t adequately tested on aircraft with smaller seat configurations, and travelers face other health risks, such as deep vein thrombosis, also called “economy-class syndrome,” he says.\nReducing seat size further, he notes, “would only expand the issue and cause greater health, safety and comfort concerns.”\nThe Department of Transportation hasn’t formally responded to the petition.\nMeanwhile, the consumer representative on the DOT’s Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protection has pushed the government to take action on the issue. Charles Leocha, chairman of Travelers United, says he successfully persuaded the committee to recommend testing smaller seats for safety. But efforts to persuade the panel to take a stand on seat size were blocked by the committee’s airline representative.\nAirlines view the committee’s failure to recommend seat standards as a vindication of their position — that government should not regulate, but instead allow market forces to set seat size.\n“Competition should determine what is offered,” says Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for Airlines for America, an airline trade group. “And as with any commercial product or service, customers vote every day with their wallets.”\nIt sounds almost laughable next to other basic human rights, until you consider the federal government regulates the amount of space animals get in the cargo hold. So it has said, in effect, that some passengers have the right to space — even if they aren’t human.\n“There is indeed an interesting argument to be made for a basic human right to physical space on an airplane,” says Laine Strutton, a Winter Park, Fla.-based human rights expert.\nSome will certainly see that as government interference in a free market. But that argument doesn’t hold up when you take a closer look, Strutton says. The state has intervened countless times to regulate practices within the private sector, including safety regulations within the auto industry.\nCritics will warn that the cost of a plane ticket will rise and that government interference will stifle competition. But do you really want to be flying in an ever-shrinking, unsafe and unhealthy space that doesn’t respect your human dignity?\nChristopher Elliott is online at elliott.org.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T06:46:24.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
