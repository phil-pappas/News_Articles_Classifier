Andrew Cuomo's office shows the proposed overhaul of New York LaGuardia Airport. (Photo: New York Governor's Office via EPA)\nCONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Several weeks ago I asked a simple question that generated a complex answer: How much tax do you pay for a plane ticket? The purpose was to illustrate how mandatory taxes and fees are used to fund the nation’s commercial aviation infrastructure. But even Americans who don’t fly support U.S. airlines.\nThe issue of government subsidies became red-hot in recent months as American, Delta and United aligned under the Partnership for Open & Fair Skies and asked the White House to oppose expansion into U.S. markets by three Gulf carriers — Emirates, Etihad and Qatar. Proponents for the U.S. Big Three claim aviation agreements “are being used in ways that are contrary to free market competition and U.S. interests” because the Gulf airlines are state owned.\nUSA TODAY\nU.S. to investigate Gulf airlines for alleged subsidies\nHowever, in various ways and to various degrees, every airline on Earth is funded by its home government, and that certainly is true here. “There’s not a playing field in the world that is level,” says Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition and an opponent of restricting access to Gulf airlines. Other parties — including U.S. carriers FedEx, JetBlue and Hawaiian — agree with Mitchell and have challenged the Big Three’s claims they’re protecting American jobs rather than protecting their turf.\nOf course, it’s worth stating that each of the Big Three has outsourced thousands of jobs — ranging from reservations to aircraft maintenance — to companies outside the U.S. And all three have partnered with carriers receiving direct state aid. As Delta objects to subsidies for rival airlines in the Gulf, it recently bought a stake in marketing partner China Eastern, which is heavily subsidized by the Chinese government.\nUncle Sam’s largesse\nIn large measure, U.S. legacy airlines actually were created by federal largesse, particularly the Contract Air Mail Act of 1925, which provided agreements and subsidies that pioneered what would eventually become the carriers’ domestic route maps. As the Smithsonian noted , the U.S. industry in the 1920s “depends for its existence almost wholly upon orders placed by Government services.”\nDuring World War II, domestic airlines were further bolstered by the Air Transport Command and other government programs that funded the movement of civilian and military personnel and equipment throughout the world. In the 70 years that have followed — during war and peace — the Civil Reserve Air Fleet program and other initiatives have awarded countless military contracts to airlines — but only those based in the United States .\nThe Pentagon has aided U.S. airlines in other fundamental ways, primarily by providing a no-cost flight academy that has continually fed American carriers with the best-trained pilots, mechanics and technical employees for decades. Then again, it’s difficult to even imagine what the U.S. airline industry would look like without the aeronautical developments and technologies pioneered by the U.S. military that then trickled down to commercial aviation. The “Jet Age” that began in earnest when the first Boeing 707 was delivered to a U.S. airline in 1958 was made possible by the military-funded development of other Boeing jet aircraft for the Defense Department.\nSupport continues\nLast month I detailed how mandatory ticket taxes and fees support commercial aviation. But government funding of the airlines also continues in myriad ways.\nUSA TODAY\nHow much tax do you pay for a plane ticket?\nConsider the Essential Air Service program, which currently provides subsidies for airlines serving 163 rural communities nationwide. There’s also the Fly America Act , which since 1974 has required federal agencies to use U.S. air carriers to transport passengers and cargo when such travel is funded by the government.\nAnd then there’s the bailout many have forgotten. In the aftermath of 9/11 and the grounding of commercial aircraft, Congress and President Bush put forth the Air Transportation Safety and Stabilization Act . Washington so quickly assisted the airlines that virtually nothing was asked in return, not even the quid pro quo of implementing the many passenger rights proposals put forth during that time.\nThe announcement earlier this summer that New York City’s LaGuardia Airport will undergo a major overhaul underscores how a “public-private partnership” to enhance airline infrastructure often involves funds from government agencies. For LaGuardia, New York Governor Cuomo said the $4 billion required for Phase I will be split among public and private entities. To be clear, I support such investment, just as I’ve also supported public investment in highways and rail. But while airlines demand “free markets,” they simultaneously have no trouble accepting government booty.\nUSA TODAY\nNew York reveals $4 billion plan for a new LaGuardia airport\nLaGuardia is no fluke. Throughout the country, taxpayers have supported billions in airline infrastructure over decades. In my book Attention All Passengers , I detail just one aspect, state-of-the-art aircraft maintenance facilities built for U.S. airlines and partially funded by local citizens. Consider that Indianapolis provided almost $300 million in public assistance to a United Airlines repair shop, for a promise of thousands of jobs; subsequently the bulk of such work was outsourced, much of it overseas.\nFinally, there’s the most lucrative of all government handouts: business grants and tax credits. What airline has said no to them?\nPowerful friends\nNot all the aid the industry receives is monetary. Consider that antitrust immunity — which benefits consumers — repeatedly has been waived by the DOT, allowing some U.S. airlines to coordinate schedules and prices. Here are other key ways government provides critical assistance to airlines, sometimes at the expense of passengers:\n• Chapter 11 protection. Bankruptcy reorganization laws afford U.S. carriers advantages many foreign airlines don’t enjoy, particularly when Chapter 11 is used to dismiss debts and freeze wages. American, Delta and United — and most of the carriers they merged with recently — have all filed for bankruptcy.\n• Federal preemption. Many passengers don’t realize their basic right to seek redress through state and local courts doesn’t apply against airlines due to federal preemption; only U.S. courts oversee airlines. As the American Bar Association noted : “Practically all state consumer protection statutes and tort claims are rendered useless against air carriers.”\n• Consolidation. As someone who testified in Congress against recent airline mergers, I can confirm the industry has been repeatedly blessed by the Departments of Justice and Transportation — so much so DOJ is now investigating potential collusion and harm to consumers.\n• Airport slots/rules. For years the DOT has regulated access to congested airports in cities such as Chicago, New York and Washington, and the de facto result is these rules often benefit legacy airlines instead of low-fare carriers and consumers. Additionally, some U.S. airports have had “perimeter rules” that artificially restrict competition at facilities such as Dallas Love Field and New York LaGuardia.\n• Labor negotiations. As I noted last month, in some countries airlines contend with crippling strikes, while U.S. carriers have been well served by the National Mediation Board ; the last major domestic walk-out occurred in 2005.\nUSA TODAY\nWhat if a strike cancels your European flight?\nThis all adds up to tremendous support from federal and local authorities to support the U.S. airline industry. As taxpayers, Americans may not “own” their carriers. But we all have a sizeable financial stake in them.\nMORE: Read previous columns\nBill McGee, a contributing editor to Consumer Reports and the former editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, is an FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher who worked in airline operations and management for several years.
