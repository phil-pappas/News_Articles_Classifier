Make it awesome! Add a Grand Canyon heli tour to your list of activities. Read through this article and learn how to get discounted rates on these amazing trips! \nThere's no better place than Las Vegas to set off on a Grand Canyon helicopter tour. The holiday weekend is the last long weekend of the year and one of the last big holidays before Christmas. Make it special with an air tour. West Rim ToursVegas is in close proximity to the West Rim, being no more than 125 miles from the National Park. The Las Vegas helicopters fly over Hoover Dam and Lake Mead on the way to the canyon, in all, it takes about 45 minutes to get there. The West Rim is unique because it offers both landing, and air only tours. The air-only tours offer beautiful aerial vistas of the canyon, and the good thing is they are less expensive than the landing tours. However, the landing tours come with a flyover too, plus some fun adventures after you land on top of the rim or on the canyon floor. The one that I always recommend is the bottom landing, champagne picnic tour. The descent into the canyon is exhilarating, and you'll get a unique view of the massive rock walls. You could even supplement this with a riverboat ride on the Colorado River, or for the full experience, add in a top landing, and take a walk on the transparent Skywalk that is suspended thousands of feet above the canyon below. The Advantages Of A Deluxe Air TourWhen you buy your tour, you should do it online to get the lowest price, and when you do, you'll get to choose a basic or deluxe tour. Basic tours are fine, but they fly on older style helicopters. The deluxe tours are more comfortable, so you should try to book one for your Labor Day excursion. The deluxe tours use newer EcoStar 130 aircraft. This high performance machine has bigger viewing windows, a 180 degree panoramic windshield, a larger cabin, and a seating plan that has been designed to provide unobstructed views to everyone on board. The deluxe tours also come with free pick up service at your hotel in a limousine to the helipad, which is conveniently located on the Vegas Strip. The deluxe tours cost a little more, but the perks are worth it. Buy Your Tour OnlineThe 2015 Labor Day weekend is nearly here, so don't delay buying your tour, since the Las Vegas flights are so popular. This will ensure that you get to fly on the day you want, at the time you want. It also costs less to buy your tour online since you can bypass fees added on by a travel agent. Pay with your credit card online to confirm your order, and then all you will need to do is prepare for the day. To ConcludeIf you want to make your Labor Day special, then do so with a Grand Canyon helicopter tour. Book today, and book online, because reservations are selling out fast. You can choose an air-only tour or a landing tour, and add on the options of your choice to create the perfect way to experience one of America's most unusual and beautiful landmarks.
