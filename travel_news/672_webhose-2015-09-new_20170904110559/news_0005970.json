Small tax hikes will come into effect on six islands traditionally popular with tourists – Mykonos , Naxos, Paros and Santorini in the Cyclades archipelago, plus the little Aegean outcrop of Skiathos, and the Dodecanese giant Rhodes . This Thursday (October1) will see the islands lose a range of VAT subsidies that have allowed them to reduce prices on items that are crucial to the tourist industry. Three different tax rates – five per cent, nine per cent and 16 per cent – will be adjusted, becoming six per cent, 13 per cent and 23 per cent respectively.

The subsidies have been nullified because the Greek tourist industry has proved itself durable in the face of the monetary storm that has engulfed the country in the last two years. Their removal will mean that tourists have to pay more for hotel and villa accommodation, as well as everyday matters such as lunch and dinner in cafes and restaurants, and drinks in local bars.

Earlier adjustments were made in July. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras promised “the streamlining of the VAT system.” However, the Greek islands were spared the changes until the autumn. Mykonos, Naxos, Paros, Santorini, Skiathos and Rhodes are the first destinations to be affected. Changes to VAT rates on other islands will be staggered, with some set to keep their subsidies until June of next year, and others likely to cling on to them until 2017. Tourism authorities in Greece say that the impact on tourists will be minimal – and that they do not anticipate a drop in visitor numbers as a result. “Greece is a very good value destination, offering the highest quality of tourism services to its visitors, who have ranked the country as one of the best destinations worldwide,” says Christina Kalogera, of the Greek National Tourism Organisation for UK & Ireland. “We anticipate that this will still be the case after the change in VAT.” Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:12:32.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
