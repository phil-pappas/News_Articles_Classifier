Sabre is utilizing the standard Cuba travel certification form for passengers developed by the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA).\nBuilt on Sabre’s industry leading agency workspace, and powered by API technology, the Cuba Traveler Certification capability automatically alerts agents when they have booked an itinerary with air travel to Cuba in order to access the required certification form, transmit the needed data to the transporting airlines, and email the certification form to customers for their records—all in a few easy clicks.\n“Sabre is leading by launching a capability that delivers personalized traveler information, and assists agents by improving their workflow when booking travel to Cuba for consumers in the world’s major outbound market for travel to the island,” said Wade Jones, senior vice president of marketing for Sabre Travel Network.\n“We are also pleased to work with ASTA on launching this capability, and thank them for their support in delivering an industry first automated process that helps agents to drive more sales,” said Jones.\nToday, Sabre-connected agents in the U.S. mainland and territories can shop and book for flights to Cuba without requiring any additional contract amendments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T02:04:27.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
