'She told me that if I ever wanted to build my own house in London, I would have to go out and buy a property with a large garden, resell the house, and keep part of the plot to build on,’ Saunt recalls. 'Jo had done exactly that herself.’ These words stuck with Saunt, and in 2007 she and her husband, David Hills – a fellow architect with whom she founded the practice DSDHA – set about identifying properties with generous plots in their local area of Clapham, south-west London. 'I wrote to five homeowners, and I will never forget the day one of them called me back,’ she says. The glass cupboards in the dining space were made by Creative Metalwork and allow light to pass between the living area and stairwell Photo: Rachael Smith The couple had found a Victorian farmhouse with an overgrown piece of land squeezed between the back gardens of two rows of terraced houses. Once they had sold the farmhouse to friends, Saunt and Hills were left with a site measuring approximately 40 x 65ft – and guarded by fierce conservation-area restrictions. 'It took two applications and an appeal to achieve permission. It was a wearying three years,’ Saunt says. Are prefab boxes the answer to Britain's severe housing shortage? The blueprint for Covert House – aptly named as it is hidden from the street – was in many ways dictated by the strict stipulations of the local authority: the building could not exceed a single storey in height, and it had to be rendered to match the neighbouring house. Restrictions around the border of the plot meant that the structure could be no larger than a garden pavilion, so in order to create a home for four (the couple have two children, Stella, 15, and Isaac, 11), part of the house had to be sunk beneath the ground. An inbuilt planter provides a leafy vista from the lower level Photo: Rachael Smith The resulting 1,615sq ft home has an inverted layout, with the slightly raised ground floor comprising a small hallway and an open-plan living space. More California than Clapham, the room is flooded with light from skylights and glazed sliding doors leading to a south-facing terrace. Down an elegant white concrete staircase is the partially subterranean lower floor, where three bedrooms and a bathroom lead off from a family space. The structure is made of cast concrete, which informs the palette of concrete-grey and white that runs through the house. 'We wanted to use as few elements as possible,’ Saunt explains, adding, 'The design was underscored by sustainability, so we asked ourselves some essential questions, such as, “Is it necessary to plaster or paint a wall?” ’ The couple have embraced the imperfections of the material. Saunt recounts an incident in which the concrete began to dry out between pours because the next batch was held up in traffic. 'The team was furiously vibrating it to keep it liquid and we told them it was fine – we wanted it to say, “Made in Clapham.”’ Deborah Suant and David Hills Photo: Rachael Smith Saunt and Hills have gone to great lengths to mitigate any sense of being underground on the lower level, incorporating two courtyards that serve as light wells. The south-facing courtyard has an inbuilt planter, which ensures that greenery is always within sight. 'We were very conscious of the idea of connecting the house with nature,’ Saunt says. 'What we couldn’t have imagined is the amount of peace and birdsong we would have.’ The invisible £4.5m home: underground Hampstead Heath house up for sale As befits a house with modernist credentials, much of the furniture dates from the mid-20th century and forms a collection the couple has amassed over 20 years. 'Rather incongruously, our previous Victorian house was full of these pieces, although one friend didn’t even recognise the shelving unit when we moved it here,’ Saunt says. An inner courtyard helps to bring light into the family area in the lower level of the house Photo: Rachael Smith The secret to the clutter-free feel of the interior is clever storage, which includes reeded glass cupboards in the dining area that hide essential kitchenware yet have the effect of a beautiful vitrine. Downstairs, a bank of cupboards conceals doors to the master bedroom and the family bathroom. 'Too many architects exist in a purely abstract world, while we believe you can have extraordinary beauty without losing everyday practicality,’ says Saunt, whose practice has designed studios for the jeweller Alex Monroe and the ceramicist Edmund de Waal, and undertaken bigger projects such as the redesign of a swathe of the West End. The master bedroom. The concrete structure of the house provides excellent insulation, so it requires very little heating Photo: Rachael Smith As well as being a family home, Covert House is a manifesto for DSDHA, and Saunt is prepared to go further than that. 'We should be unlocking more backland sites to address the housing crisis,’ she says. 'This is our clarion call to government – they need to let people build low, unobtrusive houses in back gardens around the country.’ telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T00:44:42.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
