There will be live music, including traditional Japanese entertainment, as well as comedy, wine tasting and much more. You can meet premier winter sports regions of Niigata, Nagano, Hokkaido and Tohoku who will offer you with rich tips to plan a perfect tour.\nJapanese Alps ski experience at Nagano & Niigata\nNestled in the Japanese Alps, Nagano and Niigata prefectures are home to some of the best ski and snowboard resorts in Japan. In Nagano you’ll find Hakuba, host of the 1998 Winter Olympics, with more varied slopes and terrain than anywhere else in Japan. Nagano is also home to Shiga Kogen and the 200 wild monkeys who relax serenely there in the hot springs. Or in nearby Niigata, visit Myoko Kogen, one of the world’s oldest ski areas, or the Tokamachi Snow Festival with its skilfully carved snow sculptures and riveting firework displays.

Hokkaido is Hokkaido Snow Festival known for having some of the world’s best powder snow, as cold Siberian winds crossing the Sea of Japan pick up moisture, which then falls as fluffy, dry powder across the whole of Japan’s northern island. Explore Niseko is the main independent information and booking centre in Niseko, Hokkaido. Niseko is celebrated for its spectacular backcountry and for being one of the top 5 resorts for ski and snowboard fans in Japan.

Appi resort, nestled in Hachimantai National Park, is considered Japan’s own version of Aspen. Stunning views across Mount Iwate and Mount Hachimantai provide a dramatic backdrop to an adventurous day of skiing on one of Appi’s 21 slopes. These long, carefully groomed slopes, which stretch for lengths of up to 3.5 miles, also offer fantastic powder riding opportunities. Due to the size of this resort and the long season (which runs from early December right through until May), it’s an ideal place for winter sports fans who enjoy the peace of uncrowded slopes. Representatives from Iwate Hotel and Resort will be at the Japan stand throughout the Ski and Snowboard Show.\nTailor-made trips by JTB\nJTB Europe is a Japan specialist travel agent and tour operator.
