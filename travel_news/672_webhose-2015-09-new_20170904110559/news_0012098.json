The main building will be demolished in October, with the annex remaining open to make way for the new hotel’s 510 guestrooms. \nThe new hotel will be 41 stories tall and will be open by 2019, in time for Tokyo to host the 2020 Olympic Games. \nGiven Hotel Okura’s past, there has been significant controversy, with many opponents expressing the plans to demolish the landmark as “destruction of culture.” In addition to hosting delegates and celebrities from around the world, the hotel was also featured in the James Bond film “You Only Live Twice.” \nLuxury brands have put forth a number of efforts to preserve historical landmarks. \nFor example, Italian fashion houses Prada and Versace helped to bring the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan to an online audience with the curation of a digital project. The InGalleria Web site, launched Dec. 7, lets consumers click through photos of the restoration process of the monument, as well as read up on its history and view a digital guestbook with visitors’ content. The site works as a digital museum for the building, as well as letting Prada and Versace delve into their Milanese heritages ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T11:31:12.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
