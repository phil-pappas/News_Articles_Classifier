For those applying to Oxford or Cambridge, the deadline comes sooner – October 15 – so applications should, by now, be well under way. The same applies to anyone looking to study medicine. • Use the Telegraph's University Course Finder to find a degree • How to write a good personal statement for university For everyone else, the January deadline can make it seem like you have ample time to get everything together – but months pass quickly when you also have exams to think about, so the sooner you get all the components of your application in place, the sooner you'll be able to concentrate on the important task of getting the grades required. Keep these dates in mind, and you'll avoid any last minute panic. If you still need to apply for 2015 entry September 21 – Final deadlines for applications If you haven’t submitted a Ucas application to start studying in 2015, today will be your last day to be entered into Clearing this year. Applications need to be in by 6pm (UK time) so don’t forget to get those last minute details finalised before the deadline passes September 30 – Clearing vacancy search closes Deadlines really are coming thick and fast now. Today will be your last opportunity to search for Clearing vacancies using Ucas. After today, you will still be able to apply through Clearing, but you will have to contact the universities themselves if you want to discuss availability. October 21 – Clearing closes Today is your final opportunity to apply through Clearing, and universities will have until today to make their decision whether to accept you or not. It’s important to bear in mind at this point that the majority of university degree courses will have started, so you will have a lot to organise and some catching up to do if you decide to proceed with your application. If you are applying for university in 2016 October 15 – Deadline for Oxford, Cambridge and medicine The first deadline to keep in mind. For those looking to apply to Oxbridge, medicine, dentistry and veterinary science courses, applications need to be completed and submitted via Ucas by 6pm (GMT). This means ALL aspects of your application – including your reference from teachers. So if you haven't asked yet, you'd better put on your nicest smile. January 15, 2016 – Deadline for most undergraduate courses If you spent Christmas making some final tweaks to your application or personal statement, today is the day you have to submit the final product to Ucas. This should be done by 6pm (GMT) if you want to make sure your application is given equal consideration by universities. February 25 – Ucas Extra opens If you applied to the January 15 deadline, used all your five options, but don't hold any offers, Ucas Extra could be for you. Ucas Extra gives candidates who haven't secured a place a chance to add another option to their application. Bear in mind, you can only add one extra option at a time and the system will close on July 4. May to July – Deadlines for replying to university offers May 4 : If you receive all university decisions by March 31, who must reply by May 4 or they will be rejected for you. June 8 : If you receive all decisions by May 5, you must reply by June 8 June 23 : If you receive all decisions by June 8, you must reply by June 23 July 22 : If you receive all decisions by July 14, you must reply by July 22 May 5 -University deadline to reply to your application If you applied to the January 15 deadline, universities have until today to reply to you. If you do not hear back from them about your application by the end of the day, Ucas will decline the application on their behalf. June 30 – Last day you can apply to university for 2016 entry If you submit your first application (ie not Ucas Extra) to Ucas by 6pm (GMT) they will forward your application on to your chosen universities – bear in mind that it may not receive equal consideration as those submitted to the January 15 deadline. Any applications received after this point, will be entered into Clearing 2016.
