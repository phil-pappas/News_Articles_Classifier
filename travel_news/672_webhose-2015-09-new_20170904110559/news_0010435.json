Picture: MARTIN RHODES Related articles COMPANY COMMENT: Imperial; Super Group Imperial stays in the hunt for new deals Acquisitions lift Imperial’s profits Imperial ambitions have pushed Europe to its limits In this article JSE-listed companies: Imperial IMPERIAL Holdings had accepted an offer from the Hollard Insurance Group and the Yellowwoods Group — the umbrella holding company of Hollard — to buy 100% of insurers Regent Group, Regent Botswana and Regent Lesotho for R2.3bn, the company said on Tuesday.\nThe logistics, vehicle dealerships and industrial trucking group said the disposal of Regent was in line with its strategy of focusing on core capabilities and divesting companies without strategic, competitive or financial advantage.\n\"The proceeds from the proposed transaction will be used to reduce debt and to support the group’s diversification strategy,\" Imperial CEO Mark Lamberti said.\nThe group is also engaged in vehicle import, rentals and after-market parts; and vehicle-related financial services.\nThe Regent business comprises long-and short-term insurance licences in SA, Botswana and Lesotho. It covers motor-related insurance and nonmotor business.\n\"While the business of Regent has grown strongly since its establishment, a large fast-growing portion of Regent’s revenue and profits are unrelated to (Imperial’s) core vehicle and logistics businesses and enjoy no strategic, competitive or financial advantage from Imperial’s ownership,\" the group said.\nSubsequent to the implementation of the proposed transaction, some of the Regent group’s motor-related businesses will be sold by Hollard to the FirstRand/ Hollard insurance joint venture. The effective date of the proposed transaction will be on the fulfilment of conditions precedent. The share increased 1.04% to R171.77 at the JSE close on Tuesday.\nImperial employs more than 57,000 people and generates annual revenues that exceed R110bn. The company operates in 31 countries.\n\"The growth prospects and value of these unrelated businesses will be better advanced by owners with established capability and scale in financial services and insurance,\" Mr Lamberti said. The buyout will be settled in cash upon fulfilment of the conditions precedent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:00:18.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
