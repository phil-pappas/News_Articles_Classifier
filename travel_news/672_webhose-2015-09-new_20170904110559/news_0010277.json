French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told MPs in Paris that the strikes did not target IS.\nSecurity sources said Russian fighter jets hit positions in Hama, Homs and Latakia provinces. Earlier Syrian state television said unmanned drones had flown over the areas before the strikes.\nA rebel group supported by Western opponents said eight of its fighters were injured in the Hama province strikes. Their commander, Maj Jamil al-Saleh, who defected from the Syrian army in 2012, said northern Hama had no presence of IS.\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday held talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, who later called for co-ordination in the fight against IS and presented a resolution at a United Nations (UN) Security Council meeting in New York. Mr Lavrov called for the world to create a \"strong bulwark\" against IS.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin had won unanimous approval from legislators in the Duma to use Russian armed forces in Syria, Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov said Wednesday. Russian, Iraqi and Syrian officials agreed at the weekend to share intelligence on Syria. The agreement excluded the US, causing some friction. On Monday, Mr Putin told the UN he supported a parallel political transition in Syria.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor, reported at least 27 civilians had been killed in the air strikes in Homs province.\nControl of Homs is mostly divided between Syria’s regime and IS, which holds the ancient city of Palmyra and much of the area east of it. The areas that took the brunt of the strikes were mostly controlled by Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front, while those hit in Latakia are held by a coalition known as the Army of Conquest, which includes Al-Nusra.\nThe areas targeted in Hama include places controlled mostly by IS and moderate rebel groups, as well as those held by Al-Nusra and groups that have pledged allegiance to IS.\nSo far, Russia has sent at least 500 troops as well as 28 fighter jets and several bombers and artillery units to Latakia military base, US officials say.\nUS Defence Secretary Ash Carter on Tuesday instructed his staff to open lines of communication with Russia to avoid any clashes between US-led coalition planes and Russian aircraft.\nRussia would do better to join the existing US-led coalition bombing IS in Iraq and Syria than start a second coalition in support of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad,Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told CBS news. Saudi Arabia supports a political transition away from the Syrian leader, though that could take \"a long time\",he said.\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said anyone who provided arms to either side in Syria were \"only contributing to further misery — and the risk of unintended consequences.\"\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron said his country would look very carefully at the Russian actions, and that if they were part of the international coalition fighting IS, \"then that is all to the good\".\n\"If, on the other hand, this is action against the Free Syrian Army in support of Assad the dictator, then obviously that is a retrograde step,\" Mr Cameron told reporters during a visit to Jamaica on Wednesday. \"But let us see exactly what has happened.\"\nThe head of Syria’s main Western-backed opposition, Khaled Khoja, president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, called Russia’s military involvement in the conflict an \"invasion\" and said in an interview with MSNBC Wednesday it will \"demolish\" talks on a political resolution.\nAFP, Reuters and Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:53:10.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
