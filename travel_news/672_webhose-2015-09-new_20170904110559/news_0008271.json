The event, which attracts airline and travel industry CEOs from across the Americas region, Asia and EMEA, is a key forum for high-level debate and discussion of the strategic issues facing the region’s aviation industry.\n“Las Vegas is honored to once again host the CAPA Americas Aviation Summit” said Cathy Tull, Senior Vice President of Marketing for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA). “As the entertainment and convention capital of the world and an emerging international business center, Las Vegas offers a truly unique experience to the world’s aviation leaders. From our $2.4 billion state-of-the-art international Terminal 3 to our ability to continually reinvent Las Vegas as an international tourism destination, Las Vegas is the perfect stage for industry leaders to connect and gain key insight into what the future of travel and tourism holds.”\n“We are delighted to announce that Las Vegas will be our host city for the second annual CAPA Americas Aviation Summit in 2016. Our international guests and local delegates will be exposed to the tremendous business, travel and tourism opportunities that exist in Las Vegas and our hosts will have the opportunity to showcase the unprecedented investment in facilities and services that is occurring in the destination and surrounding region”, said CAPA Executive Chairman, Peter Harbison.\nNamed as North America’s leading meeting and convention destination for 21 consecutive years, Las Vegas hosts more of the leading conventions than any other destination in the United States. Hosting more than 22,000 conventions, events and conferences a year and welcoming nearly 5.2 million convention attendees in 2014, Las Vegas is the ideal destination for the CAPA Americas Aviation Summit 2016.\n“The return of the CAPA Americas Aviation Summit is significant to each of us at McCarran International Airport, as well as the community it serves,” said Director of Aviation Rosemary Vassiliadis. “The caliber of attendees and breadth of aviation-industry topics that were addressed at this year’s event were outstanding, and I look forward to interacting with other aviation leaders and experts from around the world when CAPA returns to Las Vegas next spring.”\nThe Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority works to attract visitors to the city by promoting Las Vegas as the world’s most desirable destination for leisure and business travel. Tourism is the city’s number one industry and more than half of those visitors arrive in Las Vegas by air. With more than 900 inbound and outbound flights per day and nonstop services from 135 US and international cities, McCarran International Airport acts as an important gateway for nearly half of Southern Nevada’s approximately 41 million annual visitors.\nKnown globally for its unparalleled mix of world-class resorts, entertainment offerings and nearby stunning natural attractions, Las Vegas is a fascinating city that also means business when it comes to conventions and events. Las Vegas looks forward to showcasing the myriad of experiences that make it a unique leisure and business destination, while expanding its current air services even further.\nSource: LVCVA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:54:30.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
