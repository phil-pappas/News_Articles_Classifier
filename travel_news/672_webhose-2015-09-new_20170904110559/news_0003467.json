This should not be a tough sell since Kelly has been documenting his voyage on social media, sharing images of the Earth from his unique vantage point and has posted about the beauty of The Bahamas on several occasions. It is with that in mind that officials are inviting the astronaut and his family to enjoy a visit The Bahamas upon completion of his year-long mission orbiting the Earth. \nHis most recent images of The Bahamas from space came on September 18 and 19 when he posted, “The Bahamas never fails to impress!” and “Been hanging out with The Bahamas again, it never gets old.” His comments were part of an hour-long session where Kelly answered questions from the Twittersphere about his first 6 months in space. He has 421,000 active Twitter followers, so launching the chat with an image of The Bahamas means hundreds of thousands persons saw this photo. The Tweet has already been retweeted 974 times and favorited 2,500 times. \nKelly’s previous tweets about The Bahamas were equally flattering. On April 26, the American astronaut showed his daughter “the most beautiful place from space” when he tweeted an image of The Bahamas. On July 19, he posted another stunning image of the archipelago with the comment, “Bahamas, the strokes of your watercolors are always a refreshing sight.” \n“This is amazing organic marketing for us. Here is this astronaut, who the whole world is watching because he is making history, talking about how beautiful our country is. We must bring Scott Kelly here to The Bahamas, not only to thank him, but also to show him the country that is bringing him so much joy while he is in space,” says Director General of the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism Joy Jibrilu. \nIf Kelly stays until March 3, 2016, Kelly’s 342-day visit will be the longest consecutive stay in orbit by a NASA astronaut. “After such a mission, who wouldn’t want to relax on our beautiful beaches? I think he has earned himself a much-needed vacation to The Bahamas. We would be more than happy to host him and his family,” Ms. Jibrilu said. \nThe Islands Of The Bahamas have a place in the sun for everyone from Nassau and Paradise Island to Grand Bahama to The Abaco Islands, The Exuma Islands, Harbour Island, Long Island and others. Each island has its own personality and attractions for a variety of vacation styles with some of the world’s best scuba diving, fishing, sailing, boating, as well as, shopping and dining. The destination offers an easily accessible tropical getaway and provides convenience for travelers with preclearance through U.S. customs and immigration, and the Bahamian dollar is on par with the U.S. dollar. Do everything or do nothing, just remember It’s Better in The Bahamas.
