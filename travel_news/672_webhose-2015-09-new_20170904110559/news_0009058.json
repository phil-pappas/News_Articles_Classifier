Four Seasons’ location-specific initiatives are a favored way for the brand both to show off its knowledge and place within specific locales and provide consumers with memorable experiences. “Nevis is the only Caribbean destination where couples can find a Four Seasons and the extraordinary service, creative and top-quality dining experiences, and exceptionally designed accommodations that our brand is known for,” said Harrison Liu, director of public relations at Four Seasons Resort Nevis. “These new packages are ideal for couples looking to incorporate the best of the Caribbean in their wedding or vow renewal. We’re far from your cookie-cutter resort and nearly all of our friendly, engaging and skillful staff are Nevisian, so couples are getting authentic Caribbean luxury when they commemorate their special day with us. \nSomething new The first of the packages, “Quintessential Nevis,” allows couples to say “I do” in the Nevisian greenery, Pinney’s Beach or against the hotel’s sugar mill backdrop. \nRegardless of which choice is made, the wedding will feature an hour of a local guitarist or keyboardist, cooking, spa treatments, a specialty cocktail and customized wedding favors. The next day, a chef will help the newlyweds pick out their favorite local ingredients from the hotel’s herb garden and give them a cooking lesson in their private beach cabana. \nCouple getting married at Four Seasons Nevis \nThe “Nevis Vista Villa” trades the outdoors for a two-floor modern villa, complete with local entertainment and a private beach cabana just like the “Quintessential Nevis,” but with breakfast in bed instead of a cooking lesson. The “Nevis Vista Villa” also allows up to six additional guest rooms for family and friends of the newlyweds. \n“Happily Ever After” offers the bride a hair salon appointment, makeup trial/wedding day application and an hour-long mani/pedi, as well as a couple’s massage. The couple then gets to choose from a selection of restaurants for a dinner for two and get treated to breakfast in bed the next day. \nA couple enjoys the sunset and food at Four Seasons Nevis \nLastly, “Come Away With Me” offers customization over wedding location and entertainment by providing the couple with a personal wedding specialist. The next day, their private cabana will have a butler, Champagne and hand and foot reflexology. \nThe varying packages are tailored to weddings of different sizes and offer differences in location, entertainment or food to ensure that every couple can be treated to the wedding of their dreams without compromise. Providing options for its patrons also reinforces the brand’s commitment to putting consumers first by providing patrons with memorable luxurious experiences. \nNewlyweds will enjoy a private beach cabana \nWinning over consumers on wedding day may be an especially effective way of creating loyal and lifelong consumers. \n“ Four Seasons Resort Nevis offers couples a variety of different settings for the most perfect backdrop to exchange vows,” Mr. Liu said. “What doesn’t change is the top service, attention to detail and quality. Our personal wedding specialists work with each couple to cater to their budgets, party size and interests, to ensure a that the day unfolds flawlessly.” \nTake a vow Perhaps because of the relative effectiveness of weddings, other hotel brands have also created nuptial-centered initiatives. \nFor example, Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts is highlighting the weddings held at its properties through a collaboration with bridal blog, Style Me Pretty. \nShared by Waldorf Astoria’s main social channels, the sponsored post explains that Style Me Pretty’s post includes the ballrooms of a number of its hotels including its New York flagship. By presenting images of past weddings planned at its properties, Waldorf Astoria may see a spike in bookings among readers of Style Me Pretty ( see story ). \nOther luxury sectors have also made a push for wedding-day inclusion. \nFootwear and accessories label Jimmy Choo joined the wedding season with a promotion of its branded hashtag for Instagram. \nThese “I do in Choo” moments allow the brand to aggregate the special moments from loyal consumers. The repeat use of a catchy hashtag likely added more attention to the campaign, especially as wedding season picked up in the spring ( see story ). “Weddings and vow renewals are an important part of our business and is a natural extension of the Four Seasons Resort Nevis experience,” said Mr. Liu. “Travelers love vacationing with us for other occasions and our extraordinary hospitality and expertise is what couples want in one of the most memorable days in their lives.” \nFinal Take Forrest Cardamenis, editorial assistant on Luxury Daily, New York", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:32:58.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
