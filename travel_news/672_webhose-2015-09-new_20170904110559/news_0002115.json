Up to 35% off. Las Vegas and South Rim tours. Book early. Seats limited. LAS VEGAS, NV, September 22,   Grand Canyon Tours is celebrating the end of a long, hot summer by marking down select helicopter and airplane sightseeing flight tours for the month of September 2015. Las Vegas The Vegas helicopter tour that's marked down is the air-only tour that departs Boulder City, a nearby suburb of Las Vegas that's requires a 30-minute mini-van shuttle ride (included in the price of the tour). Like all Vegas flights, it goes over Lake Mead, Hoover Dam, the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon. Once in National Park airspace, the chopper turns back for Las Vegas. There is a deluxe version of this tour and it's highly recommended. It departs from the Las Vegas Strip and includes an extended sightseeing tour over the Las Vegas Strip. In addition, this tour uses the EcoStar 130, which is 25 percent larger than a conventional helicopter and boasts stadium-style seats and a 180-degree wraparound windshield for panoramic views. For travelers who have the budget, it's recommended that a landing tour be booked. These flights go to the top or bottom of the Canyon. The most popular lands at the base for a Champagne picnic, and it can be extended to include a Colorado River boat ride and tickets to the Grand Canyon Skywalk. The Plane The Vegas air-only airplane tour is this summer's special and it does everything the helicopter does except at a higher altitude. Further, airplanes can hold up to 19 people (helicopters hold up to 6 people). Thus if the helicopter is sold out, always consider the airplane as there are usually seats available. South Rim Helicopter The summer South Rim chopper promotion is the basic 30-minute flight that goes from the South Rim to the North Rim and back. As in Vegas, there's a deluxe version of this as well that uses the superior EcoStar helicopter. If one has the budget, it's recommended that one consider the 50-minute chopper ride as it does everything the 30-minute tour does including flying to the Park's eastern border before an extended North Rim flyover. Upon completion, travelers will have seen up to 75 percent of the Park. Even though it's not marked down, travelers should give thought to the helicopter/Jeep combo package. This super popular package combines the 30-minute helicopter ride with a professionally guided Jeep tour that lets you see all the Park's key landmarks and lookouts. The South Rim airplane special is the 50-minute tour that follows the same route as the longer helicopter tour except at a higher altitude. From a price point, this trip's a great deal, especially for groups because planes can carry more people. RSVP It's still very busy at the Canyon and so it's recommended that travelers book their sightseeing flight at least a week in advance. Avoid same-day bookings as prices will be higher on the flights that aren't sold out. Book these tours on the Internet in order to get the best price. The reason for this is that tour operators are giving travelers big discounts for \"self-serve\" bookings so make sure to take advantage of this. Remember, however, to complete the booking online in order to qualify for the special Internet rate.
