Alexander Katzung, Innovation manager Airbus Corporate Innovation, will lead the accelerator in Hamburg. In parallel Airbus has opened a second round of applications for start-ups seeking support.\nThe Airbus BizLab welcomes applications for acceleration programmes in Hamburg from start-ups. A screening committee, which includes Airbus’s Chief Innovation Officer, Yann Barbaux, and the Head of the Airbus BizLabs, Bruno Gutierres, selects the most promising ideas.\nAirbus launched its global aerospace business accelerator in Toulouse in March 2015 as part of its innovation strategy to bring together start-ups and Airbus “intrapreneurs” (internal entrepreneurs) to work and speed up the transformation of their innovative ideas into valuable businesses. Airbus aims to accelerate the pace at which it can commercialise innovative ideas drawn from within Airbus and outside, including from customers and other external partners.\nThe global BizLab network will also include India and other key markets.\nAirbus offers early-stage projects wide-ranging support, in the form of a six-month “acceleration programme”. Through these programmes, Airbus BizLab gives access to a large number of coaches, experts and mentors in various domains: technology, legal, finance, marketing & communication; easing prototyping and access to market.\nAirbus is a leading aircraft manufacturer with the most modern and comprehensive family of airliners on the market, ranging in capacity from 100 to more than 500 seats. Airbus champions innovative technologies and offers some of the world’s most fuel efficient and quiet aircraft. Airbus has sold some 16,000 aircraft to more than 370 customers worldwide. Airbus has achieved almost 9,300 deliveries since the first Airbus aircraft entered into service.
