(Photo: File / Larry McCormack / The Tennessean) 61 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nA suspicious package flagged by a canine snarled traffic and delayed flights at Nashville International Airport on Sunday, airport officials said. \nThe bag — which an airline employee first spotted at about 10:15 a.m. — turned out to be empty. \nAn airport official said the airline employee saw that the bag had apparently been left unattended in one of the displays meant to help gauge whether a piece of luggage will fit in an overhead bin. \nWhen airport police brought in a canine unit, the dog sat down, indicating a \"positive response,\" said Tom Jurkovich, vice president of strategic communications and external affairs for the Nashville Airport Authority. \n\"Security protocol ratchets up further at that point,\" Jurkovich said. \nThe airport police's explosives unit tried to X-ray the bag. When that didn't yield clear enough images, a robot was used to move the bag to an empty parking lot next to the airport. \nThere, Jurkovich explained, a jetstream of water was used to essentially blast the bag open. Through a video camera at first, then outfitted in protective gear, investigators found that the bag was empty. \nMeanwhile, a large portion of the terminal had been evacuated and passengers waited outside. Though about a dozen departures were delayed as a result, no arriving flights were delayed, Jurkovich wrote in an email. \nHe said in an interview that the airport's security team followed safety protocols and said that the airline employee did the right thing by reporting the bag. \n\"We're apologetic to our passengers and customers about any inconvenience, but safety and security is utterly paramount,\" Jurkovich said. \"Our security forces did a fantastic job.\" \nBy about 1:40 p.m., an airport spokesman said that the package had been opened and deemed safe. \nJurkovich said that as of Sunday afternoon, no arrests had been made in connection with the incident, but that an investigation was ongoing. \nReach Jill Cowan at 615-664-2150 and on Twitter @jillcowan .
