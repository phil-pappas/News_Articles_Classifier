Valerie Horton   \nTHE Fraser Coast does not need skyscrapers or waves to lure tourists - the region's increase in international visitors is more than double that of the Gold Coast. \nThe latest tourism figures show a 14.1% increase in international tourists coming to the Fraser Coast, compared to a 6.2% increase on the glitter strip. \nThe increase was second in the state to Townsville at more than double the state's average. For the year ending June 30, the Fraser Coast also beat the Australian average for tourism growth, which was up 6.6%. \nThe positive numbers for the Fraser Coast are driven by increased visits by the German and the United Kingdom market. \nAbout 36,000 people visited the region from the UK, an increase of 13.8% on last year. \nVisits by European tourists rose 15.6% to 68,000 and included an impressive 30.5% rise in German visitors. \nFraser Coast Opportunities board member Greig Bolderrow said the marketing campaign in Europe was paying off. \n\"It's pleasing for the region that market share for both visitation and expenditure is growing against the state and national averages, especially in the UK and European markets which we currently target,\" he said. \nThe tourists are also spending more money with direct expenditure increasing by 21% to $46.8 million. \nTourism portfolio councillor Stuart Taylor said the results were great news for the region. \n\"More international visitors spending more money in our region is an excellent outcome, spreading positive benefits throughout the entire Fraser Coast economy,\" he said. \nDespite domestic tourism data released in March showing interstate visitation to the Fraser Coast had dropped 11.4%, visitor expenditure was up 22% to $335.1 million. \nWHERE They're from \nThere was a 30.5% rise in German visitors \nGreater Europe tourists rose 15.6% to 68,000 fraser coast", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:39:17.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
