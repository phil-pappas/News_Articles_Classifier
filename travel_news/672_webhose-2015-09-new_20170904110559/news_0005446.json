Turkey is such a stunning and interesting country that any holiday you choose will be amazing . However, there are some must-see places in Turkey that are worth popping on your itinerary, as each of these places can be fully enjoyed over a few days. The richly historic culture, stunning architecture , and breathtaking lands (from oceans to mountains) are just a few reason why you would enjoy a trip to Turkey. So, for a truly unforgettable vacation abroad, here are my top destinations to explore while traveling to Turkey. The Turquoise Coast of Antalya At the slopes of the Taurus Mountains you will find the city of Antalya. This vibrant and scenic part of Turkey is a fantastic tourist spot; but that doesn’t mean that it is overrun by visitors, even during the busier summer months, this city still feels distinctly Turkish. Often referred to as ‘ paradise on earth ‘, because of the palm trees, clear blue sea and amazing beaches that you can find, this is a perfect spot for sun worshippers. However, if being a beach bum doesn’t entice you, there are also excellent climbing spots, popular golf courses, skiing on offer and an Archaeological Museum for culture vultures. The Ancient Ruins of Bodrum If you decided to spend the day on the beach in Antalya, you may be up for something a bit different when you get to Bodrum. This town has ruins that date back to 1000BC, and was once the site of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World: the Tomb of King Mausolus. It also has its fair share of beautiful coastline but with so much history to see, you won’t want to spend your day in Bodrum sunbathing. The Whirling Dervishes of Konya This is one of the oldest cities in the world and is famous for the Whirling Dervishes. The religious practice of spinning that these Whirling Dervishes perform can be seen weekly at the Mevlana Cultural Center. It also offers stunning buildings that date back to the 12 th and 13 th centuries such as the Alaeddin Mosque, where the tombs of several sultans can be found. The contrast of these buildings with the modern Seljuk Tower, which is one of the tallest skyscrapers in Turkey, is a great example of the traditional and the contemporary blending seamlessly.

As the counterpoint of where Europe meets Asia, you’re almost always guaranteed to have a unique cultural experience at just about every corner you turn around.

Wherever you go in Turkey you will be met with stunning scenery and a wealth of history that will captivate you. There are so many interesting places to visit that at the end of your long weekend you will be wondering why you aren’t staying longer. What’s your most favorite place to visit in Turkey?
