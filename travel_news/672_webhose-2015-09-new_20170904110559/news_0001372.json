Unfortunately, most of us can't afford the steep price that comes with that privilege. As an aviation journalist, I've been able to try out some of the world's finest airline premium cabin products. Below is my list of six carriers that offer over-the-top amenities for their best customers.\nPhoto courtesy of Singapore Airlines 1. Singapore Airlines - Suites The carrier’s suites are available on the carrier’s fleet of Airbus A380s . Each cabin features sliding doors and window blinds for complete privacy. The suite includes a distinctively designed, stand-alone bed with fine linen and plush, full-sized pillows. Hungry? Use Singapore Airlines’ Book the Cook service, where travelers can pre-order and have specially prepared gourmet meals. After dining, enjoy the airlines’ system that offers audio and video-on-demand via a 23-inch wide LCD screen. There’s also access to multi-ports with power supply and USB ports.
