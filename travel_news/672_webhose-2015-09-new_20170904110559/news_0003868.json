New easyJet flights to Bilbao, Isle of Man, Porto, Gibraltar, Lanzarote, Catania and Zante all commenced earlier this year. Wizz Air also entered the South West market for the first time in June, launching twice weekly flights to Katowice in Poland.\nInbound traffic also received a boost recently with the high profile opening of Banksy’s Dismaland in nearby Weston-super-Mare. This is expected to attract visitors on scheduled services from across the UK and Europe, as well as private charter flights from further afield.\nAn enlarged departure lounge opened in July to help meet this growing demand, and work is already underway on a second major extension to the terminal building which will deliver significant improvements to the security search and arrivals areas next year.\nRobert Sinclair, Chief Executive at Bristol Airport, said:\n“The growing number of passengers choosing Bristol Airport demonstrates the strong demand for air travel to and from the South West and Wales and underlines why we continue to invest in enhancing facilities for passengers. By combining a comprehensive route network with a friendly and efficient airport experience we want to be the number one choice when customers in our region are making their travel plans.”\nProspects remain strong for the rest of the year, with a range of new scheduled routes commencing in the coming months. Wizz Air launches a new service to Kosice in Slovakia in October, and easyJet flights to Vienna and Basle begin in November. The Rugby World Cup in September and October is expected to provide a further boost to inbound passenger numbers this autumn.\n*Due to differences in the way some flights are recorded, Bristol Airport figures may contain small variances when compared to those reported by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).\nSource:- Bristol Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:51:42.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
