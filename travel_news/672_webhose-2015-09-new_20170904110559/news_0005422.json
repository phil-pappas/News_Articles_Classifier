The new cultural diplomacy project explores the idea of beauty in art by comparing two leading cities in this domain: Brussels and Milan. The exhibition centres not only on ambassadors of this practice like Duchamp, who was the first to term any object a work of art by signing his name on it (with one of the best known being ” Fountain “, the upside down porcelain urinal), but also takes an interest in the new generation carrying on this artistic tradition. Among them, the works of today’s big names like Thierry De Cordier, Michel François, or even Angel Vergara, are assembled with those of the young artists from diverse backgrounds working in Brussels.\nThe “Brussels Days” began on Saturday, 19 September with a special edition of the Ommegang parade. This annual event, which immerses Brussels in the atmosphere and scenery of the time of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, sent a special procession all the way to Milan, in order to replay key moments in the history of the Belgian capital for the 200,000 daily visitors to the World’s Fair.\nOn Sunday, projects under the auspices of the Brussels-Capital Region that reflect the theme of Expo Milano 2015 – “Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life” – were presented to an audience of 250 invited guests.\n“Una Grande Abbuffata” (A Huge Feast), an artistic exhibition with chocolate as a theme, was among the projects presented. It consists of a fulsome banquet of traditional craftsmanship, visual arts and technologies. In this project, Gluon explores how the art of hand-made chocolates, a Brussels tradition par excellence, can be completely renewed by the conjunction of other disciplines and technological developments. In collaboration with Callebaut, the chocolate maker, Gluon has set up a laboratory, in which artists and Brussels’ renowned master chocolate makers can experiment, exchange their expertise and create new structures. Experimentation took place throughout the chocolate-making process, from the cocoa bean to chocolate. Belgian chocolate-makers and artists willingly took on the challenges posed by such technological innovations as 3-D printing, in order to express their creative ideas in the form of a large number of chocolate sculptures. On display at the Belgian Pavilion, these sculptures were admired by the 20,000 daily visitors to the Belgian Pavilion.\nThen “Brussels Urban Food 2015“ a call for projects on the theme of sustainable nourishment in Brussels that was launched early this year, presented its three finalists, including the Grand Winner elected “Brussels Urban Food 2025.” The winning project, “La Fourna”, updates the idea of a bakery as a place to meet and exchange, allowing people to not only buy their bread but also to draw up and exchange recipes.\nSunday evening saw a cocktail buffet prepared by two great Brussels chefs, Lionel Rigolet and Giovanni Bruno, before giving way to an evening of “Folie Bourgeoise,” a typically Brussels concept that was open to the general public at the Belgian Pavilion.\nMonday and Tuesday were reserved for professional meetings during which 40 Brussels-based companies in the food, service, architectural, tourism and cultural sectors met with more than 120 Italian enterprises in workshops, exchanges and seminars. Professionals were able to share moments that allowed Milan and Brussels to reinforce their connections and respective competences.\nAll concerned consider that the organisation of “Brussels Days” made it possible to reach a great many people thanks to the large number of Italian visitors to the World’s Fair, as well as to the Belgian Pavilion. There is general recognition and acknowledgement of the excellent collaboration between the different Brussels institutions and the Belgian Pavilion.\nSo, on to 2020 in Dubai for the World’s Fair with the theme “Connecting minds, Creating the future,”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:46:29.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
