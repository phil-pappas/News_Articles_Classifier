An escape for the whole family, it is perfect for creating lifelong memories together, from the magic of a parade to spectacular shows, thrilling rides and the chance to meet favourite characters. And there are also plenty of amazing experiences for grown-ups. You can come back from a Disney holiday feeling relaxed, refreshed and, yes, even a little more youthful. It may be a holiday but with Disney you can always pick up new skills or make interesting discoveries. On the cruise ships, for example, learn how to tell your chablis from your chardonnay at wine-tasting seminars or pick up tips from the chefs on making simple desserts to impress your friends. At Walt Disney World, there is even the opportunity to savour an African safari experience (for an additional cost). Enjoy a privately guided VIP expedition through the savannah to see exotic African wildlife in its native habitat and dine on African-inspired food as you explore. Choosing where to eat is a pleasurable problem whether on dry land or at sea. There is so much dining choice and the quality is exceptional. It is not all character dining, fun though it is. Enjoy a multi-course, wine-paired dinner with a chance to meet the chef While cruising, you can opt for romantic dining in the adults-only French and Italian restaurants, Remy and Palo, which incur a small extra cost. On land at Walt Disney World, there is a wide choice of speciality restaurants and places for a quiet, leisurely meal. At Cítrico’s, in Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa, for example, you can enjoy a multi-course, wine-paired dinner with a chance to meet the chef. For something contemporary but child-free, try The Dining Room at Wolfgang Puck’s at Downtown Disney, where you can sample Asian-Californian fusion food within sight of the open kitchen. The Victoria and Albert offers fine dining in elegant, pillared-and-chandeliered surroundings while the Trattoria al forno at Disney’s BoardWalk is a relaxed eatery celebrating the diversity of Italian cuisine. Boatwright’s Dining Hall offers tasty New Orleans cooking overlooking the Sassagoula River in Downtown Disney. You can embrace the glamour of Tinseltown at The Hollywood Brown Derby for an upmarket American dining experience, or enjoy a soulful Sunday brunch with live music at the House of Blues. Gourmet dining: eat whilst overlooking the Sassagoula River in Downtown Disney Evening entertainment is not just bars and nightclubs (although there are plenty of these, ranging from quiet cocktail spots to karaoke bars). Ooh La La, for example, a pink-and-gilt French boudoir-themed bar on one of the Disney Cruise Ships, the Disney Fantasy, is one of several sophisticated nightspots in the cruise ship’s Europa entertainment district. Alternatively, retreat to Keys, the elegant piano bar, after dinner for a digestif accompanied by live music. By day, the quiet Cove Café is an adults-only coffee shop and lounge, and the perfect spot to settle down with a good book or magazine while sipping speciality teas and coffees. Drop by Disney’s BoardWalk in Walt Disney World Resort, and you can shimmy across the dance floor of the Atlantic Dance Hall’s 1920s-style ballroom. The hottest number on the BoardWalk is Jellyrolls where two piano maestros dazzle with their duelling pianos. Walt Disney World has four golf courses to choose from The big entertainment, whether on land or sea, however, comes in the live shows, which range from Broadway-style extravaganzas starring well-known Disney characters to magic and fireworks shows, and Cirque du Soleil breath-taking acrobatics. It is when you are watching these, gasping at daring leaps and oohing and ahhing over spectacular displays, that you realise big kids are no different from little kids. If you are feeling active, Walt Disney World has four golf courses, including the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa’s championship Magnolia course with its testing water hazards. Dotted around the theme parks are numerous tennis courts and running trails, and a range of fitness centres, some of which are open 24 hours. You do not have to be on land to be active. Combine your Walt Disney World experience with a cruise and, while the children are entertained in the supervised kids clubs, you can work out in the state-of-the-art fitness centre with panoramic ocean views and a daily programme of classes such as yoga and Pilates. The super-keen can even book a personal trainer. Splash free zone: take a relaxing dip in an adults-only swimming pool And there are also blissful adults-only pools, where you can retreat for a relaxing afternoon, safe in the knowledge that expert carers are creating a fun-filled experience for your children. After all that work on board, you can treat your body to a soothing treatment in one of the spas. These extensive areas are only for the over-18s and include steam rooms, a sauna and relaxation area, as well as treatment rooms for a wide-ranging list of facials, wraps, massages and beauty treatments. Men have their own beauty menus, too, including traditional barber’s grooming. On three of the four ships, there are even private, couples-only massage cabanas. The spas at Walt Disney World offer equally extensive choices, and range from the Balinese-style Mandara spa, with its tea garden and meditation temple, to the Grand Floridian Senses Spa with its retreat-style, turn-of-the-century, Victorian gardens. • Find out more about Disney Cruises, Disney holidays and Walt Disney World", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:22:07.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
