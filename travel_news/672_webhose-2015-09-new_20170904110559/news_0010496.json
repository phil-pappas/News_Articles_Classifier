The market is dominated by premium hatchbacks such as Seat Ibiza and Peugeot 207. In 2013, Algeria imported vehicles worth nearly $7 billion .\nInternational automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) see Algeria as a good market with a strategic position from where cars can be produced and distributed in northern Africa . French OEMs such as Peugeot and Renault will continue to have a formidable presence in the region because of the close geographical and political proximity between France and Algeria .\nKey Findings:\nControle Technique (test to make sure that a car is fit to ply on the roads) is compulsory for passenger vehicles. The vehicles imported differ from those in their country of origin (for example, Mercedes Algeria does not have particulate filter on cars) Installation of anti-lock braking system (ABS) and airbags has been mandated by the Algerian government and future legislations are likely to move along the lines of the European Union norms. The emission norms in the country are currently at a nascent stage The growth in the automotive market is likely to move away from the entry-level segment to the premium segment as people trade up. The lower end is expected to be dominated by manufacturers who benefit from tariff reduction because of some type of industrial activity in the market. Key Topics Covered:\n1. Executive Summary\n2.
