Reunion Blvd.; 214-741-5560 , wolfgangpuck.com . Double Dagwoods \nChef David Hollister is opening two new Dagwoods restaurants back to back, and he makes that sound easy. \nA second Dagwoods Fire Grill Tapwill follow at 1063 Foch St., near the West 7th shops. \n“We’ve got sandwiches here, but the other restaurant will have more of a full menu,” said Hollister, who opened Dagwoods Grinders & Growlers this week in a strip shopping center off Alta Mere Drive near Ridgmar Mall. \nHis Dagwoods Fire Grill Tap will follow at 1063 Foch St., near the West 7th shops. \nIn Ridgmar, the artisan sandwich shop is opening alongside a barbecue restaurant and a Vietnamese pho shop in a neighborhood with mostly chain restaurants. \nThe opening menu featured a Cuban special plus a Reuben, a BLT, a grilled cheese, a stacked-high Dagwood, a superstacked “C-130” and other sandwiches with premium toppings, all for $7-$12. \n“There’s a demand for something different here by Lockheed [Martin Aeronatics] and the base,” he said, referring to Naval Air Station Fort Worth. \nHollister was with the late chef Paul Willis at the old Pedro’s Trailer Park, now Clay Pigeon Food + Drink . He went on to Yucatan Taco Stand, worked with Grady Spears at the old Grady’s and remains the consulting chef at Gas Monkey Bar & Grill in Dallas. \nDagwoods will feature Akaushi beef, a wood grill and meats cured in-house. \nIt’s open at 1736 Mall Circle; 817-404-9482 , dagwoodsdfw.com. \nBud Kennedy: 817-390-7538 , bud@star-telegram.com , @EatsBeat .
