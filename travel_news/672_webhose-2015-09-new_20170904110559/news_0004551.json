The CTO is enlisting the help of governments and individuals across the Region along with supporters from around the world, to mobilize and encourage assistance for the Government and People of Dominica. The CTO is using all of its offices to facilitate the process. \n“The time to help Dominica is now. In other times of need, the Caribbean as a Region has generously come together to provide assistance to those devastated by natural disasters, and we are confident that this spirit of generosity will be evident once again,” said Hugh Riley, Secretary General of the CTO.
