With similar core values, an aligned sense of social responsibility, and a shared belief in the positive impact that travel can have on the world, these two renowned brands will together offer travellers a meaningful and accessible way to experience the world.\nThis travel partnership-which coincides with G Adventures' 25 th anniversary-combines National Geographic's more than 125 years of global exploration, science and storytelling with the fun, authentic experiences for which G Adventures is internationally recognized. The initial collection of 70 trips is designed for travellers who appreciate the freedom to roam, but seek the structure and security that comes with travelling in a group. Each group will be led by a knowledgeable local guide, and most will be limited to 16 guests. Travellers will have the opportunity to connect with local people and cultures while discovering places where National Geographic's scientists and storytellers have shaped history.\n\"We are thrilled to be working with National Geographic-an organization that shares our values and a similar approach to travel-to offer our guests unique experiences that will forever change their expectations of travel,\" said Bruce Poon Tip, founder of G Adventures.\nThese two travel pioneers have worked closely together to create special experiences that bring travellers behind the scenes in incredible destinations-be it practicing a centuries-old tradition of throwing pots on a visit to a women's cooperative in Belize or joining a researcher on safari in South Africa to learn firsthand about a National Geographic-sponsored initiative to protect cheetahs and other big cats.\nForging true human connections will be an integral component of National Geographic Journeys with G Adventures. Travellers will have the opportunity to spend time in a family home in Jaipur, India ; share a meal with a local author and her storytelling troupe in Botswana ; meet a traditional weaver in Ecuador ; and sip homemade limoncello with a farmer at his lemon orchard in Italy .\nA 14-day trip to Costa Rica , priced from $2,099 , includes meeting with a researcher from the Sea Turtle Conservancy, co-founded by a National Geographic grantee. Many trips will feature visits to projects sponsored by G Adventures' nonprofit organization Planeterra, which develops sustainable projects to support local communities. As with all National Geographic travel programs, a portion of the proceeds will support the National Geographic Society's nonprofit work in conservation, exploration, education, and cultural preservation.\n\"Our partnership with G Adventures adds an exciting and accessible range of travel opportunities to our portfolio of extraordinary ways to explore the planet. We're excited to invite travelers around the world to experience the destinations they've dreamed about, get to know people in other cultures and make a positive impact while doing it,\" added Gary E. Knell , president and CEO of the National Geographic Society.\nThe new line will join National Geographic's suite of travel programs, which includes National Geographic Expeditions, National Geographic Adventures, National Geographic Student Expeditions, National Geographic Unique Lodges of the World, and more.\nNext year's lineup of National Geographic Journeys with G Adventures will be published on Dec. 15, 2015 , with departures beginning Jan. 5, 2016 .\nAbout National Geographic Travel\nNational Geographic Travel is the travel arm of the National Geographic Society, one of the world's largest nonprofit scientific and educational organizations, founded in 1888.
