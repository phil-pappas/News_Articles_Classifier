The 'gap-yah' guy, the rebrand, the single sex schooler – every student knows what to expect from their fellow freshers by now. But about the professors? These guys aren't as bland, boring or as basic as you'd think. So as you snooze your way through a year's worth of lectures, try and spare a thought for the unsuspecting professors who can often be just as interesting as the students themselves. The Golden Oldie: They joined the university what seems like a century ago, and no one really knows how old they are. But one thing is certain; they follow their own agenda. Lectures can range in length from 30 minutes to two hours, depending entirely on their mood, while ‘deadlines’ are an unknown entity that you rarely have the unfortunate of facing. Seminars are usually spent discussing the dire state of the university or general life as opposed to your course content. To put it bluntly, the Golden Oldie does not give a damn. The Top-Dog: These professors are the academic equivalent of a BNOC. They’re renowned both on and off campus for their work, regardless of what they teach, and they’ve become a leading expert in the country in their academic field. Just think Brian Cox or Ha-Joon Chang. As leading figures within their respective fields, it seems that every book in the library related to their subject has been written by them, and every other weekend they can be found jetting off to an international conference to discuss their latest findings. The closest you’ll ever get to a celebrity. Brian Cox, professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester Photo: REX FEATURES The Heart-throb: You’re not quite sure if it’s the jaeger-bombs from the night before or the fact they’re actually an international Italian model , but there’s always that one lecturer who you’ll find yourself worryingly drawn to. Their interpretation of quantum chromodynamics will leave you breathless while their authority in the lecture hall will set your heart racing. Countless hours will be spent trying to think of an appropriate question just to justify engaging in an “academic” conversation with them – when in reality, you’ll just be happy to be given their undivided attention. Not your typical maths lecturer... Photo: Instagram The Wannabe: Normally tutors, these guys try so hard it hurts. In their relentless attempt to befriend you, expect to be bombarded with questions of how your weekend was or whether or not you went out to “party”. Conversations will revolve around the nature of their week-long hangovers as they try their best to convince you that they’re actually still a student at heart. The Wannabe will frequently hint at joining you for a quick drink at the union, so make sure to be on your guard at all times. The Indiana Jones Imitator: They may not carry a whip or wear a fedora, but you wouldn’t be at all surprised to find out that this professor had been spending their weekends in search of the Lost Ark. Beyond teaching classes or running seminars, they’ll always be out in the field working on their research in a niche subject like British Celtic history or palaeontology (see ‘Ross Geller’ below …) Typically, they’re still relatively young compared to their academic counterparts and seem to have a lot more in common with you than the rest of their colleagues – that’s largely due to the fact that entertaining anecdotes from their own university days feature in all of their lectures. But for all their exploits, you can’t quite figure out if this professor is as cool as Harrison Ford’s Indiana Jones or is just a glorified nerd in disguise. The nearest you'll get to a real-life Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Jr. Photo: Paramount/Everett/Rex Features The Radical: This professor’s political radicalism still burns as brightly as the day they first joined 'Anarchists Anonymous' back in the 70s. Communism, socialism, libertarianism – these guys have tried it all. Expect them to attend every single student demonstration, where they will be found defiantly leading from the front with a megaphone in one hand and a sign declaring “Down with the Tories” in the other. Unsurprisingly, images of Karl Marx, Fidel Castro and Jeremy Corbyn adorn their office walls. The Philosopher: Much like Robin Williams' Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting , this professor knows all. For any question directed their way – regardless of whether it’s to do with theoretical physics or abstract expressionism – these professors will have an answer. Expect to walk away from each lecture with your mind blown or your understanding of life completely turned on its head. Questions of ‘how’, ‘what’, and ‘why’ will haunt you after every single one of their lectures and seminars. Alternatively, you could leave each lecture thinking 'what a load of rubbish'. All knowing and all seeing, the Philosopher can answer any of your questions Photo: AP The Newbie: Fresh-faced, eager to get started, observably excitable, this lecturer is very much the academic fresher. Having finished their PhD only months ago, they launched straight into teaching in a bid to inspire and enlighten every single student. As a consequence, their enthusiasm knows no limits. From painfully detailed seminars, during which every student can expect to be extensively interrogated, to lectures that zip by at 100 miles-per-hour, the Newbie will try their upmost to cover every single aspect of their module. This is information overload to the max. The last thing you need at 9am after a particularly taxing night out. The ‘Nutty Professor’: Not to be confused with Eddie Murphy’s Sherman Klump , each university wouldn’t be complete without its own ‘Nutty Professor'. Each lecture offers a new and bizarre experience courtesy of their eccentric mannerisms, and crowd participation is usually a guarantee – much to the horror of students shirking to avoid a question they simply don’t know the answer to. As for their general attire, anything from science themed ties to T-shirts sporting slogans such as “geology rocks” can be expected from these wisecracking oddballs. Fortunately, given their clear love for their subject, coupled with a usually questionable hobby (think warcraft and alike), these professors are often too absorbed in their own worlds to have any real idea of who you actually are. Without a doubt, every university has its own 'Nutty Professor' Photo: Universal Pictures / Film Stills The Technophobe: Quite simply, this professor hates anything remotely modern or shiny. Given their stubborn refusal to embrace the present, every aspect of their life is stuck in the past. Computers have been exchanged for typewriters, whiteboards for blackboards, cars for bicycles, and even pens for feather quills. The ‘Ross-a-tron’: For the diehard Friends fans , the ‘Ross Geller' professor is instantly recognisable. Despite their goofy, bumbling, and socially awkward demeanour, this professor is like the lame family uncle you just can’t help but love. Their jokes are so bad they’re funny, while their general goofiness is guaranteed to brighten every lecture. Just don’t expect any roller-skates or strange British accents any time soon. What's not to love about the 'Ross-a-tron'?
