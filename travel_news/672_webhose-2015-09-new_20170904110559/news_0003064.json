Noise does not escape as easily because of their cupped shape. The lightweight, metal headband flexes so that it wraps around your head. Often, I see people wearing headphones and they look ridiculous because you could fit your entire arm through the opening between the headband and their actual head. \nThese headphones look more stylized, but the most trendy feature is the Bluetooth compatibility they have with an audio bank or device. The right ear cup has a touch panel where you can fast forward or repeat song that is streaming via Bluetooth. The cord can detach if you want to operate them via Bluetooth or keep it on to connect with an airplaneâ€™s entertainment system or your laptop. \nThe headphones come in various colors, all with the matte finish. I found there to be a nice range of base sound without being overwhelming, and sometimes, I simply choose to nap with these on without music. The earpieces do a fine job of keeping out unwanted excess noise. \nMy biggest peeve with headphones, besides their bulky size, is the battery life. Somehow, the switch is always activated in my bag so that there is no power left when I want to use them. These headphones have a 10-hour lifespan plus the ability to recharge via USB. It takes two hours for them to fully recharge. \nFor such a fair price, this pair of headphones does a fine job of providing stereo sound with added Bluetooth functionality and a trim European design. They retail for $130 on the XQISIT website or for even less on Amazon  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T09:51:29.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
