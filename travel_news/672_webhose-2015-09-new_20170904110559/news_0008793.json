Keane struck with a 49th-minute tap-in and then converted a 51st-minute penalty to take his international goals tally to 67 and give Ireland a 3-0 lead after full-back Cyrus Christie had opened the scoring before the break. • Roy Hodgson offends San Marino manager Substitute Shane Long wrapped things up with a fourth goal 10 minutes from time as the Republic's hopes of Euro 2016 received a significant boost. Keane was denied the opportunity to match the hat-trick he scored against the same opposition last year when he and McCarthy were replaced by Shane Long and Stephen Quinn with 20 minutes remaining, O'Neill perhaps casting an eye towards Monday's potentially trickier clash with Georgia in Dublin. Gibraltar's big moment arrived with 18 minutes remaining when John Sergeant muscled his way through the green shirts to look Given in the eyes, but Brady covered across in the nick of time to block his shot. • Georgia 1 Scotland 0, match report Walters might have helped himself to a fourth goal with 18 minutes remaining, but he dragged his effort wide as he fell after Hoolahan's strike had been deflected towards him. Aiden McGeady joined the fray seconds later, but it was Hendrick who was the provider with 10 minutes remaining when he crossed for Long to power home a header and make it 4-0.
