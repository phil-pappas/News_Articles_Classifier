The shopping mecca boasts 2.5 million square feet of retail space, more than 500 stores and entertainment options that range from nightclubs to the Nickelodeon Universe amusement park to a 14-screen cinema. The Meetings Quest host hotel, the JW Marriott, is under construction adjacent to the Mall of America and is just 11 miles from the heart of downtown Minneapolis. The property offers 342 guest rooms and 18,000 square feet of meeting space. Also under construction nearby is the new U.S. Bank Stadium, which will host Super Bowl LII in 2018 and the NCAA Final Four in 2019. The stadium is scheduled to open in 2016. “When choosing a host city for Meetings Quest, we are always seeking out emerging destinations that have new and unique offerings for meeting planners,” said Timothy Schneider, president and CEO of Schneider Publishing Company, which publishes Association News and organizes Meetings Quest. “Bloomington fits the bill perfectly and will provide a one-of-a-kind networking and learning opportunity, which is what we aim to achieve with every Meetings Quest.” Recent Meetings Quest events have been held in Mesa, Arizona; Cabarrus County, North Carolina; Providence, Rhode Island; and Oakland, California. In addition to Bloomington, Meetings Quest is also scheduled to be held in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
