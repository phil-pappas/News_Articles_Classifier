Serving a four-course table d’hote dinner paired with fine wines atop a sand dune as the sun goes down on another day, it makes for a very special evening. • ayersrockresort.com.au 2 Sounds of Silence , Uluru For those of you looking for something a little less elaborate, Sounds of Silence, the award-winning outdoor dining experience at Ayers Rock Resort, is a perfect fit. Serving a range of dishes which incorporate native bush ingredients and Australian wines and beers, it’s a social gathering where you can share stories with other guests before sitting back to enjoy an illuminating guide to the night sky. • ayersrockresort.com.au 3 Nabilil Dreaming Sunset Dinner Cruise , Katherine Gorge Take to the waters of the spectacular Katherine Gorge in Nitmiluk National Park for an evening to remember.

Bob serves three delicious and beautifully presented courses incorporating a range of bush ingredients. He talks you through each course and tells stories of his culture. After dinner, perhaps take a look at the night sky or try to spot some nocturnal wildlife before returning to your hotel. • rttoursaustralia.com.au 5 Dinner cruise , Darwin Harbour Hop aboard the luxurious Charles Darwin for a relaxing evening on the water. Enjoy a seafood buffet dinner on board and then take to the top deck to watch the sun set over the water. The captain also gives a fascinating commentary on the history of Darwin as you cruise the foreshore. • darwinharbourcruises.com.au 6 Darwin’s dining scene Darwin is renowned for its eclectic dining scene and has a plethora of great restaurants to choose from whatever your budget. At the top of the pile has to be the multi-award winning Peewees at the Point , which specialises in local ingredients including great seafood. In the Central Business District, choose from Char an indoor/outdoor restaurant beautifully situated in a heritage building on the Esplanade, or Hanuman , an institution in NT dining circles serving Thai, Indian and Nonya cuisine. At the redeveloped Waterfront precinct, again there is a myriad of restaurants from which to choose – Chow for Vietnamese, Wharf One for wood-fired cooking and seasonal local produce, Il Lido for great pizzas or Hot Tamale for a great Mexican. It’s slightly out of town, but don’t ignore Cullen Bay Marina – home to Lola’s Pergola and Yots Taverna – or the SkyCity Resort , which hosts some award-winning restaurants, including Cove and EVOO. 7 Under a Desert Moon , Kings Canyon Set in the grounds of Kings Canyon Resort , this intimate outdoor dinner is for couples only. Start the evening with champagne and canapés before commencing a fabulous four-course dinner. End the evening with some stargazing before making the short trip back to your resort accommodation. 8 Luxury lodges The Northern Territory is lucky enough to be home to a selection of exceptional lodges, all of which place an emphasis on fine food and wine for their guests. In the Mary River region, just west of Kakadu, indulge in a stay at Bamurru Plains . Your stay at this luxury lodge is inclusive of all meals, drinks and most activities and has only nine bungalows, which fan out from the main lodge. Guests may choose from a range of activities, including 4WD touring and airboat trips across the flood plains. And at night, share the tales of your day with fellow guests over fine food and wine. Further south in Katherine, Cicada Lodge is perched atop Katherine Gorge. While not all-inclusive, the lodge prides itself on its food and wine. Only a stone’s throw from the Gorge itself, touring is easily arranged, be it a cruise, a walking tour or a helicopter flight over the National Park. At Uluru, the unique and luxurious Longitude 131° is the closest accommodation to Uluru itself. 15 “tents” span out from the main Dune House, all with views of the rock. Like Bamurru Plains, Longitude 131° is inclusive of all meals, drinks and most touring. Choose from a selection of private tours to Uluru and Kata Tjuta before returning to the lodge for a wonderful dinner. Evenings alternate between dinner in the Dune House to the outdoor Table 131°. 9 Darwin markets What better way to uncover the range of different cultures and nationalities that call Darwin home than to explore one of the city’s regular street markets? The most famous are the Mindil Beach Sunset Markets . These run every Thursday and Sunday evening from April to October, and don’t just serve great food, but also sell locally made crafts, art, jewellery and souvenirs. There’s often live music and always a great sunset from the beach. At weekends, choose from Parap Markets which run every Saturday morning, or Nightcliff Markets which run every Sunday. Both Parap and Nightcliff run year-round. Both are a great spot for a lazy brunch. 10 Alice Springs café culture While not necessarily the first place you would think of for a thriving café culture, Alice Springs has certainly evolved one in recent years. Small, independently owned cafés and bars have sprung up down laneways and on quiet corners, giving the town a fresh, bohemian air. A small selection worth a visit would be Page 27, Red Dog Café, the Watertank Café, Montes Lounge, and the Bean Tree café set in the Olive Pink Botanical Gardens.
