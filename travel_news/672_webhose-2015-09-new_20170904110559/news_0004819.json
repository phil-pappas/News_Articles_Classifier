I’m really proud of him because thousands of other people would have just driven passed.” \nA spokesman for Hampshire Police confirmed that six police officers attended the scene after they received the call at 12.50pm on Friday.

Their partner was called and took her to get assistance.” \nBy Felix Morris Promoted Stories Hampshire motorist Steve Hayden has been hailed a hero after saving a woman from plunging off a bridge over the M27 Sorry, an error occurred.

You wouldn't believe that if you listened to all the bumming cycists on here who probably wouldn't have stopped because they would have had to break and then use their little legs to build up speed again. They don't let anything get in their way when they have built up momentum. Well done that motorist! Ah, so not all motorists are bad then?
