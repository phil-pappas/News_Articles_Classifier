In my opinion and based on what I know of the case, it will have to be a conviction,” Attorney General Thelma Aldana told AFP.\n“At this time we have complete freedom to investigate whatever line of inquiry we deem pertinent in the president’s case,” said Aldana, who was appointed by Pérez Molina.\nThe president meanwhile failed in his bid to block the prosecutors’ investigation as the Constitutional Court ruled against two motions filed by his lawyers.\nThe five-judge court said it had ruled unanimously not to grant the petitions — one challenging the Supreme Court of Justice’s decision to allow prosecutors to open a criminal investigation, the other challenging the legality of the congressional investigative committee that subsequently recommended lifting his immunity.\n‘The Line’\nPérez Molina is the first president in the Central American country’s history to be stripped of his immunity, a decision that caused exasperated Guatemalans to burst into celebration Tuesday night after months of unprecedented protests.\nA judge subsequently barred the 64-year-old retired general from leaving the country.\nInvestigators say their accusations are based on some 89,000 wire-tapped phone calls that uncovered a scheme called “La Linea” (the line), named for a hotline businesses would call to access corrupt officials and get illegal discounts on their customs duties.\nPérez Molina has repeatedly denied involvement and rejected calls from the increasingly virulent protest movement for his resignation.\nThe scandal, which has already felled his former vice president and a string of top officials, comes as Guatemala prepares for elections Sunday to choose his successor.\nPérez Molina, in power since 2012, is constitutionally barred from running for re-election. His term ends on January 14.\nThe president has been left increasingly isolated by the scandal.\nSix of his 14 ministers have resigned in recent days, along with several other top officials.\nRead all our recent coverage of Guatemala’s high level corruption scandal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:11:46.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
