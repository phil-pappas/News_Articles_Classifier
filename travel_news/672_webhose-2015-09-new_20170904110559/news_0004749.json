The transportation safety and security systems are an integral part of aviation, cargo supply chain, maritime, and other popular passenger transport systems related to roadways and railroads. The inputs provided by these systems are used in law enforcement, border security, and intelligence services in a multi-jurisdictional platform. With the increasing traffic of goods in transit, it has become imperative for concerned agencies to ramp up security measures in sensitive infrastructures.\nTerrorists are developing innovative weapons of mass destruction, such as CBRN, to cause damage to the transportation industry. This has led to major technological companies in the domain come up with upcoming and advanced solutions. Systems that are already integrated include access control systems, video surveillance systems, secure communication systems, scanning and screening systems, and navigation and traffic control systems.\nTechnavio analysts forecast the transportation safety and transportation security market in Americas to grow at a CAGR of 7.98% in terms of revenue during 2014-2019.\nCovered in this Report\nThe report covers the present scenario and the growth prospects of the transportation safety and transportation security market in Americas for the period 2015-2019.
