The construction locomotives are used to carry people and materials through the tunnels.\nThe viewer can move the screen to look back at the driver or around the tunnels, cross passages and enlarged platform tunnels at Whitechapel and Liverpool Street Crossrail stations.\nThe video shows the completed tunnels, shortly before work to install the railway began.\nCrossrail tunnelling completed in May 2015 – eight 1,000 tonne tunnelling machines spent three years creating 42km or 26 miles of new 6.2 metre diameter rail tunnels under London. The tunnels weave their way between existing underground lines, sewers, utility tunnels and building foundations from station to station at depths of up to 42 metres.\nCrossrail construction commenced in 2009 at Canary Wharf and is now over 65% complete. Services through central London will commence in 2018.\nSource:- Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:17:35.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
