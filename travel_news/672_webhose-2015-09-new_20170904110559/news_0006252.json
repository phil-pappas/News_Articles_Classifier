In partnership with Birdies for the Brave, Callaway Golf will provide combat-injured warriors a custom fitting experience at the PGA TOUR event venue, and a new set of the company's premium golf clubs.\nThe goal of the program is to aid in the rehabilitation process of wounded heroes, and express gratitude to participating men and women for their service, courage and sacrifice. The Callaway Warrior Club Fitting at East Lake GC is the 14 th of 15 such events scheduled to take place during 2015.\nOriginating in 2012, the scale of the program has grown each year under Callaway Golf President & CEO, Chip Brewer .\n\"Callaway has contributed over $7.6 million to various military support causes,\" said Mr. Brewer in advance of the 100 th fitting. \"I'm particularly proud that the company's military appreciation programs, such as the Callaway Warrior Club Fittings in partnership with Birdies for the Brave, have been longstanding commitments.\"\nThe Callaway Warrior Club Fitting experience typically includes a guided tour of the company's Tour trailer, a full-service workshop that builds custom equipment for Callaway's Professional Tour Staff at PGA TOUR events, a custom fitting for all clubs and a putter, swing lessons, and often the opportunity to meet a Callaway Tour Pro on the driving range.\nThis Warrior Club Fitting initiative is a key part of Callaway Golf's overall commitment to military-related initiatives. The 100 th custom fitting milestone follows Callaway Golf's recent donation of more than $700,000 in golf equipment so that military troops and veterans can enjoy the game and work on their golf swings during valuable down time. This donation specifically benefited three partner organizations: Birdies For The Brave, Bunkers in Baghdad and the Miramar Marine Corps Community Services. The donation impacts military personnel overseas and wounded service men and women in the U.S.\nAbout Callaway Golf\nCallaway Golf Company (NYSE: ELY) creates products designed to make every golfer a better golfer.
