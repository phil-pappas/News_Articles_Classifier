From the spice gardens of Grenada and the volcanic spires of Saint Lucia to the turquoise waters of the Bahamas and the stunning powder-soft beaches of Antigua, each island has a distinct natural allure – which can make it tricky to settle on just one idyllic destination. So why settle on just one resort or island? Island Hopping is an appealing way to combine two or more resorts in one amazing holiday. Scattered across the Caribbean in Jamaica, Barbados, Antigua, Saint Lucia, Grenada and the Bahamas, each of Sandals’ 15 Luxury Included ® water-edge resorts enjoys a gorgeous setting. A twin-centre holiday at Sandals Ochi Beach Resort and Sandals Montego Bay is a guaranteed, fun-filled holiday You could plan a dream wedding on the stunning emerald isle of Saint Lucia, for example, then hop on a short flight to enjoy a honeymoon in Sandals Grande Antigua Resort & Spa in Dickenson Bay, hailed as the world’s most romantic resort. If you yearn for an active sporty holiday with paradise accoutrements, why not combine a week of golf at Sandals Ochi Beach Resort in Jamaica (where play at the Sandals Golf & Country Club is unlimited and green fees are included) followed by a stay in Sandals’ newest resort in Barbados , where certified scuba divers can explore the underwater world for free? If a restorative chill-out holiday is the ideal, you can divide your time between Sandals Emerald Bay in Great Exuma – where the Red Lane ® Spa specialises in indulgent pampering of mind, body and soul – and Nassau. Here, you can swim up to your Crystal Lagoon suite and, venturing further afield, explore the secluded coves and turquoise waters that lap the resort's offshore island. Won over by the reggae vibes and non-stop partying of Jamaica? A twin-centre holiday at Sandals Ochi Beach Resort and Sandals Montego Bay is a guaranteed, fun-filled holiday. Saint Lucia, the island of volcanic skylines and lush rainforest, fought over by the French and English for almost 200 years, is another potential twin-centre destination which enthrals guests with its colour and flair. Marry a week at the tropical garden sanctuary of Halcyon Beach with a further seven days in a Sunset Bluff oceanfront suite with mesmerising views at Sandals Regency La Toc Golf Resort & Spa, and you will experience the ultimate in romantic tranquillity. Or if time is not a restriction, why not stay longer and indulge in a Sandals Eastern Caribbean odyssey that will allow you to hop between Antigua, Saint Lucia, Grenada and Barbados in one all-inclusive itinerary?
