Not many of us are aware of the historical significance Goa has had since the Portuguese era. The churches of Old Goa have been standing firm since decades, answering prayers of devotees. We have remembered some these timeless beauties below. Basilica of Bom Jesus It has been declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The basilica holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier and is visited by devotees every year. The interiors of this place are sort of rustic from the outside but magnificent from the inside.

All that it has today is the 46 m high tower. The church was built in 1602 by Augustinian friars.

Small yet elegant is what defines this place. Very few people take note of the immense historical significance of this chapel. The look of the chapel is very simple with brown and white interiors.

It has been beautifully restored. The church gives excellent views of the Mandovi River and Divar Island but unfortunately it is frequently locked.
