Many of the more than 50 volunteers who are making WILD happen this year attended for the first time in 2015 and felt compelled to keep WILD strong.\"\nThe theme for this year's summit is IMPACT! \"How can we impact the things we care about – our businesses, our teams, our community? What works? How do we measure it? These are some of the questions that will spark conversations leading attendees to feel, think and act differently,\" said Imig.\nThe WILD Summit IV will take place on April 1, 2016 at the Marriott Hotel in Westminster, CO.
