The three events take place on September 10th, 19th and 26th. \nThe qipao (or cheongsam), the popular traditional one-piece dress worn today by Chinese women attending formal events, has a long history, dating back nearly 500 years to the 1600s of the Qing dynasty, when a loose-fitting version was worn as everyday clothing by men and women alike. The stylish and often tight-fitting qipao that is best known today was created in the 1920s in Shanghai and made fashionable by socialites and upper class women of that era. The Chinese Qipao Festival is hosted and sponsored by ICN TV Network, Beauty Media Inc., YouKu Inc. and the China Intercontinental Communication Center. \nThe festival consists of three events: \nQipao Flash Mob in Times Square Date: Sep. 10th Location: Times Square \nA flash mob of one hundred Chinese women, accompanied by finalists from the Qipao Beauty Pageant and a delegation of foreign students from New York Film Academy, each dressed in a qipao of unique design, will make an appearance at Times Square. The focus of the event and presentation is to give New Yorkers and visitors to Times Square an opportunity to learn more about Chinese traditional costume and Eastern artistic vision. \nThe Qipao Beauty Pageant Time: 4:00PM – 6:30PM Location: Broad Street Ballroom \nThe Qipao Beauty Pageant Contest has been attracting the attention of Chinese fashion models not only in the New York area but also from around the globe. This prominent event has currently gone through the initial and semi-final rounds. Through blind auditions, the contestants will be divided into five teams, each team led by an experienced and talented mentor or coach. The coach will work with each contestant to perfect their performance. At the event, the 50 finalists will enter the last round of the competition for the coveted winning title. \nThe Qipao Gala Time: 6:00PM – 10:00PM Location: Gotham Hall \nOne of the highlights of Qipao Festival is the Qipao Gala that will be held on the eve of the traditional Chinese Mid-Autumn holiday. \nCelebrities and distinguished guests representing a cross-section of disciplines across the fashion industry, among them renowned fashion icon and successful entrepreneur Yue-Sai Kan and topflight Chinese model Ai-Li. The entire event will be videotaped and broadcast throughout China and to Chinese-speaking communities worldwide through Youku.com, the world's leading Chinese-language video-sharing website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T05:39:02.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
