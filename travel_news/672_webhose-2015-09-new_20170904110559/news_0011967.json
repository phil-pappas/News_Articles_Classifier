The growth was driven by Dubai Airports’ strategic decision to relocate all dedicated freighters from Dubai International to DWC in May last year.\nPassenger traffic for the period totalled 209,989in the first half of 2015 down 64 per cent from the 578,129passengers recorded in the same period last year due to the surge in volumes created by the temporary relocation of 300 flights per week while the runway refurbishment programme was conducted at Dubai International.\nAircraft movements totalled 20,866 in the first half of 2015, down 17 per cent from the 25,184 movements achieved in the same period last year.\n“The story is only just beginning for DWC but the early results continue to impress,” said Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports. “The airport is quickly emerging as an important cargo hub and with the addition of 70 weekly flydubai flights to 7 new destinations in October we expect the airport to soon establish itself as an important gateway to the Middle East.”\nOnce flydubai operations commence this October, DWC will offer passengers a total of 190 weekly flights to 17 destinations.\nSource:- Dubai Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:07:27.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
