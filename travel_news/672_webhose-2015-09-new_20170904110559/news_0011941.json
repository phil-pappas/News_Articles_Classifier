A number of collaborations with various partners in the airline distribution segment have been successfully pursued over the last few weeks.\nThe efforts to develop and establish new “direct connect” booking channels are generating strong interest among the industry partners. “The market is clearly ready for innovations and developments of this kind,” confirms Jens Bischof, Member of the Executive Board and Chief Commercial Officer of Lufthansa German Airlines. “Our realignment of our distribution has prompted an intensive exchange of views and experiences within our industry.”\n“This process has had its share of controversy, too,” Bischof concedes. “But we are still as convinced as ever that offering advanced and, at the same time, substantially cheaper additional booking channels – that also allow us to better present our products – is in our customers’ best interests. And that’s why we consistently pursue the further development of our distribution channels.”\nAs planned, the airlines of the Lufthansa Group are now taking a further major step in implementing their new commercial strategy by ensuring that from tomorrow (1 September), the costs of bookings made via global distribution systems (GDSs) are met more fairly and transparently by the users involved. To this end, a new “distribution cost charge” (DCC) of EUR 16 will now be applied to any ticket issued via GDS.\nCustomers of the Lufthansa Group can obtain their tickets without having to pay the new DCC by making their bookings via the member airlines’ websites, via an airline service center or at an airport ticket desk. Travel agents may also use the dedicated www.LHGroup-agent.com online portal as a booking alternative.\nCorporate customers can continue to make their bookings at their individually-agreed contractual rates (i.e. with no DCC) via www.LH.com. Lufthansa has also concluded a new agreement with technology provider Concur, an SAP company, under which Concur will provide the Lufthansa Group’s corporate customer travel management units with special programs for managing these www.LH.com bookings from next year onwards.\n“We want to work together with the travel agents and the global distribution systems to make the sale of air tickets more up-to-date, more inexpensive and more customer-minded,” Lufthansa CCO Bischof emphasizes. “And to this end we have swiftly developed a range of IT solutions that will be offered to our customers in the near future.”\nThe airlines of the Lufthansa Group have been particularly active devising solutions together with key technology partners that will enable them to develop and offer new “direct connect” booking channels. Parallel to this, the airlines are working on providing booking platforms for key-account corporate clients which will give them and their corporate travel agencies direct access to the air travel products of the Lufthansa Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T00:56:39.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
