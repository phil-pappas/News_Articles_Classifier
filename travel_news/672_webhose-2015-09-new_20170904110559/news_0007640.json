Starting on April 4, 2016, Austria’s national carrier will operate a Boeing 777 to Shanghai throughout the entire year. In April 2016 the flights will be offered five times a week, as of May 1, 2016 on a daily basis. This is the airline’s second destination in China in addition to Beijing. The flight time from Vienna to Shanghai at a distance of more than 8,500 kilometers from Vienna will be about 10 hours 20 minutes. The destination is not only interesting as a point-to-point route but also for transfer traffic. About two-thirds of passengers will transfer at the Vienna hub and continue their journeys, flying particularly to Western and Eastern European destinations.\nAt present Austrian Airlines offers a total of 26 weekly nonstop flights to Asia in its summer flight schedule. In addition to 5 flights per week to Beijing, the airline also offers up to 7 flights per week to Delhi operating a Boeing 767. Bangkok and Tokyo are serviced with daily flights on a Boeing 777. Furthermore, it is launching flight service once per week to the tourist destination of Colombo, the capital city of Sri Lanka, starting October 27, 2015. “Shanghai will complement our offering to the most important cities of Asia very well”, explains Andreas Otto, Chief Commercial Officer of Austrian Airlines. “In this way we are resolutely expanding flight service on long-haul routes.”\nAustrian Airlines had already included Shanghai in its flight schedule starting on April 28, 2004. However, flight service was terminated in January 2007 as part of the redimensioning of the airline’s long-haul fleet and the related decommissioning of all its Airbus A330 and A340 long-haul aircraft. “Shanghai once again offers potential thanks to the significantly improved market environment and increased local demand”, CCO Otto adds.\nFlights Vienna-Shanghai-Vienna as of April 4, 2016\nRoute Flight number Flight days Departure Arrival Vienna-Shanghai OS075 daily except Tuesday and Saturday 13:20 05:40 next day Shanghai-Vienna OS076 daily except Wednesday and Sunday 10:50 16:10\nFlights Vienna-Shanghai-Vienna as of May 1, 2016\nRoute Flight number Flight days Departure Arrival Vienna-Shanghai OS075 daily 13:20 05:40 next day Shanghai-Vienna OS076 daily 10:50 16:10\nFrom all four Lufthansa Group hubs to Shanghai\nWith the new flights to Shanghai operated by Austrian Airlines, the Lufthansa Group then offers nonstop flight connections from Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and Zurich to the Chinese metropolis. Starting with the summerflight schedule even two daily flights will be serviced from Frankfurt. The offering of the Lufthansa Group encompasses a total of 5 flights a day, corresponding to 35 flights per week as of May 1, 2016. As a result, Shanghai is already the sixth destination served by all four hubs in addition to New York JFK, Newark, Chicago, Beijing and Delhi in the summer flight schedule. The flights of Lufthansa, SWISS and Austrian Airlines are spread out over the day, so that the flight schedules offer customers optimal travelling flexibility.\nFlights from all four hubs of Lufthansa Group to Shanghai as of May 1, 2016\nRoute Flight number Flight days Departure Arrival from Frankfurt LH728\nLH732 daily\ndaily 17:10 22:05 09:55 next day\n14:55 next day from Munich LH726 daily 22:15 15:10 next day from Vienna OS075 daily 13:20 05:40 next day from Zurich LX188 daily 13:05 07:05 next day\nFlights from Shanghai to all four hubs of Lufthansa Group as of May 1, 2016\nRoute Flight number Flight days Departure Arrival to Frankfurt LH729\nLH733 daily\ndaily 13:15 23:35 19:10\n05:20 next day to Munich LH727 daily 23:35 05:35 next day to Vienna OS075 daily 10:50 16:10 to Zurich LX189 daily 09:30 15:50", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:11:13.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
