Events held during the exhibition include procurement meetings, fishery and seafood summit forums, fish master forums and new product presentations. \nThe fishery industry now faces a global crisis as we are draining ocean resources. With a firm industrial foundation and world-leading technologies, Taiwan is now able to artificially breed over 100 aquatic species, including six of the seven artificially bred grouper species in the world. Owning a complete germplasm bank, the fishing industry is an unsung hero among Taiwan's traditional industries, providing the perfect edge for global industrial transition and upgrade. \nThe 2015 Taiwan International Fisheries and Seafood Show will present a complete picture of the accomplishments that Taiwan's fishery industry has achieved, and will serve as the best platform in Asia for promoting sustainable fishery and seafood transactions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:52:01.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
