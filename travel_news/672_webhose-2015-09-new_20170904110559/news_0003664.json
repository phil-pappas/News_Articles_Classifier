Baby insists on turning up the tunes\nCUNARD'S ROYAL THREE Cunard owns three 'royal ships; the Queen Mary 2, the Queen Elizabeth and the Queen Victoria.\nQueen Mary 2 is the matriarch of the group – and the biggest.\nLaunched in March 2003, she is capable of holding up to 2,620 passengers, and is the largest vessel ever to have been built for Cunard.\nShe is also four years older than her nearest relative Queen Victoria, who was completed in January 2007, and is smaller than the QM2, with a capacity of 2014 people.\nThe baby of the bunch is Queen Elizabeth.\nThe first parts of the ship that will be spruced up are the renowned Queens and Princess Grill suites and restaurants - which are said to offer the same standards as the world's finest five star hotels.\nThe aims, Cunard said, are for the ship to stay true to her classic art deco heritage, while offering updated crisp, contemporary interiors painstakingly re-designed for today's most discerning travellers.\nThe Cunard Grills experience affords the line's most selective guests the highest standards of comfort at sea with large, well-appointed suites, all with prime locations and private balconies.\nThe exclusive benefits of the historic Grills experience will remain unchanged, but all 172 Grills suites on the Queen Mary 2 will receive a comprehensive restyling, reconfigured to maximize space.\nThere will be soothing muted tones and elegant textures, Cunard said, with new bespoke luxury carpet throughout featuring design work inspired by rugs from the original Queen Mary.\nThe Grills dining experience will also be elevated and Queen Mary 2's two Grill restaurants will both be reconfigured, with more tables for two, increased space between the tables and additional loose tables for flexibility and an improved ambiance, Cunard stated.\nThe decor and furnishings will be redesigned to offer 'beautiful and elegant' dining rooms that will 'compliment the enticing menus and excellent White Star service'.\nBack in July this year crowds gathered in Liverpool to celebrate as the Queen Mary 2 set off on an Atlantic crossing, recreating Cunard's first journey of that kind back in 1840\nThere will again be a clearer differentiation between the Queens Grill and Princess Grill restaurants through design, colour scheme and furnishings.\nUnder the moniker 'Queen Mary 2 remastered,' there will be a host of further innovations and enhancements announced in the coming months.\nAngus Struthers, Cunard Director, said: 'Queen Mary 2's Grill suites and restaurants are already rated as the best of the best. The work to be undertaken in 2016 will ensure they continue to be the finest luxury experience at sea, with an unparalled glamour and sophistication.\n'I am confident that the new Grills experience on board the world's most iconic ship will attract even more accolades and exceed the expectations of all those who book to sail Queens Grill or Princess Grill.'\nThis year Cunard is celebrating its 175th anniversary of the first Atlantic crossing. The cruise liner first changed the face of sea travel back in 1840, when its Britannia ship successfully set sail from Liverpool, arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, 14 days later.\nAnd in Liverpool in July, the Queen Mary 2 was greeted with fanfare and fireworks as it set off on the same voyage to honour the historic date.\nDANCING QUEENS! CUNARD'S QUEEN VICTORIA AND QUEEN ELIZABETH CRUISE SHIPS JOIN THE QUEEN MARY 2 IN LIVERPOOL FOR A SYNCHRONISED 'RIVER DANCE' CELEBRATING THE COMPANY'S 175TH ANNIVERSARY The world's largest and grandest ocean liner, the Queen Mary 2, was joined for the first time ever on the River Mersey by fellow fleet members the Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth back in May this year for an unprecedented 'dance' in celebration of Cunard's 175th anniversary.\nAlthough the festivities went on for the past three days, the main event took place in Liverpool on Monday with a precision manouevre by the three vessels in front of thousands of spectators.\nAfter their rotation the ships formed a spectacular arrowhead formation, then posed for the cameras before arranging themselves three abreast for the first time in any body of water.\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Some of the internet's funniest reactions to bad plane food\nWatch video Tourists offered chance to stroke lions in the dead of night\nWatch video Cunard's flagship Queen Mary 2 cruise liner gets huge refub\nWatch video Passengers use industrial-strength cling film to secure luggage\nWatch video Meet the man who's been on 16 stag dos... all with strangers\nWatch video 'Do you know who I am?': Driver loses it in road rage rant\nWatch video UK tourists skinny dip in one of Rome's historic fountains\nWatch video The Pope meets the Pope: Pontiff blesses baby dressed as him\nWatch video Wayne Rooney: The Man Behind The Goals trailer for BBC One\nWatch video Mom's hidden camera shows how dad really looks after the kids\nWatch video Miracle baby Jaxon Buell shows off his walking and talking\nWatch video But this is my JAM! Baby insists on turning up the tunes\nAfter their rotation the ships formed a spectacular arrowhead formation, then posed for the cameras\nThe 'dance' was to culminate with a flyover salute by nine jets from the famous Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's Aerobatic Team.\nThe Queen Mary 2 treated onlookers to a magnificent sail-past of the city's historic waterfront earlier this weekend, before tying up at the berth for a little over 24 hours.\nDuring her overnight stay, the 2,600 passengers on board were able to visit Liverpool's sights and experience the energy of the city.\nThe vessels, named the Three Queens, perform their impressive turn in front of thousands of spectators to mark Cunard's 175th anniversary\nAnd to mark such a significant occasion - the first time that all three Queens have taken to the water together - the Red Arrows were also on hand to complete a series of impressive manoeuvres in their honour.\nThe world famous acrobatic team followed the Mersey, flying in formation over the three ships in what was one of the most extraordinary spectacles that the city has ever seen.\nCunard Director, Angus Struthers, said at the time: 'The arrival of the Queen May 2, the largest passenger ship ever to sail up the Mersey, signalled the beginning of Cunard's Salute to Liverpool celebrations in the place where the Cunard story began 175 years ago.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1FzW15j", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-09-29T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:31:05.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
