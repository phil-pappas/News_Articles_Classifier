Because of this, Oregon was invited to share a taste of its culinary splendor at the USA Pavilion during Expo Milano 2015, at the James Beard American Restaurant, and with attendees of a VIP dinner hosted by the U.S. Consul General, Milan, Ambassador Philip T. Reeker.\n“Oregon is a place where visitors can come and taste award-winning wines, sip hand-crafted beers and enjoy some of the freshest ingredients available,” said Todd Davidson, Travel Oregon CEO. “We know that once people get a taste of Oregon, they are more likely to visit. So we are thrilled to introduce the flavors of Oregon to the hundreds of thousands of influential, global consumers at Expo Milano 2015.”\nFrom Oct. 2 to 22 Oregon will take over Food Truck Nation at the USA Pavilion at Milano Expo, with Oregon branding and custom menus including: a Northwest Sockeye Sandwich, an Oregon Trail Burger and Chocolate Hazelnut Cupcakes. Oregon wines, Willakenzie Pinot Gris and Soter Planet Pinot Noir, will also be featured at Food Truck Nation and at the Roof Top Terrace & Café on the Expo grounds, thanks to a sponsorship by the Oregon Wine Board.\nFood Truck Nation, a popular venue that is open to all festival goers, serves regional American street food with a nod toward wholesomeness and sustainability. Approximately 5,000 people visit Food Truck Nation daily during the Expo.\n“Food Truck Nation brings a popular American trend that took hold in cities across America to Expo. Our partnerships with various states such as Oregon, and Brand USA, allow us to showcase the regionalism of American food, a variety that people don’t always associate with eating in the United States,” said Mitchell Davis, Chief Creative Officer of the USA Pavilion. “Oregon is one of the regions of the U.S. with the richest, most articulated culinary traditions in the country. That’s why we are happy to host them at Food Truck Nation.”\nMike Thelin, Co-Founder of Feast Portland, will present an Oregon-themed talk at the Milan Expo on Oct. 5, covering insights on Oregon’s agricultural regions and products and why Oregon has become the ideal destination for a world-class food festival.\nOregon’s presence in Italy will be highlighted by a special Oregon-themed dinner served at the residence of the U.S. Consulate in Milan. The dinner will be prepared by Gregory Gourdet of Departure Restaurant and Lounge. This VIP dinner will feature an Oregon-inspired menu prepared with an Asian flare. Award-winning wines from Ponzi and Witness Tree Vineyards will complement the dinner. Visit USA members, trade professionals, Delta Airlines representatives and media will attend the Consulate dinner.\nTravel Oregon’s three-week international presence in Italy will be topped off at the James Beard American Restaurant with the Oregon Ambassador Chef, Naomi Pomeroy of Beast, preparing dinners on Oct. 23 and 24. The James Beard American Restaurant at Seven Stars Galleria showcases regional flavors, American traditions, modern gastronomy, sustainable practices, and the evolution of American cuisine. Chef Cathy Whims of Nostrana represented Oregon here in June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:07:28.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
