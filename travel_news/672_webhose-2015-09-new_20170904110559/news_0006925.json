The reports generated with consistency quality and complete transparency will feed back to individual hotels and to QTA boosting our collective ability to draw insights and make informed decisions on planning and promotion activities” said QTA Chief Tourism and Development Officer Hassan Al Ibrahim. \n\nOver 40 of Qatar’s 119 hotel establishments already participate in STR Global’s hotel performance measurement system. Once remaining hotel establishments activate their participation in STR Global they too will have access to regular performance data and performance data comparisons between their own hotel and others within the same classification or among a chosen competitor set. Hotel establishments can also measure their performance against international benchmarks and retrospective data. Current STR Global participants also will benefit as the planned full participation across the market will significantly improve the robustness and usefulness of performance reports. \n\n“This new vehicle for measuring performance is of immense value to those in the public and private sector working to achieve a more sustainable and mature tourism industry and I urge all hotels to continue submitting their statistics through STR Global for their benefit and the benefit of the sector” said Al Ibrahim. \n\nUp until the beginning of 2015 QTA was measuring the performance of hotels in Qatar now numbering 97 by manually gathering data on occupancy revenue per available room average room rate and other revenue. In 2015 QTA added all hotel apartments in Qatar (now 22) to its data stock and launched a new monthly data collection form that automatically calculates key performance indicators using STR Global’s recognized standards and guidelines. \n\n“Today thanks to QTA’s new partnership with STR Global we will be able to give ourselves and our partners across the entire tourist accommodation sector access to more timely more detailed and richer data sets while removing the burden of special-request and sometimes duplicative reporting to QTA that the hotel establishments have carried” he said. The agreement is part of QTA’s ongoing efforts to automate most of its processes including data collection he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T10:32:25.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
