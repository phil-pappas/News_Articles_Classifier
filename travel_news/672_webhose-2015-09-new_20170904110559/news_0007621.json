Greece to Turkey Ferry Route MapFerry Route Map Â© James Martin, Licensed to About.com Notes on Greece to Turkey Ferries \nSome ferries run only during the summer tourist season, while others have a drastically reduced winter season. Note also that port taxes are astronomical. \nYou can find general information on ferries from Aegean Ferry Services . Many tourists make ferry reservations on the run, stopping in a port city, going to the port or to a travel agent and booking a ferry trip. Aegean allows you to book online, if you find that necessary in the heart of tourist season. Turkey Map and Travel Planner \nFor more information on vacation activities on western coast of Turkey, see our Western Turkey Map . Turkish Ferry Port Cities \nIf your destination is Turkey and you like visiting ancient sites, The Samos to Kusadasi route might be your best bet, as the extraordinary sights like Ephesus, Pamukkale and Aphrodisias are easily accessable from Kusadasi. There is lots of lodging available in Kusadasi, and nightlife is lively. \nFind out more about: Samos , Kusadasi Hotels (Book Direct) , Ferry from Kusadasi to Samos \nThe Kos to Bodrum route might be my second favorite route. Bodrum, a modern resort town built on the ruins of Halicarnassus in 1402, features a 15th century Crusader Castle (which now houses the Museum of Underwater Archaeology), an airport, lots of shopping and a very lively nightlife. \nFind out more about: Bodrum Hotels (book direct) , Bodrum Espress Lines (Hydrofoil & Ferryboat Services) \nI enjoy the island of Rhodes , so my third route preference might pass through it. Fethiye is known for its beaches and yachting. You can take a 12 island Yacht cruise from the harbor at Fethiye.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T15:54:28.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
