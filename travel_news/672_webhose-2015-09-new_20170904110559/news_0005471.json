Cultural experiences South Africa's rugby museum becomes top global attraction 21 September 2015 The Springbok Experience Rugby Museum in Cape Town has been named in the top 1% of world attractions by Trip Advisor, the world's largest travel site. The museum, established by the South African Rugby Union (Saru), celebrates its second birthday on Heritage Day. It has been awarded Trip Advisor's highest accolade, a Travellers' Choice Award, in its latest citations. SARU's #SpringbokExperience Rugby Museum @bokrugby has been named in the top 1% of world attractions, by @TripAdvisor @VandAWaterfront Â— Springbok Experience (@Bokmuseum) September 17, 2015 The granting of the award is determined by Trip Advisor's algorithm. It takes into account several factors, including the reviews of travellers. More than boots and blazers \"This is a very gratifying award and is reward for all the hard work that went into the establishment of The Springbok Experience as well as for the on-going dedication of the staff,\" said Jurie Roux, Saru chief executive. \"We have had fantastic feedback from visitors whose overwhelming response has been that it is so much more than they were expecting: it's not just boots and blazers, it really is an experience.\" Visual and interactive \"It delivers a technology-driven 'wow' experience for visitors, combining iconic object, interactive games and a rich audio-visual component to tell South Africa's story through the eyes of its most powerful sport,\" informs the museum's website. \"There are 91 media channels playing across touch screens, monitors and projectors, which requires 14km of cabling to help tell the story,\" said Roux. \"That story carries on across half a kilometre of printed graphic panels as well as through some beautifully preserved objects. \"We have a short movie about rugby in South Africa today as well as the game-playing 'Springbok Trials' zone, which has a series of specially created interactive games that test rugby skills such as passing, kicking, fitness and reactions.\" The museum is located at Portswood House at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town and opened its doors in 2013.
