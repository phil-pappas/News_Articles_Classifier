Hundreds of mature trees are being chopping down. The park has a special significance as this is the place where Henry kept wife Catherine of Aragon a prisoner.\nResidents of the area, Ampthill, a picturesque Georgian market town, are furious and feel that the council is desecrating and destroying the heavens for all the wildlife. They were not even informed about the plan of hacking down hundreds of mature silver birch trees. People often took walks in the park and are shocked at the way the park is being treated. The rabbits that burrow in the park and the nearby roads are being driven out.\nHowever the hall officials claim that they wish to restore the landscape like the gardener Lancelot had done in the 18th century. The park will be improved for visitors, which has recently gathered much attention owing to Kit Williams who buried his golden hare in his Masquerade treasure hunt.\nThe Town council however argues that the park is being made more accessible for everyone no historic trees are being touched only regenerated trees and shrubs are being removed. This they claim will enhance the beauty of the park and make the park visitor friendly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:53:37.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
