This represents the largest contract for HUDs and the first ever for a dual configuration system since the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) made it mandatory for all Chinese registered aircraft to be equipped with HUDs (single HUD configuration is the minimum requirement). This further milestone cements Thales's continued position of strength in the Chinese avionics sector over 1000 Chinese registered aircraft equipped. In China Thales enjoys 60% market share in FMS, 70% market share in IFEC, 40% coverage in air traffic management. The dual configuration developed by Thales, and certified by Airbus in early 2015 is a clear step forward compared to a single configuration as it provides information to both pilots. With eyes focused outside, viewing the presentation of flight path, acceleration, visual glide slope angle and the runway aim point, both pilot and co-pilot can achieve greater precision and situational awareness at all times and are able to interact with one another with the same level of information during the critical phases of the flight, especially in low visibility conditions. With this contract, Thales becomes a leader in HUD technology in China. The Group will equip its HUDs acrossChina Eastern, Sichuan Airlines and Loong Air, as well as Spring Airways. Key points Thales is the first to supply a dual HUD system in China, representing the largest ever contract for this system in the country. With HUDs equipped across several major Chinese airlines, Thales becomes leading HUD developer in the country. With equipment on over 1000 Chinese aircraft, a 60% market share in FMS, 70% market share in IFEC, 40% coverage in air traffic management Thales is the largest international aerospace developer in China. \"As skies become more congested, Head Up Displays are becoming a mainstay for pilots. China is leading the world in adopting this technology and Thales has invested considerable efforts in developing the most highly performing HUD on the market. This latest contract is the culmination of our efforts and we look forward to working together with longstanding customers like China Southern.\" Daniel Malka, Thales VP, Avionics Services Worldwide About Thales Thales is a global technology leader for the Aerospace, Transport, Defence and Security markets.
