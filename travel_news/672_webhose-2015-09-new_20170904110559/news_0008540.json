With such rich surroundings to our flagship event, it is no wonder our guests value the experience greatly and are looking forward to returning for a second year.”\n \n“We are very pleased to be hosting the PGAs of Europe’s Annual Congress again this year,“ explained Öznur Özdemir Özaltin, CEO of Gloria Hotels & Resorts. “We are especially excited to relive the International Team Championship, which is a key part of the Congress week. Last year the Scots took the glory – we can’t wait to see who will win this time around!”\n \nWith Gloria’s fantastic Serenity Resort acting as the base for both events, the week will conclude with a gala award dinner, bringing Congress delegates and ITC competitors together in celebration of the Association’s 25th Anniversary, the annual award winners and the ITC Champions.\n \nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:27:08.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
