This year’s Britain’s Healthiest Company employee questionnaires reveal encouraging findings. For example, 57 per cent of people questioned said they are motivated to improve their BMI, and 52 per cent said they would like to engage in more physical activity. There is, however, less positive news elsewhere in the results. The average difference between a person’s actual age and their Vitality Age has stayed constant since last year, the latter being three years and 10 months older. It’s good that the gap hasn’t got any bigger, but it obscures a more worrying trend – the biggest difference between calendar age and Vitality Age is seen in those aged between 51 and 60, and the next most at-risk age group is the one below, between 41 and 50. With employers and the overall economy relying on people working for longer, it is crucial to engage with these age groups and to help them stay healthy. The 2015 survey findings suggest that there is some way to go before UK businesses can say they are truly responding to this need. Consider the fact that only 24 per cent of all employees surveyed have been screened for high cholesterol, blood pressure and glucose in the past 12 months. Since these are major causes of health problems in middle and old age, detecting issues should be a top priority for employers concerned about the long-term well-being of their staff. We need to reward those who adopt new behaviours A committed approach to driving behavioural change is also necessary – perhaps by offering employees incentives to improve their health. For example, negotiating modest discounts at everyday retailers for staff who achieve either weight-loss targets or other fitness goals works well and costs little. In addition, employers need to focus on areas where employees show resistance to change. Smoking is a good example, although an encouraging 37 per cent of respondents who are smokers said they are motivated to try giving up. Alcohol consumption is another potential problem area: only 2.5 per cent of those questioned said they want to change their drinking habits. If we are to drive behavioural change across these areas, we need to reward those who adopt new behaviours. In addition, the gamification of healthy activities (in the form of phone apps that set weekly targets, for example) is a good way of encouraging staff to measure positive outcomes. The most pressing need is to make British workers more active. People may say that they are motivated to do more, but 35 per cent of those surveyed admitted to taking less than the recommended 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week. While UK businesses are becoming more concerned about the health of employees, there is still work to be done. To see a real improvement, employers need to pursue proactive interventions that change behaviour, help staff form new habits, and put employee health and well-being at the centre of their corporate strategy.
