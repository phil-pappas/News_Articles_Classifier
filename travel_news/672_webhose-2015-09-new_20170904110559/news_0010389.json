In the far north-west region of Epirus, the villages of Zagoria owe their charm to awe-inspiring geological features, old arched bridges and Byzantine churches. In the eastern part of the country, Pelion is a herb-scented haven, with amazing sea and mountain vistas, while the Peloponnese in the south boasts Monemvasia, the spectacular rock known as the Mont Saint-Michel of Greece. Part of the cradle of ancient civilisation, with trading posts once feverishly fought over, Greece is steeped in mythology and medieval culture. On islands such as Lesvos and Chios, you can savour the history, enjoy views of fishing harbours and majestic mansions, and “live the life” with ouzo, olive oil and artisanal products. Tucked in mountain folds, perched on clifftops or gloriously remote and tranquil, here are six of the most scenic and unspoilt villages in Greece. Zagoria, Epirus For adventurers White knuckle: Rafting on the river Aoos, Zagoria In the pine-clad Pindus mountains in Epirus lies a region of exquisite natural beauty, striking geology and varied ecosystems. Carved from stone, Zagoria’s 46 villages with hospitable guesthouses are linked by roads and stone bridges built by 18th-century merchants. To visit is to enter a secret kingdom. Two national parks protect the unique landscape: one features the river Aoos and the Vikos Gorge; the other, Valia Kalda, to the east of snow-capped Mt Tymphe, hosts dense forest, which blazes with autumn colour, plus bears, wolves and eagles. At 3,248ft, Vikos Gorge is one of the deepest in the world and a haven for endangered species. It’s ideal for hiking as a breeze cools the tree-shaded paths even in midsummer. Hike it in two or three parts: from the restored stone village of Monodendri north to Vikos, where the Monastery of St Paraskevi is perched above the ravine; from Vikos to Papingo, and from Monodendri to Kipi. A gentle trail runs from Pápigo to the shelter near the Astráka peak and on to Drakolimni, an alpine lake, which legend says used to be inhabited by dragons. Other must-dos include walking the Vradeto Stairs — 3,937ft of stone steps that until 1973 provided the only access to the village of Vradéto — and visiting the taverns for delicious food. How to get there Year-round flights to Thessaloniki and then a 4hr drive, or seasonal flights to Aktion, Preveza and a 2.5hr drive. Monemvasia, Peloponnese For romantics Village charm: the Byzantine church of Hagia Sophia, Monemvasia Photo: Alamy Spectacular Monemvasia is a perfectly preserved medieval fortress built on a monolithic slab of rock on the east coast of the Peloponnese. Created after an earthquake in AD375 and reached by a narrow causeway, the islet is a stunning sight, a mini rockmountain with sheer cliffs soaring above an aquamarine sea. On a coast redolent of mythological feats, and with excellent beaches, it is great for those seeking to add a little history and light exploration to a summer idyll. After you cross the causeway, the islet’s only entrance is a narrow tunnel in a formidable fortified wall. From the L-shaped tunnel you emerge blindsided into a medieval world built for donkey traffic. A cobbled street leads to the central square and the 13th-century Cathedral of Christ in Chains. Three notable Byzantine churches await discovery, while you can follow a signposted path off the square to the fortress and intriguingly jumbled upper town. How to get there Year-round flights to Athens followed by a 3.5hr drive, or seasonal flights to Kalamata and a 2.5hr drive. Pelion, Central Greece For nature lovers All aboard: The Moutzouris steam train, Pelion Photo: Alamy A panorama from Mt Pelion — mythological land of centaurs, nymphs and warriors — offers views of mountains, forests, islands and beaches. Dotted with picturesque villages, the remote peninsula is best explored by walking the kalderimia, cobbled donkey tracks and ancient paths overgrown with wild flowers. Dot-to-dot your way from one hillside cascade of white houses to another. A gentle three-hour stroll, for example, takes you from Kala Nera, a seaside village full of fountains, to the beautifully preserved settlement of Milies. From there, ride along the slopes of Mt Pelion on the Moutzouris, the oldest railway in the country. Other hikes include Tsagkarada to Damouchari (2 miles) via a cobbled path offering glorious Aegean vistas. A walk from Ano Lechonia to Agios Georgios traverses olive groves and ravines, with a superb view of the Pagasetic Gulf, while the route from Veneto to Ano Kerasia takes you through oak and chestnut trees and ravines to a glade where the historic Monastery of Flamouri stands. How to get there Flights to Athens and a 4hr drive, or seasonal flights to Volos and a 1hr drive. Mastihohória, Chios island For artisan lovers Tranquil delights: tap into a beautiful, peaceful and authentic village tempo in Greece Photo: Alamy The Mastihohória is a collection of medieval villages in southern Chios with a history in controlling the production of mastic, a tree resin once worth its weight in gold. This led to a turbulent history rebuffing invaders and Arab pirates, which is reflected in the villages’ seclusion and fortified character, built out of sight from the sea and surrounded by high walls. In medieval times mastic was valued by sultans’ harems as a breath freshener and was used in cooking, medicine and in chrism, the oil Orthodox churches used for anointing. Today it is an ingredient of various artisanal products such as soaps and liqueurs and to stabilise Turkish Delight or masticgum ice cream. Visitors can try it in mastic liqueurs such as Mastichato, in a confection known as vaníllia, and in sweets, beverages, chewing gum, desserts, breads and cheese. Only 24 mastic villages have stood the test of time. The most impressive remaining fortress towns are Mestá (with its three castle towers, ancient churches and magnificent arch-linked stone houses), Pirgí (with striking black-and-white geometrical decoration), Olympi, Kalamotí, Véssa, Patriká, Vounó, Eláta and Kiní. How to get there Flights to Athens and ferry or onward flight to Chios. Chóra, Folégandros Island For the sophisticated traveller Ideal hideaway: Chora village on the remote rocky island of Folégandros Photo: Alamy With its small hotels, secluded coves and sense of exclusivity, the remote rocky Cycladic island of Folégandros is an ideal hideaway. Its impossibly blue waters offer an underwater paradise for scuba divers, and a boat tour – and special permit – is the only way to discover Crissospilia, a protected cave lined with ancient inscriptions. Chora, the main town, hanging dramatically on the edge of a cliff, is arrestingly pretty with its whitewashed buildings and colourful wooden balconies. The walk from the cemetery to the hilltop church of Panagia provides spectacular views at sunrise and sunset. In the lanes and squares of the medieval sector are plenty of tavernas. Join locals in the tiny bar, Mikro, to drink rakomelo, play games and eat cake. Lunch on fried goat’s cheese, octopus with black-eyed beans and courgette croquettes with tzaziki in the walled garden of Pounda. Walks on stone-paved donkey tracks lead to gorgeous spots for swimming, or you can take a bus or boat to the beaches. The finest is sandy Angali, with sea sports, umbrellas and sun beds for rent. The sand and pebble beach of Agios Georgios, partly shaded by tamarisk trees, is also a lovely spot. Take a path from the Church of Agios Andreas in Ano Meria. How to get there Flights to Athens or seasonal flights to Santorini, followed by ferry to Folegandros. Molyvos, Lesvos Island For foodies Foodies' paradise: Cuisine of Molyvos Photo: Foodstock Fresh baby sardines from Kalloni Bay, marinated in sea salt and nibbled with a glass of locally produced ouzo. A plate of cheese: soft and stringy kasseri, briny feta and the trademark ladotyri. Spicy aubergine, sfougato (omelette with courgettes), sougania (stuffed onions), chickpeas with mutton, ouzatoi meatballs (with ouzo), and giouzlemedes (fried cheese pies). Molyvos, with its scenic harbour, is a foodie’s paradise, the place to try the unique flavours of Lesvos. The island produces the finest brands of ouzo, the national liqueur, which goes best with several small plates of mezedes – salad, broad beans, stewed meat and vegetables, sweetbreads, meatballs, fried fish and so on. Its more than 11 million olive trees produce top-quality oil. Visit a harbour fish restaurant and watch as boats unload their catch. Or cycle through the olive groves; for four months from the end of October harvesting is done by hand, using donkey transport. Molyvos and Lesvos offer something for everyone: beaches, bird watching, yoga, sailing, scuba diving and horse riding. How to get there Flights via Athens and direct seasonal flights.
