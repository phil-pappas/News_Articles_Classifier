The multi-million dollar boutique hotel, The Island House, recently opened in southwest Nassau.\nThe Island House is a luxurious extension of Mahogany House – a popular restaurant among locals and international visitors. The new hotel features 30 rooms, a spa, an 82-foot lap pool, two squash courts, a movement studio, a tennis court, a gym, a movie theatre and three restaurants.\nSocial Coordinator of The Island House, Keisha Taylor, said she believes The Island House is a different offering from any other hotel in Nassau “What’s different about The Island House is that it is small and intimate. It is a boutique hotel but it still has the luxury side of it and it still has all the amenities of a resort. So it is not just a bed and breakfast. While you are staying here it can just be you and your group but you still have a lot to do,” she said.\nThe Pointe, Nassau – The Pointe, a new waterfront destination in downtown Nassau, is scheduled to open in 2017.\nThe Pointe will consist of 110 condo units, a 200- room hotel, movie theatres, retail shops, a performing arts center, a spa, entertainment venues, at least 14 restaurants, a marina and a parking garage.\nChina Construction America (CCA) acquired the six-acre property for The Pointe in December 2014. The Pointe is entirely funded by CCA. CCA will serve as the sole investor, developer and contractor for the project.\nThe Pointe is a world-class lifestyle and residential development in Nassau, The Bahamas and is scheduled to be completed in 2017. With shopping, restaurants and an array of entertainment, The Pointe is poised to become the region’s most sought-after destination.\nLighthouse Pointe at Grand Lucayan Resort, Grand Bahama Island – Expected to be unveiled late 2015, Lighthouse Pointe at Grand Lucayan is currently undergoing a multimillion dollar enhancement project.

With ocean, island and marina/garden view accommodations, the all-inclusive concept will also feature complimentary Wi-Fi, airport transfers and long-distance phone calls to the United States and Canada.\nWith seven dining destinations available for all-inclusive guests, Lighthouse Pointe at Grand Lucayan will feature an eclectic array of cuisine ranging from mouthwatering Italian and modern Asian to regional Caribbean and traditional American fare.
