I understand there are a lot of young lads in this team and I don’t want to give my place up. I want to play. “I come and work harder every time and I want to make it difficult for the manager to leave me out over the next couple of years.” Does he now fear for his place? “I think you have to,” he said. Such candour was especially striking given that Rooney was speaking as he left Wembley on Tuesday night, barely an hour after scoring the penalty against Switzerland that made him England’s first player to reach 50 international goals. With his hair wet from the post-match shower and his phone buz­zing with congratulatory text messages, Rooney was mentally already on to the next challenge. He drove back to Man­chester with his family on Tuesday and was back in ­training yesterday ahead of playing Liver­pool at Old Trafford on Saturday. “There’s no better game to go into after losing our last match,” he said. “It is a game we have to win.” Although Rooney is now on a run of 22 goals in his past 34 England matches, it is 10 games and five months since he last scored in the Premier League. His team-mates expect this England achievement to spur his club performances. “I think it will inspire him,” Chris Smalling said. “I think we will see a flying Wayne Rooney come Saturday.” Smalling admitted that it had been an emotional experience for the younger players to be part of Rooney’s landmark. “Roy Hodgson had the shirt with the '50’ on it and we were all shouting 'Rooney, Rooney’ so loud it was only a matter of time before he did that speech in the dressing room.” The England captain said he felt “overwhelmed” by the acclaim of his team-mates and admitted that nerves had earlier ensured that he went simply for power on his ­penalty. “I just thought 'put your boot through the ball’,” he said. The wider question, of course, is just how much more Rooney can achieve. Gary Lineker is now third on the England goalscorer’s list but, perhaps conscious that his own ­international career ended rather abruptly at the age of 32, stressed that longevity was unpredictable. “You never know how long a player has left, especially with stri­kers,” Lineker said. “Once you turn 30 as a striker you are usually on the way down but, as a player who is not entirely reliant on pace, you would hope he’s got a few years left. Playing from the age of 16 at such a high level has to take its toll but physically he is very strong and you would hope he can make it to the next World Cup. “We’ve got no one anywhere near so the record going to last at least 10 years. He could put it, not out of sight, but into the sixties.” One England record that Rooney continues to chase is Lineker’s tally of 10 in major tournament finals. Lineker said: “I hope he does ­because that would suggest ­England are doing well, which is long overdue. It’s never quite happened for him at a tournament since Euro 2004. He’s gone in injured or the team has been awful.” In explaining those displays, Lineker points to historic issues in player development but he does ­regard Rooney as the closest Englishman in recent times to the greats of world football. “There’s an element of luck and you also need the right youth development to bring them through, which we’ve only got right the last handful of years,” he said. “Before that we had not a clue what we were doing, which is why we’re playing catch‑up on the rest of the world now.” Rooney and Lineker have been working together in recent months on a BBC documentary which will provide rare access to the England captain’s family life. Lineker, who is also a BT Sport presenter, believes that the programme will be transformative in helping people get to know Rooney. “It will be revelatory and it will transform the public opinion of him,” he said. “I think he comes over honestly and frankly. We don’t get a glimpse into footballers’ personal lives, and this film certainly does that. I think it will be a real eye-opener. He’s a decent guy with a lovely family and I think that comes across.” TelegraphSportPage Follow @telefootball Telegraph Fantasy Football 2015/16 Get your first team free. £100,000 to be won Pick your free team »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:35:44.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
