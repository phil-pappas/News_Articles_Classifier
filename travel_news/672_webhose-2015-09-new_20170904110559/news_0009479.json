Gear and Gadgets \nNPW Shower Caps are $6.50 at www.rickysnyc.com. ADVERTISEMENT Gear and Gadgets: Whimsical shower caps \nAdmit it, you’ve always wanted a cupcake-shaped shower cap. How about a duck? If you are still reading, you may be just the kind of playful bather the folks at NPW Design had in mind when they created these refreshing alternatives to the flimsy transparent caps provided in hotel bathrooms (if you’re lucky). \nMade of phthalate-free PVC with an elasticized opening, the caps are available in five whimsical designs: a pink-and-red cupcake topped with a red “cherry”; a bright-yellow duck with a flapping beak; an upside-down ice cream cone with the cone jutting up from sprinkle-coated pink “ice cream”; a green frog with bug-out eyes and a wide smile; and a pink raspberry with a perky green stem. \nKids will love these shower caps (which might even lure resistant tots at bath time), but they are made to fit most adults as well. Wash up with a smile after a grueling travel day. Or add a silly but practical touch to a bon-voyage gift package. \n— Judi Dash", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T00:17:28.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
