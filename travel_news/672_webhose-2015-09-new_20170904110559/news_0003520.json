Earlier, the HR-V earned a TOP SAFETY PICK rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), making it a collision safety leader and standout choice in the growing small crossover market.\n\"Using Honda's packaging magic, powertrain innovation and safety engineering expertise, the HR-V delivers a high level of occupant safety protection along with class-leading fuel economy and interior space,\" said Jeff Conrad , Honda Division senior vice president and general manager. \"True to Honda's commitment to the safety of all road users, the HR-V is designed to make the vehicle more compatible with other vehicles and to help to mitigate injuries to pedestrians in the event of a collision.\"\nBlending the styling of a coupe, and the space and utility of a SUV, the 2016 Honda HR-V utilizes the latest generation of Honda's Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure. The ACE ™ body structure improves frontal crash energy management through a wider range of offset and oblique collision modes. In addition, other body reinforcements work in tandem with the strengthened body structure to better maintain the occupant compartment volume during frontal collisions by providing additional crash energy pathways to help mitigate the forces transmitted to the passenger compartment.\nKey Safety and Driver-Assistive Features:\nIn addition to the application of Honda's ACE™ body-structure, the 2016 HR-V features a host of standard active and passive safety features and offers many standard and available driver-assistive technologies, such as:\nSmartVent® Front Side Airbags Side Curtain Airbags with Rollover Sensor Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren (LATCH) Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) with Traction Control Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering (EPS) Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) Honda LaneWatch® (EX, EX-L Navi) Hill Start Assist (HSA) Expanded View Driver's Mirror Multi-Angle Rearview Camera with Guidelines Standard safety equipment on all 2015 Honda models includes ACE™ body structure, Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) with traction control; an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS); side curtain airbags; dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbags; and front side airbags.\nHonda Safety Leadership\nHonda has a long history of leadership in the development and application of advanced technologies designed to enhance the safety of all road users, including automobile occupants, motorcycle riders and pedestrians. The company operates two of the world's most sophisticated crash test facilities, in Ohio and Japan , and is responsible for numerous pioneering efforts in the areas of crashworthiness, airbag technology, collision compatibility and pedestrian safety. The company is broadly applying advanced driver-assistive technologies such as LaneWatch™, Forward Collision Warning and Lane Departure Warning to its product lineup and has applied rearview cameras as standard equipment to 100-percent of its line-up for 2015.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140415/73520\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2016-honda-hr-v-achieves-highest-overall-score-for-collision-safety-from-the-national-highway-traffic-safety-administration-300141407.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20140415/73520", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2016-honda-hr-v-achieves-highest-overall-score-for-collision-safety-from-the-national-highway-traffic-safety-administration-300141407.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140415/73520", "http://automobiles.honda.com/hr-v/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA99247&Transmission_Id=201509110900PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA99247&DateId=20150911"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T20:35:08.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
