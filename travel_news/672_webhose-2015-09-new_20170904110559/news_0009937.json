Thermometers that read in the 100s across the Central Valley are expected to read in the lower 80s by Monday, certainly a noticeable and welcome change. \nLast week and this week will have quite the contrast in the West, with temperatures dipping below average for the first time since the beginning of September in some locations. \nExceptional drought and the recent stretch of scorching heat has caused problems, including turning California into a tinder box. Many fires are currently raging across the state, including the Butte Fire, which exploded in growth early on Friday, and the Valley Fire, which began on Saturday afternoon. \nThe Butte fire has burned more than 65,000 and the fire is only 25 percent contained as of Sunday night, according to the California government website. \nA state of emergency was declared in Amador and Calaveras counties on Friday as thousands were forced to evacuate after the fire threatened and burned homes near the town of San Andreas. Over 200 buildings have already been destroyed by the fire as of Sunday night, Over 6,000 structures are threatened as nearly 500 fire engines and thousands of fire personnel battle the blaze. \nThe Valley Fire began on Saturday afternoon and had already burned 25,000 acres by Sunday night. Mandatory evacuations were in place for parts of Napa and Lake counties. \nThis out-of-control fire has already burned the communities of Middletown and Hidden Valley Lake. Four firefighters were sent to the hospital Saturday with second-degree burns, according to the Associated Press. \nThe fire is still zero percent contained as of Sunday night. \nAccording to the USDA Forest Service, 40 large fires are currently burning across the West. Five states are dealing with these dangerous blazes and they include California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. \nThe Rough Fire east of Fresno is threatening to sweep through an ancient grove of Giant Sequoia trees, according to the Associated Press. This lightning-caused fire is only at 36 percent containment as of late Sunday as firefighters rush to get it under control. \nWhile the weekend will end warm, the drop in temperature this week will help firefighters battling the blaze in some ways, but also could hurt efforts in other ways. The unsettled weather may bring some rain to parts of the West, although thunderstorms could cause more wildfire problems due to lightning. \n\"Anytime a cold front pushes through the west during the fire season, problems ensue,\" AccuWeather Meteorologist and firefighter Evan Duffey said. \nDuffey noted that cold fronts usually bring stronger and sometimes unpredictable winds that could rapidly spread fire, making it hard for incident managers to position teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:15:33.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
