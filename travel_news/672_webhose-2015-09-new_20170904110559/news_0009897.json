Kirsten Hodgson was exploring Laos with her boyfriend when she was robbed. Source: Supplied \nEVERY week, an average of 19 Australians are robbed overseas with many having their holidays plunged into chaos as a result. \nThat’s according to statistics from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), which provided assistance to more than 1000 Aussies throughout the last financial year for cases of theft. Most of them occurred in Europe. \n“The top five countries where Australians reported thefts while travelling abroad were France, Spain, Germany, Italy and Mexico,” a DFAT spokesperson told news.com.au. \nAnd these figures don’t include the theft of passports — which is also a huge problem in Europe. \n“During the same period, Australians reported more than 2600 passports as being stolen overseas. The top five countries (for stolen passports) were Italy, US, France, UK and Spain.” \nSadly, a new survey of Australian travellers by Travel Insurance Direct (TID) has also uncovered a high number of cases — with one in eight respondents reporting having been robbed or scammed at some point while abroad. \nTwo of their respondents, Kirsten Hodgson and Luke*, have shared their stories to show just how quickly things can go wrong. \nWhile such cases often cause financial headaches, they can also be traumatic especially when threats — or acts — of violence are involved. \nKIRSTEN’S STORY \nAfter spending a drama-free three months travelling around Asia with her boyfriend, Ms Hodgson considered herself ‘travel savvy’. But one day while walking down a main street in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, her bag was cut off her in a brazen public attack. \n“I was walking closest to the road, a habit of mine, and I had my bag the way I always wore it; strung across my body with the main part of the bag at the front so I could access it easily and keep an eye on it,” 28-year-old Ms Hodgson said. \n“Suddenly a motorbike turned the corner and appeared in front of me, I felt myself being shoved backwards and punched in the chest. Before I knew it one of the guys had cut my bag with a knife and pulled it straight off me. \n“I screamed and we both tried to run after them but they were already too far up the road.” \nMs Hodgson said the incident made her feel shocked, and ill. \n“Having something stolen from you is an awful feeling but to have it ripped away from you is so much worse. Not only did I instantly feel nauseous, I also felt violated.” She felt violated by the robbery. Source: Supplied \nThe next step was assessing the financial damage. \n“Fighting the overwhelming urge to scream, cry and hit something, we spent the next few minutes hurriedly trying to recall exactly what I had in my bag. I knew our passports were safe as we always kept them in the hostel, but unfortunately the same could not be said for my phone, wallet and money. \n“To make matters worse it wasn’t until we arrived at the police station that I realised all of our bank cards were in the bag too.” \nThe duo contacted their parents to ask them to send through some emergency money. \n“On top of waiting for the money, we also had to wait weeks for new cards to be ordered before we could carry on as normal, missing out on quite a few things because we simply couldn’t afford it.” \nShe said they were lucky to have had help from locals including a woman who saw her bag being stolen and paid for them to get a tuktuk to the police station before inviting them around for dinner that evening. \n“The silver lining (if any) was that the incident taught us a memorable lesson about travel money and our valuables. From then on we made sure we had two bank cards and kept them separate so that we always had a back-up if one went missing, the same applied to any cash we carried. Never again.” \nLUKE’S STORY \nLuke and his friend Matt were walking along a quiet street near Rio’s famous Ipanema Beach at about 9pm when they were robbed at knifepoint. \n“I had read that the beach wasn’t that safe late at night, but we were on the opposite side of the road and walking alongside expensive apartment buildings,” he said. “Three local teenage boys, probably all around 16 years old, ran towards us from the beach side of the road. Luke and Matt at Sugerload Mountain in Rio. Source: Supplied \n“They surrounded us and two of them showed us wooden handled kitchen knives that they held against their chests. The other guy held something wrapped in a plastic bag as a weapon. We weren’t sure if this was also a knife or something harmless that he pretended was a weapon. \n“We couldn’t understand their Portuguese but it was pretty obvious they wanted our cash.” \nThey grabbed James’ wallet and removed about 150 Brazilian Reals (approx. $60) but luckily gave the wallet back, as it contained bank and ID cards. \nMeanwhile, Nick handed a more nervous member of the group 40 Reals ($16) that was sticking out the side of his wallet \n“Satisfied, the three ran back across to the beach area, leaving us feeling pretty shocked and full of adrenaline. We felt pretty bitter about the experience.” The experience left them more wary.

Try to keep your credit card in sight to ensure your details are not copied. Avoid using ATMs that open onto the street and instead use ATMs in controlled areas such as banks, shops and shopping centres.” \nIt also warns of robbery and extortion occurring in unauthorised taxis, so only used official taxi companies where possible that can be booked by phone or at major hotels or airports. \nMichelle Hutchison, money expert at Finder.com.au has some general advice for tourists on avoiding theft: \n• Report the theft to the local police in the same location as the theft took place. While it may or may not help you get your money back, having it documented will help with your travel insurance claim. \n• Call your bank’s emergency hotline and have your cards blocked. You can also request an emergency card or, in some cases, a cash advance to get you through your trip. \n• Cash is king, so make sure you always have access to some. When withdrawing money overseas, do so in reasonable amounts so you don’t have to pay ATM withdrawal fees each time you need cash. \n• Split up your money options. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket and consider using prepaid travel cards, credit cards and cash. This is a safer action plan and alleviates pressures in the case of theft. One perk of having a prepaid travel card is that it is not linked to a bank account, therefore can provide extra security. \n• Use the hotel safe, for added security and peace of mind. \n• Before you leave for your holiday, make several hard copies of your cards and identification; email them to yourself, leave copies in your suitcase as well as with someone back home. \n• Also, let your banks or providers know that you’ll be overseas and how long you’ll be travelling for. It may help them act quickly following any dodgy transactions. \n• Take out comprehensive travel insurance. \nOTHER FINANCIAL DRAMAS AUSSIES HAVE ENCOUNTERED \nRobberies are just the tip of the iceberg when it come to financial dramas experienced by Australians while overseas, according to research by TID ahead of the launch of their new travel money card. \nA staggering 70 per cent of the 1000 Australians they surveyed reported having experienced a problem accessing their funds or having been charged an exorbitant fee, or bad exchange rate, while travelling. \nMeanwhile, one in 10 said foreign fees and charges amounted to more than $100 on their last trip. \nIf you’re in trouble overseas, the 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre in Canberra can be contacted for assistance from anywhere in the world on +61 2 6261 3305 or 1300 555 135 if in Australia. \n* Last name withheld upon request.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T10:03:25.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
