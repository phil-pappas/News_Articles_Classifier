The Telegraph Media Group has long recognised that students of science, technology, engineering and mathematics are the people who will one day change the world. Building on the success of the 2014 and 2015 Telegraph UK STEM Awards, we’re bringing together five challenges in five key sectors, in partnership with leading employers. Here, you can find out more about the entry process, get answers to commonly asked questions, and hear exclusively from some of last year’s winners. How do I enter? Entering the Telegraph UK STEM Awards is straightforward, and you can do it online. First, you need to decide which of the five categories you’d like to enter, and find out more about the relevant challenge at telegraph.co.uk/stemawards . These are your options: Design in the built environment Sponsored by Atkins Energy Sponsored by Semta Healthcare Sponsored by GSK Innovation Sponsored by McLaren Aerospace Sponsored by Rolls-Royce You have from now until 15 February, 2016 to fine-tune your application and submit it. Each sponsor company will then shortlist the most impressive entries within its category, and these students will be asked to present their ideas in person. The confirmed category winners – one for each of the STEM challenges – will then be invited to London to present their idea to our panel of expert, independent judges. The final decision will be announced at an awards ceremony in London in June 2015, where the overall winner will be presented with a cheque for £25,000. In the meantime, make the most of the next few months to perfect your idea. Visit the STEM Awards online hub for the latest STEM news and interviews, plus expert advice and tips on how to optimise your entry for a greater chance of success.
