Source: News Corp Australia \n“We are developing recipes under the ‘Crafted by Curtis’ title that will be spread across the main dining room across the entire fleet and will be representative of where you are cruising,’ he says. \n“So if you are cruising in the Carribean they will have a Carribean inspiration or Japan, obviously an Asian influence. \n“The second layer are restaurants at sea called ‘Share’ which will feature menus of my signature dishes that are, obviously, designed to share and maybe take you out of your comfort zone.” \n“We’re also doing a special Chef’s table too which is a bit fancy, caviar and a real behind-the-scenes experience. \n“I always use the example of Las Vegas when it comes to cruising,’’ says Curtis. \n“Vegas used to be cheap, $5 dollar buffets but now it is three-star Michelin chefs and of course there are still less expensive alternatives, but cruising, like Vegas has come the full circle.” \nInternationally known, Melbourne-born Curtis began his cooking career at the age of 18 in Australia and later honed his skills at Michelin-starred restaurants in London. Cool, crisp and understated: many cruising restaurants have totally changed from the way they used to be Source: \nHe has appeared on a number of top-rated cooking programs, most recently starring as a mentor on the US Food Network’s All-Star Academy and is host of the Network’s show, Beach Eats \nKnown for his ‘fresh’ approach to food, Curtis says he has teamed with a company who he thinks is the best and has the same aesthetic. \n“Princess are the best of the best when it comes to food as they have a great attitude to sourcing the best of fresh food,’’ he says. \n“Food and travel go hand in hand in my book so when you are travelling you want to eat well because you have time to do it too,’’ he adds. \nAustralians will be among the first holiday-makers in the world to experience the new Crafted by Curtis items when they debut next month on Golden Princess, which will be arriving in Sydney on October 18 for her maiden season of cruising down under. Golden Princess will be based in Melbourne from the end of October through to April 2016. \nMeanwhile Curtis’ first restaurant at sea, Share, will be unveiled in Australian waters next April on-board the local Princess ship, Sun Princess. The look of ‘Share’: the new Curtis Stone culinary experience, soon on board Princess Cruises Source: \nFor foodies, you’ll be pleased to know the Share menu features dishes like a charcuterie starter course; butter roasted lobster with caramelised endive and endive foam; twice cooked duck leg with fennel, bacon jus and parmesan crumb; tagliatelle with roasted Alaskan crab, chilli and parsley; and dark chocolate cremeux with toasted hazelnut heuilletine and burnt vanilla bean ice cream. \nDiamond Princess arrived in Sydney early Tuesday after a season in Asia with her Sydney arrival marking the official start of the Australian summer cruise season, which will be the largest on record. \nAt 116,000 tonnes, the 290-metre long Diamond Princess is one of the biggest ships to be based in Australia this summer and will be cruising around Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific.

Pacific Princess will also visit Australia in 2016 as part of her world cruise.
