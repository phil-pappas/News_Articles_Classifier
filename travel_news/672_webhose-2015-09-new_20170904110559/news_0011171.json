Two blood moons, in 2014 and 2015, point to dramatic events in the Middle East and, as a result, changes in the whole world.”\nAccording to Wikipedia, the “idea of a blood moon serving as an omen of the coming of the end times comes from the Book of Joel, where it is written ‘the sun will turn into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes’.\n“This phrase is again mentioned by Saint Peter during Pentecost, as recorded in Acts, although Peter says that date, not some future date, was the fulfilment of Joel’s prophecy.”\nLast month NASA shot down reports that appeared on alternative news sites claiming an asteroid would hit Earth on September 28 , “wiping out most of the Americas”.\nMr Blitz agrees the asteroid story was rubbish; he says the end will instead be heralded by the mother of all earthquakes.\n“The number has more than doubled over the last 10 years,” he told his devotees recently.\n“It was prophesied that there would be earthquakes at increased levels before the return of the Messiah and they were to be likened to birth pangs.\n“With the increase in activity and the increase in magnitude I definitely see it as being but another sign along with the signs in the heavens that we are at the door.”\nMr Blitz uses another blood moon reference that appears in Verse 12 of the Book of Revelation, to support his theory: “And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood ...”\nBoth ministers warn that it will be on this day that the dreaded Four Horsemen of the Acocalypse reveal their individual missions.\nJust to scare you, here is a map of seismic activity around the world so far this month Source: Supplied\nMORMONS ARE FREAKING OUT TOO\nMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints have been stewing over the end of the world for months thanks to popular Mormon author Julie Rowe.\nLast year, Rowe published back-to-back books in which she described a series of visions she claims she had during a near-death experience in 2004.\nThe books, which urge people to “unify in righteousness and continue to build a righteous army” in preparation for the end of the world, have flown off the shelves in the Mormon heartland of Utah.\nBut church elders have distanced themselves from the mother-of-three, declaring her work was not in line with traditional teachings.\nWhile neither of Rowe’s books contain a specific date for the end of the world, she appears to endorse the Blood Moon Prophesy and the significance of the Jewish tetrad during public appearances.\nRowe tells devotees that significant events happen in seven year blocks. For example, in 2008, seven years after 9/11, the stock market crashed, leading to a devastating recession. Fast forward seven years to the present day and Wall Street has been fluctuating wildly in the wake of China’s currency devaluation.\nShe believes that September 13, the start of the Jewish High Holy Days, marked the beginning of a terrible cycle that brings on an even larger financial crisis, based on the United States’ “wickedness.”\nThat event would launch the “days of tribulation” described in the Bible.\nMany Mormons have expressed fears that a major earthquake will strike Utah on the night of the blood moon. Others reportedly anticipate a military invasion, technological disruptions and general chaos and hysteria.\n“Mormons have traditionally been asked by the church to keep emergency supplies on hand, which come in handy in emergencies, but this run on supplies is because some people truly believe September 28 is the end,” one local observed.\nLast week, reports emerged of Mormons “stockpiling food” ahead of the blood moon.\n“Mixing a brew of biblical prophecies, the Hebrew calendar, a volatile economy, world politics, and astronomical occurrences, hordes of Utahns have become convinced calamitous events are imminent — maybe by month’s end — and are taking every precaution,” Peggy Fletcher Stack of The Salt Lake Tribune reported.\n“They are called ‘preppers’ and are buying up food-storage kits, flashlights, blankets and tents. Some are even bracing to leave their homes, if need be.”\nOne local shop which specialises in freeze-dried goods, reported a 500 per cent increase in sales over the past two months.\n“There is a sense of urgency, like something is up,” customer-service representative Ricardo Aranda told the paper.\n“A lot of people are mentioning things about September, like a financial collapse.”\nAnother local salesman, Jordan Jensen, said sales had also shot up at his survival supplies store.\n“It’s crazy busy,” he said. “(Our) 72-hour emergency kits are almost impossible to keep on the shelves. We get a shipment every day.”\nYoung Mormons in Hildale, Utah watch as workers clean debris off of a bridge area after flash flooding on Tuesday.
