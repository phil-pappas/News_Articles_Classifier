Of course, any hotel is only as good as its immediate surroundings, and the Tahiti scores well there. To see it in the best light, you should book a room with a sea view. You’ll see not just the Mediterranean, but a sweeping shoreline that bends around in the arc of a peninsula, with another hotel at the far end of it. It looks for all the world like something out of a North African Foreign Legion base.\nLOCATION: The rooms may not be quite in the luxury bracket, but the balconies with views of the sea and not-far-away Ibiza (half an hour by ferry) compensate. There is good air-conditioning and generous supplies of soft drinks provided in the fridge daily.\nDINING: Breakfast is one of the hotel’s most winning attributes. The key element – apart from an excellent variety of food, plus sparkling wine for those who fancy alcohol at that hour – is that you can sit down for the first meal of the day at any time until noon (when of course you don’t need to be so furtive about pouring out the vino).\nFend off early morning hunger pangs and arrange an excursion –a beach walk, a stroll along the local lake shore, or a bike ride. Then, eat your heart out before noon on a meal that by then resembles a hearty lunch. No need for more food till evening!\nSERVICE: Apart from alfresco snacks at a pop-up restaurant, the hotel doesn’t really “do” evening meals – although there is a nice bar (also in the open air) where you can get such delights as croissants filled with salmon and soft cheese and delicious cakes. But the hotel owns a nearby restaurant, Tahiti Beach - and an extremely friendly “People” beach bar serving food and drinks just a short stroll along one of the island’s many wooden gangways that run parallel to some of the beaches. There is also an excellent (and equally friendly) restaurant next door to the hotel, the Bocasalina, which is not part of the Tahiti empire. For guests who prefer not to swim in the sea (jellyfish can sometimes be a problem). the hotel has a spacious swimming pool. You can order snacks and cocktails too.\nRATING: 4 stars\nDOWNSIDE: Sometimes the pool is dominated by youngsters diving in and improvising their own water sports, which rather spoils it for adults who want a peaceful, relaxing swim without being splashed. The hotel will tell you that no diving is allowed. They really ought to put a sign up making this clear to those noisy aquatic teenagers.\nAstbury Formentera www.formentera.co.uk specialise in offering different room types (accommodation only or bed and breakfast) and can organise transfers.\nMore on thestar.com\nShould we circumcise our baby boy?
