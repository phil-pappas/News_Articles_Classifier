It was, as you’d expect, a fairly decadent, blessed upbringing. Some of the little moments of the Queen’s childhood were were strict and regimented for a purpose beyond just bringing her up nicely and turning her into a nice little girl. She was, of course, being primed for a lifetime of being a monarch. Now, she is the longest-reigning monarch . But perhaps - just perhaps, putting aside the notion that none of us will ever be head of state - some of the lessons learnt by Elizabeth could be learned by our children and grandchildren today. Can we teach them the queenly ways? Queen Elizabeth II's life and times Born in 1926, she was brought up by her nanny. Nanny was called Clara ‘Allah’ Knight, and her direction was influenced not by the Queen Mother, but by Queen Mary , Elizabeth’s grandmother. Photo: Hulton Archive Queen Mary's grandmothering had a couple of diktats attached. One of them was that Elizabeth must be taught to wave and smile. She wasn’t allowed to fidget either. Photo: AFP Nanny believed that if you spoilt children then you would ruin the adult to come, and so everything was run on a strict schedule, preparing her well for her timetabled excursions now. Photo: AFP Although she was shy outside her family circles, as she grew older, this wore off. With her sister Margaret , she was quite the enthusiastic performer. Photo: AFP At home, the princesses had bicycles and pets, including two grey ponies and the first of the many corgis that Elizabeth would go on to own over the course of her life. Photo: Apic The training that nanny, via Queen Mary, put in paid off. Elizabeth learnt how to wave adequately. Photo: Hulton Archive And her love of corgis never faltered, either.

Now, kids, don't fidget! @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T12:33:23.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
