Newcomer ... Qatar Airways is tipped to announce direct flights to Doha from Sydney soon. Picture: News Corp Australia Source: News Limited \nDeputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the extra flights would be a boost for the tourism industry, and cater for growth in the Australia-Qatar and Australia-Europe routes. \n“Under our air services arrangements with Qatar, airlines can also operate unlimited services between Qatar and regional locations such as Darwin, Adelaide, Gold Coast and Cairns,” said Mr Truss. \nTourism Minister Richard Colbeck said the Qatar deal would “strengthen aviation links with the region, and support the Government’s Tourism 2020 strategy by facilitating greater visitor numbers from the Gulf”. \nBut the deal is likely to put pressure on Qantas and partner Emirates who jointly fly thousands of Australians to Europe via Dubai, and the Virgin Australia-aligned Etihad which provides services through Abu Dhabi. Luxury ... Qatar Airways has won numerous awards for its level of cabin luxury.

Competition ... Emirates could lose some of its hard fought market share when Qatar Airways takes on a bigger role in the Australian market. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nIn June this year, the Doha-based airline was named the world’s best carrier in the annual SkyTrax awards in recognition of the attention to detail from the front of the aircraft to the rear. \nIts economy seats are lauded as among the roomiest and most comfortable in the world, and each passenger can access 2000 entertainment options on individual screens. \nIn Business and First Class, passengers enjoy meals designed by acclaimed chefs Nobu Matsuhisa and Vineet Bhatia. First Class comfort ... How the pointy end looks on a Qatar Airways’ aircraft. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nAviation expert Neil Hansford said Qatar Airways had the money to provide a “seriously good service”. \n“Qatar has 60 per cent of the world’s natural gas, it’s another cash box,” said Mr Hansford. \n“But I don’t think Doha has anything like the tourist appeal of Dubai.” \nHe said Australian travellers would benefit most from the additional capacity and the extra competition Qatar Airways would provide. \n“I’m surprised they’ve taken this long to come to Sydney,” he said. \nHow the carriers compare", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T23:12:54.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
