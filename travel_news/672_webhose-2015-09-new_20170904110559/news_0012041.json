The online travel magazine is advising people to use comparison sites such as UK Airport Car Parks ( http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk ), to find the best deals available.\nNewspapers around the world have recently reported the UK being one of the most expensive places to park a car at an airport. Even though this has become big news, consumers using airport parking facilities in the UK are still not using comparison sites to find the best deals. That is resulting in holidaymakers wasting a great deal of money when they could save up to 60%.\nOne of the biggest problems when it comes to booking airport parking is consumers are unaware there are options available to find cheaper parking. According to Sun Holiday Reviews, when a holidaymaker looks at putting their car in an airport parking facility, they pay the first price that is offered to them. Even though the majority of people use comparison sites for mortgages and insurance, fewer people use them for saving money on airport parking.\nUK Airport Car Parks (http://www.ukairportcarparks.co.uk/car-parking/robinhood) has become one of the leading airport comparison sites in the UK. They provide consumers with an option to search through all the airport car parking companies and find the best deals online. Consumers can save up to 60% off the normal price of parking a car at an airport.\nChantelle Ellis from Sun Holiday Reviews said: “It is important when looking to book an airport car parking facility to choose a comparison site such as UK Airport Car Parks to find the best deal.”\nIt only takes less than a minute to compare the prices of all the UK’s Airport car parks. Through using an airport comparison site, it can help consumers use the money saved on extras for their holiday.\nTo learn more about Sun Holiday Reviews magazine, please visit http://sunholidayreviews.com/\nAbout Sun Holiday Reviews\nSun Holiday Reviews provides information on holidays, holiday reviews, discounts and the latest travel news.\nMedia Contact\nChantelle Ellis\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
