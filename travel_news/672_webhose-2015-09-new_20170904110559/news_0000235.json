Options to consider include hotels that occupy their own little get-away-from-it-all island, or have quaint cottages hidden away in lush gardens, or come with suites equipped with private plunge pools. Unless otherwise stated, package prices given in the following sections are per person for seven nights in low season, based on two people sharing the cheapest accommodation, and including direct economy flights and transfers. For direct bookings, rates given are for accommodation only, per night for the cheapest double room. 1. Jade Mountain, St Lucia Of St Lucia’s many romantic boltholes, the most striking is Jade Mountain ( jademountain.com ). It’s a futuristic, hilltop lair with gigantic, open-plan bedrooms, called sanctuaries, that bask in mesmerising views through “missing” fourth walls of the island’s green Pitons erupting out of the sea. The rooms are free of technology – the idea is you should focus your attention on your partner – and most have their own iridescent-tiled infinity plunge pools. Booked through ITC Luxury Travel (01244 355527; itcluxurytravel.co.uk ): from £3,657 including breakfast in a Sky Jacuzzi Suite. Fred Mawer 2. Ti Kaye, St Lucia In my opinion, Ti Kaye ( tikaye.com ) is St Lucia's best, affordable love nest. It's in a magical, isolated clifftop spot on the island's west coast, and the simple but pretty gingerbread cottages have open-air garden showers, and hammocks and rocking chairs on terraces to take in the spectacular ocean views. There's an enticing little cliff-hanging spa, and steps descend to Anse Cochon, a pristine, often virtually empty silver-sand beach. Booked through Tropical Sky (01342 886534; tropicalsky.co.uk ): from £1,119 including breakfast. Fred Mawer • St Lucia travel guide Guana Island, British Virgin Islands (Alamy) 3. Guana Island, British Virgin islands How about this for seclusion and privacy? A cottage on Guana Island, itself a private island in, well, the British Virgin Islands. Guana Island ( guana.com ) is part nature reserve and part ultra-low density villa resort, with its cottages ranged on the heights for the spectacular views. It’s a perfect honeymoon hideaway – or take the whole island and stage a wedding. Turquoise Holidays (01494 678400; turquoiseholidays.co.uk ) can offer a week on Guana Island from £2,699, with international flights via Antigua with speedboat transfers, all meals and selected activities. James Henderson • British Virgin Islands travel guide 4. Nisbet Plantation Beach Club, Nevis, St Kitts & Nevis Lush and sleepy little Nevis is just the place for a low-key, lovey-dovey escape. Stay at Nisbet Plantation Beach Club ( nisbetplantation.com ). A former sugar plantation, it has romantic associations: the English naval hero Horatio Nelson met his wife, Fanny Nisbet, here in the late 1780s. With immaculate lawns, a peaceful beach, well-appointed cottages, an elegant Great House (for dinner) and devoted staff, the hotel ticks many of the boxes required for an idyllic getaway. Booked through Tropic Breeze (01752 880880; tropicbreeze.co.uk ): from £1,599, half board. Fred Mawer • St Kitts travel guide • Nevis travel guide 5. Laluna, Grenada Laluna ( laluna.com ) is my number-one recommendation on Grenada for honeymooners. Tucked in a secluded spot on a hillside directly above a sandy beach, it is intimate (just 16 cottage-like rooms – not luxurious but with four-poster beds and small plunge pools) and has a chilled vibe, with guests hanging out on Indonesian day beds. Other selling points include the good Italian beachfront restaurant, a Balinese-style spa, and a pavilion behind the beach for daily yoga and pilates sessions. Booked through Caribtours (020 7751 0660; caribtours.co.uk ): from £1,835, all inclusive. Fred Mawer • Grenada travel guide Yachts in St Vincent and The Grenadines (Alamy) 6. Petit St Vincent, St Vincent and The Grenadines Reached by a 20-minute boat transfer from Union Island, Petit St Vincent ( petitstvincent.com ) comes with two miles of white-sand beaches – and no TV, phones or Wi-Fi in its 22 spacious stone cottages and villas. This is a place for desert-island romance with privacy assured – if you want room service, you’ll need to raise a yellow flag. Treats include two restaurants, a Balinese-run spa, exhilarating sailing and a Jean-Michel Cousteau Diving Centre. Booked through Caribtours (020 7751 0660; caribtours.co.uk ): from £3,299 all-inclusive, flying via Barbados. Nigel Tisdall • St Vincent and The Grenadines travel guide 7. Le Guanahani, St Barths Overlooking Anse de Grand Cul-de-Sac, the 67-room Le Guanahani ( leguanahani.com ) makes a fine base for discovering the delights of St Barths. Being the island’s largest hotel, it is a good choice for a glamorous wedding with flower-filled grounds, a near-private beach and a spa by Clarins. Designer Luis Pons has given the hotel an elegant new look as part of a four-year, £26m renovation, and a high point is the Mediterranean-inspired cuisine of longstanding executive chef Philippe Masseglia. Booked through ITC Luxury Travel (01244 355527; itcluxurytravel.co.uk ): from £2,595 with breakfast; flying via Antigua. Nigel Tisdall 8. Round Hill, Jamaica Round Hill ( roundhill.com ) is perhaps the most exquisite hotel in the Caribbean, offering classic colonial elegance restyled recently by Ralph Lauren. Look out for Chiaroscuro patterns and rich racing green awnings topped with weathered grey shingle roofs, all offset by the manifold greens of tropical foliage. Effortlessly stylish and ideal for a (not inexpensive) wedding and the honeymoon afterwards. Elegant Resorts (01244 897516; elegantresorts.co.uk ) offers a week at Round Hill from £1,755, room only. James Henderson • Jamaica travel guide 9. Hermitage Bay, Antigua Some couples barely emerge at all from their suites at the reclusive and strikingly beautiful Hermitage Bay ( hermitagebay.com ) in Antigua, but then the hillside cottages, done out in lustrous tropical hardwoods and festooned with tropical greenery, have all you need – a plunge pool, veranda with a view and room service (meals and spa). And the eight beachfront suites? Well, they’re just a hop and a skip into the jade and turquoise sea. Scott Dunn (020 8682 5020; scottdunn.com ) offers Hermitage Bay from £3,116, all-inclusive. James Henderson • Antigua travel guide 10. Young Island, St Vincent and the Grenadines Even arriving on Young Island off St Vincent’s southern shore, is romantic. You make the 200 metre crossing to tropical seclusion in an African Queen-like ferryboat. Cottages are tucked up on the hillside or reached by meandering paths through profuse greenery, dining tables are hidden in tropical arbours and if you climb to the top you can look along the Grenadines, a string a pretty islands. Booked though Caribtours (020 7751 0660; caribtours.co.uk ) Young Island ( youngisland.com ) costs from £1,785, all inclusive.
