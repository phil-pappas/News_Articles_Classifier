The study examined the content of 15,000 questions asked via sli.do’s Q&A tool at international events. \nThe study also revealed that questions beginning with ‘What’ or ‘How’ represented three-quarters of all questions examined, with time-related questions, such as those beginning with ‘When’, receiving an average of 40% more likes via the sli.do system. It was also shown that 82% of questions were asked in the present tense. sli.do CEO Peter Komornik comments: “Audience interaction and audience engagement are absolutely integral to the success of events. With this research we wanted to take a granular look at the anatomy of questions asked by delegates to better understand their concerns and interests and ultimately help planners deliver more engaging events. “The results can be interpreted in a number of ways. Knowing, for example, that longer questions receive the most ‘likes’ might suggest more time needs to be allocated to Q&A sessions to allow a greater depth of discussion. Similarly, we can assume that attendees are looking for actionable tips since ‘What’ and ‘How’ questions were the most numerous. This notion may affect the content of a presentation or lecture.” The analysis was carried out on questions starting with ‘What’, ‘Why’, ‘Who’, ‘When’, ‘Where’ and ‘How’, from public events held globally across the last 36 months.
