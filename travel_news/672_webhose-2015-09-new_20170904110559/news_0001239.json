With more than one third of its three million inhabitants living as nomads, Mongolia is one of the few countries where visitors can still experience a genuine nomadic lifestyle.\nFamily stays offer a glimpse on what it's like to live an itinerant lifestyle and a chance to experience the famous Mongolian hospitality.\n\"You can simply turn up unannounced and the Mongolian household will gladly offer you food, a bed and even tend to your horse,\" says Timur Yadamsuren, local guide and country manager for Intrepid Travel in Mongolia.\nIn fact, they don't believe in locking their gers -- the felt homes they dwell in.\nThey simply leave its door open to allow access to any passersby in need food or a rest.\nLucky visitors may be invited to a private shamanic ceremony in which a traditional healer is said to travel to an alternate reality to communicate with spirits and other beings.\nMany Mongolians still observe such ancient beliefs to this day and often approach a shaman to receive blessings, cures or hints about their future.\nWalking with the dinosaurs\nSouth Gobi's Flaming Cliffs -- Mongolia's answer to the Grand Canyon. Mongolia's also the place where American adventurer Roy Chapman Andrews discovered unhatched dinosaur eggs among other significant finds in the 1920s.\nThe epicenter of this discovery is South Gobi's Flaming Cliffs -- considered one of the world's greatest dinosaur fossil sites.\nIn other parts of the world, such a location might've been kept off-limits to the public.\nNot in Mongolia.\nStanding on the ground where dinosaurs once roamed, it's hard not to be thrilled by the prospect of finding even a small bone fragment on the sandstones.\nDuring our visit our guide lets slip that she knows where to see one.\nWe find it concealed under a small rock at the base of a cliff.\nAfter carefully moving the topsoil using her bare hands, she unearths a fully formed backbone.\nAlthough she admits that it hasn't been verified yet, she's convinced it belongs to a dinosaur.\nWhether it's the genuine article or not, Mongolia may offer one of the closest experiences uncovering dinosaur fossils in the wild.\nAs the sun starts to dip lower on the horizon, its rays cast brilliantly against the rugged sandstones, turning them a vibrant orange.\nThe brilliant sunset is just one of many awe-inspiring moments this country has to offer.", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909114958-beautiful-mongolia-shamanic-ritual-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909115002-beautiful-mongolia-inline-cliff-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909114958-beautiful-mongolia-shamanic-ritual-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909114958-beautiful-mongolia-shamanic-ritual-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909115002-beautiful-mongolia-inline-cliff-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909115002-beautiful-mongolia-inline-cliff-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909114958-beautiful-mongolia-shamanic-ritual-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909114958-beautiful-mongolia-shamanic-ritual-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909115002-beautiful-mongolia-inline-cliff-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909115002-beautiful-mongolia-inline-cliff-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909114958-beautiful-mongolia-shamanic-ritual-full-169.jpg", "http://www.intrepidtravel.com/mongolia?gclid=Cj0KEQjwsb-vBRCLj7TvqpGx_MoBEiQALgFGnlZ5N5XTSnCcmtOZWec1eckYs6WAR_-G_3X86bIVo3waAuly8P8HAQ", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909115002-beautiful-mongolia-inline-cliff-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909115002-beautiful-mongolia-inline-cliff-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150909114958-beautiful-mongolia-shamanic-ritual-medium-plus-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-09T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:15:38.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
