The G4S TravelAware is a smartphone application that can be downloaded onto a traveller’s handset, allowing for two-way communication between the user and their base office – with managers at home able to keep watch for potentially dangerous developments in the relevant location, and deliver a quick warning if the staff member needs to seek immediate sanctuary. G4S says that it can provide instant information, based on ground intelligence, from security teams in over 100 countries across the globe. While it is unclear whether the app would enhance a traveller’s safety in a destination where a discernible risk has already been identified by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and suitable caution advised, G4S claims that its alerts can make a real difference in a quickly changing scenario. • Mapped: Terror threat around the world For now, the TravelAware will only be of concern to companies with operations that take their employees into warzones Photo: GETTY The app has been created in partnership with Swedish firm Global Warning System – whose technology demonstrated its effectiveness in March 2011, when subscribers to an earlier app received warnings of the tsunami which was about to strike Japan, 47 minutes before the wave arrived on the east coast of the country. For now, the TravelAware will only be of concern to companies with operations that take their employees into warzones or unstable states – but it could have future ramifications for more mainstream trips, with insurance firms sure to be interested in the app’s efficacy. • Top 10: unusual holiday destinations where the terror risk is low “This product will completely change the way companies approach the safety of their travelling employees,” says Anne Tiedemann of G4S Risk Consulting. “The unique technology brings location-specific incident alerts to travellers in real time, so employees are safeguarded wherever they are – and, should the worst happen, employers have the information to get their employees to safety.” Telegraphtravel Follow @telegraphtravel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:43:58.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
