Recipients of the 2016 KI Awards will be featured in the popular Kitchen Innovations Pavilion at NRA Show 2016, to be held May 21-24 at Chicago’s McCormick Place.\n“The KI Award has helped IceZone® to be the success that we knew it would become, and it has helped us reach that level much faster than we ever imagined,” said Adam Anthony, Chief Operating Officer for BioZone Scientific International, Inc. and manufacturer of IceZone, which received a Kitchen Innovations Award. “At the NRA Show…our team met with dozens of interested contacts from the largest restaurant chains in the world, many of whom we had unsuccessfully reached out to previously. IceZone® sales have more than quadrupled since IceZone® received the KI Award during the NRA Show.”\nSuppliers can apply for a KI Award at Restaurant.org/Show/KI.
