There are rites of passages aplenty as we grow older, but one that hasn’t been so well recognised is the ‘second wind’. According to a new study, Britons experience a ‘second wind’ of life aged 54. Swimming with sharks is on the over 50s to-do list Photo: Alamy The study of 2,000 adults, conducted by Vauxhall, found that a real sense of YOLO – you only live once – is prominent during our 20s, specifically aged 24, but comes back for another round 30 years later. It’s when we get to 50 that the mental ante is upped, and we begin to try out experiences we hadn’t dared to before. Over 50s are more likely to swim with sharks than willingly show signs of ageing and slowing down. Going scuba diving , taking selfies and signing up to social media are also amongst the activities that we take on as we grow in age, aiming to recapture our youth. The older generation have taken to social media Photo: Alamy And while the older generation are keen to save for future investments , they are using their life savings to pour money into exciting new experiences. The study runs to coincide with Vauxhall’s newly-launched VIVA, the first version of which was brought to our roads 50 years ago. \"Times have changed since the days of hitting 50 and feeling past it,” Denis Chick, communications director of Vauxhall Motors said.

The study also showed that eight in ten of the adults polled said they feel just as young now as they did when they were in their 20s. Over half said that they resent being thought of as being ‘past it’. Cheers! Photo: Alamy ‘This Gran Can’ has put together a list of the top 25 activities that the over 50s are enjoying. Flirting with someone younger, booking big travel trips, and going to Zumba classes are amongst those on the list. But how many float your boat?
