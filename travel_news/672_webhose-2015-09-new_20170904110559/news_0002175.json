Within two years of his arrival, Post wed Anselma Onesimo, an American Indian from Carmel Valley whose father helped build the Carmel Mission where the young couple got married. Nearly a century and a half later, their great-grandson Billy Post single-handedly excavated 100 of those acres with a tractor to create one of the worldâ€™s most popular ecological hotels, Post Ranch Inn. Perched 1,200 feet above the booming surf, Post intentionally designed his retreat to coexist with nature, not chopping down a single redwood tree and hiring local architects and artists to create guest rooms with renewable and recycled materials. Walls of glass look out over dramatic stretches of coastline where fog, sunsets and whales glide by. The 41 guest rooms were designed to blend in to the coastline, fed by solar power and built with repurposed wine-barrel-wood walls and recycled Corten steel. From his studio a mile down the road, painter and sculptor Greg Hawthorne made the Picasso-esque chairs and tables found throughout the property, as well as the metal sculpture of faces in profile at the entrance to Post Ranch Inn.
