(Photo: Horizon Yachts) \nNothing says you’ve arrived more spectacularly than making an entrance on a superyacht (witness the parody video, I’m On a Boat .*) For more than a century, the rich and famous have made a splash with their own yachts, including Hollywood A-listers Johnny Carson, Johnny Depp and Steven Spielberg, musicians Eric Clapton and Bono, and pro golfer Tiger Woods. \nPrivately owned luxury yachts are an invention of the 20th century. Boatbuilders began crafting the first recreational yachts for the ultra wealthy in the early 1900s, although it wasn’t until mid-century that owning a superyacht became a thing, thanks in part to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. \nIn 1954, Onassis, who later married President Kennedy’s widow, Jackie, bought a 300-plus foot Canadian frigate and poured millions into making it the world’s first floating playground for the rich and famous. Onboard the lavish Christina O , Hollywood starlets rollicked with American millionaires, princes, kings and world leaders, setting a new high-water mark for extravagant one-upmanship. USATODAY Cruise ship tours: Christina O \nShipyards that had traditionally built navy and merchant vessels began building luxury yachts during the ‘60s and ‘70s in response to new demand. The megayacht industry expanded and contracted with the world economy, experiencing its lowest ebbs after Black Monday in 1987 and the Great Crash of 2008. Its greatest surge occurred during the late ‘90s IT boom when luxury yachts supersized from 75 feet up to more than 200 feet ( see a list of the biggest ones here ). \nToday’s yachts can exceed 500 feet — and $500 million, giving birth to the term “giga-yacht,” and the supersizing war still rages. The largest giga-yacht to date, Azzam, completed in 2013 by German shipyard Lürssen Yachts, is a whopping 590 feet, the length of two football fields end-to-end. Azzam eclipsed Eclipse, owned by Russian millionaire Roman Abramovich, which held the previous record at 536 feet. \nThese palatial behemoths grow ever more ostentatious, sporting helicopter pads (and hangars), swimming pools, submarines, discos, beauty salons and a belly full of water toys.

The lower deck houses a swim platform for easy water access, the engine room, four or five guest cabins and crew quarters. The main deck sees the most action with the salon, galley, formal dining area and owner’s suite. The upper deck typically has a second salon, an exterior lounging/party deck and the bridge. The largest yachts have additional decks for whatever indulgences an owner can imagine and a builder can create. \nThe vessels roam the world’s waters, often splitting season between the Caribbean and Mediterranean. Most are planing hulls, rising out of the water at cruising speed, which, despite their size, allows them to travel at speeds above 20 knots.

Our photo gallery takes a look at 100- to 140-foot luxury yachts listed for around $10 million. \n*The boat T-Pain boarded to record I’m On a Boat , Never Say Never , a 130-foot Sunseeker Predator, is currently listed for $11.2 million.
