Don't let the soaring temperatures stop your fun. One way to beat the heat is to float along the water on a rafting tour. Choose a tour that floats along the smooth water area of the Colorado River, and since there are no rapids, these tours are suitable for everyone over the age of 4. You can take one of these 1-day tours out of the South Rim daily, but you'll want to book your tour early since they sell out quickly. Begin Your Tour One-day trips start from the airport at Grand Canyon National Park, next to Tusayan, Arizona. There are a few tour options to choose from. The basic version includes a 2 1/2 hour bus ride from the airport to the base of the dam in Glen Canyon. You'll also get transportation to the Grand Canyon Village and Maswik Lodge. If you opt for the deluxe package, you'll go to Glen Canyon by plane instead. The deluxe choice includes a Jeep ride to the legendary slot canyons at Horseshoe Bend, before your float down the river begins. They are an amazing sight you don't want to miss with their bright colors and curved rocks. South Rim River Tours All float tours begin at the base of Glen Canyon Dam on the South Rim. The tour departs about 7am and returns around 5pm, so you'll need to allot the entire day to touring the canyon. You'll ride on a 19-passenger motorized pontoon raft that is stable and safe for kids 4 and older. Each raft is manned by a skilled captain knowledgeable in canyon history. Horseshoe Bend One of the beautiful sights on your trip include scenic Horseshoe Bend. In addition, the raft will stop at a few nice beaches, and at one of them, you can see some interesting Native American petroglyphs. These drawings were made over 800 years ago by Pueblo Indian ancestors. If you pass the beach here, it is difficult to get back to it, so it's best to have a guide like your river pilot. Also, don't forget to bring along your swimsuit because the clear, cool waters of the Colorado River are very inviting on a hot summer day. Swim shoes or comfortable tennis shoes suitable for hiking are important for this trip. Come prepared with sunscreen and a good hat or visor that will protect you from the sun. An extra set of clothing is nice too, so you don't have to wear your wet clothes all the way back to your hotel. Lee's Ferry The final stop on your tour is Lee's Ferry. Once a Mormon settlement and then a fort, this spot marks the line between relaxing float tours and whitewater tours. Lee's Ferry also offers a visit to the Cameron Trading Post. It was established in 1916 and you'll find beautiful Native American crafts here. The trading post boasts a beautiful walking garden with sandstone paths as well as the restaurant and store. You can enjoy these activities while waiting for your ride back to the airport in Tusayan. Stay Cool And See It All A rafting tour is a lot of fun and scenic too. Everyone in the family can enjoy rafting along the smooth water section of the river. The deluxe tours are more expensive, but you should consider buying one since you get the Jeep tour and can eliminate the long drive to the river. Summer is a busy time at the canyon and the rafting tours are very popular and fill up fast, so be sure to book your tour in advance to lock in your seats. \nGrand Canyon expert Lea Fallon is a HUGE fan of Canyon 1-day float tours and recommends readers start here for the best adventures at the lowest price: http://www.grandcanyondaytrips.com/float-trips/   68  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-20T07:12:08.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
