Actually, it’s not my kettle; it’s my wife’s. She bought it because she fell in love with its square, white simplistic design. But while beautiful, it doesn’t let you know when the water is boiling. There is no whistle or automatic shut-off; it just boils and boils and boils. It’s form over function, which is why I hate it. Hiral Sanghavi feels the same way about his clothes. He is part of the husband-and-wife team behind the 15-in-1 BauBax travel jacket that has made headlines worldwide for being a “Swiss army knife” of travel clothing. Before I get into what the jacket does (and it’s a lot of nifty stuff ), I’ll tell you how it all began. Mr. Sanghavi, 29, was studying business at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, and was flying frequently to Berkeley, Calif., where he lives with his wife, Yoganshi Shah, also 29. See More » During the flights, Mr. Sanghavi, a self-identified geek, lamented the fact that his normal clothes didn’t have designated spots for his various gadgets, including an iPad, headphones and an iPhone 6 Plus. So Ms. Shah, who worked at a computer networking company, decided to create a travel jacket that could solve her husband’s problems. The couple sat at their dining table and sketched various ideas, cutting fake pockets out of paper, until they had a mock jacket. Then they found a manufacturer to make a prototype. The resulting bomber jacket would not look out of place in an in-flight shopping catalog or an infomercial ripe for satire. It has individual pockets for a smartphone, passport, sunglasses, blanket, tablet, charger and, let’s not forget, hands. It has special sleeves for a cup, headphones and stylus. There’s even an eye mask built into the hoodie, gloves built into the sleeves, and a neck pillow that inflates like a life preserver. The jacket was really just for Mr. Sanghavi. But they liked it so much that they decided to put the bomber jacket and three iterations — a sweatshirt, a windbreaker and a blazer (for both men and women) — on Kickstarter , hoping to raise $20,000. While the garment may not look like much — it’s basically a bomber jacket made of soft shell polyester fabric with lots of hidden pockets — it struck a chord with the gadget-loving, business-traveling public. It was covered in numerous news-media outlets, including CNN , Time , The Daily Mail and The Economist . It also caught the attention of fashion sites like Cosmopolitan and Refinery29 . And in early September, when the Kickstarter campaign ended, the BauBax jacket had raised $9.2 million from 45,000 people in 81 countries — breaking Kickstarter records as its most-funded piece of clothing and its fourth-most-funded campaign ever. “It is good to have clothing that solves problems you face in day-to-day life,” Mr. Sanghavi said in an interview. You could chalk up the 15-in-1 jacket to being just a fad or a niche product. Maybe it’s like the uti litarian camera vests that old-school photojournalists use in the field. Or a fisherman’s convertible pants, which can go from trousers to shorts with the slide of a zipper. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T12:45:52.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
