Now imagine a posh golf and tennis resort, with upscale dining and estate wines, luxurious lodgings and an indulgent spa. \nBillionaire John Pritzker of San Francisco envisioned both in 2009 when his private equity firm acquired 500-acre Carmel Valley Ranch, a former pear orchard that had opened as a private golf club in 1981 and became a somewhat stodgy resort a few years later. \nDrawing on fond memories of summer camp that punctuated his childhood in Chicago and travel industry expertise gained as son of the founder of Hyatt Hotels , Pritzker quickly began sowing the seeds for a multimillion-dollar, largely nature-based transformation.

A brand-new corral and stables offering horseback trail rides cropped up last summer, along with the first round of spacious, indoor-outdoor treetop suites. An olive grove planted this spring is already fruiting, with plans afoot for pressing olive oil. \nThis summer saw the advent of archery sessions, an “equine perspective” program — focused on relating to horses, rather than riding them — and tours of the new butterfly garden. A handsome adult lap pool and sprawling hot tub also debuted at the River Ranch, the resort’s family-friendly enclave on the valley floor that includes eight tennis courts, bocce courts, a locally sourced cafe and a children’s recreation area. \nNext month will see the release of the Ranch’s first estate Pinot Noir, under the Swing label, named for the resort’s iconic swings that hang from live oak trees; guests can help crush this year’s grape harvest at a special event Saturday, Sept. 19. The Ranch hired respected winemaker Peter Figge — one of a half-dozen designated Ranch “artisans”— to tend the 4-acre sustainable vineyard and produce house wines, and Carmel Lavender’s John Russo to manage the lavender fields and lead tours of the apiaries, built to house the fields’ most frequent visitors. \n“I love watching people experience our vineyard with no hesitation, diving into the plants, and knowing they can taste and experience the natural way the vines behave throughout the year,” Figge said. \nAndrea Weiss , the Ranch’s wildlife expert, said she often stops in the vineyard while leading one of her frequent bird-watching walks or scenic hikes. “Sometimes I sneak a few grapes off the vine to offer the guests,” she said sheepishly. “I tell them about the wine, the lavender, its relationship with the bees, and how our beekeeper is the lavender distiller. ... I admire (Pritzker) for having the vision to make it more than a golf and tennis resort.” \nBeekeeping tours depart from the recently renovated clubhouse of the 18-hole Pete Dye golf course, the only one in Northern California, which Pritzker also has had restored. Between the clubhouse and the hillside main Lodge (the Ranch offers free shuttles) is the terrain of farmer Mark Marino . His large organic herb and vegetable garden with towering sunflowers blooms next to a deluxe chicken coop and salt house, which turns Monterey Bay seawater into salt. All are the site of frequent educational talks — and frequent raids by the Ranch’s executive chef, Tim Wood . Valley Kitchen, his renamed and refurbished restaurant, includes a terrace overlooking the garden, vineyards and golf course. \nWhile Wood recently revamped the menu to showcase even more local produce, meat and seafood, the resort’s signature dish may well be the gourmet s’mores, a free treat offered nightly outside the Lodge. For frequent guest Jackie Broad of Mill Valley, making s’mores is the “hands-down favorite thing to do” of her three children, ages 15, 12 and 9. “It’s an upscale camp version,” she said. “We can’t leave without having at least a half dozen.” \nThe kids also rush to get on the swings when they arrive, “something they’ve done so many times over the years — I even get on the swings sometime,” said Broad, a former senior analyst with Levi Strauss . “As a grown-up, it’s fun to enjoy the simple things. At the Ranch, you can have great wine and food, but there are still ways to connect with your kids and do things you enjoy from your childhood.” \nJeremy Beaver , vice president of a conglomerate in San Jose, decided to get married at the Ranch three years ago, after seeing the first phase of its renovations. He said he has returned “about 30 times” since then, for corporate and personal events, including friends’ weddings. \n“It can be romantic, it can be for kids, it has great food, it’s its own compound,” Beaver noted. “There aren’t a ton of places of like that.” \nJeanne Cooper is a former Chronicle Travel editor. \nIf you go \nCarmel Valley Ranch, 1 Old Ranch Road; Carmel.
