The planned 10,500-acre \"no fishing\" reserve covers about 6 percent of park waters and less than 30 percent of its reefs. \nCritics say the reserve will hurt fishing businesses reliant on the park's waters. Park officials say the reserve will allow the reefs to recover, which will lure bigger fish and enhance the experiences of people snorkeling, diving or viewing the waters from glass-bottom boats. \nA park spokesman says implementation of the reserve depends on funding and staffing. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:17:41.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
