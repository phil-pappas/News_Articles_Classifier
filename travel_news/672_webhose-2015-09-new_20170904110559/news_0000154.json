Sydney, one of the World’s Top Business and Tourist Destinations becomes Qatar Airways’ Third Australian Gateway. \nQatar Airways has announced its highly anticipated daily direct services from Doha to Sydney starting from 1st March 2016, the third Australian city in the Qatar Airways network. Currently, the Doha-based carrier operates daily non-stop flights to Melbourne and Perth with a total of 14 services each week. \nAustralia, with its stunning landscape of idyllic beaches and famous interior, along with its rich history and culture, draws millions of visitors each year. The most populous city of Sydney, with its ocean-side location, sandy beaches, and iconic attractions like the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge is one of Australia’s and the world’s top business and tourist destinations, and Sydney will undoubtedly be a popular addition to Qatar Airways’ rapidly growing network. \nQatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker said: “We are delighted to debut our daily Sydney flights next March. The expansion of our Australia services will undoubtedly boost and strengthen the trade and commercial links that exist between Qatar and Australia, setting the stage for even more robust partnership opportunities in the near future. We look forward to carrying more travellers to and from Australia across our extensive global network and providing them with another world-class experience both on board and on the ground at the state-of-the-art Hamad International Airport in Doha.” \nThe evening departure timings in both directions provide convenient travel times for passengers, and enhance connectivity to attractive business and leisure destinations across Qatar Airways' ever-expanding global network. \n\"We're looking forward to welcoming Qatar Airways to Sydney Airport. As Skytrax's 2015 Airline of the Year, Qatar Airways will provide passengers with a quality product and greater connectivity to destinations around the world,\" said Sydney Airport Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Kerrie Mather. \n\"The new daily service will significantly boost inbound tourism to New South Wales (NSW), as well as create an estimated 3,000 jobs, including 2,500 in NSW, and contribute over $240 million to the Australian economy. Qatar Airways' service will also provide greater air cargo access to the Middle East and the growing Qatar market, which is great for NSW exports.\" \nThe Doha-Sydney daily flights will be operated by the Boeing 777-300 aircraft which offers Qatar Airways’ award-winning in-flight hospitality and luxurious comfort across both cabins. \nThe national airline of the State of Qatar was named the world’s best carrier at the 2015 Skytrax Awards earlier in June, marking the third time the airline has won this coveted accolade. Most recently, the airline was also awarded the ‘Best for Business’ award and named runner-up as the readers’ choice for ‘Leisure Long-haul Travel’ by one of the world’s leading travel publications, Condé Nast Traveller. \nPassengers travelling with Qatar Airways to and from Sydney in Business Class on board the Boeing 777 can enjoy one of the most comfortable fully-flat beds in the sky with 78 inches of seat pitch. In addition, the on-demand à la carte menu service allows Business Class passengers to order anything from the menu at any time during the flight. The aircraft also features the state-of the-art Oryx One entertainment system, with more than 2,000 entertainment options on individual screens in all classes. \nWhen flying with Qatar Airways, passengers can look forward to a convenient and seamless one-stop transfer at the state-of-the-art Hamad International Airport (HIA), home of Qatar Airways. The airport houses one of the world’s largest and most luxurious Business Class lounges – the Al Mourjan Business Lounge, and also has over 40,000 square metres of retail space and restaurants that includes a selection of more than 70 retail and 30 food and beverage outlets. \nHIA also has a fully accessible spa for all passengers with a minimal entrance fee that includes access to the following facilities: a swimming pool, squash courts, sauna and steam rooms. \nOne of the fastest growing airlines in the world, Qatar Airways has experienced rapid growth in just 18 years of operation. Qatar Airways has a modern fleet of 166 aircraft flying to 152 key business and leisure destinations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, North America and South America. \nDaily flights between Doha and Sydney from 1 March 2016 (all times local) Depart Doha QR908 at 20:10, arrive Sydney at 18:05 (next day) Depart Sydney QR909 at 22:20, arrive Doha at 05:05 (next day)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:50:46.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
