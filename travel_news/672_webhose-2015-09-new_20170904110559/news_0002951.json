Sprint said its current spectrum holdings are \"sufficient\" for its current network upgrade plans, however, so it will not be a part of the auction. \n\"Sprint's focus and overarching imperative must be on improving its network and market position in the immediate term so we can remain a powerful force in fostering competition,\" Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in a statement. \"Sprint has the spectrum it needs to deploy its network architecture of the future.\" \nSprint previously sat out on the FCC's AWS-3 spectrum auction earlier in 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T00:11:48.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
