In order to build this tradition of achievement and growth, the Company relies on approximately 16,354 employees. In addition to strong, profitable growth and expanding markets for air travel, another characteristic of GOL’s history has been the use of technology. The Company revolutionized the Brazilian civil aviation sector by concentrating its sales on the Internet and by introducing intelligent web-based check-in, as well as being the first Brazilian company to make the entire check-in procedure possible via mobile phone. \nThe Company remains focused on developing and enhancing its products and services through investments in operations, systems and processes, as well as the launch of products such as GOL+ on all domestic Brazilian routes, offering increased comfort and a better flying experience. As a result, GOL has the largest number of A-seal seats (an ANAC classification standard). \nGOL has a very small percentage of delayed flights, at only 6%, thanks to the continuous improvements made in the check-in process.
