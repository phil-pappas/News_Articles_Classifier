The LIRR has made temporary repairs that officials believe will allow the railroad to operate on a normal schedule through the evening rush hour.\nHowever, as a cautionary note, if the temporary repairs do not hold up, train service status could change at a moment’s notice. Delays and possible train cancelations would be announced in real time via public address systems and multiple digital channels described below.\nCustomers for whom taking a train out of Atlantic Terminal, Brooklyn, would be a feasible alternative are encouraged to consider taking a train from there as an alternative to Penn Station. The potential for delays to trains from Atlantic Terminal is considered much less likely.\nThe LIRR will station additional customer service personnel at Penn Station to assist customers with any difficulties that may arise. MTA New York City Transit will position additional station personnel along the 2 Subway Line Icon3 Subway Line Icon4 Subway Line Icon5 Subway Line Icon and 7 Subway Line Icon lines to be ready in the event of an LIRR service disruption. And will have additional track and signal personnel on hand to assist with orderly train service.\nThis morning, rush hour service had been suspended into and out of Penn Station between about 7:45 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. After service had been restored, residual congestion-related delays continued into the mid-day period.\nSource:- MTA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:19:18.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
