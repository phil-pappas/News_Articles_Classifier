Within each framework, three lots will be awarded, notably building, civil engineering and mechanical/electrical work. The frameworks for operational and minor works projects are expected to be in place by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nGatwick requirements for more complex major works projects, involving contracts potentially greater than £10 million, and for design consultancy services, will be the subject of separate procurement processes, with details to be made available later in 2015.\nInterested firms can find out more about the pre-qualification process and questionnaire in the published OJEU Contract Notice. Additional information will also be made available at a supplier forum which will be held at the Hilton Hotel at Gatwick Airport on 17 September 2015. Companies which meet the above requirements and are interested in completing a questionnaire to register for the supplier forum should follow the instructions within the OJEU notices at the below link:\nLee Hewitt, Capital Procurement at Gatwick Airport said :\n“We intend to appoint a framework of competent, cost effective civil engineering, building and mechanical/electrical contractors, including smaller and local firms, to support Gatwick’s Capital Investment Programme.\n“The major works will help Gatwick to deliver on the next phase of our transformation which has already seen over £1 billion invested since Gatwick entered private ownership in 2009.”\nThe break-up of the BAA monopoly saw Gatwick enter private ownership in 2009 allowing it to compete head-on for the first time with Heathrow, Stansted and other major European airports for airlines and passengers. The next £1 billion investment programme will continue the transformation of Gatwick and will include a completely reconfigured and refurbished North Terminal, ensuring Gatwick has two world-class terminals to offer passengers.\nSource:- Gatwick Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T12:48:23.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
