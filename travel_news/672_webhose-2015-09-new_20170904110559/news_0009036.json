Sweden's latest Icehotel unveiled\nWorried about how these rooms stay up? It's a genuine concern for anyone who's ever experienced the childhood trauma of being buried in sand by siblings.\nThe hotel's basic structure is made of thin walls, covered inside and out with reinforced sand to ensure it doesn't crumble.\nThankfully, the shower, bathroom fittings and deluxe box spring bed are made out of traditional materials. We all know how hard it is to get sand out of towels after a day on the beach.\nFully booked for 2015\nAn overnight stay for two costs $168 a dollar a night, and includes a personal tour of the nearby festival.\nThere are 30 large sand sculptures at each. The Friesland festival alone uses more than 800,000 kilograms of sand.\nLike all sandcastles, sadly, the hotels are only temporary and have already sold out.\nThey'll close once the festivals end (September 28 in Sneek and October 4 in Oss).\nGermany and the UK\nLuckily Zand Hotel plans to reopen both in time for next year's festivals.\nIt's also hoping to create similar hotels in Germany and the UK and has already reserved domain names for www.sandhotel.co.uk and www.sandhotel.de.\nSo there's still time to strike this one off your bucket (and spade) list.\nZand Hotel , Flexaterrein, Opperhuizerweg, Sneek; +31644245949\nZand Hotel , Parkeergarage Bergoss, Oostwal 177, 5341 KM Oss; +31618932544", "external_links": ["http://zandhotel.nl/"], "published": "2015-09-12T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T13:04:21.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
