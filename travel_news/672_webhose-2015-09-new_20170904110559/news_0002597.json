Comment Posted Sep. 23, 2015 at 3:00 PM   23, 2015 at 3:00 PM St. Paul, Minn. Gov. Mark Dayton he's strongly advocating a change in Minnesota's driver's license to make it compliant with federal air travel requirements, even if it means summoning legislators to a special session. Minnesota is among a handful of states that haven't complied with a federal law adopted after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks making driver's licenses more secure through proof of identity. Minnesotans may have to provide a second form of ID for air travel or to get into some federal buildings perhaps as early as next year. The St. Paul Pioneer Press reports Dayton says it makes no sense that Minnesota's driver's licenses do not meet federal requirements for air travel. Minnesota legislators pushed back against the federal Real ID Act in 2010 citing privacy concerns.
