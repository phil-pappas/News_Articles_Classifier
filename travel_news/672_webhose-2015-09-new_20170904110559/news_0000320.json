The pristine beaches, beautiful countryside, authentic Mexican food, fishing villages, friendly locals, whale-watching, wine country, and immaculate riding roads all add up to what could be anyone's idea of paradise. In response to the overwhelming demand for this experience, EagleRider has created several new options for exploring Baja to allow all to enjoy this wonder of the world the way they prefer to and regardless of their schedule or experience.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150930/272246LOGO\nThese new options include everything from 16 day Baja guided tours for those who can't get enough to 4 day tours for those who just want a taste, as well as tours that take the traveler off-roading, tours that feature specific areas like Valle de Guadalupe in the heart of Baja wine country and famous beach town Ensenada , and self-drive tours for those who want to go at their own pace through the countryside.\nVP of Brand Experience Shawn Fechter remarks, \"As EagleRider continues to grow and evolve, we find ourselves past the stage of opening general tours just to make locations available and now at a point where we can give a degree of customization to the traveler never before witnessed in motorcycle tourism.
