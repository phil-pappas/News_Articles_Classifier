A key dispute is Lufthansa’s plan to cut payments for pilots wanting to retire early, a move the union opposes.\nIn a statement released Monday, the union says that an offer it made to Lufthansa that included “vast concessions on a variety of issues” representing savings of over 500 million euros (more than $560 million) had been rejected and that a counter-proposal submitted by the carrier over the weekend to the union was, at first glance, “promising,” but on closer inspection, “insubstantial.”\nOn its website, Lufthansa says it has published a special flight schedule for the strike days, that it “regrets any inconveniences caused” and it will do its best to keep possible disruptions to a minimum. Customers whose flights got cancelled because of the strike are being allowed to rebook or cancel their reservations with no penalties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:15:04.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
