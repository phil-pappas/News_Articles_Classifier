Credit Science Museum, 2013 Drawing visitors into the fascinating world of experimental particle physics, Collider will provide an up-close look at the world's greatest scientific experiment: the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research) in Geneva. Buried deep under the border between Switzerland and France, CERN's Large Hadron Collider is the work of 10,000 men and women from across the globe, united in their quest to uncover the fundamental building blocks of our universe. This immersive exhibition blends theatre, video and sound art with real artefacts from CERN, recreating a visit to the famous particle physics laboratory. Visitors will be transported to the recreated site of the LHC where they can explore the 27-km collider and its cathedral-sized detector caverns. They can virtually meet with scientists and engineers from CERN, snoop around a researcher's workbench, and examine objects up-close. Ultimately, they will discover how studying the subatomic world can point the way to a fuller understanding of our universe. \"ArtScience Museum is thrilled to be hosting the Asian premier of the Collider exhibition. This extraordinary exhibition puts visitors in the heart of an experiment that recreates the conditions that existed just after the Big Bang occurred 13.8 billion years ago. The LHC is designed to answer some of the most fundamental questions we have about the universe. It has already been responsible for the 21st century's most exciting scientific discovery - the Higgs boson, and every week it generates incredible new science, which is shaping the way we understand the world. This deeply immersive exhibition blends theatre, film and science to give visitors a flavour of the life and the community of the LHC. Thus, it is a perfect representation of ArtScience Museum's ongoing efforts to showcase the interrelation of art, science and technology,\" said Ms Honor Harger, Executive Director, ArtScience Museum. \"The LHC is a truly global scientific project, involving scientists and engineers from over a hundred countries. More than 400,000 people visited the Collider exhibition during its European tour and it's fantastic that a new South East Asian audience will get a chance to see the exhibition for the first time at ArtScience Museum,\" Dr Harry Cliff, Fellow of Modern Science, Science Museum. Delving deeper in the LHC, the visitors will follow the journey of particle beams as they are injected into the accelerator chain, ramped up to speed and steered around the 27-kilometre long LHC tunnel. Moving along the tunnel, visitors are then immersed in the highlight of the exhibition - a wrap-around 270-degree projection taking in both extremes of the scale of the LHC: from an enormous experiment cavern, to the very heart of a particle collision where the protons are fired at 99. 1% the speed of light. Through this ground-breaking exhibition, visitors get to witness the beautiful visual representation of a collision, where a shower of new particles is produced and the data is distributed globally to research institutions to decipher the mysteries of the Universe. The Collider exhibition was developed by the Science Museum in London, who commissioned a creative team led by Nissen Richards Studio, including playwright Michael Wynne, video designer Finn Ross and sound designer Carolyn Downing to produce a unique and immersive experience. The tour of the exhibition is made possible by the support of Winton Capital Management. Tickets for the Collider exhibition will be available soon at all Marina Bay Sands box offices and website.
