We’ll most likely appeal [against] the decision as [drivers] use Uber on their own terms, and there really is no typical driver — the key question at issue \n- Uber \nUber said it was “not surprised” by the decision and welcomed the fact he had denied some of the class-action claims. It added: “We’ll most likely appeal [against] the decision as [drivers] use Uber on their own terms, and there is no typical driver — the key question at issue.” \nThe burden will now be on the company to “disprove an employment relationship”, Judge Chen wrote in a 68-page ruling. The most significant issue in determining if workers should be treated as employees concerned whether Uber had the “right to control work details”, he added. \nA number of class-action suits have been brought against tech start-ups that use large groups of contractors, including Lyft, a rival ride-sharing app; Handy, an app for finding cleaners; and Washio, a mobile laundry service. \nThe risk of being found to have misclassified workers as contractors — and of being forced to foot the bill later for the full employment costs — has prompted a number of similar companies to give employee status to some or all of their workers in recent weeks. These include Shyp, a parcel service, and Instacart, a grocery delivery service. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
