This area of the precinct is also home to Sydney’s new ballroom; set to be Australia’s largest, it will seat up to 2,000 guests. \nThe operational preparations of venue manager AEG Ogden are also on track. \nICC Sydney Chief Executive Officer and AEG Ogden Group Convention Centres Director, Geoff Donaghy said the topping out event marked almost 12 months to the testing and commissioning program that will see the entire venue presented and operating at world class standards in time for its opening in December 2016. \n“As the ICC Sydney team continues to build, the operations team is implementing plans to launch world leading technology as well as exceptional culinary and professional business services that will deliver the ultimate in business event experiences,” he said. \nPremier Mike Baird said that the extraordinary progress made at ICC Sydney is evidence of the NSW Government’s commitment to building tomorrow’s Sydney fast and efficiently. \n“This major infrastructure project is moving at a cracking pace and is another example of how the NSW Government is building tomorrow’s Sydney,” Mr Baird said. \n“By the end of next year, we’ll have a state-of-the-art convention centre that truly befits a global city and one that cements Sydney as the number one place to do business.” \nMr Constance said the vibrant waterfront at Darling Harbour will ensure international delegates have an unmatched visitor experience. “This is the biggest and most exciting change to Darling Harbour in 25 years,” Mr Constance said. \n“ICC Sydney will reinstate Sydney as one of the world’s premier business events destinations, boosting the economy by at least $200 million each year.” \nBusiness Events Sydney (BESydney) CEO, Lyn Lewis-Smith said her organisation and ICC Sydney are currently working together to secure events that could deliver around $300 million in direct expenditure to NSW, supporting thousands of jobs. \n\"BESydney has secured more than 20 international events for ICC Sydney, attracting more than 200,000 delegates,” she said. \nICC Sydney is being delivered by the NSW Government in partnership with Darling Harbour Live, comprising Lendlease, Hostplus, Capella Capital, AEG Ogden and Spotless FM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:58:00.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
