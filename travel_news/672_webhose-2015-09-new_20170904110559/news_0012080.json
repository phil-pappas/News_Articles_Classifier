For a complete schedule, see bumbershoot.com/film . Entry to film programs requires a Bumbershoot pass.\nHere are a few highlights: FESTIVAL PREVIEW Bumbershoot: 1 Reel Film Festival Saturday through Monday, Sept. 5-7, SIFF Film Center, Seattle Center. For ticket information or full festival schedule, go to bumbershoot.com/film .\nElle-Máijá Tailfeathers’ “Bihttos,” winner of a SIFF Grand Jury Prize, is a haunting memoir about its narrator’s experience of an idyllic childhood that ends when her father and mother — both activists for indigenous peoples — split up over one parent’s severe depression. (Best of SIFF 1)\n Some short stories you don’t want to end, and that’s the point of Michael Goode’s “The Answers.” A young man finds himself in the afterlife, where all his questions about his truncated existence are answered, including the identity of the great love he let get away. (Best of SIFF 2)\nA woodsman wielding an ax gets a lot of ants in his pants when the residents of a tree fight for their home in the delightful, funny Russian animation “Pik Pik Pik.” (Films4Families)\nMexico’s masked wrestling phenomenon is alive and well in Renton, where the documentary “Luchadora” tells us, in cartoonish visuals, about the lone, local female who has mastered this theatrical sport. (Best of the Northwest 2)\nShirlyn Wong’s “The Mobile Stripper” feels like a blueprint for a successful, future feature about a disabled mall-security cop who befriends a troubled young woman in her kinky-pink truck. (Best of the Northwest 3)\n“Rosa” is a stylish, handsome documentary about Rosa Coj Bocel, a Guatemalan woman who overcame an interrupted education, rape, rejection by her family and a tragic loss to go back to school and become a nurse for her desperate community. (Doc Hour 1)\nThe colorful “American Renaissance” not only manages to capture the otherworldly, slightly spooky flair of a traveling Renaissance circus troupe, it gives us a strong sense of a minisociety playing by its own rules where relationships and family are concerned.
