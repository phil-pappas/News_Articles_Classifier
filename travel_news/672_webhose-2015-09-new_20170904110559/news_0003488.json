If you’re looking for inspiration on how to spend your time off, Dubai is the right place! With brunches, re-openings, cinema and great escapes you are going to have an awesome long weekend! \nKarma Kafe Grand Re-Opening \nKarma Kafe flung open its’ doors last week, following a refurbishment full of Asian teak furniture and plenty of golf leaf. To celebrate, the venue are welcoming DJ Ravin (the man behind the Buddha Bar soundtrack) for a night of electric lounge music. \nWhen: Thursday September 24, from 10pm Where: Souk al Bahar, Downtown Dubai \nLittle Suzie’s Diner Brunch \nAll the American diner favourites are on offer at this brunch, with burgers, fries and plenty of BBQ favourites.

From AED 199 with soft beverages. \nWhen: Every Friday between 12:30pm and 4pm. Where: Pullman Dubai Deira City Centre \nEid with Maz Jobrani \nThe American/Iranian funny man – known primarily for his role on the Axis of Evil comedy circuit – will be performing a one-off stand-up set at the Ritz Carlton this Friday evening, part of Dubai’s official Eid celebrations. When asked his thoughts on Dubai, Jabrani told ShortList: “Dubai’s so obsessed with setting records that I wouldn’t have been surprised if someone told me, ‘This is the roundest building in the world. Yes, a circle is normally 360 degrees but this is 362.’ I swear.” \nWhen: Friday September 25, 5pm Where: The Ritz Carlton \nOktoberfest, McGettigan’s \nThe Irish social institution is getting a Bavarian overhaul this weekend, all in celebration of the lederhosen-slapping good time that is the German Oktoberfest festival. Expect numerous hard-to-pronounce meat dishes and more sauerkraut than you can shake a stick at. \nWhen: Friday September 25 Where: Bonnington Hotel, JLT \nJW Marriott Marquis Sports Brunch \nCricketing superstar and Dubai regular Kevin Pietersen will be hosting a particularly sporty brunch on Saturday, holding a Q&A session with guests, followed by a screening of the evening’s Rugby World Cup matches. \nWhen: Saturday September 26, 3pm to 6pm Where: JW Marriott Marquis \n360-Cinema \nThe cinema screen is shaped like a dome (hence the name Dome Box). The screens are 4K, which is basically HD on steroids, so you will be treated to an incredible picture. Best of all, it’s a “4D” experience… that’s right, not three but FOUR. Expect effects including wind and scent to add an extra dimension to the films. The space is used for educational films and short documentaries. \nWhere: Dome Box is located in Box Park \nEscape Quest \nYou have 60 minutes to escape a locked room called the Explorers' Library armed with nothing but your wits and a couple of partners. Can you get out in time? Available for groups from two to five. \nWhen: Book ahead. Where: Floor 20, HDS Business Centre, Cluster M, JLT, \nCinema: Everest \nThe simply titled Everest tells the true story of two expedition groups and their summit attempts. As the weather takes a turn for the worse and an avalanche strikes, the inexperienced climbers and their guides’ lives hang in the balance. With an all-star cast including Jake Gyllenhaal and Keira Knightly, critics are already touting it as one of 2015's biggest films. Prepare for a harrowing story and incredible cinematic shots. \nPool Day at Jumeirah Zabeel Saray \nJumeirah Zabeel Saray is famous for having one of the better locations on The Palm, set on the end of the western crescent with views of the Marina skyline and out across the Arabian Gulf. The infinity pool is set in the middle of the idyllic tropical resort and well away from the children’s pool for ultimate relaxation. You can either play spot the celebrity or simply lie back and chill, with a butler service ensuring you stay well hydrated throughout the day. \nWhen: Daily Where: The Palm Jumeirah \nOn TV: Foxcatcher \nSteve Carrel transforms himself incredibly to play millionaire John E. du Pont, in the true story of du Pont’s sponsorship of wrestlers as they train for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. Yes, it’s one of those films that is lauded for the performances rather than the story (it often feels slow) but the performances of Mark Ruffalo, Channing Tatum and especially Carrel are brilliant. The fact it’s a true story gives it weight and the slowness of the film actually adds to that creepy feeling that bad things are coming. \nWhen: Saturday 26th, 21:00", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T19:47:47.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
