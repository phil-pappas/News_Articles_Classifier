Selected travel dates apply.\nThe new Manila services will be available for sale next week and Qantas will keep customers updated.\nSchedule*\nFlight Dep Arr Days of week Aircraft QF117 SYD-HKG 1315 1940 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday A330 1340 2005 Tuesday A330 QF118 HKG-SYD 2135 1000+1 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday A330 QF19 SYD-MNL 1725 2230 Sundays A330 QF20 MNL-SYD 2350 1100+1 Sundays A330\nThe fifth weekly Sydney-Manila service (QF19/20) will operate on Sundays from 6 December 2015 and 20 March 2016 inclusive.
