As investigators start to unravel what caused the aircraft to burst into flames on the tarmac, it has emerged that the Federal Aviation Administration issued directives - orders for emergency remedial work - for operators of aircraft using the GE90-85 engine. Although it will take months for a definitive explanation for the fire to emerge, experts have suggested that the blaze on the Boeing 777, which had 172 people on board, was due to what is known as an uncontained engine failure. A British Airways plane catches fire on the runway in Las Vegas This is when a part - such as a turbine blade - is detached and flies out of the engine itself, puncturing a section of the aircraft, such as the fuel tank. “The GE90, including this -85B variant has been subject to various Airworthiness Directives, due to safety concerns about uncontained engine failures – which are a real danger to flight safety,” said James Healy-Pratt, an aviation lawyer and qualified pilot. “It seems that the number one engine, a GE90-85B, suffered an uncontained engine failure, causing high energy debris to puncture the fuel, oil or hydraulic lines.” The first directive issued in February 2011 referred to a crack in a part of the engine which, if not rectified, could lead to an uncontained fire. Then two years later, following reports of three inflight shutdowns, operators were ordered to carry out modifications to the engine’s gearbox. A spokesman for GE said that all directives had been complied with and that the engines had one of the lowest inflight shutdown rates of any large engine flying today. British Airways added: “This incident is being investigated by the NTSB and we therefore cannot speculate as to the causes of what happened.” The rapid evacuation - within 90 seconds - of the aircraft, meant that many passengers were forced to leave their possessions on the aircraft, including wallets, phones and passports. However the National Transportation Safety Board, which will be carrying out the investigation, has allowed BA staff onboard the aircraft to retrieve the luggage and enable passengers to get home.

On August 11 2004 114 passengers and 15 crew were evacuated after encountering problems shortly after take off from George Bush international airport in Houston, Texas. According to an accident report, the crew heard a loud bang and the cabin began filling with smoke. • Why did the Boeing 777 catch fire? Investigators found a blade had pulled away causing the engine to vibrate abnormally, breaking a seal which led to smoke and fumes entering the cockpit and cabin. It eventually emerged that the faulty blade should have been replaced before the flight took off. The problem was put down to the blade being mislabelled and additional checks have since been put in place. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T02:35:30.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
