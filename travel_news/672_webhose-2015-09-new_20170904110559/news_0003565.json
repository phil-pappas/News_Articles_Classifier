The first step in that direction is to overcome the language barrier, says Zhang Haipeng, head of the Association of Chinese Historians. Thirty Years of Chinese History Studies, a book that covers imperial and modern China up to the initial stages of the economic reforms, has now been translated into English. A milestone in Sino-foreign academic communication of historiography It was unveiled by the publisher, China Social Science Press, at last month’s 22nd International Congress of Historical Sciences held in Jinan, the capital of Shandong province. Written by 22 authoritative voices on different periods of Chinese history, the book reflects the achievements of the country and the rapid changes in its societies. The Chinese edition of the book was published in 2008. Zhang, the book’s lead author, considers the English version “a milestone in Sino-foreign academic communication of historiography”. When we held academic meetings, we found overseas scholars knew little about our research In 2005, when the same congress was held in Sydney, scholars from different countries felt it was urgent to have more academic writing on Chinese history in foreign languages to promote conversations between Chinese and overseas academia, Zhang says. “When we held academic meetings in Beijing, we also found overseas scholars knew little about our research methodologies.” Zhang explains the book also extends to some interdisciplinary studies. For instance, it provides an overview of Chinese historical geography, and religious and scientific history. Overseas academia needs to know about the development and creativity of historiography He believes Chinese historians need “to break through the single-line narrative mode, in which history is represented merely as political history and revolutionary history, and greatly expand our research horizon”. Zhao Jianying, who heads China Social Science Press, says: “We’ve tried to translate many overseas historiographical writings into Chinese. These books greatly enrich our own scholars’ research methods. “However, it’s better to go the opposite direction. Nowadays overseas academia needs to know about the development and creativity of Chinese historiography.\" When you talk about a nation’s history, you also have to insert it into a global perspective He says the book represents the highest level of historical studies on the Chinese mainland. French historian Robert Frank, secretary-general of the International Committee of Historical Sciences, strongly recommends the book to Western historians. “When you talk about a nation’s history, you also have to insert it into a global perspective. That means you need to integrate the history of others in such studies,” he said at the seminar in Jinan. What matters more in the study of history is the questions, not the answers As an expert on the Second World War, he is interested in the way the book treats it. He points out that some French historians have been breaking down Eurocentrism in their recent publishing and now consider the Second World War to have started in 1937, when China’s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression (1937-45) broke out, rather than in 1939. Frank also expects Chinese historians to have less Sinocentrism in their studies. He says there will be much-needed debates about the subject, which are needed. “What matters more in the study of history is the questions, not the answers,” he says.
