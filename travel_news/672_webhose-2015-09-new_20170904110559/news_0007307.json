The Hotel is wrapping up preparations for the city’s most exciting culinary festival with Mexican Chefs Héctor Leyva and Esther Sánchez flying in from the beautiful coastal enclave of Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita.\nAs the sun goes down on September 16, 2015, the beat of Mexico heats up the prominent Pool Grill restaurant at Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza with a special menu featuring authentic Mexican gastronomy and creative drinks that will showcase the most authentic Mexican blends till September 26.\nChef Leyva is bringing sizzling Latino flavours to Cairo with a sophisticated menu on offer displaying his unique and contemporary style of Mexican cuisine. Being born in one of the most traditional states in Mexico, Oaxaca, he grew up having a remarkable taste for food and drinks. His passion for cooking and creating sensations led him to live in different cities of Mexico from coast to coast, from Los Cabos to San Miguel de Allende, then Puebla and Queretaro, and finally Puerto Vallarta where Chef Leyva found home at Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita as chef of one of the most significant contemporary Asian food restaurants in Mexico.\nAccompanying Chef Leyva on this ten-day journey to the legendary land of Egypt will be the beautiful Chef Sánchez. Using ingredients at the heart of Mexican street food, her roots lie in her home town of Tepic, where her passion for food developed and led her to be recently promoted as a Junior Sous Chef in Ketsi restaurant.\nMexican Fiesta will feature the most authentic Mexican flavours along with live Latino entertainment, offering Hotel guests a true gastronomic journey and cultural experience from the richest and most famous food regions in Mexico. The a la carte menu at the Pool Grill will feature a variety of original Mexican dishes from guacamole to stuffed ancho chile, ceviche and tortilla soup, as well as spectacular desserts such as tres leches and churros. Alongside the menu, there will be tequila tasting, spotlighting the extensive selection of the country’s agave beverage that will be presented by the Mexican Ambassador to Egypt himself on September 16.\nThose eager to take this exclusive journey will be able to dine each evening at the Pool Grill from 7:00 pm to midnight throughout the ten-day Mexican Fiesta, in addition to a daily special Mexican dish featured at each of the renowned restaurants at Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza.\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:11:12.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
