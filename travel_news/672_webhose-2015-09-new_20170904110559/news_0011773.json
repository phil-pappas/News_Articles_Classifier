Given how important first impressions are, getting greetings right is essential. Take the handshake – in the West it’s considered an indication of sincerity and openness to look at someone directly when shaking their hand, but in some Asian countries this could give the impression that you’re making assumptions about the relationship or being over familiar. Small local nuances can help establish rapport during a greeting. Germans often nod when shaking hands, while in some Muslim countries, men will touch their chest around the heart area after the handshake. Given how subtle some of these differences are around the world, if you’re uncertain about protocol, there’s nothing wrong with letting your host take the lead. In Brazil, people will often stand closer to each other than is the custom in Northern Europe and the US, and even in business situations they might touch each other more frequently during conversations. But if that makes them sound very relaxed it’s worth noting that they frown upon eating with fingers. Even if you’re tucking into a sandwich or a piece of fruit, the use of cutlery is expected. Given how subtle some of these differences are, if you’re uncertain about protocol, there’s nothing wrong with letting your host take the lead And it’s not just food that can catch you out. In Japan it’s considered rude to help yourself to a drink. Instead, wait until one of your colleagues offers to pour one for you. In Egypt, meanwhile, saying no to tea or coffee, even if you don’t intend to drink it, can be frowned upon. Don’t forget to offer and receive business cards with both hands in Japan and China, then study them for a moment and place them on the table in front of you, rather than stuffing them in your wallet (arranging them to match the seating plan is a good tip for remembering names, wherever you are). Chinese businesspeople might tip their head back and close their eyes. It’s not that they’re bored – this posture is often adopted during careful contemplation. In Finland, long periods of silence are common during meetings. But do these cultural differences still matter in our increasingly globalised business world? Yes, especially when they affect interactions within a particular organisation, according to Andrew Kakabadse, emeritus professor of international management development at Cranfield School of Management. “In a really well-led organisation that has a superb people-orientated culture, this will predominate over local cultures,” says Mr Kakabadse. “There are some outstanding examples: companies such as British Airways and British Aerospace have built an effective corporate culture that includes people from many cultures.” Communication breakdowns and local ways of doing things can put paid to years of development, so even if you have been working between cultures for many years, it pays to keep close attention to your company’s “culture” and make sure your communication is always clear. • Find out more about how to receive business travel rewards by visiting British Airways On Business", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T12:41:32.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
