Thirteen people were hospitalised after the blaze. Experts said the pilots handled it “by the book” and dealt with the emergency in exactly the correct manner. They may well have saved lives by doing so. BA B777 blazes in Las Vegas \nFlight BA 2276 was bound for London’s Gatwick Airport and appears to have suffered a catastrophic failure of the port (left-hand) engine just before take-off. \nDramatic photos showed the aircraft billowing smoke. The plane was carrying 159 passengers and 13 crew. \nThe Aviation Herald reported that a fter coming to a stop, the crew radioed “Mayday, Mayday, need fire services”. The control tower replied fire services were already on their way; the crew advised they were evacuating. \nPassengers spoke of panic aboard and of windows melting in the heat, which may have let smoke into the aircraft. \nMcCarran International Airport has four runways; the fire closed one of the four and flight operations continued on the other three. \nThe other plane which caught fire this week was Air India flight AI405, operated with an A320. The fire on that one broke out in mid-air, apparently after the plane suffered a hydraulic problem. \nPassengers reported the left wing was on fire just before landing at Runway 27 at Delhi airport. \nAll 153 people on board including 144 passengers were evacuated safely, with five receiving minor injuries. \nWritten by Peter Needham", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T17:06:16.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
