Jiang Xulian, 39, from China, confessed to stealing the gemstone, worth 10 million baht or about $280,000 after it showed up on an X-ray scan.\nIt is a 6-carat diamond which the Thai authorities took out after a 12 minutes operation. The authorities got to the bottom of the theft by conducting colonoscopy and other medical equivalent of pliers after laxatives failed to get it out.\nJiang Xulian and a Chinese man were arrested at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport on their way out of Thailand on the basis of surveillance video from the fair just outside Bangkok. Earlier that day, the duo was allegedly switched a fake stone for the real one after asking to inspect it. Although the suspects initially denied involvement, the X-ray scans showed a diamond-like object in the woman’s intestine after which she confessed to the theft.\nThe woman agreed to the delicate operation after being told that the gemstone risked injuring her as reported by the chief investigator for the case. The stone was identified by the diamond’s owner after it was removed.\nIf convicted, the two face up to three years in prison.\nHiding gems in the digestive system is a rare but not unknown gambit and has been used commonly by the drug smugglers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:08:22.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
