(AP) â€” Officials in Horry County are drafting an ordinance establishing where helicopter tour companies can operate in the county.\nThe Sun News of Myrtle Beach reports ( http://bit.ly/1h2usWq ) that county leaders hope it will ease the ongoing controversy over the tours. The proposal would prevent the tours from taking off from near residential areas because of the noise the choppers make.\nThree years ago, a helicopter tour opened across from Broadway at the Beach and nearby residents complained. They sued but earlier this year the State Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court that county zoning allowed the operation.\nMore recently, North Myrtle Beach rejected a request by a Florida company to start a helicopter tour in that city. Again, the tour site was near a residential area.\n___\nInformation from: The Sun News , http://www.thesunnews.com/", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1h2usWq", "http://www.thesunnews.com/", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T16:40:21.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
