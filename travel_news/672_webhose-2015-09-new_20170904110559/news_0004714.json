The vast expanse of hills, valleys, and forests stretches from the posh Spa-town Baden Baden to the Swiss border, covering an area of 4,600 square miles. \nWalking, biking or driving â€“ there are many scenic routes that will lead you to tiny villages, sunny Freiburg and its long red sausage , wineries and old-world monasteries. Two of the most recommended tours are the Wine Route and the German Clock Road, which traces the history of the cuckoo clock . For Christmas, visit Gengenbach which becomes the world's largest advent calendar house. \nBut remember: No visit to the Black Forest is complete without a piece of Black Forest Cake, with chocolate, cherries, cream and a good dash of cherry schnapps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T06:04:17.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
