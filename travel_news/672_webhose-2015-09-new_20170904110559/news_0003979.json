MyRoomin sends its in-house travel experts to each hotel to take photos and gather information for travelers who crave a local experience. Rooms for less than $200 and more than $1,000 exist, but most are within the $250-$500 range.\nWhat’s hot: The travel lifestyle breakdown is my favorite part. With a quick glance at each of the nine sections in the “Visiting Paris” tab, you get an idea about what distinguishes it from the rest of Paris: Take your pick from Glamorous, Bohemian, Hip, Artsy, Elegant, Mythical, Historic, Panoramic and Paris Garden. If you need a better idea of where the accommodations are, click on the “All hotel rooms” link on the home page. You will find a map of Paris on your left, with pins to a double column of rooms on your right. Use the heart feature to make your own wish list for a trip. The rooms you see are the rooms you get, based on hotel relationships with MyRoomin.\nWhat’s not: The site enables you to search for a room using 125 criteria, but I had trouble finding this feature while doing my first few searches. (It’ll pop up at the top of the page after clicking on “All hotel rooms.”)\n— Jen Leo, Los Angeles Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T04:21:45.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
