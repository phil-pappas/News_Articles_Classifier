The smallest visible features are 0.5 miles (0.8 kilometers) in size.\nNASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute\nLong considered the farthest planet from the Sun before it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006, Pluto has never before been explored. In July, New Horizons – a nuclear powered spacecraft about the size of a baby grand piano – became the first spaceship to pass by Pluto.\nBy doing so, the unmanned probe has for the first time given scientists the chance to obtain close-up images from the distant and complex dwarf planet. The stunning pictures, displaying chaotically jumbled mountains and other dramatic geographical features, is somewhat reminiscent of the helter-skelter terrain of Jupiter’s icy moon Europa, NASA scientists said.\nNew Horizon began a yearlong download of new images and other data several days ago. The pictures downloaded this past week have more than doubled the amount of Pluto’s surface seen, at resolutions of about 400 meters (440 yards) per pixel.\nNASA said New Horizons will continue to send data back to Earth until late next year. The space agency also said that next week, the probe will beam images of Pluto’s moons Charon, Nix, and Hydra.\nSee also: Flowing nitrogen ice glaciers seen on Pluto", "external_links": ["http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/newhorizons/main/index.html", "http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/soc/Pluto-Encounter/index.php"], "published": "2015-09-13T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T09:14:48.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
