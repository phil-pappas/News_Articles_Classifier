It will become the latest housebuilder to join the blue chip index, following the promotion of peers Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments last year. Gary Hobbs, of Investec Wealth & Investment, said “Berkeley Group has been a huge beneficiary of strong London prices and overseas investors”. With house builders doing so well and Weir Group’s exposure to the slump in commodities, Augustin Eden, of Accendo Markets, said he was not surprised by the changes to the index . Weir Group has been demoted to the FTSE 250, while struggling platinum producer Lonmin, electronics distributor Premier Farnell and Fisher (James) & Son have been given the boot from the mid-cap index making way for four new entrants.

The electronics distributor said in July it was experiencing a slowdown in sales per day in the UK and American markets. Henry Carver, of Peel Hunt, said the relegation to the small cap index would not make any difference to a potential acquirer. The announced changes will be implemented on close of business Friday, September 18, and will take effect from the start of trading on Monday, September 21. Follow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.
