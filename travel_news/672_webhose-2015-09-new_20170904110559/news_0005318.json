It will also enable us to provide more combined trips with the neighboring countries we are already established in.” \n\nEXO Travel currently has offices in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Japan, China and Indonesia. Its Malaysian outpost will serve to manage small-scale operations in Singapore as well. \n\nNicky Henderson has been appointed general manager of EXO Malaysia.
