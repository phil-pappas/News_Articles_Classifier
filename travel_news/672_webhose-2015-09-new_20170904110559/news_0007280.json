San Ignacio de Velasco is currently served by a tiny airport equipped with a dirt airstrip.\nThe new terminal will have a runway 3,000 meters (9,835 ft.) long made of flexible pavement and a 12,600-sq. meter (129,000-sq. foot) platform, according to the state run ABI news agency. It will be designed to be capable of accommodating international flights.\nSan Ignacio de Velasco lies 456 kilometers (283 miles) northeast of Santa Cruz, which boasts Boliviaâ€™s largest international airport, Viru Viru.\nSan Ignacio de Velasco is a popular tourist destination mostly because of its religious and cultural heritage. It is near to the internationally renowned Noel Kempff Mercado nature reserve.\nThe signing in ceremony was attended by Bolivia President Evo Morales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:04:19.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
