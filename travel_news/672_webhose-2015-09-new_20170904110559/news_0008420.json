Sometimes, it’s all too much to bear. I have to step back and take a moment to myself.\nThe constant updates may take a toll on me personally, but so much more devastating is the very real impact the family violence epidemic is having on women and children across Australia every single day.\nThe recent and increased media focus is to be applauded. But the statistics are not new. This crisis is no surprise.\nA lot of people already know my story. Shock was felt throughout Australia.\nPeople asked how it was possible. But the brutal reality is that there are so many more victims that have experienced the same or similar. As a nation we are only just beginning to realise the scale of problem. We are only just now starting to wake up to the sheer enormity of it.\nMy son Luke isn’t the only child to have been killed by a father. I am not the only one to have suffered. Every single day a woman reaches out to me to share their own stories of fear, violence and loss in their homes.\nSo when you read these horrific headlines, don’t just gasp. Please make it your business to speak out and start a difficult conversation about family violence.\nThe day after Luke was murdered I told journalists that family violence can happen to anyone. I told them that it is everyone’s business. And that’s what I’ve been telling every Australian, because we need big changes.\nWe need to empower women, give children a voice and hold perpetrators accountable.\nAs Australian of the Year I have made it my mission to stand with the victims of family violence so that they are supported in the community and have a powerful voice in the corridors of power. Together we need to build a groundswell of support for victims that will make it impossible to hide family violence anymore.\nI cannot bear to read them, but the headlines must not stop until the violence does.
