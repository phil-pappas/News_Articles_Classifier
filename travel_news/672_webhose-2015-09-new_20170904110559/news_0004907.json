See the full list . \nPros of the I amsterdam Card: Great for visitors who plan to visit at least three museums or attractions. For example, admission fees to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum are â‚¬ 10 for each museum. With just one more museum visit, the 24-hour card will have almost paid for itself. The free access to transportation can help visitors avoid the somewhat confusing tram ticket system. The card encourages visitors to see museums in Amsterdam that they may not have considered. Card comes with a full-color guide with map. \nCons of the I amsterdam Card: The card does not grant holders the right to jump lines at participating sights. Could be a waste of money if you don't cram in enough museums in the usage period or take advantage of free transportation. Plan ahead to make sure you make the most of your money. \nWhere to Buy the I amsterdam Card:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T16:05:14.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
