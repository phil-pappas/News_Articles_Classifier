A recent study found that the over 55s spend 40 per cent more on foreign travel than those in the 34-54 group, while a Post Office survey reveals that a quarter of over 55s are seriously considering a so-called \"grey gap year\". \nSome empty nesters set out, iPads in hand, to tick off sights and destinations faithfully on a long-held travel bucket list. Others look for work or voluntary placements overseas; one third of the participants on globalvolunteers.org are now over 55. The baby boomer generation has a love of travel, backed up with money and ambition, and many, like my parents, refuse to take retirement sitting down. \nMy father, Ian, 68, left his role as vicar of a Belfast church five months ago. My mum, Pat, 64, a consultant ophthalmologist at a large teaching hospital, had retired just two months previously. They knew the time had come to retire, but also felt \"energetic and healthy enough to be still able to make some kind of contribution to the world\", as Dad put it. \nA chatty Christmas email from an Australian friend about life post-retirement resulted in an appeal for help with a staff shortage at a theological college in Vanuatu. Dad has a doctorate in theology, and if he could teach the outgoing lecturer's timetable until December, they worked out, it would buy the college valuable time to find a replacement. And so, in June, my parents made the 26-hour journey from Dublin to Brisbane, then caught the weekly 2-hour flight to Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu's largest island, topped off with a one-hour drive down a potholed road through tropical rainforest to the campus. \nFor those still wondering, Vanuatu is a South Pacific nation made up of 80 or so islands that stretch over 800 miles. It was also hit by a devastating cyclone in March this year that killed dozens and damaged 90 per cent of the buildings in the capital, Port Vila. \nObviously I was immensely proud of both parents for being the sort of big-hearted and adventurous people who say yes to a challenge like this. Cyclone Pam had left this impoverished Oceania island state with an even scantier infrastructure than before, and the basic living conditions, physical isolation and poor health care put this seven-month placement firmly in the category of \"not for the faint-hearted\". It certainly made my frequent adventures seem lame by comparison. Ad Feedback \nHowever, as well as feeling in awe of my parents for taking on this new challenge, this was terrible, terrible news for me personally. I'd been spoilt rotten by 34 years of having my parents there, in my childhood home in Belfast, waiting with open arms and a well-stocked fridge for whenever I cared to pop back. \nI never knew how much I valued that safety net of a loving parental nest - should redundancy, a relationship breakdown, illness or some other calamity strike - until it was rolled up and put in storage for seven months. With the Irish Sea separating us, I don't get back to visit my parents as often as I'd like, but I always knew I could be back at the kitchen table within a few hours. Even with a husband and home of my own, I realised, my childhood home is perhaps the one I visit most in my imagination. Now my front door keys had been taken away from me. \nAlong with childish vulnerability came something even more unexpected: quasi-parental terror. I was suddenly petrified about the welfare of my demonstrably competent, worldly-wise parents. Why Vanuatu, I inwardly wailed. What about a nice safe country like Spain? Did they have to go so far? If something bad happens, it will take me 36 hours to get there. What about malaria? And falling coconuts? \nGoogle confirmed my worst suspicions that for acute medical care, the nearest decent hospital was in Brisbane. Never mind Mum's 40 years as a doctor in the NHS and her expertise working in Tanzania, India and Singapore; as their eldest daughter armed with a Macbook, I felt it was my duty to weigh up the risks adequately, and fret accordingly. What if they were robbed? What if someone was threatening them? \nTen years too late, I finally have a taste of what I'd put my parents through when I waved a cheery goodbye and spent the six months after graduation backpacking and motor-biking around south-east Asia. At 24 I had a thirst for adventure and cheap Thai whiskey, and an aversion to internet cafes, only checking in every week or two to pen the loving words of a devoted daughter: \"I'm fine. Bye!\" \nIn senseless anticipation of being \"guilt-tripped\" for staying away so long, I brushed off any sentimentality with a brisk, \"Yeah I miss you too, but there are so many places I just have to see before I head home.\" I rolled my eyes when Mum expressed concern about the condition of Bornean scuba-diving equipment or asked if my travel insurance covered rope-swings in the Laotian rainforest. What I then regarded as \"fussing\" I've come to recognise as love, but I never thought of myself as the love-fussing sort. Until now. Until Vanuatu. \nNow I'm the one forced to listen, laughing hollowly, but inwardly horror-struck at my mum's cheery take on the previous night's midnight drive home from the nearest town along a potholed road in a temperamental truck with no headlights. \"We'd meet and greet other vehicles by shining our mobile phones through the windscreen!\" Mum announces happily, as I bite my fist. \n\"Good for you,\" I manage to force out. \"I'm so pleased you're having a good time.\" And I attempt to console myself the way my mum did when she was the one stuck at home worrying in the rain: with pride. (Familial pride must surely be the go-to consolation of any parent when their child does something that terrifies them.) I also remind myself that travel, adventure and a desire to be of use to other people is in our family DNA. \nBefore I was born, my parents worked in Tanzania and Rwanda and afterwards their work took us to India and then seven years in Singapore. When I set off on the first of many solo jaunts around the world, my mum couldn't blame anyone else for my adventurous streak. \nNow it's my turn to resign myself to the same fact. And I'm relieved that they don't feel held back by their family or friends. I'm glad I'm not their loser daughter whom they don't dare to leave alone for a few months. While they're so far away, having all sorts of adventures and facing new challenges, I want them to be elevated by our support rather than weighed down by our concern. I'm proud to have parents who'll set off on a life-changing adventure in their sixties, but, if I am really honest, I'll be so much more pleased when they come back home. Safely. \n'Perhaps the roles with our children are reversing' \n\"Our generation are unfairly portrayed as money-grabbing, educationally privileged, well-pensioned baby boomers, but most of us are very grateful for the opportunities we had that our parents did not. We were brought up to work hard, to give back to society and to lay a foundation for the generations coming after us. Job security was very precious and few would throw that away to see the world or embark on exciting adventures; that was the stuff of movies, not real life. It's only now, after a lifelong career, that we feel we've earned the right to revisit that fantasy. \nWhen we came to Vanuatu, we were definitely not looking for adventure, but we got it in spades; we were definitely not looking to make more friends (we thought we had trouble enough keeping up with the ones we had) but we have met wonderful people with shared ideals who are indeed now friends. \nAll three children told us they were very proud of us. If we'd known this is what it took we'd have done it ages ago! We were surprised and touched by the concern and interest from our children - for years that was our job! \nI suppose they now see us as vulnerable beings, not just parents, and perhaps the roles are reversing a little. \nIn the meantime, I have promised to try not to fall into any volcanoes. \nThe Daily Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T01:11:33.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
