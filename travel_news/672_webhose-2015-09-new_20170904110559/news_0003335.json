In the meantime, BA's cabin crew was lauded for a brisk but \"orderly\" evacuation that got all of the flight's passengers off the plane via emergency exit chutes in a matter of minutes.\nSmoke spews from British Airways Flight 2276 en route to London's Gatwick Airport at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. Media reports indicate that the Boeing 777's engine caught fire and that all 159 passengers and 13 crew were evacuated with just two minor injuries reported.
