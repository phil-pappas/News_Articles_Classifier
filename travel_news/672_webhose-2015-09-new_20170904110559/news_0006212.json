A later phase would involve building housing, more than 500 units, which would bring the total investment to $500 million.\nTheir first-phase plan for “Bellefield at Historic Hyde Park” calls for developing two hotels, a conference center, a free-standing signature restaurant, a spa and culinary-based retail establishments with 40 residential lofts above the stores.\n“Right now we’re focused on phase one, because that’s what everyone wants and needs today,” said Thomas Mulroy, CEO of the T-Rex company, who spoke with the Poughkeepsie Journal Monday. There is not a similar facility within many miles, but the draw exists, including the CIA, the federal historic sites and Marist College, all nearby, as well as the broader surrounding region, Mulroy said.\nHyde Park Town Supervisor Aileen Rohr said, “We’re eager to move ahead with the actual application to flesh out all the details.” The next step, she said, would be for the developers to present a site plan to the planning board.\n“What exists is a concept plan that dates from that prior project,” she said. “The concept plan remains in place … from that time period. T-Rex is hoping to pick up where that project left off.”\nResidents asked whether the green space on the site would disappear. Barbara Hobens noted that on an old sketch plan, “The buildings are right there along Route 9,” and asked whether they could be set back.\nProject consultant Joseph Gaudio said that in their updated plan, “There’s a 150-foot setback from Route 9,” and that for trees on the site, “We’re trying to preserve the best specimens.” Harvesting of timber from the land has been halted, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:10:56.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
