(NYSE: AN), America's largest automotive retailer, today announced a policy to not sell, lease or wholesale any new or used vehicle that has an open safety recall. This will apply to every one of AutoNation's 293 vehicle franchises across the United States and stands as a confirmation of the company's commitment to delivering a peerless customer experience.\n\"There's no way to expect that customers would or should know of every safety recall on every vehicle they might purchase, so we will ensure that our vehicles have all recalls completed,\" said Mike Jackson , Chairman, CEO and President of AutoNation. \"We make it our responsibility as a retailer to identify those vehicles and remove them from the market until their safety issues have been addressed.\"\nA blanket commitment not to sell vehicles subject to a safety recall is not without cost, as adequate parts are not always immediately available, and AutoNation must hold the vehicles in inventory until they are repaired. The company insists that their customers' protection is worth the investment in the process. They believe that the decision to do so is ultimately the right one, and economic considerations must take a back seat to safety concerns.\nFor this reason, the program addresses AutoNation's entire inventory, going well beyond the vehicles on the sales floor. For example, AutoNation will not wholesale any vehicle that has an open safety recall. The company has taken an explicit position that it will not have any role whatsoever in these vehicles being on the road, and it will not use convenient methods such as wholesaling to rid itself of problematic inventory.\nEven more notable from a customer's point of view is that the company accepts vehicles as trade-ins even if they have open safety recalls – and they value them according to standard guidelines, even with the understanding that there may be additional time and investment in the processing of these vehicles as part of the reconditioning process.\nUnder the policy, all vehicles with open safety recalls are identified, physically pulled from inventory and \"Not For Sale\" hang tags and key tags will be placed on them. There are defined internal procedures for the processing and disposition of these vehicles that each associate will be expected to follow.\nAbout AutoNation, Inc.\nAutoNation is transforming the automotive retail industry through bold leadership. We deliver a peerless automotive retail experience through our customer-focused sales and service processes. Owning and operating 293 new vehicle franchises, which sell 35 new vehicle brands across 15 states, AutoNation is America's largest automotive retailer, with state-of-the-art operations and the ability to leverage economies of scale that benefit the customer. As an indication of our leadership position in our industry, AutoNation is a component of the S&P 500 Index.\nPlease visit investors.autonation.com , www.autonation.com , www.autonationdrive.com , www.twitter.com/autonation , www.twitter.com/CEOMikeJackson , www.facebook.com/autonation , and www.facebook.com/CEOMikeJackson , where AutoNation discloses additional information about the Company, its business, and its results of operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
