Others say it is a stunning art of creation. \nIt is one of the water towers of the Chyulu ecosystem. \nUmani springs owes its existence to rainfall on the northern part of Chyulu Hills where the forest is relatively intact. \nThe fragile ecosystem is a favourite for animal lovers, bird watchers, botanists, entomologists and fun seekers. \nALLURING FOREST CANOPY \nThe underground water is extracted and piped to over 500,000 residents of kibwezi Town, Mtito Andei, Machakos and Chyulu Hills. \nThe springs have created an alluring forest canopy within its ecosystem which has seen the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in conjunction with Kenya Forest Service set up a tourist camp. \nIt attracts domestic and international visitors. Umani is home to elephants, buffaloes, cheetahs, monkeys, crocodiles, pythons, birds and butterflies. The David Sheldrick Eco-lodge overlooks waterholes fed by the springs. \nThe building, with a unique design, comprises three bungalows around a Balinese inspired pavilion-style main building with an outdoor shower and sitting rooms. \nThe lodge has a lovely outdoor dining pergola, a pool, hanging chairs under a fig tree and dining areas. \nThe service is good. “You can carry your food and prepare it or the resident cook can do it for you,” says a tourist in the Globe Traveller Journal. \nThe trust also uses Umani habitat as a centre for rescued baby elephant. \nForest Manager Joseph Mwangi says the Trust has a concession from KFS to protect and preserve this diverse 16,000-acre ground water forest. \nKibwezi Community Forest Association members derive benefits from users’ rights. \nLocals have been employed as scouts, guards and chefs at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust Eco-Lodge and Rescued Elephants Centre. \nBy visiting Kibwezi Forest and enjoying Umani springs, you are supporting the conservation of the unique groundwater ecosystem as well as the animals. advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T07:53:35.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
