More than 100 people have been detained, including local police, gang suspects and Iguala’s mayor.\nGreenpeace protests against the disappearance of 43 students from Ayotzinapa, at La Quebrada in Acapulco, Mexico, on Sept. 6, 2015. Members of the environmental organization called for justice for the 43 missing students while on a visit to Acapulco to promote a campaign to raise awareness about the proper handling of electronic waste.\nPedro Pardo/AFP\nArmy role questioned\nThe report reconstructs a night of terror in Iguala, a city in the southern state of Guerrero known as being part of a drug trafficking route.\nThree students and three bystanders were killed when police shot at several buses.\nIn revelations that raise questions about the actions of other security forces, the report says federal police and the army were monitoring the movements of the students before they even arrived in Iguala.\nFederal police and soldiers were present at different times at two locations where municipal officers detained students, the report says.\nWhile the report does not accuse the federal forces of taking part in the abductions, it says prosecutors should investigate whether they failed in their “obligation to protect citizens.”\nThe attorney general’s office never allowed the commission to interview soldiers.\nProsecutors have suggested that police confronted the students on the orders of Iguala’s then Mayor José Luis Abarca because he believed they would protest a speech by his politically ambitious wife.\nBut the commission said the students arrived in Iguala after the speech and suggested they may have been attacked because they could have taken a bus containing drugs.\nA fifth bus that the students had commandeered was never included in the reports from federal prosecutors, who always spoke of four buses. Authorities did not explain the omission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T19:18:18.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
