And it’s home to some surreal sights. A town where it pays to love colour Source: Just a quiet little piece of street art in Valparasio. Source: \nWith its signature Spanish-inspired architecture, sleek hotels and cafes with coffee waitresses showing off their legs as they serve espressos, Santiago is also a very short distance to snowfields, to horseback rides up the Andes, a buzzy night-life and a heap of vineyards. Colour and cute wall art: in Santiago they are a ‘thing’ Source: \nIt’s well worth scheduling 3-4 days of Santiago sightseeing into your South American bucket list trip and here’s why. \nYou can have a day or two seeing Santiago; take day trip to the historical town of Valparaiso; have a day at a winery then a day to immerse yourself in the Andes — whether you’re on the ski slopes or riding a horse. \nOr you could venture a bit further and trek their UFO trail, or head over to Easter Island. First up: nothing like making friends with the lovely cops in the Plaza de Armas, Santiago Source: Supplied \nYOU MUST SEE: \n• Valparaiso \nThe historic port city of Valparaiso is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and shows what a once exquisite and wealthy merchant town now looks like. \nSure, it’s a little worn around the edges but it is an example of late 19th century architecture with its hills are dotted with thousands of multicoloured houses, homes. And lots of graffiti. ‘Why can’t I paint my house green?’. ‘Sorry, you can't have green because mine is already’ ... Source: \nIn Valparaiso, all of the houses are brightly coloured and one of the rules of the town is that you cannot paint your house the same colour as the one next to you. \nLa Sebastiana, the former home of Chilean Pulitzer Prize winning poet Pablo Neruda is also open to the public and is one of the most popular tourist stops in the town. Much funicular action in Valparaiso: use one at your peril! Source: istock \n• Plaza de Armas \nThis is Santiago’s main hub in the centre of the CBD and perched off the plaza are various historic buildings, including the exquisite Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela (its richness and sumptuousness took my breath away), the main City Hall, a very cool-designed central Post Office and the National History Museum. The Santiago cathedral: every detail is superb and the atmosphere is welcoming as opposed to stitched-up Source: \n• San Cristobal Hill \nThe summit of this hill offers spectacular views of the city, and it can be reached via a funicular railway and up the top is the famous giant statue of the Virgin Mary In fact, it’s the biggest statue of the Virgin Mary in the world. Oh, and Catholicism is the overriding faith of many Chileans. \n• Vineyards \nWe visited the Bodega RE vineyard which is part of the Casablanca Wine Valley (recently named one of the great wine capitals) when we visited we dined at the cellar door, taste-testing some killer wines. Did you know that Chile is the fourth biggest producer of wine? Even beating Australia, which comes in at 5th place? \nThey also do some very interesting ‘mixed’ wine blends like ‘Chardonnoir’, ‘Pinotel’ and ‘Cabergnan’. Umm, I’ll have the 4th glass from the right please ... Source: At the Bodega RE vineyard, the whole place had a serious rustic charm Source: Casablanca: There are certainly some vines there in those grounds ... Source: istock \n• Graffiti \nIt’s hard not to see it, because it is, literally everywhere. Some of it is pure street art others bits are, well, just tedious tags that don’t contribute much to the look of the city at all. Some of the best, though, can be found in the bohemian neighbourhood of Barrio Bellavista which is also the coolest place for funky eateries and a buzzy night life. \n• Valle Nevado ski resort \nThe ultra popular ski and snowboarding resort is literally a one-hour drive out of the city of Santiago. It is in the El Plomo foothills in the Andes Mountains and the best time of year to be there is about the same time as an Australian winter. It has also just received its first ski resort gondola and had an easy 30cm of snow last week.

I wish there was a word that wasn’t as sterile as ‘museum’ as it doesn’t do justice to this architecturally exquisite space that traces the rise, brutality and the ultimate fall of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship from 1973-1990. The Museo de la Memoria los derechos Humanos uses audio, visuals and in a spectacular and extraordinary way to retell history. A REAL must-see. \n• Horseriding on the Andes \nSeriously, this was the best fun ever, A troupe of us were given a horse each (mine was a slow little chomper named Pistachio) and we slowly made our way up the Andes Hills. A company called Andes Riders had organised a brilliant BBQ and a glass of Chilean red that awaited us once we arrive up top. \nThe vista was spectacular with the snow-capped Andes never far from our eyesite as our horses led a well-trodden path up the mountain. Total heaven and made even more fun by the trip back DOWN the hill ... Pistachio and me: thanks for the fun ride Christian from Andes Riders Source: Andes Riders: loving their clomp-clomp up the hill ... Source: Supplied \n• Coffee With Legs \nYup this had to be done. One of the most funs ways to have a coffee. Served by gorgeous girls showing off their legs while serving you a macchiato? I mean, coffee with sex appeal, why not! South Americans aren’t shy!

Look at the snow-capped Andes! My first peak at Chile as our Qantas flight started its descent into Santiago Source: \nBeing the only airline that flies a non-stop service from Sydney to Santiago Qantas also uses codeshare services operated by LAN from Santiago to six destinations across South America, including Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Lima. \nThe QF Business Cabin to Santiago featured Skybed sleeper seats, a self-service refreshment bar and mood lighting with additional ground services including dedicated check-in counters in all ports, priority baggage with additional allowances, priority boarding and disembarkation and express customs and immigration in selected ports. \nThe restaurant-style menus were ‘designed’ by Australian chef and restaurateur Neil Perry and business customers could choose from a range of menu options and refreshments throughout the flight. \nWHERE TO STAY: \nWe were invited to test run the Novotel Santiago and it was worth every minute, and best of all, the tariffs are seriously affordable. The Novotel is in a ‘nice’ end of town, in Vitacura, and is just a street away from the smarty pants ‘designer’ fashion strip of Santiago. \nThe hotel, which is part of the Accor Hotels group has a slight business feel to it, but that said, it is immaculate, has a killer breakfast buffet and the sunset (below) would greet me each night on my stay. Bliss ... Sweet treat to greet guests at the hotel. The red went down very well, btw ... Source: \nThere is a ‘Stay and Chile’ at Novotel Santiago with three nights from $640 (plus VAT 19 per cent) (two people twin share) while six nights start from $1300 (+VAT) (two people twin share) \nThese packages include buffet breakfast, free internet, UG parking, heated pool, jacuzzi, and late check out of 4.30pm. \nFull board packages are also available including breakfast lunch and three course dinner plus a glass of wine or soft drink, at Restaurant 365 at Novotel, from $850 for two people (twin share) for three nights, or from $1,700 for 6 nights. Valid for bookings and travel from now until to December 31, 2016. \nTo book — Email: h5233-re@accor.com specifying the package type required. A Santiago sunset, each night from my Novotel room.
