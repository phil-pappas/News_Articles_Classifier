(Screengrab from ICT’s spot) \nThe singing sloths and sea turtles from the Costa Rican Tourism Board ( ICT )’s TV spot are attracting not only tourists but also international recognition. The ad is a finalist in a first-ever international competition held by the World Tourism Organization ( UNWTO ). \nThe “Save the Americans”/“Save the Canadians” spot is part of ICT’s ad campaign aimed at promoting Costa Rica as a holiday oasis and the ideal place to take a break from daily stress in these countries. Canada and the U.S. are two of the main sources of tourists to Costa Rica. \nThe spot was produced in Costa Rica and includes the participation of Tico vocal group Master Key , which performed the voices of a singing sloth, a bird, turtles, scarlet macaws and a howler monkey who invite overworked Americans and Canadians to come to Costa Rica. \nVideos were submitted from 51 countries and the winner will be chosen by popular vote. The winner will be announced during the 21st General Assembly of the UNWTO to be held in Medellín, Colombia, Sept. 12-17. \nThe video already won a “ Webby ” for Best Online Film & Video in the “Travel & Adventure” category. \nDestination Marketing Association International also chose the campaign as a success case in promoting a destination, during its international forum last July. \nICT Promotions Director Ireth Rodriguez said the promotional spot is an invitation for those who have not visited the country to consider Costa Rica as their next vacation destination. \nThe $3.3 million campaign began in December 2014 and will continue through January 2016. The singing animals spot is being shown on TV, in movie theaters. In the coming days, it will also be projected on buildings in the U.S. and Canada. \nYou can vote for Costa Rica’s spot here .
