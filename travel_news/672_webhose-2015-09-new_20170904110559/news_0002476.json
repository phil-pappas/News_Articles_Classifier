(Photo: Flagler College)\n1092 CONNECT 133 TWEET 24 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. — It’s a bluebird summer day as I spot the Castillo de San Marcos in the distance. Made of crushed coquina shells and rows of cannons, it stands firm on the edge of the Matanzas Bay, a relic of the 17th century.\nBut instead of mingling with the masses, I’m cozy aboard a 27-foot Stiletto catamaran with some newfound friends: a family visiting from Tennessee, a local couple kicking off a birthday celebration and a captain who is equal parts entertaining and genius.\nAs we approach Vilano Beach, the skim boarders zipping across the water capture our attention first. Seconds later, an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin breaks the surface, and our chatter turns to oohs and aahs. Better yet, Captain Zach McKenna, interpretive naturalist and owner of St. Augustine Eco Tours , recognizes the individual.\nA dolphin’s dorsal fin is like a human fingerprint with different identifying notches, he explains. This happens to be a dolphin that he sees on a regular basis.\n“That’s a tail dive,” he says, as the graceful creature disappears. “It indicates the dolphin is going a bit deeper.”\nMcKenna knows his stuff. After spending more than two decades exploring the Florida coast, he has amassed an arsenal of experience and information.\nBeverly Sanford, who has been on 20 excursions with McKenna’s company, can attest to that.\n“My husband refers to him as a ‘scholar’ of the water,” she says. In turn, the exploratory trips over the past nine years have given her family a deep appreciation for marine life.\n“We keep coming back for rest, family time, inspiration and solitude,” she says.\nMcKenna enjoys showing people the less explored areas of St. Augustine. And there are plenty. Overall, there’s an impressive 73,000 acres of protected ocean, beaches, coastal scrub, salt marsh, mangrove estuary, freshwater marsh, maritime hammock and pine flatwoods to peruse.\nSure, St. Augustine doesn’t get the attention that its neighbor Orlando does. And that’s exactly its appeal. It’s unassuming and authentic, and it's celebrating a big birthday , turning 450 on Sept. 8.\nUSA TODAY\nAww! Rare manatee twins born in Florida waters\nStep back in time\nFor a peek at the Ancient City’s history, I stop by Flagler College , built as a hotel by self-made millionaire Henry Flagler in 1888. In its heyday, it was an exclusive resort where five former U.S. presidents stayed. In fact, it had electricity three years before the White House did. With stunning Spanish Renaissance architecture and original artwork, it’s no surprise that it’s a National Historic Landmark.\nMy group gathers outside in the courtyard, staring at the words etched in Latin at the entrance.\n“Doesn’t it say something like no tortillas and more eggs please?” asks the lady next to me.\n“Actually, it’s something along those lines,” says the tour guide. “Henry Flagler had a sense of humor.”\nWith a collective chuckle, we enter the building. The wonder continues. In the grand lobby we are wowed by the 68-foot domed ceiling supported by eight female figures serving as columns. Next, we waltz into the Hogwarts-style dining room. Hand-painted murals hang on the walls. Sunlight pours in from 79 Tiffany stained-glass windows. Here, it’s easy to envision a certain bespectacled boy wizard chatting up Hermione or receiving an owl post.\nThe tour ends in the Flagler Room. Ceilings are painted Tiffany blue, and the hand-crafted chandeliers date back more than 125 years.\nContinue to wander along the medley of narrow streets in St. Augustine, and you’ll run into pieces of the past around every corner: the Cathedral Basilica, home to the first Catholic parish in North America; Aviles Street, the oldest street in the USA; and the Lightner Museum, which boasts artifacts like a fossilized dinosaur egg and a stuffed lion that belonged to Winston Churchill.\nUSA TODAY\nHidden Florida: Amazing wildlife beyond the tourist attractions\nThe view from above\nAsk a handful of people for their thoughts on St. Augustine, and you’ll get a mishmash of answers. For some, it’s a place of Old World allure that embraces just the right amount of yesteryear and modernity. For others, the focus is squarely set on the charming beach culture full of surfers, hole-in-the-wall eateries and geographic superlatives.\n“St. Augustine has a wonderful energy,” says Lorelie Johnson, an Orlando resident who has visited the city twice a year since 1998. “You feel welcome when you arrive, and there’s enough to stop and enjoy, but not too much to feel overwhelmed and stressed.”\nTo get a big-picture view of the city, I choose to hop into a 1935 model WACO biplane around sunset. Dave Genet, owner of St. Augustine Biplane Rides , greets me with a grin. Within minutes, we strap on old-school pilot caps and taxi down the runway to relive the Golden Age of flying, open cockpit and all. We pass by the lighthouse, the Castillo and Flagler College.\nWhen we drop to about 500 feet, I’m on the lookout for manatees, rays and sharks. Ever vigilant, I pat myself on the back for spotting a shark and teeming schools of baitfish.\nAs we swoop down even lower, the piece-de-resistance appears: the salt marshes, where water snakes through the neon-green grass for miles. I imagine the creatures I’d meet if I were a spoonbill gliding inches above it. Fiddler crabs, marine worms and jellyfish galore.\nI thought I had a good handle on the splendor of this area, but I was wrong. It’s even more gorgeous from 1,000 feet in the air. I can’t wipe the silly grin off of my face. The puffy clouds above. The greenery below. It’s like falling into a good dream.\nIF YOU GO\nWhere to eat\nThe Beachcomber: Sit outside under the large umbrellas and chow down on oversized pancakes with all the right toppings.
