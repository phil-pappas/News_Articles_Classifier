Additionally, the partnership is creating added benefits for Hilton HHonors members. Through the HHonors app, HHonors members can already book a stay, check-in, select their room, pre-order amenities and use their smartphone to enter their hotel room door with Digital Key. Later this month, HHonors members will also be able to explore the ‘Local Scene’ in select U.S. cities through a digital guide of the top trending restaurants and nightlife spots selected for being the most frequented destinations with Uber riders. \n“By partnering with Uber, a leading innovator, we’re helping travelers explore destinations like they’re locals,” said Rich DiStefano, senior director of Mobile Products at Hilton Worldwide. “This is the first time any company has leveraged Uber riders’ most frequented destinations to provide local recommendations. We’re excited to offer these unique benefits for our loyal guests.” \nThe Hilton and Uber partnership is rooted in novel mobile advancements that enhance the travel experience from the start of the journey to departure. These advancements will give Hilton guests the ability to: \n• Simplify their stay with the Uber ‘Ride Reminder’: A first for the travel industry, the ‘Ride Reminder’ allows Hilton guests around the globe to set an Uber Ride Reminder with a single tap. Say goodbye to long taxi lines – when it's time to head to the hotel, the ‘Ride Reminder’ will send a push notification or text, and the hotel’s address is automatically set in the Uber app, so guests can simply be on their way. Additionally, all Hilton guests who sign up for Uber will receive $20 off their first ride. \n• Discover the most popular restaurants and nightlife spots with ‘Local Scene’: Later this month in 20 major U.S. cities, Hilton and Uber will launch a feature within the Hilton HHonors mobile app that provides members with a list detailing the ‘Local Scene’, top venues most frequented by Uber riders in each city. With these guides, HHonors members will be able to use the app to gain exclusive insights from other Uber riders on where to go or what to explore in the city they’re visiting. \n“Hilton is a leader in digital innovation and has a unique mobile-first approach that makes them a natural partner for Uber,” said Jonathan DiOrio, head of Travel Partnerships at Uber. “We are always looking for new ways to make the Uber experience even better for our millions of riders worldwide and are excited to offer these new features for the first time exclusively to Hilton guests and HHonors members.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:58:00.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
