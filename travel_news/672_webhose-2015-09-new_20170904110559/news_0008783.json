(AP) -- Grand Canyon National Park officials say several areas below the North Rim will be temporarily without drinking water while workers repair a pipeline break that occurred over the weekend. The break occurred north of Phantom Ranch in an area known as the Box and means no drinking water is available along the North Kaibab Trail at Cottonwood Campground and Manzanita Rest Area. According to park officials, all trails remain open and drinking water is available at least for now at Phantom Ranch in the bottom of the canyon. However, park officials say hikers must be prepared to carry or treat all drinking water. The park says crews should finish repairing the pipeline sometime this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T01:45:26.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
