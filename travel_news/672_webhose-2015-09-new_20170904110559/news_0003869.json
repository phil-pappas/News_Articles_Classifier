These destinations are inexpensive for the Chinese.” \n\nHe added: “Sri Lanka, India and Nepal have also risen in popularity among smaller groups (of eight to 10 people) without a tour leader. Such groups comprise friends and family members who are keen on exploring different cultures together.” \n\nAlso observing a pick up in Chinese demand for Sri Lanka is Romeo Luo, FIT specialist with Spring Airlines Chongqing business office & Chongqing International Travel Service. \n\n“The demand is up especially from honeymooners who are drawn to beach resorts (which Sri Lanka has aplenty),” Luo said. \n\nTravel trade from South-east Asia also revealed that Chinese demand is holding strong. \n\nRonald Poe, managing director of Yangon-based Asia Global Travels & Tour, said the Chinese are drawn to Myanmar as it is a “newly opened destination”. \n\nHui Seila, deputy director of marketing & promotion department, Ministry of Tourism of Cambodia, told the TTG Asia e-Daily that “Chinese arrivals to Cambodia are still strong due to the close proximity (of the countries).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:33:38.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
