They won Best Front Garden and Grand Champion in the Chronicle Garden Competition. \nToowoomba Carnival of Flowers is famous for the colourful public floral displays.

Owner Ben, in his 90s, still works in the garden every day. \nBen and Mavis Mundey collected every rock in their garden, breaking them into pieces they could fit in their Holden. It took 131 trips. \nGordon and Maria Reynolds used to run a native plant nursery and had a two acre garden before downsizing to 990m² in Toowoomba’s suburbs, but this garden is still full of Aussie natives to attract the birds they love. They also want gardeners to see you don’t sacrifice colour and flowers if you plant Aussie natives – grevilleas bloom for them almost year round. Maria says the more you prune them, the more flowers you get. \nAllan and Mary Kenna took top honours in the Heritage Bank Cottage Garden category with their backyard where brick-paved paths ramble through interplanted veges, herbs and perennial flowers. \nTiny solar speakers are dotted among the crops at the Pure Land Learning College vege garden. They emit chants which, our guide told us, ensure the crops grow well and keep the worms happy! The veges grown are used to feed staff and students at this Buddhist school. \nA highlight of the Toowoomba Carnival of Flowers if the opening parade - this year a crowd of more than 100,000 gathered to watch. 1 of 10 « Previous « Previous Next » Next » \nToowoomba's Carnival of Flowers is the longest running floral event in Australia, held over ten days every September and now in its 66th year.
