Pontis' presentation, \"Changing the Consumer Experience, One Minute at a Time,\" will be held on Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015 , from 11-11:50 a.m. ( Watch the overview video .)\n\"Consumers are demanding a more efficient, transparent, and engaging car-buying experience,\" said Pontis. \"Yet, many automobile retailers are operating with the same sales and F&I process they followed decades ago. Others are looking to the 'one-hour car deal' to speed consumers' time in hopes of improving the experience. In doing either, dealers are missing the point of retailing and could also be missing out on opportunities to present their products and services. What really matters in the car-buying experience is delivering engaged, rewarding time to consumers. That can help trump speed, build loyalty, and improve profitability for dealers, too.\"\nDuring his presentation, Pontis will help dealers learn how to:\nIdentify and eliminate sources of wasted time during the sales process. Recognize the way customers perceive how that time is spent in the dealership can be more important than the amount of time actually spent there. Deliver the engaging, transparent buying experience that consumers now expect.

He also discussed strategies dealers can use to improve that experience: reducing wait times when practical and making the time more informative, engaging, and productive where possible.
