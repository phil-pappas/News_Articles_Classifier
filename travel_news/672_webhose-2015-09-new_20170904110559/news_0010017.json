The Golden Lamb Buttery in Connecticut’s “quiet corner” still asks gentlemen to wear a jacket and tie and ladies to go a little glam.\nDinner here is a multifaceted affair. It begins around 7 p.m. with an introduction to a server in a plaid pinafore who will be your personal guide for the evening and ends pretty much whenever you decide to head back to your car beneath a crisp, dark, starry sky. In the intervening hours, you’ll sip cocktails on the deck of an historic barn overlooking a picture-postcard panorama of fields and glassy pond, complete with frolicking animals; take a hayride around part of the thousand-acre farm, singing along with a guitarist; enjoy a leisurely, gourmet farm-to-table dinner; and probably meet owner Katie Bogert, whose grandparents launched this culinary experience 52 years ago.\nContinue reading below\nIn 1963 Henry Robert “Bob” Booth and his wife, Virginia, known as “Jimmie,” began offering a simple lunch, using the bounty of their Hillandale Farm, to customers who came to Brooklyn to buy custom suits at their woolen mill and shop, Hillandale Handweavers. As demand for custom clothing waned, interest in culinary excellence, particularly farm-to-table experiences, grew, and in 1973 the Booths began offering dinner. Bob was the host and Jimmie the chef, and the energetic couple filled these roles well into their eighties. Jimmie Booth died in 2011 and Bob in 2012.\nBogert began checking coats at the Golden Lamb when she was 13. She worked through high school as a dishwasher and during college graduated to waitressing. She earned a degree in business administration from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and took over from her grandparents eight years ago.\nShe has made precious few changes to their time-tested formula. “One big change,” she says with a laugh, “is that we now accept credit cards.” She has also expanded the restaurant’s wedding and event business.\nAnd the dress code?\n“Bob wore a jacket and tie just about every day of his life,” Bogert recalls. “They wanted an elegant restaurant – even though we’re in a barn. . . . I’ve thought about changing that, but it is nice that everyone is dressed nicely.”\nJimmie Booth named the restaurant. The story goes that she was struck one evening by the sun’s rays glinting off a lamb in the field, turning its fleece golden. As a textile buyer for Lord & Taylor, she often traveled to Ireland, where a “buttery” is a sandwich shop, and she adopted the word for her small lunch operation on the farm.\nEllen Albanese for The Boston Globe\nThe restaurant is housed in a barn situated among low stone walls on a thousand-acre farm.\nMy husband and I arrived at the Golden Lamb on a warm June evening and were immediately introduced to Robin, who would not let us far from her sight for the rest of our visit. As we followed her through the cavernous red barn to the deck, we passed all manner of memorabilia from the farm, the Booths, and the restaurant — decoys, birdhouses, primitive furniture, farm implements, framed newspaper clippings, family photographs, blown-up copies of checks signed by famous people (including Roger Clemens). Near the far end, bathed in the light from the sun coming through the wide barn doors, Frank Racette played a piano.\nWe settled at a table on the deck with our drinks and gazed over amazingly manicured fields, broken by white post-and-rail fences and seeming miles of low stone wall. Late sunlight on the still pond illuminated perfect reflections of the trees along the far shore. The effect was mesmerizing.\nRobin interrupted our reverie to let us know a hay wagon ride was about to depart. Did we want to take it? Or would we prefer to wait for another? We waited.\nA little while later (10 minutes? An hour?) we clambered aboard the wood-sided wagon and took a seat on a blanket-covered hay bale for a short whirl around a very small part of the farm. Susan Lamb played her guitar and sang, and those who chose sang along. Midway through the ride, a golf cart came flying across the pasture (at least to those of us traveling at tractor speed, the golf cart seemed to be flying). It pulled up to the wagon, and Bogert herself stood up and delivered a cucumber-spiked gin and tonic to one of our wagon-mates.\nEventually we made our way to dinner in the Farm Room, one of four dining rooms. A peek inside the kitchen was shocking; at 12 feet by 21 feet with its white enameled stoves, white cupboards and drawers, it looked like an ordinary farm kitchen, not a place capable of turning out multicourse gourmet meals for up to 86 people a night.\nThe Farm Room was rustic and cozy, with knotty pine paneling, Oriental rugs over wide floorboards, antique glass bottles on the window sills, even a deer head mounted on one wall. Other dining rooms include the Hunt Room, the Studio, and the Loft. The primo table in the Loft is a cozy setting for two called the Bird’s Nest, which is often booked up to three months in advance, Bogert said.\nLamb stops by each table to drop off a song list from which guests can make a selection for a serenade. Running the gamut from Irving Berlin to Boz Scaggs, it read like a boomers’ top 40, with every song ever sung at a 1970s wedding – including ours.\nA lifelong Connecticut resident, Michael Hellyar of East Haven was visiting the Golden Lamb for the first time, with his wife, Maryellen. “It’s different from any dining experience I’ve ever had,” he said. “It’s more like going to someone’s house — someone with a nice, big estate.”\nTo say we ate well would be an understatement. The prix fixe menu includes several choices in each category, beginning with hot and cold soups, such as shrimp bisque and chilled pear pineapple; moving on to roast duckling and Chateaubriand, among other entrees; and finishing with an assortment of homemade desserts, such as limoncello mascarpone cake and coconut cream pie. The sides were a surprise – dish after dish of fresh vegetables such as Swiss chard, chilled peas with mint, mushrooms and garlic, and orange-glazed carrots.\nDinner is over when you say it’s over. There’s one seating a night, and servers encourage guests to stay as long as they like. As my husband and I returned to our car well fed and relaxed, I found myself thinking, “You know, he looks pretty good in a jacket and tie.”\nTHE GOLDEN LAMB BUTTERY , 499 Wolf Den Road, Brooklyn, Conn., 860-774-4423, www.thegoldenlamb.com .\nEllen Albanese can be reached at ellen.albanese@gmail.com", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Ffor-farm-feast-wear-your-finest%2FYFtUOXRlarAND8npeqIKmL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=For", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Ffor-farm-feast-wear-your-finest%2FYFtUOXRlarAND8npeqIKmL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&media=//c.o0bg.com/rw/Boston/2011-2020/2015/08/21/BostonGlobe.com/Travel/Images/GoldenLambKatieBogertinStudiocreditGoldenLambA.jpg&description=Golden", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=For", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Ffor-farm-feast-wear-your-finest%2FYFtUOXRlarAND8npeqIKmL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tFor", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Flifestyle%2Ftravel%2F2015%2F09%2F05%2Ffor-farm-feast-wear-your-finest%2FYFtUOXRlarAND8npeqIKmL%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=For"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T23:33:41.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
