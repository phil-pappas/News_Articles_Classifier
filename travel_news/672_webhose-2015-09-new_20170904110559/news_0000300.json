And it really builds bonds. What can be better than working out with friends who also happen to be your colleagues?\" But the company does more than just create a working environment that facilitates exercise. There are some serious practical considerations that make it cheaper – and easier – to become involved in physical activity. \"We’re part of the Cycle to Work scheme which allows everyone a tax-free bicycle on which to travel to work,\" says Howden. An hour away from your desk to work out does the world of good And like many of the companies that topped the board at Britain's Healthiest Company, they also have a free on-site gym and showers at head office – and perhaps unsurprisingly, a generous clothing allowance for sportswear. But they have taken things further, as Howden explains. \"We also have a laundry room so that people can wash their sweaty kit,\" she says. \"It makes it really easy for everyone to participate in sports before, during or after the working day and so helps our staff maintain active lifestyles.\" While not all companies have the space for gyms and laundries, Howden believes that sometimes just a simple shift in attitude that can make a really significant difference to improving staff involvement in physical activity. \"If another company was looking to get more staff active, I think the one thing that could really help is supporting the idea that an hour away from your daily tasks to work out will do you the world of good is key,\" she says. \"Actively encouraging the time for a break and not frowning upon it is something that everyone in the business does naturally.\" Visit telegraph.co.uk/britainshealthiestcompany to find out how winners have benefited from the 2015 Britain's Healthiest Company awards, or sign up to the 2016 awards here »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:59:05.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
