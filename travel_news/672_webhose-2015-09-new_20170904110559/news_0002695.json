Comment Posted Sep. 28, 2015 at 9:10 AM By John Hacker Posted Sep. 28, 2015 at 9:10 AM With visitors from Germany, Britain, the Czech Republic and California, Tuesday was not really an unusual day at the Boots Court on historic Route 66 in Carthage. About a dozen Czech citizens stopped at the historic motel while riding the route on Harley Davidson motorcycles, and they were pausing at anything interesting on Route 66. “We stop everywhere where we find it interesting,” said Lukas Noga, from Prague in the Czech Republic. “We appreciate the original stuff that was on the road and the Boots Motel is definitely recommended as one of the stops we have to do.” Among the visitors checking out on Tuesday were Martin Rosenthal, from near Dusseldorf in Germany, who stayed last night in Room 6, the room that legendary actor Clark Gable stayed in when he passed through Carthage in the 1950s. Rosenthal said he was traveling from Chicago to LA on the Route and had dreams about Gable and Marilyn Monroe during his night in Carthage. Also checking out was a couple from Britain. Steve Betts and Laura Whitaker, from Barnsley, near Manchester in England, said they were on a “reverse honeymoon.” “We're riding Route 66 from Chicago to the Santa Monica Pier and we're going to get married on the Pier,” Betts said. “We're on our honeymoon first, then we'll end it with our wedding in California,” added Whitaker. “It's a honeymoon in reverse.” It's a typical day in the life of Debbie Dee, who manages the Boots for owners and sisters Debye Harvey and Pricilla Bledsaw. It's also a typical day for Shawn Kerkhoff, who was also traveling the Route from California. Kerkhoff works at 66 To Cali, a store at the Santa Monica Pier in Los Angeles, the west end of Route 66. “We get about 75 pr 80 percent of our business from foreign travel,” Kerkhoff said. “Number one is Australians, then it's the Brits, the Germans, French, Norwegians, Czech Republic, Brazilians, Japanese, Chinese, all over. There's a world wide fascination with Route 66 that Americans themselves don't appreciate to the same degree.” Kerkhoff may work on the route, but for the next few days, he's a tourist, traveling the route both ways in an RV with his mother. He said it's places like the Boots Court and the Route 66 Drive-In Theater in Carthage that make Route 66 the international tourist draw it is. “These places are special because they're authentic,” Kerkhoff said. “I stayed here in 2013 during the festival you guys had in Joplin and Carthage and it was great. The rooms are authentic and built to the era. That part of Route 66 is what makes it real and makes it special. It's what the people who come to our business want to experience, so we promote that. They can stay at the chains anywhere but we want them to stay at places like The Boots, eat at the independent restaurants. To me, that's America, it's nostalgia, it's everything that's best about America.” Page 2 of 2 - Noga said Route 66 is big in Europe. “It's pretty big for motorcyclists generally because the name of the road is associated with the Mother Road,” Noga said. “It's a dream of a lot of people, especially cruiser bikers, to go at least once in a lifetime and do it. The best thing we love about it is actually the people, very friendly and very generous. The old-world atmosphere is just amazing.” By John Hacker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:36:46.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
