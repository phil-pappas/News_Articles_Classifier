Playful, friendly but never flirty, she emphasises each word with a pink ostrich feather in her hand.\nShe introduces herself and then poses twice for each picture. First full frontal, hand on hip, head tilted, no smile. Then a 180-degree turn, looking over her shoulder defiantly into the camera. In her underwear, she strides across Times Square painted as an American flag as if it were her living room.\n“Here I am: topless in the heart of my city! It’s a very freeing feeling”, she explains with a laugh.\nOver the summer, body-painted topless performers – referred to by mass media as “desnudas” – have polarized New York City and turned Times Square into an unlikely battlefield for gender equality.\nAll at once, Saira is reclaiming her own body and her city. Not long ago, the mecca of American tourism was populated by sex workers, transvestites, drug addicts and petty criminals, rather than middle-class tourists. To Saira, her performance is a tongue-in-cheek reminder of darker days.\nPerhaps no one is less thrilled about it than Mayor Bill de Blasio , who has embarked on a crusade against the “proliferation of topless individuals and costumed characters who too often harass people and expose families to inappropriate acts”.\nSaira, one of his several targets, is petite, though the wedge sandals and feather headdress may mislead at first. Across her chest are painted the words I <3 NY, which she really does – after all, she says, in which other city in the world could her African American and Pakistani parents have met?\n“This is literally how I dress at home and now I can do that here in public and celebrate with people,” she says.\nA 29-year-old media graduate of Hunter College, she started a year ago after seeing an online ad. While public nudity may have inevitable feminist undertones, the politics weren’t always as pronounced. But following the media storm which followed the group this past month, Saira now sees her job as an act of rebellion.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Saira in Times Square. Photograph: Caterina Clerici\nAn older passerby, Lydia Mejia, confronts her. “Why are you degrading yourself like that?” she asks aggressively. “What do you gain from it?”\nNow retired, Lydia used to clean offices and apartments in the area. It used to be nicer, she says; but now it’s full of ladies looking for “easy money”.\n“It’s disgusting,” she adds. “I don’t think women should express themselves like that. Lord gave us a body and we should respect that. You don’t have to do that to be free.”\nSince the controversy started, Saira’s three-member team has been working every day. Out of principle, they won’t be intimidated by the NYPD, who keep an eye on them from a distance while directing confused foreigners towards the subway.\n“From the day I started I knew it was gonna become a movement,” she says. “This is something that should be talked about. It doesn’t mean you have to like it. It’s fine you don’t! But talk about it. Think about why you don’t like it, think about where you’re coming from.”\n‘Women’s bodies don’t belong to themselves’ This summer, hundreds of New Yorkers have demonstrated in favour of women’s equal right to expose their bodies at will under the #freethenipple banner. Last week, New York Post’s Amber Jamieson worked “undercover” and topless for a day, concluding in a frontpage story that the controversy was “deeply sexist”. She was proudly joining Team Topless.\n“Women’s bodies don’t belong to themselves,” Saira says. “They always belong to someone else. They see us and they automatically think we’re gonna be a man’s commodity.”\nWhy does America have a problem with her exposing her own body to make money, she wonders aloud looking up at billboards above her, but not with Pepsi doing it systematically?\nThe idea that a female body needs an owner is also a problem for Chris Olivieri, 25, who orchestrates the venture. Because behind every empowered “desnuda”, it seems, is a man to hold their handbags, buy tampons and guard against inappropriate touches. Tabloids refer to them as handlers, or pimps.\n“Me being labelled a pimp, that’s the worst,” Olivieri says, visibly upset – he thinks of himself an artist and part of an arts movement.\nThe cops arrested him one evening shortly after De Blasio’s speech, on old trespass and marijuana charges, and quizzed him about his relationship with the performers (“Was he their pimp? Did they have threesomes? Did he solicit sex?”) until 3am. They kept his ID for four days, Olivieri says, and still have his cellphone.\nOlivieri’s Instagram feed is packed with cute pictures of the team together. In one shot, Saira and him are in a helicopter ride he treated her to (“She means a lot to me. If you got the best, you gotta give the best.”).\nA rapper by profession, he has just won a hip-hop competition and will take both ladies to an all-expenses-paid yacht party in Miami this weekend.\n“This is supposed to be the land of the free, but the government always tries to keep you at a certain level,” he says. “I’ve been doing this for four years and when media started coming after us, I realized that women have it just as hard as minorities do,” he says, adding that somehow they’re more vilified than the drug dealers a block away. “I’m all about equality. I respect the women more than I respect the men.”\nIn a small bag slung across his chest, he holds on to their tips: anything from a couple of dollars to twenties. In the middle of the walkway, a big red signpost informs that tipping street performers is optional.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Saira at work. Photograph: Caterina Clerici\n“How much is a photo?” a South Asian lady in shalwar kameez asks, her husband shyly observing Saira next to her.\n“ Accha tip,” Saira replies in improvised Hindi, avoiding specifics. “I learnt to say ‘a nice tip’ in a few different languages now.”\nThe team doesn’t talk about how much they make, and although it’s enough for Saira to take the chilly winter months off for vacation, she insists money is just a bonus.\nA body to be looked at and respected Around 6.30pm cops arrive to break up the scene, a little bit earlier than usual according to Saira. It’s dinnertime anyway, and Chris texts them the soup menu from a nearby restaurant: Manhattan clam chowder, barley vegetable or chicken orzo?\nJennifer Arnold, a middle-aged costume designer for Phantom of the Opera, comes up for a picture with Saira and Amanda. She pulls up her green top up to flash her own breasts, and people cheer.\n“I totally support these girls. Why can men do this when women can’t?” Jennifer says, nodding to the Naked Cowboy lurking a stone’s throw away. “It’s so sexist to persecute them and to let these guys go around behaving like that.”\nDespite De Blasio’s fear of corrupting minors, 12-year-old Gabriele Rizzelli from Italy poses comfortably with Saira and Amanda. As his mum smiles and tips, dad Angelo doesn’t see the problem: why wouldn’t nudity be child-friendly? It’s the family’s first day on their first visit to New York. In Europe, he says, this is no big deal.\nSaira often tries to tell parents exactly that.\n“Why don’t you give your son an opportunity to look at a woman’s body and understand that this is just a body?” she argues. “Why are you covering their eyes and making it seem like something shocking that they can’t see? What are you teaching them? You might as well give them an opportunity to understand the female body now, its just a body: it’s to be looked at and respected.”\nAnd speaking of respect, there are creeps, too. But mostly, people are well behaved: a gentle correction of a wandering hand is usually enough to shame its owner. Saira emphasises that she actually gets catcalled less here than when she’s off work, fully dressed – if anything, men often seem nervous as they awkwardly puts their arms around their bare waists.\nBreaking the rules gives everyone a bad name As the sun sets, Times Square regresses to its sleazier days as more and more shirtless women arrive. Carefully covering their nipples with robes until fully painted, they get ready in full view under neon lights.\nThey don’t belong to Saira’s clique: all from Latin America, some with huge silicone breasts, they catcall passersby, stroking them with feathers. In pictures, they arch their backs, kiss the tourists on the cheek, and shake their behinds. One of them recently got in trouble after offering oral sex to an undercover cop. None of them would comment for this article.\nBy breaking unwritten rules, these are the girls who give everyone a bad name, Saira complains. They’re not feminists; they don’t have an agenda. They’re copycats and theirs is not an empowering experience, she insists. On a Facebook page , she tries to set the record straight: the original “Painted Ladies” of Times Square are there to exercise their rights and celebrate their freedom by taking pictures with people from across the world.\nIf De Blasio had only bothered to come out here, he’d get the difference between her team and a few bad seeds, she argues. “People want us, believe it or not. I take a hundred pictures a day. I’m not forcing them to pull their phone out.”\nIn front of Times Square’s iconic billboards, Eric, a thirtysomething Pennsylvanian web developer in beige chinos and striped tucked-in shirt, wraps his arms around Amanda and Saira as they near the end of their workday.\nThe picture is for a friend back home, and while it may be objectifying, he doesn’t think it’s degrading. But is it empowering?\n“Without a doubt!” he says. “Otherwise I would never have done it. It’s inspiring to see someone with that much confidence.“", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441391784036/94a2f29d-a84d-49e7-a1a0-537e888795d5-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=de59342b8225d21c45cf41007b6980e9", "http://gothamist.com/2015/08/24/nypd_officers_took_painted_womens_c.php", "http://nypost.com/2015/09/03/times-square-desnuda-busted-for-offering-oral-sex-to-cop/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441391784036/94a2f29d-a84d-49e7-a1a0-537e888795d5-2060x1236.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=3169ad0bc8e86a02906978ef3821bb26", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c5gc%2Fsfb%23img-3&ref=responsive", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c5gc%2Fsfb%23img-2&ref=responsive", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=A+day+with+Saira%2C+one+of+the+original+topless+painted+ladies+of+New+York+City&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F05%2Fsaira-painted-lady-times-square-new-york-city&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F4%2F1441392214427%2F296753cb-c020-4e28-9fb4-34f01968b651-2060x1236.jpeg", "http://nypost.com/2015/08/30/i-went-undercover-as-a-topless-performer-in-times-square/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441391784036/94a2f29d-a84d-49e7-a1a0-537e888795d5-2060x1236.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=a43045e923c6ca5140ba435c6a3a0ac1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441392214427/296753cb-c020-4e28-9fb4-34f01968b651-2060x1236.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=18d47f57aeb717ae4dfccd959026dad2", "http://www.theatlantic.com/video/archive/2013/12/times-squares-naked-cowboy-and-cowgirl/282514/", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=A+day+with+Saira%2C+one+of+the+original+topless+painted+ladies+of+New+York+City&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F05%2Fsaira-painted-lady-times-square-new-york-city&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F4%2F1441391784036%2F94a2f29d-a84d-49e7-a1a0-537e888795d5-2060x1236.jpeg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441392214427/296753cb-c020-4e28-9fb4-34f01968b651-2060x1236.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=afbd60c334dbba016fd49aa903f64b8c", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Times-Square-Body-Art/952845111420898?fref=ts", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A+day+with+Saira%2C+one+of+the+original+topless+painted+ladies+of+New+York+City&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c5gc%2Fstw%23img-3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441392214427/296753cb-c020-4e28-9fb4-34f01968b651-2060x1236.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=67430ae581930b4411a870cba3397852", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441391784036/94a2f29d-a84d-49e7-a1a0-537e888795d5-2060x1236.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=890e6933559749f227ade7259a616291", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/4/1441392214427/296753cb-c020-4e28-9fb4-34f01968b651-2060x1236.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=99245cf3cf47a37860ee011e1d0235fc", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A+day+with+Saira%2C+one+of+the+original+topless+painted+ladies+of+New+York+City&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4c5gc%2Fstw%23img-2"], "published": "2015-09-05T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T17:26:36.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
