It adds new sectors as they become substantial, the latest being car-like MicroEVs homologated as quadricycles in Europe .\nIn the last year it has become a more closely integrated market - pure electric and hybrid whether on land, water or airborne. For example, Nissan has launched hybrid cars selling in tens of thousands yearly. The e-bike company Brammo has taken orders for 4,000 of its $20,000 record-breaking e-motorbike on its launch in the USA . Previously, e-motorbikes have been merely a curiosity.\nMany profitable niches are emerging just as the largest major sectors are changing in importance; the industrial and commercial sector is now bigger and much more profitable than e-cars, and is set to remain so for at least eight more years.\nAll components are changing with supercapacitors sometimes replacing or partly replacing batteries and also new types of battery, energy harvesting, power electronics and structure powering growth in this already huge and prosperous business. It is comprehensively forecasted only in this master report and the subsidiary reports on the segments. Disruptive change is now the norm and Apple-like inspiration and technological innovation is at last being seen.\nThe fruits of all this are truly spectacular; including such things as the Marian fast surface boat that acts as a submarine when necessary, the fixed-wing plane that will stay aloft for five years on sunshine and the flying jet ski. An amphibious hybrid plane is also going into production with military robot jellyfish, bats and swarming flies. The race is on to make extremely short take-off and landing (ESTL) personal planes and air taxis, some that take-off and land vertically in your garden or from the \"pocket airport\" on top of a regular airport building.\n10 year forecasts across all EV sectors\nThis report gives the unit numbers, average vehicle prices, and total value for ten years for the following vehicle types:\nHybrid cars\nPure electric cars\nHeavy industrial\nBuses\nLighting industrial/commercial\nMicro EV/quadricycle\nGolf car and motorized gold caddy\nMobility for the disabled\nTwo-wheel and allied\nMilitary\nMarine\nOther\nComprehensive applicational and geographic spread\nThis report is uniquely comprehensive in applicational and geographical spread. Primarily it presents statistics and forecasts including back up data such as conventional vehicle sales and market drivers. There is even comparative data such as statistics and forecasts by other analysts and by regional trade associations. There is some coverage of technology trends and considerable tabulation of manufacturers and by type of vehicle made and which are world leaders in value sales and why. There is little anecdotal text and information already available on the web, the illustrations and tables being largely original and deriving from IDTechEx analysis and private sources as well as extensive interviews.\nDownload the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/2516006/\nAbout Reportbuyer\nReportbuyer is a leading industry intelligence solution that provides all market research reports from top publishers\nhttp://www.reportbuyer.com\nFor more information:\nSarah Smith\nResearch Advisor at Reportbuyer.com\nEmail: query@reportbuyer.com\nTel: +44 208 816 85 48\nWebsite: www.reportbuyer.com\n releases/electric-vehicle-forecasts-trends-and-opportunities-2015-2025-300141396.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/2516006/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=BR98604&Transmission_Id=201509102010PR_NEWS_USPR_____BR98604&DateId=20150910", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/electric-vehicle-forecasts-trends-and-opportunities-2015-2025-300141396.html", "http://www.reportbuyer.com/"], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T04:44:09.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
