King Suites offer two of these desks – one in the bedroom and the other in the main lounge room...\n... with easy access to AC power from both and also a handy USB port at the lounge room desk for charging smartphones and tablets.\nAll up, we counted a staggering 24 vacant power points in our King Suite – or 25 when including the bathroom – so even if you completely reconfigure the furniture or are using the suite to host a very elaborate presentation, you're well and truly set for power.\nStandard Wi-Fi is also free for all guests and is capped at a usable but slow 1mbps for both upload and download, while a 'Premium' connection is available for $19.95/day for users who need higher speeds.\nHowever, that 'higher speed' is only 3mbps in each direction – slower than most normal ADSL, cable and 3G connections – but is complimentary for HHonors Gold and Diamond members.\n(As the $19.95 charge is still billed to your room, do make sure the costs are reversed before you leave: particularly if utilising express check-out which bypasses the front desk.)\nEat Guests booked in Queen Suites, King Suites and King Premier Suites enjoy free buffet breakfast at Adelphi Grill, as do HHonors Gold and Diamond members staying in any room type.\nThe buffet provides the usual yoghurts and pastries with a decent selection of cereals...\n... but also other items like crumbed fish and vegetables for travellers hankering for an early lunch – great if you've arrived in Perth from an overnight flight and ate breakfast several hours prior on the plane.\nFor an extra $7.50, or at no extra charge for Gold and Diamond members, other dishes are available to-order from the kitchen such as a light and fluffy pancake with maple syrup, butter, whipped cream and strawberries...\n... waffles, or Eggs Benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side.\nWith a two-night stay, waiter Jono remembered our preferred order from the day prior and offered it the next morning before we'd had the chance to ask – including our 'usual' latte, which was a nice touch.\nOn the downside, those barista-made coffees come at an extra charge regardless of your loyalty status – $3.80 for a regular cup or $4.80 for a large – but when the hotel far exceeds the basic 'continental breakfast' it's required to provide for Gold/Diamond guests, a few dollars for a nice coffee is nothing in the grand scheme of things.\n(If you'd prefer not to pay the extra, the wait staff will happily provide filtered coffee free-of-charge.)\nWe also took advantage of the $20 lunch special – pairing either a burger, sandwich or fish with chips and a soft drink, beer or cider – and weren't disappointed...\n... nor were we with the room service steak sandwich the following day:\nThe complimentary HHonors drink voucher provided on check-in was put to good use at the bar where it joined an impressive cheese plate...\n... which, coincidentally, was also $20, and larger than the photograph makes it appear.\nRelax Your room key unlocks a 24-hour gym with a solid selection of cardio equipment, free weights and other gear...\n... along with the outdoor pool, complete with chairs and sunlounges:\nCertainly, there's no Executive Lounge here in Perth to relax of an evening, but on considering what I'd normally use the lounge for – daily breakfast, working space with WiFi, snacks and a drink after work – I'm not left wanting much.\nWhen it comes to breakfast, that's covered by a free bite in the hotel's restaurant and free cooked-to-order dishes for Gold/Diamond guests, which is actually more generous than you'll typically find in Hilton-brand Executive Lounges where they do exist.\nThat leaves somewhere to work: a gap I filled by setting up a sizeable office on the suite's dining table rather than using the smaller working desks; and snacks, for which the welcome plate did nicely.\nThen there's an evening glass of wine – covered, at least for one night, by the complimentary HHonors drink voucher – and WiFi, for which Gold members can use the Premium option at no cost: a perk normally restricted to Diamond guests.\nSo while an Executive Lounge is indeed absent, the service and amenities are all still there – you just need to know where to look.\nAlso read: Hilton Melbourne South Wharf hotel review", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T07:27:36.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
