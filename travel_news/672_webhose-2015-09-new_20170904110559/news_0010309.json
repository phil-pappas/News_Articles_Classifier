He also hosted the TV show “Locals” on sports network Outside Television. \nRoner’s death comes four months after world-famous wingsuit flyer Dean Potter and fellow adventurer Graham Hunt fatally crashed after the pair leaped from Taft Point, 1,000 metres above Yosemite Valley, attempting to clear a V-shaped notch in a ridgeline. \nRoner is survived by his wife and two children, according to the Squaw Valley Institute.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:35:27.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
