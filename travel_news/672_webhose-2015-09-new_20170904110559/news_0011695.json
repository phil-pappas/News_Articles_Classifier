Journal News)\n19 CONNECT 57 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE TARRYTOWN, N.Y. — The Tappan Zee Bridge was a poster child for congestion long before construction of its replacement started two years ago.\nNow with so much to gawk at in the Hudson River, the 3-mile drive across the span seems to drag on even longer. That's true in September because traffic volume may be higher in summer but fall concentrates the congestion during rush hours, said Jennifer Givner, New York State Thruway Authority spokeswoman.\n\"Generally, the traffic volume over the Tappan Zee Bridge is about the same or slightly lower in September as compared to the peak tourism months over the summer,\" she said. About 134,000 vehicles cross the bridge every day, and southbound two-axle passenger vehicles on Interstate 87 pay $5 for the privilege without discounts; northbound has no toll.\nA new $4 billion Tappan Zee Bridge is being constructed several yards north of the existing bridge and is expected to be completed in 2017.\nUSA TODAY\nTake me to the river: America's best waterside drives\nHere are five things you'll face as you cross the bridge this Labor Day weekend and into the fall:\n1. Rubbernecking. \"It's frustrating when you look over and see other drivers take out their phones to take pictures of the bridge,\" said Thomas Mannion, 39, who sees such behavior as he makes his way from his home in Palisades, N.Y., to his job in Port Chester.\n“It's frustrating when you look over and see other drivers take out their phones to take pictures of the bridge.”\nThomas Mannion, Palisades, N.Y. But Sgt. William Collins of New York State Police doesn't think gawkers will be a major problem during peak hours after the first few days of back-to-school commuters.\n\"People who drive it every day, they see it and get used to it,\" he said.\nMannion said the key for him to avoid delays in traffic is to get to the bridge by 7 a.m. ET.\n2. The sun. Heading east over the bridge, southbound on I-87, during the morning rush can be blinding. The sun is in your eyes from Spring Valley, N.Y., all the way to the bridge, Collins said.\nThe sun rises around 6:25 a.m. these days and will advance by a minute each day until Oct. 31, or Halloween, when it appears at 7:25 a.m. When Daylight Saving Time ends Nov. 1, sunrise ticks back to 6:26 a.m.\n3. The \"twist.\" In the afternoon, as drivers head west across the bridge, they encounter a tight curve and narrow lanes that can make the roadway feel like a race course, said Jim Morris of Airmont, N.Y., who has been commuting over the Tappan Zee for two decades but is relocating to Texas.\n\"When you got a big truck next to you, it makes it tough,\" he said.\nUSA TODAY\nMassive Tappan Zee crane makes first lift\n4. Gridlock. A study from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute and the traffic data company INRIX called the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut region the fourth most gridlocked in the nation.\nTravel delays cost every commuter $1,739 annually, including wasting 35 gallons of gas, which ranks the New York metro area at the top of the national list.\nWith summer unofficially over, expect jammed-packed rush hours to return to the Tappan Zee Bridge, seen here Aug. 27, 2015.

Right before the holiday weekend, nightly from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. Monday to Wednesday, crews will be shutting down lanes on the bridge to collect tolls electronically from Tappan Zee drivers in South Nyack, N.Y.\nThe work will require closing up to three southbound lanes approaching Exit 11 in South Nyack.\nBut under the new system, drivers won't have to slow down to pay tolls. Money will be collected via E-ZPass, or car owners will be mailed a bill based on photo records of their license plates.\nAbout 25 million trips requiring a toll are made across the bridge annually; 80% of drivers use E-ZPass payments. All-electronic toll collection is expected to begin in the spring.\n19 CONNECT 57 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1EwRoZp TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766433041246457-083115tappan-zee-traffic.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EwRoZp&text=5%20things%20you%20need%20to%20know%20about%20Tappan%20Zee%20Bridge%20work&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/99f96f869d26798386fc523a0b3bbd5b719a6041/c=0-49-2399-1404&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/05/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635678067859312436-Bear-Mountain-Bridge-Hudson-River-from-Bear-Mountain-State-Park-HV-0807-.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1EwRoZp", "http://lohud.us/1EwtJZd", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1dd9b1bc6031fd6d5f4ac58276b33ad355c3df87/c=367-0-2773-1809&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766433041246457-083115tappan-zee-traffic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766433057470561-083115Traffic-lead-vertical.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cfd01b4e1a3faa73a4834598cb2c5678a44daaae/c=204-0-1428-1224/local/-/media/Westchester/2015/04/24/B9317080547Z.1_20150424205934_000_G7PAJIGL1.1-0.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EwRoZp&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d6baef3c5af44738a701f761d1e7bc7f0beca386/c=0-246-2997-4241&r=183&c=0-0-180-238/local/-/media/2015/08/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/635766433057470561-083115Traffic-lead-vertical.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-01T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:27:48.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
