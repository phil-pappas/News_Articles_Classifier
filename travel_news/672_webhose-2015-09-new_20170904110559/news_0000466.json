Calling an organisation a human rights violator is much stronger than disagreeing with it — it is a claim that it has broken the law and presumably must be punished.\nThe commission does not have the power to punish Sadtu and probably wouldn’t act even if it did. But the DA’s complaint suggests that it would punish Sadtu if it could. The union’s \"crime\" is refusing to co-operate with the Department of Basic Education’s annual national assessment (ANA), which tests pupil competencies in an attempt to check whether schooling is effective.\nThe first problem with the DA’s complaint is that it is selective. Sadtu is not the only teacher’s union opposing the ANA — all teachers’ unions, including those that are not remotely \"militant\", are against ANA. Sadtu is being singled out because it is the only union that belongs to the Congress of South African Trade Unions and is therefore allied with the ANC. So, in the DA’s book, whether you are a human rights violator does not depend on what you do, but who you are — and whether you are linked to its political opponents.\nSecond, it is an attempt to close down debate on how to fix our schools. A look at the unions’ objections to the ANA shows that their only \"crime\" is to disagree with the department’s view that the ANA is helping schools to function better. The National Professional Teachers’ Association, which is politically unaffiliated, says it supported the ANA but no longer believes that it identifies the problems in schools in a way that enables them to be solved. Academic specialists on schooling say the unions’ points highlight issues that need to be debated.\nSo, whether the unions are right or wrong, they are making a considered contribution to the debate on school reform. They are doing what they should do — taking a position on what is good for pupils and doing everything they can within the law to win the argument. Whatever our position on the ANA, we should be cheering the fact that the department is being held to account and that a strategy to improve schooling is the subject of debate.\nThe DA’s response suggests that it supports free debate only when the debaters agree with it — a position it shares, ironically, with the department which, cheered on by sections of the media, has accused the unions of \"staging a coup\" simply because they oppose it. Instead of criticising its intolerance, the DA has joined the witch hunt.\nWhy? Because this is consistent with a simplistic account of what is wrong in our schools, which appeals to the DA and some commentators, not because the evidence supports it but because it fits their prejudices. In this view, the only thing wrong with schools is Sadtu, which is portrayed as a Mafia dedicated only to protecting corrupt and incompetent teachers. This mythology blames the education department only for not showing Sadtu who is boss — precisely what it is trying to do now.\nIt ignores research showing that relations between the department and teachers’ unions are a huge problem — but that the department’s attitude to teachers is at least as much of a problem as teachers’ attitude to it. In this view, the department, like many national politicians, does not take teachers’ concerns seriously — it simply labels them part of the problem.\nThat does seem to be confirmed by the constant resort to slogans that reduce the problem to ensuring that teachers are \"in class, on time, teaching\", which never seems to fix anything because it oversimplifies the problem. If we consider the negative stereotypes about teachers in the national debate, it is a wonder anyone competent takes up school teaching — it certainly cannot be because they expect respect.\nGiven all of this, it seems plausible to insist that teachers and their unions are not the only problem.\nThe DA’s response suggests that none of these subtleties interest it much. It likes its simplistic story about Sadtu because it conforms to a wider suburban prejudice in which unions are always the villains and employers — even when they are political opponents — always the good guys. It also makes good headlines in a toxic climate in which \"effective opposition\" is yelling suburban prejudices loudly rather than offering well-reasoned alternatives. No matter that this simplifies problems and makes solutions more difficult: the goal is to reduce problems to a cheap morality play, not to solve them.\nSo it is no accident that the DA believes the solution to the schools problem is mobilising a suburban prejudice to close down a political opponent — this fits our political climate far more closely than a serious attempt to understand the problem and suggestive workable solutions.\n• Friedman is director of the Centre for the Study of Democracy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:25:06.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
