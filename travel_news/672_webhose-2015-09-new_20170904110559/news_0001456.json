Executive manager commercial Simon Dickson said the unseasonably low temperatures have brought an unexpected dumping of high quality snow. \"Extensive skiable terrain and a 2.8-metre snow base means we've had some of the best skiing and riding conditions at Whakapapa for a number of years,\" he said. MetService have forecast a cooler September than usual, with a drier period towards the end of the month. \"It's definitely been a cold start,\" said MetService meteorologist Claire Flynn.
