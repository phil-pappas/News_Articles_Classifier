A desert dreamscape of feral winds and rusted iron. Out here, a belligerent heat surrounds you, letting you know that you are an unwelcome presence. Seen through squinted eyes, the horizon stretches to a binary bandwidth of scorched earth and death-ray sky. “Welcome to Bodie – population 0,” the sign says. Over the years, time’s attrition rained heavy blows on the economy, the people, and the town, itself. Now, about 70 years since the last and hardiest left for good, the fragile remnants of society are all that are left, and they continue to unravel in the blistering heat. Stores, coffins, homes, tools, petrol pumps, saloons, cash registers, children’s prams; each an abandoned memento of daily life, all now starved of care and of function. • Abandoned towns of the world With its empty buildings of slatted wood and lace curtain, the town resembles a three-dimensional sepia photograph, its lifeblood long since drained. I peer through the blurry window of a hardware store and see stock items still on display, their original value reduced to prop status, but still a potent forebear of modern life. The town has become a tourist attraction Photo: Fotolia/AP Unsurprisingly, personal effects provide the most moving window on the past. A madam’s mirror and hairbrush, a love letter in an elegant hand, or a Chinese opium pipe. These ordinary items reveal extraordinary lives, carved into the American West, yet powered by thoughts and hopes no different from our own. Even in broad daylight, with two dozen people exploring as you are, the ghosts of Bodie are all around, benign, patient, waiting for you to leave. Devoid of life it may be, but the buildings and objects of Bodie are still coveted, still loved, and they belong to the ghosts themselves; discarded as you walk in the room, reclaimed when the last tourist leaves. • Places where nature won At the end of the day, our bags and pockets are checked for anything native to the surrounding soil, anything that might (accidentally, or otherwise) find its way home as a keepsake. Even grit from the sole of a shoe is removed. There is no security, simply a self-imposed vigilance against “Bodie’s curse”. Legend has it that, as the town died, misfortune seeped into the fabric of all that remained. Over the years, hundreds of parcels and letters have arrived in Bodie from all across the globe, each returning a cursed trophy, each telling a bad luck story. When the time comes, we leave empty-handed, but with the feeling that while Bodie is a genuine ghost town, it’s the life stories, and not the ghost stories, that will haunt us the longest.
