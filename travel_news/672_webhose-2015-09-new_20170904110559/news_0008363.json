Here's the obligatory photo of a Bavarian lady in traditional costume Photo: AP Photo/Matthias Schrader Late booking specialists lastminute.com is still offering deals to get to this year’s Oktoberfest, alongside a few handy tips as to what to do when you are there. According to the company’s recent research, this coming Monday (September 28) could be the one of the best days to head out to the Bavarian capital with return flights from London and one night in a four-star hotel going for as little as £219 per person. For those who can’t drop everything to get away at the start of the working week, next weekend - the culmination of the fortnight’s revelry, is also a good option: the party will still be going but most foreign visitors will have returned home. “In the two weeks of the Oktoberfest, millions of visitors from across the world will join in the fun. If you can, go on a morning during the week and avoid the peak times over the weekend (especially the middle weekend),” a statement from lastminute.com advised. You could be at Oktoberfest on Monday for as little as £219 Photo: GETTY “The locals love the last weekend of the Oktoberfest since this is when most tourists have left, and the chance of a relaxing day on the Wiesn is significantly improved.” More broadly, lastminute.com’s research has revealed that the average cost for a one-night city break to Munich during Oktoberfest this year with flights from London and a night in a central four-star hotel is £288 per person, three per cent less than in 2014. Hotel prices in the city in general have been lower this year than last and the cheapest night for a hotel-only stay would be Sunday September 27, with the cost of a night in a central Munich four-star hotel could be as low as £71.

Top tips/facts * You get the most beer for your money in the ‘Hacker tent’ this year with 0.94 liters of beer per stein. * Most tents stop the music at 10pm – so if you’re in the mood to keep the party going, head to the Käferschänke or the Weinzelt - both are open until 1am. * Extending over some 5,500 square metres, the Pschorr Brau-Rosl tent offered a staggering 12,000 people space in 1913, and is thus the largest Oktoberfest beer tent of all time. With space for 10,000 guests, the Hofbräu tent is currently the largest beer tent at the Oktoberfest. * The tapping of the first barrel of beer of each Oktoberfest originated in 1950 with the then Munich major Thomas Wimmer. The former major Christian Ude needed, on his first appearance, a whopping seven strokes to tap the barrell. With practice he later succeeded with only two strokes, the current record. * The highest recorded number of visitors at Oktoberfest was 7.1 million, in 1985. In recent years the figure has been just over six million.
