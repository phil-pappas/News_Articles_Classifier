The number of golf courses in Vietnam has doubled to 36 in the past five years and by 2020 that number is expected to have more than tripled to 110.\nBeautiful new courses bear the names of former champions who are credited with their design. Close to the central Vietnamese city of Danang, a strip now referred to as Golf Coast Vietnam includes Greg Norman’s Danang Golf Club, Nick Faldo’s Laguna Lang Co, Colin Montgomerie’s Montgomerie Links Vietnam and the latest, Luke Donald’s Ba Na Hills, which is due to open later this year. The three established courses look as if they have been part of the scenery for many years yet the oldest, Montgomerie, was opened less than five years ago.\nWhile golf may be a great pastime for government officers, it is also a boon for local economies providing employment for hundreds of staff. Danang Golf Club, designed by Greg Norman. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nIn Vietnam the cost of a round of golf, on average about $A170 a game, includes a cart and a female caddie. For a casual visitor, the knowledge of a local caddie is invaluable and can make the difference between a good or indifferent experience.\nWearing green tartan trews, a line of caddies greets our group of players with a joint “hello” as we pull up at Montgomerie Links in Danang.\nStanding next to my clubs is Lien, who calls my name. From the moment we make eye contact, I know I’m in competent hands.\nLien is a married mother who lives near the third hole at Montgomerie. Wayward balls landing on the roof often disturb the peace of her household.\nDuring the four hours we spend together she offers encouraging and accurate advice that not only makes my game more enjoyable but improves my scorecard. She plays herself, which shows in her knowledge of the game.\nAt one point before she hands me my club she demonstrates the shot I must play, a tricky pitch. I copy her and make a successful shot almost to the pin.\nThere’s encouragement for a good shot (“now we’re rocking”) and commiserations for a bad one (“not so bad”). My caddie is funny and warm. She plonks her coolie hat on my head and takes a photo with my phone. Danang Golf Club. Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied\nI learn a lot from Lien and not all of it about golf. In general, Vietnamese caddies have a lively sense humour, a good knowledge of the game and in this area they speak proficient English.\nBest of all they can make a game on a difficult course with tricky greens into a pleasant memory.\nAbout 60km north of Danang is the Laguna Golf Club at Lang Co which opened in 2013. It is set in dense jungle that runs from steep hills to the edge of the calm blue waters of Lang Co Bay.\nDuring the Vietnam War the Americans dropped so many bombs here they referred to the area as the bowling alley. Unexploded weaponry was a major issue during the building of the course and an ordnance team was brought in to help clear the site.\nThe naturally rugged golf course with its sandy wastelands is as challenging as it is wildly beautiful.\nIt takes less than an hour to get to Laguna from Danang but as the course is worth playing more than once, stay at the nearby luxury Banyan Tree or sister resort Angsana where half of the 229 suites have their own plunge pool. The side-by-side resorts line a 3km-long private beach at Lang Co which is a lovely spot to be as the sun rises.\nMost of the 80,000 people in the local area live off the sea. In the town of Lang Co, local restaurants built out over the bay are a great place to stop off for a lunch of delicious dishes of fresh clams, prawns, crabs and squid.\nJust over the hill from Lang Co is the new Ba Na course which is due to open later this year. The course is it set in a mountain valley rather than by the sea. Happy caddies at Danang Golf Club, Danang, Vietnam. Picture: Susan Bredow Source: Supplied\nLuke Donald’s first course design is expected to be challenging with plenty of bunkers and undulating greens.\nJust 20 minutes from Danang Airport and next door to Montgomerie Links Vietnam is Danang Golf Club.\nThe Norman-designed course runs through sand dunes and stands out for having one of the most beautiful holes on Vietnam’s Golf Coast. The 12th at Danang is a total surprise, coming out of a valley to a picture-perfect par 3 with a lovely sea view beyond the green.\nAdjacent to a nearby sand bunker is another kind of bunker – a historical remnant from the French war fought in Vietnam between 1946 and 1954.\nToday the only wars fought here are between golf players and their skills.\nThe writer was a guest of Golf Asian and Vietnam Airlines.\nGO2\nDANANG\nGETTING THERE\nVietnam Airlines has daily flights from Sydney and Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) with connections to Danang.
