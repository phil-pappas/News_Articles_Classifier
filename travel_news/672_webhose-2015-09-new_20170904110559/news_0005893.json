Burning Man participants are busily decorating, bedazzling and otherwise dialing in their tents, sun shelters and RV encampments - some with paid staff and private toilets - for a week completely off the grid. \"You see all these piles of stuff and you have no idea what it is at first,\" said Adam Kelso of Denver. \"It's amazing to see the city come alive.\" And alive it is, with a population ultimately estimated to reach 70,000 people. The encampment will grow over the rest of the week, peak at the weekend, and then vanish back onto the sands for another year. There's no Wi-Fi access at the event, and what little cell phone service existed has been completely overwhelmed by the thousands of people pouring into the area after battling traffic jams lasting for more than eight hours on Sunday night. The arcing street system is teeming with bike riders, each on a machine more bedecked than the last, along with decorated golf carts and elaborate buses that have been turned into mobile dance parties. The light breeze blew through streamers and windmills, beaded curtains and camp flags as costumed participants wove past each other on those decorated bikes. \nLUXURY CAMPS \nFamous DJs are expected, as usual, to perform at the event's legendary all-night dance parties, and participants are well aware the guests of honor won't likely won't be staying in tents. Instead, people willing to fork over US$20,000 (NZ$31,434) or more are staying in so-called luxury camps managed by professionals. JIM URQUHART/REUTERS \nDenise S, (L) and Richard S. utilise an art installation during the Burning Man 2015 \"Carnival of Mirrors\" arts and music festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada. \nThe camps are supposed to be less exclusive than the plug-and-play camps that drew headlines last year, and Burning Man organizers changed the rules to make them more welcoming to the general public. \nLuxury camps are recognizable by their ranks of neatly parked RV and motor coaches, their private toilets and armies of paid staff prepared to serve. \nThose camps area for only a few, and most people are staying in tents or small RVs. \nLos Angeles bartender Andrew Mitchell said he was supposed to work one of the luxury camps but the arrangement didn't work out, but he came anyway. Taking a break as he helped Mitchell erect a simple shelter made of stiff building insulation sealed with metallic tape, Jeremy Wisuthseriwong said he'd always wanted to see what Burning Man was all about. \nThe two learned how to make their shelter from watching YouTube videos, and hoped it would be sturdy enough to last the week while providing shelter from the sun while napping during the daytime. \n\"We both turned 30 and decided it was time to jump out here,\" Wisuthseriwong said. \nTNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T11:46:05.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
