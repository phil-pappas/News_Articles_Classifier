Published on : Monday, September 21, 2015\nKaravalli, The Gateway Hotel Residency Road Bangalore’s iconic restaurant that serves authentic South Western Indian Coastal delicacies, brings a fascinating experience to food enthusiasts at Clubhouse, Taj Club House. This all-day diner welcomes guests to savour a rich variety of food from Karavalli inspired by best of the Mangalorean Bunts and Konkanis, Kodavas from Coorg, Malayalees, Calicut Muslims and Syrian Christians of Travancore, Havyaka Brahmins of Vitla and the Portuguese of Goa.\nCelebrating its 25th anniversary, Karavalli reflects the culinary legacy of the coastal regions of south west India with its authentic well-researched home-food recipes infused with a refreshed blend of novel additions. Chef Ganesh Sheregar from Karavalli will showcase his culinary craft and creative cuisine to guests at Clubhouse with a carefully designed menu including the Oggaraneda Aritha Pundi (Steamed rice dumplings, flavored with coconut and cumin); Koli Barthad (Succulent pieces of chicken, pan- fried in a blend of roasted spices and the tart flavours of Coorg vinegar); Allapuzha Meen Curry (Cubes of Seer Fish, simmered in a moderately spiced gravy of freshly ground coconut, ginger and raw mangoes); Kori Gassi (Tender pieces of chicken, cooked with finely ground fresh coconut, byadgi chillies, coriander and tamarind); and Pachakkari Stew (Seasonal vegetables gently simmered in creamy coconut milk). No Indian meal is complete without dessert; we recommend the special Elaneer Payasam (chilled tender coconut pudding).\nEnjoy the flavours of the south-western coast from Karavalli at Clubhouse!\nSeptember 18 – 27, 2015\nLunch: A la carte | Average price INR 1100 inclusive of taxes\nDinner Buffet: Average price INR 1700 inclusive of taxes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T08:41:21.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
