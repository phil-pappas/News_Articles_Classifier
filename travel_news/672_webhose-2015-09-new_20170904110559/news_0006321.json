Gabay was shot in the head at about 3:45 a.m. in the Flatbush neighborhood, reported WABC-TV. \nAccording to what the TV station was told, Gabay was walking with his brother, and as they passed by people who were having an argument, shots rang out, and Gabay was shot in the head by at least one bullet. He remains in critical condition at a nearby hospital. Another man, not yet identified, was killed. \nAccording to police, no arrests have made been. This shooting on parade day is just one of several violent acts that have occurred around the event. Previously, a 24-year-old man was stabbed to death in the early morning hours on parade day at Grand Army Plaza. Last year, a man recently released from prison shot into the crowd that killed one man wounded others. The year prior, a 1-year-old boy was shot dead in his stroller at the parade from a bullet meant for his father. \nThis year’s parade went on as planned with hundreds of thousands of people in attendance along Eastern Parkway. \nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo released the following statement: \n\"Early this morning, Carey Gabay - a member of our administration - was shot in Brooklyn. Carey is now in critical condition at Kings County Hospital. Carey is First Deputy General Counsel at Empire State Development and was formerly an Assistant Counsel to the Governor. \n\"Carey is an outstanding public servant who joined our administration in 2011. He is a Harvard-educated lawyer who works for the State because he wants to give back to others and make a difference. He is just 43 years old and is a kind-hearted man. Carey is a friend to all who have the pleasure of meeting him. I ask that New Yorkers join us by keeping him, his wife, Trenelle, and his family in their prayers at this time. \n\"This tragic shooting - this one by another seemingly random bullet - is the latest heartbreaking reminder that the crime of gun violence must stop. Enough young, innocent people have died, and it must stop now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:18:43.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
