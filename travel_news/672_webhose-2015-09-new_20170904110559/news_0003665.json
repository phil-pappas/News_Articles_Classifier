However, a total of 7,083,813 German tourists visited Spain in the first eight months of the year; a decrease of 0.4% on 2014.\nThe Nordic markets maintained their position as the fourth emitting market for Spain with 3,323,311 tourists between January and August.

A total of 362,722 tourists visited Spain from the Nordic markets in August, an increase of 0.1% on August 2014.\nWith 12,119,491 tourists in the first eight months of the year, Catalonia was the top destination region for tourists visiting Spain while, with 8,726,760 tourists between January and August (up 3.1%), the Balearic Islands accounted for 23.9% of the total.\nThe Canary Islands maintained growth of 1% with 7,595,694 inbound tourists – the most moderate of all the main destination regions while the Region of Valencia was visited by 4,605,052 tourists in the first eight months of the year, an increase of 4.4% and 10.6% of the total.\nIn August, almost one million tourists (979,261) visited the Region of Valencia, an increase of 6.3% in the month.
