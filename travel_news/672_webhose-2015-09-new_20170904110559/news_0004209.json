Image 13 of 13 New things to do, places to stay in Hawaii 1 / 13 gallery_overlay_close|article-gallery-6484486|article-gallery-6484486|0 \nHow much does the West Coast like Hawaii? \nEnough that 3.25 million of us flew there last year — out of a record 8.28 million visitors in total — and spent $5 billion, or more than a third of the total $14.7 billion in visitor expenditures, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority . \nMore of us will be on the way this fall, once Virgin America begins daily nonstop flights from San Francisco to Honolulu on Nov. 2 and to Maui on Dec. 3. Over the course of a year, Virgin America estimates that its passengers will drop another $139 million in the Aloha State. \nFortunately, Hawaii offers lodging, dining and activities to suit nearly any budget, plus plenty of opportunities to stray far from crowds (please tread lightly and safely, though). There’s also always something new to explore; see below for highlights. \nSpeaking of exploring, if you see one of the many Protect Mauna Kea sign-waving demonstrators around the islands, feel free to ask about their objections to further observatory development atop Hawaii’s highest mountain. Your views may differ, but anyone can appreciate Native Hawaiians’ deep connection to this aina , or land, so many love to visit. \nOahu \nThings to do: The last major island to offer zip lines has two of the best as well as the newest courses. Climb Works Keana Farms now provides eight dual zips and an educational tour from a ridge overlooking the farm and North Shore beaches. Kualoa Ranch’s Treetop Canopy tour includes seven zips and walks through the rain forest, where guests learn about native plants and movies shot at the ranch, including “Jurassic World.” \nIn Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii Ocean Adventures offers a half-day Hawaiian sailing canoe trip from Heeia State Park, with a free shuttle from Waikiki; proceeds benefit park and youth programs. Also on the Windward Side, Sea Life Park has transformed its Shark Trek Adventure, removing a fence that separated guests from the pelagics, and focusing on sharks’ role in Native Hawaiian culture; the park has also doubled the size of its interactive Touch Pool. \nLooking for freebies? Admission is free to the Royal Hawaiian’s display of vintage Matson Navigation Co. travel posters in its Coronet Lounge, through April. The Hawaii State Art Museum has a new exhibition featuring its Art in Public Places collections; the free museum also stays open late the first Friday of the month, with live music from 6 to 9 p.m. \nOn the last Friday of the month, enjoy concerts with no cover charge in the Banyan Courtyard at the Moana Surf rider; local bands start at 5 p.m. and top Hawaiian music recording artists perform from 7 to 9 p.m. \nDining: Locavore chef Ed Kenney now runs three restaurants in Kaimuki. Mud Hen Water (a translation of waialae ) opened in June on Waialae Avenue, across the street from his Town restaurant and next to his informal Kaimuki Superette lunch place. \nSpring also saw the arrival of Bread+Butter, a cafe by day and tapas bar by night, behind the Ala Moana Center , and Mark Noguchi ’s locally inspired lunch spot, the Mission Social Hall & Cafe, at the Hawaiian Mission Houses Museum . \nThe opening of the Honolulu Coffee Experience Center , a 9,000-square-foot educational gallery in Waikiki with on-site roastery and bakery-cafe, has been postponed until Oct. 1. \nAlso due later this fall: a Tommy Bahama Restaurant, Bar & Store at the Waikiki Beach Walk, and Bellini Bistro & Bar at the Ward Center . No word if the latter will sell oversize aloha shirts, too. \nLodging: While the opening of the island’s first Four Seasons — in Ko Olina, replacing the former Ihilani — has been pushed back till spring, numerous new or refurbished rooms can be found. \nAmong budget properties, Ohia Waikiki, formerly the Outrigger Surf East, is being upgraded under new management by Aqua Hospitality; all 251 rooms and suites (from $171) include kitchenettes with four-burner stoves and ovens. The first Hilton Garden Inn on the island is due to open in early 2016, after an extensive makeover of the old Ohana Waikiki West. \nOn the North Shore, the recently opened Courtyard Oahu North Shore by Marriott, built on the site of the old Laie Inn , offers 144 rooms (from $259). It’s next to the popular Polynesian Cultural Center and close to the rural Windward Side’s beaches and farms. Up the road, the newly eco-friendly, surf-themed Turtle Bay Resort has reopened its deluxe beach cottages. \nMore than $150 million in renovations has given several major Waikiki hotels fresh looks. The patterns and colors of kapa (dyed bark cloth) inspired the latest decor throughout the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk by Hilton, from carpets to bed scarves to artwork, and even the tower’s exterior. \nEarlier this year, the Hilton Hawaiian Village completed the renovation of rooms in the 17-story Diamond Head Tower, with hues and prints inspired by indigenous arts. The Hyatt Regency Waikiki Resort & Spa’s refurbishment of its 1,230 rooms, wrapped up in spring, focused on modern amenities including pillow-top beds, bidet toilets and outlet pods. \nMeanwhile, the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa will cap “beautification” of its public spaces with the completion this fall of a 60-by-20-foot carved wood panel honoring Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii’s last monarch. Honolulu artist Kaiwi Nui Yoon began work on the resort’s centerpiece, incorporating elements such as the Kumulipo creation chant and pili grass, in March. \nMaui \nThings to do: Surf without worrying about falling off the board on the new two-hour canoe surfing session from Kihei’s Hawaiian Paddle Sports. Up to three guests (from $119) and a steering guide ride the waves in a four-person outrigger canoe; locations vary based on conditions. \nOr enter the ocean gently in one of cultural ambassador Kainoa Horcajo ’s new free programs at the Grand Wailea. He teaches guests a chant to greet the dawn before an ocean dip at 6 a.m. the third Thursday of the month, and leads tours of the resort’s cultural sites at 10 a.m. Wednesdays. \nMauiWine (formerly Tedeschi Vineyards) offers three daily guided tours of the estate, with complimentary tastings, at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. \nOne of many free island events, the Maui Ukulele Festival on Oct. 11 offers headline performances by Herb Ohta Sr. (Ohta-San) and Jake Shimabukuro, along with music by artists of all ages, food stands and craft booths, from 1 to 6 p.m. at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center in Kahului. There’s a free ukulele workshop at 10 a.m. \nDining: Across the road from MauiWine, Ulupalakua Ranch & Grill now stays open till 5 p.m. — more time to try its Maui Cattle Co. beef brisket or lamb burgers. \nThose who don’t have time to drive (or fly) to Hana can sample its bounty in Paia. Hana Ranch Provisions opened last month and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner daily, showcasing ingredients from Hana Ranch’s certified organic farm and ranch in East Maui. A small market sells fresh produce. \nNearby, Mama’s Fish House now takes reservations from 11 a.m. on, allowing diners to head straight to their table from the plane. \nLodging: Sorry, kids — the recently renovated Hotel Wailea is now an adults-only resort, all the better to enjoy cocktails at the Cabanas, the redesigned pool area. A tree-house spa room is due by the end of the year, and a full spa by next June. \nAll facilities at Travaasa Hana, Maui, remain open during its $12 million makeover of all 70 bungalows and suites, set for completion at the end of the year. Among other improvements, rooms will feature redesigned baths, photographs of Hana and furnishings from sustainable materials and kapa cloth — but no TVs, clocks or radios, in keeping with tradition. \nThere’s just one suite at the new G and Z Upcountry Bed & Breakfast in Kula, but it’s quite a spread for $149 a night, with a king bed, living room with queen sofabed, fully equipped kitchen and private entrance — and no cleaning fee. Guests can tour the adjacent 6-acre fruit and vegetable farm; if they plant something in the nursery, the owners will send them updates as it grows ( www.gandzmaui.com). \nSpeaking of breaking ground, construction has started on the 390-unit Westin Nanea Ocean Villas in Kaanapali, due to open in 2017. Next door, Honua Kai is offering a discount for its villas with a view of the construction. \nFrommer’s Hawaii co-author Jeanne Cooper writes frequently about Hawaii for The San Francisco Chronicle and SFGate.
