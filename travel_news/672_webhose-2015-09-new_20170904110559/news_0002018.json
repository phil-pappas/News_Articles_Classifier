The Big Island of Hawaii is entirely formed by volcanic activity. There are five separate volcanoes which have, over the past million-or-so years, combined to form the island.\nThe map above indicates the names and locations of the volcanoes which make up the Big Island of Hawaii. Of these five volcanoes, one is considered to be extinct and in transition between its postshield and erosional stage, one is considered dormant and the three remaining volcanoes are categorized as active. Kohala Kohala Volcano is the oldest of volcanoes that form the Big Island of Hawaii, having emerged from the sea more than 500,000 years ago. Over 200,000 years ago it is believed that an enormous landslide removed the volcano's northeast flank forming the amazing sea cliffs that mark this part of the island. The height of the summit has reduced over time by over 1,000 meters.\nOver the centuries, Kohala has continued to sink and lava flows from its two much larger neighbors, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa have buried the southern part of the volcano. Kohala is today considered to be an extinct volcano. Mauna Kea \nMauna Kea, which in Hawaiian means \"White Mountain\", is the tallest of Hawaii's volcanoes and in fact the tallest mountain in the world if measured from the floor of the ocean to its summit. It received its name, no doubt, because snow is frequently seen on the summit even from the distant shores. The snow occasionally reaches several feet deep. \nThe summit of Mauna Kea is home to numerous observatories. It is considered one of the best places to view the heavens from the surface of the planet. Several tour companies offer evening trips to the summit of Mauna Kea to view the sunset and then view the stars. \nThe Onizuka Center for International Astronomy , located near the summit, is an excellent place to learn more about the history of the mountain and the work done by the observatories. \nMauna Kea is categorized as a dormant volcano, having last erupted about 4,500 years ago. However, Mauna Kea is likely to erupt again someday. The periods between eruptions of Mauna Kea are long compared to those of the active volcanoes. Hualalai \nHualalai, on the western side of the Big Island of Hawaii is the third youngest and third-most active volcano on the island. The 1700's were years of significant volcanic activity with six different vents erupting lava, two of which produced lava flows that reached the sea. The Kona International Airport is built atop the larger of these two flows. \nDespite much building of businesses, homes and roads on the slopes and flows of Hualalai, it is anticipated that the volcano will again erupt within the next 100 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T17:26:31.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
