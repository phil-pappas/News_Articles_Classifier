Rainville brought in his family and fellow boy scouts to help fix up the building.\n\"We're cleaning brush and repainting this out building which is used by members of the Jewish faith to hold vigil over the dead for 24 hours before they're buried,\" Rainville said.\nThe building and connected synagogue date back to 1885 and are still in use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T22:20:08.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
