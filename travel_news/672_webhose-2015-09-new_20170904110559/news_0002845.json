With plenty of exciting cities and towns available, as well as mouth-watering cuisine wherever you go, it is completely understandable that you might be having a hard time choosing. \nThanks to the InterRail system, however, you don’t really have to choose. All you need is an itinerary, a great group of friends, and an EU medical card (just in case). \nWhat Exactly Is the InterRail? \nThe InterRail Pass, now called the InterRail Global Pass, allows unlimited rail travel within and between every country that participates in the scheme for a set period of time. Although there are some exceptions to keep in mind - such as the pass not including travel within your country of residence as well as travel in high-speed and night trains - it is a fantastic and very affordable way of exploring the continent. \nCan I Go InterRailing On a Budget? \nEspecially in the summer, when air travel can get extortionately expensive and coach rides are long and uncomfortable, the InterRail Pass is a great compromise with regards to speed and price. Nevertheless, you do need to be economical about certain things during your travels. The very first thing to remember is to apply for your EU medical card, which is free and will cover most health-related mishaps in European Union countries. If you're buying souvenirs, try to find them outside hotspot tourist destinations, such as main squares or sightseeing attractions. Finding shops that are not specifically dedicated to selling knick-knacks with the place name written on them, but are rather gift shops locals would frequent, is a sure way of saving some money and impressing someone special with more thoughtful gifts. \nWhere Should I Go? \nAnywhere you are interested in, really! The main tourist destinations tend to be large cities, such as Barcelona, Paris, Amsterdam, and Rome, but you don’t have to restrict your travels to big cities at all. Many people find that they grow tired, and even bored, of the larger destinations with their huge crowds, and decide to escape to the countryside or smaller towns in order to relax and do things other than sightseeing. \nIs There Anything I Should Be Splurging On? \nWhen it comes to accommodation, food, and drink, it is wise to invest a little extra. Sleeping in train stations at night, for example, is unsafe and, in some countries, illegal. Shelter and nutrition are the most important things to consider when planning your trip. Whether you prefer to share a room with friendly fellow travellers in a hostel or the tranquility of an individual hotel room is up to you: just make sure you have booked in advance to avoid an unexpected lack of vacancies due to a local event you hadn’t realised was taking place. \nYou should also remember that the aforementioned EU medical card is not equivalent to travel insurance, so you might want to do some research into what type of insurance suits your InterRail travels best beforehand. However, if you decide against travel insurance (not recommended), do make sure to check that the EU medical card will be valid everywhere you go. \nAny Last Words of Wisdom? \nIf you ask InterRail veterans for advice, the first thing they will say is this: travel light. Remember that you will be carrying that big, heavy backpack with you throughout your trip, probably in relentless heat and crowded streets. Lay out what you think you will need on the floor, and then halve it. \nBeing selective of who you travel with, learning some basic words in the local language, and bringing comfortable clothing are other things to keep in mind. Continental Europe is an unmissable travel destination, and InterRailing is an extraordinary way to make the most of it.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nP.K.
