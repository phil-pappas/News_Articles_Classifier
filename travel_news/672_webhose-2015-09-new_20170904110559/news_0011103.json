It covers transportation on trains, the RER, and the metro in the Paris area chosen by the recipient. The highest priced weekly Navigo (currently €37,20) includes transportation within Paris and suburbs, airports Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and Orly (ORY), Chateau Versailles , Fontainebleau, Parc Disney. \nThere are currently two versions of the Navigo pass, the standard Navigo and the Navigo Découverte. The Navigo pass is reserved for the locals, but anyone can purchase a Navigo Découverte--although, as with the Carte Orange, sellers of the popular transportation pass may try to discourage foreign tourists from purchasing a Navigo Découverte. Price of a Navigo Découverte transportation Pass \nFor a Navigo one week pass you'll pay €5 fee for card itself, then you'll need to add the cost of the transportation coverage you need. Currently (2009) the prices are: €19,80 for Paris only (Zone 1+2) €34.40 for Paris out to Airports CDG/ORY (up to Zone 6) \nYou will need a picture of yourself for the pass, 3cm high by 2.5cm wide, which is smaller than passport sized. You can purchase them in photo kiosks near the ticket windows that sell passes on the Metro, RER and Ile-de-France trains. Duration of the Passe Navigo Découverte \nThe pass starts on Monday morning with the first cars, and ends on Sunday. Like the Carte Orange , this may impact tourists not arriving in Paris on Monday. How to Purchase a Navigo Découverte \nYou can purchase a Navigo from ticket windows from a metro or RER station or authorized resellers (like some local tabacs). There are machines at stations as well, but they won't accept credit cards in non-Euro denominations, some travelers complain. \nThere is an excellent page explaining how a foreigner purchased a Navigo pass here . Hassled When Buying a pass? \nDespite what a ticket seller might tell you, you do have the right to purchase and use a Passe Navigo Découverte. Alternatives to the Navigo Découverte - Paris Visite \nIf you want to avoid the hassle and purchase a Paris transportation from the US, you can get the more expensive Paris Visite Pass, which is specially designed for tourists and also offers discounts on museums and tours. The Paris Visite Pass (Buy Direct) is available online. \nThis option also works out if you are planning on visiting Paris later in the week, when the Navigo offers a lower value. The Paris Visite is available in 1,2,3, and 5 day versions for Zones 1 to 6, just like the most expensive Navigo pass. The Paris Visite also offers museum and tour discounts (check the link above to see if the Paris Visite meets your needs).
