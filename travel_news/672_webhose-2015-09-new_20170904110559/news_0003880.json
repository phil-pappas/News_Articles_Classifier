I tend to people watch (polite euphemism for crudely gawk at locals) in a restaurant with an ardent following, a new cultural institution, or a must-see market. Not this time.\nBecause this story is about Detroit, I can’t start writing about the new places without diving into the old, and the extraordinary circumstances that have created a city unlike any I’ve seen. A population plunge from 1.8 million residents in the 1950s to fewer than 700,000 in 2013 has left approximately 30,000 empty acres. There is so much land that one developer is in the process of creating a 150-acre tree farm in the city.\nContinue reading below\nOnce you drive out of commercial areas, you see former grassy lawns that have joined to become fields. It’s a preternaturally quiet landscape dotted with a house here and there, or an occasional necklace of homes. There are packs of wild dogs in some areas. Tens of thousands of houses have been torn down. A record 150 homes were razed in July alone.\nThis creates an effect known as urban prairie. It’s eerie to drive through empty swaths of a city dismantled by a sour economy over several decades while crime spiked.\nThere are problems in Detroit, and I’m not going to drizzle them with honey and then sprinkle rose petals over the situation to pretty it up. However the clouds are slowly parting. The city has come through bankruptcy, survived a none-too-positive trend called “ruin porn,” and its unemployment rate has started to drop (although at 13 percent, it’s still more than double the rest of Michigan). Many neighborhoods now have street lights for the first time in years.\nContinue reading it below\nHow to appreciate Detroit’s masculine appeal The Spirit of Detroit is masculine and many would agree Detroit is a guy’s kind of town, filled with music and automobile history.\nFor the moment, let’s set aside Detroit’s 200,000 empty lots and the tens of thousands of torn-down homes, and finally launch into this like a proper travel story. Cue the narration: It’s a Friday night and I’m playing one of my favorite childhood pastimes, skeeball, in a place called Dangerously Delicious Pies . As effete “Saturday Night Live” character Stefon would say, “ This place has everything .” It’s a rock ’n’ roll pie shop located in the back of the bar in the Midtown neighborhood. This means I was eating pie at 1 a.m. and washing it down with a rum and Coke. Maybe not the best combo, but I was having too much fun to notice the sugar overload and it seemed to be helping my skeeball game.\nThis was after I had dinner at a new restaurant called Chartreuse Kitchen & Cocktails , also in the Midtown. I was only planning to grab something quick at Chartreuse, but was intrigued by the menu, which included a dish called Recovery Park. The vegetable plate takes its name from a farm just a few blocks away. There are other dishes on the menu that come from local farmers as well.\nIt’s logical that farm-to-table dining would blossom here. Urban farming is a growing enterprise in Detroit and seen as a possible solution to both filling empty land and providing much-needed inner-city employment. Gary Wozniak, executive manager of Recovery Park , said he has a long-term plan for his organization to oversee 100 acres of that land. Plans call for 20 acres of greenhouses, plus fisheries, factories for processing all of that food, and agritourism. Currently Recovery Park is farming on one acre.\n“I see Detroit as a foodie hotspot,” Wozniak said.\nI never would have used the words “Detroit” and “foodie hotspot” in the same sentence until the night I tried to get a table at the city’s restaurant-of-the-moment, Selden Standard . I had no luck scoring a reservation for a Saturday night. I tried the walk-in route. At 9 p.m. there was more than a two-hour wait. The restaurant’s last seating was at 10 p.m.\nBeth Hagenbuc for The Boston Globe\nLafayette Greens garden in downtown Detroit.\nSelden Standard opened less than a year ago in a not-so-desirable part of town, it’s now generally regarded as the top restaurant in Detroit. Like Chartreuse, it also uses produce from local urban farmers.\n“A lot of people thought we were crazy for moving to this building,” said Andy Hollyday, partner and executive chef of the restaurant. His business partner, Evan Hansen, said every day he hears of new people coming to town to start farms, or acquiring vacant lots with the intention of farming.\nNew residents are doing more than starting farms. The foodie culture extends to the 77 new restaurants that opened in Detroit last year. There’s also Eastern Market , a behemoth farmers’ market that is the city’s epicenter of activity every weekend during the summer. I looked at lots of healthy produce while eating beignets from a food truck. Beignets are healthy if you get them at a farmers’ market, right?\nThe restaurant boom and urban farming is feeding the growth of some arty new neighborhoods. There are the parts of Detroit where vacancy rates are dropping and young, artistic types with tattoos, vintage skirts, and man buns are setting up their turntables.\nThe arrival of these hipster pioneers has led some to declare that Detroit will be the next Brooklyn. There may be a rock ’n’ roll pie shop, a lot of cool galleries, and a local distillery with a fun bar, but I didn’t see the word “artisanal” often enough for this to be Brooklyn redux, and the people were far too polite for this city to resemble anything close to New York. Let’s hope it stays that way.\nAlex Gonzalez for The Boston Globe\nThe Detroit Institute of Arts.\n“The similarity may be that it’s a creative community,” says illustrator Meredith Miotke , who has lived in both Detroit and Brooklyn, “One of the things that makes Detroit special is that it’s not as overwhelming. You can really connect with people.”\nDetroit’s cool neighborhoods, proudly pointed out to me by the concierge at my hotel, are Corktown and Midtown . There’s also Greektown, Downtown, and the thriving Mexicantown. I quickly learned that the word “neighborhood” has a different meaning in Detroit. Here, it’s usually just a block or two of bars, bike shops, restaurants, and independent stores. In less gentrified areas, the mix includes a Coney Island hot dog restaurant or two (Coney Island is Detroit speak for hot dogs). These vibrant little strips are surrounded by derelict lots and empty buildings. No two neighborhoods are within walking distance, which makes a car necessary. There is a monorail (for 75 cents!) that loops around Detroit’s business district. A street car system is coming, but not for at least two years.\nIt was important for me to see the changes taking place, but as someone who knows the words (and most of the choreography) to pretty much every Four Tops song , I needed to see the city’s cultural institutions, such as the Motown Museum . Detroit was also the birthplace of techno, although there’s no museum celebrating that form of electronic music yet. There’s also a must-see fine arts museum : the Detroit Institute of Arts.\nDetroit’s slow rebound from the rubble\nDespite all of that, I have to confess this trip was inspired by the city’s decay . I’ve seen the pictures and read the books about the grand, beautiful theaters, schools, and office buildings that were abandoned. I wanted to see “ruin porn” first hand. As the auto plants closed and businesses and residents left for the suburbs, beautiful architecture was deserted.\nThese places now look like the remnants of some dystopian world. They’re horribly sad, but there is also an odd beauty in seeing these spaces fall back to nature . As morbid as it sounds, there are tours where guides will take you into these buildings. It’s called urban exploring.\nI booked a tour with Jesse Welter , who told me he began taking people around to the abandoned buildings for photography classes, but there was so much demand that he now also runs sightseeing tours.\nIt’s tough to scrape together the words to explain the emotions these places trigger. In a deserted grand high school, a lonely basketball sits on the floor of a gymnasium surrounded by shattered glass and debris. Someone spray painted “Just Drop Out!” on the wall of a classroom. Down the hall, final exam questions are still displayed on a blackboard. Paint is curling and cracking in every room.\nIn another barren neighborhood, a crumbled theater, battered by fire and stripped of its metals by thieves, is now fully exposed to the elements. A man on my tour who grew up in a nearby city told me he remembered when the theater was a concert hall. He surveyed the rubble in disbelief.\nIt sounds dramatic, but I started tearing up in an abandoned, graffiti-covered church. While other tourists smiled and took selfies, I stood thinking about the families that once came here, all those weddings and christenings replaced with spray paint and dirt.\nI may have come here because of my fascination with ruins and urban exploring, but what stuck in my brain were places such as Gold Cash Gold , a former pawn shop turned into a cool restaurant; a charming home store called Nest ; the amazing bikes at Detroit’s own Shinola ; and the gobs of people enjoying the breeze on the RiverWalk . I wish I had psychic abilities to see whether this city will live up to its promise as a urban gardening utopia or become the Brooklyn of the Midwest.
