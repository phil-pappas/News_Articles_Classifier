It divides the city into two sections, Bur Dubai and Deira. Both the sides of the Dubai Creek house some of the best monuments and exquisite buildings of the city. Hence, you must definitely make a trip to the Creek. However, rather than walking on the coast, go on a dhow cruise to turn your sightseeing into a unique experience.The dhow is a traditional Bedouin boat that was used for trade and transportation. Today, these dhows have been converted into restaurants that have a lower (air-conditioned) and upper (open-air) decks. You are offered a welcome drink on arrival and are also served delicious barbecued dishes once the dhow sets on sail.While you enjoy your drink and starters, you can take a look at the prestigious buildings and structures of Dubai, glittering in the night lights.
