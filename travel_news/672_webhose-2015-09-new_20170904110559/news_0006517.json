Save the world instead. \nA) IGNORING THE \"SIX MONTH RULE\" \nI was on the board of a business where we all got the financials for that month and realized that the company had six months of cash in the bank. \nI called the CEO. He said, \"no problem. We have six months. I'll raise money a long time before then and we have some big potential customer deals.\" \nNo you don't. \nYou are already out of business if you just have six months cash left. \nRaising money takes AT LEAST six months from beginning to end. And that's if you have a great company. \nThere's meeting VCs, pitching, due diligence, legal, and then the final funding, which by itself is around a month. \nAnd new customers take 2 months to find, 2 months to do the work, and 3 months to pay. Best case. \nWe ended up going into emergency mode. Stopping all development. Hired a bank to sell the company. And the company sold when it had about 3 hours worth of cash left. The CEO left with millions but was three hours from going broke and almost didn't know it. \nQUESTION: Does the 6 months rule apply to artists? \nYES! \nYesterday someone said to me: I'm going to quit my job and write. I know I will get published if I can just focus on the writing. \nThis person will lose. \nNobody is waiting for your magnum opus. And you need money in the bank. And work is often fuel for stories. \nOr it gets you motivated. As in: \"Ugh, I hate this job so much I better write as good as possible.\" \nDon't be a baby. Get six months cash in the bank. That's the first taste of freedom. Don't go below that. \nB) ENTREPRENEURS SMOKE TOO MUCH CRACK \nWe have a cognitive bias to think that our shit doesn't stink. \nOne time I was starting a business and I realized about halfway through development of the product that I had 5 competitors. \nI started to cry. My business partner couldn't cheer me up. My ex-wife couldn't cheer me up. My early-morning Scrabble friends couldn't cheer me up. \nMy developers in Bangalore cheered me up. \"Don't worry. We'll just make yours better.\" \nBut every day I had to ask, \"am I really making it better? Is this really a feature I would use? Is this feature better than the features on all the other sites?\" \nWe went into feature overload but it was worth it. We sold the business a few months before the market peaked. All of our competitors went out of business. \nYou have to ask every day, \"Am I smoking crack?\" Because otherwise your bias is to say, \"I have the best business in the world. We can never go out of business.\" \nQUESTION: Do artists smoke crack? \nOf course. We're all crack smokers all the time. \nScott Adams, of Dilbert fame, told me when he was a loan office that his boss told him,\"Never lend money to anyone who says they love what they do.\" \nThe reason: because passion is crack. It blinds you to the faults of your art, your product, your business, your friends, etc. \nIt's really hard. Even now I smoke crack. I look at opportunities every day and they all sound so exciting. Crack crack crack. Mmmm! \nRun it by someone who doesn't care about what you do. They can say, \"you're smoking crack\" or at least ask the right questions. \nC) PARTNERS VEST \nYour business partner is your worst enemy. \nHe's worse than your competitors because you are more likely to fail because of a partner than a competitor. \nJust like marriage. \nIn my first business, I gave a partner 10% of the business. Then a day later he quit to write a TV show for MTV. I don't blame him. Heck, I wanted to work for him. \nBut it was not fun. We had to borrow money to buy him out. It put stress on everyone and I was blamed for inviting him into the company in the first place. \nI just had an investment get sold at a low price. The main problem: the partners disagreed. \nThis happens in every business. It's hard enough for two people who love each other to stay married. It's even harder for two people who don't love each other to work all day together and try to make millions. \nTwo solutions: Everyone should have clear roles. No \"co-CEOs\". You do this and I do that. Period. Partners who don't put money in should vest their shares - meaning they get a little bit of their shares over time. Usually four years. If they quit, they only have a small piece of their shares. Or maybe none of their shares. \nD) BAD ENTREPRENEURS HIRE PEOPLE \nSometimes you need to hire people. \nBut triple-question this. \nOnce you hire them, you can't fire them. \nAre you sure you aren't hiring them for a task you can do yourself. For instance, you don't need a secretary to book your plane flights and make restaurant reservations. Do it yourself. \nOr sales. The founder should be the sales guy for the first $10 million in revenues. \nDon't hire 5 programmers. Studies show the difference between a good programmer and a bad one is about 10:1. \nSo hire one great one and pay double what you would pay individually to 5 mediocre programmers. \nThe success of a business, the success of a relationship, the success of an artistic scene, is going to be determined by the people you surround yourself with. \nIf someone is not A+, then they are an F. They might later be an A+. But don't hire at all if your only choices are Fs. \nAnd don't hire if you don't have six months cash in the bank to support the hire. \nE) BAD ENTREPRENEURS WORRY ABOUT USELESS STUFF \nShould you be a C-Corp or an S-Corp? \nWho cares. \nShould you have a logo and a mission statement? \nWho cares. \nI don't think I incorporated my second successful business until the day before we were sold. And I don't know if we ever had a logo or business cards. I forget. \nThe only things to worry about: is the product helping people? And do I have more than six months cash in the bank? \nAnd constantly asking yourself if you are smoking crack on the two questions above. \nWhat can go wrong, for instance, that can bring you under six months cash in the bank? Who would you fire then? \nThese are things worth worrying about. \nBecause it will force you to keep good relationships with customers to keep the money flowing. And it will force you to constantly know your numbers and test every feature before you spend money on it. \nF) BAD ENTREPRENEURS TAKE RISKS \nThere's a myth that entrepreneurs are risk takers. This is MBA Crack. \nThat's why 85% of entrepreneurs fail. They believed that myth. They were told all of their lives they were \"bulldogs\" and can survive anything. \nWell, making people happy is really hard. Cooking a meal better than the restaurant down the street is really hard. Building a website that people go to more than they go to twitter is really hard. \nA friend of mine had a great idea for a business. Protein water. Clear water that had 10 grams of protein in it. High quality protein. Good to drink after workouts. Etc. \nWhole Foods started selling it. Things were looking good. \nBut he never tested if people would actually buy it. \nPut an ad up on Facebook. \"Clear protein water. 10 grams 0 calories.\" If they click, send them to a page describing the benefits and putting them on an email list. \nIf a lot of people click - you might have a good business. Develop the product. \nIf nobody clicks. Move on. \nMy friend went out of business. \nGoing out of business is not a \"learning experience\". It's really painful. You feel like dying. \nIt's the ugliest thing in the world next to the item I'm about to describe. \nG) BAD ENTREPRENEURS HAVE SEX WITH EMPLOYEES \nBelieve it or not, I see this all the time. \nA CEO gets, literally, cocky, and starts fooling around with employees. This is death to the business. \nI wish I could've gotten back my money the second I found out each time a CEO was cheating on his wife (or her husband). \nNot that they are so untrustworthy. That's not the reason. I don't judge and I don't know what goes on in people's lives. \nBut it just means that they are going to go through a world of personal shit that I don't want to have to deal with as an investor. It will take their focus off the business. \nSave it for after you cash out. You can lose all your money then but I get to keep mine. \nH) THEY FORGET THEIR LOYALTIES \nBeing an entrepreneur largely sucks. \nWhen you're an employee, you do what your boss says and you help your colleagues and you leave your work in the office at the end of the day. \nWhen you're an entrepreneur you have to: Constantly keep the customers happy. This means responding to emails and comments at 3 in the morning every day. \nKeep employees motivated and creative. This doesn't mean pep talks. This means, find them work they find meaningful and understanding the particular work-life balance for each employee so they can stay both disciplined and happy. Keep shareholders happy. Since they write the emergency checks when you go below your six months. \nAll of the above are your bosses 24 hours a day. Meanwhile, you're CEO, Head of Sales, Head of Marketing, and project manager for all projects until you are fully off the ground. \nWhat does \"off the ground\" mean? It doesn't mean have six months cash in the bank. That's just treading water. \nIt means you have two years of cash in the bank with stable customers. \nBy the way, does this question apply to artists and writers? \nOf course. I write. \"Customers\" are readers. And I have to work with marketers, designers, researchers, Amazon, other writers, podcasters, speaking channels, mentors, and alternative marketing channels. \nThis means constant communication. I write in the morning. And then do \"business\" in the afternoon. \nMake a list of all the groups you need to be loyal to. This loyalty is not \"here today, gone tomorrow\". These are the groups of people who will catapult you to success. These are the people you will catapult to success. \nYou need to touch these people in some way each day. \nAnd this is not about 2015. This is how life works for 10,000 years. \nI) BAD ENTREPRENEURS PICK FIGHTS \nI always ask people about their competitors. You know what the worst answer is? \"They suck.\" \nYou know what the best answer is? \"Oh yeah, I just had breakfast with the CEO of my biggest competitor.\" \nYou and I, we are here for a long time. We're all going to grow up in business together. \nSometimes your employees become your competitors. Then they might become your bosses. \nThey might buy your company after their company is bought. And then they might be your employees again. \nWe learn and get ideas from each other. \nPixar would learn from Disney how to tell a story. Disney would learn from Pixar how to use technology. Until they merged and Disney's stock doubled. \nPayPal (Peter Thiel) and X.com (Elon Musk) would constantly try to one-up each. Until they merged. Then their biggest competitor (Ebay) bought them. \nNow the \"paypal mafia\" dominates Silicon Valley (see graphic). \nFrancis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese pushed each other all through the 70s and 80s. When one did the Godfather, the other would do Taxi Driver. When one did The Cotton Club, the other did the Colour of Money. \nDid they hate each other? Of course not. Scorsese even wrote the music for Coppola's film \"The Outsiders\" and they teamed up on \"New York Stories\" (with Woody Allen). \nYour competitors are your scene. You will know each other for 50 years. Respect! \nThe entrepreneurs that I see burn out and disappear are the ones who never built community and friendship around them with their peers. \nJ) I have a \"J\" and I wrote about it Monday. It's Over Promise and Over Deliver.
