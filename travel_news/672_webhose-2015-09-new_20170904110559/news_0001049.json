The Cairn Group has purchased the 114 bedroom property and plans to invest £8m on a refurbishment over the next 12 months. Speaking of the acquisition Tina O'Hara Group Sales Director said: “The Ramada at Glasgow Airport realises presence in a strategic location and complements our other five properties in Scotland. \n“We have been looking to acquire in Glasgow for some time, and this opportunity fits perfectly into our ambitious expansion plans.” “The hotel will have synergy with our Newcastle International Airport hotel DoubleTree by Hilton.” Despite a full re-design and re-work at the hotel it will be business as usual and all jobs are both safe and secured by the new owners. Richard Adams Group HR Director said: \"It's fantastic to welcome the team at Ramada Glasgow to our business and we’re looking forward to involving them in people activities across the group. “This acquisition has increased the number of employees to 2,100 across our portfolio, and the development of the hotel should increase headcount at the property by some 20%, in line with our previous projects. We will also engage with local suppliers across all aspects of the business. We are proud to be safeguarding and creating jobs in Glasgow. “ The Cairn Group, launched in 1980, is based in Newcastle Upon Tyne and operates 24 hotels in locations from Aberdeen to London. The group successfully operate 12 individually branded bars and restaurants in Edinburgh, London and Newcastle. The Cairn Group has enjoyed dynamic growth by acquisition and operate under several brand banners including DoubleTree by Hilton, Crowne Plaza, Best Western, and Holiday Inn.
