From today, there will be no minimum threshold required before members of Le Club AccorHotels can transfer their Points to Qantas Points at a rate of 1:1, when an on-going automatic conversion is set-up via qantaspoints.com.\nThe Qantas Frequent Flyer and AccorHotels partnership is now global spanning some 2,800 hotels across 92 countries including over 650 hotels across Asia Pacific, enabling Le Club AccorHotels members to do more with their points and be rewarded faster with Qantas.\nQantas Loyalty CEO Lesley Grant said the changes simplify the process for converting Le Club AccorHotels Points to Qantas Points and give members of both programs greater options.\n“Members can login to their Le Club AccorHotels account and choose to automatically sweep across their points into their Qantas Frequent Flyer account after each stay,” said Ms Grant.\n“This means members will only have to set their preferences once and the points conversion will automatically happen in the background. This is a great option for Qantas Frequent Flyer members who lead really busy lives and who want to set their preference and then forget about it.”\n“But equally, if members want to have a little more control they can still periodically log into their Le Club AccorHotels account and manually move points across to their Frequent Flyer account when it’s convenient to them,” Ms Grant added.\nAccorHotels Chief Operating Officer Pacific, Simon McGrath, said the expanded partnership will give Le Club AccorHotels members even greater access to Qantas Frequent Flyer.\n“AccorHotels has an incredibly long history with Qantas and manages many of the airline’s award-winning airport lounges, which is why it is so fitting for our two organisations to enhance the offering for our most loyal members,” said Mr McGrath.\n“We are thrilled to strengthen our global partnership with Qantas Frequent Flyer to provide greater rewards and benefits for more than 22 million Le Club AccorHotels guests so they can travel further and discover more of the world with Qantas. The strengthened points arrangement will provide the simplest and best value option for travellers seeking to convert their earned hotel points into flight rewards.”\nMs Grant said staying at partner hotel groups is an easy way for members to boost their Qantas Points balance.\nLe Club AccorHotels has around 22 million members globally, while 10.8 million people are part of Qantas Frequent Flyer.\nBackground:\nTwo conversion options from 18 September 2015:\n1. Members manually and periodically choose when to convert Le Club AccorHotels Points to Qantas Points (for each conversion, a minimum of 2000 Le Club AccorHotels Points are required).\n2. Members set up an automatic conversion which will see Le Club AccorHotels Points convert to Qantas Points (no minimum threshold). This requires the member to login to their Le Club AccorHotels account via qantaspoints.com to set this preference. If logging in and setting this preference directly via the AccorHotels website, the minimum 2000 point conversion threshold will apply.\nSource: Qantas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:07:12.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
