Other travelers insist on a comfy, cozy, intimate experience, which is why they choose nostalgic inns and small hotels like the SunBreeze Hotel on Ambergris Caye Belize . Frequent visitors to this 43-room hotel keep coming back to the welcoming embrace of a place that feels like home, so if this sounds like exactly your kind of destination, you can stop looking and start packing! \nWhat to expect \nSunBreeze is a small, friendly, cozy hotel with big ambitions: offering the sort of hospitality that can’t be found in huge, impersonal lodgings where owners are more interested in making a profit by charging for every little extra than showering guests with attention. You might expect to pay a lot for such personal service, but in fact, rates are affordable and you’ll love staying close to San Pedro Town activities, shops and attractions. \nStaff aims to please \nAt SunBreeze, staff is eager to get your day off to the right start, so they brew complimentary tea and coffee from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. daily. If you need help scheduling your day, consult with the receptionist or concierge for recommendations. If you fly into the adjacent San Pedro Airstrip, a SunBreeze porter will even carry your luggage the short distance to the hotel so you don’t have to! \nAccommodations \nSince the SunBreeze has just 43 rooms , you might worry about bare-bones environs, but you can rid your mind of that thought! Even Standard rooms are well appointed, starting with lush tropical garden or pool views, comfortable beds, mini-‘fridges, flat screen TVs, Wi-Fi connections, vanity or work areas and spacious baths. Deluxe rooms are of a more modern decore with partial ocean views. For the ultimate stay, book a Premier room with a Jacuzzi tub and see how it feels to vacation like royalty on a modest budget. \nActivities \nSince the SunBreeze serves as a dive center —the hotel is literally situated at the water’s edge—excursions and tours to myriad locations are just a booking away. Fish, swim, snorkel and dive the days away during your stay, or explore land-based attractions that run the gamut from meeting Belize Zoo residents and engaging in zip lining thrills to touring multi-cultural spots and Mayan ruins. \nOn-premises dining \nThe Blue Water Grill offers atmosphere and delicious dining from 7 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. daily. Menu selections are eclectic; “Island cuisine with a twist.” So whether you eat nothing but meat, can’t get enough seafood, insist on pizza or sushi, the Grill, repeatedly rated one of the best eateries in town, satisfies all palates. Because this is a popular restaurant, reservations are recommended, but while you wait for your table, make new friends at the 360 Degree Bar, a lively gathering place that’s home to some of the tastiest and most exotic cocktails you’ll find in Belize . \nExtras \nStaying at the SunBreeze is a great way to save the money and there’s literally every convenience you can name within reach. Major credit cards are accepted, as is U.S. currency (the exchange rate is $2 Belize per $1 U.S.), enjoy free pool towels throughout your stay, graceful lounge chairs on the sun deck and if you want to get around solo, the concierge can arrange for everything from golf carts and bicycles to cars. Babysitters are available with 24 hours’ notice and just in case you worry about power outages in the tropics, a generator servicing the entire hotel is always on standby!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T07:45:08.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
