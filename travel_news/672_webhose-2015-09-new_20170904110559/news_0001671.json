According to Sergiu George, UK General Manager, HomeToGo, “this abundance of choice is particularly useful when digging deeper into advanced search”.\nConsidering that all physical addresses of available holiday homes are placed on a map, it’s possible to filter a search by distance to water if, for example, you’re looking for a place near the beach. On the other hand, if you’re staying in a city, the map allows you to chose a location that is, for instance, near a recommended park.\nFurther filtering of holiday homes is based on amenities such as Wifi, parking or wheelchair access.\nDetection of multiple listings HomeToGo’s search algorithm also detects the holiday homes that are listed on several websites, giving the price listed on each one of them, within one search result.\nGeorge claims thatone of the things that sets HomeToGo apart from the competition, is that it doesn’t duplicate listings. “If a property is listed on ten vacation rental websites and five of them are our partners, we'd only list the property once, but will show the prices from each partner,” he says.\nIt then goes a step further by ranking results based on reviews, the number of bookings a property has had and cancellation rates to name a few. As such, says George, the search results pages are constantly optimised to show the best options first.\nAlthough price is one unique selling point, the firm is also focused closely on the convenience and quality of properties.\nHarnessing big data to bring more transparency and better decision-making to holiday rentals Although HomeToGo cites “a fairly intuitive user interface” as an “already significant achievement”, the firm is now moving towards making the world’s vacation rentals market fully transparent.\nThe next step is evaluating the big data, which is managers entirely in-house, from the changes in search results to track the price variation of vacation rentals throughout seasons.\nIn time, it is hoped that this will make the holiday rentals market more transparent to the general public. “The aim here is to allow a higher booking rate for landlords, while also highlighting offers for price sensitive buyers,” says George.\nThe recently published HomeToGo 2015 Summer Study report does just that.\nIt shows the price difference between the high season in July and August and the low season in September 2015, pointing out the destination cities and resorts in Europe that offer the highest savings in September.\nIn one example, this infographic highlights the high and low season variations of 25 countries for a one-week stay with four guests.\nData: 2015, HomeToGo.co.uk\nHomeToGo’s aim is to find new ways to present the data so that every user understands it and can make better decisions as a result.\nTaking partner needs seriously In terms of marketing efforts, the group’s customers come mainly through SEM and SEO channels. HomeToGo then generates revenue from the traffic or potential bookings made on partners’ websites, working mainly on a cost-per-click basis.\n“A key point in business model is the quality of the traffic going to our partners,” says George.\nUnlike the traffic coming from SEM or affiliate sources, traffic going to partners from HomeToGo is from users that expressed interest in one particular property from one of the partner websites the property is listed on.\n“We also enforce our partner's brand throughout the entire process,” he concludes.", "external_links": ["https://www.hometogo.co.uk/insights/summer-study-2015/", "https://www.hometogo.co.uk/assets/2015/09/infographic-UK-1-1200px.png", "http://eyefortraveldrupalfs.s3.amazonaws.com/home_to_go_search_to_insert_in_story.png"], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:03:47.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
