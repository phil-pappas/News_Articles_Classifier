As I will be travelling with my aged parents and kids, I need hotels with proper service like in house restaurant , room service, hot water etc. Can opt for a good homestay as well if that is not very secluded and there are restaurants around for dining. My travel dates are from 4th Nov to 9th Nov this year and some of the hotels like Heritage Hotel Tripura Castle, Pinewood , Polo Towers etc are already sold out forcing me to seek help from your guys. Also looking for a Cab operator in Shillong ( preferable a big car that can house all 6 of us .... Innova/Tavera/Scorpio/Ertiga kind of ... not Sumo ) who can provide us service for all the 5 days we are going to stay in Shillong .... that might include a pick up and drop to Guwahati Airport. The only condition I would like to put here is a descent driver with good behaviour ) .
