In Costa Rica, this species can be identified by its long, pointed tail and a variable amount of red on the forehead.\n(Courtesy of Jorge Solís Campos)\nCrimson-fronted Parakeet ( Psittacara finschi )\nSpanish & Costa Rican local names: Perico Frentirrojo, Cotorra, Chucuyo, Perico Colilarga, Perico de Palmera*\nA few parrot species can be found in San José, but the Crimson-fronted Parakeet is by far the most common. These birds are an energetic bunch, flocking in groups to building eaves and trees with an incessant chatter that can be deafening if you find yourself next to a tree full of them. Here’s the sound of a flock flying overhead (some taxonomic authorities refer to this species as Finsch’s Parakeet/ Aratinga finschi ):\nAlthough this species is abundant in San José, it’s actually quite special in that it’s a regional endemic: its entire range extends only from Nicaragua to western Panama. It belongs to the Psittacidae family, along with parrots and macaws.\nThe Rufous-collared Sparrow can be distinguished from similar birds by its gray-and-black crested head.\n(Via Rodolfo Walker/Flickr)\nRufous-collared Sparrow ( Zonotrichia capensis )\nSpanish & Costa Rican local names: Chingolo, Comemaíz, Pirrís\nYou can’t walk very far down a sidewalk in San José without running into a pair of Rufous-collared Sparrows hopping around on the ground or flitting between bushes. Like most members of its family, this species has a conical bill ideal for cracking seeds and grains, hence its local name Comemaíz. It belongs to the Emberizidae family, along with finches, buntings, and other New World sparrows. Its vocalizations include a whistled song:\nThe Tropical Kingbird can be distinguished from similar birds in Costa Rica by its notched tail.\n(Via James Diedrick/Flickr)\nTropical Kingbird ( Tyrannus melancholicus )\nSpanish & Costa Rican local names: Tirano Tropical, Pecho Amarillo\nLike the Great Kiskadee we described last month, the Tropical Kingbird belongs to Tyrannidae, the tyrant flycatcher family, and is one of about a dozen birds known as pecho amarillo in Costa Rica. Flycatchers are known for, well, fly catching. Like many of its relatives, the Tropical Kingbird frequently hunts flying insects by making quick flights known as “sallies” and returning to the same perch, as this bird is doing:\nThe Rufous-tailed Hummingbird is distinguished from other Costa Rica hummers by its combination of a rufous (reddish-brown) tail and green breast.\n(Courtesy of Raul A. Vega Vega)\nRufous-tailed Hummingbird ( Amazilia tzacatl )\nSpanish & Costa Rican local names: Amazilia Rabirrufa, Gorrión\nCosta Rica is home to about 50 of the roughly 340 known hummingbird species, and this one is the most common in the gardens and open areas of the Central Valley. The Rufous-tailed Hummingbird is highly aggressive and territorial at bunches of flowers, readily chasing off other hummers. They have a variety of vocalizations, including this song:\nHummingbirds make up the Trochilidae family, and occur only in the Americas. As one might expect from the size of their feet, they can’t really walk, but can shuffle sideways along a perch.\nThe White-winged Dove can be told apart from similar doves and pigeons by its white wing stripe, which is usually visible on the folded wing.\n(Via Laura Gooch/Flickr)\nWhite-winged Dove ( Zenaida asiatica )\nSpanish & Costa Rican local names: Paloma Aliblanca, Arrocera\nThis species is about the same size as the common city pigeon (Rock Pigeon) and much larger than the Inca Dove . Like many other doves and pigeons – which collectively make up the Columbidae family – the White-winged Dove forages for seeds, grain and grit largely by walking (not hopping) on the ground, its head bobbing. Its throaty call is often transliterated as ‘who-cooks-for-you':\n* All Spanish and local species names are taken from the Asociación Ornitológica de Costa Rica .\nCheck out other “Into the Wild” columns here.\nRobin Kazmier is general manager of The Tico Times Publications Group, editor of various field guides and natural history books, and author of the forthcoming National Parks of Costa Rica (with photographer Greg Basco).
