The largest increase was seen in Scandinavian visitors, who accounted for 60 percent more overnight guest nights compared to the same month of 2014. In Stockholm County, a total of 1.6 million overnight stays in commercial accommodation facilities were registered in July, which is an increase of 20 percent.\nWe saw that of the number of overnight guest stays in Stockholm in July, 60 percent were from domestic visitors, according to data from Statistics Sweden/ Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Growth Board). This is an increase of 21 percent, while foreign overnight stays grew by 18 percent in July. Similar to the previous month, most of the foreign visitors came from Germany.\n“We see that Stockholm’s appeal and attractiveness increases, as evidenced by the visitor statistics. A substantial part of the increase in July represents a proof that our region has become a truly competitive alternative for large meetings and conventions, due to among other things the fine facilities that are available here,” observes Thomas Andersson, CEO of Stockholm Visitors Board.\nAmong the Nordic countries, the largest increase of visitors was primarily from Denmark, followed by Norway. One reason for the sharp increase in Scandinavian visitors in July was a major international conference which was held in Stockholm. Russia accounted for a large decrease in visitors; 33 percent fewer visitors in July compared with the same month in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:23:19.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
