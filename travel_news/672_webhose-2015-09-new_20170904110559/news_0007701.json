The tightly wound indigo turban was drawn closely across the face of the tall Tuareg warrior leaning heavily on his slim iron spear. His contrasting pale blue robe was cinched firmly around his waist, by a belt securing a short hand-tooled Sudanese sword in a red leather scabbard. His traditional dress is displayed for the tourists visiting Père de Foucald hermitage at Assekrem, high in the shattered moonscape mountains of the Saharan Hoggar range, near Tamanrasset. The desert journey to reach this fantastic landscape is a scenic switchback of flat stony plains, and truck-trapping “fech-fech” sand basins, but the tribulations of the trail pale beside the exquisite, alluring dunes. Very high, and often crowned with a plume of wind-driven sand, they are a photographer’s paradise at dusk and dawn when the swirling golden crests are etched with dark shadows beneath a cold azure sky. \nJeff Chalk, from Somerset, wins a £350 voucher with DialAFlight More feedback from readers Kenya \nThe rite of passage for any young man leaving school in Kenya in the Sixties was to climb Kilimanjaro, preceded by a month’s hard training at the Outward Bound School at Loitokitok. Almost 50 years later, memories are still vivid of the slow, hot, unbelievably rough bus ride from Nairobi, followed by a daily routine of post-dawn wake-up calls, a run and a swim followed by mountain-craft classes, map reading and rough and ready meals (when we cut the mould off the bread). Fraught, challenging team expeditions, solo nights on the mountain (eating half-cooked porridge) and hours spent sleeping in caves all led, at last, to the ascent of Kilimanjaro. Mountain sickness at Gilmans Point was followed by a spectacular dawn and “job done” success at Uhuru Point. Unforgettable. \nAlastair Campbell, Morayshire \nA view of Mount Kilimanjaro, Kenya Photo: Fotolia/AP \nThe first time I went to Africa was as a volunteer teacher at a “harambee” (self-help) community school in western Kenya at the age of 18. Getting to the remote school involved traversing the beautiful Rift Valley, which completely entranced me. It felt like I was stepping back into a living prehistoric landscape, except the mammoth had evolved into an elephant and the crocodiles seemed to be in suspended animation. \nMount Longonot, the volcano, stood majestically observant over herds of humbug-striped zebras and comically long-necked giraffes. And further along the road, constructed by Italian prisoners of war, we reached the amazing Lake Nakuru where the flamingoes seemed like puffs of pink candyfloss in a copper-red landscape. Africa, and its overwhelming beauty, was to bring me back for years to come. \nWendy Winnard, Cheshire \nFlamingoes in Lake Nakuru Photo: Fotolia/AP Gambia \nThere are many recollections from my visit to Gambia, among them the drink derived from the natural fermentation of sap from a palm tree, and my wife nervously accepting an invitation to stroke one of the inhabitants at a crocodile farm. But my most treasured memory was during a “four-wheel-drive adventure” on which we saw, in a field, barefoot children playing with an abandoned tyre and some sticks. The sheer joy in their eyes was a lesson in life. \nTerry Harding, West Midlands Malawi \nThey say the fastest thing in Malawi is the sunset. This becomes evident at Chileka airport, as the uniformed official unhurriedly peruses passports, oblivious to the growing queue. In Malawi you need to change gear frequently, particularly if you drive yourself. Main roads are few and hazardous, riddled with potholes, the traffic dominated by overloaded, ageing minibuses whose drivers block any attempt to overtake. When you finally manage to edge past, you have to run the gauntlet of police roadblocks manned by officers who strike up conversation to alleviate the boredom of a day spent by a dusty road. Add kamikaze goats and a multiplicity of bicycles and you’ll realise that speed is not an option. So you acclimatise to the spirit of Malawi, returning the waves of roadside children. You’re in the “Warm Heart of Africa” and need time to appreciate it. \nJane Street, East Sussex \nA view of Lake Malawi Photo: Fotolia/AP South Africa \nAs we wait in traffic on the outskirts of Soweto, entrepreneurs tout their wares. Hand-crafted animals sell alongside phone covers from China. Those with nothing to sell tap on the windows; I pass out a few coins. Inequality slaps you in the face at every junction. Our guide is a proud Soweto resident. He takes us to Maggie’s house. Maggie, he assures us, makes double what she earned as a housemaid by charging tourists to look around her home – an “informal housing settlement”, or a tin shack to you and me. Stones hold the roof in place, corrugated iron forms the walls. But inside the one room Maggie shares with her three children, the walls are elaborately decorated with recycled paper and plastics. I wonder what she thought of us all. \nRachel Brown, Cornwall Morocco \nWe left behind a freezing London and walked out into the blue skies and sunshine of Marrakesh with its palm trees and camels. We took a tour with a Berber guide, walking with him into the foothills of the Atlas Mountains to meet his mum for lunch. She served a tasty meat tagine. Her house was small and simple, with a hole in the ground for a lavatory, but also an enormous flatscreen television. On our return we passed the local priest returning from market on his donkey cart, carrying a modest supply of provisions together with a very large satellite dish. Back in town the contrasts continued. An elderly man dressed in the traditional djellaba, the long woollen robe, thrust a hand into his pocket to retrieve his mobile phone. Visit soon before the “old” Africa disappears. \nKaren Barrett, Kent \nThe foothills of the Atlas Mountains in Tinghir, Morocco Photo: Fotolia/AP Zambia \nIt is night in the Zambian bush and the air is cool and crisp. I sit by the open fire, wrapped in my sleeping bag, breathing in the smell of the earth, fresh from a storm. The sky is an extravaganza of stars above, the Milky Way streaming over the treetops and moonlight sparkling off wet leaves. Over the wild, open grasslands I hear the throaty calls of lions. The piercing cries of the hyenas make my heart beat a little faster. Behind me I hear the grunts of hippos in the river and the gentle plop of water as they sink into its darkness. My senses are on fire; so clear and alive, excitement for the promise of morning, anticipation of the night ahead. \nJenna Ward, Shropshire \nA hyena in Zambia Photo: Fotolia/AP Tanzania \nA cheetah (left) sitting on a termite mound eyeing its breakfast; four pairs of rounded ears, peeping above the grass hiding a pride of lions resting after the hunt; a leopard draped over a low branch soaking up the early morning sun; the long, black tongue of a giraffe selecting the tender shoots from an acacia tree; and the cascade of wildebeest trying to avoid the snapping jaws of crocodiles as they migrate to the fresh green grass over the Mara River. Set against a huge sky and open plains, these are the true images of Africa in the fabulous Serengeti in Tanzania. \nMark Milbank, Dorset \nA cheetah and her cubs in Tanzania Photo: Fotolia/AP \nEach week we offer a prize to whoever sends us the best travel tip.
