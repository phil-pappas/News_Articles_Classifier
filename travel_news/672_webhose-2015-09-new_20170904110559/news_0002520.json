He started with me when he was about eight or nine years old, mainly Gaelic football. Luke went to the local school in Duglaise, an Irish-speaking school, and he did Gaelic games, which I was the co-ordinator for, and hurling, which was also my responsibility. I could tell after an hour that this guy had something special. Luke's hand-eye coordination and eye­to-ball coordination were very good. He had all the attributes back then. But there was a day, when he was about 10, that has made me very close to him. Luke collapsed. I had completed my course in first aid so I was able to tend to him and we got him off to the hospital. The medical staff said that it was only the fast work of the coach that stopped it being really serious. He’d swallowed his tongue. From that time Luke and I have had a close affinity to each other. Best back ever For me, Luke's attention to detail, his application to the rules, his innocence and the fact that he's so amenable, make him the best ever. I watched Luke Fitzgerald's performance and I was delighted he got his chance to perform against Canada in Ireland's opener in Rugby World Cup 2015 . I was very pleased with it considering that inside-centre isn't a position he's played too much of, but it's a position I know Luke likes. His handling of the ball was very good. It brought back memories of what he used to do when he was younger. Knowing Luke as well as I do, all he wants to do is wear the jersey All the things I saw so many years ago where all on display in that opening game against Canada. I also thought he was very unlucky not to get a couple of breaks and a try. That definitely would have capped his performance. Knowing Luke as well as I do, all he wants to do is wear the jersey. It's a badge of honour whenever anyone puts on a jersey for their country. He needs to be on the ball a lot, which is why inside-centre appeals to him. But I'm sure if he got the No 15 or any other position, he'd be just as happy with that. He gets into the ruck a lot. He does a lot of turnovers. It probably goes unnoticed because you have the more attractive runners on the outside. That's not taking anything away from their performance, but Luke likes to be in the mix. That's what we normally call it – being in the mix. Be in there, get the tackles in and get the turnovers in. Support from home I watched the Canada game with friends in the comfort of my own house. We had it on the big screen. We were commenting on a lot of players but my focus and attention was on Luke. I'll be in Dublin for the game on Sunday. I’ll get into a local hostelry and a group of us will watch the Romania game. I like to watch the games in my own comfort zone – in my home – or in the local club in Cork. You get an atmosphere and a feel for the game there. It's rare that I would go into a pub because I don't drink, but I like to get involved in situations and that's why I'm making an effort to get to a local hostelry on Sunday, just to get the vibe and the comments and feel the atmosphere. I like to be engrossed in it all. He's so happy to get messages from people who would have worked with him at a younger age I sent a message to Luke two weeks ago wishing him the best of luck in the game. I said I was delighted for him. I don't send too many now that he's in camp. I send them to his mother Andrea instead. She would then take the text message and wish the best of luck to him on our behalf. I know that Des, his father, who was a prop of course for Ireland, his mother Andrea, his three sisters and his brother all went to Cardiff for the opening game, and said it was a brilliant craic. Once the tournament is over, Luke sits down and gets back to all the messages he's missed. He's so happy to get messages from people who would have been working with him at a younger age. An inspiration I've just finished training a group of boys at Luke's old primary school in Dublin. During my coaching session with them, we spoke about Luke and his performance. It was a case of getting the message across to the young boys: look, there's someone special here playing for your country on TV. He started where you are now. I'm a great believer in sport orientation. Luke helps me in that, too, and has a great impression on the kids. Even though I'm a hurling and football coach, I encourage them all to play some kind of team game. The team game is so important for young people for activity and meeting new friends. Before, during and after, family is so important to Luke. I'm sure it's the same for everyone. Even when he was growing up here in Cork with me, they were extremely supportive. So were the girls. They'd be watching all his games, no matter the sport. Family is extremely important in relation to Luke. When it comes to the Rugby World Cup, hopefully Ireland have some success and I'll be expecting Luke to come to Cork at some stage. He visits the school whenever he's down in Cork. He would make his business to visit the school. I wouldn't even have to ask him. It's never a problem. He's never forgotten his roots. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T18:43:25.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
