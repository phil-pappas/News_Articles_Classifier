With Ashdown Park Hotel, & Country Club, Tylney Hall Hotel & Gardens, Luton Hoo Hotel, Golf & Spa, Warren Weir and The Grand Hotel Eastbourne taking part in the promotion, delegates could be taking to the skies following meetings, conferences or events across Sussex, Hampshire and Bedfordshire. \nResidential meetings of 20 delegates or more that also book team activities at the Elite venues will have the opportunity to nominate one delegate to receive full tuition from a qualified drone specialist, before taking the controls themselves and capturing their colleagues at play. Graeme Bateman, Managing Director, Elite Hotels commented: “All of the Elite properties offer exceptional team building activities either within the grounds or very nearby. We often get asked to provide a photographer to capture the moment for our clients, but this time we thought we would go one better. Not only will delegates experience the thrill of flying a drone, but the company will also receive the footage from the flight as a memento of the day, to use as they desire.” The Meetings that Drone package is available to all companies booking a residential meeting for over 20 delegates booking some kind of team activities as part of the event. In the case of inclement weather there are smaller indoor drones that can be used. The drone tuition, flights and footage, are all provided complimentary for qualifying events.
