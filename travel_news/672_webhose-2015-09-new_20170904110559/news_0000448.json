Here are five ideas to consider.\n• Eat local. For fresh-tasting and nutrient-rich meals, choose restaurants, diners and food trucks that feature local fruits, vegetables and other homegrown specialties. Visit a farmers market to support local growers and sample regional favorites.\nSome markets, including the one in Bellingham, Wash., feature special sections offering goods nurtured by children 18 and younger.\nVisit www.bellinghamfarmers.org  or www.localharvest.org  \n• Explore on foot. Take a walking tour of your next destination’s historic district. Tiptoe past haunted houses, stroll through flower-filled parks or seek urban blocks used in movie scenes. Head to a scenic national park for hikes through one-of-a-kind arches, around sandstone formations or along curving canyon walls.\nVisit www.nps.gov \n• Learn a new sport. Inspire enthusiasm among your family members by learning a skill together. Consider fat biking, a new way to roll on many types of terrain (including snow) using large, low-pressure tires. Curt Gowdy State Park, near Cheyenne, Wyo., has been grooming trails that will beckon riders this winter.\nIf watersports are more your style, consider stand-up paddleboarding.\nVisit cheyenneoutdoors.org or www.beaches.com  \n• Get off the grid. Put away the devices and spend a night or two camping in a nearby state or regional park.\nBetter yet, plan a grand adventure on the Galapagos Islands, 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. Stroll amid blue-footed boobies and marine iguanas before joining a Natural Habitat Foundation guide on an overnight camping adventure.\nVisit www.nathab.com  \n• Explore on two wheels. Spin beside the crystal-clear waters of New York’s Finger Lakes region for fresh air and breathtaking views. Named for the 11 pristine lakes that spread like fingers across central New York, the area offers 9,000 square miles of outdoor adventure with plenty of bike paths.\nFor more far-flung adventures, choose from more than 400 tours in 70 countries with Bike Tours Direct. Pick the degree of difficulty and destination that suits your clan.\nVisit www.fingerlakes.org  and www.biketours.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T15:57:59.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
