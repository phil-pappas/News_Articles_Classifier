It was based on teamwork, discipline and courage. I would have chosen the entire team to be heroes of the week if I could. As I am not allowed to do that, I have to pick out one of Japan’s players for this accolade. It has been very difficult. How do you compare the efforts and importance of a lock forward to that of a winger? It is nigh-on impossible. The front row of Kensuke Hatakeyama, Shota Horie and Masataka Mikami were crucial in denying the Springboks their usual scrum dominance. Horie managed to do what many players today say is impossible, hooking swift channel-one ball that was moved away from the scrum so quickly the South Africa back row was still scrummaging. His successful goalkicking under pressure kept Japan in touch as they chased the game Michael Leitch was immense in the back row, carrying and scrapping at the breakdown against a bigger, more powerful and habitually dominant Springboks three. Scrum-half Fumiaki Tanaka was outstanding. His accurate and swift service to his backs gave time and space to play against the South African rush defence. He also achieved the considerable feat of ripping the ball from the monstrous Schalk Burger, enabling Japan to clear 65 metres downfield. But I have gone for Japan’s full-back, Ayumu Goromaru, as my hero of the week. One sublime sidestep against Bismarck du Plessis should have brought a try. His successful goalkicking under pressure kept Japan in touch as they continually chased the game. He scored Japan’s second try, which brought them back into the fight soon after they conceded what could have been a confidence-draining try. Karne Hesketh’s last-second try secured a famous victory but Goromaru’s 24-point haul was the basis of that win.
