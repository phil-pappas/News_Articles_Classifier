Over the years guests have seen dancing bears, dangerous stunts and sampled a host of interesting street food to complement their pints of beer.\nThe idea originated in October 1810 when citizens of Munich were invited to attend the wedding festivities of the Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and the Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen.\nScroll down for video\nHere come the girls: A group of beer maids dressed in costume at Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany in October 1928\nGuests were able to ride upside-down cars in 1951 (left). Revellers could sample edible goodies from a range of food stands. Pictured right is Austrian singer and actress Hannelore Auer at the festival in 1981\nBeer was not the only lure to the Munich festival, with guests paying to watch a dancing bear in 1902\nThe event included a horse race, which ended up being repeated the following year. Quickly this evolved into an annual feature in the city which became known as Oktoberfest.\nMore attractions have became part of the event, including an agricultural show in 1811 and carousels and swings in 1818.\n Next From a Pimm's at Wimbledon to a Tim Tam in Sydney: Meet the...

The festival was originally held in October, as the name suggests, but was brought forward by one month to take advantage of better weather.\nThe signature feature of Oktoberfest - the beer - was originally sold from a few stands. However the demand grew so great that large tents and halls that could seat up to 94,000 people were later introduced.\nThe amount of the alcoholic beverage consumed has grown by a staggering number, with last year's total hitting 6.5 million litres of beer over the course of the festival's 16 days.\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Some of the internet's funniest reactions to bad plane food\nWatch video Cunard's flagship Queen Mary 2 cruise liner gets huge refub\nWatch video Tourists offered chance to stroke lions in the dead of night\nWatch video Passengers use industrial-strength cling film to secure luggage\nWatch video Meet the man who's been on 16 stag dos... all with strangers\nWatch video 'Do you know who I am?': Driver loses it in road rage rant\nWatch video Feuding dads bury the hatchet at daughter's wedding\nWatch video Sam Kellet is seen spear fishing before fatal shark attack\nWatch video Jim Carrey and Cathriona White spotted in NYC in May 2015\nWatch video See moment transgender teen discovers life changing hormones\nWatch video Wayne Rooney: The Man Behind The Goals trailer for BBC One\nWatch video Katy Perry makes a super fan's dream as she brings her on stage\nAttractions also included a range of unusual spectacles such as high-wire motorbike stunts in 1965\nTen to the dozen: Waitresses practice carrying 10 beer litre tankards each for the Oktoberfest in Munich in 1952\nGerman politician, Georg Kronawitter keg tapping at Oktoberfest 1989.

Although Oktoberfest began 205 years ago, this year marks the 182nd edition, as the party was cancelled during two world wars, two cholera outbreaks, Napoleon's invasion of Bavaria and the hyperinflation of the 1920s.\nThe 16-day festival now attracts visitors from all over the world, with the city's mayor, Dieter Reiter, saying three million people visited the grounds in the festival's first week this year.\nPrices for a 'Mass' or large glass of beer have soared in recent years and will now set drinkers back between €10 (£7.30) and €10.40 (£7.60).\nFrench director and actor, Roman Polanski enjoying a large pretzel at Oktoberfest in 1986 (left).
