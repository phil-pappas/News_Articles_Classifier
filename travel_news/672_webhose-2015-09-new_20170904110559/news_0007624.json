As to be expected, the home is full of brightly hued rooms (like a poolside casita with pink walls and a crystal chandelier), over-the-top art (including a print of Andy Warhol's portrait of Taylor over the fireplace and a painting of two deer done by La Liz herself), and rococo furnishings (Louis XIV–inspired chairs and statuary abound).\nPalm Springs has been a getaway for Hollywood glitterati since the 1920s, gaining its popularity due to movie studios' \"two-hour rule,\" which meant that actors needed to stay within 120 minutes' drive of L.A. in case a production or director needed them for reshoots. Stars like Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, and Mary Pickford flocked to the sunny Coachella Valley hideaway where they could decompress from the Tinseltown pressure and enjoy relative privacy.\nIt's rare for mere civilians to be able to rent out stars' Palm Springs homes, even their ex-homes (Taylor owned the low-slung modern house from 2004 until her death, at age 79, in 2011). The rental has four bedrooms on over a half-acre of land, all hidden behind a high privacy fence with views of the San Jacinto Mountains.\nViolet satin sheets and leopard print throws in the bedrooms, a gleaming grand piano in the living room, and marble-everything kitchen may not be the decor you would choose for your own home, but Casa Elizabeth will you allow you to channel the all-out kitschy glamor of Taylor’s later years.\nBest of all? With prices starting from $140 per bedroom a night, it’s cheaper to stay in this legend's home than in many Palm Springs hotels (the Parker averages about $300 a night).\nMore from Condé Nast Traveler:\nThe 2015 Friendliest and Unfriendliest Cities Around the World\n100 Top Hotels & Resorts in the World\n50 Things to Do in the U.S. Before You Die\n ", "external_links": ["http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdTjxb%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdTqWy.img&description=Courtesy+McLean+Rental+Company", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2014-10-20/top-100-hotels-and-resorts-in-the-world-rca-2014?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdTjxb%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdTJ2t.img&description=Courtesy+McLean+Rental+Company", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-06-27/things-to-do-in-america-all-50-us-states?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2015-08-14/the-2015-friendliest-and-unfriendliest-cities-in-the-world?mbid=synd_msntravel", "http://www.cntraveler.com/?mbid=synd_msn"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T11:46:54.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
