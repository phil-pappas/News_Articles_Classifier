There is interest on both sides to move the collaboration between the two countries a step higher than we are at the moment… In terms of the Ashanti Kingdom, the Ashanti offspring is here, and it was so good you brought the Ashanti King during the Carnival to come to Seychelles, and that to me was the beginning of a cultural relationship that should have been developed long ago. Seychelles gave a home to the exiles, the Ashanti and his entourage,” said High Commissioner Ahwoi. \nAlso present during the meeting were the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Transport, Joel Morgan, and the President's Diplomatic Adviser, Ambassador Callixte D’Offay. \nThe Ghanaian High Commissioner is based in Pretoria, South Africa. \nSeychelles and Ghana established formal diplomatic relations on October 10, 1988 and High Commissioner Ahwoi is the second to be accredited to the Republic of Seychelles. \nSeychelles is a founding member of the International Coalition of Tourism Partners (ICTP) .
