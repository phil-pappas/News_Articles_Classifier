Activities had been planned at rivers nationwide and even internationally, with expat Costa Ricans honoring their country’s natural treasures from afar. \n“For the organizing team it’s very sad to communicate this news, but citizen safety is our top priority,” architect Alonso Briseño, the director and founder of Río Urbano, said in a statement Saturday. \nVisit the Río Urbano Facebook page for more information.
