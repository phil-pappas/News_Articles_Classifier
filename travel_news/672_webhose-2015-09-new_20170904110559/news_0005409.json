As the hotel plans to undergo another facelift in the form of guest room renovations, this may spur travel plans for regulars looking to experience the hotel as-is one last time. \nParty like it’s 1990 For a week leading up to Oct. 15, the date of the hotel’s anniversary, consumers can book a luxury room package. Priced at $2,500, the offer includes a two-night stay in an executive suite, a prix fixe dinner and a time capsule containing mementos of the 1990s. \nOn Oct. 15, the hotel will encourage guests and visitors to join in the fun. A backdrop spread alongside the entrance will encourage selfies from attendees, who will be prompted to share the results on social media with the brand-wide hashtag #RCMemories. \nOnce inside, guests will be treated to cake pops and Champagne as they enjoy a soundtrack of ‘90s tunes. Ritz-Carlton will test their knowledge of the decade with a questionnaire, which will enter consumers into a contest for a 25 percent discount on logoed items in the gift shop. \nOutdoors at Ritz-Carlton Marina del Rey \nThrough the month of October, guests who book 60-minute or longer spa treatments will receive $25 off. \nBeyond joining together locals and travelers, this celebration is also for the hotel employees, 13 of whom have been with the property since the beginning. \n“This is a time when we celebrate those who have been here since our opening, and embrace the culture of The Ritz-Carlton and what it has meant to each and every lady or gentleman that has made an impact throughout our day-to-day operations,” said Tony Mira, the hotel’s general manager, in a statement. “We look forward to what the next quarter-century brings us in the ever-changing industry where we are proud to be leaders.” \nHotels commonly celebrate their anniversaries by giving their properties a new look. Peninsula Hotel Hong Kong celebrated its 85th anniversary in 2013 with a gala evening that featured work from Hong Kong artist Lee Chi Ching. The celebration was imbued with additional significance because the property completed a $58 million room enhancement project earlier in the year. Anniversary celebrations not only impart a sense of credibility, but also provide hotels with a jumping-off point for numerous campaigns ( see story ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:50:02.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
