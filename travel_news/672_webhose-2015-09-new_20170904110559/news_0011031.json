We are pleased to have paid our employees more than $1 million for their performance through this period of transition and exceptional growth. Not only does this level of performance ensure our existing operations, it is a real ‘selling point’ when we are competing for new business.”\nPaul Foley, Mesa’s Chief Operating Officer, added, “What makes this achievement even more\nremarkable is the fact that we added so many aircraft to our fleet and all were in service on or ahead of schedule. Working together with our frontline employees, we believe Mesa is\nincredibly well positioned to take advantage of future growth opportunities.”\nMesa currently operates a fleet of 113 regional jets under the American Eagle, US Airways\nExpress and United Express brands. With current scheduled deliveries, Mesa’s fleet will grow to 115 by the end of this month. In addition, for the third consecutive year, Mesa Airlines’ Maintenance and Engineering Department was awarded the FAA’s prestigious Diamond Award of Excellence.\nSource:- Mesa Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:14:00.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
