The findings demonstrate the need for trays to be cleaned between flights. \n\"What is needed is a procedure for increased efficiency of boarding and deplaning that gives the cabin crew more time to do a thorough cleaning between flights\", the study said. \nIn airports, the least sanitary place by far to touch is drinking fountain buttons with 1,240 CFU/sq. inch, the research found. \nTests done by the National Science Foundation in the US show that the average home toilet seat has just 172 CFU/sq. inch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:38:03.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
