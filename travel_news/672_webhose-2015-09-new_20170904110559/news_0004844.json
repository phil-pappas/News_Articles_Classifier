The ARTS Council of the Southern Finger Lakes held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday at the organization's Corning headquarters to celebrate the launch of the Points of Inspiration driving trails. One of the trails, the Architecture Trail, features such sites as the Corning Museum of Glass, the Finger Lakes Boating Museum in Hammondsport, Bath's First Presbyerian Church and Corning's Gaffer District. The second trail, the Scenic View Trail, includes the Canisteo Living Sign, Stony Brook State Park, the Harris Hill Overlook and Watkins Glen State Park among others. Connie Sullivan-Blum, executive director of the ARTS Council for the Southern Finger Lakes, said she came up with the Points of Inspiration concept after attending a Steuben County leadership conference. \"It's the kind of conference where the soil people meet and the people run your water systems meet,\" Sullivan-Blum said. \"It's really nuts and bolts, how they run the county. The executive director of the ARTS Council at the time (Virginia Lupi) told me 'you know, I really think you should go hear this speaker.' \"I went to that meeting and it was a woman named Elizabeth Watson and she was talking about cultural heritage regions. The whole idea really excited me, this idea that you could take what really exists — a group of people, a culture that really exists in your region and just celebrate that in a way that lets visitors know you are but it isn't candy-coated.\" Sullivan-Blum spoke with Peggy Coleman, president of the Steuben County Conference and Visitors Bureau, who approved of the idea. \"We just started brainstorming 'how could this work?\" Sullivan-Blum said. \"We drew together every single arts and cultural organization we could think of in the three-county region ... We had a really comprehensive list. At that first meeting, 22 arts and cultural organizations came together.\" Those 22 organizations spent the day at Heritage Village in Corning and came to the conclusion that the driving trails would be the best strategy to promote the culture of the area. The architectural and scenic routes were chosen because funding wouldn't be the major issue and the organizations believed it wouldn't take much work to figure out. \"Well, we were kind of wrong about that,\" Sullivan-Blum said. In total, 33 sites were selected to be part of the inaugural trail experience. With the amount of architecture and scenery available in the Southern Finger Lakes, cutting down the list was a long process. A steering committee meant to pick the sites included the Chemung County Chamber of Commerce, the Chemung County Historical Society, the Steuben County Conference and Visitors Bureau, The ARTS Council of the Southern Finger Lakes, and the Watkins Glen Area Chamber of Commerce.

It is definitely taking off and people feel excited about it ... If this translates into more visitors, then it translates into more tourism dollars in our area. More people eating in restaurants, more people with overnight stays and that kind of thing. I see it as kind of an economic development program.\" Sullivan-Blum noted the trails were created with multi-day trips in mind, even though visitors are more than welcome to tackle a portion at a time. The best part of the Points of Inspiration effort, according to Sullivan-Blum, is that it didn't take a state or federal missive to put the trails together — it was just a group of organizations looking to improve the community. \"This whole thing started in 2014 and one of the things I'm most proud of is how it was really built from a community effort,\" Sullivan-Blum said. \"It's not coming from a top-down situation and it's such a grassroots effort.\" However, the Points of Inspiration trails could look significantly different in 2016. A geocache adventure will be launched this coming spring. \"This next one we've decided to seek some help with planning so that we can really plan for the future, what our cultural heritage region could look like 10 years from now,\" Sullivan-Blum said. \"We're not just doing short-term thinking about this, we're doing long-term thinking about it. \"I think there's a way in which what I'd like to see is for us to have a pride about our place, our area that we are unique and there are reasons why someone would want to live here, someone would want to visit here. We have beautiful places and we have a lot of cultural offerings, a lot of rich history and I would like to see this be a part of building that pride in the community about who we are.\" By Ryan Papaserge/The Evening Tribune The Evening Tribune By Ryan Papaserge/The Evening Tribune Posted Sep. 28, 2015 at 5:33 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T17:43:44.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
