The changes are effective immediately.\nUnited said Smisek's departure and those of several other top United executives are tied to the company's previously disclosed internal investigation of a federal investigation associated with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n\"The investigations are ongoing and the company continues to cooperate with the government,\" United said in a statement.\nAlso stepping down immediately are United's executive vice president of communications and government affairs, Nene Foxhall, and its senior vice president of corporate and government affairs, Mark R. Anderson, also in connection with the federal probe.\nUnited said the company's internal investigation and \"the related circumstances\" do not raise any accounting or financial reporting concerns.\nUnited disclosed earlier this year that the company and some of its executives had received subpoenas from a federal grand jury for information about its dealings with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York Times reported .\nThe subpoenas focused on whether the former chairman of the Port Authority, David Samson, had pushed United to reinstate flights that he used to travel to and from his weekend home in South Carolina, the Times said.\nUnited began about twice-weekly direct flights from Newark to Columbia that launched after Samson became chairman of the Port Authority and were canceled days after he resigned last year.\nSmisek joined Continental Airlines in 1995 as senior vice president and general counsel. He was named Continental's president in December 2004 and added the title of chief operating officer in September 2008. In January 2010, he succeeded Larry Kellner as chairman and CEO while keeping the president's title.\nIn May 2010, he helped engineer the merger of Continental and United to form United Continental Holdings. At United Continental, Smisek had the titles of president and CEO, and United's pre-merger chairman, president and CEO Glenn Tilton, held the title of chairman. In December 2012, when Tilton retired, Smisek took over the chairmanship of United Continental as well.\nThe United-Continental consolidation raised immediate concern in Cleveland that as Continental's smallest hub except for its operations in Micronesia, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport would be on the losing end of the merger.\nThe fears proved well-founded. In February 2014, the merged United announced it was stripping its hub out of Cleveland, reducing its schedule here from 199 peak day departures to 70 by summer. United also slashed the number of nonstop routes it flew to fewer than 20, down from 59.\nAviation consultant Michael Boyd said as much as Smisek may have local detractors because of the loss of the Hopkins hub, his departure from the merged United \"has nothing to do with Cleveland.\"\nUnited remains the busiest carrier at Hopkins, with about 60 departures a day.\nSmisek's separation agreement says he'll receive a lump sum payment of $4,875,000 and remain eligible for a pro-rated \"annual incentive award.\" He will have health insurance until he is eligible for Medicare, a company car and retain United flight benefits and parking privileges for life, according to a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nMunoz, a member of the United board since 2010, previously was president and chief operating officer of CSX Corp., as well as serving as a CSX director. Before that, he held various senior financial and strategic positions at AT&T Consumer Services, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. He was on the board of directors of Continental from 2004 to 2010.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/business/united-ceo-port-authority-investigation.html?_r=0", "http://ir.united.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=83680&p=irol-IRHome", "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/100517/000110465915064079/a15-19109_1ex10d1.htm"], "published": "2015-09-09T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T05:55:52.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
