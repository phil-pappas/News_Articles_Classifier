I was born in the countryside nearby and think of it as home.\nIt isn’t a city that has soaked up many outside influences . It’s a very Tuscan place, one with fortified walls and big city gates, le porte . In one part of the city walls, you can still see what was once a fireplace and a little window and you can imagine the man who used to sit there and take the tax ( dazio ) from the country folk for entering the city.\nDocumentary film-maker Cosima Spender The world’s first bank, the Monte dei Paschi, was established in Siena in 1472 and the cheque was invented there, too. In fact, the Palio horse race in a way helps commemorate those glory days, when the city and the Sienese people were dominant.\nThe Palio is only a 90-second horse race but the plotting and scheming last all year. There are two races, one in July and one in August, and 10 of the 17 districts ( contrade ) are allocated a horse in a draw that takes place in front of the whole city in the main square, Piazza del Campo. Throughout the year, the districts are constantly making deals with each other, saying things like: “If we get a really good horse but you get a bad one, we’ll pay you to ‘take care’ of our rival at the start of the race.” It’s so political – there are all these intrigues and games going on, with the districts fundraising and campaigning for money throughout the year to fuel these schemes. And at the end of it, all they win is a banner!\nSuccess for a district or a jockey at the Palio requires being clever . It’s a celebration of cunning – and a desperate attempt by humans to control fate and life. It’s like when you play poker and you bluff; it’s not cheating, you’re just being a good poker player.\nFor four days in July and August when the Palio takes place Siena becomes a state within itself; the Sienese don’t look beyond their own walls. And they admit they’re crazy. I have friends who tell me that around Palio time they skip the first few pages of newspapers just to get to the Palio news.\nThe Palio gets under way. Photograph: Alamy The jockeys used to be decadent playboy types but now they are professional and train all the time. They also have to be bright enough to make deals and wise enough to get around the difficult Piazza del Campo track.\nIt’s free to stand in the middle of the square for the Palio. You need to get there early and the view isn’t that good, but the atmosphere is fantastic and you get a real sense of the collective passion. Just before the lineup for the Palio is called out, the whole square falls silent: 50,000 people and you could hear a pin drop.\nSaint Catherine of Siena fasted so much she had hallucinations , and ultimately found herself in an ecstatic state with God. I find her a fascinating character. One walk I love starts at the Basilica of San Domenico and follows the alleys past her house and then towards the back of the Duomo. You pass a stunning view, on your right, of San Domenico with green fields of the countryside below. Then it’s on up to the Duomo and baptistry (Battistero di San Giovanni), on a route that’s higgledy-piggledy, very up and down, but a beautiful way to experience the city.\nThe Duomo di Siena. Photograph: Julian Elliott/Robert Harding It’s rather touristy but you must visit the Palazzo Pubblico (town hall) to see the incredible series of frescoes by Lorenzetti. They’re known as the Allegory of Good and Bad Government and were meant to encourage the governors of the city to behave in a just way. It really shows you what Siena was like in the 14th century.\nIf you want to eat something truly Sienese – and delicious – it has to be pici al ragù a fat, handmade pasta, almost like noodles, served with meaty sauce. My kids go crazy for it. I love it too, but, you know, you have to watch how much pasta you eat.\nA detail from one of Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s Allegory of Good and Bad Government frescoes.

It is not the most well known of Siena’s restaurants but it has delicious food and a great atmosphere.\nThe Monte dei Paschi bank, which has sponsored the city a lot , has been in financial trouble recently, so Siena needs its new startups and should look to attract tourists in a different way – they shouldn’t just end up walking along the main street when they visit.\n• Palio is released in the UK on 25 September, gb.thepalio.com/film #PalioFilm\n• 10 of the best ways to enjoy Florence on a budget", "external_links": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488726341/8a8e4b65-f00b-4e3c-bca0-c5430196d089-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=57d4d34bd37558d38b73bd5cd36ed0ac", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488342864/8774fd61-107e-4a60-9dc5-606e2e877799-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=cf90e222b3b6c4fa4569a4a85dc476da", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488560418/1146b7fb-ce34-498d-bb5e-2e8a5bc85816-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0600a2db13ca139d733ffdfdcb166826", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442491604142/381ddeb2-f473-4a38-96c5-57eac2ac3b71-620x590.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=9409db6f7ec7a7c47592f490d0b5df12", "http://www.osteriadadivo.it/eng/chi-siamo.htm", "http://gb.thepalio.com/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442491604142/381ddeb2-f473-4a38-96c5-57eac2ac3b71-620x590.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=99d9c868fe234b5c0719ca10ef2da923", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442491604142/381ddeb2-f473-4a38-96c5-57eac2ac3b71-620x590.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=a0630950b27d4da4ba3967b77ad62d31", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488560418/1146b7fb-ce34-498d-bb5e-2e8a5bc85816-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d12c36a267f7e827568919f620b4bca3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488726341/8a8e4b65-f00b-4e3c-bca0-c5430196d089-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=407612db6d72881ddba9a6f893f58e54", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488560418/1146b7fb-ce34-498d-bb5e-2e8a5bc85816-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=4fb667d5c8d753420b67356c8c448c77", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442491604142/381ddeb2-f473-4a38-96c5-57eac2ac3b71-620x590.jpeg?w=380&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=5c129e99d389793a959a1da7e6095e4a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488726341/8a8e4b65-f00b-4e3c-bca0-c5430196d089-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=7cf8e2bd328e6204900eb6e707573c56", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488726341/8a8e4b65-f00b-4e3c-bca0-c5430196d089-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=9d99f013a3c90ac5453a27f0c0fc2504", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/paliofilm", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488342864/8774fd61-107e-4a60-9dc5-606e2e877799-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=482db5454db34733b480f39da8fdcfe1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488342864/8774fd61-107e-4a60-9dc5-606e2e877799-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=5b169fa923d8bcdfaff878f787f7334b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488342864/8774fd61-107e-4a60-9dc5-606e2e877799-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d5abbfba709cb2b06eb163b17fc839ba", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442491604142/381ddeb2-f473-4a38-96c5-57eac2ac3b71-620x590.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0a0d02ecf93008a603b6b259cd64a0b1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/17/1442488560418/1146b7fb-ce34-498d-bb5e-2e8a5bc85816-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=0951556597c7bb80bee239abdd3c08ec"], "published": "2015-09-18T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:20:00.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
