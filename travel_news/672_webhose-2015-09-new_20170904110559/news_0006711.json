This annual event, organised by the Cruise Lines International Association, is designed to get holidaymakers thinking about and booking cruises through generous offers and events. To get you started here is taster of what’s on board. Rooms with a view Cruise lines shy away from the word cabin in favour of “stateroom” because of outdated connotations. And no wonder: accommodation on board has come a long way since the days of Lord Nelson and HMS Victory. While the cheapest cabins don’t usually have windows, some now offer a “virtual porthole”. Disney Cruise Line got there first in 2011, providing a “view” in inside cabins on Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy via a camera on the hull that projects real-time images on to a screen. Royal Caribbean International will take things a step further on board its soon-to-launch Harmony and Ovation of the Seas, both of which will feature inside cabins with virtual balconies. These debuted on Quantum and Anthem of the Seas, and are being retro-fitted to other vessels. A virtual balcony on Anthem of the Seas If you can afford to trade up, Norwegian Cruise Line and MSC Cruises have suites located away from the main accommodation decks, while Celebrity Cruises ’ new Suite Class comes with perks that include a private restaurant and free drinks. Royal Caribbean will have something similar from May 2016 when Royal Suite Class, a new class of accommodation affording a raft of privileges, is rolled out on its Oasis and Quantum-class ships. Anyone booking a two-storey Loft Suite will also be allocated a Royal Genie (personal assistant) trained by the British Butler Institute. Modern cabins have en-suites, minibars, safes and flatscreen Wi-Fi enabled televisions. The best suite on Regent Seven Seas Cruises ’ new Seven Seas Explorer, launching next July, comes with its own spa and treatments included. Best for families The newest of the larger vessels offer more diversions for children than you’ll find at most resorts. Carnival Cruise Line says 700,000 children aged 17 and under will cruise on its ships this year, and thousands more youngsters travel with the likes of Disney, Royal Caribbean, NCL and P&O Cruises . With private pool areas, aqua parks, ropes courses, surf simulators and children’s clubs for almost all age groups, it’s no wonder. Carnival’s new ship, Carnival Vista, launching in the Mediterranean next May, will feature a pedal-powered SkyRide, a suspended track looping the ship’s top deck. It will also have the largest WaterWorks aqua park in the Carnival fleet and the first IMAX theatre at sea. Royal Caribbean’s new Harmony of the Seas has Ultimate Abyss, a 100ft-long water slide. NCL’s Norwegian Escape, sailing the Caribbean from Miami this autumn, has a ropes course with zipwires and a racing waterslide called Aqua Racer. The Aqua Park on Norwegian Escape In the Cookery Club on board P&O’s Britannia, children and adults can try everything from bread- and pasta-making to cake decorating. Classes cost from £45 for two hours for one adult and two children. Food for thought Fixed dining, where you are allocated a table and a time to dine, has been going out of fashion over the past decade. Even Cunard , which sells itself on tradition, has recognised that cruisers want more flexibility. It will add 30 Britannia Club balcony cabins to Queen Mary 2 during a refit next May: these come with a restaurant where guests can dine at a time of their choosing. Companies including Silversea , Regent, NCL, Seabourn and Oceania Cruises have offered flexible dining for years, and others are following suit. Choose MSC’s Aurea fare package and you can eat when you like in a dedicated area of the restaurant. Royal Caribbean passengers have the option of My Time Dining (reserve a table to eat between 6pm-9.30pm) and My Time Family Dining (children are served first and then picked up by Adventure Ocean Kids Club staff). Dining at sea is not just about when you eat, but what you eat. From French bistros to teppanyaki bars the choice is endless. Jamie Oliver opened his first restaurant at sea on Royal Caribbean’s Quantum of the Seas and master chef Nobuyuki “Nobu” Matsuhisa has the Sushi Bar and Silk Road restaurant on board Crystal Symphony and Serenity . P&O Cruises has gone to town with a celebrity chef line-up that includes BBC Saturday Kitchen presenter James Martin along with Marco Pierre White, Michelin-starred Atul Kochhar and pâtissier Eric Lanlard. All will be holding cookery classes and participating in Q&A sessions and book signings on selected cruises this year and next. Viking Ocean Cruises also has a cookery school on its first ship, Viking Star, where passengers can prepare and dine on their culinary creations. Regent will offer something similar on the new Seven Seas Explorer. Dessert on board a Crystal Cruises ship Photo: Udi Goren ©2013 Innovation on board Enrichment, or on-board learning and activities, runs the gamut from golf and language tuition to zumba and cocktail-making classes. Crystal and MSC Cruises have new medi-spa treatments that promise to iron out wrinkles. MSC charges from €270 (£196) for a treatment. Those who enjoy singing can seek fame on Princess Cruises ’ ships Regal Princess (from October), Royal and Caribbean Princess (from November) and on eight other Princess ships next year when the company launches The Voice of the Ocean. Participants will have to audition, make time to rehearse and sing at a live finale. Professional dancers and judges from BBC One’s Strictly Come Dancing will bring the glamour of the ballroom to P&O sailings next year, while Holland America Line ’s new ship, Koningsdam, launching in April 2016, has a dedicated area called Music Walk where you can listen to live classical music, tunes from America’s Billboard chart or soul and jazz in BB King’s Blues Club. Exploring ashore Foodies signing up for Oceania Cruises’ new two- and three-night Culinary Creations Land Tours next year can indulge their passion on visits to local markets and at cooking schools and restaurants. The tours are available as pre-, post- and mid-cruise options on selected sailings. During a three-night pre-cruise stay in Athens, for example, participants will prepare traditional Greek dishes, enjoy lunch cooked by a Michelin-starred chef and attend wine and ouzo tastings. (From £838pp including daily breakfast and lunch, and one dinner). For something more exotic, join one of river cruise line APT ’s voyages on the Mekong in Cambodia and Vietnam to learn about local cuisine and enjoy a three-course banquet prepared by Vietnamese chef and restaurateur Luke Nguyen in Ho Chi Minh City – all included in the cruise fare. Starting in January, Celebrity Cruises is offering evening tours on Caribbean voyages that overnight in selected ports. There are jazz parties in Cozumel, Mexico, a sunset cruise in Aruba and horse-drawn carriage tours in Cartagena, Colombia. From US$45pp (£29). Telegraph Cruise & Travel Show Monty Halls will be speaking at next month’s Telegraph Cruise & Travel Show about his adventures in the Galapagos and the Sardine Run in South Africa. The former Royal Marine turned travel adventurer will headline the show, being held at Exhibition Centre Liverpool on Saturday October 17 and Sunday 18, 2015. Over 50 cruise and travel brands will be exhibiting, along with Telegraph journalists and cruise and travel experts. Tickets on the day cost £10; advance prices available (Quote: : CRUISE25).
