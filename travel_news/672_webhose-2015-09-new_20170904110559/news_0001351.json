Pictured is a file photo of a female Funnell Web Spider \nAn English man has told how his leg 'burst open' after he was bitten by a deadly spider during a flight. \nBarrister Jonathon Hogg almost lost his leg as a result of the bite onboard the plane between Qatar and South Africa. \n\"By the time I got to hospital my leg was bursting open, there was pus, it was black. It was a right mess,\" he told the Daily Mail. \n\"They told me if I had been any later I would have lost my leg or even died.\" \nREAD MORE: \n* Scientist discover possible gian new funnel web spider species \nIn a bid to save his limb surgeons had to cut away a large part of his leg where the venom had eaten the flesh. \nHogg, 40, spent a month in hospital in South Africa, undergoing three operations and a skin graft, but three months on is still receiving medical treatment. \nThe keen footballer and kickboxer told the Daily Mail he was terrified of flying and feared he would never play sport again. \nHogg, a barrister, had taken five months off work and worked at an orangutan sanctuary in Borneo before travelling to South Africa in June to dive with sharks when his ordeal began. Ad Feedback \nSix hours into a flight from Doha to Cape Town, he felt a pain in his leg before spotting a spider running across the floor. \nDoctors diagnosed the bite as from a brown recluse spider, which is venomous and potentially fatal, and warned him he could have lost his leg or even died if he had not been treated. \nAfter an operation to remove the dead flesh, Hogg was horrified to see the damage. \nHe told the Daily Mail: \"I knew something was wrong but I had no idea how bad it was until I spoke with the surgeon. When he told me how close I had come to losing my leg I was stunned.\" \n\"It really hit home when they removed the bandages and I saw what was left of my leg – it resembled something from a horror film. \n\"They had been forced to cut away so much, I was devastated. \n\"However when I realised the extent of my injuries, I realised I was just lucky to still have my leg – even if the sight of my leg shocked me when I finally saw it.\" \nHogg has now launched legal action against the airline, Qatar Airways, which he says has refused to accept responsibility. \n\"They have made no attempt to resolve the issue and have basically said it was nothing to do with them. All this has left me very traumatised but determined to seek justice. \nIn November, five-year-old Branson Riley Carlisle, from Albertsville in Alabama, US, died after he was bitten by a brown recluse spider. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T10:04:53.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
