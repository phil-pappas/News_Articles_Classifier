The projected sales will be a 10.1 percent decrease from August 2015 , but a 13.9 percent increase from September 2014 . This will make this month's sales volume the biggest September since 2004, and the sales rate will be the biggest September SAAR since 2000.\nThe month's impressive sales come as Volkswagen continues to deal with its highly-publicized crisis in which it admitted to using a \"cheat device\" to pass EPA emissions tests for many of its iconic diesel-powered vehicles. The crisis has had very little impact on consumer confidence in the overall industry, even as it proves to be a self-inflicted wound for the German automaker. In fact, Edmunds projects that Volkswagen/Audi will be the only major manufacturer to post year-over-year sales losses (-2.0 percent) in September.\n\"Volkswagen's deception is dominating headlines, but it is not keeping shoppers away from other brands' showrooms,\" says Edmunds.com Director of Industry Analysis Jessica Caldwell . \"It puts the crisis in a little bit of perspective, since these Volkswagen diesels don't constitute a very big share of sales. It's also a reminder that buyers won't disappear from the market just because they suddenly can't or don't want to buy these affected cars. They're willing to turn to other automakers that will meet their needs.\"\nSALES VOLUME FORECAST, BY MANUFACTURER\nSales Volume\nSeptember 2015 Forecast\nSeptember 2014\nAugust 2015\nChange from September 2014\nChange from August 2015\nGM\n239,603\n223,437\n270,480\n7.2%\n-11.4%\nFord\n218,921\n179,518\n233,880\n21.9%\n-6.4%\nToyota\n194,515\n167,279\n224,381\n16.3%\n-13.3%\nFCA\n194,423\n169,890\n201,672\n14.4%\n-3.6%\nHonda\n134,155\n118,223\n155,491\n13.5%\n-13.7%\nNissan\n118,117\n102,955\n133,351\n14.7%\n-11.4%\nHyundai/Kia\n114,894\n96,638\n130,909\n18.9%\n-12.2%\nVW/Audi\n40,110\n40,913\n51,126\n-2.0%\n-21.5%\nIndustry\n1,415,436\n1,242,527\n1,573,590\n13.9%\n-10.1%\n*NOTE: September 2015 had 25 selling days, September 2014 had 24 and August 2015 had 26.\nEdmunds.com estimates that retail SAAR will come in at 15.2 million vehicles in September, with fleet transactions accounting for 14.8 percent of total sales.
