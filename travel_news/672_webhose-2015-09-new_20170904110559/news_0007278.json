Increasingly, food is one of the key factors in choosing a holiday destination. The sophisticated palate of today’s traveller expects quality, variety and authenticity, which is where the Sandals Gourmet Discovery Dining programme delivers by the plateful. With up to 16 restaurants per resort – the highest eaterie-per-guest ratio in the Caribbean – you can sample the world’s most enticing gourmet traditions without ever leaving your resort. How about some spicy local dishes in a plantation-style villa? Or a catch-of-the-day seafood extravaganza with a chilled wine tailored to your choice in a glamorous, over-the-water restaurant? A New York-style hot dog from a cart by the pool or a Miami Vice cocktail at the swim-up bar? No problem. At each Sandals resort, from Jamaica to Grenada, Antigua to St Lucia, Barbados to The Bahamas, trained chefs create extensive menus from more than 19 different cuisines: Italian, Pan-Asian, Caribbean, Japanese, Thai, Indian, French, British, Mediterranean, Southwest United States, Mexican... You name it, they’ll make it. Eat what you want, when you want. That’s the philosophy and you can only embrace the freedom of unscripted days and nights Don’t expect blanket-themed restaurants; these chefs take pride in their specialities and regional creations. It might be teppanyaki or sushi (don’t miss the crispy Caribbean-spice tuna rolls), French à la carte at Le Jardinier or world-class steaks at Butch’s Chophouse, Jamaican seafood at Stew Fish or Ligurian classics at Portofino’s. It could simply be the perfect wood-fired Neapolitan pizza or a plate of good old English fish and chips. And when it comes to staple ingredients, they source the best. Think Blue Mountain Coffee from Jamaica, lobster caught by the day and freshly squeezed exotic fruit juices. Ask for cognac and you get Remy VSOP. Whereas other resorts cluster “food offers” in one area, Sandals has created individual spots within its seaside garden landscape to foster a unique ambience according to the restaurant or café style. Everything is included – wines, signature rum punch and other bar favourites, whether that’s a premium-brand spirit or local brew special to the island. You never have to pay extra. Eat what you want, when you want. That’s the philosophy and you can only embrace the freedom of unscripted days and nights. Savour seafood with sand underfoot at Barefoot by the Sea or enjoy local cuisine overlooking the pool. Linger over a romantic candlelit dinner enjoying views from Sunset Bluff, opt for a theatrical teppanyaki experience or relax in wicker chairs at the Café de Paris. The staff, keen to share their passions and recommendations, make the dining experience top-notch. It’s down to the little details, like finding the plate for your pudding on your last night has “Come back soon” written in chocolate. • For more information on Caribbean holidays, visit sandals.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T20:36:33.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
