That would be down from £681m made in the 2014-15 year.\nSainsbury’s has shown greater resilience to the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl than its big four rivals, market leader Tesco, Wal-Mart’s Asda and Morrisons, helped by the continued expansion of its convenience store estate.\nHowever, its sales at stores open over a year still fell 1.1%, excluding fuel, in the 16 weeks to September 26, its financial second quarter, hurt by fierce competition with rivals that has contributed to ongoing price deflation.\nThat compared with analysts’ average forecast of a decline of 1.3% and a fall of 2.1% in the previous quarter.\nSainsbury’s total sales, excluding fuel, rose 0.3%. \"During the quarter we saw an improvement in our key trading metrics. Both volume and transactions grew as the decline in average basket spend in supermarkets continued to stabilise,\" CEO Mike Coupe said.\n\"Whilst the market is clearly still challenging, with food deflation impacting many categories, we are making good progress on delivering our strategy.\"\nSainsbury’s, in common with its major rivals, is battling to stem the flow of shoppers to the discounters through price cuts and improvements to product quality and service, financed by cost savings and dividend reductions.\nMr Coupe has previously said he expects like-for-like sales to be negative in the full 2015-16 year.\nShares in Sainsbury’s, down 13% over the past six months, closed at 229.3p on Tuesday, valuing the business at £4.42bn.\nEarlier this month Morrisons posted a 2.4% fall in second-quarter like-for-like sales, while in August Asda reported a 4.7% slump in underlying sales for its first quarter. Tesco will update on its second quarter on October 7.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:46:11.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
