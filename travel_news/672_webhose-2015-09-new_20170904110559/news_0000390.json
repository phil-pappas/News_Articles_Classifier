(OTC: NEWL) (\"NewLead\" or the \"Company\") announced today that the Company did not complete the coal supply agreement requiring the Company to supply 720,000 metric tons of thermal coal to a third party buyer, as such agreement was previously announced on January 24, 2013 . The Company terminated the supply contract and did not complete the terms as a result of a decline in coal prices and unfavorable market conditions.\nThe supply agreement was subject to satisfactory completion of a trial shipment that was expected to be executed in the first quarter of 2013, which trial shipment was not completed due to the material collapse of coal prices and adverse market conditions in the coal industry at that time.\nAs referenced in the \"Risks Relating to Our Coal Business\" in the Annual Reports on Form 20-F for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2013 and 2014, the Company stated \"Coal prices are subject to change and a substantial or extended decline in prices could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position, the market prices for coal may be volatile and may depend upon factors beyond our control. Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to sell any of the coal we have sourced under our supply arrangements at favorable prices or at all.\"\nFor further information, please visit the Company's SEC filings at the \"Investor Relations\" section under \"SEC Filings\", http://www.newleadholdings.com/sec.html . The Annual Reports of the Company on Form 20-F can be found at the 'Investor Relations\" section under \"Annual Reports, \" http://www.newleadholdings.com/annual-reports.html \".\nAbout NewLead Holdings Ltd.\nNewLead Holdings Ltd. is an international vertically integrated shipping, logistics and commodity company providing ideal solutions for seaborne transportation of dry bulk commodities and petroleum products through owned and managed vessels.

These statements, as well as words such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"plan,\" and \"expect,\" are intended to be ''forward-looking\" statements. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions and beliefs about future events may vary from actual results and the differences can be material. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, such matters as the creditworthiness of our counterparties, the reliability of reserve reports, our ability to extract or acquire coal to fulfill contracts, the consummation of conditional contracts, future operating or financial results; our liquidity position and cash flows, our ability to borrow additional amounts under our revolving credit facility and, if needed, to obtain waivers from our lenders and restructure our debt, and our ability to continue as a going concern; statements about planned, pending or recent vessel disposals and/or acquisitions, business strategy, future dividend payments and expected capital spending or operating expenses, including dry-docking and insurance costs; statements about trends in the product tanker and dry bulk vessel shipping segments, including charter rates and factors affecting supply and demand; expectations regarding the availability of vessel acquisitions; completion of repairs; length of off-hire; availability of charters; and anticipated developments with respect to any pending litigation. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including without limitation, management's examination of historical operating trends, data contained in our records and other data available from third parties. Although NewLead believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because these assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond our control, NewLead cannot assure you that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or projections described in the forward looking statements. Important factors that, in our view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions, including changes in charter rates and vessel values, failure of a seller to deliver one or more vessels, and other factors discussed in NewLead's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time. NewLead expressly disclaims any obligations or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in NewLead's expectations with respect thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.\nInvestor and Media Relations:\nElisa Gerouki\nNewLead Holdings Ltd.\nTelephone: + 30 213 014 8023\nEmail: egerouki@newleadholdings.com\nLogo- http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150303/179145LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newlead-holdings-ltd-announces-updates-to-previously-disclosed-coal-supply-contract-300150951.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.newleadholdings.com/annual-reports.html", "http://www.newleadholdings.com/sec.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150303/179145LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY15063&Transmission_Id=201509291605PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY15063&DateId=20150929", "http://www.newleadholdings.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newlead-holdings-ltd-announces-updates-to-previously-disclosed-coal-supply-contract-300150951.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150303/179145LOGO"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T03:34:36.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
