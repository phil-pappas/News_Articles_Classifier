Located about 50 miles from Sicily and about 120 miles north of Africa, Gozo is accessible via a 25-minute ferry ride from the shores of Malta.\nSurrounded by cliffs and deep blue seas, and known for its colorful fishing boats, sleepy sunning cats and mild weather year round, Gozo is a welcome respite from the busier pace of Malta and a popular spot for many a filmmaker. The island appears in movies like “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Troy” and “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.” Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie even set up shop on the island for several months while filming Jolie’s movie “By the Sea.”\nA Natural Wonder\nThere are many gorgeous natural phenomenon to see on this jewel of the Mediterranean. Also called the Island of Calypso, Gozo is supposed to be a location in Homer’s “Odyssey.” The nymph Calypso is said to have kept Ulysses as a “prisoner of love” for seven years at Calypso’s Cave, a real spot overlooking the island’s beautiful beach of Ramla. Gazing downward, you can also see the ruins of a fortification built by the Knights of Malta in the mid-18th century.\nOne of the most fantastic sites on the island is the Azure Window. Seen in “The Count of Monte Cristo,” “Clash of the Titans” and Season 1 of “Game of Thrones,” this stone structure is a naturally formed arch that creates a “window” framing the blue sky and stunning blue Mediterranean waters. Hire a local skiff to take you through the window for a view of Gozo from the water and into the Inland Sea, where a shallow saltwater pool has formed.\nMore on this...
