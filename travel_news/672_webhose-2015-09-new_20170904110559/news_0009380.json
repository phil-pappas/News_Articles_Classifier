The event industry sleepover, organised by Mash Media and Olympia London, takes place at Olympia on Thursday 17 September in aid of Macmillian Cancer Trust and Breast Cancer Now. Olympia London is delighted to confirm that top companies including Reed and Easyfairs have sponsored their staff to attend. \nSupport has also flooded in from all corners of the events industry, with many praising the pioneering spirit behind the Sleepover. “What a great way to celebrate women in the industry, raise money for charity and have fun in the process! A wonderful event for a wonderful industry,” says Sallie Coventry, Portfolio Director at IBTM events. “ESSA are happy to support such a unique opportunity for women in the events industry to network, with the added bonus of raising money for some great causes,” comments Andrew Harrison, Director at ESSA. Companies sending staff to the Sleepover can rest assured that the attendees will gain access to some first rate networking opportunities as well as enjoy a varied programme of entertainment. Over cocktails, films, clothes swaps and even a spot of yoga, CEOs, marketing execs and event managers will be able to swap stories and make introductions. Anna Golden, Commercial Director at Olympia London, said: “The sleepover has been created exclusively for women working in events to enjoy an alternative ‘night in’ as well as to make valuable career connections. I’m delighted companies are sponsoring staff to attend and only want to encourage even more to do the same! Our target is simply to raise as much money as possible and to have as much fun in the process on the night. Your help in this is hugely appreciated.” There’s still time to sponsor staff tickets.
