We are studying the needs of Indian consumers and may customise the product to suit their requirements should there be a need,” added Nikhil Ganju, the company’s country manager in India. \n\nAbout 70 per cent of the company’s revenue today comes from advertisements, while the instant booking feature is the company’s second revenue generator. \n\nCommenting on the need to introduce instant booking to its users, Egan remarked: “(It) is a friction-less way for consumers to book (a hotel) in two clicks and it does away with the middleman. \n\n“A lot of hotels in India are highlighting that owning the consumer is important for them as some platforms only provide the names of the consumers, and details such as their emails and physical addresses are not shared.” \n\nTripAdvisor is also looking to roll out this instant booking feature to other Asian countries, especially key markets like China and Japan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:34:18.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
