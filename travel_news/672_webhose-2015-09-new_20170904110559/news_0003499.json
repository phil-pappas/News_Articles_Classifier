Swissôtel Sydney is currently putting the finishing touches to an exciting redesign that has brought new allure to this contemporary hotel, directly opposite the State Theatre, in the heart of the CBD. \nThe striking new look includes the installation of a hand-crafted natural stone panel behind reception in the light-filled lobby, and the addition of 14 sophisticated new Signature Rooms and Suites. The hotel’s further 355 rooms are being completely refurbished with opulent wallpapers, the finest textiles and bespoke contemporary furniture, as part of a multi-million dollar design process that has been taking place over the last eighteen months. Following the design updates by June 2015, Swissôtel Sydney will emerge at the forefront of Sydney’s already impressive hospitality scene. It promises to raise the bar for offering quality and contemporary style within the Australian luxury hotel market. Christian Hirt, General Manager, Swissôtel Sydney: “We are looking forward to further developing on our Vitality Program - we will offer our guests a revitalizing stay with bathrooms in their room or suite stocked with essential oils from our Alpine garden in Switzerland.” “We understand the importance of exceeding the expectations of our guests, with our rooms and suites offering superb comfort reflected in details such as pure linen on the bed, an elegant sense of space and the latest technology.” Realised by renowned Australian interior architecture and design firm, CHADA, the hotel’s contemporary new design has been inspired by the Swiss principles of simplicity and immaculate attention to detail. “The ‘Swissness’ is important”, says CHADA Partner and Creative Director, Juliet Ashworth. “Think precision, sophistication and classical qualities expressed in a modern way. All those qualities play out in the new guestroom design. We wanted to combine the finesse of Swiss design with the glamour of an international city like Sydney. We chose genuine materials with innovative design detailing, and added a residential touch with furniture pieces you would find in a penthouse apartment in a city such as Paris, New York, or Sydney.” For their realisation of Swissôtel Sydney, CHADA’s team incorporated aspects of Sydney into the Swiss-inspired design. Creating a sense of famed Sydney Harbour, the designers have used highly reflective surfaces, splashed with unexpected, vibrant colour and unique furniture features, which include placing the television on a polished chrome artist’s easel. Prioritising individuality for Swissôtel Sydney, the designers have planned the sophisticated new look for all rooms and suites to create the feel of an urban oasis for guests. A particular emphasis has been placed on the hotel’s extensive collection of artwork, with striking pieces forming visual accents throughout the property, referencing to Sydney’s renowned artistic culture. “The guestrooms are quite different from anything else you will find in Sydney. We were not restricted on the use of high quality materials on every wall. It’s like walking into a beautiful, bespoke apartment – very spoiling”, says Juliet Ashworth. Swissôtel Sydney's signature restaurant has also undergone a transformation, under the direction of Thomas Heinrich, Executive Chef, who has recently returned to Sydney after working in leading restaurants in North America. JPB is the hotel's urban eatery and offers a range of locally inspired and seasonally sourced dishes. The chef has developed a passion and aptitude for mixing and matching Australia’s native produce with more traditional flavours. \"We are following the seasons and cooking what tastes best at various moments, we are trying not to mask the tastes of Mother Nature but to enhance what she gives us,\" comments Heinrich. \"With the menus we are sourcing ingredients of the finest quality.\" Swissôtel Sydney is ideally positioned in the centre of Sydney’s business and cultural scene, within metres of the iconic Queen Victoria Building, Westfield Sydney and the historical State Theatre. A ten-minute walk to Sydney Opera House and the lush Botanical Gardens, the 369-room hotel has a breathtaking 360-degree view of Sydney. Swissôtel Sydney’s idyllic Day Spa is the perfect place to recharge after exploring Sydney’s bustling city and offers a wide variety of revitalising treatments. The hotel also offers a state-of-the-art gym, outdoor heated pool and jacuzzi.
