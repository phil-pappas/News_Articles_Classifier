There is no local wine region. There is no city university. There are no grandiose must-see sights. The chef Mario Batali once wrote that Cremona is “famous for its quiet, pious belief in commerce and order.” It’s also famous for something a bit more appealing: music. As I’ve traveled around Italy over the last 25 years speaking grammatically challenged Italian, I’m often asked where I learned the language. When I answer Cremona, where I was a 19-year-old exchange student, the confused, incredulous response is generally: “Cremona? Why Cremona? Of all the cities in Italy?” Before I can answer, the next question is almost always “Do you play the violin?” I do not, in fact, play the violin. But the history of this sleepy city of 70,000 on the Po River, just over an hour south of Milan by train, is inexorably intertwined with violins and other stringed instruments. At a dinner during my first weekend in town, half a lifetime ago, I sat next to a man named Fulvio, who told me he made violins for a living. He’d gone to school at age 13 to learn violin-making and then had apprenticed for years, and now he had his own violin workshop, where he made stringed instruments by hand for musicians and collectors around the world. “This city is the birthplace of Stradivarius,” he said, and explained that there were dozens of luthiers — makers of stringed instruments — just like him working in the city center.

Credit Andrea Wyner for The New York Times Fulvio invited me into his workshop, where over several weeks and months he shaped, carved, chiseled, sanded and varnished very special pieces of wood into instruments that he sold for tens of thousands of dollars. No other place in the world made violins like Cremona, Fulvio said. The Cremonese method — one that dates back to Andrea Amati , “father of the violin” in the 16th century; to the Guarneri family in the 17th and 18th centuries; and of course to Stradivarius — takes longer and is more difficult than other methods, and creates one-of-a-kind instruments. More than 140 liutaio currently ply their trade in the city. Wandering the narrow streets around the Piazza del Comune, you can watch dozens of violinmakers at their workbenches through their storefront windows. If they’re not busy or if they’re in the right mood, some of them may wave you inside to have a look. “This is an antique job. Nothing has changed for centuries,” the violinmaker Philippe Devanneaux, who came to Cremona from Paris 34 years ago, told me during a recent visit. “Of course, you can make a violin with a machine or a computer, but you can’t put your heart inside of it.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story That makes Cremona a must-visit for music lovers. But it’s also a perfect overnight side trip from Milan, especially appealing during the Milan Expo, which runs through October. This fall, in fact, Cremona will be about as buzzing as it will ever get: The 14th Triennale violin-making competition , essentially the Olympics of stringed instruments, takes place Sept. 4 to Oct. 11, overlapping the city’s annual Stradivari Festival. But even those without a passion for stringed instruments can look forward to some of the best food in northern Italy, impressive architecture and a city that’s almost completely off the tourism radar. In her 1954 book “The Surprise of Cremona,” Edith Templeton calls the city a “strange provincial town” (and, oddly, does not mention a word about violins). She recounts a meeting with the editor of the local newspaper who tells her, “There is nothing interesting in Cremona … nothing, nothing, nothing.” Ms. Templeton actually ends up enjoying Cremona, eats wells and enjoys the architecture. “It is a wonderful relief to come to a town where there is no first-class hotel,” she writes. While there are certainly a couple of nice hotels to stay in these days, I couldn’t agree more with the sentiment: Cremona’s virtue lies in how far off the tourist path it remains. Decades after Ms. Templeton’s visit, I’ve found a similar self-deprecating attitude among the Cremonese. Since they don’t like to boast, allow me to: Cremona has one of the most beautiful piazzas in northern Italy. Twelve streets converge on the haunting Piazza del Comune, marked by its majestic 14th-century, 367-foot-tall bell tower, called simply the Torrazzo (for which Cremona’s famed torrone nougat is named). The Gothic palazzi and the Romanesque cathedral cut dramatic shadows against the arcades and the octagonal 12th-century baptistery, an architectural gem. The 268-year-old Teatro Ponchielli (where Mozart once performed) has one of the largest stages in Italy and is still a magnet for international performances. The sprawling markets in the Piazza Stradivari and Piazza Pace are as lively as any in Lombardy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T14:19:16.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
