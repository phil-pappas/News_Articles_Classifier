Yet businesses are failing to respond. Only 8% of consumers around the world feel as though they are actually receiving better offers from companies as a result of sharing their details.\nThis is according to Aimia's latest Global Loyalty Lens report, a major piece of international research surveying more than 20,000 consumers across 11 countries.*\nAn era of openness\nMore than 80% of consumers in the 11 markets studied are willing to share personal information such as their names, email addresses and nationalities with brands. Seventy per cent or more will share their dates of birth, hobbies and occupations.\nConsumers around the world understand the value of their personal information to companies, with 68% globally ranking their data as valuable, and 31% ranking it as highly valuable**. More than half (55%) say they will share their personal information to get better offers and rewards.\nHowever, they are not feeling the benefits.\nBusinesses failing to make their business personal\nBusinesses are not using customer data to personalize and tailor customer experiences effectively. Less than a quarter (23%) of consumers say the communications they receive from businesses are highly relevant to them. ***\n\"This is a golden moment for companies to build meaningful relationships with their customers, but this opportunity will quickly disappear if companies fail to respond appropriately,\" said David Johnston , Group Chief Operating Officer at Aimia. \"Companies need to realize that the power in the Data Exchange Economy rests with the customer. To be successful, companies must think about what they can do for the customer, not to the customer, with each personalized communication, experience and offer.\"\nThe study shows the opportunity is greatest amongst consumers in \"Disruptor\" nations (those countries with quickly accelerating loyalty markets), and with Generation Z and Millennial consumers. These groups are much more inclined to share their data with brands, offering mobile numbers, lifestyle information, email addresses and other critical pieces of information:\nDisruptor nations\nConsumers in the UAE (71%), India (68%) and Brazil (59%) are the most comfortable among all markets with sharing mobile phone numbers. In \"Leader\" nations (more established loyalty markets) just 37% of consumers will share their mobile phone numbers. Consumers in India are the most comfortable among all markets with sharing email addresses (90%), names (89%), and mailing addresses (68%). Consumers in \"Leader\" nations guard their purchase data much more zealously with only 39% willing to share that information compared with 56% in disruptor nations.\nDigital natives\nMillennial and Generation Z consumers are more willing to share their mobile phone number than other generations. For example, in the US, 51% of 18-24 year olds are willing to share their mobile phone numbers, compared to 30% of Baby Boomers. The average across all age groups in the US to share mobile phone numbers is 43%.\nOther key findings\nRead more on the global loyalty market, coupon usage and softening attitudes toward digital wallets.

'Highly relevant' is defined as those who answered 9 or 10 on the scale.\nAbout the research\nThe 2015 Global Loyalty Lens study surveyed more than 20,000 consumers across 11 countries, including Australia , Brazil , Canada , France , Germany , India , Italy , Spain , the United Arab Emirates , United Kingdom and United States . While allowances were made for those markets where the samples were not nationally representative ( India , Brazil , United Arab Emirates ) due to demographic bias in internet penetration, care was taken to ensure the samples in all countries were comparable to previous years so that year-over-year comparisons could be made accurately.\nAbout Aimia\nAimia Inc.
