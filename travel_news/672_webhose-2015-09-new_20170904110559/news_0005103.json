The ‘Superlambanana’ is a famous 17ft tall sculpture located in Liverpool City centre.\nFlybe now operates up to three flights per day between Liverpool and Amsterdam, departing early morning, lunchtime and late afternoon and that offer the opportunity for passengers to make many convenient onward long haul connections available through Amsterdam. Destinations including Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Shanghai are now all accessible from Liverpool via Amsterdam.\nThe airline recently committed to further expansion from Liverpool by announcing a new daily service to Edinburgh which starts at the end of October. It will also be increasing capacity on its existing Isle of Man and Belfast City services with an additional daily departure to both destinations, taking the total number of flights to and from Liverpool by Flybe to approximately 150 per week.\nFlybe’s Chief Commercial Officer, Paul Simmons, said:\n“Flybe is delighted to play a part in making it possible for Liverpool customers to access the world through Amsterdam and, just as importantly, make it easier for the rest of the world to come to Liverpool. We already have a number of codeshare and interline arrangements with long haul carriers that, in the future, have the potential to benefit passengers even further.”\nAndrew Cornish, CEO of Liverpool John Lennon Airport commented:\n“In the past, re-establishing a ‘hub link’ from Liverpool has been the most requested service by stakeholders and passengers across the Liverpool City Region. Both business and leisure passengers are now able to take advantage of the convenience of being able to start their long haul journeys from their home airport, as well as bringing a further boost for the region’s tourism offer and inward investment opportunities.”\nOne way fares on Flybe’s new route to Amsterdam are from £34.99 including taxes and charges and available for booking through to 26th March 2016 at www.flybe.com\nTo further mark the launch of the new route, LJLA has partnered with influential travel bloggers to set a series of challenges in the cultural city of Amsterdam.
