The expanded relationship will help generate incremental rental volume while giving Wyndham Rewards members an even more rewarding rental experience.”\nTo celebrate the expanded partnership, now through the end of the year, Wyndham Rewards members can receive up to 30 percent off all eligible Avis and Budget rentals, plus a bonus of 750 to 1,000 Wyndham Rewards points, depending on their Wyndham Rewards status. Bonus points are in addition to the standard 100 points earned daily.
