In a train. While our understanding of rail development chugs along with aging infrastructure from the last century, high-speed modern trains rocket across other parts of the world. How and why do others develop this rail technology above and beyond our current understanding? What illustrations of this development may inform our own discussions? Welcome on board this new series, “On the Rails.” Community planners and demographers are tracking a transport change afoot: more millenials desire communities with more environmentally-friendly public transport options. This is electrifying new discussions on a development topic our communities have largely ignored in the last decades: modern train networks. The United States once pioneered rail development. But in the last century, trains didn’t develop as a part of America’s culture after the mass production of automobiles, increased flow of cheaper oil and development of the Federal Highway System. Getting on the road became our national pastime. I love the car, the open road, myself. But for the past few years, while based here in Europe, I’m amazed that trains have become my primary mode of transportation: from daily work commutes to weekend trips to longer-distance vacations. It’s unimaginable to many of us Americans. The price tags for such rail networks are undeniably huge, much like the price tags of other infrastructure projects such as the Hoover Dam, Erie Canal, and Eisenhower highway system. As we limp out of the Great Recession, a general consensus has emerged that in our United States, we have neglected transportation infrastructure. The U.S. spends 1.7 percent of GDP on transportation infrastructure, below others such as Canada, at four percent, and China, at nine percent. As we discuss transportation infrastructure projects going forward, might we now be able to re-imagine trains in our own communities? My understanding of passenger trains was once this: 1) from the town where I grew up, you can drive faster to the nearest city than take the local commuter train that was often delayed and 2) from New York City, where I went to work after college as a journalist, you can fly faster home to visit family than take the Amtrak train that was often delayed. Trains in America had deteriorated so much in the last decades, the only people who seemed to talk about them were Jay Leno, Johnny Carson, and David Letterman, as punch lines in monologues. But not so in Europe, where rail investments grew the most on any continent in the last three decades. As I’m criss-crossing from Lisbon to Bucharest, Stockholm to Sicily, I’m understanding the advantages of these trains: less dependence on foreign oil, better air quality, local jobs, community renovation, and productive travel into central locations. Page 2 of 2 - I’m also understanding the disadvantages: massive start-up costs, questionable financial sustainability, land grabs, the necessity of local transport options upon arrival and travel times longer than many flights. All of the above are valid points, and we’ll explore them here in this series, “On the Rails.” But as we have no examples of these modern rail systems in our own communities, nor our own country, to point to as examples, I hope to especially illuminate the quality of life, cultural and social aspects of these rail systems that may seem difficult to grasp from afar. The closest comparison we have is how the Federal Highway System altered America beginning in the 1950s. That system took over thirty years to complete, is the largest public works project in modern history, advanced the latest technology and was a visionary political and public act. Can we Americans muster another project of this size with an advanced rail network? Should we? If we peer across the ocean to observe the stories of a modern rail network, we can conceptualize whether these projects are appropriate for our own society. Consider this space your ticket. Thank your editor for allowing you along on this ride. It takes an enterprising editor to see the value of lifting our heads outside our own borders to understand how an issue can affect our communities, not just in the present, but for the future. I ask only that you not take this ride alone: share these train stories with a young person in your home, or down the street, as they appear here. Because as massive as these infrastructure proposals are, they would take decades to fully implement. It’s the next generations whose lives could be shaped by the train network I’ll be illustrating in “On the Rails.” We owe them at least the opportunity to imagine the possibilities.
