Jeff Miller, R-Fla., would allow the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to spend an additional $625 million on the over-budget Aurora project, but that authority comes with a catch — $200 million of that would be siphoned from awards and bonuses paid to VA employees.\n\"The solution I have introduced will cap VA bonuses, diverting $200 million to fix the mess the department created,\" Miller said in a statement.\nThe idea may seem noncontroversial, especially given Congress' dim view of the agency, but the move threatens to throw a wrench into last-minute negotiations over the Aurora hospital, which is expected to cost at least $1.675 billion — about three times what the VA expected to pay just four years ago.\nAlthough $1 billion has been spent on the project, funding is expected to run dry in the next week. To avoid a shutdown at the site, Congress must approve the new $1.675 billion price tag and allow the VA to shift money from within its own budget to pay for it.\nOn Friday, the Senate agreed unanimously to the new $1.675 billion price tag, but without Miller's stipulation that part of the funding come from VA employee bonuses.\nAdvertisement It's that provision that had Colorado lawmakers wringing their hands to start the week. This is the third time this year that a funding fight for the Aurora hospital has come down to the eleventh hour in Congress.\n\"I'm concerned,\" said U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Aurora. \"I understand what the chairman wants to do. I think he's right, from a policy standpoint. But my position is that we can't have a shutdown.\"\nA construction worker walks through the concourse of the Aurora hospital. ( Denver Post file ) Miller's bill draws criticism from lawmakers who note that the bonuses he targets also goes to VA employees such as doctors who work long hours.\nGiven the impasse — and the short deadline — Miller's move adds a new wrinkle of drama to a project that has seen plenty of it .\nIn a phone interview, Miller said his goal was to bring some measure of fiscal responsibility to the VA.\n\"There is money there (in that coffer), and again there has to be some accountability,\" Miller said.\nHis proposal comes just a few months after it was revealed that a top-level VA official involved in the Aurora project — former construction chief Glenn Haggstrom — was paid about $64,000 in bonuses from 2009 to 2013. Major mismanagement by the VA has been cited as a key reason the cost of the Aurora hospital grew so rapidly.\nOne provision in Miller's bill bars the VA from managing any project expected to cost more than $100 million. The Senate version includes a similar prohibition and would put the Army Corps of Engineers in charge.\nAs of Monday afternoon, it was an open question on what exactly Colorado's delegation would do in response to Miller's move, which was announced late Friday.\nThe VA bill that passed the Senate last week was guided through the upper chamber with the help of Sens. Cory Gardner and Michael Bennet of Colorado — especially Gardner, who had to bring fellow Republicans on board. Making last-minute adjustments to that measure could be difficult.\nAnd it's unclear about how much political clout Colorado's delegation can muster, where the state controls only seven of 435 positions. Adding to the tension: The delegation appeared far from unified Monday night.\n\"There is a lot going on behind the scenes right now,\" Coffman said. \"This is the first move in a negotiation. I don't see it as final.\"\nCoffman, who sits on the House veterans committee, said Miller decided to introduce the bill in spite of his reservations.\n\"He went forward certainly without me,\" Coffman said in an interview Monday morning.\nLater in the day, however, his office asked to clarify his statement and make note that Coffman supported Miller.\n\"No doubt, I strongly believe that the House approach is right, but my guess is that there will be a compromise that lands somewhere between the House and Senate versions,\" Coffman said in a statement.\nU.S. Rep. Doug Lam born, R-Colorado Springs, also sits on the House veterans committee; his office did not respond with comment on his reaction.\nOne possibility raised by congressional aides is that the Democrats in the House delegation — Diana DeGette, Ed Perlmutter and Jared Polis — could marshal opposition to Miller's bill by focusing on the fact it targets federal employees, a key constituency of influential Democrats such as Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland.\nBut that approach also was up in the air by mid-afternoon Monday.\nMark K.
