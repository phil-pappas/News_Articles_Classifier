I'd find it hard to argue with him. The Byzantine cistern is the largest in Istanbul, and was built by Justinian some time after 532 in Sultanahmet Square near the Topkapi Palace, which drew water from it. \nThe Cistern got dramatic lighting and walkways in the 1990s, and it's quite an interesting place to stroll, especially in the off season when it's not crammed with tourists. \nIt takes at least a half hour to see the Basilica Cistern. There is a cafe inside near the entrance. \nEnjoy our Basilica Cistern pictures. Click each thumbnail picture to see the picture full size.
