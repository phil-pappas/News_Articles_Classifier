Overweight staff, the regulation said, \"shall be examined and investigated,\" with crew given three months' notice to lose weight, or risk being deemed temporarily \"unfit\" for in-flight work and grounded for 3 months before being re-assessed. \nLast year, Air India warned about 600 cabin crew last year that they needed to lose weight, and now, according to a BBC report citing an airline official, 125 of those staff have not been able to reach the target range. \nThe official told the BBC that it was concerned unfit staff wouldn't be able to handle emergency situations as efficiently. \nAn Air India spokesperson could not be reached by CNBC by press time. This airline is going to start weighing passengers \nOther airlines have introduced physical requirements for its recruits, with many being criticized for restrictive qualifications. Qatar Airways last year defended policies which didn't allow female staff to be being married or pregnant, according to Reuters. Others, like Czech Airlines provide BMI ranges and want applicants to be able to swim a minimum of 100 meters. \nBut Air India was enforcing similar rules long before the aviation authority issued its own guidelines. The airline faced controversy after having fired a number of stewardesses deemed overweight in 2008, but was subsequently forced to rehire three of those employees last April following a high court ruling, according to reports. \nHowever, that's not the end of Air India's contentious employment policies. According to a June 2015 job ad, Air India's subsidiary and regional carrier Alliance Air said it was looking for \"unmarried\" cabin crew with a \"with clear complexion without any noticeable blemish, no odd scars (or) birth mark or bad case of acne and no visible tattoo(s).\" \nThey also said recruits should have \"even and regular teeth,\" and should speak without a lisp.
