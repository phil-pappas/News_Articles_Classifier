In 2014 alone, 1,405 were given refuge.\nTwo years ago, Brazil streamlined the process of taking in such refugees under a program originally set to end this month.\nAttorney General Beto Vasconcelos, Quote: d in local media, reportedly said the government is considering extending the measure.\nRousseff also referenced the photo of a lifeless little Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach that went viral last week and has since become a symbol of the migrant crisis.\n“The image of the child, Aylan Kurdi, barely three years old, touched us all, and presented the world with a great challenge,” she said.\nEuropean leaders are scrambling as bloody conflicts not only in Syria but also in Iraq and beyond send hundreds of thousands on dangerous treks through the Balkans and across the Mediterranean to the 28-nation EU.\nOn Monday, Britain and France joined Germany in pledging to take in tens of thousands.\nEditor’s note: An online petition was recently launched to urge Costa Rican authorities to take an active role in helping resolve the Middle Eastern and African refugee crisis.
