The company was started in 1980 by one of the founders of the NBA's Sacramento Kings, hence the former name Sky King . Songbird was found \"fit, willing and able\" in October 2014 by the U.S. Department of Transportation to conduct supplement charter operations both domestically and internationally with up to ten aircraft. Following the change in ownership, the company rebranded itself as Songbird Airways.\nSongbird operates a single 150-seat Boeing 737-400 passenger aircraft, and recently agreed to acquire a 230-seat Boeing 767-200ER. Songbird has seen a steady increase in business flying charters for casinos, sports teams, tour operators and to Cuba . \"As soon as we decided to add the 767 we started receiving a significant number of offers to buy the airline from parties interested in flying everything from charters to scheduled service with a variety of aircraft types,\" commented Frank Visconti , Songbird's President & CEO. \"We are analyzing a number of these offers to determine what is in the best interest of our employees and shareholders and will likely decide whether to divest, merge or stay the course over the next 30 days.\"\nSongbird Airways is headquartered in Coral Gables, Florida , and has 32 employees.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150922/269253LOGO\n releases/songbird-airways-considering-sale-300147242.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150922/269253LOGO", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150922/269253LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=FL08469&Transmission_Id=201509221350PR_NEWS_USPR_____FL08469&DateId=20150922", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/songbird-airways-considering-sale-300147242.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T22:12:18.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
