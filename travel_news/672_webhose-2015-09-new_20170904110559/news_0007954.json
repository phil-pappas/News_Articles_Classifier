This has been achieved through the winning of a series of significant contracts in this region of the world, which enjoys very strong growth in air traffic. \n• In conjunction with Chinese partners, ADPI has won the international competition for the master plan and the architecture of the first terminal of the new airport in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, in China. \nThe competition was won in the face of prestigious competitors, including a large number of first-rate international agencies. \n• In partnership with the local branch of global engineering specialists, Meinhardt, ADPI has won two calls for tender issued by Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) for the design of: ◦ an extension to the main terminal (Terminal 1) allowing an increase in capacity of 10 million passengers. This involves primarily expanding the terminal’s landside area in order to enhance the check-in and baggage-handling facilities, as well as passenger flows; \n◦ an extension of the aprons to provide parking space for 24 additional widebody aircraft. \nA major hub in Asia, Hong Kong International Airport welcomed 64 million passengers in 2014 and holds first place worldwide for air cargo. The airport is internationally renowned for its quality of service and its environmental performance. \nFor both of these projects, the ADPI teams are providing their clients with their know-how regarding planning and studies of airport systems and specific airport equipment, all while faced with the challenge of carrying out the project without disrupting daily traffic (construction while in operation). \n• ADPI has been selected, by the Chinese authorities and one of the main local design institutes, to audit the future development projects at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. \nAgainst this background, ADPI provided a high value-added service allowing them to validate the developments planned by the authorities, to identify and develop possible functional improvements in order to optimise airport operations and generate productivity gains. \nThis new contract illustrates the quality of the relationship between ADPI and Shanghai Pudong Airport. The airport had already previously chosen Aéroports de Paris at the end of the 1990s, for the preparation of the Master Plan and to carry out studies on the first terminal. \n• Lastly, ADPI has recently been selected to conduct upstream studies on two provincial airports in South Korea: ◦ the first study aims to verify the feasibility of the expansion of Jeju International Airport (the country's third-largest airport with 23 million passengers in 2014) in order to determine the critical parameters, particularly in terms of the capacity of existing aeronautical facilities; \n◦ the second study, currently undertaken in consortium with the Korean Transport Institute (KOTI), examines the feasibility study for a new airport in Youngnam, a region in the south-east of the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-15T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T00:01:00.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
