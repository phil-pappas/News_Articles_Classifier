Clarion Corporation of America announced today that two-time Formula Drift Champion Chris Forsberg and his Chris Forsberg Racing team have teamed up with Clarion as a Gold level partner for the Clarion Builds program. Forsberg is awarded the \"Official Driver\" title for the program's exciting 1991 Acura NSX custom build and restoration and is tasked with rigorously testing the NSX's capabilities upon the completion of the build. Forsberg will also be ensuring that the car delivers peak performance during the project and that the goals set for the car's overall driving dynamic are achieved.\n\"Our team had a lot of fun with Clarion Builds' BMW 2002 project, so when Clarion asked if I'd be interested in serving as the official driver again for the NSX project, I was thrilled to be part of this new adventure,\" said Chris Forsberg , Two-Time Formula Drift Champion and President of Chris Forsberg Racing. \"The NSX was a poster car for many of us growing up and with the plans that have been laid out for this iconic car by Clarion and the Clarion Builds partners, this build will easily be one of the most unique and technologically advanced NSXs out there, and I can't wait to drive it!\"\nFollowing the format of the inaugural Clarion Builds project featuring the complete restoration of an iconic 1974 BMW 2002, Clarion and its key partners for the NSX project, including Chris Forsberg Racing, aim to unite fans and fully integrate them as a part of the program through both social and traditional media engagements. Additionally, Clarion and its partners will work collaboratively to provide a great deal of detailed content designed to generate excitement and encourage fan participation as the NSX progresses through various stages of the build process.\n\"Super cars are designed with a purpose and it takes truly experienced drivers to squeeze every last drop of performance out of them,\" said Allen H. Gharapetian , Vice President of Marketing and Product Planning for Clarion Corporation of America and Chief of the Clarion Builds Program. \"When we took on the first Clarion Builds project, we didn't build a super car, but instead a tastefully modified iconic classic that we knew could hold its own on the track. Working with Chris on that project was ideal as he was able to really put the BMW 2002 through its paces and show fans of the program, as well as the press, what a brilliant car Clarion and its Clarion Builds partners collectively built. So, we are very excited to have Chris join us as our official driver and welcome Chris Forsberg Racing as a Gold Level partner of the NSX project. I know that our team and our fans are definitely looking forward to getting him behind the wheel of what we believe will be one of the most unique and fun to drive NSXs ever built.\"\nMedia Assets:\nPhoto Galleries of the Acura NSX build progress: http://bit.ly/1MxjEfk\nVideo Unveiling of the Acura NSX: https://youtu.be/231B26cHyj0\nVideo of Dyno Pull Pre -build: https://youtu.be/smlH6WwdqTU\nVideo of drivetrain being removed: https://youtu.be/5kPOdpJMVy4\nTo learn out more about the program, or to follow the complete build, visit Clarion Builds at www.clarionbuilds.com , watch the latest Clarion Builds video at www.youtube.com/clarionUS or follow Clarion on Facebook at www.facebook.com/ClarionUSAOnline\nLike Clarion on Facebook: www.facebook.com/ClarionUSAOnline\nFollow Clarion on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ClarionUSA\nFollow Clarion on Instagram at https://instagram.com/clarionusa/\nFor info about Clarion, please visit: http://www.clarion.com/us/en/corp/about-clarion/index.html\nAbout Chris Forsberg :\nAn American self-taught drifting driver from Doylestown, Pennsylvania , Chris Forsberg is a two-time champion of the Formula Drift series.
