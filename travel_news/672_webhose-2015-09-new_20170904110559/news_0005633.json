Rocketrip and Virgin will announce additional campaigns and perks throughout 2015. \n\n\n“Virgin America was created with the intention of making flying good again and to improve the overall traveler experience in the U.S skies. We are delighted to be partnering with Rocketrip to offer more utility to business travelers and to be associated with a brand that is approaching loyalty in an innovative way,” said Sylvie Charbonnier, Head of Partnerships for Virgin America. \n\n“Our mission is to make travel rewarding for our users, and the data shows that they love flying on Virgin America,” said Emily Hurd, Rocketrip’s VP of Business Development and Marketing. “We’re excited to work with Virgin America to put more money and frequent flyer points back into the pockets of road warriors and treat them to enhanced travel experiences.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T17:42:14.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
