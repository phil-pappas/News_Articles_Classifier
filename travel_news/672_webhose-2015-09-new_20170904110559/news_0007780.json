It hit him on the head, seriously injuring him. \nHe was transported to hospital after the accident. \nAirport spokesperson Mathieu Claise said that the young pilot should have known not to leave the plane before the propeller was at a complete stop, CBC reported. \nHe said he cannot explain why the pilot walked in front of the plane. \nAviation officials are investigating the incident.
