Three people were sent to area hospitals, and the Sandy Springs Police Department warned that lane closures—which include all northbound lanes of 400 and some of 285's eastbound ones—could last through this evening's rush hour. The accident, which involved a Publix truck and a tanker containing 8,000 gallons of fuel, took place shortly before noon. Despite initial reports that the gasoline had leaked all over the highway, the police department issued an email statement that said, \"Sandy Springs Fire Rescue has confirmed that the fuel has been contained, and there is no leak.\" The AJC has pictures. (An Oregon man should've been smushed by two semis—but he lived to tell the story.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T08:09:53.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
