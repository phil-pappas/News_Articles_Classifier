Surrounded by a barrier reef, the resort claims its unique perch \"was once used as a mooring for the famous pirate Blackbeard\" and that hidden treasures (surely) remain buried somewhere on the tiny rock.\nBut you don't need to be a treasure hunter to enjoy everything the Villa has to offer. HiConsumption notes that the resort, which offers only eight private suites, offers \"infinity pool complete with bar, private white sand beach for lounging, and of course the opportunity to dive with PADI certified instructors.\"\nDon't worry, you're not totally stuck there: Villa staff are happy to take ferry you to the outside world. \"Our staff will be happy to ferry you to Bonacca Town, take you on a hike to one of the waterfalls on Guanaja, or to enjoy some good German beer at Manati Bar & Restaurant on the 'cay next door,'\" the resort says . \"They can also assist with arrangements should you wish to hire a guide to take you fishing, sea kayaking, rappelling or bird watching.\" Fancy!\nIf you're looking for sand, sun, and swelling ocean views with as much isolation as possible, the Villa may be right up your alley. You may want to start saving now, though: 7-night packages start at $1,952 per person.", "external_links": ["http://dunbarrock.com/about-us/", "http://dunbarrock.com/packages/", "http://dunbarrock.com/", "http://dunbarrock.com/the-villa/", "http://hiconsumption.com/2015/09/villa-on-dunbar-rock/"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T21:41:18.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
