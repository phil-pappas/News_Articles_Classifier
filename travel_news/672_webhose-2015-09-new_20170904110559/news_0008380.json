Dominic Alves via Creative Commons Licence When Brighton celebrates Burning the Clocks for the winter solstice, it's a lot more than just another northern fire festival. \nFor more than two decades, people of all ages have been lighting up the longest night of the year by parading through town with homemade lanterns and taking part in a huge fiery event on Brighton Beach. \nSo if it's not just another fire festival, what's it all about. \nIt all began in 1993 when a group of local people, fed up with the commercialization of the Christmas season, wanted to create an alternative way to celebrate the holiday season. Their idea was to start a free, creative and inclusive event for everyone, \"regardless of faith creed.\" \nToday, at least 2,000 people take part in the parade and more than 20,000 locals and visitors line the route to watch the event, produced by Same Sky - a community art charity - and the handiwork of thousands of ordinary people. Welcoming the light \nAfter the winter solstice, the days begin to get longer at last. The tradition of scaring away the darkness and encouraging the sun to come back - with fire, with noise, and probably with plenty of drinking - dates from well before Viking times and has its variations all across Northern Europe. Brighton adds its own creative spin, sending off the old year and welcoming the new with with a big family participation event. \nEvents for the December 21 celebration actually kick off about a month ahead of time with lantern making workshops. Lantern kits, of paper and willow, go on sale around Brighton from the end of November. Organizers stress that, for safety reasons, participants should not bring Chinese lanterns or their own, homemade efforts. Only approved lanterns are allowed on the beach. \nThen, at 6:30pm on the night, festivities include: A Themed Lantern Parade - Participants gather on New Street. The theme, set by a local artist, is meant to inspire the lantern makers, dancers and other parade participants. In 2007, Tower of Babel was the theme. The Deep was the 2013 theme and in 2014 The City - Urbano set the tone, At the time of this writing, the 2015 theme had not yet been set. A Procession - The parade processes through Brighton, along North Street, Ship Street, Bartholomews, Eas Street and Madeira Drive. Best viewing is along Madeira Drive. Fire - Particpants add their lanterns to a huge bonfire on Brighton Beach. Fireworks and music - At the climax of the evening, a huge paper and willow sculpture is set fire on the beach as part of a fire show. This is followed by live music and spectacular fireworks over the English Channel. \nAdmission to this event is free . Plan on dressing up in warm clothes (you will be on the beach in December, remember) and arriving early enough to get a good spot on Brighton's lower promenade.
