Pictured is the garden of 2014 People's Choice winners Ray and Penny Ericson during the Waiheke Island Garden Safari. \nOrganisers of three popular Waiheke Island events are joining forces to promote the month of November to visitors. \nThe Waiheke Island Garden Safari, Waiheke Walking Festival and Waiheke Literary Festival are marketing themselves under the umbrella brand – NOW – November on Waiheke. \nCelebrating its 15th year, the Waiheke Island Garden Safari is the major annual fundraiser for the Jassy Dean Trust, which helps sick children and their families on the island. \nThe self-drive safari tour on November 7 and 8 will feature 13 gardens not usually open to the public and will also feature a separate Sundowner garden event, a two-day Massive Plant Sale, and a Waiheke Art in the Garden preview and art auction. All proceeds will go the trust. \nThe Waiheke Walking Festival runs from November 14 to 22 and offers 45 walks of different lengths and challenges. A five day, fully guided walk around the entire 100km Te Ara Hura walkway is being billed as the highlight. \nThere are walks for people who want a shorter, but still spectacular, tramp. And the festival includes walks across land not normally open to the public as well as themed walks taking in wine, olives, history and even meditation. \nMeanwhile, the Waiheke Literary Festival, from November 13 to 15, offers more than 30 free and ticketed events with author sessions of several genres. There are also special events for children. \nFestival highlights are being promoted as a literary lunch with award winning journalist and satirist Steve Braunias and sculptor Peter Lange at Cable Bay Vineyards, and the reading of a new work, Matthew, Mark, Luke and Joanne , by popular New Zealand playwright Karl Nixon. \nWaiheke Island Garden Safari co-ordinator Michelle Barber says NOW is the perfect time to organise pre-Christmas get-togethers or grab a group of like-minded friends to enjoy a spring weekend break. \n\"Whether you'd prefer to visit some of the island's most creative gardens, explore lesser- known walking trails, or delve into the prose and poetry of the literary festival, there's an opportunity for you to discover more on Waiheke Island this November.\" \nVisit waihekegardensafari.co.nz , waihekewalkingfestival.org and waihekeliteraryfestival.co.nz to find out more about the individual events. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T23:59:02.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
