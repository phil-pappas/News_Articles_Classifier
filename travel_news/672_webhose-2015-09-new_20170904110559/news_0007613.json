Perhaps automatic air compression would fit half your wardrobe into a carry-on, or we'd be teleporting around. At the very least, time could have brought us wise, practical robots to pack on our behalf. Here, we've put together our best packing tips and travel tech to help you get your suitcase organized like a pro, no sitting on it required. Step 1: Do the Prep Work (Photo: https://www.flickr.com/photos/grandvelasrivieramaya/3179390917/)\nFirst, figure out what you need to bring based on a few factors: the weather at your destination, what activities you plan to participate in, how long you feel comfortable using the same pair of underwear (correct answer: one day). If you are into getting organized, now is your time to shine: start making a list that includes the most necessary items as well as a few possible contingencies, so if you're headed to Miami , you may want to pack a small poncho, but can skip the parka. Helpfully, a number of apps and websites make it easier. PackPoint (Free) will factor in the weather, your gender, your planned activities, and your length of stay and give you a thorough list of suggested items that you can check off as you pack. Packing Pro ($2.99) has an enormous catalogue of items, plus features like making lists inside of lists for the true Type As of the world. Step 2: Gather Supplies (Photo: https://www.flickr.com/photos/jepoirrier/485366022)\nThe Suitcase : There are two debates you'll need to take a side on first: carry-on vs checked bag, and structured bag vs duffle. For the former, carry-on is almost always the pro way to go: there's less chance of your stuff getting lost, you don't have to wait to drop off the bag at check in or pick it up when you arrive, and you've got a built-in footrest for those long hours waiting at the gate. In the hard vs soft bag debate, this comes down to a more personal choice: the hard bag holds up better to wear and tear and keeps your stuff better protected, whereas the softer bag can fit into tighter spaces, weighs less, and is less likely to get called out for a gate check. Either way, make sure the bag has wheels and adheres to the latest size restrictions. \nThe Bags : A packing pro uses lots (and lots) of smaller bags to stay organized and keep things clean. You'll need: small plastic bags to wrap around shoes, trash bags for the top and bottom of your suitcase (more on this later), dry cleaner bags to put easily-wrinkled items in, and plenty of large ziplocs. If you're really, really cool, we'd also recommend getting some compression compartment bags like these at Flight 001 or these at Eagle Creek . \nThe Clothes : Go back to your packing list and start pulling out all the clothing items on it and stack them in piles by type (shirts, pants, shoes, etc). Contemplate those piles for a while. Now take out half of what you've got (seriously). Start with anything with a hard-to-match print; all your clothes should be neutrals so you can mix-and-match and create lots of outfits with a few basics. Then take out everything that isn't comfortable (those stilettos might be stylish, but you won't want to wear them if you're sightseeing for hours in New York ). What you should be left with is about one bottom for every three days you'll be gone, and about twice as many tops. Take one neutral nice shoe, one casual walking shoe, and one shoe for the weather (think: flip-flops or snow boots). \nThe Toiletries : Whatever you do, don't opt for a check-in bag just for shampoo. Get some squeezable, easily refillable travel tubes like humangear's GoToobs , or pick up some new travel-size options from the expansive selection at 3floz.com . Miists also has cool packing-friendly (i.e. under 3 fluid ounces and flat) products that won't need to be relegated to a checked bag, and many can come in really handy while traveling: stain remover, sunscreen, and wrinkle releaser, to name a few. \nThe Accessories : With all this editing you've been doing (congrats on taking out that pair of leopard-print pants, by the way -- our sources tell us you won't regret it), now is your time to splurge. Remember how you selected lots of neutral color outfits? Bring back the style by taking along a few colorful scarves, some statement jewelry, and maybe even a hat or two. These items don't take up much space, but can transform an outfit from day to night, or disguise the fact that you've been wearing that same shirt for a few days straight. Step 3: Get Packing (Photo: https://www.flickr.com/photos/highwaysagency/6008275527)\nNow the fun part: fitting everything in. \nFirst : Make sure you stay smelling like a pro by first taking some dryer sheets and stuffing them into a few strategic crevices of your suitcase. This will keep your clothes smelling fresh throughout your trip, especially if you are city-hopping from, say, Chicago to Austin , that will entail stuffing the dirty and clean clothes back into the suitcase several times. \nSecond : Bags, bags and bags! If you've got a lot of easily wrinkled clothing, spread an empty trash bag at the bottom of your suitcase (and one at the top once you are done loading everything in). This will allow the clothes to slide around a bit, rather than settling and creasing -- and it will serve as a great dirty laundry bag at the end of the trip. Pack a few wrinkle-prone items in a dry cleaning bag. Individual shoes go in a plastic bag or shower cap (don't put two in one bag -- you need the shoes flying solo in order to strategically place each one). \nThird : Pack! Fill shoes with socks or other soft, small items and then place them sole-out around the edge of your suitcase. Next, start rolling (not folding) all of your clothes (packing pros swear by this technique to maximize space and minimize wrinkling), placing the heaviest ones at the bottom and then layering up with the lighter garments and items. If you've invested in the compression compartment bags, place your rolled clothing and accessories into these first, and then load your suitcase by putting the heavier packs closest to the wheels. If you are really, seriously wrinkle averse (or just want to impress the TSA when they open your suitcase), you might consider the extreme bundle packing method , which essentially involves layering all your clothes into, well, a bundle. No matter your method, consider wearing your biggest and bulkiest items on the plane to save space. \nFourth : The \"Personal Item.\" One of the keys to good packing is learning to utilize your second bag. If you are taking a risk with a heavy/slightly-oversized carry-on bag that might get gate-checked, make sure you are keeping an extra outfit in your second bag. Other items that should go here include electronics, which you should keep safe and organized with something like these Skooba kits , PB Travel's Grid , or Osprey's rolling organizer (because no one likes spending 15 minutes searching for a charger or untangling earbud cords); any reading material (though we'd recommend skipping Dostoyevsky and bringing an ebook reader instead); your wallet and travel documents, including your ID or passport, your tickets, and your flight schedule; and all of your liquids, placed in a one-quart storage bag (and then double bagged into the gallon size) and stored somewhere easily accessible so you can whip them out as soon as you get to the security line. Other items worth throwing in: a smaller purse (for the ladies) for everyday use, a small tote bag for bringing home souvenirs, and a few light snacks for when your airplane meal inevitably disappoints. \nGogobot's mission is to help people discover great places to eat, stay and play that are perfect for them.
