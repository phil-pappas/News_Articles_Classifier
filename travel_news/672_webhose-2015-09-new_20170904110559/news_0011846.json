In recent months, the London and Midlands-based company, which designs and delivers teambuilding events, motivational learning activities and corporate entertainment, as well as interactive conference content, has received a record number of requests from corporate event planners wishing to organise team bonding events and family fun days. \nKDM Commercial Director Nicky Whyman said: “We are seeing a strong focus on company values. There’s clearly a direct correlation between this more inclusive corporate event format, and a desire amongst companies to retain top talent.” “Whatever their industry sector, companies are reacting to a highly competitive marketplace in recruitment terms, prompting them to invest heavily in their workforces. Our clients are asking for energising and stimulating events that reward loyalty and hard work – and in some cases also acknowledge the importance of family support,” she added. Whyman described a recent confirmation for a major food brand that will invite employees’ children to participate in the creation of a themed mosaic to be displayed in the company’s offices. “There’s a noticeable trend for our clients to hold such events at their company’s office site”, she said. “This reflects a strategy to blur the boundaries between work and home, and to go one step beyond the traditional team-bonding initiatives, creating the opportunity for family friendships to be forged”.
