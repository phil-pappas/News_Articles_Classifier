I was brought up to believe that politics was the art of the possible, but it would appear that lust for loss is the primary sentiment among the reborn old-Labour puritans who brought Corbyn to victory.\nPurity rather than power. Idealistic but inadvisable.\nThen, across the Atlantic, I found myself exposed to the alarming possibility of property mogul Donald Trump becoming the next US president. If Corbyn is way to the left, then Trump is out of sight on the distant right. Should both succeed in leading their countries, that would surely be the end of what has been fondly known as the \"special relationship\" between the UK and the US.\nTrump is the ultimate caricature of the Ugly American — the stinking rich, loud, overbearing figure so many foreigners love to hate. No one knows how much he is worth, but a book he once wrote, The Art of the Deal, made it clear that the way to get mega-rich is by doing deals with other people’s money. Trump also hosts a TV game show called The Celebrity Apprentice, which is about hiring and firing people.\nNot a nice man. As one US columnist put it the other day: \"Trump does a dead-on impersonation of a defensive, insecure, schoolyard bully.\"\nOne would expect ordinary, decent Americans to reject such a figure outright, but he is leading a pack of 15 aspirants competing in the Republican Party primaries to see which one will be its candidate to run against the Democratic Party’s choice — almost certainly Hillary Clinton — in next year’s presidential election.\nFriends assured me when I arrived in the US that he couldn’t possibly become the Republican candidate. He’s too bombastic, too outrageous, they said. He’s just got curiosity value. It can’t last.\nBut that’s what my British friends had told me about Corbyn before Labour’s voting day. So, as one inured to the survivability of our own walking disaster here in SA, I’m sceptical. Trump’s substantial lead in the polls seems to be holding, and, as the New York Times has noted, with such a long list of candidates he could win the primary with only a third of the Republican vote.\nThat, of course, could improve Clinton’s chances of winning the presidency, particularly because I sense that the US feels it is time to have a female president after having broken the colour barrier with Barack Obama. But Clinton has her own problems with a scandal that has yet to reach its climax, about her using her private e-mail for state security matters. So she is vulnerable.\nLet us take note, therefore, that a far-right Republican president of the US is more than an outside possibility. And even if Trump doesn’t win these trial runs to become their candidate, his popularity has affected the other candidates who are trying to compete with his extremism.\nAs New York Times columnist Frank Bruni put it last week: \"Trump warps the whole field of candidates, drawing others into ludicrous spats, yanking them towards stances they might not take so easily, turning the spectacle into a farce.\"\nIn other words, Trump’s lead in the polls is drawing the whole Republican Party ever further to the right. They are all becoming infected by his policies and the apparent public approval of them.\nTrump’s declared policy statements are few but revealing: expel 11-million illegal Latino immigrants in the US, build a wall across the Mexican border to keep others out and make Mexico pay for it; ignore global warming, there’s no such thing and campaigns to slow it are obstructing big business; ignore economic inequality, unfettered big business is the way to go; stop Planned Parenthood nationwide.\nAnd above all, of course, the chorus of condemnation of Obama’s peace-making efforts towards Cuba and Iran. These critics are the inheritors of George Bush’s wars against the \"axis of evil\" and the belief that one can bomb people into accepting the American way of life.\nObama has tried to turn that around by using diplomacy instead of military intervention, but these people despise him as a weakling who is diluting the decisive strength of US military power — even though, as recent history is showing in the Middle East, it is spawning more jihadists than conversions to democracy.\nThen into this maelstrom of right-wing extremism plunged the humanitarian Pope Francis to present his gentle alternatives. Accept the immigrants, he implored: \"All of us who are not Native Americans are fugitives from somewhere else.\"\nThe plight of the poor, he warned, was the greatest threat to global security and, as for global warming, his message was about how to live an open-hearted life and to share a vulnerable planet.\nHe didn’t scold and he didn’t lecture, but he delivered a message that responded to every one of the self-seeking themes the Trump cavalcade espoused.\nWhat effect it had on those Republican campaigners, we do not know. All we know is that Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner, himself a devout Catholic, wept on the White House lawn after hearing the pope speak there.\nHe was apparently overcome by the sound of humility.\nThe next day, Boehner announced his retirement after 24 years as a congressman. He was considered a decent mediator between the nay-saying Republican Congress and the Democratic president. Things are likely to get even rougher in US politics without him.\nBut what troubles me is not only the prospect of a hard-right-wing president in the Trump mould emerging from the November 2016 election, which would itself be bad enough given a US president’s enormous influence on world affairs. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate are under Republican control and would almost certainly remain so after a successful presidential election.\nThat level of total Republican control would also lead to a deeply conservative US Supreme Court, which would be bad for the US and thus for the rest of the democratic world for many years to come.\nThere is also the possibility that such a right-wing lurch by the world’s most powerful country, not beloved by the African National Congress, might thrust South African politics in more of a leftward direction — which is not where we want to go.\nWhat we need is what Trump and his Republican trailers reject. The social democracies of northern Europe are the models to follow.\n• Sparks is a former editor of the Rand Daily Mail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:50:31.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
