Doubles £130-£225 (01524 251224; thetraddock.co.uk ).\nThe Traddock Cary Arms, Devon \nThe lucky pooch who bags one two dog-friendly ground-floor rooms at this small, secluded hotel on Babbacombe Bay can lap up a special ‘dog’s dinner’ in the bar on one night of your stay, perhaps after a frolic in the waves. Hosts Peter and Lana de Savary want the very best for their guests, ‘including your four-legged friends’.
