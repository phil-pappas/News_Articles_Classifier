Starting with the Nexus One in 2010, HTC, Samsung, LG, Motorola, and Asus have all built devices for Google to sell, and Huawei should be joining that list by the end of the month. The original goal was to sell Android devices direct to consumers from a Google web store and in effect do an end-run around the carrier distribution model, a goal made clear in the first press release (\"The company is also launching the first phone offered through this new model, called the Nexus One, which combines the latest in hardware from HTC Corporation with the newest Android software\").Although the appearance was there, the Nexus range has never been about supplying developers or fans with Android reference devices. In my mind a reference device is completely open, has all (or at least the vast majority) of hardware elements that might be built into OEM devices, and is not built to a price that will make it competitive in the retail market.[gallery2012]Nexus devices may include some of the latest technology, but it's rare for a Nexus device to have all of the elements that could feature on a manufacturer's Android device. Last year's Nexus 6 continued the trend of not including microSD card support. While there are arguments on the inclusion or otherwise of removable storage in the consumer market, if Nexus is the reference platform many believe it should be then the inclusion of something as major as microSD should be part of the design.Given that carriers will apply SIM-locks to the device, tweak the firmwares to include splash screens, and lock out certain hardware functions, I'd suggest that the Nexus range is a commercial range of devices, a range that has seen declining sales and a negative impact on Google's revenue in the last year.Where the Nexus devices do win out is mostly in Android support. The hardware tends to be first in line to pick up the latest builds of Android (although carriers can still influence this timescale), and you can be confident that the compatibility of applications in the Google Play store will be close to complete.The other benefit isn't one for the consumer, but for Google. By deciding who gets to manufacture each year's Nexus hardware, Mountain View is in a position to reward manufacturers and play favourites if it ever felt the need to do so. It may have declining sales, but the online interest in the Nexus devices is high, which has a knock-on effect for the manufacturers associated with the hardware.LG and Huawei have reportedly been picked to build two new Nexus devices for 2015. LG has become a strong supporter of Android, with the LG G4 picking up critical acclaim. Huawei is looking to become established outside of its native China, and the association with the Nexus line will help in Western markets.[caption id=\"attachment_13218\" align=\"\" width=\"1024\"] Nexus 6 (image: Google.com)[/caption]There are benefits for Google to continue with its Nexus devices. The handsets have a loyal following, and they appreciate the direct link to Google that the Nexus appears to offer. But in terms of making a difference to the Android ecosystem, what role is there for the Nexus devices?As Android started out in the smartphone world, it was easy to argue that Google needed to show manufacturers and the public what it believed Android was capable of. Arguably that role is now taken on board by the Android One project and the release of 'Pure' firmwares for various manufacturers handsets. Does Google still need to be selling consumer Nexus device?For sales, market share, and demonstrating the purity of the Android platform, I would argue no it does not. For corporate pride, to stand behind the Android software, for the connection with the hardcore fan base, and for the PR boost that the chosen Android manufacturer can gain, the Nexus devices clearly have a role to play.But it's not the role of the all-encompassing 'perfect' Android device.", "external_links": ["http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2405892/google-admits-nexus-6-and-nexus-9-sales-have-been-sluggish", "http://www.cnet.com/news/google-will-hold-nexus-smartphone-event-on-sept-29-in-san-francisco/", "https://investor.google.com/releases/2010/0105.html", "http://www.techmeme.com/150902/p34#a150902p34"], "published": "2015-09-04T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T02:56:39.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
