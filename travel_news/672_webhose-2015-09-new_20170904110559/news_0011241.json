There are no white-sand beaches, palm trees, tropical heat or exposed bodies to be found in this archipelago. I am, in fact, wearing more clothing than I've ever worn before. We're in the Antarctic and I'm in six layers. Antarctica, the continent responsible for the heroic tales of Mawson, Scott and Shackleton, has always been the stuff of my dreams. \nAs a child, I collected stickers from cereal boxes of Antarctic explorers and stuck them to a poster on my bedroom wall. The tales of these intrepid travellers, testing themselves in one of the harshest environments on earth, were an inspiration. \nShackleton was said to have placed an ad in a London paper, calling for volunteers to join his expedition, that simply read, \"Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.\" Whether the ad was real or a myth mattered not to my eight-year-old self. Craig Platt \nCruising among the giant icebergs of Neko Harbour. \nNow, 30 years later, I've finally arrived, in much more comfortable circumstances than Shackleton's men. \nOur expedition, run by One Ocean cruises, is aboard the Russian science vessel Akademik Ioffe. It may lack the salubrious facilities of larger cruise ships, but it has distinct advantages over them, too. \nAntarctica treaty regulations stipulate tourists landing on the Antarctic peninsula or nearby islands must be in groups of 100 or less. We have 90 passengers on board, which means our entire complement can go ashore at once. Craig Platt \nGetting up close with whales. \nPassengers are welcome to enter the bridge at virtually any time to enjoy the ship's best views from indoors. There's also an open top deck, and the bow of the ship is open to passengers, except during rough seas. \nWithout the luxuries of high-end ships, the journey is more affordable, too. The price for this voyage breaks down to less than $970 a day for those staying in the most basic accommodation (triple-share cabin with shared bathrooms). It represents solid value for money when you factor in all the inclusions: food, guides and expeditions, as well as cold weather gear and boots. \nThe ship is an active science vessel. Along with our crew of expedition guides, we have scientists on board who are here to do research, and they share information and findings with passengers, in presentations. Craig Platt \nChinstrap penguins. \nOn board our cruise is Ari Friedlaender , a professor from Oregon State University who specialises in whales. He's here to tag whales that, at this time of year (March), are plentiful. Friedlaender tells us that the underside of a humpback whale's fluke (tail) has a unique pattern, like a fingerprint, and passengers are urged to get as many photos as we can whenever a whale dives, and to share them with his team so they can identify individual animals. Ad Feedback \nOur first stop, after our two-day journey across the Drake Passage from Ushuaia in Argentina, is Fournier Bay, a calm body of water surrounded by ice and snow-covered mountains. Here we get our first close encounter with humpbacks, spotting several families that gently swim around between chunks of floating ice, occasionally diving deep to seek food, showing off their impressive flukes in the process. \nOptions for landing on the continent are limited - much of the peninsula's coastline is glaciated - sheer walls of ice breaking off into the sea, making it impossible to make landfall even during the warmer months. Craig Platt \nGentoo penguins check out the visitors at Cuverville Island. \nLater that day we take zodiacs to land at a penguin colony at Cuverville Island. The beach is crowded with cute little gentoo penguins, one of several species to be found in the region. While we're supposed to keep our distance, the penguins disregard these rules, with many taking the opportunity to take a close look at these strange visitors (and in some cases, peck at our clothes, cameras and backpacks). \nWe also spot a distinctly less cute animal lurking just off shore - a leopard seal. It patrols the water waiting for any penguins to get too close, so it can take the opportunity to pluck one from the beach. \nWhile we quickly settle into a daily routine aboard the Ioffe – meals are communal and served at set times, with a morning and afternoon excursion - the-10 day itinerary packs in a diverse range of experiences. Craig Platt \nEnjoying the view from the Academik Ioffe. \nThere's the spectacular \"iceberg graveyard\" – a small bay crowded with trapped bergs of incredible shapes, sizes and colours. \nWe also stop at Palmer Station, the smallest US base in the Antarctic, where a maximum of 45 people are based in summer. We're given a tour by one of the resident scientists and some insight in to what it's like to actually live down here (conditions are cramped and few stick it out in the dark of winter, but it's clear the locals wouldn't want to be anywhere else). And then there's our morning at Neko Harbour, the one place we can set foot on the continent. We hike to the top of a hill for stunning views across the harbour amid a gloriously warm by local standards – it's minus 2 degrees – and sunny morning. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T04:03:56.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
