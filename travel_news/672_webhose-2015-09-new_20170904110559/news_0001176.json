Tim Tebow: running back.\nWhile playing Madden NFL 16 , I noticed if you change Tebow's position to halfback, he earns a sizable bump in his overall rating.\nMadden uses a scale of 0-100 but typically average players range in the mid-70s. So rather than Tebow being a subpar quarterback with a rating of 68, he becomes a mid-tier running back with a score of 75.\nAt 6-foot-3 and 236 pounds, he would be a big bruising power back. Think Peyton Hillis without the blocking abilty. His 83 strength is ranked near the best among RBs, as is his ball carrier vision (95), which is tied with the likes of Eddie Lacy, DeMarco Murray and Darren Sproles.\nTo test this theory, I needed to sign the free agent to a team. So why not the Broncos? Denver's in need of some depth at the position and Tebow's rating was No. 2 between C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman. But I'm making him the starter, you know, for science. And sorry, Kyle Williams, but we're going to need that No. 15 jersey back.\nTo make it fair, every game was simulated and injuries turned off (I mean, reading about Tebow sitting on the bench after getting hurt after Week 1 would be incredibly dull).\nSo how'd he do?\nRunning behind Denver's inexperienced line, he struggled early in the season, running for less than 4.0 yards per carry in each of his first two games. He finally broke out in Week 4, exploding for 91 yards on the ground and tallying two touchdowns against the Vikings.\nAdvertisement Oh yes, Tebowmania has returned to Denver.\nIt doesn't stop there. Tebow broke 100 yards for the first time against the Raiders' defense in Week 4 and recorded his first TD reception. It was the turning point of the season for him.\nWhatcha goin' do when Tebowmania runs wild on you?!\nThe Broncos finished 12-4 and earned a wild-card berth (KC won the division, in case you were wondering). As for Tebow? The former QB rushed for 1,364 yards and nine TDs. He ran in four TDs in two playoff games before Denver fell to the Bengals. Despite his effort, no postseason awards, but he brought back the art of Tebowing to the Mile High City.\nC'mon, Tim. Running back. Consider it.\nCHEW ON THIS\n• The Broncos won a wild, crazy game against the Kansas City Chiefs Thursday night, NFL reporter Troy Renck writes. Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles took full responsibility for the loss after his fumble, according to The Associated Press.\n• Speaking of which, the game-clinching fumble recovery touchdown by Bradley Roby was insane. Watch it .\n• Peyton Manning was ecstatic after the game. Listen to his post-game speech, it's fantastic.\n• Also watch Von Miller channel his inner Hingle McCringleberry after a sack.\n• In non-Broncos news, Super agent Scott Boras says the Rockies need more veteran pitching , MLB reporter Nick Groke writes. In other news, the sky is blue .\nWATCH THIS\nPop star Ariana Grande is pretty amazing at impersonating other singers. Watch her on \"The Tonight Show\":\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\nHappy 59th birthday to former Quebec Nordiques great Peter Stastny , and father to former Avs star Paul Stastny. Peter was pretty good. You know, 450 goals and 789 assists in his NHL career. No biggie.\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.con/joenguyen", "external_links": ["https://www.easports.com/madden-nfl", "http://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIF1y9QeRHo"], "published": "2015-09-18T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T21:14:19.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
