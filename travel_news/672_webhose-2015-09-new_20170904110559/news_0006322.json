They are harder to detect than ever before and Softonic’s Clean & Safe campaign was launched to help users keep their devices free from malware,” said Gino Micacchi, Softonic’s VP of Product. “Our Clean & Safe initiative means that when users visit Softonic they will only find software that is reassuringly safe to download and install. Together with RiskIQ, we will continue to expand the scope of our security checks, to enable us to react to the ever-changing dynamics and challenges of online security.”\nIn addition to improving malware detection with RiskIQ, Softonic has also launched other initiatives as part of their Clean & Safe campaign. For example, users can now report any problems with products they find in Softonic’s catalog. Those user reports, combined with the automatic monitoring from RiskIQ, will combine to significantly reduce the threat from the constantly evolving landscape of malware.\n“Our proprietary crawling technology has already revolutionized the approach many organisations take to their security, opening up their capabilities to better understand their digital footprint and the malicious content targeting it,” said Elias Manousos, CEO and co-founder of RiskIQ. “By supporting Softonic’s Clean & Safe campaign with these capabilities we’ll be enabling Softonic to continue delivering a trusted service to their customers.”\nSource:-Softonic", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:14:06.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
