Of the 15.1 million total arrivals to Singapore in 2014, Indonesians accounted for over three million arrivals. \n\nAs Indonesian arrivals have softened this year due to the global economic slowdown and regional competition, this campaign is expected to boost interest and maintain last year’s performance, added Koh. \n\nIn its latest campaign for Indonesia, STB has also taken a fresh approach by leveraging the star power of local celebrities. \n\nMichele Wooi, area director Indonesia of STB said: “We are very pleased to have Titi Kamal and Christina Sujiono as our key opinion leaders to inspire Indonesians to enjoy Singapore like they do. Widely known as celebrities who love to travel and explore new experiences with their family and friends, they are well-suited to be the face of our advertising campaign.” \n\nShe added: \"We are very happy to have the support of the travel trade and airline partners who have come together to offer special airfare and attractive travel packages that are themed for family and friends. \n\n\"Indonesians can look forward to an exciting line-up of travel deals that will be featured in our promotions.\" \n\nLasting till March 2016, the campaign will reach audiences through channels such as newspapers, lifestyle and parenting magazines, websites and social media.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T01:45:17.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
