Photographer's Note \nFounded in 1515 under Swedish rule, Helsinki reminded for a long time an unimportant seaside town. In 1812 it became the capital of the Russian grand duchy that Finland was at that time. After the independence of Finland from Russia in 1817 it became the political, economic and cultural center of the new country. With over 620'000 inhabitants it is by far the largest city in this northern country. Together with the neighboring cities of Vantaa and Espoo roughly 20% of Finland's population live in the area. Around 6% fo the population speaks Swedish while Finnish remains the main language. In this picture, taken from the ferry that shuttles back from Helsinki to Soumenlinna fortress island, we can see from left to right: the cathedral, the Uspenski russian orthodox cathedral and the Tallin bound ferry from Viking line. \nikeharel has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T22:34:42.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
