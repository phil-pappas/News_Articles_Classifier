This can result in a controller clearing a flight for departure based on an outdated plan, and the pilots flying a route not anticipated or planned for by the controller.\nAs a consequence, controllers have to review flights plans, call pilots and search through paper print outs tracking a flight's progress to compare prior plans with new data displayed on computers, a statement by the counsel's office said.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed the problem and revived a working group to address the matter. The FAA initially had created a working group to address the problem in 2012.\nBut an audit earlier this year confirms that the group had little impact and problem still remains, the counsel's office said.\nThe controllers who blew the whistle on the problem work at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Romulus, Mich. But the problem affects air traffic nationwide.\n\"The whistleblowers in Detroit deserve our deep gratitude,\" Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said. \"While more work needs to be done, their actions reignited efforts to address the problems.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T19:12:25.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
