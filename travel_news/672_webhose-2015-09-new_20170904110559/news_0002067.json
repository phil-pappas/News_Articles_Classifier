The one-day briefing session is open to all and will provide attendees with insight into all of the new requirements introduced by ISO 9001:2015, plus ‘heads-up’ on the anticipated changes to the aerospace/defence AS9100 series of standards (to be published April 2016). \nDavid Scrimshire, managing director of TEC Transnational, said: “The ISO 9001:2015 standard is scheduled for publication in September this year, with a three-year transition period for companies currently certified. Our interactive session we will provide guidance on upgrading current quality management systems to meet all of the new requirements. “Similarly, the AS9100:2016 series of standards will introduce new topics like human factors, product safety and counterfeit parts, as well as extended requirements for risk management, so it is vital that companies within the aerospace and defence industries understand what is required of them.” Woodland Grange Conference Centre is TEC Transnational’s first choice of venue for all of its public training courses. David Scrimshire said: ”The venue holds ISO9001, ISO14001 and ISO18001 so these accreditations further endorse the strength of courses such as this. The importance of effective quality management systems cannot be under-estimated in terms of a company’s performance and efficiency. “This briefing session will give organisations valuable insight into the significant changes ahead and how they can start now to prepare for them.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T02:42:01.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
