The visit is part of the SMART programme organised by the French office to educate and train travel agents on that market.\nIt involved a one-day intensive destination training with the agents after which they had different modules to complete. Once they had gone through these stages, the agents then had to sell five complete bookings to the destination in order to qualify for the educational tour which is the final leg of their training.\nDuring their recent visit, the 11 agents from different agencies all over France had the chance to discover some of the inner islands of Seychelles namely Mahe, Praslin, La Digue and Silhouette. They also had the chance to visit various hotel products, some of which they are already selling.\nThe trip ended with a ceremony organised at the AVANI Seychelles Barbarons Resort & Spa whereby all the agents received their certificates, qualifying them as Seychelles SMART Agents.\nPresent at the ceremony were the Seychelles Tourism Board’s chief executive Sherin Naiken, Paul Lebon from Mason’s Travel ̶ the destination management company that took care of all the transfers and guided tours for the group.\nAlso partnering on this trip was our national airline Air Seychelles, which sponsored the tickets.\nThe agents were accompanied on the trip by Christine Vel, senior marketing executive from the Seychelles Tourist Office in Paris.
