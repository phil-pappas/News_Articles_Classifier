In a survey, 60% of travelers say they've taken food from their hotel spread. (Mary Forgione / For the Times) By Mary Forgione Travel \nSpend two seconds on social media and you'll see endless tweets about travelers behaving badly. But what do people fess up to doing when they're asked about their naughty ways? \nTravel booking website Hipmunk asked 1,000 of its travelers about the worst things they do when they're on the road. \nFor hotel guests, 60% say they stole food from the breakfast buffet, 37% sneaked an extra guest into their room (without paying), 29% took toiletries from the housecleaning cart and 17% sneaked into a hotel to use the pool. \nAnd 7% -- exclamation points here! -- have gone skinny-dipping in a hotel pool. Really, people? \nOn airplanes, 54% of passengers say they recline their seats, which is fine if you're in first class but not so fine if you're in economy. \nAlso 18% say they get up when the seat belt sign is on, and 6% say they get on the plane before their boarding group is called. \nOthers say they act differently when they're abroad too. Twelve percent say they do drugs in countries where it's legal, and 23% imbibe when they're younger than 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T21:45:54.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
