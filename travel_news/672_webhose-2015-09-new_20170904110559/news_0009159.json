Ideally, we grow people from within but the issue I find with so many places opening up and staff being poached or moving on so quickly, it’s difficult to have them long enough to train them into those positions.” \nHakkasan Middle East & Asia head of wine Olivier Gasselin added that the trend to “overpay” for positions has made it difficult for some operators. “You try to retain your best staff but some people pay over the earth and poach everyone,” he added. \nThe trend isn’t confined to just independent venues or hotels, and experts claimed this was seen across the board. \nThe lack of regulation on wages is also a challenge, experts claimed. \n“There’s always rumours and rumblings on who’s paying what. The biggest knock I see with that is that a lot of people becoming more and more transient with their jobs. They do the opening, realise things are not stable and then are desperately looking for the next thing,” said Utopia group beverage director Angus McGregor. \nThe number of openings in the market has something to do with the increased competition, said Thomas Gillgren, a bars manager at Whissle Group. “When you have an opening every week there are opportunities, and sometimes the grass is greener on the other side, but most of the time it’s not.” \nExperts said the Gulf region is currently struggling to attract a good calibre of talent from the international market, saying Singapore is being viewed as the next hot property at the moment. \nAnother staffing issue highlighted by the roundtable was the seasonality of the industry. In other areas of the world, bar industry hopefuls and seasoned professionals do a few months at a venue in another part of the world. However, due to visa restrictions in this region, it’s not very easy. \nGillgren said seasonal work is becoming more and more of a trend. \nMcGregor claimed “the bureaucracy in that it is still really difficult because there’s no real visa structure in place for seasonal work. Is Dubai set up to cope with this shift?” \nThe panel unanimously agreed that if there was a provision for “seasonal visas” for perhaps October to April every year, it would help the industry tremendously, with the ability of attracting international skills and knowledge sharing. \nThe Caterer Middle East Bar & Nightlife Forum will take place on October 5, 2015 at Grosvenor House, Dubai.
