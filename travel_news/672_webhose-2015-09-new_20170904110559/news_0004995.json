The other successful bidders were Redfern Travel, HRG and Calder Conferences.\nMatt Denham, commercial delivery director at CCS , said: “This shift away from traditional frameworks to separate contracts is an excellent example of how the government is reshaping its commercial approach to deliver savings for taxpayers while making the way government runs more efficient.”\nClarity ditched the Co-operative name earlier this year after the business was purchased from Co-op’s travel agency joint venture with Thomas Cook last year.\nPat McDonagh, Clarity’s CEO, said: “The strict criteria for travel within central government departments will provide a challenge that we are more than ready to meet.\n“The win is a nod towards not just our market-leading systems, but also the infrastructure of our business which is perfectly geared to manage the extensive security elements involved.”\nClarity said it was already putting processes in place to fulfil the contract with plans to start delivering services to the government by the middle of October.\nThe focus will be on increased adoption of online booking tools, more frequent reporting and greater use of video and telephone conferencing.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BBT_online"], "published": "2015-09-18T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T18:02:59.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
