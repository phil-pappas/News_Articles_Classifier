(Photo: Alex Wong, Getty Images)\n59 CONNECT 61 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 6 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Amtrak is cracking down on passengers who try to board their trains with too many bags.\nStarting Oct. 1, passengers who exceed the limit of two carry-on bags and two personal items will have to pay $20 for each bag that is in excess.\nTravelers will also have to pay the fee if a bag is overweight. Carry-on bags cannot exceed 50 pounds, while personal items such as purses and laptops will have to weigh 25 pounds or less.\nAmtrak spokesman Marc Magliari says the decision to impose the fee came after conductors on routes that run only a few times a week complained that they had to decide whether to turn away people with too many bags.\n\"People will show up with an excessive amount of baggage, and the crews have to make the choice: Should we let them ride with more or turn them back,\" he says. \"It puts the crews in a pretty bad position.\"\nThere were also safety concerns with the overweight bags.\n\"It's unsafe for the crew,\" he says. \"For a passenger, imagine you're sitting under the luggage rack and someone is trying to wrestle a 75-pound bag up to the rack over you. That's not good for anyone.\"\nBaggage fees are not new to the travel industry. Most U.S. airlines have been charging fees for checked bags for years. Only Southwest Airlines lets passengers check two bags for free. JetBlue Airways, which had long touted its one free checked bag policy, began charging for checked bags this summer.\nAllegiant, Frontier and Spirit, meanwhile, charge for carry-on bags that are too big to fit under the seat in front of you.\nLast year, airlines made $3.5 billion in baggage fees, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nUSA TODAY\nJetBlue details new bag fees, which begin Tuesday\nBut Amtrak is not doing this for the money, Magliari says.\n\"The majority of our passengers won't even notice this because they're not even approaching the limits for carry-on bags,\" he says.\nHe also points out that Amtrak is not changing any of its baggage allowances, while airlines over the years have reduced the number of bags people can check for free. In addition to the four bags permitted on board, Amtrak also allows passengers on certain routes and trains to check two bags for free.\nAnd passengers traveling with infants under the age of two can carry an additional item such as a stroller or diaper bag that does not count towards the allowance.\n\"One person could be traveling with 250 pounds of checked and carry-on baggage plus an infant plus a bag to take care of that infant,\" he says. \"So I don't think that anybody has as friendly a baggage policy.\"\nDon't expect to have Amtrak employees weighing all bags or forcing passengers to place them in luggage sizers of the kind you see at airports.\n\"If people are carrying six bags of carry-ons, that's easily observed,\" he says. \"We'll intercept that passenger and check what their situation is.\"\n59 CONNECT 61 TWEET 2 LINKEDIN 6 //usat.ly/1FElGdc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6bb4767f95245a4d15857a7dc064debb7d4fcb4b/c=0-191-4631-2807&r=x633&c=1600x630/local/-/media/2015/06/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635712519288851590-AP-Airline-Travel.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fbd5f401fbfab3caafe2a765dd6b168bd881931f/c=188-0-2992-2108&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792082010313049-GTY-486372706.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FElGdc&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1FElGdc&text=Amtrak%20adding%20bag%20fee%20for%20excess%20or%20overweight%20luggage&via=usatoday", "http://usat.ly/1FElGdc", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4affce369fcaae2b68bbdd59cb9bea8435896b9d/r=500x351/local/-/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792082010313049-GTY-486372706.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/USATODAY/USATODAY/635792082010313049-GTY-486372706.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:33:00.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
