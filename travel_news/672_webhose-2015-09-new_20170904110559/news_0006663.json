Universal's haunted houses are ghosts of HHN past – in a good way \nHalloween Horror Nights is like going to a Universal High School reunion this year. Everything is kind of familiar, if twisted, ugly at times, full of screams and bad dreams. It can be bloody terrifying — and good, clean fun. And there's talk of the good ol' days. \nThis year's event is the 25th one for Universal Orlando, which took old themes and smashed them into new ones while reviving key characters throughout the theme park. \nOne prime example is Jack Presents 25 Years of Monsters and Mayhem, one of the record-high nine haunted houses. Visitors first see an entrance emblazoned with a bright, giant version of Jack the Clown's head, flanked by posters of icons of past years, such as the Director, the Storyteller and even young Cindy.

(Universal Orlando) Caption Halloween Horror Nights 25 Matt Mauney, Orlando Sentinel See more galleries \nInside the winding way of this house —the longest in HHN history — are dozens of nightmarish characters from the past. We walked by Pumpkinheads, vicious bears, Frankenstein and friends plus scary clowns, including multiple incarnations of Jack. Although I've been to less than half of the Horror Nights, it was a stroll down memory lane. \nYou might consider Jack Presents as a \"greatest hits\" package, but it also could be a strong introduction for HHN newbies. They wouldn't be distracted by trying to follow a storyline from a horror movie or the backstory of one of Universal's original tales. The house has a top-notch professional look, strong special effects and an army of scareactors lurking and lurching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T00:33:02.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
