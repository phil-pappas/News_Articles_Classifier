As Pure Hospitality retires its legacy debt, the Company expects to more rapidly clean the balance sheets and greatly minimize the number of note holders. The Company also anticipates this change being reflected on the 3rd quarter financial filings.”\nMr. Pereira is certainly keeping to that promise!\nSo, management suggests that shareholders seriously prepare themselves for a very promising beta test launch of Oveedia, taking comfort in knowing that Pure Hospitality Solutions is are doing everything possible to assure every investor that PURE’s success reflects where it matters most.\\\nAbout Pure Hospitality Solutions, Inc.\nPURE provides proprietary technology, marketing solutions and branding services to hotel operators and condominium owners.
