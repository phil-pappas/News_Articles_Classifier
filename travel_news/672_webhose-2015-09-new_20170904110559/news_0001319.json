As number of tourists increase year by year, the number of rooms to accommodate them must also increase,” Kazim said. \nBetween January and July this year, 11 new properties opened in Dubai, adding more than 2,600 rooms in the city. At the end of July, total rooms stood just shy of 95,000. \n“We are continuously working with all the stakeholders to ensure that Dubai’s inventory increase is well aligned and proportionate to our tourism sector,” he said. \nDespite the global macroeconomic conditions, he said that Dubai’s key performance remains relatively stable in the first seven months of this year. \nWith occupied room nights increased by seven percent year-on-year to an excess of 15 million, the average occupancy rates between January and July stood at 77 percent while the average daily rate stood at Dh585, RevPar (revenue per available room) at Dh450. \nDubai’s cruise industry has also contributed to the growth, he said and added that the 2014-2015 cruise season saw an overall increase of 15 per cent in ship calls and 42 per cent increase in cruise tourists. \n“The new season is expected to perform even better. Looking ahead, we remain very focused on ensuring Dubai stays an attractive market for hoteliers and investors in the hospitality and tourism industry,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T00:35:28.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
