Wanderlust Storytellers , is an increasingly popular family focused travel blog with the mission to inspire and entice families to travel and experience the world, and enjoy those kinds of benefits. Recently, Wanderlust Storytellers announced they have joined forces with Make-A-Wish Australia to fundraise for a child battling a life-threatening illness to have their most cherished wish come true; to go on a dream trip away with their family. The early response to our support of this great organisation has been very enthusiastic.\n“Travel is one way that a family can enjoy quality time together, build stronger bonds with each other and create a lovely bank of memories,” commented Jolene co-founder of the blog. “Together you can embark on the greatest educational adventure. You can explore the world and create stories for generations to come. Through our stories, tips and recommendations found on our blog, we would like to inspire you to chase your dreams and to believe that anything is possible.”\nAccording to the Wanderlust Storytellers, in addition to doing their best to encourage their readers to travel, the blog also informs readers of up-to-date travel trends, recommends travel destinations and reviews and suggests quality travel related products.\nMake-A-Wish is well known for giving really sick kids and teenagers hope for the future, strength to face the challenges of their illness, and joy from their incredible wish experience. Make-A-Wish wishes, such as this one to travel, are vital, build resilience and are an essential complement to medical treatment. With their vision being one that's naturally synergistic with Wanderlust Storytellers the joint effort to fundraise made very good sense to the blog owners, who view travel as a vital part of a happy life.\nFeedback for the blog's work has been overwhelmingly positive.\nA business owner from Monticchiello, a city recently reviewed by Wanderlust Travel, recently remarked, “Ciao Jolene I’m Francesco (owner of Guardiola and the B & B La Casa di Adelina) I write you from Monticchiello. I am a true resident of Monticchiello. 'Un vero Monticchiellese'. I want to thank you for the wonderful article that you published about my country. If you decide to return to Val d’Orcia advise me that I will be happy to meet you.”\nFor more information about Wanderlust Stoytellers and how to help their fundraising efforts be sure to visit http://www.wanderluststorytellers.com.au and follow them on Facebook for regular updates.\nAbout Company:\nTravel Blog, specialities Family and Parent-Escape travel.
