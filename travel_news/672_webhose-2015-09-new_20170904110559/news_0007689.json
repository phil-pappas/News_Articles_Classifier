Earlier this year my husband and I had a really enjoyable cruise on the Queen of the Mississippi, taking a week to float gently down river from Memphis to New Orleans. On the voyage we were taken to view many sights relevant to that history, including Vicksburg, which we found very informative. Previously our whole knowledge of that time was through Gone with the Wind. The battlefield site is still laid out as it was during that conflict and our guide explained the fighting extremely well. Also to be seen is the wreck of the Civil War gunship, the Cairo, which was raised and preserved, much like our Mary Rose. It was fascinating and the visitor’s centre well presented. As Brits, we didn’t find the situation at all intimidating, in contrast to our experiences in Boston – a beautiful city famous for, among other things, its tea party (above). Here we were reminded every few minutes that “Of course you English lost the war!” Jacky Hathaway wins a £250 Railbookers voucher More feedback from readers Absence from school affects other pupils Sally Peck writes about the effect that the strict observance of school holidays is having upon businesses ( “Ban on term-time holidays hits West Country” , September 5). I see this from the perspective of the schools, in which absences from the classroom disrupt lessons. Teachers should not be expected to put their lessons on hold for a week so that those pupils on holiday do not miss essential work; neither should teachers be called upon to give extra lessons to the absentees upon their return. Both of these ideas were put to me by parents during the time that I was a teacher, so that they, the parents, could enjoy holidays at a cheaper time of year. However, I could never take my holidays at the cheaper times, because I had no choice in the matter. Teachers always have to pay the highest prices for their holidays. While I sympathise with those trying to make a living from our short holiday season, perhaps they should find more ways to encourage those without school-age children to take their holidays off-peak? J Tilley Scottish lodgings I enjoyed reading the article “Stately secrets revealed” (August 29) and in particular the piece on Traquair House. However, I was slightly surprised by the choice of accommodation recommended in the “Stay nearby” section. I’m sure that The Roxburghe Hotel, Kelso, is a lovely place, but Kelso is 33 miles away from Traquair. It would make far more sense to suggest accommodation in Peebles, seven miles away, or better still, the fabulous Windlestraw Lodge in Walkerburn, a walk of just three miles. Alison S E Smith Truth of Mont Saint-Michel Anthony Peregrine views Mont Saint-Michel through rose-coloured spectacles ( “Bridging the gap to the sublime” , September 5). In daylight hours, a visitor must endure an arduous trek to the Mont, to be greeted by a gruelling climb over cobbles and up steep steps, past tacky shops and noisy crowds. The tranquillity of “La Merveille” is lost in the high season. Only in the dead of night, when the parking is free and the Mont opens its doors to a beautiful light show, does this Normandy jewel become worth its weight in gold. Gillian Gain Cool in Copenhagen Further to your front-page story on the Tribeca district of New York ( “Robert De Niro’s New York” , July 4), tucked away in the sophisticated Danish capital is Kodbyen, the home of Copenhagen’s very own meatpacking district. Mimetic of its New York counterpart, the area was developed by the council. Now housing a creative social hub, the buildings have been reinvented; most of the warehouse complex is now a collection of bars, clubs, restaurants and galleries. In a city made up almost exclusively of either traditional buildings or ultra-modern examples of Scandinavian design, Kodbyen’s combination of austere exteriors and tasteful refurbishment gives it a “shabby-chic” feel. By day, you can browse the area’s art galleries and enjoy a spot of lunch. However, with its wide range of bars and clubs, it is by night that it really comes to life. Expect different music along the way; head to Mesteren & Laerlingen for hip-hop, reggae and disco, or to places like Jolene and Bakken if you want to sample the city’s electronic music scene.
