Source: Supplied \nTOURISM bosses in a Japanese prefecture have come up with what they hope will draw more feline-loving visitors: a Google-style street view for cats. \nBilled as a world’s first, officials this week launched an online map that explores the streets of port city Onomichi from the purr-spective of a four-pawed visitor. \n“We decided to focus on cats because they know everything about the city, including the backstreets,” a tourism spokesman for western Hiroshima prefecture told AFP. \nHe added that the city of about 150,000 people is known for its many felines and has a street known as “cat lane”. This tour is rather different to most. Source: Supplied \nThe map is based on the perspective of Lala, a fluffy kitty with emerald-coloured eyes, who lives with local hair salon owner. \nSo far the map covers just two streets but plans to expand its reach are in the works using a camera attached to a stick that hovers 20 centimetres above the ground. \nViewers can trace what Lala — appointed the head of the prefecture’s “backstreet tourism” division — sees from her low-level perspective. \nThe unlikely feline-focused tourism bid is not Japan’s first. Provincial Wakayama prefecture drew thousands of tourists to its regional train station where a cat served as nominal stationmaster. \nTortoiseshell-coloured Tama was credited with single-pawedly saving the provincial Kishigawa Line after being appointed as master of the tiny Kishi station. \nWith the regional railway losing money, the station lost its last human employee in April 2006, passing on the mantle to Tama, who delighted in strolling around her own office wearing the formal uniform cap of Wakayama Electric Railway. \nAfter Tama’s death in June, a new cat took over the position. It’s a cats world in Japan. Source: Supplied", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T09:57:16.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
