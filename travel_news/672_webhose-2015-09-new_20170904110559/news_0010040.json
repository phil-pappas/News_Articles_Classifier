This belief underlies everything that Cathay Pacific does as it strives to enhance the overall travel experience for passengers and enable them to experience more genuine, meaningful and memorable moments along their journey.\nCathay Pacific believes that mobile technologies and social media platforms are useful tools,\nbut they can be dangerously addictive. Did you know an average adult checks his or her phone 150 times a day? Or that 30% of iPhone users check their Twitter feeds before getting out of bed? This virtual world behaviour might get in the way of some very special real world moments.\nThe airline continually strives to enhance the overall travel experience, and believes that\ntravelling well is an important part of living well. Cathay Pacific aims to create a social media movement to discover what Life Well Travelled means to fellow passengers, and to inspire travellers to see the world in different ways, to experience richer real world moments and creating more meaningful memories. Through #onedayoffline, travellers will be encouraged to experience the world from a whole new perspective simply by switching off their online connection next time they travel.\nCathay Pacific General Manager Marketing, Loyalty Programmes & CRM Julian Lyden said:\n“Life Well Travelled is Cathay Pacific’s core brand philosophy which leads to the #onedayoffline campaign. At Cathay Pacific, we believe that travelling well is an important part of living well. When you travel well, your trip can become more rewarding.\n“We are aware that many travellers are overly reliant on their internet-connected mobile devices and the habit of always being online can sometimes get in the way of our travel experiences.\nThrough the launch of #onedayoffline, we aim to remind and help people to travel well, creating a deeper emotional connection between Cathay Pacific and our global travellers,” Mr Lyden continued.\nInfluential bloggers, top YouTube and Instagram users and celebrities from around the world will be taking part in the #onedayoffline campaign. They include Devin Graham from the United States, who has over more than 3 million followers on his YouTube channel, and well-known artists such as Hong Kong DJ/actor Sammy Leung. All will be supporting #onedayoffline by switching their devices off and recognising real moments during their next journey.\nSource:- Cathay Pacific", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T09:04:13.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
