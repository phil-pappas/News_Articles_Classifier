Located at Kata Beach, the compact 24-year-old boutique hotel boasts ample beach access and pleasingly simple facilities. The hotel takes its name from the L-shaped building that is designed to look slightly like a boat. All 38 rooms, which are newly renovated, are lined up along a narrow corridor to assimilate cabins aboard a ship. You might feel a little claustrophobic as you make your way to your room but once inside, you'll be greeted by a relaxing, airy and peaceful vibe thanks to the simple yet thoughtful design. Spanning from 36 to 136 square meters cross eight categories, all rooms come with private balcony or terrace, flat screen TV and cable channels, complimentary Wi-Fi access, bath or rain shower, fully equipped mini bar, espresso machine and Cafes Richard Grands Crus coffee pods and a selection of Ronnefeldt teas. Not all rooms have ocean view and the compact size of the building also means you won't get much privacy, as you are either facing the pool or the common lounging area. Food and beverage wise, Boathouse offers two outlets: the renowned Boathouse Wine & Grill, which became the first establishment in Thailand to win the Wine Spectator Best of Award of Excellence in 2006, and the newly added Re Ka Ta beachfront restaurant, which received the same award in 2012. If you're feeling adventurous, the Kata Beach restaurant and bar scene is an easy walk from the hotel. The real highlight of Boathouse is the beach, which stretches along the side of the hotel and offers stunning views of the ocean from sunrise to sunset, especially from the restaurant and the beach club. You can lie down on the sand, or lounge around in one of the cabanas by the infinity pool and enjoy an unobstructed panoramic view of the ocean unlike anywhere on the island. As the hotel is located on the far end of the beach, it is much less busy and feels almost like a private beach dedicated only to hotel guests. The location is also decent for surfing. Boathouse offers surfing and stand-up paddle boarding at reasonable prices. You can also learn how to surf at the Re Ka Ta Surf School. Other amenities include cooking class on weekends, pampering spa, airport transfer, medical service on call and baby-sitting service and baby cots. Boathouse does not offer grand luxury but has enough comfort and style enhanced by genuinely friendly and helpful staff to make it a decent sanctuary for any holidaymaker looking for a perfect balance between tranquillity and fun. AT A GLANCE High points: Tranquil with simple and comfortable amenities, the hotel offers friendly service, a lot of beach access and is a decent spot for surfing. Low points: Only a few rooms enjoy full view of the ocean, and it's an hour's drive from the airport. Pay for it: Check the website for the best deals and promotions.
