The tax may be up tp â‚¬2 per person per day with reductions for pensioners and children.About 11 million visitors visit Majorca, Ibiza and Menorca each year, allegedly causing water shortages and leaving an estimated 90,000 tons of rubbish in their wake. The islands have a resident population of less than 1 million.There is growing local impatience with this huge invasion. German and British people buy almost half the property for sale on the islands, forcing up prices for locals.On the other hand tourism accounts for 85% of the regional income. It has raised the standard of living of islanders above the European average.An ABTA spokesman said: \"We have not had official confirmation from the Balearic authorities that they intend to reintroduce this tax but if this turns out to be the case, we will write to them expressing our concerns and reminding them that it would only have the unintended consequence of driving tourists away from the islands.\"Of course safeguarding the environment of the islands has to be a high priority but this tax is not the most sensible way funding these efforts.\"The new proposed tax would also be charged to residents living on the islands.Biel Barcelo, vice president of the islands' coalition government, told Mail Online: \"It [the tax] will be applied with or without the help of the Spanish state. It is absolutely necessary.\"Recently, in nearby Barcelona, the new leftist mayor, Ada Colau, applied a brake to tourism which has halted 30 projects that were in the process of being licensed, including some significant hotel investments.Barcelona needs to put a brake on tourism development and \"begin a process of participatory reflection instead of going around putting out fires,\" she said, adding \"It was a priority to impose order. Up to now, tourist policy has been handled with patches.\"See Barcelona's new mayor to curb unsustainable tourism: HERE Valere TjolleNew service special pre-release offer: SustainableTourism2015.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-23T02:11:11.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
