Since the launch of The Cedar Club, which cost more than £914,398 to create, Lane End Conference Centre has seen an increase in bookings since the start of the financial year. \nThe Cedar Club is an indoor leisure facility which boasts two indoor virtual golf booths, a games room, a fully equipped gym, sauna and steam room. It also comes with a comfortable and contemporary lounge, bar and outside terrace. “The Cedar Club offers delegates and attendees a place to network and engage with each other away from work whilst benefiting from the leisure facilities on offer,” comments Heni Fourie, Sales Marketing Manager at Lane End Conference Centre. “Meetings and training can often be quite taxing on delegates so more and more businesses are looking for something a little different to achieve greater engagement and interaction. We wanted to offer something on-site that encouraged delegates to relax after a busy day and complimented our state-of-the-art meeting and leisure facilities here at Lane End - The Cedar Club does just that.” Work on the double storey sports and leisure centre began in 2014 and the soft launch was attended by local customers, supporters and students of Lane End’s sister company the Euro Japanese Exchange Foundation earlier this year. The launch was in memory of the centre’s founder Dr. William Barry who passed away in January 2012. The Cedar Club is the latest development in a series of refurbishment and ongoing development projects. Heni Fourie added: “It was important for us to expand our leisure offer by improving the indoor options, giving our guests the best possible choice of both fitness and leisure activities to choose from whilst on-site.” Lane End Conference Centre is set in 26 acres and offers two tennis courts, a 9-hole footgolf course, beach volleyball, five a side football, outdoor fitness track, 1-mile running track, three coffee lounges with snooker, outdoor terraces and three private bars in addition to the brand new Cedar Club. Lane End Conference Centre, based in the stunning setting of Buckinghamshire, offers a unique modular design with five distinct and completely self-contained conference buildings – each offering bedrooms, meeting facilities, bar, lounge and dining room – available for exclusive use.
