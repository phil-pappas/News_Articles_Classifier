NJ Transit buses serve more than 60 percent of the terminal's passengers during peak periods. \nCoach USA, which includes the Rockland, Shortline, Suburban and Community Coach lines, will have most of its gates on the fourth floor. \nThe changes also affect DeCamp and Lakeland riders. \nCommuters can learn whether their specific bus routes are assigned to new gates at the Port Authority's website: www.panynj.gov/PABTgates \nThe Port Authority also will display signs at strategic locations and staff also will be on hand to direct passengers to their gates. \nThe gate realignment continues efforts begun last fall to streamline bus operations to reduce congestion in the terminal, which can stretch out into the inbound Lincoln Tunnel and beyond. \nThe gate reassignment is part of the $90 million quality of commute initiative, which the Port Authority's board approved in 2014. \n\"The consolidation of NJ Transit's operations and Coach USA's operations will empower those carriers to better manage their bus logistics within the terminal, and build on our previous successes in helping buses arrive and leave on time,\" bus terminal general manager Diannae Ehler said. \nThe Port Authority, which also operates New York-area bridges, tunnels, ports, airports and the World Trade Center, has heard criticism over the state of the bus terminal. \nEarlier this year, a group of proposals to build a new terminal was panned by Port Authority commissioners as too expensive or not feasible. \nFIND YOUR GATE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T07:24:10.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
