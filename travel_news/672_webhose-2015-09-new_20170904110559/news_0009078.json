The Association would like to thank SEALIFE Mooloolaba for supporting this exercise which has resulted in identification of how the criteria can be better applied in aquatic environments.” \nSEA LIFE Mooloolaba relaunched in December 2013, unveiling five new zones – Seahorse Sanctuary, Pacific Reef, Jelly Fish Kingdom, Tidal Touch Pool and Coastal Wreck, on top of the already existing informative and interactive exhibits. \nThe aquarium is committed to the rehabilitation of sick and injured marine animals, with its Turtle Hospital equipped to host dozens of injured turtles at a time. The turtles are cared for in a facility solely dedicated to the animal, which includes various tanks holding between five and 1,500L of water. \nSEA LIFE Mooloolaba rescues and rehabilitates endangered turtles before releasing them back into the ocean, nursing more than 850 turtles over the past two decades. \nOther highlights of the attraction are Seal Island with Australian and New Zealand Fur Seals and Sea Lions on display, and the walkthrough Ocean Tunnel, home to majestic sharks, a variety of rays and an explosion of colour in the unique Coral Cove.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T12:51:49.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
