I hate the suburbs. I would love to live out in the country and have acres and acres and horses and cows. But how could I afford the land? Land was available here and cheaper. The Gardening for Greenbacks grant from the city helped. I've got about an acre on 10 city lots, mostly on West 61st and West 63rd.\nWasn't the soil here polluted?\nNot so much polluted; just depleted of any nutrients. It was fallow. There was nothing growing. So each year we bring in soil, test it and amend it.\nWhat do you grow?\nAlmost everything. A lot of greens, beets, turnips, canteloupes, eggplants, peppers, tomatoes, radishes. I make preserves and granola bars with our berries. This year, we've got the sexiest Tuscan kale I've ever grown.\nWe have ducks and chickens. We had goats for six months, but they eat everything.\nWho buys the stuff?\nWe have a farm stand at 3164 W. 61st. It's open Fridays 4 to 6 and Saturdays 10 to 12. We've created a good, solid, loyal customer base, including customers from outside the neighborhood.\nWe also go to the LEAF market in Lakewood and sell to Fresh Fork Market customers. We do our own CSA [a package plan known as community-supported agriculture], too.,\nHow's the growing season in Cleveland?\nWe do three seasons of growing. I've got two hoop houses.\nDoes our lively weather confuse the crops?\nThis year, we had the cold spring and early summer. Everything took forever to grow. Then all the sudden we had this massive burst of heat. It was tough on the plants. It was tough on me.\nDo you have help on the farm?\nI have one or two workers seasonally. And we're part of Youth Opportunities Unlimited. We have five youths who help us for six months.\nIs the neighborhood safe?\nWe had six chickens stolen. The next day some guy rides past me and says would you like six ducks? He had to get rid of them.\nWhy do you like farming?\nIt's a sense of freedom and being connected to the earth, the smells, the air, especially after a dreary Cleveland winter. I love the satisfaction of growing, the challenge. I like the stewardship: preserving the land. We don't use any chemicals or pesticides. I focus on building an ecosystem.\nHow'd you get into farming?\nGrandma's garden on Scranton started it. I got stung by a bee there. But, since then, I've been growing food all my life.\nSo you grew up in Cleveland?\nNo. I left when I was about 4Â½. My Dad was in the service. I lived in Philadelphia for a good part of my life. When Dad retired, he and the rest of my family moved back here. I moved back about eight years ago. My children were grown already, and I'd had two family members pass away here. I didn't want to come home for more funerals. I wanted to enjoy being with family.\nWho's in your family today?\nI've got three children, all grown, and two grandchildren. I've got relatives in Brunswick and Medina. My husband, Russ Morgan, is the chef at Mahall's 20 Lanes in Lakewood. Their chickens and burgers are all locally grown.\nAny gripes about the town?\nIn Philly, we could walk everywhere. I didn't have a car. I could go to the shore or Bucks County by train. It'd be great to see more of that here.\nWhere does a farmer grab a bite?\nI like to go to the Sachsenheim. They've got liters of Dunkelweiss beer. Taco Tuesday's a bomb.\nTacos at the Saschenheim? Sounds like Cleveland. Anyway, do you like the neighborhood?'\nI love the Stockyards. A neighbor tells stories about her mom being chased down the street by cattle. Now it's so quiet and peaceful you wouldn't know you're in the city. I come here to get away.\nEverybody knows everybody. I was sitting on my porch two nights ago and watching the kids in our neighborhood. There were white, Puerto Rican, black, all playing together. They were really friends. What an example for us as adults!\nAre you active in the neighborhood?\nWe've got a whole group of volunteers in Stockyards Connections. Someone donated space. We're fundraising to get repairs. We'd like eventually to have a coffee shop, a laser tag area, a piano, art, games. We're having a Halloween festival this year.\nWe want to do a crosswalk with a picture of cattle. We want to start painting alleyways. We're going to do a Rainworks project on the sidewalk on West 63rd with poetry and affirmative things. It's through City Repair. We're having a design party Oct. 3. [ See Stockyards Connections on Facebook .]\nWe've got another group working on saving Storer Park at Storer and 67th. It's the only greenspace we have. There's talk of selling it to a manufacturing company and building on it.\nI also have a community garden on West 63rd.\nYou help neighbors grow their own food instead of buying yours?\nIt's a neighborhood. We're all in this together.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Stockyards-Connections-274861236013047"], "published": "2015-09-24T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T01:56:43.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
