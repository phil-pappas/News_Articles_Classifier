What would your ultimate trip to Italy look like? Some travelers delight in weeks of planning and plotting before exploring a foreign country. I do not, nor does my otherwise patient husband, Steve. In fact, the state of our union can be greatly influenced by travel-related stress.\nOur version of a fantasy Italian vacation? No driving, no logistics, no feeble attempts to master the language. What a luxury it is to simply show up, rest and be immersed in nothing but the joys of enchanting Italy, which is why we recently left all details to luxury travel company Abercrombie & Kent.\nA&K’s Connections Italy: South to North tour is anything but typical and everything extraordinary. Whether the first or fifth jaunt to Italy, we all long for authentic, inspiring, memorable experiences — for travel with meaning. Allow me to invite you along on this amazing 13-day journey, as we blissfully experience hundreds of miles of Italy, from Capri to Venice.\nThe tour hits the requisite highlights: Pompeii, the Roman Colosseum, incredible museums and basilicas such as the Sistine Chapel, Uffizi Gallery, St. Mark’s Cathedral and St. Peter’s Basilica, but it also focuses on lesser-known treasures and on unique, off-the-beaten path local-culture experiences.\nHere, a glimpse of what to expect.\nSorrento, Amalfi and Capri Welcome to the Naples airport, where you’re greeted and whisked away to nearby Sorrento. The drive is a pleasant one, allowing time for those initial oohs and ahhs as you wind through the cliffs and hills of this region. If you’re lucky, the sun will be at its golden hour, and you’ll catch a sunset over the Mediterranean Sea.\nThe caliber of lodging on your tour is all four-star or above, like the beautiful Hilton Sorrento Palace, with its expansive multilevel swimming pool, excellent views and terrace restaurant overlooking the Bay of Naples.\nThe tour director for the trip has already been hand-selected. In our case, we had the good fortune to welcome Emanuela Spadoni into our circle of friends. Hailing from Italy and being well-versed in art, history and architecture, Emanuela quickly became our momma, watching over her 16 chicks with precision.\nThe vacation is designed so guests really get the vibe of an area — getting to touch it and smell it and taste it and not just view it from a bus. You’ll do plenty of walking, beginning with Sorrento, the scenic Amalfi Coast and Positano, a jaw-dropping town built into the cliff face. Next, a hydrofoil boat transports you to the mountainous island of Capri. Enjoy upscale restaurants and shops, especially those selling glamorous hand-made sandals such as Il Sandalo Caprese.\nOne of many local connections occurs in the small village of Schiazzano, with a charming family that produces mozzarella. See how it’s made, then sample it along with provolone, ricotta and focaccia right out of the brick oven.\nRome In addition to your tour director, each destination features a local specialist. The tour also features several intimate meals in family-owned restaurants and trattorias, and tonight is no exception. You’ll experience a wine tasting and dinner in the Trastevere-district home of local resident Barbara Beni. What a treat to be welcomed into “BB’s kitchen,” a cozy residence bursting with charm and serving exquisite Italian cooking.\nSiena In scenic Siena, your local expert introduces you to the Piazza del Campo, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the finest squares in Italy. Revel in the history of the famous Palio horse races, stroll the Old World streets, browse the shops and have a leisurely lunch.\nColorful local markets and delis, like Sapori & Dintorni Conad in the heart of Siena, make for fun and affordable lunch options, with an abundance of salamis, prosciuttos, cheeses, olives and gelatos.\nCinque Terre You’ll soon see why the Cinque Terre is one of the most extraordinary places on earth. Five scenic villages cling to coastal cliffs along the Italian Riviera. The colors, layers and textures are mesmerizing. Blend into the local scene by taking the public train between each, or, for the more hardy, hike the many miles of paths and trails.\nFlorence Say buon giorno to Florence and the fabulous Hotel Brunelleschi, situated in the historical heart of the city, with a magical tower dating to the Byzantine period and a posh renovation that merges muted shades of eggplant and gray.\nThe most important Renaissance sites are covered in detail by your guides; you’ll also partake in unique experiences such as Le Cordon Bleu cooking school, where the fruit of your labor is a classic Florentine lunch.\nA&K builds in time to explore each city on your own. Around the corner from the cooking school is an absolute oasis: Four Seasons Hotel Firenze, set in an 11-acre park with art-filled gardens, a welcoming pool and sizable spa. Best of all, visitors can purchase day passes to savor these amenities.\nSave time and energy for an enchanting, pinch-me-I’m-dreaming evening out. Just a beautiful 15-minute drive finds you in the lush hills surrounding Florence, where the castlelike 15th-century villa Il Salviatino is perched. Sip prosecco on the terrace and savor an impeccable dinner in a fairytale setting overlooking the Duomo and idyllic town below.\nVenice Your intimate group travels by coach to Venice, stopping for a gastronomic connection: a private tour and tasting of balsamic vinegar at Acetaia Paltrinieri.\nVenice is teeming with elegant canals, bridges, basilicas and palaces, and you will be guided to the best of them. Make another connection, this time at an authentic Venetian mask workshop, Ca’del Sol. Learn about this important part of Venetian culture, visit the artist’s shop, and you might even get to model a full Italian carnival costume.\nYou’ll have time to slip away for dinner on your own, and Antinoo’s Lounge & Restaurant at Centurion Palace hotel is a splendid choice. The modern restaurant overlooks the Grand Canal, and chef Massimo Livan serves specialties like gazpacho Andaluso with raw red Sicilian prawns, fisherman’s style risotto carnaroli, and cuttlefish in black ink sauce.\nTime to awake from your dreamy Italian vacation, but it’s not often you get to step out the door of your hotel and be escorted by private watercraft, guide included, to a smooth and seamless journey back home.\nAs Geoffrey Kent, founder and CEO of Abercrombie & Kent, writes in his new memoir, Safari (Harper, $35), “Travel teaches us as much about ourselves as it does about the world — it shifts our focus away from the meager challenges of every day and recalibrates our life’s vision to something broader and much more significant.” Well said, Geoffrey, and thanks to you for paving the way.\nArrivederci , for now, dolce Italia .\nJanet Thomas is a writer and photographer based in Dallas and Florida.\nWhen you go Abercrombie & Kent offers several luxury travel options, with the Connections Group journeys starting about $5,695 per person for 13 days.
