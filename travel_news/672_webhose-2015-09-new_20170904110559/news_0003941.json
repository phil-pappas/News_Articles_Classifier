And I certainly don't expect it will get me out of a bad situation. Why count on something that is, by definition, random and unpredictable? I also know my track record for losing things, especially on the road. And losing your trusted source of good luck . . . too much bad luck to contemplate.\nYet, I am fascinated by them. The symbols, charms, icons that are considered good luck by a culture, a country, a religion are a real window into their roots and beliefs. Once you understand the stories behind them, they add another dimension to your experience - you can pick out the traditional motifs and icons the locals have woven into the stuff of everyday life - from the blue-glass amulet hanging from a taxi mirror in Istanbul to the petroglyph-like symbol of a man holding an arc featured on the tourism logo of northern Spain.\nI may not believe a lucky charm will make sure I don't miss my flight or train, but that doesn't mean I don't invest in them. I often buy them as souvenirs or presents. In many cases, they're unique to a destination, part of local life - and they let you take a slice of that life away with you. And if you're giving the gift of good luck, well, what goes around . . .\nMore coverage Los Angeles museum honors architect Frank Gehry with retrospective Smart tourists blend in like locals Detroit's status as bicycling hotspot grows with Slow Roll Chanchito: Pigs are a popular source of good luck in many cultures, but this little piggy from Pomaire, Chile, is notable because he's missing a leg. Artisans in Pomaire, known for its natural clay and traditional pottery, create terra cotta chanchitos that are popular gifts. Though the origins of the three-legged legend are vague - some say chanchito was created with three legs, others that someone broke a leg off - the pig remained upright.\nA three-legged pig that can still stand proves that it's lucky.\nDream catcher: Native American cultures make these hanging fetishes, with a central stylized web and natural embellishments, such as feathers.\nThey are based on the legend of Nokomis, the grandmother in Ojibwa folklore. Nokomis watched a spider weave its web day after day until one day her grandson came in and tried to kill the spider. She protected the spider, and, in return, the spider went to the window and spun a fresh web, explaining that nightmares would be strained out. Only good dreams would make it through the holes.\nCharms to counter evil eyes : Evil eyes are among the most widespread sources of bad luck, so various cultures have come up with a range of antidotes, often blue, symbolizing heaven or godliness.\nAmong the most distinctive is the nazar boncugu, especially popular in Turkey, where it's on everything that can be eyeballed. The blue stone is an amalgamation of molten glass, iron, copper, water, and salt - a combination that provides a shield from evil, as the locals explain. It also has an eye on it, as in \"an eye for an eye.\"\nEkeko : The traditional god of abundance and prosperity of people in the Andes. The Ekeko can be a doll or statue; he sports a mustache and traditional Andean clothes (especially the poncho) and is loaded down with bags and baskets of grain and food, household objects, money.\nMost popular forms are a little statue to be put in some comfortable place of the house or in an amulet. Once a year, a cigarette is lit for Ekeko to smoke to ensure a full year of prosperity. And modern statues include a circular opening to facilitate the ritual.\nElephants: Another popular symbol of good luck in the countries where they're found. In India, the god Ganesh has an elephant head - the pachyderm's wisdom and longevity enable Ganesh to smooth the way to success and good luck.\nFour-leaf clover : St. Patrick first used the three-leaf clover to represent the Holy Trinity, and Irish Druids used it as a good-luck charm (due to its triangular shape) before Christianity came to the Emerald Isle. The roots are in Ireland, but they are considered lucky no matter where you find them - the odds of that are about 1 in 10,000. The four leaves represent hope, faith, love, and luck.\nHamsa (also Hand of Fatima) : This hand-shaped symbol is found in many societies and religions, and though the legends behind them may differ, the open palm, often with an eye in the center, is used to protect against that evil eye and attract good luck.\nIndalo: The symbol, which seems to depict a man holding an arc over his head, was discovered in a cave in the Spanish province of Almeria. Many believe it represents a prehistoric god holding a rainbow and protecting man, and that it dates to the Neolithic period.\nThe indalo became a local good-luck charm and protection against the evil eye - at least until industry and the economy dried up in the region and people moved away in droves. In the 1960s, Almeria began a rebirth when the symbol was rediscovered by artists and writers who embraced it as a symbol of the area - now up on its once-down luck.\nLaughing Buddha: Of the many Buddha statues out there, the laughing Buddha is the most universal and popular of feng shui cures, bringing good luck, abundance, happiness, success, good health.\nThe laughing Buddha was a monk who lived in 10th-century China. He was a bit too eccentric for a monk, but his heart was loving and open, and he became much beloved and accepted. Also known as the happy or the traveling Buddha, it adds the energy of joy and laughter to everyday life.\nRudraksh beads : These are the seeds of trees found in the Himalayas, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It's said the first rudraksh tree sprang from a single tear shed by Lord Shiva, the Hindu god of all living creatures, after a blissful meditation. The beads were used for rosaries, and are used for all kinds of amulets today. They are especially good for people constantly on the move (that's travelers), creating a protective cocoon of the wearer's energy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T15:27:47.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
