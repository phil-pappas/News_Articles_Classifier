An exciting partnership between Victor and Cuba Educational Travel (CET), a premiere and federally approved on-the-ground operator that plans unique experiences with some of Cuba's top influencers and tastemakers, means that US travelers have access to the luxuries of the formerly forbidden island for the first time ever. \nFollowing the historic re-establishment of diplomatic ties between Cuba and the U.S., the new routes and itineraries by CET abide by all federal guidelines, making the planning process with Victor completely seamless. Guests will enjoy ultra-exclusive experiences such as cigar and rum tastings with Cuba's leading cigar expert and master distiller, a private cocktail reception and viewing with Cuba's leading artists, intimate concerts with renowned entertainers such as the Buena Vista Social Club, Carlos Varela and Gente de Zona, and exclusive dinners with prominent cultural figures, historians or other specialists. Itineraries are customizable to the desires of the traveler and include accommodations in hotels or upscale rented homes, travel in classic American autos from the 1950s, top-notch restaurants and all event and activity programming. Victor members in the U.S. can book direct flights to Havana from 19 major US cities, including Atlanta, Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Fort Lauderdale, Houston, Los Angeles, Key West, Miami, New York City, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Oakland, Orlando, Palm Beach, Pittsburgh, Fort Myers, Tampa and Puerto Rico. \n\"During the past several months, strengthened relations between the U.S. and Cuba has piqued travel interest for private jet travelers in the U.S.,\" said Clive Jackson, CEO and Founder of Victor. \"We continue to push the boundaries of private aviation by becoming the first private jet charter service to offer unique, exclusive access to Cuban culture and unrivaled programming through our partnership with Cuba Educational Travel.\" \nVictor and Cuba Educational Travel are able to customize programs for single travelers, families or larger groups.
