But the best way to get to the top of Merkur Mountain takes a little more looking. On the eastern outskirts of this beautiful spa town in southwestern Germany lies a funicular, the MerkurBergbahn. For the uninitiated, a funicular is a track-bound vehicle that pulls its riders up a steep incline, a feat made possible by a car of equal weight making a simultaneous descent. I’ve found the humble funicular to be Europe’s most underrated mode of transportation. Just as trains are ideal for those intermediate journeys — between short-distance driving excursions and long-haul air travel — funiculars split the difference between walkable hills and the terrifying cable cars that service Alpine peaks. The funicular grants access to worthy sites like Heidelberg’s famous castle while slashing the levels of time and effort required. And the top of Merkur Mountain, a peak unreachable by car, certainly qualifies as a worthy sight. From its summit, a full 2,191 feet above sea level, Merkur Mountain offers an amazing vantage point on the Black Forest, the French countryside just across the nearby border and the town of Baden-Baden nestled into the valley. The paragliders sailing above the scenery punctuate the vast view. While that view is the main attraction, riding the funicular is a fascinating trip, particularly for those with an interest in transportation. It’s advertised as one of Europe’s steepest funiculars, at one point navigating a 54 percent grade, and covers the journey of 1,214 feet in about five minutes. The en-route views are largely limited to the track ahead and shrubbery on both sides, but peeks of the awaiting spectacle begin to come into view over the final minute of the journey. The funicular has another claim to fame beyond its extreme incline. The system runs without an operator; it functions more like an elevator. Riders buy their tickets at the bottom either from the cashier at the gift shop or a vending machine and proceed through an unmanned turnstile. After stepping onto the vehicle, an intrepid rider presses the button that puts the car in motion. Alarms sound, the doors slide closed and the funicular begins its climb, passing the downward-traveling car on an adjacent track at the halfway point. If you’ve bought a round-trip ticket — some riders opt to take the funicular up and hike down — you’ll repeat the process at the top. It’s not quite as adventurous as leaping off the top of the mountain on a paraglider. But gliding down the side of Merkur Mountain on the MerkurBergbahn, perhaps set to extend your journey into the luxurious center of Baden-Baden, you’ll hardly feel disappointed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T17:21:36.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
