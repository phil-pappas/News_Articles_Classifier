After their magnificent achievement, the BOSS Watches H1Club has decided to recognise the double feat by rewarding each golfer with a specially commissioned commemorative timepiece. The remarkable event happened on the 135-yard, par-three ninth, during a pairs match between Sprowston Manor GC and Royal Norwich. Mr Saddleton, 29, an eight-handicapper representing Sprowston Manor, thought he had won the hole after his smooth nine-iron ace, but then his 43-year-old opponent, who plays off seven, did exactly the same thing, also with a nine-iron, for an astonishing half-point. The visiting player, who has played golf for 10 years, said: “I couldn’t believe it. I don’t think I will ever experience that again. It’s a game of golf I will never forget. “After I hit my hole-in-one, I even remember Mark saying something like, ‘So that’s what I need to do,’ and then he did exactly the same thing. I can’t believe I hit a hole-in-one but didn’t win the hole.” Bookmaker Paddy Power gave the staggering odds of two amateur golfers scoring aces on the same hole as 25,000,000/1 Mr Avis added: “When I saw my opponent score a hole-in-one, I knew what I had to do. I then hit my shot and the ball cleared the bunker and rolled into the hole – unbelievable. “I was amazed; we were all stunned. It’s a moment in history; you can’t make it up.” Bookmaker Paddy Power gave the staggering odds of two amateur golfers scoring aces on the same hole as 25,000,000/1. Despite Sprowston winning the match 3-1 overall, the Saddleton-Avis game, fittingly, finished all square. Meanwhile, life’s a gas for retired piping superintendent James Maguire, who achieved three holes-in-one in just 11 days – his latest rewarding him with a BOSS watch. The 64-year-old, from Tullibody, near Stirling, plays off 19. He achieved his ace treble at his home club, Braehead, and began his lucky streak with his seven-iron on the 145-yard, par-three eighth, during a seniors’ Friday sweep competition. It was simply astonishing to get three holes-in-one so quickly – and the BOSS watch really was the cherry on the cake Mr Maguire achieved his next ace just a week later, on the 184-yard, par-three 14th, with his five-wood, while competing in the invitational Sambuca Cup competition. Four days later, he completed his hat-trick with his six-iron, on the 168-yard, par-three 11th, during a Tuesday Stableford competition. Mr Maguire said: “After achieving the first and second holes-in-one, I thought: ‘I’m never going to get a BOSS watch now.’ The odds against getting one were just too much. “I couldn’t believe it when I achieved my third ace – it was an absolutely fantastic feeling and I was thrilled when I found out I’d be receiving a BOSS watch after all. “I took up golf when I was 34 and have only scored one other hole-in-one. It was back in 1994 at Thornton Golf Club, in Fife, on the old 130-yard, par-three 11th hole, with an eight-iron. “As it was so long ago, it was simply astonishing to get three so quickly – and the BOSS watch really was the cherry on the cake. “I retired from the oil and gas industry recently, so I’m not travelling as much, which means I get to practise a lot more. I think the hours spent in the back garden working on my swing are starting to pay off, but there’s no secret to getting a hole-in-one. It’s all down to the right club selection and line – the rest is just luck.” Lady Luck had already smiled during Braehead’s Tuesday Stableford, as club member Brian Christie, 72 – a nine-handicapper, from Menstrie – had won a BOSS timepiece, holing-in-one at the 158-yard, par-three sixth with his seven-iron. BOSS Watches H1 Club BOSS Watches has once again pledged to reward club golfers with an exclusive watch for every hole-in-one recorded during a club competition in 2015, having given away more than £1m-worth of limited-edition timepieces since its launch in 2013. The scheme is open to any golfer whose club uses HowDidiDo – a free-to use, web-based social network for golfers – and anybody playing in official club competitions is eligible. Currently, more than 1,800 clubs use the website. In addition to the limited-edition watches, the “ace” golfers join more than 7,000 members in the BOSS Watches H1Club, which offers access to exclusive benefits and merchandise. No extra registration is required to participate in the BOSS Watches promotion as all official club competitions are recorded on the HowDidiDo system, so holes-in-one are noted and automatically ratified by the golfer’s club. • For more information, visit H1Club.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T13:39:28.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
