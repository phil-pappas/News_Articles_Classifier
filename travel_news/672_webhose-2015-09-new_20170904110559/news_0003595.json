Pebble Beach is renowned as the best site and I would say Thracian Cliffs is twice as good as Pebble Beach.”\nWith two high-spec residential villages – many with panoramic sea views – gourmet restaurants, a bijou spa and its own beach club, Thracian Cliffs Golf & Beach Resort offers plenty for both golfers and lifestyle seekers, all within the unique environment of the Cape Kaliakra coast.\nAnd with summer on the horizon, its location – which benefits from plenty sunshine, lying, as it does, further south than Florence, Monaco or Marseille – boasts the perfect climate for the regular special events which take place on the unspoiled Bendida Beach, located directly on the seafront of the resort.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T22:06:24.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
