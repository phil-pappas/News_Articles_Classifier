If there is uncertainty, some organisers may decide to cancel shows to be on the safe side.” \nMr Beaver, who organises the annual Chalk Valley History Festival air show in Wiltshire, has already had to cancel a Battle of Britain 75th anniversary flypast over London by 20 Spitfires planned for September 20 after he was told the event would have to be insured for £250 million. \nHe added: “Air shows are a business and any profit tends to be a charity donation. If there is a risk that the event will make a loss because of increased insurance costs, they will not go ahead. \nThe 11 victims of the Shoreham air disaster \n“We’re all just hoping the insurance industry will be pragmatic and accept that the 63-year period between Shoreham and the previous fatalities among members of the public at an air show is a significant [safety record].” \nThe RAFBF and RAFA each received £135,000 from the Waddington show alone in 2013, and in 2014 the Shoreham Air Show raised £208,000 for RAFA. Interactive: PLANE LOOP \nThe RAF Charitable Trust, a grant-giving charity, relies almost totally on air shows for its income. Last year, £580,000 of its £690,000 income came from the Royal International Air Tattoo, with another £65,000 coming from the RAF Cosford Air Show, which donated the same amount to the RAFBF and RAFA, as well as the Royal Air Force Museum. \nThere is no suggestion any of these major air shows are under threat, but scores of smaller shows also raise money for the hundreds of forces charities. \nCharlotte Mellor sings on a Battle of Britain 75th anniversary CD to raise money for Forces charities Photo: Jim Dooley \nJim Dooley, head of fundraising for the Bomber Command Memorial in London and a fundraiser for the RAF Benevolent Fund, said the problems have already begun. \nVideo grab showing moments before the Hawker Hunter plane crashed on A27 \nMoments before the Hawker Hunter jet comes down on the A27 during the Shoreham Airshow in West Sussex Photo: Chris Watkins \nMoment the Hawker Hunter fighter jet crashed on the A27 during the Shoreham Air Show Photo: Terry Smith \nMr Dooley, who has raised more than £500,000 by taking and selling air-to-air photographs of vintage aeroplanes, said: “Normally I will do about four flights a year taking pictures to sell for charity, but so far this year I have only been able to do one. \n“Everyone is worried about insurance, so we are going to have to find different ways of raising money from now on.” \nMr Dooley, who had a career as a pop singer before he became a fundraiser, has written a song for the Battle of Britain 75th anniversary, called If You Hadn’t Done What You Did , sung by Charlotte Mellor, the 18-year-old daughter of an RAF officer, to raise money for the two charities he supports. Shoreham Air Show disaster How the events unfolded Saturday, August 22 Thousands gather at the Shoreham Airshow to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. At 1.20pm the scene turns to horror as a 1950's Hawker Hunter plane crashes into a busy A27 bypass, hitting at least four cars - including a wedding limousine Loss of control The pilot, 51-year-old former RAF officer Andy Hill, carries out a loop manoeuvre high in the air before smashing into the road in a huge fireball after failing to pull up in time Pilot wrestles with the controls Moments before the point of impact the pilot appears to be trying to pull up from the A27 as it plummets towards the dual carriageway, where dozens of onlookers can be seen watching the display Plane strikes the A27 The aicraft ploughs across the busy road just yards from cars and a group of people, its cockpit canopy open and wing ablaze, engulfing traffic lights, roadwork cones and signs in a huge ball of fire. Burning debris is also visible high in the air Cloud of death Dazed witnesses survey the scene on the A27 as smoke billows into the sky from several vehicles and people appear to try to help victims. Trail of destruction Seven people are confirmed dead with the toll expected to rise and a further two are taken to hospital, one with life threatening injuries. 14 people are treated at the scene Yet another tragedy It is the sixth disaster at an air show over the past seven years, resulting in a total of six deaths before Saturday’s incident, including a fatality in 2007 at the Shoreham event", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T00:26:01.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
