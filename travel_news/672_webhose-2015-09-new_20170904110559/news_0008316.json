Be date savvy If you have the availability, try and play around with your dates as flexibility is important when trying to get a better deal.\nBooking a Mediterranean cruise in mid-September compared with one a month earlier can save you hundreds! You should also pay attention to the day of the week you fly out, with Tuesday and Wednesday usually the least expensive days to travel.\n2. Keep an eye on the currency rates It’s always worth looking at the latest currency exchange rates before you choose your holiday destination.\nWith the Euro at its highest rate against the pound since 2008, choosing to take advantage of this and booking a Mediterranean, Baltic or Balkan escape will mean you can make your pound stretch further.\nEuropean cruises usually require less time aboard the ship so guests could spend more time exploring the many countries and cultures included in their itinerary, taking advantage of the excellent rates.\n3. The deals are real – so don’t forget to check! Many people don’t think to check the deals section of travel websites. It’s always worth taking a look, especially if you’re searching for a last minute holiday. Operators will often have stock they need to sell so, if you keep an eye out, you can bag some incredible deals.\n4. Book sooner rather than later It’s often the first question on a traveller’s mind – should I book later or earlier? Unfortunately, there’s no hard or fast rule, especially in the travel industry.\nWhile there are plenty of great late deals available to customers, the cruise industry often has some of its best deals months in advance.\nGoing forward, cruise lines are looking to change the way the booking system works so the prices go up closer to the departure. If you’re looking to try out a cruise in the future, it’s more likely that the best bargains will be found up to a year in advance of the departure.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.virginholidayscruises.co.uk/cruise-deals/sail-from-uk/", "http://www.cruisenation.com/", "http://www.pocruises.com/e521a/", "https://twitter.com/MirrorTravel", "http://www.royalcaribbean.co.uk/cruise-deals/2016-european-holidays/", "http://www.virginholidayscruises.co.uk/cruise-deals/", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.royalcaribbean.co.uk/cruise-deals/2015-holidays/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "http://www.fredolsencruises.com/cruise-offers/cruise-deals", "http://www.royalcaribbean.co.uk/cruise-deals/2016-uk-holidays/", "http://www.virginholidayscruises.co.uk/cruise-deals/family-cruise/", "http://www.virginholidayscruises.co.uk/destinations/british-isles/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "http://www.royalcaribbean.co.uk/cruise-deals/buy-one-get-one-half-price/", "http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=5833&awinaffid=213635&clickref=&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.travelzoo.com%2Fuk%2Fcruises%2Fcaribbean%2F-999pp-Caribbean-5-Island-Cruise-inc-Balcony-Cabin-2099180%2F", "http://www.thomson.co.uk/webcruise/page/cruise/booking/cruisecabinoptions.page?locationName=FLY+CRUISE&tuiDepartPortCode=PRT000465&tuiItineraryCode=ITN42083&tuiShipId=&tuiCruiseArea=CRA5&tuiAccomCode=&tuiAccomType=DZA&businessContextId=15&locationContextId=8&partyRoomConfiguration=1%7C2%7C0&partyStringForOmniture=%24%7BCruiseSearchCriteriaForm.partyStringForOmniture%7D&maxPartySize=9&accommodationType=20&cruiseradiobuttongroup=flyCruise&checkInDay=1&checkInMonthYear=10+2015&displayDay=&displayMonth=&displayYear=&duratio", "http://www.pocruises.com/early-savers/", "http://www.pocruises.com/cruise-deals/late-deals/", "http://www.virginholidayscruises.co.uk/cruise-deals/all-inclusive-cruises/", "http://www.pocruises.com/", "http://www.virginholidayscruises.co.uk/cruise-deals/walt-disney/"], "published": "2015-09-22T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-27T01:43:14.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
