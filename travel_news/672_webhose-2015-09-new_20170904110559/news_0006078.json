Many Six Flags parks have child-friendly activities during the day, then transition to nighttime Fright Fests, with creepy roaming creatures, haunted houses and scare zones. \nAt Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, HalloWeekends include daytime family friendly activities like the Great Pumpkin Fest, a parade and hay-bale mazes. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, the park becomes a more intense experience, with outdoor scare zones, haunted houses and edgy shows. \nGreat America in Santa Clara, California, also offers family friendly activities during the day, while nighttime thrills include roving monsters, nine mazes, scare zones and the park's thrill rides. \nCarowinds park in Charlotte, North Carolina, recommends its Scarowinds extravaganza -- including a homecoming at Zombie High -- for guests age 13 and older. \nBusch Gardens Tampa partnered with Robin Cowie, producer of \"The Blair Witch Project,\" to create \"Unearthed,\" about a woman named Scarlett who comes back to life after a construction crew digs too far. Busch Gardens Williamsburg gets scary with five Terror-tories and seven haunted houses. \nHAUNTWORLD'S TOP 15 \nHauntWorld.com 's list of top 15 haunted houses is topped by Haunted Overload, in Lee, New Hampshire, described by HauntWorld as \"an original outdoor haunt in a class of its own\" with \"handmade sets, gigantic monsters and spellbinding costumes with spectacular sound and lighting ... set in an eerie dark New England forest.\" Haunted Overload also won a $50,000 prize, named America's scariest display by ABC's \"The Great Halloween Fright Fight.\" \nThe other 14 listed by HauntWorld are Headless Horseman, in Ulster Park, New York; The 13th Gate in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the Dent Schoolhouse in Cincinnati; Netherworld in Atlanta; 13th Floor, San Antonio, Texas; Bennett's Curse, Baltimore; Erebus, Pontiac, Michigan; Bates Motel, Philadelphia; The Darkness, St. Louis; Cutting Edge, Dallas; Spookywoods, Greensboro, North Carolina; House of Torment in Chicago; Hex House, Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Fear Experience in Cleveland. \nUNIVERSAL'S HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS \nAt Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida, and Los Angeles, Halloween Horror Nights draw thousands of visitors, ranking among the parks' busiest times of year. The experience is worthy of Hollywood, inspired by famous horror films, sci-fi shows and stories, with movie-quality special effects, technology, sets, costumes and makeup. \nAt Universal Hollywood in Los Angeles, the extravaganza includes a new \"terror tram\" experience through Universal's film studio back lot themed on \"The Purge,\" a film about a 12-hour period in which crime is legal. There are also six themed mazes based on movies and TV shows: The Walking Dead, Insidious, Crimson Peak, Halloween, This Is The End and Alien vs. Predator. Crimson Peak, for example, is inspired by a horror movie being released in mid-October by director Guillermo del Toro, taking visitors on a journey with the main character, Edith Cushing, to a haunted estate in the English countryside. The Walking Dead maze is based on season five of the AMC series. \nUniversal Orlando, which is marking its 25th year of Halloween Horror Nights, has nine haunted houses, including \"Freddy vs. Jason,\"\"The Purge,\"\"An American Werewolf in London\" and \"The Walking Dead.\" The Florida park also has five scare zones. \nBY AMERICAN REGION \nEastern State Penitentiary, the historic former prison in Philadelphia, is celebrating its 25th season hosting Halloween madness. Its massive haunted house, \"Terror Behind the Walls,\" has been redesigned for the anniversary. \nIn Reading, Pennsylvania, Shocktoberfest offers Zombie World and Prison of the Dead Escape, which requires guests to escape from multiple rooms.
