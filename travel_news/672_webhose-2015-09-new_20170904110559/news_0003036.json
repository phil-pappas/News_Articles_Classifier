The airline picks your destination.\nGermanwings, a discount European carrier owned by Lufthansa, offers what it calls “blind booking’’ tickets as cheap as €33 ($37) each way. You pick your dates and your interest: party, culture, shopping, sun-and-beach, gay friendly, metropolis or nature. Then Germanwings picks your destination. Once your payment goes through, the confirmation comes with your destination listed. You can book a hotel room then.\nBlind bookings are one way airlines try to generate some excitement and capitalize on the spontaneity and sense of adventure among younger travelers. They are also a clever way to offer dirt cheap fares without making them available to business travelers or other customers willing to pay more, and without any risk of competitors matching the fares.\nIncreasingly airlines try to find ways to market and sell directly to travelers rather than through broad advertising and travel agencies. They send sale prices or discount codes directly to customers through social media, email and other means and get them to book directly with the airline.\nAlaska Airlines runs “Fast Dash’’ sales at 11 a.m. Pacific Time every Wednesday and tips customers off to destinations offered on Twitter.\nLarger airlines try to create fare buzz through more-conventional channels, such as broad emails. American Airlines has sent a weekly email for many years on Tuesdays with cheap prices for last-minute trips that weekend and the following weekend. The airline says the list has 10 million subscribers. Similarly, Southwest Airlines sends a “Click n’ Save’’ email on Tuesdays and occasionally on Fridays with sale fares. Sometimes the emails include promo codes that yield deeper discounts than posted prices, a Southwest spokeswoman says.\nSelling an all-you-can-fly card is another way carriers can collar customers without publishing cheap fares on specific flights. Last month, Brazilian airline Azul, founded by JetBlue founder David Neeleman, began selling 10-day, all-you-can-fly-within-Brazil passes for $299, and 21-day passes for $399 as part of an itinerary that begins and ends in the U.S., either on Azul or partner United Airlines.\nSome strategies are even more hidden. When airlines want to offer prices without tipping off competitors, they post fares that aren’t listed in reservation systems through Priceline and ticket consolidators. Priceline or consolidators can sell a seat at a very low price as long as they don’t identify the airline until after you make the purchase. You know where you’re going, but not who’s taking you there until you get a confirmation.\nFor Germanwings, the cheap prices have been particularly popular with American expats and military families in Germany interested in seeing more of Europe. Jenny Crossen and her husband Bill, posted in Germany with the U.S. Army, heard about the fares from a co-worker. The couple has taken three blind-booking trips as a way to see more of Europe together. Ms. Crossen said the uncertainty was “kind of exciting while you wait for the big reveal.’’\n“I like that you don’t know where you are going until you pay,’’ she said. “We just thought it was kind of cool to let fate decide where you take your weekend.’’\nThey found they could improve the odds for certain destinations by specifying a desired departure time after checking Germanwings’ schedule for desirable flights.The couple has traveled to London, Munich and Barcelona. Munich wasn’t so exciting but they turned it into a visit to Salzburg, Austria. They now pick names of cities they want to visit out of a champagne bucket.\nMs. Crossen said the travel roulette works well in Europe, but she doubts it would work at U.S. airlines. “I’m not sure a lot of people would be excited about going to Bloomington, Ill., or Newport News, Va.,’’ she said.\nGermanwings, which was rocked earlier this year when one of its pilots flew an Airbus A320 into the French Alps killing 150 onboard, says the most frequent blind-booking destinations are Berlin, Vienna and Milan and the most popular categories are metropolis, culture, and sun-and-beach. The fixed price for sun-and-beach is €50 ($56) each way; destinations in other categories are all fixed at €33 ($37) each way. Last year, the airline sold 90,000 blind-booking tickets; about 60% of them went to couples.\nBlind bookings were conceived in 2007 by a university student who did a thesis on ways airlines could get more fliers without cannibalizing higher-fare ticket sales. Often when an airline launches a sale, business travelers take advantage of discounts. The student’s work included an internship at Germanwings, and his idea focused on student travel habits.\n“Students ask, Where could we go without paying much? They don’t care where they go, just choose,’’ said Oliver Scheid, head of revenue management and pricing at Germanwings.\nThe airline hired the student, but he has since left the company and Germanwings declined to provide his name.\nCustomers can pay €5 ($5.60) to block a destination, and they can block as many as they want as long as there are at least three left. If you exclude a lot of destinations, you end up paying close to the published price. “There has to be a certain amount of chance to it,’’ Mr. Scheid said.\nThe airline offers about 100 destinations through blind bookings. Cities that run full in summer on regular fares rarely come through on blind bookings, such as Barcelona. But Barcelona on weekends is more likely to come through on blind bookings in the winter.\nSince it’s mainly a weekend escape program, business-travel destinations like Zurich often come up in blind bookings. Regular demand for seats to Zurich may be high Monday-Friday, but not so much on weekends. “If you don’t exclude Zurich, chances are very high you’re going to get that,’’ Mr. Scheid said.\nFor now, Germanwings offers blind bookings only on flights out of Germany, but you can buy from anywhere. Many travelers to Europe take advantage by arriving and departing from Germany and using blind bookings to hop around the continent. The airline is thinking about expanding origination of blind-booking trips to other countries, such as the United Kingdom.\nOne drawback to consider: As a discount airline, Germanwings often uses airports farther away from city centers, such as Stansted in London, and checked baggage fees can run as high as €30 ($34) for the first bag and €75 ($84) for the second.\nAbout 45 days before a flight departs, Germanwings’ pricing system has a fairly accurate forecast of how the flight is filling up, and that’s when blind bookings are opened up.\nDeals can be had even one day before departure. Taige Zhang, who went to school in Canada and the U.S. and now works as a product manager for a company in Berlin, decided to head for sun one weekend. He paid to cross off a few places and his ticket to Corsica for a next-day departure was still close to €100 ($113) round trip. “It’s a little bit fun and at the same time a little bit scary,’’ he said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.marketwatch.com/mw2/mediarss/wsj/iphone.asp&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://www.wsj.com/video/want-cheap-airfares-let-the-airline-plan-your-trip/22C7467D-D593-474D-B964-9FE28E87CFD2.html&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;The", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fAAdTjve%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fAAdSyq8.img&description=Getty+Images", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAe4xdt.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB42RJi&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Fear", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAe4rTM.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA28Nb&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;durationSecs&quot;:70,&quot;playbackUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/adventuretravel/heres-how-to-buy-nfl-tickets-without-breaking-the-bank/vi-AAe9mkd&quot;,&quot;providerId&quot;:&quot;TheStreet_Video_ENUS_13284327&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAe9uDO.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;travel-adventure-travel&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAdSFYL.img&quot;}}", "http://online.wsj.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA42cl9.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Here&#39;s"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T14:33:48.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
