The Salween is only navigable for larger vessels for about 100 miles between its mouth at Martaban and the Karen hill station of Hpa-an. However, there is much to explore in this undiscovered area of Burma: Moulmein, the first British capital of Burma, with some fascinating old churches and splendid royal Buddhist monasteries; the war graves at Thanbyuzayat; beautiful scenery and charming undiscovered villages; the Karen capital of Hpaan and the dramatic Mount Zwekabin with its Karen dancing school. Plus, Pandaw guests will stop at the Golden Rock Pagoda of Kyaikhtiho and Pegu with its splendid Shwemadaw Pagoda, the tallest in Burma.\nThe Kalay Pandaw, with her ultra-low draft, is the ideal luxury vessel to explore the Salween River. She has four main deck staterooms, an upper deck owner’s suite and dining room.\nSource:- Pandaw River Cruise", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:03:09.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
