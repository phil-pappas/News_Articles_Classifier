Zuckerberg reportedly once said: \"I want to stress the importance of being young and technical. Young people are just smarter. Why are most chess masters under 30?\" Though chess champions do tend to be young - the current master is 24-year-old Magnus Carlsen - research has suggested that the age at which people produce their most notable inventions is steadily increasing. In ' Age and Great Invention ' Benjamin Jones found that, at the time, 54 per cent of innovations came about when the creators were older than 40 and only 7 per of inventors had a \"great achievement\" at or before the age of 26. Here, we round up some of the most important, and innovative, over 50s around Barbara Knickerbocker-Beskind Photo: YouTube At 91-years-old, Barbara Knickerbocker-Beskind recently became Silicon Valley 's oldest designer. Internationally recognised in the field of occupational therapy, (she opened American's first free-standing occupational therapy clinic in 1966), Beskind now works at IDEO, a consulting firm known for designing the first Apple mouse. She got the job after she sent a letter to the IDEO Foundation, an organisation that calls for social impact in design. Now, she is an adviser for equipment and services for the elderly and low-vision community. With several patents under her belt, including one for inflatable therapeutic equipment, designed to help children improve their balance, Beskind says she's become something like an orange for her younger coworkers: \"I love working in this atmosphere. I may be six or seven decades older, but my voice is respected for what I bring to the table, for my experience, for my insights, and for my inventive, problem-solving nature.\" John Goodenough In 1980, the lithium-ion battery was invented, opening up a whole new range of possibilities for rechargeable battery systems. Without that battery we would not have the technology we have today, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops. John Goodenough, the man widely credited for the identification and development of that battery is now 92-years-old, and still inventing. Speaking to Quartz , he revealed that he still \"goes to his smallish office every day at the University of Texas at Austin.\" The reason, he says, is because he's not \"finished\". He believes the world needs a \"super-battery for electric cars that will let them compete price-wise with gas guzzlers.\" Without this new technology he fears the worst: the world will soon beging warring for the last reserves of oil while we simultaneously suffer from the effect of climate change. \"I'm only 92,\" he says, \"I still have time to go.\" Lonnie G. Johnson Best known for giving children all over the world hours of fun during the summer months with his creation of the super soaker water gun , Lonnie G. Johnson is on a mission to save the world. Since creating the super soaker in 1990, Johnson, now 65, focuses his time and energy on attempting to create renewable and efficient energy sources. One of his companies, 'Johnson Electro-Mechanical Systems (JEMS)' created the 'Johnson Thermo-Electrochemical Converter System (JTEC)', a system that was named as one of the top 10 inventions of 2009. 'JTEC' converts thermal energy into electrical energy and is said to have numerous potential uses in solar plants and ocean thermal power generation. As well as a career in renewable energy, Johnson has also worked on NASA's Galileo mission to Jupiter and, most recently, worked with scientists at Tulane and Tuskegee university to develop a method of transforming heat into electricity with the goal of making green energy more affordable. Ajay Bhatt Currently, he holds 31 US patents to his name, by Ajay Bhatt is most widely known as the co-inventor of the USB . At 58, Bhatt is a chief architect at Intel, responsible for platform directions, and is therefore leading the definition and development of the next-generation of platform architecture at the company. He has been named by GQ as one of \"The 50 Most Influential Global Indians\" and won the \"Outstanding Achievement in Science & Technology Award\" in 2013. Kia Silverbrook Dubbed 'the most prolific inventor in the world', 57-year-old Australian inventor Kia Silverbrook has been granted over 4600 US patents and close to 10,000 international ones. His products span across a wide range of disciplines, including computer graphics, digital printing, LCDs, 3D printing and interactive paper. In 2007, when he revealed his Memjet printer, the technology behind some of the fastest colour printers in the world, the technology used was deemed to be so revolutionaey, many though it was a hoax. @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T09:18:10.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
