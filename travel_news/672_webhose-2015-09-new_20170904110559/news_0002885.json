We will picture a contrast of shopping avenues from Devaraja market to Devaraj Urs road to latest malls in Mysuru and world class accommodation like Lalit Mahal Palace hotel. We will also be showcasing Mysuru pak to Mysuru betel leaves. Also we will be featuring the art, culture and tradition of Mysuru and Mysuru Painting, Yoga, traditional dances including Bharathnatyam, folk dances like Kamsale,” Kerala based Director Mr Ali Ellil said.\nWhile the shoot for the movie began on Tuesday, they plan to launch it on 27th of this month. The movies will be released in several versions, lasting five minutes, two minutes and 30, 20 and ten seconds. Mysuru is the the top 1 tourist destination in the entire State, but lags behind other places in the country. It lacks marketing of its tourism potential and promotional movie with professional touch.\n\"Foreign tourists are declining trend since past three years.
