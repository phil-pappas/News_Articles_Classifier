Commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2015 , Ardmore intends to pay a dividend of 60% of Earnings from Continuing Operations. The remainder of earnings retained by the Company will be deployed to create additional value for shareholders through investment in fleet growth, opportunistic share repurchases under existing and future programs, debt reduction and other corporate purposes.\nThe Company expects the change in policy to result in an estimated dividend of $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 2015, representing a 200% increase from the existing dividend policy. The Company intends that the third quarter 2015 dividend, and all subsequent dividends, will be announced with the release of quarterly financial results.\nAnthony Gurnee , CEO of Ardmore, commented: \"We are pleased to increase our dividend for the benefit of shareholders. The strengthening charter market and our well-timed fleet expansion are resulting in significant growth in Ardmore's earnings and cash flow, allowing us to increase the return of capital to shareholders while also maintaining the ability to pursue other value-enhancing initiatives. The significant dividend increase at a 60% payout ratio underscores the extent of Ardmore's earnings power and the value of our operating efficiency, which we have worked hard to create.\"\nMr. Gurnee continued, \"By linking our dividend payments to our Earnings from Continued Operations at a constant payout ratio, we are also providing investors with clear visibility on future dividends. Following delivery of our remaining two newbuildings by November of 2015, we believe we will be well positioned to further enhance our earnings potential and create additional value for shareholders.\"\nEarnings from Continuing Operations will be defined as Earnings per share (\"EPS\") reported under US GAAP as adjusted for unrealized and realized gains and losses and extraordinary items.\nArdmore's dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") will remain in place to continue to provide shareholders the opportunity to efficiently reinvest in the Company.
