This makes them more likely to be involved in the organisation of a new edition of the association’s conference and thus very important contacts to identify for ICCA members.\nThis process initially identified approximately 15,000 high-potential local meeting ambassadors. Since then, new meetings, mainly taking place in 2014 and confirmed for the future, have been added to the ICCA Association Database by ICCA’s Research Department. The additional 10,000 academics have been identified based on association and conference websites of these newly identified meetings.\nICCA CEO Martin Sirk: “By automating the research to see if high-profile academics, as identified with our Big Data Search tool, are actually active with an association and its meetings, we create a shortcut for ICCA members to identify suitable local meeting ambassadors. This should save our members a lot of research time.”\nSource:-ICCA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T18:04:22.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
