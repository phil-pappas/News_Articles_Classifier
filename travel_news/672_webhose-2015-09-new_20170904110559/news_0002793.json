While we can’t promise a free vacation in the Caribbean, there are plenty of islands dishing up free (or very nearly free) things to do. Apart from going to the beach that generally comes without a cost and sunset-watching that is always on the house, there are also a host of activities that don’t cost a dime to experience. Check out our list of the top 10, from cycling along a centuries-old railway trail and hiking through the mountains to exploring an underwater sculpture garden and tours in distilleries that come with gratis samples. \nCuracao Informative and entertaining, the best part of the Blue Curacao factory tour is the generous (and free) samples of the blue liqueur. (Photo: curacaoliqueur.com) \nIt’s what adds that familiar neon-blue color to many of our favorite cocktails. The only liqueur in the world made from the dried peels of the bitter Laraha oranges (a relative of the orange brought by the Spanish in the sixteenth century), Blue Curacao is one of the islands natural treasures. Made in the maize yellow plantation mansion called Landhuis Chobolobo for more than a century, free tours of the family-run distillery near Fort Amsterdam in the capital city of Willemstad are offered Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Informative and entertaining, the best part of the tour is the generous (and free) samples of the blue liqueur. You’ll also get to try samples of the other varieties colored in red, green and orange and the premium line flavored with coffee, chocolate and rum raisin. The open-air Chobolobo Café is fun with a menu of liqueur-inspired food and cocktails and the gift shop stocks a big selection of bottles in all sizes and flavors. \nBermuda Today, the trail is maintained by the Bermuda Parks Department with 18 of the railway’s original 22 miles accessible to the public. Divided into nine sections, the terrain varies from flat and paved to stretches with steeper slopes and bridges that make cycling more challenging. (Photo: Bermuda Tourism Authority) \nVenture off-the-beaten path along Bermuda’s un-touristy Railway Trail . Spanning the island from end to end, the trail — which doesn’t have an entry fee — follows an abandoned rail bed that winds along the rocky coastlines passing old forts, mangroves and bridges. Since no cars were allowed on the island until 1946, the once-busy transit line is a fabled one, with origins going back to when the Bermuda Railway (or the “Old Rattle and Shake,” as locals called it), chugged along from 1931 to 1948 from St. George’s Station in the east to Somerset Station in the west. In 1964, the remaining right of way was transformed into a trail for walkers and cyclists and designated as a National Park in 1986. Today, the trail is maintained by the Bermuda Parks Department with 18 of the railway’s original 22 miles accessible to the public. Divided into nine sections, the terrain varies from flat and paved to stretches with steeper slopes and bridges that make cycling more challenging. “The water along the shoreline is so clear that you can see schools of fish gather in the shallows,” smiles Pat Phillip-Fairn, Chief Product and Experiences Officer of the Bermuda Tourism Authority , “you’re immediately surrounded by bursts of color and fragrant scents; our natural beauty is right at your feet and fingertips.” A free Railway Trail Guide is available from the Visitor Information Center at the Royal Naval Dockyard in Hamilton or St. George’s. \nJamaica Open banking hours are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., where free guided tours in the museum cash in on the island’s money history with exhibits of tokens, coins and paper bills. (Photo: Jamaica Money Museum) \nYou’d think a museum about money would charge a few bucks to get in, but that’s not the case at the National Coin and Currency Museum in the Bank of Jamaica. On Nethersole Place in Kingston near the picturesque waterfront, the bank is the tallest building in the capital city. Open banking hours are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., where free guided tours in the museum cash in on the island’s money history with exhibits of tokens, coins and paper bills. Unique currency like glass beads that were used by the Taino Indians — Jamaica’s first inhabitants — and gold brought to the island by the Spanish are also on display. Ultraviolet lights in the secured cabinets make for easy viewing of the fine print on the old bank notes. Exhibits detailing counterfeiting techniques and the best ways to protect paper bills are worth a look-see as is the international currency section showcasing everything from pounds and shillings to pence and dollars. \nTrinidad Manicured with a meticulous lattice of walkways, flowers and trees — some indigenous to Trinidad and Tobago and others collected from around the globe — the gardens are a peaceful respite from the hustle-bustle of the city. (Photo: Trinidad and Tobago Tourism Development Company) \nNorth of the capital city of Port of Spain, you can spend the entire day exploring the Royal Botanic Gardens of Trinidad and Tobago and not shell out a cent. On the same site as the President’s and Prime Minister’s official residences and the Emperor Valley Zoo, the Gardens opened in 1818 and are the oldest in the West Indies. Manicured with a meticulous lattice of walkways, flowers and trees — some indigenous to Trinidad and Tobago and others collected from around the globe — the gardens are a peaceful respite from the hustle-bustle of the city. For serious botanists, check out the name tags on many of the 700 trees noting the age of the tree. The 61-acre garden is fun for kids who like to roll around in the grass while the grown-ups snack and chat at picnic tables. For those without a rental car, buses depart from the City Gate in Port of Spain from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. \nAruba Guided tours are offered every 15 minutes from Monday to Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon, and are conducted in English, Dutch, Spanish and Papiamento (Aruba’s native language). (Photo: Aruba Tourism Authority) \nTall green gooey plants grow all over the Caribbean and for many; a slather of aloe is a soothing rite of passage after a day in the sun. To find out how that gel is made, take a free tour at the Aruba Aloe Factory , where guides offer an enlightening ‘Aloe 101’ lesson explaining the production process from leaf to lotion. The tour takes aloe fans to the testing lab and also the factory where the plants are filleted, packaged and stored. Guided tours are offered every 15 minutes from Monday to Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon, and are conducted in English, Dutch, Spanish and Papiamento (Aruba’s native language). Convenient for tourists, the factory in the Hato Plantation is close to the hotel strip in Oranjestad. On your way out, peruse the store with its big selection of everything-aloe from creams, lotions and hair care products to soap and bath gels. Three-ounce sizes of most products are available for happy travels back home. \nBritish Virgin Islands As a result of the molten rock seeping into the volcanic rock layers, the boulders have uniquely rounded corners. (Photo: British Virgin Islands Tourist Board) \nPretty as a picture on the southwestern tip of Virgin Gorda, the geological wonder called The Baths are nearly free to explore with an entry fee of just USD$3.00 for adults and USD$2.00 for kids. Mesmerizing at forty feet in diameter, the granite boulders form sea pools right at the beach’s edge. As a result of the molten rock seeping into the volcanic rock layers, the boulders have uniquely rounded corners. A series of ladders lead to Devil’s Bay for a lazy afternoon of snorkeling and swimming in the warm rock pools. A dock offshore keeps the beach from getting too crowded with dinghies and with onshore lockers and bathrooms, lazing by the grottoes and granite is the must-do in the BVI archipelago. \nSt. Maarten Within walking distance of the Princess Juliana International Airport, the beach is legendary for the up-close-and-personal views of the planes; so close in fact that avid watchers claim to see the pilots in the cockpits. (Photo: Sunset Bar) \nYou can spend a lot of cash duty-free shopping on Front Street and tempting Lady Luck at the casinos, but you can also enjoy a few freebies on the Dutch side of the dual-country island. No tickets are required for the best show in town on Maho Beach, where big jets and small planes take off and come in for a landing just a few feet above the waves. Within walking distance of the Princess Juliana International Airport, the beach is legendary for the up-close-and-personal views of the planes; so close in fact that avid watchers claim to see the pilots in the cockpits. A blackboard on the beach keeps plane spotters informed about airline schedules. Note to diehards: the really big jets from Europe arrive and take-off in the afternoon. For ringside seats, snag a bar stool at the Sunset Beach Bar , where the Runway Rum Punch is the crowd-pleaser and the overhead aircraft the grand finale. For a free taste of the national liqueur, head to the Guavaberry Emporium near the pier in Philipsburg where the staff in the cute clapboard house offer tastings of the flavored liqueurs and fiery hot sauces made from the red berry that grows on the island . \nBarbados Named after the sea anemones (the small aquatic animals that look like flowers) who live around it, the spectacular spot is Barbados’ only accessible sea cave and is free to explore. (Photo: barbados.org) \nAt the far north tip where the Atlantic crashes against the North Point cliffs, Animal Flower Cave is as hauntingly beautiful as it looks in the guidebooks. Named after the sea anemones (the small aquatic animals that look like flowers) who live around it, the spectacular spot is Barbados’ only accessible sea cave. Although it’s not as popular as touristy Harrison’s Cave, which charges an admission fee, Animal Flower Cave is free to discover. Some of the tidal pools are deep enough for a refreshing dip while the cliffs appeal to the brazen who say jumping off is the single most awesome thing to do in Barbados. Inside the cave, the walls are full of curious formations that have been colored brown and green by the oxidation of copper and iron. Wear comfy shoes (no flip-flops) to make the trek down the steep stairs to peek out at the sea through various openings in the cave walls and bring a few Barbadian bucks for a cutter (a tasty local sandwich made with salt bread) in the clifftop restaurant. As a fun fact for music trivia fans, Billy Ocean filmed his 2013 hit The Color of Love here by the caves. \nPuerto Rico The forest’s 2,800 acres are home to one thousand animal and plant species and with well-marked trails and railings to hang on to, even novice hikers can do it. (Photo: Puerto Rico Tourism Company) \nOn the northeast corner in the Luquillo Mountains, El Yunque is the only tropical rain forest managed by the US Forest Service. The forest’s 2,800 acres are home to one thousand animal and plant species and with well-marked trails and railings to hang on to, even novice hikers can do it. Ideal for a family adventure, El Yunque is a gentle forest with no poisonous snakes or big cats and plenty of refreshing waterfalls and mighty mountain vistas. There are no entrance fees to visit the forest, but if you stop at the interactive El Portal Visitors Center, it’ll cost $4.00 per person (free for kids). Highly recommended although not necessary, a $5.00 donation is appreciated for the one-hour guided tour offered only on Wednesdays. If you’re not the outdoorsy type, spend the afternoon instead at Casa Bacardi in San Juan, where both the interactive tour of the factory and rum shot samples are free. Open Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. \nGrenada \nA visual stunner below the waves, ‘Nutmeg Princess’ is the latest addition to the world’s first and only Underwater Sculpture Park at Moliniere Bay, just north of Grenada’s capital of St. George’s. In the Marine Protected Area on the southwest coast, the 11-foot-tall beauty joins one hundred other sculptures standing proud on the ocean floor which add to the artificial reef that boosts marine life. A pass from the Fisheries Department — one US dollar for snorkelers and two dollars for divers — is necessary to view the underwater installation. When a tour is booked with dive shops or tour operators, the fee is included. Visible to snorkelers, divers and those viewing from a glass-bottom boat, The Nutmeg Princess sculpture depicts the fairy tale princess emerging from a large nutmeg pod with a handful of the island’s favorite spice. A true original, it was designed by Norwegian artist Lene Kilde and inspired by the 1992 book of the same name written by hometown hero Richardo Keens-Douglas. “Seeing the sculpture descend into the water made me feel like a child reading the book all over again,” said Richardo Keens-Douglas at the July opening, “it is an honor to know that something so Grenadian and so enchanting now has a home at a beautiful underwater park.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T04:50:40.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
