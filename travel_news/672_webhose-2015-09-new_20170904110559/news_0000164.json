The court also ordered Sanral to review its plans for the highways.\nIn addition, the court said if Sanral wanted to proceed with the project it had to start from scratch and conduct a process that was supported by proper public participation.\nThe City of Cape Town had approached the court and accused Sanral of not having followed due process when the roads agency decided it would toll the N1 and N2 in the Winelands.\nSanral’s plan could have resulted in the tolling of a 180km stretch of highway in the Winelands. The proposed concession route, along the N1, goes from west of the R300 interchange to Sandhills, while the N2 portion extends from west of the R300 to Bot River.\nAccording to the city: the national environmental affairs minister at the time signed off on the project without considering its socioeconomic effects; the transport minister failed to consider the merits and effects of tolling; and Sanral’s board was unable to produce a record of its decision to toll the roads, which suggested that outgoing CE Nazir Alli made the decision alone. This constituted a violation of the Sanral Act, the city said.\nThe city had argued that Western Cape drivers would pay toll tariffs nearly three times higher than those in Gauteng, should the tolling plan go ahead.\nThe projected costs of the project had escalated from R1.653bn in March 2000 to R44.970bn in March 2010 (the 2010 values exclude value-added tax). This is a 2,620% cost estimate spike over 10 years. But this information was not presented to, or considered by, the decision-makers.\nIn August, Sanral’s legal counsel, Bruce Leech, asked the city why it waited nearly four years before mounting the legal challenge. The city began its legal fight in 2011, but the N1 and N2 were declared toll roads in September 2008. Mr Leach said the delay was unreasonable and more than the 180-day period prescribed in the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act.\nThe agency also argued that its funding was limited to two sources: appropriations by Parliament and tolls. It said the appropriations were insufficient to fund highway upgrades when factoring in its other commitments, and it said the fuel levy was not an option.\nThe city said although it had delayed approaching the courts, the judges should weigh this against an \"unlawfully built\" toll project \"that will affect all the people of the city over a period of 30 years\".\nOutside the court building, Sanral project manager Tiago Massingue said the agency was disappointed with the judgment and a detailed statement would be released soon.\nBrett Herron, Cape Town’s mayoral committee member for transport, said on Wednesday the ruling is the city’s second legal victory against Sanral, and should send a strong message that the agency has reached the end of the road as far as the Winelands tolling project is concerned.\n\"The ruling vindicates the city’s firm belief that the process undertaken by Sanral to declare portions of the N1 and N2 as toll roads was improper and unlawful.\n\"It is also high time that Sanral stop blaming the City of Cape Town for neglecting to undertake much-needed road maintenance along the N1 and N2 freeways and upgrades to the Huguenot Tunnel,\" Mr Herron said.\nCommenting on the judgment on Wednesday, Sanral spokesman Vusi Mona said although he was pleased that environmental authorisations regarding the implementation of the project were upheld, he is disappointed that the court set aside the decisions concerning the procedure of the declaration to toll.\nThe agency’s legal team is reviewing the details of the decision and will assess the legal options available to Sanral, said Mr Mona.\nHe said it seemed the city’s real complaint with the N1/N2 Winelands toll project was about using tolling as the funding choice.\nMr Mona pointed out that the Constitutional Court had already ruled that it was not the judiciary that determined what kind of funding should be used and who should bear the brunt of that cost. The remedy lies in the political process.\nHe said the N1/N2 Winelands project was more than a decade in the making. It was conceived to improve the link between the Western Cape and the rest of the country, and substantial time, effort and investment had been put into its development. It was also earmarked to facilitate the movement of large volumes of export and import freight, business, tourism, recreational and commuter traffic.\nThe court’s decision, Mr Mona said, meant that the realisation of the benefits of the project would either be delayed or may never come to fruition.\nThese included safety benefits to road users and the economic benefits to SA and the region.\nIt will also prevent the direct and indirect creation of some 5,000 jobs for the initial construction period over the first three years of the project and thereafter approximately 500 jobs a year for the duration of the 30-year concession period, he said.\n“If Sanral is not allowed to proceed with the project now, the province, the city and their constituents will not have the upgrades for at least the next 20 years, if at all.\n“There is just no money from the Treasury to fund the project. The only option is to have it operated by a concessionaire who will finance the cost of upgrading and expanding the road through equity and borrowings, which have to be repaid through tolls,” Mr Mona said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:43:58.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
