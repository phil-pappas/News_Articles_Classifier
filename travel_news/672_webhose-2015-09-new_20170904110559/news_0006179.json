This means per-liter prices of “Super” and “Plus” gasoline likely will be cheaper for next month, the agency said.\nInternational diesel prices, however, recently showed a slight increase prompted by higher demand and reduced reserves, ARESEP said.\nThe agency noted that the only situation that could result in higher fuel prices is the exchange rate, as the average recorded in August was ₡535.60, while so far this month, it is ₡539.98.\nCheaper fuel prices went into effect last Wednesday following ARESEP’s approval of reductions of ₡44 for “Super” gasoline, ₡39 for “Plus” and ₡28 for diesel.\nContact L.
