The Car Care Council's free personalized schedule and email reminder service is a simple way to help you take better care of your vehicle. Proactive: If you find your vehicle needs repairs, be sure to address them in a timely manner to avoid more extensive work down the road. Before traveling longer distances, perform a pre-trip inspection before your journey begins so you have an opportunity to have any repairs made by a trusted technician before hitting the road. Prepared: Keep an emergency kit in your vehicle in case an unexpected situation arises. The kit should include jumper cables, a road atlas, first-aid kit, flashlight with extra batteries, water, non-perishable food and blankets. Be sure your cell phone is fully charged and order a free copy of the Car Care Council's Car Care Guide for your glove box. \"Emergencies and natural disasters come in a variety of forms. Being car care aware and taking proactive steps in advance will help ensure that your vehicle is in proper working order so you will be better prepared if you encounter a problem while on the road,\" said Rich White , executive director, Car Care Council.\nTo learn about the American Public Health Association's Get Ready program and how to stay safe behind the wheel when a disaster hits, visit http://www.getreadyforflu.org/DrivingDisasters.htm .\nThe Car Care Council is the source of information for the \"Be Car Care Aware\" consumer education campaign promoting the benefits of regular vehicle care, maintenance and repair to consumers.
