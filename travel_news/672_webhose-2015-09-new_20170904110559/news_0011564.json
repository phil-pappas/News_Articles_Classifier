Today’s strike is the 13 th in 18 months.\nVC spokesman Markus Wahl said the airline has not shown any willingness to reach an agreement.\nPilots went on strike more than 10 times last year over Lufthansa’s plans to phase out its early retirement scheme that currently sees pilots retire at 55 and retain around 60% of their pay until they reach the state pension age.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe", "http://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/press/news-releases/singleview/archive/2015/september/07/article/3699.html"], "published": "2015-09-08T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T22:04:40.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
