Transport networks are expected to be busier than normal throughout the tournament. With 4.3 million extra journeys expected across the 44-day event, supporters and locals are being urged to plan ahead. \nRegus’ Twickenham centre at Regal House, 70 London Road will operate its largest available office as a drop-in workspace on Friday 18th September, the day of England’s match against Fiji. All three of Regus’ Cardiff centres: Brunel House, Cardiff Bay and Cardiff Gate Business Park will offer free business lounge access on Wednesday 23rd September (Australia vs Fiji), Thursday 1st October (Wales vs Fiji) and Friday 2nd October (New Zealand vs Georgia). The Regus centre on Exeter Business Park will offer free access to its business lounge on Tuesday 29th September (Tonga vs Namibia) and Wednesday 7th October (Namibia vs Georgia). Workers will be able to drop-in and use the workspace for free on match days, taking advantage of the professional set-up including complimentary wifi. Locals looking to avoid travelling around affected areas, as well as fans keen to make sure they are home in time to watch the matches, are expected to take advantage of the offer. Richard Morris, UK CEO at Regus comments: “It’s been well publicised that transport networks in and around the world cup venues are going to be more congested than normal as thousands travel to matches. Working in a professional location closer to home can provide a solution for local workers, enabling them to avoid difficult and lengthy commutes and ensuring they make it home in time for the game. “Employers in and around the Twickenham, Cardiff and Exeter areas may find that letting their staff work from more convenient locations on match day could lead them to reassess their attitude towards the fixed workplace in the future. Just some of the reported benefits of flexible working include happier and more motivated staff, which in turn lead to productivity gains for employers.” Flexible working is on the rise in the UK, with 40% of UK workers spending at least 2.5 days per week working outside of their main office. Regus is experiencing month-on-month growth in Businessworld membership, as employers turn to part-time and drop-in workspace to accommodate a distributed workforce.
