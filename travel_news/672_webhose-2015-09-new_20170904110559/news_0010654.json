Garvison wrote about her gratitude to a woman who happened to be sitting next to her on the plane. \n\"Something amazing happened to me today and I will never be able to express how grateful I am for it.\" Garvison posted. \n\"If anyone has ever travelled with an infant you know how stressful it can be. Today, I was reminded that there truly are absolutely AMAZING individuals in this world even if they are complete strangers to you.\" \nGarvison went onto explain how she was already stressed about travelling alone with her baby before she took flight, and her fears were founded once she boarded the plane. As she went to take her seat, she noticed a couple \"looking very annoyed\" so when her daughter started crying, she asked if she could be moved to two empty seats next to each other. Ad Feedback \nWhat happened next was truly touching. \n\"Next thing I know I was sitting next to this amazing woman! I'm not sure if she could tell how stressed and upset I looked or what, but she turned our day completely around. Rylee wouldn't stop crying no matter what I would try and do....so she had asked if I didn't mind if she tried and of course I let her.\" Garvison wrote. \n\"As soon as she had her, Rylee was looking out the window and stopped crying. When we got in the air she fell right asleep and slept in her lap the whole flight until we got to our gate. She kept saying it wasn't a problem at all and it was actually a comforting feeling for her. She even carried her off the plane and held her so I could get the stroller and carseat put back together so I wasn't struggling to try and do it all alone.\" \nThe woman sitting next to Garvison was Nyfesha Miller . \nBoth women left the flight as strangers, but since Garvison posted her message to Facebook it has been shared over 80,000 times, and Miller was just as grateful for their meeting. \n\"Hard to believe how this has become a trending story, turned viral!....So unexpectedly, unbelievable! Huge thanks to every single person for your kind words and posts! Extra special thanks to new mommy & military wife, Rebekka Garvison , who I had the honour, privilege & blessing to meet and assist. She's truly a sweet, loving mommy & wife, who deserves all the accolades. God Bless you all!!\" Miller wrote on Facebook. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T08:51:20.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
