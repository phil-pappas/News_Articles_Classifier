Tanzania is a host destination for tourists from Southern Africa states. \nThe “Magical Kenya” campaign will as well target Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Uganda, Angola, and Ethiopia, reports from Nairobi said. Kenya is well-connected to those key African states through her national airline, Kenya Airways. \nWith its hub in Nairobi, Kenya Airways stands as the leading African air carrier connecting Eastern African states to Central and West African states. Nigeria, South Africa, and Ghana are the leading African tourist source markets for Kenya. \nKenya will also target emerging markets of China, India, and countries from the Gulf such as the United Arab Emirates. \n“The government’s goal is to ensure that tourism recovers as soon as possible to help create jobs, foreign exchange, and economic growth,” said Kenyan Tourism Minister, Phyllis Kandie. \nKenya, through the campaign to be launched this month, will also target emerging markets of China, India, and countries from the Gulf such as the United Arab Emirates. \nDuring his recent visit to Kenya, the UNWTO Secretary General, Dr. Taleb Rifai, said he was confident with the security situation in Kenya and was looking to see this African safari destination making great strides in tourism. \n“I am confident of the Kenyan destination. I can even bring my family tomorrow,” he said. \nMarketing her rich tourism as “Magical Kenya,” this African safari destination offers an abundance of wildlife opportunities, as well as an astonishing diversity of landscapes and cultures. \nKenya is the founding member of the Africa Travel Association, while the Kenyan government shares a special connection with ATA. The first ATA Congress in Africa was hosted in Kenya in 1976, and the Kenyan government has fostered a tradition of hosting the ATA Congress every ten years. \n“Our partnership with ATA is very important as the United States of America remains a significant source market for Kenya. The Kenya tourism industry is looking forward to welcoming ATA delegates for a successful conference in November to highlight all the country has to offer,” said Hon. Kandie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:58:00.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
