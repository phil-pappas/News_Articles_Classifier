There’s something immensely rewarding about hours of driving the open road. There can also be a lot of monotony. A great playlist and some stellar audio books will only get you so far. \nWhy not resurrect an old-school car game or two. You know, the kind we all used to play before messing around on our phones and tablets became the national pastime. \nHere are a few oldies but goodies to keep you from getting bored and keep your brain alert on the road. \nRelated: Pacific Coast Highway — The Ultimate California Road Trip \n(Photo: Getty Images) \nThe Spelling Bee: What is more fun than a good old-fashioned spelling bee? You can choose to integrate technology or just bring along a dictionary. They still sell them in most bookstores. I promise. Divide into teams or make it every man for himself. You can play single or double elimination, and the winner gets to choose where to stop for the next snack. \n(Photo: Stocksy) \nTell Me a Story: This one is really team storytelling, and it’s a great way to get the creative juices rocking. One person starts by introducing the first line of a story. Then each passenger adds a line or a whole paragraph. Write it down for posterity if you want, or get all techy and record it to listen to later. You’ll be amazed at what you come up with. \n(Photo: Stocksy) \nTwenty Questions: One person thinks of an object, and the others playing have 20 chances to guess what it is. A great game for long, boring car trips, study halls, or as a vocabulary expansion game for language learners. \nHow many license plates can you find? (Photo: Getty Images) \nThe License Plate Game: This game benefits from a little bit of advance planning. Make a list of all 50 states and print it out prior to the trip. The first person to spot a license plate wins the state. The one who gets the most states wins. Want to make it more competitive? You can give bonus points for obscure states like Alaska and Hawaii. \nRelated: 15 Apps for the Best Road Trip of Your Life \n(Photo: Getty Images) \nBingo: Yet another game that requires a little planning, but it’s totally worth it. Make bingo cards filled with typical road trip places and objects — fast food restaurants, kinds of cars, landmarks. You can even make them reusable by laminating them and using nonpermanent markers. \nMake sure to point out the license plates you add up (Photo: Getty Images) \nAdd It Up: Calling all math geeks. For this one you call out the numbers on the license plate of the car in front of you and see who can (correctly) add them up first. \nThe statue game comes in handy when kids get restless (Photo: Getty Images) \nStatue: This is the greatest game ever for exhausted parents. The child who stays very still and quiet the longest wins! Let’s be honest — everyone wins with this game. \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
