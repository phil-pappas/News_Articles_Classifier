Their convoy was blocked by some 200 state police officers.\nParents of the students tried to negotiate with the officers, but after the police refused to let them through, some 200 masked students set a soft drink truck that they had seized ablaze and lobbed firebombs. The protesters briefly held two officers.\nThe clash came a day after a group of protesters ransacked the Guerrero state prosecutor’s office in Chilpancingo, breaking furniture and computers.\nA protest is planned for Mexico City on Saturday to mark one year since the 43 students disappeared after they were attacked by police officers in the Guerrero town of Iguala. Prosecutors say the officers delivered the students to the Guerreros Unidos drug gang, which killed them and incinerated their bodies after confusing them with rivals. But independent investigators have contradicted those official conclusions , saying there was no evidence that the young men were burned in a garbage dump.\nSee also: Mexico’s 43 missing students continue to haunt President Peña Nieto – and they should\nFiremen extinguish a blaze during clashes between student teachers from Ayotzinapa and riot police in a tunnel along the Tixtla-Chilpancingo highway in Tixtla, Guerrero State, Mexico, on Sept. 22, 2015.\nYuri Cortéz/AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T10:10:40.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
