If you don't have the time or money to see the real thing, then opt for one of these faux versions of tourists attractions that are often imitated and nearly duplicated.\nLeaning Tower of Pisa replica in Niles, IL\n© Provided by The Huffington Post Leaning Tower is Pisa replica in Niles, Illinois. Credit Jimmy Thomas/Flickr. Italy isn't the only place where you can eat great pizza and take a selfie in front of an off-kilter landmark. At 94 feet tall, this suburban Chicago knockoff stands at about half the size of the actual Italian treasure. Built as a utility tower in 1934, in the late '90s the tower added a fountain, reflection pool and other upgrades just in time for a visit from its sister city, which is--you guessed it--Pisa, Italy.\nTrevi Fountain replica in Las Vegas, NV\n© Provided by The Huffington Post Trevi Fountain replica at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Credit Bert Kaufmann/Flickr. What happens in Vegas... originally happened in Rome, Italy. Sin City is home to several clones of the Baroque masterpiece. The best-known sits outside Caesars Palace, where you can dine at--wait for it--Trevi Italian Restaurant. There's also a lesser-known version of the ornate fountain inside the Fendi boutique at Crystals at CityCenter, where the handbags are legit but the fountain is most definitely a knockoff.\nStatue of Liberty replica in Birmingham, AL\n© Provided by The Huffington Post Statue of Liberty replica in Birmingham, Alabama. Credit Wikipedia. About 2 million tourists flock to Ellis Island each year. Skip the lines and ferry ride by heading south to this bronze duplicate that's one-fifth the size of the real statue. Like the New York statue, Birmingham's version of Lady Liberty was made in France and has a continuously burning flame. In 1958, businessman Frank Park Samford commissioned the clone to sit atop the building of his company, Liberty National Life Insurance. Today, the statue stands in Liberty Park.\nWhite House replica in McClean, VA\nYou can't buy an election, but you can buy the White House--or at least a private home just outside Washington, DC, that's modeled after the real thing. The 15,000-square-foot replica has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms, compared to the actual White House's 55,000 square feet, 16 bedrooms and 35 bathrooms. In 2012, the foreclosured property sold for just $865,000.\nEiffel Tower replica in Paris, TX\n© Provided by The Huffington Post Eiffel Tower replica in Paris, Texas. Credit Kevin/Flickr. Not everything's bigger in Texas. This iron structure stands at 65 feet tall, compared to the French icon, which boasts a staggering 986 feet. But the Texas version is topped with a giant red cowboy hat, which makes for a kitschy photo op as you stretch your legs along U.S. Highway 82. The Boiler Makers Local #902 in built it there in 1995, more than a century after the French landmark was erected.\nParthenon replica in Nashville, TN\n© Provided by The Huffington Post Parthenon replica in Nashville. Credit Will Powell/Flickr. This Southern gem was built for Tennessee's 1897 Centennial Exposition--which sounds old, until you realize that construction on the actual Parthenon in Greece began in 447 BC. But Nashville's full-scale replica is more than just a pretty facade; it also houses the city's art museum.\nStonehedge replica in Maryhill, WA\n© Provided by The Huffington Post Stonehenge replica. Credit Wikipedia. While the purpose behind England's Stonehenge remain a mystery--altar? astronomical observatory? burial site?--the origins of this knockoff are more certain. In 1918, land developer Sam Hill erected his version of Stonehenge as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of World War 1. The Druids used actual stones, but 5,000 years later, Hill opted for the convenience of reinforced concrete slabs.\n© Gregory Olsen via Getty Images UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON CAMPUS Related: 5 stunning U.S. scenic drives\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618", "http://www.cheaptickets.com/travel-guide/United_States--WA/Seattle.tg24746/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBmab1a%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBmalmq.img&description=Eiffel+Tower+replica+in+Paris%2c+Texas.+Credit+Kevin%2fFlickr.+-+Provided+by+The+Huffington+Post", "http://www.cheaptickets.com/travel-guide/United_States--NV/Las_Vegas.tg17134/", "http://www.cheaptickets.com/blog/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBmab1a%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBmayre.img&description=UNIVERSITY+OF+WASHINGTON+CAMPUS+-+Gregory+Olsen+via+Getty+Images", "http://www.cheaptickets.com/blog/2015/05/5-u-s-scenic-drives-that-prove-getting-there-is-half-the-fun/", "http://www.cheaptickets.com/hotels/United_States--TN/Nashville.hd22300/", "http://www.cheaptickets.com/hotels/United_States--AL/Birmingham.hd2597/", "http://www.cheaptickets.com/hotels/United_States--DC/Washington_DC.hd5091/", "http://www.cheaptickets.com/hotels/United_States--Texas.hd346/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBmab1a%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBmayrc.img&description=Stonehenge+replica.+Credit+Wikipedia.+-+Provided+by+The+Huffington+Post", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBmab1a%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBmalms.img&description=Parthenon+replica+in+Nashville.+Credit+Will+Powell%2fFlickr.+-+Provided+by+The+Huffington+Post", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBmab1a%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBmaDCj.img&description=Trevi+Fountain+replica+at+Caesars+Palace+in+Las+Vegas.+Credit+Bert+Kaufmann%2fFlickr.+-+Provided+by+The+Huffington+Post", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBmab1a%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBmaqHI.img&description=Leaning+Tower+is+Pisa+replica+in+Niles%2c+Illinois.+Credit+Jimmy+Thomas%2fFlickr.+-+Provided+by+The+Huffington+Post", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.msn.com%2f03%2fen-us%2fBBmab1a%3focid%3dsp&media=http%3a%2f%2fimg-s-msn-com.akamaized.net%2ftenant%2famp%2fentityid%2fBBmayr6.img&description=Statue+of+Liberty+replica+in+Birmingham%2c+Alabama.+Credit+Wikipedia.+-+Provided+by+The+Huffington+Post"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T20:24:15.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
