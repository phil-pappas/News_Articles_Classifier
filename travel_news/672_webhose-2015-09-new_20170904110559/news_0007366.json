This is really just a first look – I wasn’t able to test it out in real-world conditions but I did like what I saw.Samsung will be selling two models: the Gear S2 and the Gear S2 classic. The S2 is Samsung’s answer to the Apple Watch Sport while the S2 classic is closer to what Samsung calls a “timeless watch design” with a black finish, leather band and ability to accommodate standard 20 mm watch bands. Samsung didn’t announce pricing for either model but both are expected to be available in October. The Classic, which is slightly thinner and lighter, is likely to be more expensive than the standard edition. Works with most Android phones One of the biggest differences between these watches and previous Samsung models is that they are designed to work with most Android phones rather than just some Samsung phones, as long as the phone uses standard Android APIs (application programming interface). But to use the watch’s Samsung Pay feature you will need a compatible Samsung phone.As soon as I strapped on the standard Gear 2, I noticed that the band – while plastic and far from breathtaking, had a standard buckle which means – unlike some smart watches – it’s likely to stay on your wrist. I also found the watch to be light weight and about the right size for a wrist watch. A rotating bezel and other hardware specs These are round watches and the circular shape isn’t just for looks. It enabled Samsung to offer a rotating bezel as an important part of the watches’ user interface – it’s Samsung’s version of Apple’s watch crown which serves as a navigation tool, helping to compensate for the small screen.If you turn the bezel to the left, you scroll through your notifications. If you turn it to the right, you can select which app to use. There is also a home button and a back button to make it easier to return to the main screen.Like most smart watches there are a variety of both digital and analog faces but, unlike Apple whose deceased co-founder Steve Jobs was on Disney’s board, there is no Mickey Mouse face. The watch display is 1.2” round super AMOLED at 360×360, 302pp. It comes with 4 GB of internal storage. Sensors include an a ccelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate, ambient light, and a barometer. The watches use the most recent Tizen OS and have a 1-GHz dual core processor. The standard watch is .45 inches thick and weighs 1.66 ounces. Full specifications from Samsung are at the end of this post. Bluetooth, NFC and optional 3G Both versions of the watch have Bluetooth to connect to phones and other devices and NFC for mobile payments. Samsung will also offer a version of the standard watch (not the classic) with a 3G “e-SIM” card that can be used as a standalone device with its own connection to the Internet and the ability to make and receive calls.Both models will allow you to send and receive text messages and, of course, get notifications about incoming calls, texts, emails and other alerts. Continuous heart rate monitoring The watch has continuous heart rate monitoring and comes with Samsung’s S Health app that logs your activity progress and sends reminders when it’s time to get up and move. The watch can sense whether you’re waling, running or cycling so you don’t have to put it into any special mode to track your activity.[caption id=\"attachment_8968\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Gear 2 has continuous heart rate monitoring (photo: Larry Magid)[/caption] Battery and charging Samsung said that the battery will last two to three days, though I didn't have access to the watch long enough to test that. Apple rates its watch battery for one day though some users have reported longer battery life. The watch comes with a wireless charging doc. There is no need to plug-in a cable into the watch itself.The standard Gear S2 will be available in a dark gray case with a dark Gray band and silver case with a white band. The Gear S2 classic will have a black case with a black leather band.[caption id=\"attachment_8971\" align=\"\" width=\"650\"] Gear 2 on charging stand (photo: Larry Magid)[/caption] Overall impressions Based on my brief time with the watch, I liked what I saw and believe that Samsung has a viable competitor to the Apple Watch with some caveats.Though I think it's reasonably attractive, it doesn't look as distinct or luxurious as the Apple watch (even the sport model), which stands out among all the other smart watches on the market. But I do think it's easier to learn to use than Apple's relatively complicated watch and I love the fact that it works with most Android phones while the Apple Watch only works on iPhones. However, if you're an iPhone owners, the Gear S2 will be of little interest since it doesn't work with iOS devices.
