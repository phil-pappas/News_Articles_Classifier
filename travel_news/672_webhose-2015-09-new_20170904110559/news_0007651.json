The Chameleon is the first customizable electric scooter programmed by the rider using Daymak My Ebike application.\nDesigned and developed by Daymak, the Chameleon features My Ebike Application, which runs on Bluetooth on IPHONE or Android. The Chameleon's main features include a strong 84V battery pack, programmable LED lights and Daymak's solar case.\nThe Chameleon is fully adaptable to every rider's demands. Entrepreneur and Co-inventor Aldo Baiocchi explains, \"You can't expect every rider to ride on flat ground or every rider to weigh about 120lbs. The Chameleon, thanks to the app we have developed, can be adjusted to match the rider's needs. The Chameleon has an 84V battery pack that can send enough torque to carry 300 lbs up a 35 degree incline, can go for longer distances by reducing power and running in ecomode or can be set to a lower speed for elderly users.\" The app can also lock up the motor adding additional security on top of its built in alarm system. \"The programmable LED lights can be set to a variety of colors and enhance visibility, thus increasing the rider's safety. With the Daymak solar case, the range is extended by up to 8 km a day under daylight and the signals and brake lights of the case work together with the regular signals, thus increasing visibility on the case itself,\" states Mr. Baiocchi. \"This scooter is a blast to ride, it's 100% green and it is the fastest accelerating scooter in the 500W class with no insurance or licensing required. The most advanced technology and the safest in its class.\"\nThe Chameleon ebike is targeting users who want more from their ride. The Chameleon is street legal in most areas in North America with no insurance or license required.\nThe Chameleon will come in 3 configurations to satisfy everyone's needs and budgets. The Chameleon Standard, Deluxe and Ultimate.\nThe Chameleon will be assembled and tested in North America at Daymak's Toronto location for further guaranteed quality control.\nSpecifications:\nDaymak My Ebike Application with bluetooth controller Range: up to 37 miles/60 km with the Standard Battery, over 75 miles/120 kms with the optional 84V24AH Lithium upgraded battery pack 500W brushless motor classified as power assisted bicycle.
