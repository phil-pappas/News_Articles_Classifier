It affects them psychologically,” he said. \n\nAnthony Akili, president and CEO of Smailing , also observed a change in travelling patterns. “(The poor economic situation today) isn’t stopping travel altogether, as Indonesians regard travel as a need. There is however, a shift in travel patterns. Those who have budgeted for their trips will still travel, but they are choosing either to shorten the vacation or head to a destination closer to home,” Akili explained. \n\nAs such, Akili expects domestic and regional travel to do well while longhaul demand will languish. \n\nBut Rama Tirtawisata, group managing director of Panorama Leisure Group, has found a silver lining in the cloud. \n\nTirtawisata said: “The strengthening of the US dollar has affected many countries, and data from Bank Indonesia shows that there are many currencies that have dipped deeper than the rupiah.” \n\nBank Indonesia’s 52-week data compilation on currency performance since June 30, 2014 reflected a 49 per cent decline in the Russian rouble against the greenback, a 27 per cent dip in the Turkish lira, and a 22 per cent fall in the Australian dollar. Some European currencies like the Swedish krona and the Danish krone were down between 19 and 22 per cent. \n\n“The rupiah was down 14 per cent so it is stronger (than these currencies), which makes travelling to these countries cheaper,” said an optimistic Tirtawisata, who revealed that Panorama Tours Indonesia will focus on promoting these destinations with special packages soon. \n\n“We will also allocate more budget for promotions and educate the market which is currently in shock,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T09:34:17.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
