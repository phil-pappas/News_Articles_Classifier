As the conversation developed, he promised he would fly her to China if she took him to New Zealand. She agreed. \n\"We have been flying to see each other each weekend for the past 6 months and landed in Beijing yesterday,\" he wrote on Tuesday. \n\"We're booked for New Zealand in February.\" \nGallagher said he had never expected to meet anyone over Tinder. He didn't even have time on his schedule anyway to meet Grace, but the pair continued to message each other for a month before actually meeting in person in March. \n\"I was there for work and wasn't even able to meet her when we matched. I probably wouldn't have even if I was able. \n\"Tinder was more of a 'hot or not' validation / confidence booster but I never was expecting or wanting to actually meet anyone on there. \n\"I'm so happy I did though.\" \nThe pair have shared the video of their flight to Beijing as proof that the promise made through Tinder chat was made good. Ad Feedback \nThe pair laugh at their meet-cute story through the dating app. \n\"I guess everyone wants some 'princess bride' story about their relationship. But some people meet on Tinder. As terrible as that sounds.\" \nHe expressed worry that the bar would be set too high, given that after only six months they were already flying around the world. \nBut he also seemed excited about their future. \n\"I can't wait for whatever is next.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T00:07:18.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
