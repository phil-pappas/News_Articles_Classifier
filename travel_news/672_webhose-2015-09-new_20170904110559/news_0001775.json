Mature traveller seeking anarchy and excitement: Intrepid... Share this article Share But while its significance in the Islamic world is well known, it also became a major but lesser known feature of British imperial culture.\nBack in the late 19th century Thomas Cook's premier package tour was the pilgrimage to Mecca, according to a study by Dr John Slight, a fellow at St John's College, University of Cambridge.\nHe found that in the 1880s the colonial government in India found itself under fire, with more of its Muslim subjects than ever before travelling to the Arabian Holy City.\nConcerns over exploitation and unsanitary conditions often involved in the journey had reached breaking point.\nBritish authorities turned to Thomas Cook and Son, which became the official travel agents for the Hajj in a bid to improve conditions.\nThe Mecca pilgrim encampment (pictured circa 1910) was a draw for early holidaymakers\nThe company was called in by the government in 1886, after a scandal surrounding the near-sinking of a pilgrim ship.\nThe firm was given a contract to arrange tickets, train journeys, ships and other logistics enabling Muslims living in India, as subjects of the British Crown, to perform Hajj.\nBut the project was shortlived as by 1893 the firm had made such a loss that it chose to pull out.\nJohn Mason Cook, Thomas Cook's son, remarked at the time: 'Some government officials said I am powerless to make any improvement.\n'I reminded them that government officials have been to a great extent powerless in relation to that pilgrimage.'\nDr Slight found that Britain's stewardship of the Hajj started with controls to prevent disease, but soon expanded into a full-blown bureaucracy.\nThomas Cook & Son's paperwork describes the arrival in Jeddah on Wednesday October 27,1886\nBy the mid-to-late 19th century, the British authorities were increasingly obliged to manage the pilgrimage so as to be seen as a friend and protector of Islam.\nOne problem was that of pilgrims who made the Hajj but could not afford to travel home.\nThe British paid for their repatriation and issued IOU forms - but these were rarely repaid.\n'It was one of the most significant unintended consequences of Britain's rule over a large part of the Islamic world,' Dr Slight said.\n'Britain ended up facilitating the pilgrimage in an ultimately futile attempt to gain legitimacy among its Muslim subjects. Inadvertently, it ended up acting like a Muslim power.'", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1OJkHdE"], "published": "2015-09-20T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T12:21:16.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
