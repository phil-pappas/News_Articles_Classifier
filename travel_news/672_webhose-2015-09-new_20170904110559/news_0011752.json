The series highlights Marriott’s history and brings life to the iconic brand, while showcasing the leading lodging company’s five core values – putting people first, pursuing excellence, embracing change, acting with integrity, and serving our world.\n \n \nMarriott International’s Content Studio led the overall creative development for the series, partnering with Los Angeles based production company, Believe Entertainment, to produce the series. Each animated episode illustrates one of the brand’s core values.\n \n \n“Original content creation is not a new idea for Marriott,” said Debbie M. Harrison, Global Officer, Culture at Marriott International. “In the 1960s, Hot Shoppe produced a weekly comic book; yesterday’s comic book is today’s YouTube video. We were innovative in the 1960s and today we’re continuing our innovation tradition communicating in new and engaging ways.”\n \n \nThe episodes were written by Ryan Turner, Jesse Pepe and Travis Braun. Ali Dee Theodore (“Despicable Me 2,” “Night at The Museum,” “Iron Man” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks) and Tony Bella composed the music for the series. The animation team, whose credits include “The Lion King,” “Toy Story,” “Dora The Explorer,” “Sesame Street,” “Wonder Pets” and “Peg & Cat” is comprised of Tone Thyne (Supervising Producer/Creative Director), Cassandra Gibbons (Designer/Art Director), Rick Ritter (Storyboards), Chris Timmons (Animator), Kyle Anderson (Animator), Heidi Sullivan (Animator) and Jeffrey Lesser (Music Mix/Sound Design).\n \n \n“We were very excited to partner with Marriott International on this project,” said Brian Hunt, evp of development and head of the studio at Believe Entertainment Group. “By combining simple, yet elegant, animation with a rich musical score, the series illustrates Marriott’s extraordinary origin stories to bring the heritage of this iconic brand to life.”\n \n“Marriott International truly believes in putting people first and taking care of our customers,” said David Beebe, vice president of creative content marketing at Marriott International. “With this series we wanted to highlight the importance of our consumers in an innovative and engaging way– illustrating how we strive to make their world a better place while enhancing their experiences.”\n \n \nThis series is the latest example of original content from Marriott International’s Content Studio. The first of its kind in the hospitality space, the studio’s aim is to engage worldwide communities of people passionate about travel that will drive commerce to the company’s hotels.\n \nSource:- Marriott", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:43:24.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
