Total arrivals dropped by some 20 per cent in August. \nBecause of the impact of the MERS scare, South Korea scaled down its total arrivals target from 15.5 million to 15 million this year, but still higher than the 14.2 million total arrivals in 2014. \nHye Jin Jang, assistant manager Manila office, Korea Tourism Oganization (KTO), said that in the Philippines, they are coordinating with ther 28 travel agency partners and five airlines (Korean Air, Asiana, Jeju Air, Cebu Pacific and Air Asia Philippines) to lure Filipino tourists, business travellers and MICE planners. \nKTO is renowned in the Philippines for taking good care of its travel agencies and corporate partners, and its ease of accessibility. \nThe Philippines is a small but fast-growing inbound market for South Korea.
