The first, Superman Ultimate Flight, made its debut in 2012. \nThe coaster's antics are intended to mimic the chaotic personality of this Batman nemesis. Besides the rolls, flips and inversions, park officials promise a first-on-the-West-Coast \"breaking-wave turn.\" \nThe construction effort will be an eco-friendly one. The wood-and-steel ride will retain the majority of the wood supports from the Roar, but the layout will differ greatly, a spokeswoman said. \nThe Joker should be ready for its first riders in the spring of 2016.
