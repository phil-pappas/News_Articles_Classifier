I can't honestly say for sure whether diesel is cleaner or cheaper than petrol, so conflicting are the endless news stories. But I can honestly say it is devious, designed to entrap, ensnare and make a fool of you. Or me, at least. Many years ago when I owned nothing more adventurous than a rusting pushbike, I was introduced to a woman who, I was utterly convinced, was “the one”. It only took a few sun-drenched hours in a back garden cloaked in the pungent fumes of burnt drumstick to know this. And I was determined that, if the anticipated snog materialised later that evening (it took another 48 hours actually), I'd whisk her away in a shiny coupe for an idyllic weekend in some far-off, secret palace by the sea. Or a B&B in Padstow. In a rented Nissan Cherry. Spontaneity and 10-day-old “love” fuelling our desire to stop wherever we liked... And so a few weeks later, having bunked off Friday and shouting out hits to accompany my specially-made Eighties hits tape, we chugged our way slowly down the A303 to Cornwall. Spontaneity and 10-day-old “love” fuelling our desire to stop wherever we liked, wander, smooch, daydream and pretend nothing else mattered. Until about 9pm when the fuel gauge had heaved to the left and, on top of Bodmin Moor under a moonless sky in the middle of November and nowhere, we were forced to stop at the nearest, dodgy-looking petrol station to fill up. “Not to worry,” I said in my most authoritative voice. “We're only an hour away.” We pulled away ... then, suddenly, nothing. No noise, no lights, no engine. Just downhill drift You can guess the rest, of course. We pulled away, the anticipation of the weekend making my skin tingle and then, suddenly, nothing. No noise, no lights, no engine. Just momentary downhill drift. We looked at each other in panic - I was more panicked to be honest. Because she knew almost instantly. “You didn't, did you? Oh God, you utter moron. We're in the middle of nowhere and you put petrol in a diesel car. You complete idiot.” I've omitted the many, many swear words. And thus the romantic weekend plummeted down a Cornish cliff into the deepest chasm of humiliation I'd ever known. We sat on the bonnet, barely speaking, waiting for the pick-up truck we'd summoned by mobile phone from the nearby village to save my dignity (bit late, to be fair). Exhaustion mixed with warm beer and mortified embarrassment make for a powerful sedative He dropped us off in the only place that had a room and promised to deliver the petrol-free car in the morning. “Don't mind the party,” he said. “The local farmer's boy is getting married.” And so we sat in a pub, eating wedding cake, drinking beer and ignoring each other as every person in the room pierced with incredulous looks these two big-city gatecrashers in their scruffy-best. We slept well. Exhaustion mixed with copious amounts of warm beer and mortified embarrassment make for a powerful sedative. The next morning devious diesel (it was, after all, his fault not mine) arrived in perfect working order and I spent the next 48 hours desperately trying to prove I wasn't the pathetic incompetent fool my date imagined me to be. It must have worked because we've been married nearly 20 years. And, yes, we do own a diesel. And every time we're in a service station the same refrain is barked out the passenger window. “Don't forget this time you idiot…” • If you value your relationship - or fancy starting a new one - it's best to be prepared.
