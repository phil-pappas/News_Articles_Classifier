The museum is divided into four rooms that are brightly colored in red, yellow and orange -- possibly to resemble a bag of gummy bears, possibly to induce migraines.\nExhibit cards are written in equally jolly shades and -- typographical snobs beware -- with generous use of bubble font .\nThroughout, there's a lingering Haribo smell (gloriously sweet and artificial) as though someone has opened a fresh bag and is waving it around.\nEach of the four multicolored rooms is more or less the same -- trotting out a history of sugar before turning its attention to candy.\nThere's a rundown of the local licorice industry in Uzes, complete with a mockup of an old factory workshop peopled by waxwork women sternly rolling out the black stuff.\nOpposite is a life-size model of Hans Riegel, the German confectioner who in the 1920s created Haribo in his laundry room.\nIt's a little disappointing to discover he looked like an ordinary baker rather than Willy Wonka.\nSugar rush\nMarshmallow varieties are popular in France, Scandinavians love licorice and Star Mix is a UK best-seller. At this point the tour has lost the attention of any visitors under the age of 14.\nThey've zipped ahead to find out what they can get with their tokens.\nThey miss a video proudly explaining the achievements of the Haribo empire -- including the fact it churns out 100 million Gold Bears each day.\nThe kids return 10 minutes later chewing the contents of small bags of jellybeans they've apparently acquired from a \"special machine\" in room four.\nLightly hopped up on sugar, they're mesmerized by video footage of old Haribo commercials while adults read how the business developed.\nIn the third room there's yet another video exhibit, this one showing what happens inside a modern Haribo factory.\nIt's surprisingly interesting -- there's something relaxing about watching hundreds of candies take shape.\nFollowing the factory experience, children (and adults) get to pretend to be factory workers via interactive games.\nIn one, visitors press buttons and pull levers so a small truck picks up boxes of candy.\nMORE: Toyota Kaikan: Inside one of the world's most fascinating factory tours\nCylinders full of candy\nEach day Haribo produces 100 million Gold Bears. The highlight of the museum is downstairs.\nFinally, adults can see what the children were so excited about: Haribo's Willy Wonka-style experience.\nIt's a room with huge cylinders full of candy.\nWhen a token is inserted, jellybeans or strawberry candies are released from a cylinder and travel down a funnel. They fall into a small bag that's then sealed and deposited with pleasing precision into a metal tray for collection.\nFor many adults, this sugar hit is enough, but there's no escaping the siren call of the boutique on the way out.\nNearly every iteration of Haribo is available for purchase in quantities ranging from small bags to enormous tubs.\nThere are also trinkets, towels and stationery.\nThen it's back out into the parking lot where a long line stretches out of the museum entrance.\nLife is sweet, but only if you get there early.\nHaribo Museum , Pont des Charrettes UZES ( Francia), 30700 Uzes France;\nFive other delicious museums\nToo cute to eat?
