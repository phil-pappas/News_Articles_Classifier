Henceforth, the airline operates flights to both countries on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. With the increased flight frequencies, Brussels but also other Brussels Airlines destinations (in the US, UK, France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Scandinavia) are now even more accessible.\nThe frequency increase is good news for travelers, but also for the freight forwarders who now have more capacity available to ship cargo on board the Airbus A330 aircraft of Brussels Airlines.\nLast week, Liberia was declared Ebola-free. Two incubation periods have passed (42 days) since the last Ebola patient tested negative, and no new cases were reported since then. Sierra Leone, however, has not been declared Ebola-free yet, but the number of cases is decreasing. Both countries are working intensively on rebuilding their economy, so Brussels Airlines has decided to contribute to this goal, too.\nSource:-Brussels Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T21:09:14.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
