Family discovers Brazil's gold medal attractions at daughter's Olympic qualifying event By Nancy And Elizabeth Jorgensen , Special to the Journal Sentinel Sept. 4, 2015 1:00 p.m. (1) Comments Nancy Jorgensen Gwen Jorgensen and husband Patrick Lemieux are all smiles on the streets of Rio de Janeiro after Jorgensen won the Olympic qualifying competition. Elizabeth Jorgensen Tourists snap photos of Christ the Redeemer statue through the mist of clouds in Rio de Janeiro. Elizabeth Jorgensen Visitors can tour Rio de Janeiro by bicycle. Nancy Jorgensen The Jorgensen family, including Gwen (clockwise from back left), Elizabeth, Nancy and Joel, reunites in Rio de Janeiro in July for the first time since Christmas when Gwen departed for training camps. \nCrescent beaches, soaring mountains and swinging samba attract thousands of tourists each year to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. But we — Nancy, Joel and Elizabeth — traveled to Rio in July for one reason: to watch our younger daughter, 2012 Olympic triathlete Gwen Jorgensen, race for another Olympic qualification. \nTwo American athletes would earn a spot on Team USA's Olympic roster, but they had to finish in the top eight overall. The world's top three triathletes are all from the United States, which meant at least one would be disappointed. \nAfter a 13-hour overnight flight, we arrived five days before the qualifying race to explore this tropical South American city. Founded by the Portuguese 450 years ago, Rio will host the 2016 Summer Olympics Aug. 5-21, with more to offer than athletics. \nOur first stop, though, was to find Gwen and husband Patrick Lemieux, who both left in December for training camps in Australia and Spain. We hug and take reunion pictures during lunch at Brasileirinho at Hotel Debret (Av. Atl ntica, 3564 - Copacabana), where we checked in. Team USA was also staying at the hotel, so lunch and breakfast offered opportunities for rare family time during a high-pressure competition week. \nWhile Gwen spent days in the pool, on the bike course and in running paths around the city, we experienced Rio de Janeiro. Getting around \nTraffic in Rio is often congested, with motorcycles zipping in, out and between lanes, and adolescent boys selling goods in highway traffic. \nFor trips to Lapa, Cristo Redentor or the airport, we found taxis safe and easy to use. Drivers accepted only cash, and since most do not speak English, we handed them notes with destination and address. There is also bus and subway service, but locals at the Copacabana information booth recommended taxis, especially after dark. \nAs in any major city, caution is advised — we hid wallets and purses, and avoided wearing expensive jewelry. \nWe reaped the benefits of a favorable exchange rate ($1=R$3.49) in the form of low prices. Credit cards are accepted widely in Rio, but we needed cash for street food, taxis and beach purchases. Taking the tours \nFree walking tours are ubiquitous in Europe, but our Rio guide, Fabiana, told us they are new to Brazil. \nEnglish, Spanish and Portuguese groups assembled in front of the Municipal Theater at 9:30 a.m. to learn about Rio de Janeiro's history, economy and culture. In our three-hour journey around Lapa and Centro we visited famous sites including the Cathedral of San Sebastian, the Escadaria Selarón public mosaic and the aqueduct. \nFabiana eagerly answered questions and promoted her city. Although the tour is free, tips are encouraged, and Fabiana earned generous gratuities. \nFor lunch, we joined Gwen, Patrick, and the Specialized crew that was in Rio to maintain bikes and create promotional videos for sponsored athletes. The Specialized guys invited us to trek with them to Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) on Corcovado Mountain, where photographer Etienne could scour photos. \nThe crew negotiated with two taxi drivers, agreeing to pay R$120 ($40) each. The drivers would transport us to the mountain, wait an hour and bring us back. \nTo enter the park, our taxi scaled steep cliffs along winding roads. Once inside Tijuca Forest National Park, we opted for a bus (instead of tram) to reach the mountain's peak. \nExiting the bus, we ascended fog-laden stairs to the statue cloaked in vapor. We timed our photos with the shifting clouds. Unlike U.S. tourist spots, there were no guides or placards explaining facts or providing details. Etienne scored artistic shots of Christ in the mist and we took selfies amid tourists. \nAs we descended the mountain, our friendly, unhurried taxi driver suggested stopping at a second viewpoint. Etienne was happy to get another shot. Rio by bike \nFrom our hotel, we walked 20 minutes to Bike in Rio (Street Ronald de Carvalho, 21 - Copacabana), where we had reservations for a three-hour Copacabana to Flamengo bike tour. \nOwner Bruno fit us for bikes while we waited for other registered participants. When they didn't show, he treated us to a private tour. Fluent in English, Bruno followed bike paths through the city, stopping to explain historical figures, beaches, parks and present day Rio. \nOn Bruno's recommendation, we enjoyed a classic Brazilian steakhouse lunch at Churrascaria Carretão Lido (Rua Ronald de Carvalho, 55). Waiters circulated with unending skewers of sirloin, filet, sausage and pork, and plates of bananas and cheese bread. The salad buffet offered beets, artichokes, olives, lettuces and an array of sushi. The beach \nWe spent afternoons on Copacabana Beach, across the street from our hotel, where chairs and umbrellas rent for the day at R$5 ($1.50) each. \nRio's winter sun is hot, but under an umbrella, sipping Caipirinhas (Rio's national cocktail), we lounged cool and refreshed. Walking amid beachgoers, vendors hawked food and drink (chips, grilled blocks of cheese, acai, shrimp, Caipirinhas, tea) and other goods (bags, jewelry, sunglasses, hats). \nAnticipating the triathlon event, news sources reported Olympic water-quality concerns. Water is routinely tested for bacteria, but not viruses, and with Brazil's custom of directing untreated sewage into waterways, concern arose for rowing, sailing, and swimming athletes. \nCopacabana Beach — where triathlon is held — is the cleanest of Rio de Janeiro's beaches, and triathlon officials reiterated that the water met race standards. We watched triathletes in the surf , familiarizing themselves with the swim course, but other competitors choose to swim exclusively in chlorinated pool water and reserve Copacabana Beach for race day. \nThe local population seemed undeterred by water reports — parents with babies played in the waves, and the beach crowd arrived early and stayed until the 5:30 p.m. sunset. \nDispelling any health reservations, Elizabeth and Joel rented stand-up paddle boards. After a 30-minute session testing their balance in the tides, Elizabeth opted for another 30 minutes on a double board, offering Dad a passenger ride. \nOne of Elizabeth's priorities was an evening of samba music, and both our walking tour guide, Fabiana, and a family friend recommend Rio Scenarium (R. do Lavradio, 20 - Centro). \nMuch of Rio's samba music spills from bars into streets, but Rio Scenarium offers a club atmosphere and three floors of seating. Built atrium-like around a stage, musicians can be seen and heard on each of Rio Scenarium's three levels. \nWe spent most of our evening on the first floor with drinks and appetizers, watching locals (with a variety of skill) on the dance floor, and then toured other floors decorated with antique furniture, musical instruments and woodworking tools. The race \nAnticipating Gwen's Sunday race, we spent Saturday watching five categories of paratriathlon, rooting for Team USA and scouting the course for the best vantage points. \nStandard at high-caliber triathlons (but absent from Rio's event) are grandstand seating and a jumbotron that follows the action. Rio's event broadcast commentary through a beachside loudspeaker, and we anticipate seating and a large screen will be added for the Olympics. \nFor Sunday's women's triathlon race, we staked a spot at the swim exit, only to be blocked by a burgeoning crowd of photographers. \nPeering around cameras, we watched Gwen exit in 19th place to position herself in the front pack of 24 cyclists. \nWe sprinted to the road where, eight times, we saw competitors ride through the transition zone, make two, 90-degree turns, and ride back in the opposite direction. \nOur cheering and T-shirts (with \"Gwensanity Runs In Our Family\" embroidered on the back) drew attention, and a young Brazilian fan befriended us. He laughed at our anxiety, saying, \"She number one! She going to win,\" and after each lap asking, \"How is Mom's heart?\" \nDuring the 10K run, Gwen and two British athletes fought for places on the podium. In the last stage of the race, Gwen made a move, pulled ahead and finished first by 20 seconds. She and American Sarah True (fourth place) earned spots on the Olympic team. \nVictory for Gwen means a return trip to Rio, and we already have a to-do list. We want to learn Portuguese phrases for how much, where is the bathroom, thank you, and numbers 1-20; kayak the waters next to Sugarloaf Mountain; and ride one of Bruno's three other bike tours. \nAnd, of course, attend plenty of Olympic events. GOING FOR THE GOLD \nOn Sept. 18, Waukesha native Gwen Jorgensen will race in Chicago for the 2015 ITU Triathlon World Championship. She is the reigning 2014 World Champion, has won 12 consecutive ITU world triathlon races and is currently ranked No. 1 in the world. She placed 38th in the 2012 London Olympics. Here's what you need to know about Jorgensen's upcoming bid for gold at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil: \n■ Aug 5-21: Rio 2016 Olympics \n■ Aug 18, 20: Men's and women's triathlon competitions, respectively \n■ Brazil: First country in South America to host the Summer Olympics. \n■ Copacabana: One of four regions hosting Olympic events.
