The wineries cover a 10-mile radius throughout Oakland and the trail is walkable and easily accessible by public transportation. The Oakland Urban Wine Trail includes 10 wineries with grapes sourced from all over California. What makes Oakland’s trail unique? Variety in an already different location, Oakland’s urban wineries are housed in renovated warehouses and offers visitors tasting rooms in industrial neighborhoods, artist community spaces, and even waterfront locations. Oakland vintners source their grapes from throughout California and bring a unique Oakland flavor to the trail, influenced by their different backgrounds and winemaking experiences. “You no longer have to travel to traditional wine country for great, quality wine,” remarked Alison Best, President and CEO of Visit Oakland. “These winemakers were drawn here because Oakland’s the place to try something different, like building your winery in a warehouse instead of a vineyard! We are proud that our vintners are putting a new spin on winemaking in our state, adding their authentic Oakland flavor.” The Oakland Urban Wine Trail represents a growing interest in winemaking outside of the traditional wine country. Wineries include Campovida, Cerruti Cellars, Dashe Cellars, Irish Monkey Cellars, Jeff Cohn Cellars, Periscope Cellars, Rosenblum Cellars, Stage Left Cellars, Two Mile Wines, and Urban Legend. Over 10 million glasses of East Bay wines have been poured in the last year alone, with over 15 thousand visitors frequenting tasting rooms in the region. To help visitors navigate the trail, an Oakland Urban Wine Trail brochure and map, as well as a microsite have been launched. Visit Oakland is installing street decals throughout the city to help wine enthusiasts find the closest tasting room. On the digital strategy front, a new advertising campaign focused on display advertising and video debuted this week. The launch of the Oakland Urban Wine Trail coincides with California Wine Month in September. This month is a great time for visitors to learn about the harvest season and experience one of the state’s signature agricultural products.
