Her business sets out to show how people can cut gluten from their diet without sacrificing taste, offering delicious recipes that focus on preparing fresh dishes from scratch. Aside from its extensive recipe library, Gluten Freedom Club also sets out to increase awareness and change perceptions of gluten-free cooking. The roots of Gluten Freedom Club lie in Ms Parris’ own personal experience. When her mother was diagnosed with coeliac disease in 1996, Ms Parris was inspired to find a way to recreate the dishes her mother was no longer able to eat. Her quest to reinvent her mother’s favourite meals lead her to the celebrated Westminster Kingsway culinary school. She later joined the kitchen at Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester – one of only four UK restaurants to hold three Michelin stars. • Win a state-of-the-art Canon printer for your SME »", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T18:42:23.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
