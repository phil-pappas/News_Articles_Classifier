He won the Best Newcomer Award at this year’s Melbourne International Comedy Festival, and received rave reviews for his Edinburgh Fringe Festival debut.\nBut it’s his time in foster care that still haunts him. Here he has written a gruelling, honest account of that time, and why he thinks the system needs to change.\nBe warned — it’s brutal.\n***\nMy mum was a heroin addict. As bad as it was growing up in a Harmony Korine film, my time in foster care was far worse. In countless different foster homes I was starved, bashed, emotionally abused, raped by an older foster brother and taken on holiday to the Tamworth Country Music Festival.\nBefore my mother went to The-Great-Heroin-Dealer-In-The-Sky, child services kept returning me to her care despite repeated abuse and neglect. This is a household in which my sister was shaken as a baby, yet time and time again we were reunited with a woman whose spirit animal was the concept of neglect. Based on my experience, were Josef Fritzl Australian, child services would have given him his children/grandchildren back so long as he promised to convert the dungeon into a consensual sex basement.\nRight now we’re midway through a Royal Commission into how good Australia is at child abuse, a kind of Melbourne Cup for institutional paedophilia and child neglect. With God on their side, the Catholic Church is the favourite, but the foster care system is a roughie that can’t be ignored.\nCalling the foster care system broken is like saying Agent Orange is “a bit itchy.” A recent report revealed hundreds of foster children are being physically and sexually abused while in care. Others have concluded foster children have vastly increased risks of homelessness, mental illness, substance abuse, poor education outcomes, imprisonment and suicide.\nThere is no greater indictment of the foster care system when a news website’s go-to-option for an article on growing up in foster care is me, an overweight middling comedian with jokes about wanking and pies. Couldn’t get a doctor? An accountant? I tell jokes about drone strikes to barflies for free soft drink.\nPeople have no idea foster care is this bad. Finding out the system supposed to protect children is rife with abuse is like discovering the RSPCA runs dogfighting rings or Beyonce is pro-female genital mutilation.\nThe blame lies with State Labor and Liberal Governments. For decades they’ve taken turns doing nothing, like actors in some shit Samuel Beckett play. In 2007, the Federal Government suspended the Racial Discrimination Act, sending soldiers to the Northern Territory when a report found systematic child abuse in remote communities. Way more children have been abused in the State foster care systems, so by the Federal Government’s logic they should send in tanks to the State Parliaments. But of course they won’t.\nThe foster care system is so underfunded it has less money than a charity helping parking inspectors swim with dolphins. It’s overburdened, at breaking point. Child services employ too few social workers, each one dealing with massive caseloads that mean they can neither properly support good foster carers or adequately monitor bad ones.\nThere’s a severe shortage of foster carers. It takes a special kind of person to even foster in the first place; these benevolent weirdos take in the children of strangers while we’re all praying that crying baby on the plane shuts up. But that tiny number gets whittled down by the poor pay and the minimal assistance from child services, twin blows exacerbated by the fact many foster children are extremely high-needs. It’s unsurprising many foster carers quit in bitter exhaustion. The result is foster children being moved from foster home to foster home, displaced, marginal, without a sense of belonging.\nWe also need to acknowledge some people aren’t parent material. There are roughly 20,000 Australian children in foster care and that number is growing. A guy I know, a big drunken drugging wreck, once told me that he hoped a baby would help him “grow up.” People actually think children are life coaches you get to name. “We shall call him Oliver, may fatherhood stop me vomiting over myself on Friday nights.” I think we should pay people to be given long-term contraception until they get their life together. Give them money, jet skis, a nice kettle.\nWe live in a time of enormous collective delusion. One in which we naively let anyone have children, then elect politicians who don’t protect the victims of that naivety. When the Royal Commission hands down recommendations for how our society can better protect children, I hope one of them is self-awareness.\nCorey White is a stand-up comedian and writer.
