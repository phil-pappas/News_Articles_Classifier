The event, organised by the Kent Invicta Chamber of Commerce will take place across the venue’s facilities including the Maidstone Exhibition Hall, Clive Emson Building and the John Hendry on the 7th October. \nIt will again co-locate with the Manufacturing and Electronics Expo and is expected to attract over 180 exhibitors and 2,500 construction, manufacturing and engineering professionals from Kent, the South East and across the UK. The Expo includes keynote speeches from the former Minister of State for UK Trade & Investment, Lord Digby Jones who will be covering the tangible opportunities for construction, manufacturing and engineering that could come from building on existing and expanding into new markets. Dr David Hancock, Head of Construction at the Cabinet Office will be looking at “The Future of Government Construction”. Other confirmed sessions include an update from Fenlon Dunphy from the London Paramount project as well as presentations from Neil Edwards from the Builders Conference, Anthony Eastwood from Rolls Royce Motor Cars and Lee Penford from BAE Systems. Jo James from the Kent Invicta Chamber of Commerce says: “The Construction and Manufacturing & Electronics Expo is a large, complex exhibition and conference encompassing keynotes speakers, exhibitors, workshops, demonstration areas and a large FREE ‘Meet the Buyer’ area. The Kent Event Centre proved to be a great location in 2014 as it fulfils the needs of all these individual parts offering modern facilities that fully meet the expectations of our exhibitors, speakers and workshop presenters. We are looking forward to a highly productive day on the 7th October in these great surroundings and to Lord Digby Jones launching the Kent Manufacturing Focus Group.” Kent Event Centre Manager, Alison Wallington, adds: “We’re delighted that the Chamber of Commerce has chosen to hold the event here for the second year. It’s a great show and really makes the most of the space and facilities we have on offer in the Maidstone Exhibition Hall.” Latest news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T16:28:11.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
