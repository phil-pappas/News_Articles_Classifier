Eldon Meyer brought his wife, Maggie, from the East to a rundown farmhouse on a hill outside his hometown of Hermann on the Missouri River. She was not happy. “I was a Jersey girl – I thought it was the Wild West,” Maggie said. “I guess you could call it a mid-life crisis. We thought it would be nice to have a farm, but this was a dump.” Four years later, the couple had fixed up the two-story farmhouse to the point where they decided to turn it into a bed-and-breakfast in the country, with hummingbirds by the front porch swing and a donkey in the pasture. They called it Meyer’s Hilltop Farm because it was, indeed, on a hill above the tiny town of McKittrick, which is across the river from Hermann. That was 1990 and, unbeknown to Eldon and Maggie, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources had big plans for the abandoned Missouri-Kansas-Texas rail line that ran along the bottom of the hill. In a fortunate bit of serendipity, Katy Trail State Park, a linear recreational trail, was opened the same year the Meyers opened their B&B. The trail soon was providing a steady flow of customers who welcomed Eldon’s gracious hospitality and Maggie’s hearty breakfasts. They expanded by adding an adjoining suite with a huge jetted tub for weary riders. “In the beginning, business was fair, but in the last five years, it’s exploded,” Maggie said. “We have people come from all over. They love that trail, and they come back.” As Katy Trail State Park celebrates its 25th anniversary this summer, the Meyers celebrated their quarter century in business by retiring. Eldon is 82 and Maggie 10 years behind, and they liked the thought of slowing down. “It was very hard to retire from it,” Maggie said. “We made a lot of relationships. I just had somebody call last night. “But the Katy Trail made us rich enough to be able to retire.” In the last 25 years, some changes are obvious on the trail. It has grown to 240 miles, stretching from Machens on the east to Clinton on the west. Once the trains stopped running, the forests along the flat, crushed-stone trail have grown a canopy of green, providing a welcoming sun-dappled shade for hikers and bikers. From Machens to Boonville on the eastern half, much of the trail follows the Missouri River. In some spots, the 8-foot wide trail has the muddy river on one side, and wooded bluffs on the other. The trail is just as the late Ted Jones and his wife, Pat, envisioned it. Jones is the St. Louis businessman who provided the money needed to purchase the abandoned line and develop it as the nation’s longest rails-to-trails conversion. Page 2 of 2 - Jones wanted to show off the beauty of the Lower Missouri River Valley, and bring a bit of life to the small towns left behind by the railroad. Katy Trail State Park today draws some 400,000 visitors a year, and generates about $18.5 million to the state economy annually. For every dollar spent on the trail, the state sees a return on investment of $18. For the visitors, the trail provides a back-door look at the bucolic countryside of tidy farms and sleepy towns in the rural heartland, far away from the buzz and billboards of the interstates. The trail is pretty in spring when the redbuds and dogwoods bloom, busy in summer and gorgeous in fall when that green canopy turns red and gold. A balmy winter day has great views of the river and bluffs. And, like all Missouri state parks, it’s free.
