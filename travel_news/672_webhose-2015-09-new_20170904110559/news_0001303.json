Through a recent agreement, Jeppesen now provides SkyWest and ExpressJet with its Crew Pairing optimization solution, to maximize scheduling efficiency.\n“Jeppesen Crew Pairing allows us to improve how we plan and execute optimized crew assignments and schedules, to the benefit of our overall operating business model,” said Jim Jensen, vice president, Information Technology, SkyWest, Inc. “We look forward to realizing bottom line results from enhancing the complex process of pairing fleet-wide crew assignments.”\nUsing Jeppesen Crew Pairing, SkyWest and ExpressJet are now able to optimize a full monthly crew schedule, instead of a typical daily or weekly outlook. Typically, airline use of Jeppesen Crew Pairing reduces crew planning and operations costs by an average of three to 15 percent annually and greatly reduces the time needed for crew planning and implementation.\n“In a highly competitive business environment, Jeppesen crew management tools provide an advantage for reducing operating costs and the time required to develop precision schedules,” said Peter Andersson, director, Jeppesen Crew Optimization. “We will continue to support SkyWest and ExpressJet in their effort to achieve the most efficient crew management processes that consider the realities of fleet-wide scheduling and operations requirements.”\nOverall, Jeppesen Crew Pairing offers powerful decision support, enabling effective control of costs and other objectives, while its flexibility and modeling capabilities simplify change management procedures. The pairing optimizer feature within the solution allows airlines to test multiple scenarios quickly, minimize hotel and per diem costs and considers numerous options across multiple base locations to further enhance crew planning efficiency across its operations.\nSkyWest, Inc. airline companies provide commercial air service in cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean with nearly 3,400 daily flights and a fleet of 680 aircraft. SkyWest Airlines operates through partnerships with United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, US Airways, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines. ExpressJet Airlines operates through partnerships with United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.\nSource:-ExpressJet", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:09:05.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
