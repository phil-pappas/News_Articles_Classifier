We have a careful focus on customer service and recommend the right wines to pair with a meal, which is very important for restaurant reviews and reputation.” \nAntonio uses a six-step approach to recommend wines. “I train our food and beverage staff to host customers through a wine tasting process. Each person is asked six initial questions to determine their flavour and style, depending on their meal and the season.” \n“Every customer prefers a different taste, and this is what I love most about helping them discover the perfect wine for them on the night. I am honoured to receive this award as I continue to take my customers on a culinary awakening when they dine at The Terrace Restaurant in Perth,” he said.
