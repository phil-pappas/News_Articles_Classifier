(Kyodo photo) - + Japan, China, S. Korea target 30m visitors TOKYO â€” From dumplings to fried noodles, more and more municipalities in Japan are promoting specialty dishes as a way to attract tourists and revitalise their economies. \nSome regions are more ambitious still, hoping the trend will help generate interest among young people in rediscovering their local food culture and power a movement calling for \"local production for local consumption.\" \nA prime example is Utsunomiya, a city in Tochigi prefecture just outside of Tokyo, which most Japanese nowadays would immediately associate with its famous \"gyoza\" dumplings. \n\"When we first started promoting ourselves as 'gyoza city,' a number of television stations in Tokyo did reports about it,\" an Utsunomiya city official said, recalling the initial campaign in 1993. \nThe headquarters of an Imperial Japanese Army division stationed in northeastern China used to be located in Utsunomiya, and gyoza are believed to have taken root in the city when repatriated soldiers brought back the custom of eating authentic Chinese pot-stickers. The fact that Utsunomiya is a big producer of leeks, one of the main ingredients in dumplings, also contributed to the dish's local popularity. \nBack in 1990, city officials were searching for something that Utsunomiya could claim to lead the country in when they came upon statistics that showed the city consumed the most number of dumplings per household in Japan. \n\"So we decided to pitch ourselves as 'gyoza city,'\" the official said. \nRestaurants serving dumplings got together to launch the Utsunomiya Gyoza Association and city officials joined in efforts to compile a map of the eateries for visitors. The campaign gained publicity thanks to media coverage. \nThe dumpling mecca now even has its own annual gyoza festival. \"About 60% of the nearly 15 million visitors each year come to Utsunomiya for the sake of eating gyoza,\" the official said. \nAt the same time, the city is also trying to promote itself to jazz and cocktail lovers. \nBut even as Utsunomiya tries to promote other attractions such as the historical site of the Oya Stone Mine and the city's hosting of the Japan Cup Cycle Road Race, its gyoza fame continues to dominate the scene. \"Recently, even foreign tourists are visiting us for the dumplings,\" according to the official. \nMeanwhile down in southwestern Japan, Saga in Kyushu has gained its spot among food lovers for its local specialty known as \"Sicilian rice.\" Its basic form is warm rice on a plate covered with sweet-and-spicy sauteed meat and raw salad vegetables, then topped with mayonnaise. Recent variations include ones that use expensive branded Saga beef as an ingredient. \nThe dish is said to have originated at a restaurant about 40 years ago as a meal provided to its staff members. It later got included in the menu of a cafe in the city and eventually became a common dish at local households. \n\"If you ask people in the city what dish we are famous for, many will reply 'nothing at all,'\" said Takeharu Nakashima, representative of a citizens' group that has been promoting Sicilian rice since 2009. \"So we first aimed to popularise it among local residents.\" \nWith the dish's appearance in the \"B-1 Grand Prix\" regional food festival and media reports about it, more locals became aware of the specialty and a growing number of eateries began to serve the dish. \n\"At first, our goal was to achieve high ratings at the Grand Prix,\" Nakashima said. \"Then we realised that what was really necessary was to create an opportunity for everyone to come together as one and think about (how to promote) our city.\" \nThe process of searching for a local specialty cuisine and popularising it has helped locals rediscover the region's values and given momentum to discussions about community building, he added. \nIn Kobe, a western Japan port city already well-known for its restaurants, cakes shops and bakeries, authorities are stepping up efforts to utilise its culinary fame to attract even more visitors from around the world. \nIn April, Kobe announced a plan to develop the city into a new food mecca by 2020, including promoting a variety of local produce and seafood in addition to the city's most famous specialty -- Kobe beef. \nThe plan is modeled after global cities frequented by gourmets, such as San Francisco and Portland in the United States, and San Sebastian in Spain's Basque Autonomous Community. \nFor example, strawberries produced in Kobe are so popular that patisseries in Japan vie with each other to get hold of them. When branded as \"Kobe strawberries\" and exported to Hong Kong, the fruit received higher ratings than those from other parts of Japan, according to the city. \nThe city plans to launch a non-profit organisation that will involve farmers, chefs, local residents and others. The aim is to create new dishes through exchanges between chefs and farmers, engage in city planning to develop a community with unique restaurants, and encourage a lifestyle where local produce is consumed locally. \nAnother example is Tsuruoka in Yamagata prefecture, northeastern Japan. Last December, Tsuruoka became the first Japanese city to be designated by Unesco as a Creative City of Gastronomy. \nTsuruoka officials said the city won praise for its continued production by generations of its farmers of about 50 native crops such as \"dadachamame,\" a type of edamame green soybean, and Atsumi turnips. \nThe city has also received recognition for other attractions, such as a three-star rating by an internationally acclaimed tourist guidebook for the avenue of Japanese cedars on the Three Mountains of Dewa, and a Guinness World Record for the most number of jellyfish species exhibited at the city-run Kamo Aquarium. \nBut the officials said they won't stop at international recognition of sightseeing spots. \n\"We now bear the new responsibility of protecting and upholding our food culture,\" one of the officials said.
