Picture: Jennifer Morrow Source: Flickr \nATTENDING the notoriously wild Burning Man festival takes commitment and a lot of know-how. \nBecause the adventure starts way before the festival, and planning your journey all the way out to the middle of the desert in Black Rock City, Nevada, presents a fun and logistical challenge. \nYou’ll have to factor in that day time temperatures can exceed 35˚C and plummet to the low teens at night. You also have to anticipate all your needs for the duration of your stay, most obviously water and food. \nAnd if that wasn’t enough, you can’t leave anything behind — except perhaps a little piece of your heart. \nHere’s what you need to know about what to pack and how to plan for the adventure along with some rules not to be broken. \n• Camp and clothing \nSelf-expression, usually in the form of dressing up, is a serious affair at Burning Man. Same goes for decorating your tent and camping area. \nMake sure you’re prepared to join the fun on themed days. Basic festival themes to adhere to include: Tu Tu Tuesday, Leopard Skin Thursday, and of course the overall theme this year, Carnival of Mirrors. \nBut your attire also needs to be practical for a desert environment. The evenings can be chilly, so warm jumpers and sweatshirts are essential if you intend on taking full advantage of the night time outdoor dancefloors. \nWe also recommend adding touches of UV neon paint to complete your Burning Man look because you can easily lose your group in the dark among the thousands of other partygoers sprawled across the desert — so get your UV face paint and glow sticks on! \nAlso, prepare to see a lot of nude people wandering around. Tu Tu Tuesday.

In Burning Man terminology, a gift is something which does not require reciprocation or an exchange of goods of equal value. \nWhether it’s ice-cold slices of watermelon, chocolate brownies, umbrellas for the heat, karaoke facilities or an entire camp devoted to repairing your bike free of charge, gifting is part of what makes these festivals so much fun and so unique. \nSo make sure you’re stocked up like Santa and plan your gifts in advance. Bring enough for everyone! Picture: Jennifer Morrow Source: Flickr \nWater \nThe clue: you’re spending seven days in the desert. This means all your food, water and drinks have to be pre-planned. That includes water for washing (you and your dishes) as well as hydrating, which is incredibly important when spending around 12 hours every day under the desert sun. \nThis festival comes with no shower facilities, but you have a couple of options: try renting a van to provide some comforts of home, or you could cross your fingers and hope you stumble into one of the many themed camps where you might be lucky enough to find a shower. \nWhatever you choose to do, planning for water access is essential. Prepare your water supply. Picture: Jason Eppink Source: Flickr \nFood \nHow do you keep your energy up so that you don’t miss out on all the fun? There’s plenty to do at Burning Man; biking around, visiting the themed camps, admiring the structures, as well all the fun and games once night fall comes. All this burns kilojoules at an accelerated rate, especially when the heat rises. \nIf you’re there with a van, pre-order or make a few cooked meals in advance which you can then freeze and reheat on the day. And be prepared for the dust storms. Source: AP \nLighter snacks like energy bars and fresh fruit are also practical. If you don’t have a van, then stop at a Walmart on the way to stock up on cheap food — but remember that whatever you buy you have to carry. \nAlternatively, themed camps can help out and they’re great for finding little luxuries — but it’s best not to rely on them for a full week’s feed. Look out for these pit-stops: Artica and the Ice Caps for ice and Bacon without borders for an all day brekkie. Get ready to shine.

It will happen, you will miss out on something. \nIt’s inevitable because there’s just too much going on at once. But if you want to make the most of your time, plan what you’re going to see in advance. There are great blogs, survival guides and checklists online. \nThe Time To Burn app will help you keep track of playa events. Make sure you know the festival schedule , so you can always be in the right place at the right time. Once you’ve got a prioritised list of what you’re going to see and do, make sure you can get between these things quickly and get a bike. Getting creative.

Don’t sit on the side lines. Throw yourself into the ring. That’s what Burning Man is for, and that’s how you’ll have experiences you’ll never forget. Nudity is common here.
