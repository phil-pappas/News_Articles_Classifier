They roam free in parking lots, parks, golf courses, and even, on occasion, the airport baggage terminal. But the mysterious deaths have shaken the island community. \n“One day,” Lihue resident Joseph Manini Jr. told the Kauai newspaper, \" I saw one fall right out of a tree .\" \nThe Garden Island reported that dead chickens were being shoveled into a state conservation department truck and have been shipped to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's office on Oahu for testing to determine the cause of death.

The birds have few predators. \nEarlier this year, Kauai's famous feathered creatures drew national attention as the subject of a New York Times article . \n“They’re absolutely everywhere,” Eben J. Gering, an evolutionary biologist at Michigan State University who has been studying the birds, told the newspaper. “They seem to be living a whole diversity of lifestyles, from eating garbage and cat food to being fed by tourists at the beach to foraging on native arthropods.” \nNot surprisingly, not everyone enjoys their presence. \n\"Those darn roosters had me up before 5 every morning ,\" Bob Brenner, a visitor from Austin, Texas, told The Wall Street Journal. \"If I had a gun, I would have shot a couple of them. They are all over the place. They walk right into the restaurants.\" John Elk via Getty Images \nKauai's chickens have suddenly turned up dead before. \nIn 2007, the Kauai Humane Society suspected an overwhelming bacterial infection was responsible for killing dozens of the birds. And last year, Kauai authorities launched an investigation after several chickens were shot -- and at least one killed -- by blowgun darts. \nWhile it is unclear how long the current investigation will take, a USDA spokeswoman said samples of the chickens that died this week were scheduled to arrive in Honolulu for testing Wednesday .
