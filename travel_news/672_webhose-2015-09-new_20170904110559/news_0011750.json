The “Surf With a Legend: Custom Surfboard and Lesson With Bill Hamilton” begins with a private two-hour session with Mr. Hamilton for a family of four. Guests then have lunch at the hotel’s poolside restaurant, and following their meal, Mr. Hamilton takes them to his workshop in the town of Hanalei where they work with him to design a surfboard (one board per group). The finished board is shipped to them a few weeks later. The offer includes four nights’ accommodations in a premium ocean view room, daily breakfast, a poolside lunch for a family of four, one surf lesson with Mr. Hamilton and one custom-designed surfboard with shipping. The cost is $9,500.
