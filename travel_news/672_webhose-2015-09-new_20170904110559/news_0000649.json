Hinton, whose father took part in the ambush in Arcadia on May 23, 1934. Exhibits include a shotgun and a strongbox taken from the \"death car,\" and newspaper articles about Bonnie and Clyde. \nCarver said Thursday the landlord told him he could patch the roof instead of paying rent, but the building needs a new roof. \nLandlord James Walker of Denver could not immediately be reached for comment. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:29:24.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
