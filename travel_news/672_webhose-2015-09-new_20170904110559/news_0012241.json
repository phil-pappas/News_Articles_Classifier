For the quarter, this translated into an adjusted net loss of $8.1 million , or $0.32 per share. In 2015 year to date, our focus remained on maintaining our efficiency in our operating and cost control performance. As a result, for the six months ended June 30, 2015 , we reported a fleet utilization of 99.1% and an average daily adjusted total vessel operating expenses of $5,746 , or 11.1% lower year-over-year.\"\nMr. Bodouroglou continued, \"Considering the adverse market conditions, a special committee, formed by the Company's independent directors, decided that it was in the Company's and its shareholders best interest to sell four vessels, namely the M/V Dream Seas, the M/V Gentle Seas, the M/V Peaceful Seas and the M/V Friendly Seas, so as to improve its liquidity. Following such sale that was concluded in July 2015 , there has been an immediate cash inflow into the Company of more than $6.0 million representing the net proceeds from the sale after the extinguishment of all existing indebtedness of these four vessels. Also, going forward, it is estimated that there should be additional cash flow savings from this sale given the debt service requirements of these vessels. In addition, in the second quarter of 2015, we sold our share in Box Ships Inc. and in Korea Line Corporation. The total proceeds from the sale of these shares amounted to $3.9 million in the aggregate.\"\nMr. Bodouroglou concluded, \"We remain confident that the market will recover from the prolonged downturn that it is currently facing. Nonetheless, we have taken great strides to ensure the Company's sustainability even if current conditions persist throughout 2016.\"\nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Results\nGross charter revenue for the second quarter of 2015 was $9.9 million , compared to $14.7 million for the second quarter of 2014. The Company reported a net loss of $72.9 million , or $2.93 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of 2015, calculated based on a weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding for the period of 24,460,642 and reflecting the impact of the non-cash items discussed below. For the second quarter of 2014, the Company reported a net loss of $9.7 million , or $0.39 per basic and diluted share, calculated based on a weighted average number of basic and diluted shares of 24,281,164.\nExcluding all non-cash items described below, the adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $8.1 million , or $0.32 per basic and diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $5.6 million , or $0.23 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of 2014.\nAdjusted EBITDA, excluding all non-cash items described below, was negative $0.6 million for the second quarter of 2015, compared to positive $0.9 million for the second quarter of 2014.\nThe Company operated an average of 16.0 vessels during the second quarter of 2015, earning an average TCE rate of $5,494 per day, compared to an average of 14.0 vessels during the second quarter of 2014, earning an average TCE rate of $7,870 per day.\nAdjusted total vessel operating expenses, which included vessel operating expenses, management fees and general and administrative expenses, and excluded share-based compensation, were $8.4 million for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $8.1 million for the second quarter of 2014. On a daily basis, adjusted total vessel operating expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were approximately $5,781 per vessel per day, or 9.5% lower than the adjusted total vessel operating expenses of $6,388 per vessel per day for the second quarter of 2014. The reduction in the average daily adjusted total vessel operating expenses is the result of the Company's cost control efficiency and the economies of scale of having a larger fleet, as well as of a favorable impact of the Euro / U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe loss related to assets held for sale of $47.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , mainly relates to the write down to fair value of the M/V Dream Seas, the M/V Gentle Seas, the M/V Peaceful Seas and the M/V Friendly Seas, following their classification as assets held for sale as of June 30, 2015 .\nBased on the Company's cash flow projections, it is probable that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities will not be sufficient to cover the capital expenditures relating to the Company's newbuilding contracts that become due in the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2016 . Thus, as of June 30, 2015 , the Company assessed as probable the potential sale of the five newbuilding contracts. As a result of this increased probability, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $16.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 , which relates to the write down to fair value of the contract price of the five newbuilding drybulk carriers.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, the Company proceeded with the sale of the total 3,437,500 shares of Box Ships Inc. (NYSE:TEU) (\"Box Ships\") at an average sale price of $0.8542 per share, which resulted in a loss on investment in affiliates of $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 . The proceeds from the sale of such shares amounted to $2.9 million .\nFurthermore, in the second quarter of 2015, the Company proceeded with the sale of the total 44,550 shares of Korea Line Corporation (\"KLC\") at an average sale price of $21.68 per share. The total cash received from the sale of these shares amounted to $1.0 million , net of commissions. A loss from marketable securities, net, of $0.1 million was recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2015 .\nSecond Quarter 2015 Non-cash and One-off Items\nThe Company's results for the three months ended June 30, 2015 included the following non-cash items:\nLoss related to assets held for sale of $47.6 million , or $1.91 per basic and diluted share. Impairment loss of $16.8 million , or $0.67 per basic and diluted share. Loss from marketable securities of $0.1 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share. Loss on investment in affiliate of $0.2 million or $0.01 per basic and diluted share. Unrealized gain on interest rate swaps of $0.1 million , or less than $0.01 per basic and diluted share. Non-cash expenses of $0.3 million , or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, relating to the amortization of the compensation cost recognized for non-vested share awards issued to executive officers, directors and employees. In the aggregate, these non-cash items decreased the Company's earnings by $64.8 million , which represents a $2.61 decrease in earnings per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2015 .\nSix Months ended June 30, 2015 Financial Results\nGross charter revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $20.6 million , compared to $28.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 . The Company reported a net loss of $81.8 million , or $3.29 per basic and diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2015 , calculated based on a weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding for the period of 24,460,642 and reflecting the impact of the non-cash items discussed below. For the six months ended June 30, 2014 , the Company reported a net loss of $35.5 million , or $1.56 per basic and diluted share, calculated based on a weighted average number of basic and diluted shares of 22,414,824.\nExcluding all non-cash items described below, the adjusted net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $16.8 million , or $0.68 per basic and diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $11.6 million , or $0.51 per basic and diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2014 .\nAdjusted EBITDA, excluding all non-cash items described below, was negative $2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 , compared to positive $1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 .\nThe Company operated an average of 16.0 vessels during the six months ended June 30, 2015 , earning an average TCE rate of $5,148 per day, compared to an average of 14.0 vessels during the six months ended June 30, 2014 , earning an average TCE rate of $8,208 per day.\nAdjusted total vessel operating expenses, which included vessel operating expenses, management fees and general and administrative expenses, and excluded share-based compensation, were $16.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 , compared to $16.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 . On a daily basis, adjusted total vessel operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were approximately $5,746 per vessel per day, or 11.1% lower than the adjusted total vessel operating expenses of $6,463 per vessel per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014 . The reduction in the average daily adjusted total vessel operating expenses is the result of the Company's cost control efficiency and the economies of scale of having a larger fleet, as well as of a favorable impact of the Euro / U.S. dollar exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe loss related to assets held for sale of $47.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 , mainly relates to the write down to fair value of the M/V Dream Seas, the M/V Gentle Seas, the M/V Peaceful Seas and the M/V Friendly Seas, following their classification as assets held for sale as of June 30, 2015 .\nBased on the Company's cash flow projections, it is probable that cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities will not be sufficient to cover the capital expenditures relating to the Company's newbuilding contracts that become due in the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2016 .

Non-cash expenses of $0.5 million , or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, relating to the amortization of the compensation cost recognized for non-vested share awards issued to executive officers, directors and employees. In the aggregate, these non-cash items decreased the Company's earnings by $65.0 million , which represents a $2.61 decrease in earnings per basic and diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2015 .\nCash Flows\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2015 , the Company's net cash used in operating activities was $2.7 million , compared to $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014 . For the six months ended June 30, 2015 , net cash from investing activities was $11.4 million and net cash used in financing activities was $11.5 million . For the six months ended June 30, 2014 , net cash used in investing activities was $63.9 million and net cash from financing activities was $55.2 million .\nFleet Developments\nOn June 25, 2015 , a special committee consisting of the Company's five independent directors (\"Special Committee\") was assigned to investigate the potential block sale of four vessels of the Company's operating fleet, the M/V Dream Seas, the M/V Gentle Seas, the M/V Peaceful Seas and the M/V Friendly Seas, for the purpose of improving the Company's liquidity. The Special Committee determined it to be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to sell the vessel-owning subsidiaries of these vessels to an entity controlled by Mr. Michael Bodouroglou , the Company's Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. In July 2015 , the Special Committee and Mr. Bodouroglou agreed to an aggregate sale price of $63.2 million for the sale of all of the issued and registered shares of the respective vessel-owning subsidiaries. The Special Committee determined that the purchase price represented fair market value for the assets to be sold, based on vessel valuations received from independent shipbrokers. The sale and transfer of the respective vessel-owning subsidiaries were concluded on July 27, 2015 .\nFinancing Update\nOn July 31, 2015 , the Company entered into a loan supplemental agreement and agreed, subject to certain conditions included therein, to amended terms with the syndicate led by Nordea Bank Finland Plc, including the deferral of one and a portion of two of its scheduled quarterly installments due in the third quarter of 2015 through the first quarter of 2016. The deferred amounts will be settled along with the balloon installment. The Company also agreed to cancel the available borrowing capacity of up to $78.0 million with respect to the undrawn portion of the facility for the partial financing of its outstanding newbuilding contracts. In addition, effective from April 1, 2015 until March 31, 2016 , the syndicate agreed to either waive the application or amend the definition of the financial and security cover ratio covenants contained in the respective facility.\nOn July 27, 2015 , following the sale of all of the issued and registered shares of the vessel-owning subsidiaries of the M/V Dream Seas, M/V Gentle Seas, M/V Peaceful Seas and M/V Friendly Seas to an entity controlled by Mr. Michael Bodouroglou as discussed above, the Company proceeded with the extinguishment of the then outstanding indebtedness with HSBC Bank Plc and HSH Nordbank AG, amounting to $56.4 million in the aggregate.\nNewbuilding Contracts Update\nCurrently, the Company's outstanding newbuilding contracts consist of two Ultramax drybulk carriers, with expected deliveries between the third and fourth quarter of 2015, and three Kamsarmax drybulk carriers with expected deliveries in the first quarter of 2016. The aggregate cost of the newbuilding contracts is $148.2 million , of which $101.7 million is currently outstanding.\nBased on the Company's cash flow projections, cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities will not be sufficient to cover the capital expenditures relating to the Company's newbuilding contracts that become due in the twelve-month period ending June 30, 2016 . Thus, as of June 30, 2015 , the Company assessed as probable the potential sale of the five newbuilding contracts. As a result of this increased probability, an impairment loss of $16.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2015.\nConference Call and Webcast details\nThe Company's management team will host a conference call to discuss its results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2015 on September 2, 2015 , at 9:00 am Eastern Time .\nParticipants should dial into the call ten minutes before the scheduled time using the following numbers 1-888-348-8931 ( USA ) or +1-412-902-4248 (international) to access the call.

Any idle days relating to the days a vessel remains unemployed are included in operating days.\n(5)\nFleet utilization is the percentage of time that our vessels were able to generate revenues and is determined by dividing operating days by fleet available days for the relevant period.\n(6)\nTime charter equivalent (\"TCE\") is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. Our method of calculating TCE is consistent with industry standards and is determined by dividing Net Revenue generated from charters less voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses consist of all costs that are unique to a particular voyage, primarily including port expenses, canal dues, war risk insurances and fuel costs, net of gains or losses from the sale of bunkers to charterers. TCE is a non-GAAP standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot voyage charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods.\n(7)\nDaily vessel operating expenses, which includes crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs, is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(8)\nDaily management fees - related party adjusted are calculated by dividing management fees - related party, excluding share based compensation to the management company, by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(9)\nDaily general and administrative expenses adjusted are calculated by dividing general and administrative expenses, excluding non-cash expenses relating to the amortization of the share based compensation cost for non-vested share awards, by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(10)\nTotal vessel operating expenses (\"TVOE\") is a measurement of our total expenses associated with operating our vessels. TVOE is the sum of vessel operating expenses, management fees and general and administrative expenses. Daily TVOE adjusted is calculated by dividing TVOE, excluding non-cash expenses relating to the amortization of the share based compensation cost for non-vested share awards and share based compensation to the management company, by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\nTime Charter Equivalents Reconciliation\n(Expressed in thousands of United States Dollars where applicable, except for TCE)\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30, 2014\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30, 2015\nSix Months\nEnded\nJune 30, 2014\nSix Months\nEnded\nJune 30, 2015\nCharter Revenue\n14,666\n9,945\n28,903\n20,630\nCommissions\n(842)\n(599)\n(1,650)\n(1,250)\nVoyage Expenses, net\n(4,081)\n(1,489)\n(7,259)\n(4,692)\nNet Revenue, net of voyage expenses\n9,743\n7,857\n19,994\n14,688\nTotal operating days\n1,238\n1,430\n2,436\n2,853\nTime Charter Equivalent\n7,870\n5,494\n8,208\n5,148\nCondensed Cash Flow Information (Unaudited)\n(Expressed in thousands of United States Dollars)\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30, 2014\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30, 2015\nCash generated from / (used in):\nOperating Activities\n(341)\n(2,670)\nInvesting Activities\n(63,927)\n11,382\nFinancing Activities\n55,169\n(11,526)\nReconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation (1)\n(Expressed in thousands of United States Dollars)\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30, 2014\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30, 2015\nSix Months\nEnded\nJune 30, 2014\nSix Months\nEnded\nJune 30, 2015\nNet Loss\n(9,652)\n(72,906)\n(35,537)\n(81,838)\nPlus Net interest expense, including interest expense from interest rate swaps\n3,009\n2,457\n5,415\n4,841\nPlus Depreciation\n4,485\n4,984\n8,912\n9,911\nEBITDA\n(2,158)\n(65,465)\n(21,210)\n(67,086)\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nNet Loss\n(9,652)\n(72,906)\n(35,537)\n(81,838)\nLoss related to assets held for sale\n-\n47,640\n-\n47,640\nImpairment loss\n-\n16,754\n15,695\n16,754\nGain from sale of assets\n(403)\n-\n(403)\n-\n(Gain) / loss from marketable securities\n(12)\n134\n(12)\n134\nLoss on investment in affiliate\n3,101\n207\n5,855\n207\nUnrealized loss / (gain) on interest rate swaps\n108\n(150)\n(69)\n(210)\nNon-cash expenses from the amortization of share based compensation cost recognized and share based compensation to the management company\n246\n255\n1,359\n491\nWrite off of financing expenses\n1,028\n-\n1,511\n-\nAdjusted Net Loss\n(5,584)\n(8,066)\n(11,601)\n(16,822)\nPlus Net interest expense, net of write off of financing expenses, including interest expense from swaps\n1,981\n2,457\n3,904\n4,841\nPlus Depreciation\n4,485\n4,984\n8,912\n9,911\nAdjusted EBITDA\n882\n(625)\n1,215\n(2,070)\n(1)\nThe Company considers EBITDA to represent Net Income / (Loss) plus net interest expense, including interest expense from interest rate swaps, and depreciation and amortization. The Company's management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not items recognized by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to Net Income / (Loss), Operating Income / (Loss) or any other indicator of a Company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP. The Company's definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as that used by other companies in the shipping or other industries. The Company believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because the shipping industry is capital intensive and may involve significant financing costs. The Company excluded non-cash items to derive the Adjusted Net Income / (Loss) and the Adjusted EBITDA because the Company believes that these adjustments provide additional information on the fleet operational results.\nReconciliation of U.S. GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted Net Income / (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings / (Loss) per common share Reconciliation\n(Expressed in thousands of United States Dollars - except for shares and share data)\nU.S. GAAP Financial Information\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30, 2014\nQuarter Ended\nJune 30, 2015\nSix Months\nEnded\nJune 30, 2014\nSix Months\nEnded\nJune 30, 2015\nNet Loss\n(9,652)\n(72,906)\n(35,537)\n(81,838)\nNet Loss attributable to non-vested share awards\n(133)\n(1,313)\n(571)\n(1,363)\nNet Loss available to common shareholders\n(9,519)\n(71,593)\n(34,966)\n(80,475)\nWeighted average number of common shares basic and diluted\n24,281,164\n24,460,642\n22,414,824\n24,460,642\nLoss per common share basic and diluted\n(0.39)\n(2.93)\n(1.56)\n(3.29)\nReconciliation of Net Income / (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income / (Loss)\nNet Loss\n(9,652)\n(72,906)\n(35,537)\n(81,838)\nLoss related to assets held for sale\n-\n47,640\n-\n47,640\nImpairment loss\n-\n16,754\n15,695\n16,754\nGain from sale of assets\n(403)\n-\n(403)\n-\n(Gain) / loss from marketable securities\n(12)\n134\n(12)\n134\nLoss on investment in affiliate\n3,101\n207\n5,855\n207\nUnrealized loss / (gain) on interest rate swaps\n108\n(150)\n(69)\n(210)\nNon-cash expenses from the amortization of share based compensation cost recognized and share based compensation to the management company\n246\n255\n1,359\n491\nWrite off of financing expenses\n1,028\n-\n1,511\n-\nAdjusted Net Loss (1)\n(5,584)\n(8,066)\n(11,601)\n(16,822)\nAdjusted Net Loss attributable to non-vested share awards\n(77)\n(145)\n(186)\n(280)\nAdjusted Net Loss available to common shareholders\n(5,507)\n(7,921)\n(11,415)\n(16,542)\nWeighted average number of common shares basic and diluted\n24,281,164\n24,460,642\n22,414,824\n24,460,642\nAdjusted Loss per common share basic and diluted (1)\n(0.23)\n(0.32)\n(0.51)\n(0.68)\n(1)\nAdjusted Net Income / (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings / (Loss) per common share are not items recognized by U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to Net Income / (Loss) and Earnings / (Loss) per common share, respectively, or any other indicator of a Company's operating performance required by U.S. GAAP.
