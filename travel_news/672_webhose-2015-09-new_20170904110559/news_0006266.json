Its Old Town contains almost two thousand medieval, gothic, renaissance, and baroque buildings, and it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1994.\nWizz Air first moved to Glasgow Airport in March 2013 and the addition of these two new routes brings the total number of destinations it serves from Glasgow to eight. It currently operates services to the Polish cities of Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice and Gdansk and the Hungarian capital, Budapest. Last week it announced it will begin a new route to the Romanian capital of Bucharest in 2016.\nPaul White, business development manager at Glasgow Airport, said: “This is yet further good news from Wizz Air which has gone from strength-to-strength since its arrival at Glasgow Airport two years ago. It has continued to respond to demand by adding direct flights to popular European destinations and these two new services will no doubt prove extremely popular with our passengers.”\nGlasgow Airport has secured 25 new routes and services in 2015 including direct flights to Halifax, Nova Scotia; Milan, Prague, Las Vegas and Budapest.\nSource:- Wizz Air", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T14:57:41.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
