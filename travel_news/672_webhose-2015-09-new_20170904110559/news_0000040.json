Opening in 2018, Hotel Jen Kota Kinabalu will be strategically positioned in PacifiCity, an integrated shopping, entertainment and lifestyle hub located along the coastal highway in scenic Kota Kinabalu, the gateway city to Sabah and wider Borneo.\nThe announcement was made at a signing ceremony held at Shangri-La’s Tanjung Aru Resort & Spa, Kota Kinabalu.\nMr. KP Kuok, Executive Director of Pacific Sanctuary Holdings Sdn Bhd, said: “The Shangri-La Group was one of the pioneer investors in Sabah’s tourism industry and has attained a reputation as a highly regarded brand by Sabahans and visitors to Sabah alike. Hotel Jen Kota Kinabalu will be an extension of this, providing another strong brand to meet the new demand from business visitors and international tourists.”\n“Tourism has provided Sabahans from all walks of life opportunities to find fulfilling employment and to develop professional careers. When counting indirect jobs, the industry is one of the biggest employers here. This is a significant reason why we decided to invest in hotels and resorts in Sabah. They bring long-lasting employment and benefits to the community,” Kuok added.\nMr. Greg Dogan, president and CEO of Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, said: “The announcement of Hotel Jen Kota Kinabalu is extremely important for our organisation. We’ve built a strong presence in Kota Kinabalu and throughout Malaysia, and are delighted the newest brand in our portfolio reinforces our commitment to Sabah, Borneo and beyond.”\nFresh, friendly and fuss-free. That’s the genre of Hotel Jen , the new brand launched a year ago to cater to a new ‘Jeneration’ of independently minded business and leisure travellers. Launching quickly with the first ten Hotel Jen properties opening in major cities in Asia Pacific in under one year, today’s announcement marks a significant milestone in the growth of the brand that has been recognised by the travel trade as the brand that has revolutionised the hotel industry.\n“The Hotel Jen experience delivers what matters most to guests. They appreciate important things done well; demand quality, comfort and value, together with honest, authentic service; and want privacy and efficiency without unnecessary fuss or intrusion. In this highly desirable location for business and leisure travellers, Hotel Jen is well positioned to offer guests to Kota Kinabalu more flexibility, as busy non-traditional work hours tend to blend the boundaries between business and leisure,” Dogan added.\nPacifiCity is a premier shopping, entertainment and lifestyle hub located in picturesque Likas Bay, an area described as the new city centre of Kota Kinabalu. The development is opposite Sabah Trade Centre and near the new Sabah International Convention Centre currently under construction.\nLo cated on top of PacifiCity’s lifestyle mall, Hotel Jen Kota Kinabalu will connect guests to world-class shopping, dining and entertainment. Its prominent position offers stunning views of the South China Sea, coastal wetlands and majestic Mount Kinabalu.\nHotel Jen Kota Kinabalu will comprise twin iconic towers, drawing its design inspiration from the surrounding environment and local culture, consistent with Hotel Jen’s style philosophy. The Hotel will also boast resort-standard recreation and fitness facilities that are shared with the PacifiCity Club.\n“We are excited to work with the Shangri-La group to bring Hotel Jen to Kota Kinabalu,” said Mr. Jonathan Wheeler, managing director of Pacific Sanctuary Holdings Sdn. Bhd.\n“Hotel Jen Kota Kinabalu will be the jewel in the crown of PacifiCity, cementing the development as a premium integrated hub, benefiting all stakeholders, tenants and investors,” Wheeler added.\nIn addition to the presence of Hotel Jen, PacifiCity promises something different for visitors and local patrons.\nWheeler continued, “We have focused on ‘retail-tainment’ and experiential dining. PacifiCity will bring a variety of exciting new cuisines and restaurants to Sabah; our shopping mall will also be the first to offer an IMAX cinema, in addition to a number of family-friendly entertainment concepts perfect for tourists or local patrons.”\n“Our goal is to blend the spending power of international tourists, whether they be here for business or leisure, with the sustainable business of patrons from the local community,” explained Wheeler.\nL othar Nessmann, chief operations officer of the Hotel Jen brand, said: “We are excited to expand Hotel Jen’s footprint in Asia Pacific and Hotel Jen Kota Kinabalu will join ten hotels in key locations in the region, including the third in Malaysia.\n“The PacifiCity Club concept adds a unique experience for business and leisure travellers, including Golden Circle members,” added Nessmann.\nKey Facts\nHotel Jen Kota Kinabalu\n· 440 Rooms\n· Jen’s Kitchen , all-day dining, overlooking the pool\n· Lobby Lounge and roof top bar\n· State-of-the-art fitness centre\n· Meeting and convention facilities, including a column-less ballroom\n· A Club Lounge with privileges, including express check-in and check-out, complimentary breakfast, complimentary evening beverages and tasty local snacks and late check-out\nThe PacifiCity Club, managed by Hotel Jen Kota Kinabalu · A luxurious facility offering PacifiCity residents and non-resident members exclusive club benefits\n· More than 75-metre resort-style pool and state-of-the-art recreational facilities\n· Family-friendly zone, including a children’s pool and play area\n· Private club lounge with bistro, lounge and alfresco café\nSource:- Shangri-la", "external_links": ["http://www.hoteljen.com/"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:55:44.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
