Credit: Megan Ellis \nNational Parks Week is almost over, but there's another week on its way which will give you more free access to beautiful places. \nThis time it comes in the form of CapeNature Access Week, which will give visitors free access to all CapeNature reserves from September 21 to September 27. \nAccess to activities like day hiking, white river rafting with your own canoe, mountain biking with your own bicycle and picnicking will also be free. \nNo prior bookings will be taken. \nCapeNature reserves are spread across the Western Cape, with reserves located in the Karoo, Winelands, the Overberg, the Garden Route and the West Coast. \nThe list of CapeNature reserves is quite lengthy, giving you more than enough places you can visit. You can see the list here . \nWe can personally attest to the beauty of the Walker Bay Reserve. \nOther reserves you can visit include the Stony Point Nature Reserve, Grootvadersbosch Nature Reserve and Kogelberg Nature Reserve. \nCapeNature Access Week however does not waive accommodation, camping and multi-day hike fees.
