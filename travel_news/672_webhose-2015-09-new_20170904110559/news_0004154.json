Centara’s new property will offer a full range of services that will allow for every guest to enjoy their stay.\nThe new property features 282 rooms, suites and residences in total, all designed with a fresh modern style, incorporating clean lines, light wood furnishings and splashes of vivid colors. All offer free Wi-Fi, and comfortable living spaces of up to 60 square meters with the option of garden or ocean views.
