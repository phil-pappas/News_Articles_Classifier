Olsen Cruise Lines unveils ‘The Bookmark Cafe’ across its fleet Published on : Thursday, September 10, 2015\nFred. Olsen Cruise Lines is pleased to announce the launch of its onboard coffee and luxury chocolate shops as ‘The Bookmark Café’. Fred. Olsen first introduced this relaxing, sociable area across its fleet of four smaller, more intimate ships – Balmoral, Braemar, Boudicca and Black Watch – during the ships’ dry-docks in 2013 and 2014. This popular addition to the onboard facilities – which adjoins the ships’ Libraries – serves a delicious selection of specialty coffees and teas from world-renowned Taylors of Harrogate, as well as high-quality Pralines, Champagne Truffles and other hand-made chocolates.\nNathan Philpot, Sales and Marketing Director for Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, said:\n“The concept for ‘Bookmark Café’ stems from where the coffee shops are positioned on each ship, and the brand has a classic and simple design, which complements the stylish décor on board.\n“We have received fantastic feedback since we introduced the four Bookmark Cafés across our fleet, and they have quickly become firm favourites with our guests. Each one is located right at the heart of the ship, and retains a sociable and relaxing atmosphere for guests to pass the time with a luxurious latte or Taylors’ loose leaf tea, and delicious, hand-made chocolates as an extra treat. In fact, our chocolates have proved so popular that we find many guests take them home to share with friends and family!”\nFood, drink and the overall dining experience are of great importance on board a Fred. Olsen cruise, and its team of expert Chefs are very proud to have been awarded the Holiday & Cruise Channel’s prestigious ‘Telly Award’ for ‘Britain’s Best Cruise Line for Food’.\nThe Bookmark Cafés are located on Lounge Deck 7 on board Balmoral – Fred. Olsen’s flagship – on Lounge Deck 5 on Braemar, on Lido Deck 7 on Boudicca, and on Lido Deck 7 on Black Watch.\nFred. Olsen is pleased to have been awarded the ‘Gold Trusted Merchant’ status by independent review site Feefo in 2015, for the second year in a row. This accreditation is based on genuine customer feedback and, to date, Fred. Olsen has received over 12,000 reviews, with 95% of these being in the ‘Good’ or ‘Excellent’ categories.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:06:58.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
