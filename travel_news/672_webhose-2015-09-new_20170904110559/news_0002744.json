Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Corresponden | Sep 21, 2015   \nA Cessna 150L earlier today crashed shortly after takeoff from Nairobi’s Wilson Airport into the adjoining national park, injuring both the instructor and the trainee pilot. Following the accident, which occurred at around 1100 hours, a rescue team was dispatched and both occupants of the aircraft evacuated from the wreck and taken to hospital. Registered as 5Y-CDQ, MSN 150-75660, the aircraft is, according to information sources, owned by Skymax Aviation Limited, a flight training school based at Nairobi’s second commercial airport. Year of manufacture was established as 1974. \nNo reasons have been suggested yet for the crash landing and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and other relevant authorities have started the process of an air accident investigation to establish the cause of the accident. \nWilson Airport is often described as Africa’s busiest airport with dozens of daily scheduled departures to the various national parks across the country, as well as numerous charters and medivac flights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T00:25:47.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
