Referred to by a recent travel industry report as \"shopping safaris\" - this type of vacation is on the rise, most notably among Chinese nationals. \nThe 2015 Tourism & Travel Trends Report from Resonance Consultancy identifies shopping safaris as one of many growing trends to watch, revealing for example that 27% of Chinese tourists abroad spend more on shopping when traveling than anything else. And one of the most popular shopping oriented vacation destinations, according to the report, is the United States. \nSo while the U.S. may have plenty of sights to offer tourists -- the Grand Canyon or the Statue of Liberty -- they are less popular with some Chinese travelers then days spent at discount outlets and malls. \n\"It's not unusual for them to fill an entire extra suitcase,\" says Gary Young, who regularly hosts Chinese tourists, thanks to his role as president and CEO of Avela Corporation, a company that has offices in China and Texas and specializes in helping American companies make purchases in Asia. 1 of 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:31:13.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
