The 53rd annual event, which is one of the largest outdoor festivals in the Southwest, will raise funds for the Boulder City Hospital Foundation. More than 100,000 visitors are expected to explore the Historic downtown area and peruse the work of artists in fine art, fine craft and traditional craft categories. All proceeds will benefit the Boulder City Hospital.\nIn addition to unique artworks, Art in the Park will include more than 25 food and beverage vendors. There will also be live music, demonstrations and activities. Each artist will donate one of their pieces for a fundraising raffle as well. Ribbons will be given to artists in first, second and third place in fine art, fine craft and traditional craft categories, as well as a “best in show” winner.\nEach year, a featured artist is named for Art in the Park. This year’s featured artist is Robert Marble, a self-taught cartoonist. Marble is one of today’s noted contemporary humorous artists, who uses satire to make people laugh. His work can be viewed in booth 70 throughout the weekend.\nArt in the Park is free and open to the public. Free parking is available throughout the city, but there will also be paid parking lots with complimentary shuttle service to the event. Paid parking is located as you enter Boulder City, off of U.S. 93 and Veterans Memorial Drive.\nJournalists and news organizations: Photographs from the 2014 Art in the Park available here. Check back Oct. 5 for images from this year’s event.\nSource:- LVCVA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T21:36:15.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
