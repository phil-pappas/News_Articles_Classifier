They said we could take some money or move to a different house,\" said Huang, dapper in a navy flat cap and gold Chinese-style high-collared shirt. \n\"But I didn't want to move. This is the only real home I've ever known in Taiwan.\" \nThe settlement in the Nantun district of Taichung City once comprised 1,200 homes for veterans and their families. \nBut as the decades-old accommodation became run-down, developers snapped up the land and residents were offered Tw$2 million (US$61,000, RM254,492) compensation or new housing. \nHuang has lived there for 37 years, staying even after his neighbours abandoned their homes and only 11 houses remained. \nThat's when he decided to paint. \n\"I was the only person left in the village and I was bored,\" he said. \n\"My father taught me how to paint when I was five years old, but I hadn't done it since I was a child. \n\"The first thing I painted was a bird inside my house.\" \nPiece of history \nHuang decorated the interior of his two-bedroom bungalow, then the outer walls and the neighbouring homes which were standing empty. \nThe ever-expanding artwork became a parade of dogs, cats, planes and his favourite celebrities, including kung fu legend Bruce Lee. \nWhen local university students discovered Huang's work they launched a campaign to save the village and four years ago the authorities agreed it should be preserved. \nNow it is one of the area's leading tourist attractions, pulling in more than a million visitors annually, mostly from Asia. \n\"The government has promised me they will keep this house and this village,\" said Huang. \n\"I was so happy and thankful.\" \nOfficials say they are seeking to make the \"Rainbow Village\" a designated cultural area. \n\"Tourism is one of the reasons to keep it, but the main reason is that veterans' villages are very special to Taiwan,\" says Huang Ming-heng, chief secretary of Taichung's cultural affairs bureau. \n\"Unfortunately most of them have been knocked down, so it's important to keep this historical memory.\" \nOn a scorching Tuesday morning, tourists of all ages take selfies in front of the murals. \n\"I think they are amazing graphics – this place should be preserved,\" said Hsiao Chi, 19, a student from Taipei. \n\"The colour and the drawings are very special,\" added Ivy Ng, 30, from Hong Kong, who was visiting Taichung with her family. \nDying communities \nOriginally from Hong Kong, Huang joined the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) army in 1946 to fight communist troops in mainland China during the civil war there. \nWhen the KMT was defeated in 1949, many troops followed its leader, Chiang Kai-shek, as he fled to Taiwan. \nThey were given temporary housing in hundreds of dedicated military villages across the island, a stop-gap while the nationalists regrouped. \nBut as the communists tightened their grip on the mainland, these temporary homes became permanent. \nThe Ministry of National Defence says many of the villages have been knocked down because residents wanted better living conditions. \nBut some bemoan the loss of the old communities. \n\"When they move out, people feel isolated,\" said Kang Han-ming, a former marine who manages the thriving Rainbow Village business and campaigns to protect the remaining settlements. \n\"They feel they have no roots. That's why a lot of older veterans who move to new buildings get sick.\" \nThe defence ministry has now pledged to preserve the last 13 villages as cultural areas. \nArtist Huang says he never tires of the early morning regime that served to save his home – a bungalow crammed with paints, marker pens and memorabilia. \nThe Rainbow Grandpa sits back on a chair in the shade and watches the crowds. \n\"I like speaking with them and they tell me the paintings are beautiful. I'll never get lonely with all these visitors.\" – AFP Relaxnews Opinion", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T05:24:54.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
