And where the road was once narrow, unpaved, and reached only critical substations, today it is being widened and extended to reach all the way to customer premises, as well as accommodate many more and larger travelers (data and applications) moving at ever higher speeds.Although communications in the grid are not a new phenomenon, the demands upon these communications networks are growing and changing rapidly. Meanwhile, the need for security in these networks has never been greater, as the increased connectivity of critical grid infrastructure creates potential vulnerabilities. The market for smart grid networking and communications technology thus includes a growing number of competitors with a multitude of solutions and equipment. Yet, even as new or upgraded solutions are unveiled, the market is moving toward a smaller number of standards for most major applications: advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), distribution automation (DA), and substation automation (SA). According to Navigant Research, cumulative global revenue for smart grid communications networking and communications equipment is expected to amount to more than $29 billion between 2014 and 2023.This Navigant Research report analyzes the global market for smart grid networking and communications technology. The study provides a detailed analysis of market drivers and challenges, technical considerations, and key infrastructure vendors and service providers associated with communications infrastructure and services for smart grid applications. Global market forecasts for shipments, average selling prices (ASPs), and revenue, segmented by application, device type, technology, and region, extend through 2023. The report also examines spectrum availability and cyber security requirements, as well as regional factors affecting relative shares among the major communications technologies. Key Questions Addressed: Which smart grid communications platforms are gaining share - and in which markets?What are the key market drivers behind smart grid applications and what are their communications requirements?What are the technical specifications for the major smart grid communications platforms?Where are public communications platforms - wired and wireless - gaining the most ground?Where are private, utility-owned solutions still the leading choice?How large is the market for smart grid communications and how quickly will it grow over the next decade?
