The availability of cheaper treatment and pharmaceutical products as compared to their Western World counterparts and a strong qualified network of doctors specialists and world-class hospitals continue to be a beacon for foreign nationals looking for a cure for their illnesses. People are also increasingly opting for alternative remedies offered by Ayurveda Unani Acupuncture Homeopathy and Yoga. The availability of the advanced Western Medicine along with a host of proven alternative therapies has given the country an advantage over other nations which are jumping into the bandwagon.Much has been written over the cost advantages India offers to foreign nationals for their treatment. What has been left unsaid is that these advantages are increasing as more and more players enter the space to take advantage of the burgeoning industry. Some of the biggest business names in the country such as Apollo Fortis Max Reliance Tata and Wockhardt continue to pump in more capital to increase their presence and continuously improve their services. It is estimated that the Indian healthcare industry will have an estimated market value of USD 280 billion by the end of this decade.The growth of the industry in the future can be seen from the rise in FDI in the space. For instance the hospitals and diagnostics segment has received FDI of USD 2.2 billion while surgical appliances / medical devices received USD 741.8 million in the period 2000-2013. The Indian majors are also moving towards international alliances to take advantage of the available opportunities.The rise of the industry has helped Indian doctors receive a global exposure. Specialists are looking at patients and case histories from around the world and getting an idea of what went wrong and what needs to be done. Though not quantifiable due to various factors this increased knowledge-base is helping Indian doctors gain a more significant presence in the global medical community. Also the ubiquitous presence of the internet and mobile phones has allowed foreign nationals to access Indian specialists from their homes and come to India only for their surgery. This trend is expected to continue in the future as specialists leverage technology to check patients from India and around the world and treat their illnesses.About My Global HospitalMy Global Hospital makes the world truly flat for healthcare and medical tourism.
