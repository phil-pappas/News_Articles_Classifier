Lithuania has been asked to accept 1105 refugees from Syria Iraq and Eritrea over the next two years. The first refugees could be relocated to Lithuania from Italy as early as this year the Baltic country's officials said. \n\n\"We are solid solidary and rich therefore we should not feel burdened to share the responsibility within Europe in order to guarantee refugees' safety\" Mogherini said. \n\nThe EU will soon be able to give \"constructive news\" to the world she noted. \n\nThe Italian diplomat also stressed that she \"appreciates the position of Lithuania of sharing responsibility and expressing solidarity.\" \n\nMogherini met with Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius and Minister of Foreign Affairs Linas Linkevicius. \n\n\"We welcome the European Commission's proposals to better manage the migration flows and ensure the prevention of further aggravations we also look forward to the decisions by the interior ministers council\" Butkevicius said after the meeting. \n\nLinkevicius expressed solidarity with EU member states in response to migration challenges and addressing the causes of migration. Lithuania has already made the decision on its share of refugee burden he underlined. \n\n\"Special attention should be devoted to address the causes of migration. We must maintain solidarity in the EU in order to overcome the crisis\" Linkevicius was quoted as saying in the ministry's statement. \n\nThe EU's Eastern Partnership issues including the current situation in Ukraine and the EU's support to this country were also discussed during meetings. \n\n\"Europe needs unity today as never before\" President Grybauskaite echoed Mogherini's insights in the statement. \n\nMeanwhile the Lithuanian leader repeatedly expressed her negative stance concerning the EU's permanent mandatory refugees' quota mechanism. \n\nIn her words sharing refugees alone would not solve the problem in substance hence decisions were needed as to how to ensure EU's external border security and to effectively manage migration flows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T12:59:29.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
