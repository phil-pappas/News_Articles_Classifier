Here's a look at the celebs who sailed on the Clyde-built liner From the 1930s to the 1960s, stars of stage and screen were regular passengers on board RMS Queen Mary, relaxing in the opulent surroundings of the legendary Clyde-built Cunard liner. \nActor and comedian Bob Hope was onboard during the Queen Mary’s final passenger voyage, from Southampton to New York, before the start of the Second World War in 1939. \nQueen of the silver screen, Elizabeth Taylor, was a regular traveller on the great Queen and often travelled with her two poodles. While she travelled first class, the kennels were on the sports deck. \n  \nAudrey Hepburn and her husband Mel Ferrer travelled on the Queen Mary on their way to Europe for their second honeymoon on June 17, 1957. \nEdward VIII, the son of the ship’s namesake Queen Mary, often travelled with his wife Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor and called it “their ship.” They booked the same suite for every trip, M58 on the main deck, which is now called the Windsor Suite. During one memorable voyage in 1948, the couple brought with them 120 pieces of luggage - and their dogs.
