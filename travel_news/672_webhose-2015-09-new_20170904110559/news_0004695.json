Kitty Wong, President of the World PCO Alliance, is very excited about the two new members and said on behalf of all the members: “I wish to extend my warmest welcome to our new members, David Tarrab from Mexico and Jan Tonkin from New Zealand, who will not only bring diversity and depth to our Alliance but also further strengthen our dynamic network.” \nThe Conference Company was founded in 1990 by Jan Tonkin as a specialist organiser of international and national association conferences. Today the company works out of offices in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. It also has operations in Australia. The Conference Company’s stated aim is “to create environments that empower our clients to tap into each other’s energy and wisdom and propel forward thinking.” Jan Tonkin, Managing Director, expressed; “In the same way we, as conference organisers, strive to create environments in which our clients can tap into each other’s energy and wisdom, we benefit from being able to tap into colleagues’ know-how and experience. The World PCO Alliance provides an ideal platform to do just that, not only for our collective benefit but for our clients’ as well. We are certainly looking forward to contributing to discussions and collaborating with fellow members.” From Mexico, David Tarrab, General Director of Turismo & Convenciones commented: “Turismo & Convenciones (T&C) is proud to be the new member of World PCO Alliance, a network of leader PCOs from different countries and regions, distinguished by its quality of service and leadership in its local market. T&C is the market leader in Mexico for over 26 years, serving three different segments (corporate, associations and governmental events). During these years T&C has developed partnerships and certifications that have endorsed its processes, quality service and the highest quality standards. Today we celebrate being part of the most important network of PCOs around the world, in which T&C will relaunch an international strategy to strengthen and diversify their creative and technological services applied to conferences, conventions and exhibitions.” The World PCO Alliance was created to help associations organize meetings more efficiently and professionally throughout the globe. Representing the leading PCOs throughout the globe, this cohesive group aims to capitalize on the professional pool of the best-practice conference and event services and form an effective network. By sharing resources, knowledge, technology, training and best practices, the Alliance is the associations' one-stop solution for international meetings and conferences. All members of the Alliance are leaders in the meetings industry in their respective countries and regions, and command a dazzling record of having shaped the local meetings and events industry. The World PCO Alliance provides transparency in all we do, most importantly, in regard to the handling of client funds.
