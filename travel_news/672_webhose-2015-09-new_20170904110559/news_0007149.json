The lightweight system also helps to reduce the amount of fuel used by the aircraft. \nPassengers in World Traveller Plus will now have access to a universal power socket at every seat, while World Traveller customers will have personal USB sockets to power phones and tablets. \nThe refit, which has been carried out by British Airways' engineers in Cardiff, will include a cabin interior refresh including new seat foams in World Traveller and World Traveller Plus to increase customer comfort and new-style seat covers to match those on the A380 and 787. Carpets and curtains throughout the 747s are also being replaced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:38:37.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
