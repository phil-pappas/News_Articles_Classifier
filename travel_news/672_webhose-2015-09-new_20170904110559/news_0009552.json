Daley, citing security concerns following the 9-11 terror attacks, sent backhoes to carve X's into the Meigs Field runway.\nThe city spent $9.7 million to build the park, which features man-made hills, a 5-acre lagoon and a winding bike and pedestrian trail. There are also camping sites and areas for educational programming.\nNortherly Island is actually a peninsula linked by a land bridge that leads to the city's Museum Campus.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:44:32.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
