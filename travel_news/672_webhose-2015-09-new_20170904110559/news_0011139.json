The nine-city tour, which hits the road today, allows flapjack fans in some of the busiest cities in the Southwest and along the West Coast to enjoy a selfie on a pancake made by “The Stack Station,” the brand’s super smart, one-touch pancake machine. The innovative piece of breakfast machinery was named this summer through a crowdsource naming contest in which more than 28,000 wordsmiths suggested their best and brightest monikers for a chance to win bragging rights and a trip to Vermont, maple syrup Heaven.\nJennifer Gribble, Vice President, Holiday Inn Express® Brand, Americas, IHG said: “Everyone knows that breakfast is the most important and smartest meal of the day; everyone also knows that people love selfies. Leveraging state-of-the-art technology, we combined the two to bring the ‘Pancake Selfie Express’ to the masses. This clever concept is the perfect fit for our latest Stay Smart® campaign because it brings our Express Start™ breakfast offering to travelers in a fun and engaging way to show them why the Holiday Inn Express brand is the smart choice. We are excited to send the ‘Pancake Selfie Express’ out on the road, delivering freshly baked, high-tech pancakes and driving breakfast enthusiasm along the way.”\nThe “Pancake Selfie Express” features five push-button pancake machines, each producing one pancake per minute as well as finely-tuned lasers which then imprint selfies taken via mobile phone camera directly onto each pancake. The selfie technology is a first for any hospitality brand. The nine-city tour begins in Dallas at Pegasus Plaza at City Center (Sept. 2-4) before continuing on to Austin (Sept. 6-7), Phoenix (Sept. 11-14), San Diego (Sept. 17-19), Long Beach (Sept. 21-22), Los Angeles (Sept. 24-27), San Francisco (Oct. 2-3), Oakland (Oct. 5-6) and Sacramento (Oct. 9-11). Locals in each city can visit the truck for their own pancake selfie as well as the chance to win breakfast-inspired swag and IHG® Rewards Club points to be applied towards future stays at Holiday Inn Express properties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:43:13.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
