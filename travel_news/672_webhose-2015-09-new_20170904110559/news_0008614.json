The multi-million dollar campaign is the first comprehensive advertising effort for The Luxury Collection since 2011 and features an updated emphasis on experiential luxury, which has also informed the brand’s refreshed visual identity and new logo. This announcement coincides with a $700 million effort led by Starwood and its owner partners to expand and improve the brand’s hotel portfolio around the world, including the renovation of landmark hotels like The Palace Hotel in San Francisco, the conversion of iconic properties including the Augustine in Prague and the grand opening of new hotels such as Suiran in Kyoto.\n“As we enter a period of significant growth for The Luxury Collection, both in the U.S. and abroad, Starwood is making a significant investment to drive profound consumer awareness for the brand’s extraordinary collection of hotels,” said Adam Aron, Chief Executive Officer of Starwood Hotels & Resorts on an interim basis. “We fully recognize the enormous untapped potential of The Luxury Collection, and with this new advertising campaign and brand identity, we are shining an ever brighter spotlight on The Luxury Collection as it becomes the world’s largest luxury hotel brand by year’s end.”\nWith an investment of $4 million in print and digital advertising over the next 12 months, the new campaign captures both destination and hotel in the same frame and brings to life the glamour, authenticity and sense of place that guests experience when they arrive at the storied hotels and resorts of The Luxury Collection. The dynamic vignettes were shot by celebrated photographer Troy House from a guest’s point of view. For instance, Excelsior Hotel Gallia in Milan is captured through the historic Milano Centrale railway station; the Spanish Marques de Riscal is photographed from the bell tower of the 16th century Church of San Andres; and Hotel Imperial is shot through the window of a local trolley passing through Vienna’s famous Ringstrasse. The Luxury Collection will continue to add destinations to its global campaign through the end of the year, including New Delhi, Jaipur, and Agra, as well as San Francisco and Scottsdale.\n“This marks a milestone year for The Luxury Collection brand, with a robust pipeline of global growth and an increasing demand from owners who find tremendous value in partnering with us; so there couldn’t be a better time to introduce a new brand identity capturing the demand for true experiential luxury,” said Hoyt H Harper II, Global Brand Leader, The Luxury Collection Hotels & Resorts. “Our goal with this campaign is to illustrate how our hotels are true representations of their destinations and to celebrate our guests as storytellers, collectors, and explorers.”\nThe campaign launches in October issues of national publications, including Condé Nast Traveller (UK), Departures, Financial Times, Town & Country, Travel + Leisure, and WSJ. Magazine and will be featured in magazines, including Bloomberg Pursuits, Centurion, Departures and Robb Report into next year. In addition to top-tier titles in the United States and the United Kingdom, the campaign will roll out globally in Mexico, Argentina, Austria, Germany, China and Japan.\nComplementing the campaign, The Luxury Collection is also unveiling a new brand logo which connotes a stamp of excellence in a letterpress typeface that was inspired by the craftsmanship of engraving stone. A new website, brand collateral and signage at each of The Luxury Collection hotels will follow in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T21:22:06.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
