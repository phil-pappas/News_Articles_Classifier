While most Aussies prefer to walk around fully clothed, there are a growing number of us who prefer to roam the earth as nature intended ... naked. \nHere are some of the best places in Australia for nudists (or naturists, as they prefer to be called) and for those who just don’t feel like covering themselves up. \n• Naked bushwalking in the Blue Mountains, NSW \nThe bush is probably not a place you would consider stripping off. The walks are guided by the Fat Canyoners Club , a group of mates who started the club because of a mutual enthusiasm for bushwalking, canyoning and all things outdoor-activity related. \nThe idea originally sparked from a discussion about one member’s passion for skinny-dipping, and quickly became a regular activity where people from all ages, shapes and sizes take part. Enjoying the view at Fortress Canyon, Blue Mountains. Source: Supplied \nDuring the walk, you have the opportunity to explore the park’s terrain and take a dip in the gorges and creeks. The group regularly end their tours with some yoga on the rocks, or even a canyoning adventure. They’ve also been known to surprise regular holiday-makers and campers who have just come for a regular, clothed experience. \nIt’s a liberating and educational experience. Be careful though, sunscreen won’t be the best protection against ‘friendly’ critters. \n• Nude retreat in the Whitsundays, QLD \nIf you don’t fancy the cooler weather when getting naked, why not try Queensland’s warmer climate? Seclude is a naturist retreat located in the Whitsunday Ranges between Proserpine and Airlie Beach. Hidden among 166 acres of rainforest, it’s the perfect location for being naked and undisturbed. \nYour own, self contained villa is equipped with free Wi-Fi, heated spa, quality kitchen facilities and airconditioning. Not to mention you are constantly surrounded by the rainforest rich in native flora and fauna. You’re also only a short bike ride away is Cedar Creek Falls, where you can explore the surroundings or take a skinny dip in the water. No need for clothes here. Cedar Creek Falls.

Source: Nikki Davis-Jones Source: News Corp Australia \nNot for the weak hearted, Dark Mofo ’s Winter solstice festival on the River Derwent sees hundreds of people standing on Sandy Bay beach on a crisp winter morning. Braving the 11 degree water temperatures, there’s a feeling of both nervousness and excitement. Many stay in the water only momentarily before opting for the warmth of their towels. \nIn its second year, the festival has brought wide media attention and naturists alike. \n• Bare all at Twisting Peacock Yoga, Perth WA \nIt’s not just east coaster’s who are passionate about nudity. Twisting Peacock Yoga studios in Perth have been at the forefront of the naked yoga trend. \nInstructors at the studio believe being naked should focus on self-liberation and allowing yourself to be comfortable with your unhidden exterior. The female-only class (sorry, boys), is a relaxed, easy to follow mix of Yin, Hatha and restorative yoga. Stripping back insecurities at naked yoga.

One of South Australia’s most spectacular beaches, the southern end is allocated for nudists only. Legalised in 1975, it became Australia’s first official nude beach. \nHeld in January every year, the games are an event for all ages; the day attracting people from both interstate and overseas. The competition looks tough. Source: News Limited \nThe most popular event though, is the ‘Best Bum’ competition where all kinds of derrières are judged based on firmness and shape. \nThe day is to promote naturism and raise awareness for nudists around Australia. With a BBQ and drinks available, the hosts also sell small money pouches — where else do you think you would keep your change? The Whitsunday Islands 26:05 \nWith its 74 islands and idyllic sailing conditions the Whitsundays are known as a 'sailing mecca' all over the world.
