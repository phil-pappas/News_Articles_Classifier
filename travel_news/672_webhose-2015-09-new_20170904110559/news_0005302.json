One with a pier where you can fish for a bit, then go up the road to take in some amazing cultural fare? And what if you could also ride on a bike path and see trees ablaze with color, then stop at a renowned museum to learn more about nature, the sky, the weather and more?\nWelcome to St. Johnsbury.\nSt. Johnsbury weaves a historic downtown, filled with interesting architecture and activities, with a rich landscape of forests, streams and all that nature offers. A regional hospital, the largest weekly farmers market in the area and striking art galleries enrich everyday life. All this happens in a community with more bridges than traffic lights and more spires than chain stores. Many consider it the perfect “hub” for a larger Vermont getaway.\nBut it’s worth a trip in itself.\nThe Fairbanks Museum (1302 Main St.), a classic “collectors museum,” is a must visit on a trip here. Also called a “cabinet of curiosity,” the museum is home to elements of flora and fauna and explanations to help visitors understand the region. It is also home to items gathered from all over the world by Victorian collector Franklin Fairbanks.\nThe building itself will give Boston-area folks a sense of home: The stone was quarried in Lynn.\nOutside, the builders played a fun game. Carvings of all kinds — faces of the famous and the not so famous, of animals and such cover the building. It is tradition to search them to find something cool, and it’s perfect for a mini scavenger hunt while there.\nThe building also houses a planetarium where you can study the stars, and the weather center is loved by weather buffs far and wide. You can get a feel for it all at www.fairbanksmuseum.org.\nTo delve more into the arts while in St. Johnsbury, check out the Catamount Arts Gallery and Catamount Film and Art Center (115 Eastern Ave.). With classes, film screenings and gallery showings, there’s always something going on. This fall, some special shows include “Amy Ragus: Fractured Visions I,” running until Friday with a closing reception that evening; and “Prilla Smith Brackett: Fractured Vision II,” running from Sept. 16 to Oct. 25, with an artist reception on Oct. 2 from 5-7 p.m. Learn more at www.catamountarts.org.\nThen there is the more kicked-back “art” of Vermont, which you can find anytime at the Kingdom Taproom (397 Railroad St.), a local favorite and a must for visitors. With plenty of locally crafted brew flowing, it’s the perfect place to sample and discover new favorites (the owners are well-versed about each brew). The food is wonderful, too. The Kingdom Taproom often hosts local charitable events, and is a great spot to meet locals. Learn more at www.kingdomtaproom.com.\nFor a shopping experience like nowhere else, spend time at the Moose River Lake and Lodge (370 Railroad St.). Notice I didn’t say stop in — you’ll want to poke around and enjoy the place for a good long time. Filled with moose and deer trophy mounts, bearskin rugs, antlers, hickory furniture and Pendleton blankets, you will find everything you need to outfit a rustic home. Comfy pillows and April Cornell linens will assure you that there is no need to rough it. Outfit yourself with styles from Ibex, Isis, Outback and Pendleton, and pick up a Vera Bradley bag for when you head into town. It even sells wine and staff members can educate you on the wines in stock. Check it all out at www.mooseriverlakeandlodgestore.com.\nAnd then there is, of course, nature itself. A well-maintained 15-mile-plus rail trail runs alongside town. That trail and the area around St. Johnsbury gives a special look at foliage time because of the area’s various tree species and their unique colors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T20:56:58.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
