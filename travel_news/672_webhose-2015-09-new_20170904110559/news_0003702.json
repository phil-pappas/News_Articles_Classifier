Legend says that a local abbot brought soil from the Holy Land to Sedlec and tossed it into the air over the original medieval cemetery. When news spread of his actions, the cemetery became the most popular burial spot around. During the 15th century, a new church was slated to be built, and the bones were unearthed and put into a depository owned by a monastery. All eventualy reverted to the ownership of a wealthy family who paid to have the chapel decorated with 40,000+ medieval skeletons. \nExamination of some of the bones on display reveals evidence of battle wounds – particularly skull fractures - incurred by those who died at war. These imperfect bones were not incorporated into Sedlec Ossuary's decorations, but instead are presented as a sort of archeological exhibit. \nVisitors to Sedlec Ossuary can read information about the history of the ossuary in their language of choice. Photos are permitted – these will impress your friends back home, if nothing else.
