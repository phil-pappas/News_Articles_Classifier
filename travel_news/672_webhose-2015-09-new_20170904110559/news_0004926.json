Three champagnes were specially selected for this event: Ruinart Blanc de Blancs, Veuve Clicquot Rose, and Dom Perignon, Vintage 2004. Guests and team members gathered around the Viejas Hotel pool at 8:00 pm and received tasting notes and historical perspective from Mr. Hoagland, while enjoying samples of each champagne. Breaking this world record was the crowning event in an evening filled with entertainment for Viejas guests. \nChris Kelley, General Manager of Viejas, remarked on the occasion, “This anniversary celebration highlights our commitment to deliver the best experience possible for our guests through a team that is capable of rewriting the record books.” \nViejas began in 1991 as a stand-alone bingo parlor and has since grown into a AAA Four Diamond resort.
