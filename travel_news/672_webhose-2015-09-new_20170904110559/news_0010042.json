Automated enforcement is one of the tools we have at our disposal.\"Automated speed enforcement is gradually becoming more common around the country but remains relatively rare, with only 138 jurisdictions operating such programs as of last month. If all U.S. communities had speed-camera programs like the one IIHS studied in Maryland's Montgomery County , more than 21,000 fatal or incapacitating injuries would have been prevented in 2013. Speed cameras were introduced in Montgomery County in 2007. As of 2014, the county had 56 fixed cameras, 30 portable cameras and 6 mobile speed vans. The cameras are used on residential streets with speed limits of 35 mph or less and in school zones. IIHS originally looked at the Montgomery County program during its first year. Six months into the program, the proportion of drivers traveling at least 10 miles over the speed limit had fallen on streets with cameras. Seven years later, the program is still working. Cameras have reduced by 59 percent the likelihood of a driver exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph, compared with similar roads in two nearby Virginia counties that don't have speed cameras, the latest study found. The researchers also looked at crashes on camera-eligible roads in Montgomery County , relative to comparison roads in Virginia . They found that the camera program resulted in a 19 percent reduction in the likelihood that a crash would involve a fatality or an incapacitating injury, as reported by a police officer on the scene. \"Speed cameras get drivers to ease off the accelerator, and crashes are less likely to be deadly at lower speeds,\" Lund says. \"This study connects the dots to show that speed cameras save lives.\" 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T07:32:15.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
