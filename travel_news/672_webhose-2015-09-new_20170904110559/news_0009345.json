Comment Posted Sep. 3, 2015 at 3:00 PM Posted Sep. 3, 2015 at 3:00 PM Colonel J. Bret Johnson, superintendent of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, reminds Missouri’s travelers to make safety part of their Labor Day weekend. Johnson strongly urges the use of seat belts when traveling in any kind of vehicle and life jackets when on a Missouri lake, river or stream. In 2014, six people were killed and 369 injured in Missouri over the Labor Day holiday in 901 traffic crashes. Of that total, troopers worked 274 traffic crashes, which included 120 injuries and three of the fatalities over the 2014 Labor Day holiday. Troopers arrested 94 people for driving while intoxicated during last year’s holiday weekend. The 2015 counting period for the Labor Day holiday will be from 6 p.m., Friday, September 4, through 11:59 p.m., Monday, September 7. MSHP will be participating in Operation C.A.R.E. (Combined Accident Reduction Effort) over the Labor Day holiday weekend. All available officers will be patrolling Missouri’s roadways enforcing Missouri’s speed limit, seat belt and alcohol laws, in addition to being available to assist motorists. Troopers throughout the state will participate in a special enforcement operation on September 4 and again on September 7. This operation will include Interstates 29, 44, 55 and 70, and U.S. Highways 60 and 61. Troopers will be targeting all traffic violations and will be especially vigilant of aggressive driving violations. Johnson reminds the public that the Labor Day holiday is a busy boating weekend, as well. In 2014, there were 13 boating crashes with five injuries and zero fatalities. There were no drownings. Troopers arrested 14 people for boating while intoxicated during last year's counting period. In an effort to increase safety on our state’s waters, all available officers will be working over the holiday weekend. Missouri’s boaters are asked to do their part by remaining alert for other boats and swimmers, and being courteous on the water. With more boats on the water, it is even more important to pay attention when operating a vessel. To report a crash or other emergency, call the patrol’s Emergency Report Line at 1 (800) 525-5555 or *55 on a cellular phone.
