Thome, Ph.D., eTN Africa Correspondent | Sep 16, 2015 eTN   \nThe newly-reconstructed main Rwanda to Uganda road link from Kigali to the border in Gatuna – the nearest Ugandan town then is Kabale – has been officially opened to traffic yesterday. Built over the past three-and-a-half years at a cost of nearly 63 million euros, the project was substantially funded by the European Union to help boost the northern traffic corridor from the port of Mombasa to the hinterland countries of Uganda, Rwanda, and Eastern Congo. The EU reportedly availed some 57 million euros in bilateral aid towards the construction while the Rwandan government injected the equivalent of over 5 million euros in local currency, the Rwanda franc. \nThe newly-upgraded section is some 78 kilometers long and thought to be a critical factor for improved road connectivity between Rwanda and Uganda. \nA second axis is being constructed to and from the Ugandan border post of Mirama Hill, where only recently a one stop center, housing both Ugandan and Rwandan customs, immigration, and security officials, has been inaugurated. \nThe reconstructed road link is of importance to the two countries’ trade but also the important tourism sectors as road transport from the tourism hub of Kabala will now more easily transit into Rwanda. However, the border crossing from Kisoro to Cyanika and on to Musanze appears to be equally if not more popular with tourists who have gone for hikes and gorilla tracking on the Nkuringo side of Bwindi National Park.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T08:01:08.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
