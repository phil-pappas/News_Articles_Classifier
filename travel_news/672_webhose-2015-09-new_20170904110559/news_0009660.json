The expansion includes a 200-guest room resort that also features a spa, meeting and convention space, and pool area. The 342,000-square-foot addition will expand the amenities at the existing $800 million casino and entertainment facility that opened in November 2013, with a full array of gaming, dining and entertainment. \nLocated just off U.S. Highway 101 at Golf Course Drive West in Rohnert Park, Calif., the Graton Resort & Casino is owned by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria and is managed by Station Casinos LLC. \nThe six-story hotel will seamlessly connect to the south side of the existing facility near Daily Grill and M.Y. Noodles restaurants. The hotel will feature a variety of guest rooms and suites, from a typical guest room of more than 500 square feet to suites of up to 2,600 square feet. It will also feature an opulent lobby and bar, a luxurious spa, and 20,000 square feet of flexible event and convention space that includes seven separate rooms, as well as pre-function areas and smaller breakout meeting rooms. The centerpiece of the resort will be a pool area that will serve as an extension of the hotel lobby, and will provide an outdoor connection to the convention and meeting space. \nConstruction will commence following the groundbreaking ceremony and the resort is anticipated to open in the fall 2016. The expansion will create more than 1,000 construction jobs throughout the various stages of development, and will utilize nearly 100 California-based companies. The resort expansion was designed by Friedmutter Group, and PENTA Building Group will serve as the general contractor. \nThe resort and all of its new offerings will join the existing array of more than 130 popular table games; 3,000 slot and video poker games; live poker; an 8,700-square-foot events center for concerts and special events; and a dozen restaurants and bars, including Tony’s of North Beach operated by 11-time World Pizza Champion Tony Gemignani, M.Y. Noodles by renowned Chef Martin Yan, 630 Park Steakhouse and Daily Grill, as well as a variety of casual dining choices inside the 500-seat Marketplace.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T22:55:13.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
