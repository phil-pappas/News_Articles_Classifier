My wife and I will be with my parents in Haridwar for our annual visit in late Dec / early Jan. Since we have a little more time this time around, we'd like to go into the mountains for a 5 to 7 day trip. So, I need ideas and advice... What are some of the places one might visit this time of the year? Interested in going deeper into the Himalayas, not the hill stations. Been to Uttarkashi, Harshil, Gwaldham, Binsar, Ranikhet, Nainital already... Hiking possibilities in/around the area are important to us. Last time, we did Dodital and Darwa pass. So, if there are day hikes or winter treks we can do nearby, that'd be ideal. What's the road situation in Uttarakhand these days? One of the decisions we'd need to make is whether to take my parents' car (Maruti Swift) with a driver or to rent something else. I apologize that this is somewhat open ended request but am bit short of ideas. I have read some of the threads. Munsiary cames to mind and is perhaps at the top of my list right now. But, I read that people who tried to trek out in winter did not get very far. I also read Almoraboy's Har ki Doon trek report with interest. Don't know how things are these days. If anyone has information or advice on suitability of doing this in late December, that would be very useful as this is a possibility I am considering. Would appreciate any thoughts you might be willing to share. Are generally familiar with the surroundings, cold, winter hiking challenges. However, we are not as familiar with the devastation caused by rains and flooding over the recent years. Can also go to Himachal where we have not been but generally prefer less time driving in the plains and more into the mountains...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T04:25:00.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
