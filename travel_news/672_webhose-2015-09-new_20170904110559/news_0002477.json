He and the other guests were told to keep still and ignore the elephant, who was casually meandering in the background. \nIn the video, Montauge is visibly anxious as he nervously taps his finger on the table. His curiosity eventually gets the best of him, and he looks over and straight into the eyes of the wild animal. \nThat’s when things hit the fan. \nThe elephant flaps its ears, takes three steps forward, cocks its head to the side, and slams into Montague with its trunk. His long tusks narrowly miss Montague, who goes flying out of the frame. \nRelated: Surprise! Cheetah Jumps Into Jeep During African Safari \nThe elephant then takes out his frustrations on Montagues friend, Shane Wolf, who is struck by the forceful trunk and thrown into the dinner table. \nDishes crash to the ground, and guests scatter as the agitated elephant loses interest and strolls off into the African sunset. \nGuess he wasn’t a fan of the menu. \nWATCH: Spend the Best Day of Your Life in an Elephant Retirement Home \nLet Yahoo Travel inspire you every day.
