In the past, it had estimated there were around 160,000 visitors to the park annually. Marion van Dijk \nTrampers walk along Anapai Beach in the Abel Tasman National Park. \n\"The real challenge for us is to measure the day visitors that enter the park,\" said Townsend. \"To try and estimate those numbers we draw on our concession operators, that's a big chunk of our visitors coming in by water taxi. They hop on at Marahau or Kaiteriteri and travel around by foot or kayak.\" \nThe department estimates around 75 per cent of those visiting the Abel Tasman are day visitors. \n\"It is the first year we have broken that million dollar milestone,\" Townsend said. \"It has been steadily increasing and because of the good summer we had it has jumped up.\" Last year, there were over 75,000 individual bednights at Abel Tasman huts and campsites, excluding the Totaranui campsite. A new 34-bed hut was built at Anchorage 18 months ago and was fully booked for the month of January and at full capacity for more than a third of the year. Despite the perception that the Abel Tasman is targeted mainly at overseas visitors, 40 per cent of those who stay overnight in the park are Kiwis. After New Zealanders, Germans were the next most frequent overnight visitors, followed by American then French visitors. \nA breakdown of visitors to the Abel Tasman National Park between July 2014 and June 2015. \nWilsons Abel Tasman chief executive Darryl Wilson said having access to visitor statistics was a positive step in the transparency between DOC and tourism operators in the park. \n\"I have been lobbying for this to be available in a useable format for operators to understand what is happening,\" said Wilson. \"It is really important as a tourism industry we understand the figures and know where people are coming from.\" \nHe said DOC had developed a stronger commercial focus and they had been more actively promoting the Great Walks, targeting overseas visitors in particular. \"Looking at the standard of accommodation that is starting to appear, it is a very cost effective holiday in some of New Zealand's best environments,\" said Wilson. As a result it was no surprise the park was becoming increasingly popular and he questioned whether taxpayers were subsidising accommodation for international visitors. He said the recent statistics raised an opportunity to discuss other payment options for international visitors, such as concession fees. Most places in the world charged a premium for access to national parks and visitors to New Zealand often expected the same would apply here, said Wilson. Marahau Sea Kayaks and Abel Tasman Aqua Taxi commercial director Brendan Alborn said he had noticed growth in visitors over the last two years and said it was a result of good weather and increased international arrivals.
