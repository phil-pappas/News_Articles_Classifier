As a result, the new consultation makes detailed proposals on changes to the rules and regulations for pilot licensing, operations and airworthiness with a view to deregulating or delegating where possible in order to simplify compliance for GA pilots and organisations.\nAn impact assessment on these proposals has been completed that indicates a substantial saving to the GA community.\nAll the proposals follow our principles already adopted for the oversight of GA, which include:\n• only regulate when necessary, and do so proportionately\n• deregulate where possible\n• delegate where appropriate\n• not to gold-plate, and quickly and efficiently remove gold-plating that already exists\n• help create a vibrant and dynamic GA sector in the UK.\nAll the proposed changes have been influenced by an independent GA challenge panel chaired by Julian Scarfe, Vice President of Europe Air Sports, which was put in place to provide challenge and act as a critical friend to the process.\nThe current consultation is available at www.caa.co.uk/consultations and will close on 4 November 2015. A new ANO is expected to be enacted in autumn 2016 to closely align with the arrival of European Aviation Safety Agency operational rules for private aircraft.\nWhere possible changes will be introduced prior to the new ANO by exemptions to bring the benefits to the GA community as soon as possible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T03:23:47.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
