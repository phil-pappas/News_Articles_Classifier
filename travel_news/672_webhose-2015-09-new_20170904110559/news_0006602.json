It fosters discipline, camaraderie and morals, and beefed-up athleticism doesn’t come into it at a young age. Figures released in July showed record numbers of children are playing the sport. World Rugby’s Get Into Rugby initiative drew 460,000 youngsters worldwide last year – a figure that is predicted to rise to 600,000 in 2015. “Life is about taking knocks, getting back off the floor and going again,” the former England centre says. “I am not immune to the worries of a parent – that my boy Archie might pick up an injury through rugby – but it is what a sport gives you, the feeling of being together as one and of building something. To me that is far more important.” Jonny Wilkinson, Greenwood’s match-winning team-mate in that Sydney final 12 years ago, has spoken of what rugby has given him.
