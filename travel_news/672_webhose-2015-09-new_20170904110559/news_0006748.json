The Crowne Plaza properties, managed by Redefine|BDL Hotels – the UK’s leading independent hotel management company – have created special spaces within the hotels aimed at helping guests get the most out of conferences and training events. \nThe rooms have been kitted out in accordance with a 22-point checklist to make them brain friendly zones. Measures include ionisers to ensure the air is in tip top condition for guests, specially selected ‘brain boosting’ snacks, and calming furnishings and décor – including plants which neutralise electromagnetic fields. Access to outdoor open spaces and moveable furniture are also on the agenda to help create a productive environment rather than the traditional ‘talk and chalk’ corporate sessions. Guests arriving at these venues will also have access to a ‘Stress Free Essentials’ box containing commonly forgotten items including a portable phone charger, emergency ties, tights and hand sanitiser. An ‘Eat Well, Work Well’ menu is also available at the hotels, offering guests food to provide all the energy and nutrients they need to stay focused, creative and full of ideas all day long. Joanne Taylor-Stagg, Divisional Director at Redefine|BDL Hotels, said: “Our hotels pride themselves on offering the very best experience to guests using their conference and meeting facilities. “Making these venues ‘brain friendly’ will serve to enhance the great service they already provide and help guests to get the most out of their meetings, conferences and training events.” Crowne Plaza Birmingham NEC, Crowne Plaza London – Docklands, Crowne Plaza London – Heathrow, Crowne Plaza Manchester Airport, Crowne Plaza Marlow, and Crowne Plaza Reading are all participating in the scheme. The Brain Friendly Venues scheme builds on Crowne Plaza’s effective Meeting Success Programme, which offers outstanding facilities and meticulous attention to detail to ensure that meetings and events are a success.
