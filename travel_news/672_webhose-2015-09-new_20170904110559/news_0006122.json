There is air, water and land, and even in these areas, one has multiple options to choose from. The choice of transport also depends on ones differing preferences and needs, as in if one is traveling to a far away place then the most opted for choices are by plane or by train. Whereas if one is traveling to a short distance or even one take could take a day at the most, then road or bus are more preferred. Also, many times people like to think of their budget, how much are they willing to spend, whether they even want to spend a lot of not, and how much time will each transport take. Selecting a transport mode is never easy these days since there are so many. Noted traveler Andy Hayes understands, that while one might look better and more comfortable, people go for the more feasible option. Many times, people deliberately take a longer route while traveling, as in, if they are traveling cross country, sometimes they might not take a usual plane and could just go for a bus changing every way and make a trip out of it, or get a car and make a road trip out of it. Andy Hayes, Oregon himself has taken many road trips to understand the thrill of it. But, while selecting the perfect mode of transport can be difficult here are a few tips one can use to decide on one: 1. Time to Reach Destination: One should decide on a transport mode based on how soon they have to reach their destination. In case of a business meeting or a conference or a seminar even, one should take the fastest route available to reach there. If one is going on a leisure vacation, then they can take whichever route they like, the fastest or the more scenic one and lengthen their vacation. 2. Budget: Andy Hayes, Oregon State Treasury, understands that not everyone has the funds to travel a first class in the plane or get a luxurious seat in a bus or train. That is why, the budget for traveling must be kept in mind when deciding. Sometimes taking a train and bus might be more pocket friendly than the expensive tickets of a plane. But if one is enrolled with flier miles and such schemes then one can get a discount on their ticket too. 3. Any Sickness or anything:Many people are prone to get sea sick, or road sick or air sick. And thus they should avoid such modes of transports. So, take a quick check of whether any mode of trans[port makes one nauseated or not and then choose.
