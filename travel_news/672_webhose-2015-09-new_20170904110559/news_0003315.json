Many details have already leaked about the devices and ultimately, more will be revealed at the event as usual. However, depending on which iPhone you currently have, there are already many reasons why you should consider an upgrade. Your current model - iPhone 5 or below. Notice that I've excluded the iPhone 5S here - we'll get to that in a minute. The simple answer here is yes and I can vouch from personal experience here as I made the move from the iPhone 5 to the iPhone 6 myself. Bigger screen [caption id=\"attachment_2350\" align=\"\" width=\"1920\"] iPhone 6 vs iPhone 5 side by side - Image Credit: Antony Leather[/caption]The larger screen (4inches for the iPhone 5 to 4.7inches for the iPhone 6) makes the whole experience a much easier and more productive one, despite the fact that one-handed use is now a bit sketchy, even with Reachability - Apple's attempt at appeasing fans of its smaller phones by allowing you to double tap lightly on the home button to bring the app down the screen to your thumb. The keyboard is easier to use, watching videos is more enjoyable as are playing games.With a beefed-up camera that's capable of taking better photos and videos, there are plenty of other reasons to have a larger more vivid and higher resolution screen too - we're doing more things on our smartphones, not less after all. However, there's still no smaller iPhone in sight so if you're desperate for an upgrade, the iPhone 6S is it. For now at least. Higher resolution display [caption id=\"attachment_3856\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] The Galaxy S6 Edge has a much higher resolution screen than the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus[/caption]Just before the launch of the new iPhones, a leak points to them sporting significantly higher resolutions than their predecessors. The iPhone 6S especially could offer a resolution of 2,000 x 1,125 pixels, equating to a DPI of 466 - that's 50% more pixels in the same space as the iPhone 6. This is a huge upgrade, if it proves to be true of course. It's not quite as lavish as Apple's competitors - the Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge has a DPI of 577 and at extreme end of the spectrum you have Sony's Xperia Z5 Premium with a slightly crazy 4K display and DPI of 806. However, the resolution was perhaps once of the most disappointing features when the new, larger iPhones were announced last year and as the competition has made further gains since, this is could be a good move by Apple. Better battery life [caption id=\"attachment_2373\" align=\"\" width=\"1920\"] Thanks to a larger chassis, the iPhone 6 offered a much larger battery than the iPhone 5S seen here side by side - Image Credit: Antony Leather[/caption]The iPhone 6 had better battery life than the iPhone 5S and there's another important issue to take into account here too - battery degradation. Over time, all lithium ion batteries gradually degrade and if you've been charging your iPhone every day since you bought it, chances are your iPhone 4 or iPhone 5 won't last nearly as long now as the day you bought it. iOS 8 and iOS 9 support iOS 8 support was a slight issue for Apple. Many compatible devices didn't have enough space to house the new OS, while the iPhone 4 and below couldn't even upgrade - I still see plenty of iPhone 4's around too. The new iPhone 6S will not only support iOS 9 when it arrives (and plenty more revisions after that), but with the rumoured inclusion of an enhanced version of Force Touch - probably to be called 3D Touch Display, which could support three distinct touch types, the iPhone 6S could offer a huge improvement in hour you use iOS and its apps, even compared to the iPhone 6. Better camera [caption id=\"attachment_2479\" align=\"\" width=\"1920\"] The iPhone 6's camera was a vast improvement on previous models - could the iPhone 6S wow us again? Image Credit: Antony Leather[/caption]The iPhone 6S and 6S Plus continue the bolstering of specifications against the competition with a rumoured 12MP camera, up 4MP compared to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus as well as the ability to shoot video in 4K. The iPhone 6's camera was a big step up from the iPhone 5S too, so older models will see a significant upgrade in image quality - great if you use your iPhone as your primary camera and enjoy photography. Faster hardware [caption id=\"attachment_2370\" align=\"\" width=\"1920\"] the iPhone 6S will likely bee much faster than previous iPhones - Image Credit: Antony Leather[/caption]One of the best reasons you should consider upgrading is a faster specification. The new iPhone's will be much more capable at handling iOS 8 and the forthcoming iOS 9 than say the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5. Memory will likely stand at 2GB with a faster processor too, meaning the OS will be faster and games will run more smoothly. Touch ID One of the simplest yet most useful features to be introduced with the iPhone 5S was TouchID and with the iPhone 6-series, it's also ushered in support for Apple Pay. Not only is TouchID a hugely convenient and quick way of unlocking your device (this looks set to be even better on the new iPhones too), but it allows for one-touch purchases while Apple Pay support is growing rapidly with a wide adoption rate in the US and UK. Your current model - iPhone 5S The venerable iPhone 5S is still able to hold its own in many ways, but many of the reasons above also apply. The iPhone 6S will offer a massive upgrade both in terms of screen size, battery life, speed, camera quality and if the rumours are true - screen resolution too.The iPhone 5S does sport Touch ID, but is unable to take advantage of Apply Pay as it lacks an NFC chip so if you're prepared to make the move to a larger smartphone, the iPhone 6S could still make for a compelling upgrade. Your current model - iPhone 6 Despite owning an iPhone 6 myself, there are plenty of reasons to consider an upgrade depending on what turns out to be true amongst the every longer list of rumours. Firstly, there's the screen resolution. I reported here about the exciting prospect of a massive boost to the 4.7inch iPhone's screen pixel density and if this finds its way onto the specs list, I'll certainly be drooling over it. A 3D Touch Display could also offer hardcore iPhone 6 users a compelling reason to upgrade, although I'd want to see just how this is incorporated into iOS, especially iOS 9 first. While we're on the subject of touch, TouchID looks set to get faster and more accurate too. In all honesty, I've had no problems with my iPhone 6 hear. It's fast, responsive and it's only if my finger is a little dirty or wet that I have issues. The camera is another area that might make iPhone 6 users a little grumpy - the move from 8MP to 12MP and the offer of 4K video recording are going to be highly desirable if the iPhone 6 is your primary camera and you use it a lot. Of course, megapixels aren't everything in the world of photography, so until there are some iPhone 6 vs iPhone 6S comparison shots in the wild, we'll have to reserve judgement here.
