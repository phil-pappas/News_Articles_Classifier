Together, ALHI now represents 23 luxurious Norwegian Cruise Line cruise ships appropriate for a variety of meeting & incentive (M&I) programs. Able to accommodate groups from ports nearly anywhere around the world, the 14 new additions are Norwegian Freestyle Cruising ships, which provide to groups and guests the opportunity to enjoy a relaxed, resort-style cruise experience on the youngest and most contemporary ships at sea. These cruise ships complement four luxury-level Regent Seven Seas cruise ships and five upper-premium Oceania Cruise Line ships, which joined ALHI’s portfolio in 2013, and which also have highly respected Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) as their parent company. The announcement was made by ALHI President Jim Schultenover.\n“We are very proud to expand our relationship with Norwegian Cruise Line with the addition of these 14 incredible cruise ships for our Accounts to choose among our worldwide portfolio, and to our ‘ALHI Ocean Line’ luxury brand segment,” said Schultenover. “We’ve added these cruise ships to address the growing demand by the Accounts we serve; to provide yet greater global and itinerary options to accommodate planners’ inquiries and needs; to add more ports of calls and the flexibility of additional 3-7 night sailings; and to add even more variety and options to our ‘Ocean Line’ portfolio. Luxury cruise ships have become very popular with groups for both incentive programs and meetings. We want to be able to serve our Accounts as they explore the best options for their objectives and strategies. In addition to the ability to travel by sea to amazing destinations around the world, you have the added benefit of all-inclusive pricing, which is very appealing for budgeting purposes and which also can provide an incredible and memorable experience.”\n“The 23 premier cruise ships in ALHI’s portfolio are essentially like Four- and Five-Star quality floating resorts,” said Schultenover. “Sailing from many of the most appealing ports and destinations around the world, the Norwegian collection of cruise ships provide very attentive and proactive Four- and Five-Star quality levels of personalized service, outstanding cuisine, truly luxurious state-of-the-art facilities, inviting and unique meeting and event spaces, a wide range of outstanding recreation and entertainment options on board, and imaginative and exciting itineraries.”\n“These exceptional cruise ships are a very appealing and unique way for organizations and companies to recognize their best employees, valued members and customers, and as a very special way to celebrate a milestone anniversary or extraordinary achievement,” added Schultenover. “Guests can experience multiple destinations and countries, and only have to unpack once. Plus, the ships provide excellent networking opportunities. Add to that the high-quality consistency of the entire fleet of Norwegian Cruise Line’s ships, and that there are so many options that can provide a big ‘Wow’ for a meeting or incentive group, which ensures a truly memorable experience for the program attendees. Some of our Accounts choose to do a full buyout with a custom voyage itinerary specifically created for their group’s needs and objectives. By ALHI having the variety of sizes of ships from small to larger, it provides an opportunity that we enjoy to discuss with clients interested in exploring a cruise option for their organization.”\nNorwegian Cruise Line, recently named “Europe’s Leading Cruise Line” for the seventh consecutive year and the “Caribbean’s Leading Cruise Line” for the second time, is recognized as the innovator in cruise travel.
