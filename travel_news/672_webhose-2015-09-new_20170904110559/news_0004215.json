Scheduled to open in 2018, the project provides the Group with a unique opportunity to further extend its reach in the important Middle East market. \nThe overall development comprises two adjacent buildings located in Beirut’s Central District at the heart of Lebanon’s capital. Mandarin Oriental, Beirut will be situated in the south tower, with 280 well-appointed rooms and suites and 25 serviced apartments. All will be designed in a contemporary style, with exacting attention to detail that is reflective of the Group’s oriental heritage. The north tower will house 103 Residences at Mandarin Oriental, that will provide the most luxurious and desirable living in central Beirut. \nThe architects of the development are the renowned Singapore-based designers, Kerry Hill, and the design will reflect a bold and elegant style that cleverly integrates the different project components of the hotel and the residences. Featuring local sandstone with shaded private outdoor spaces and colonnades, as well as extensive rooftop terraces, the entire project will reflect a sense of sophisticated, urban resort living. \nMandarin Oriental, Beirut will offer some of the finest dining in the region, with an all-day dining restaurant and bar, a chic lobby lounge and a spacious club lounge spread across the lower levels of the two towers. In addition a fine dining restaurant and bar will span across the top of both towers affording spectacular views over the cityscape. Extensive banqueting and meeting space will include a 300-seat grand ballroom, a 270-seat junior ballroom and a variety of adaptable conference rooms. \nIn keeping with the Group’s award-winning spa concepts, a spacious Spa at Mandarin Oriental will offer holistic rejuvenation and relaxation, together with a state-of-the art fitness centre and indoor pool. An additional outdoor pool will be situated at the top of the building providing guests with outstanding views. \nThe project is under development by the Olayan Group, a Saudi Arabian multi-national group, with whom Mandarin Oriental recently jointly acquired The Hotel Ritz, Madrid. \n“We are delighted to be opening a new luxury hotel in the important, historic city of Beirut and look forward to bringing Mandarin Oriental’s renowned levels of hospitality to this exciting project.
