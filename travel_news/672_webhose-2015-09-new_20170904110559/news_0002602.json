When Kumbh Mela was being celebrated just 4-hours road drive away from Mumbai, I simply packed my rugsack and headed out to experience this globally renowned human gathering. It's true! You can feel the vibe in this town where saffron tilaks and dreadlocks are a common sight. As you walk along, get ready to be transported into the era of Lord Rama in exile where story-tellers point at depressions in stone and narrate tales of 'Mata Sita'. Just then, spot a group of Sadhus as they wave back at curious onlookers while some may say a robust 'no' for photographs. There's never a dull moment, really.\nIt's all in the stars: \n- This destination is a leveller of sorts where the rich and the common man walk miles to take a dip in the same Ghat to offer prayers. Astronomically, the Nashik Kumbh Mela is celebrated when Jupiter and the Sun falls on the zodiac sign Leo. Mythologically, it dates back to the time of 'Samudra Manthan' when the Gods and the demons fought over a pot of nectar and Lord Vishnu flew away with it spilling some drops at four different spots â€” Nashik, Ujjain, Haridwar and Prayag. This time around, Nashik plays host to the Kumbh after 12 years. At the Ram Ghat, there is a small temple, which opens once in 12 years. The Kumbh Mela will conclude on Sept 25, 2015.\nThrow caution to the wind: \n- The Maharashtra Government has organised the entire congregation with a secured plan in place. Once here, you can hear loudspeakers blaring messages of cleanliness and personal security. The local police shall ably guide you right from the entry point to the parking area and then ahead toward the ghats. A photographer's delight, just pause for a moment and take to the sights of Tapovan and Panchavati. The blissful feeling is for all to share and that's the gift bestowed at Kumbh.\n\n\n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:50:40.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
