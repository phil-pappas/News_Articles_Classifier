But be sure to also experience its other side â€” modern museums, food markets, interesting neighbourhoods and urban regeneration projects and plush hotels. For a great panoramic view of the city head to the Mount of Olives and have a glimpse of this photogenic city, built entirely out of different shades of native stone juxtaposed against bursts of bougainvillea and honeysuckle.\n\nMake an excursion to the Mahane Yehuda Market or the Shuk to get a whiff of local life. This historic food market lined with stalls selling sweet smelling halwa, marzipan, goat's cheese, and piles of freshly baked bread, fruits and vegetables, dates back to 1928. The liveliest days are Thursday and Friday when Jews shop for the Sabbath. Start with a cappuccino at Cafe Mizrachi or a fresh orange juice. When in the Old City, head to the Austrian Hospice for a quiet coffee and sacher torte as well as a unparalleled view of the city from its the roof.\n\nFor retail therapy head to a buzzing Ben-Yehuda Street at Zion Square, which offers the city's best shopping, souvenir shops sports bars, and cafes. Don't miss a trip to the German Colony which was settled in the 1870's, who belonged to the Christian Zionist movement. It is one of the most charming areas in Jerusalem and is known for its 19th century stone houses with a blend of Ottoman and British Art Deco architecture as well as for its cafe culture. Have a meal at Colony restaurant built inside an old industrial hanger sampling freshly baked breads with various dips, herby salads and meat dishes.\n\nA unique new attraction is the recently restored Ottoman era station building which has a vast wooden deck for strolling and entertainment filled with restaurants, cafes and ice cream parlours as well as a farmer's market once week. For a heart wrenching experience, visit the Yad Vashem with a Holocaust History Museum that showcases testimonies, letters and photographs of victims and survivors of the Holocaust. And finally end your stay here with a touch of magic, see the famous Dead Sea scrolls, the oldest Biblical manuscripts in the world recovered from a cave in Qumran, and exhibited in a special temperature and humidity controlled room at the Israel Museum.\n(The author is a Chennai-based writer) \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:50:42.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
