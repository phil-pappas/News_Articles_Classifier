An ultimate Disney holiday combines the iconic theme parks with cruising. It doesn’t matter how old your children are, there are attractions and activities tailored to different ages, from toddlers to teenagers, and even that awkward “tween” age group. Sharing adventures together is all part of the excitement on a Disney holiday. There is no shortage of entertainment for kids of all ages on land or at sea At Epcot, explore the incredible history of our planet at the IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth show. From its fiery beginnings to great hopes for the future, the fireworks show will have visitors of every age transfixed. Or discover amazing wildlife as you spot lions and elephants on a safari ride at nearby Animal Kingdom. The fun for families continues on board Disney cruise ships, where spectacular West End-style musicals delight all ages. From Disney’s Believe, a musical extravaganza starring 20 favourite characters currently on board Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy, to Tangled: The Musical coming in November 2015 on Disney Magic and Toy Story – The Musical currently on Disney Wonder. Don’t miss the amazing Pirates in the Caribbean deck party, where crew and characters dress up in their finest nautical attire and Mickey Mouse and his friends have to fend off an attack from Captain Hook and Mr Smee, ending with a triumphant and magical fireworks display – the first of its kind at sea. Children can also join the themed clubs on board, which offer world-class interactive programmes that will keep your little ones engaged and entertained every step of the way. The children may be off having fun for hours with a whole range of different activities on offer. At the Oceaneer’s Club, a themed activity centre for children aged between three and 12 years old, they can listen to stories or make up games in imaginatively themed rooms designed to resemble Disney films such as Toy Story. Keeping kids busy: it doesn't matter how old your children are, there are attractions and activities tailored to all ages Wannabe Agents of SHIELD can join the Marvel Avengers Academy on board the Disney Magic and undergo training, plus they can even meet Captain America, while Pixie Hollow is the perfect magical retreat for discovering fairies. Later this year Star Wars goes to sea on board Disney Dream, with a special Millennium Falcon play area for young Jedi hopefuls. The very young have their own play areas on board too. For a small additional charge, supervised nurseries are available for the under-threes with interactive games, fun-coloured play areas and a “quiet zone” for naps to give mum and dad a day or evening off – they’re open until 11pm. Little ones can scream and giggle on their own Magic Kingdom attractions such as the Mad Hatter’s giant teacups. They will love meeting their favourite turtle for a real-time question and answer session at Epcot. Join Turtle Talk with Crush from Finding Nemo and watch their faces light up as they get to ask the righteous little dude whatever is on their minds. More friends await at the Animation Courtyard in Hollywood Studios where Disney Junior stars Jake and Sofia are on hand for pictures and autographs. And don’t miss the Magic Kingdom Festival of Fantasy Parade, filled with music, dancing, colourful floats and all your favourite Disney characters. Teenagers can be notoriously tricky to amuse on holiday. But even the tetchiest of teens will succumb to the thrills of the Magic Kingdom’s classic rides in Walt Disney World, such as Space Mountain with its rocket-ride through space and realistic gravity force-field. Wet and wild: take the plunge on the water slides at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon The Rock ’n’ Roller Coaster at Hollywood Studios is a speeding stretch-limo ride along the freeways of LA on the way to an Aerosmith concert. At Hollywood Studios, for example, they can take a 3-D simulated space flight into Star Wars territory or jump on Expedition Everest and race through the Himalayas on a speeding train – keep an eye out for yetis – at Animal Kingdom. And if they want to show off to their new friends – and which teenager doesn’t? – they can race each other down the Toboggan Racers slides at Typhoon Lagoon. Teenagers can enjoy their own space with tailored activities at Vibe on board the Disney cruise ships. This exclusive club has a cool lounge where they can chill out to music, enjoy smoothies, watch their favourite TV or play video games. They can cool off in one of the outdoor whirlpool spas and even catch some rays on their own adult-free sundeck too. Not to be outdone, “tweens” (11-14-year-olds) have their own exclusive cruise club. Edge has a loft-style lounge with vast video wall, a dance floor, as well as daily activities such as ghost-hunting games or stand-up comedian workshops. One thing is for sure, there is no shortage of entertainment for kids of all ages on land or at sea. • Find out more about Disney Cruises, Disney holidays and Walt Disney World", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:24:15.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
