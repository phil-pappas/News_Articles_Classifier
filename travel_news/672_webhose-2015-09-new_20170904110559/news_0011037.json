Lose the runway\" designers are hoping the TriFan 600 would remove the need for long runways and \"airport-to-airport\" travel, instead travellers could be dropped door-to-door, making the aircraft the perfect form of transport for personal and business use. \nBut despite the compact size of the inner-workings of the TriFan600, the designers will not be skimping on comfort. \nThe \"unparalleled cabin space\" can also be configured to offer a \"medical evacuation or air ambulatory configuration\" or a cabin that offers luxury travel. \nThe TriFan 600 is one of several plan aircraft designs in the works that are hoping to transform the way we travel. \nEarlier in 2015, KLM proposed their AHEAD (Advanced Hybrid Engine Aircraft Development aircraft) which would feature a blended wing that would minimise drag and reduce fuel consumption. \nBoeing's new 787 Dreamliner also displayed a almost-vertical ascent in a recent test flight before the Paris Airshow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T00:13:31.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
