From surgery to going teetotal, we round up the weight loss secrets of other celebrity chefs. Jamie Oliver How much he lost: 2st How he did it: Eating more, but better - including less meat, more veg, and nutritious snacks such as seaweed and nuts. What he says: \"I lost 12 kilos quite quickly and I didn't do it through not eating. I ate a lot, more actually. Really it's about pushing the meat down, pushing the vegetables up, getting a good nights sleep and getting some continuity of movement.\" Tom Kerridge Photo: Andrew Crowley/BBC How much he lost: 9st How he did it: By going 'teetotal' and cutting down carbs What he says: \" I took up swimming and watching my carb intake . I stopped eating carbs late, and have got into eating fruit: I love apples and grapes as a snack now. I've gone down the route where I eat plenty of protein and not any carbs. I just ignore the potato bit, basically.\" Nigella Lawson Photo: Rex How much she lost: Less than 3st How she did it: Pilates, eating less and surgery... but not the kind you might expect. What she says: \"I had a very glamorous operation - a double bunionisation. I couldn't walk to the fridge afterwards and, actually, it's quite a good diet; not because I stopped eating but because you can say to someone, 'Can you get me a slice of cake?' but it's kind of embarrassing to say, 'And now could you get me a second slice?' So I haven't really eaten any different, but I had fewer opportunities to eat.\" Dean Edwards Photo: Dean Edwards How much he gained: 2st How he did it: Cut out sugar and unprocessed foods What he says: \"I wanted to get myself in the best shape I've ever been. I did a 12-week transformation programme with Sarah Lindsay, and the hardest part was the food side. I was lifting weights every day so I had to make sure I was getting enough calories. \"My diet pretty much consisted of protein, and I ate a lot of carbs. It's about eating the right thing at the right time, I believe in a balanced diet and I cut out unprocessed foods and sugar. If you start cooking things using fresh ingredients, you're halfway there already.\" Paula Deen Photo: Rex How much she lost: 2.5st How she did it: Stopped eating white foods What she says: \"Initially I went home to my kitchen and threw out everything that was white. White bread, white rice, white potatoes and white pasta. The thing that I'm trying to really focus on is moderation, moderation, moderation! You know, eat a cookie, just don't eat six of them.\" telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T04:43:01.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
