Controlled over centuries by the Dutch, the French, and then the English, the republic gained its independence in the late 1960s. Diversity has brought a wealth of cultural sites, including colorful Hindu temples and intricate mosques. The natural wonders of Mauritius range from orange-sherbet-colored sand dunes to dramatic waterfalls, salt pans, and coral reefs. The Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita arrived in October 2008, hugging the island’s eastern shoreline and a small private island between an Ernie Els championship gold course and the ocean. The property closed briefly this summer and reopened with the Sanctuary Collection of sprawling new suites. \nWhat to Expect: Even the smallest accommodations at the 136-room resort are stand-alone villas with private plunge pools. Thus, Four Seasons’ new three-bedroom Presidential Suite Sanctuary (about $11,600 per night) must be taken in that context. The suite can be expanded to five bedrooms by connecting to two adjacent One Bedroom Ocean Pool Villas (with this option, about $13,500 per night). The Presidential Suite Sanctuary is situated at the tip of the resort’s private island and features a new sunrise-facing master bedroom. Six Sanctuary Pool Villas (from about $1,275) offer either ocean views or steps leading down to the lagoon. Each includes a private infinity-edge pool and spacious living areas. \nHow to Get There: Through the resort, arrange a transfer by SUV, boat, or helicopter from Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport, which is about a 45-minute drive from the property.
