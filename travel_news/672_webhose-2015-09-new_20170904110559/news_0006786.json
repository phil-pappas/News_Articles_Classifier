As importantly the system will adapt to changes agents and suppliers may want in the future”\n \nSteve Whiston, product and solutions director of Cloud-works commented ‘The new reservation system, built from the ground up, is a dedicated B2B broker solution using the very latest Microsoft technologies. It is both flexible and scalable. The cloud-based system gives Your Car Hire the potential to expand and extend their range, whilst retaining the ability to respond quickly to agent and operator needs. The multi-distribution capability means that Your Car Hire can have new partners up and running in an instant.\n \nTo celebrate the launch of the new online booking system Your Car Hire are giving you the opportunity to win £100.00 worth of vouchers simply by making three bookings on the new online platform.
