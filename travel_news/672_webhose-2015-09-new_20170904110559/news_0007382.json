The company delivered strong financial, service and efficiency improvements in the first six months of 2015, but expects the second half of the year to be more challenging given intensifying headwinds in its coal markets.\n\"In the third quarter, we see strong pricing that reflects the value of our service, and we continue to drive greater asset utilization and reduce costs as we match our resources with demand while improving our service product,\" Eliasson said. \"At the same time, overall volume to date is down about two percent, with both our domestic coal and merchandise markets tracking slightly below the company's original third quarter expectations.\"\n\"While we continue to target flat earnings per share for the third quarter, achieving that estimate will be more challenging given the weaker than expected volumes,\" said Eliasson. \"In addition, with the volume declines this quarter and ongoing challenges to coal that are expected to continue in the fourth quarter, CSX now expects full-year earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits.\"\nThat earnings growth will be delivered despite domestic coal revenue declines that may exceed $400 million for the year. As CSX continues to focus on its value drivers of growing merchandise and intermodal business, value pricing and efficiency savings, the company still expects to drive meaningful full-year margin expansion this year as it progresses towards its longer term goal of a mid-60s operating ratio.\nAbout CSX Disclosures and the Company\nThis announcement, as well as additional financial information, is available on the company's website at http://investors.csx.com .
