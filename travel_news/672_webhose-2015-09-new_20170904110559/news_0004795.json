That's because the three-time defending Open champion could become the first woman to complete a calendar Grand Slam since Steffi Graf did it in 1988. (In July, the 33-year-old Williams completed her second so-called \"Serena Slam\" when she won Wimbledon and held all four major titles at the same time.) A seventh U.S. Open title would also be Williams' 22nd major, tying with Graf for the second most of all time. (Margaret Court has 24.)[caption id=\"attachment_1027\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Getty Images[/caption]Naturally, Williams was one of the headliners on opening night at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, and in addition to the celebrities who came out to watch her play—including Alec Baldwin , Martha Stewart , Katie Couric , and Amanda Seyfried—many more paid tribute to her in the #BeSerena video that aired before the match. It turns out that Sheryl Sandberg , Anna Wintour, Caitlyn Jenner, Chelsea Clinton and other stars want to be Serena.[caption id=\"attachment_1057\" align=\"\" width=\"1545\"] Adam Hunger/AP[/caption]Once Josh Groban warmed up the crowd with some Broadway show tunes and Vanessa Williams sang the national anthem, it was time for the evening's main event—and it was a bust. Serena Williams was thoroughly dominating her opening round opponent, Vitalia Diatchenko—6-0, 2-0—when the obviously injured 86th-ranked Russian retired.With that bizarre walkover, Williams is now just six more matches away from history.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/SerenaWilliams/videos/10153650591096834/"], "published": "2015-09-02T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T03:33:12.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
