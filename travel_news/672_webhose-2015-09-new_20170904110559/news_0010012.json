Courtesy Tourism Australia. News Corp Australia 03 Sep 2015 Lifestyle Travel \nTOURISM Australia is giving Japanese travellers the opportunity to get involved in a “supersized selfie” this weekend as part of its “There’s nothing like Australia” campaign. \nLaunching on the Gold Coast this Saturday, the “GIGA Selfie” event is part of Tourism Australia’s efforts to promote Australia to a younger and social media savvy Japanese consumer. \nTo take their enormous selfie, travellers stand on a designated spot and use the “GIGA Selfie” app on their smartphone to trigger a camera mounted in the distance, which captures their photo. \nThe selfie starts as a close up and then pulls back in a short video clip to reveal their location. A link is emailed to them for sharing. \nJapan is a key market for Tourism Australia with more than 320,000 Japanese visitors travelling here in the past year alone, contributing more than $1.4 billion in visitor spend. \nThe Gold Coast is one of the most popular and visited destinations among the Japanese in Australia, with emphasis being placed on Australia’s aquatic coastal experiences. The selfie will take in the surrounding landscape of the Gold Coast. Picture: Tourism Australia.

Dates and locations for future “GIGA Selfie” events will be confirmed through the campaign website . \nThe event kicks off on the Gold Coast from 11am to 4pm on Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T05:02:23.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
