First sailing is mid-October\". \nIt is currently in the Java Sea, according to the Marine Traffic website. \nInterislander general manager Mark Thompson said the Kaiarahi should arrive in Wellington towards the end of the month. \nSome work was still needed when the ferry docked in the capital including the installation of IT equipment, onboard services and additional passenger comforts. \nThere would also be several test sailings in the Cook Strait before taking on passengers and freight. \nThe first passengers were being booked for an October 12 sailing. \nCommercial sensitivity prevented the cost for the repairs and refurbishment being disclosed, Thompson said. \nFormerly known as the Stena Alegra, the ship was due to go into service between Wellington and Picton this month. However, it was left high and dry when more problems were discovered while it was in dry dock in Singapore. \nThe ferry had been in Singapore since April undergoing sea trials after receiving upgrades, including new lounges, a bar, stabilisers, navigation, engine room equipment, and gangway access. \nLast month, KiwiRail said the trials identified some wear inside the stern tubes, and it made sense to replace them while the ship was still in dry dock. \nPassengers and freight have been accommodated on Interislander's other ferries, the Kaitaki and Aratere. \nThe Swedish-owned Stena Alegra was drafted on to the Cook Strait run in late 2013 to fill in for the crippled Aratere, which had to have major repairs after losing a propeller in Cook Strait. \nBut the Stena Alegra did not fare much better. It broke down in Wellington Harbour in its first week of service, had propeller problems, and suffered a gash in its hull when it hit a Wellington wharf. \nIn December 2014, KiwiRail opted to charter the Stena Alegra for five years as a replacement for the 31-year old Arahura, rather than spending $250 million on a new ferry. It did not say how much it paid for the ferry, which it rebranded the Kaiarahi. \nNZ First leader Winston Peters was scathing in the decision to keep the Kaiarahi in service, declaring the ship a \"lemon\" and a \"rust bucket\". - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-17T00:07:20.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
