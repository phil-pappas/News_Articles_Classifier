Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul presided over the Thailand Health and Wellness Tourism Showcase 2015 yesterday, which unveiled the latest anti-aging and aesthetic innovation in Thailand. \nH.E. Kobkarn said, “Thailand is the premier medical tourism destination with our wealth of internationally-recognised medical facilities. Health and medical tourists are among the lucrative visitor markets for Thailand due to their high-spending power and demand for upscale tourism products and services, which is in line with our policy to focus on promoting Thailand as a “Quality Leisure Destination through Thainess.” \nThe Thailand Health and Wellness Tourism Showcase 2015 under the concept of Anti-Aging: The Next Big Thing in Health Tourism is being held from 14 to 17 September, 2015. \nThe event kicked off with a trade conference and business matching day on 14 September, bringing 56 medical tourism facilitators and travel agencies as well as international press and social media influencers from 20 countries up to speed with Thailand’s capabilities as the premier destination for health and wellness tourism. \nThe day was filled with informative presentations on various interesting topics, especially anti-aging innovation in Thailand; endotherapia discovering your body’s inner cell; revitalise your life with hormone replacement therapy; nutraceutical: the anti-aging pill, and cell therapy a breakthrough in anti-aging. \nThe 56 buyers also had the opportunity to discuss prospective business deals with the top 36 anti-aging and aesthetic providers in Thailand, including hospitals, anti-aging clinics, aesthetic clinics, plastic surgery clinics, medical spas, sport medicine centres, and health resorts. \nMrs. Juthaporn Rerngsonasa, TAT’s Deputy Governor for International Marketing (Europe, Africa, Middle East and Americas) said, “The average expenditure of the health and medical tourists in Thailand is about 50,000 – 300,000 Baht per trip, and they prefer to stay in five-star accommodation.
