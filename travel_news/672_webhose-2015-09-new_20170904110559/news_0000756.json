Visit the Sacred Valley of Peru Spiritual Yogi on a Budget? Visit the Sacred Valley of Peru Peru , South America \nSo you want to get your yoga on in some exotic country without spending an arm and a leg for some fancy retreat? Good news, it´s possible. Scattered throughout the sacred valley of Peru and beyond, you can find some of the coolest and cheapest yoga work-trade opportunities in all of South America. If you can get yourself there, all you need is a mat, an able body and enough stamina to work a light work-week in exchange for good food, accommodation and spiritual enlightenment that will last you a lifetime. \nChakra Alegria de Amor Rainforest Healing Center \nA spiritual and alternative healing center, Chakra Alegria de Amor , offers a work-trade program on an unconventional permaculture farm in the amazon forest of Peru,. For a $300 donation you can stay on the farm for a month and participate in modalities such as yoga, reiki and traditional healing ceremonies working with the enchanted plant of Ayahuasca, a natural plant-based medicine that induces visions and hallucinations (and don´t worry, this type of ¨magical plant¨ is legal in Peru). If you are looking for an off-the-grid and nonconformist yoga / spiritual retreat, this is the place to do it. It could be the trip of the century. \nParamatma Holistic Healing Center \nLocated in the spiritual epicenter of Peru, Paramatma Holistic Healing Center , located in Cusco, offers yoga retreats and modalities such as Reiki, Chakra balancing, Craniosacral Therapy and Yoga Classes all at reasonable prices. A typical yoga retreat, where you will share a sacred communal living space, delicious food, and invigorating yoga classes costs around $90 dollars for two day retreat. If fire ceremonies, yoga and trekking to waterfalls and ancient inca ruins sounds like your cup of tea, check out this place for updates on discounts on workshops and opportunities to volunteer in exchange for their healing modalities. \nEcoTruly Park, Peru \nIf tropical coastline is more of your ¨Flow¨ then check out Ecotruly Park , a Peruvian Eco Village located on Chacra y Mar beach, just a 65 km north of Lima. Modalities include yoga workshops, spiritual philosophy and the opportunity to sink your toes and fingers into the earth while working on their ecofarm. Cost is a mere $300 dollars a month in exchange for room and board. People from all over the world flock to this coastal eco-sanctuary to rejoice, rejuvenate and live a simple life most people can only dream of. Since it´s affordable enough, it doesn’t have to be a dream anymore! \nHave you done work-trade in Peru?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T15:47:44.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
