(AP) — Firefighters in Central California on Thursday say the state’s largest wildfire threatens to sweep through an ancient grove of Giant Sequoia trees considered to be a national treasure.\nFirefighters are clearing lines with bulldozers around the Grant Grove and putting up sprinklers, said Andy Isolano, a spokesman for the Clovis Fire Department.\nAlthough Isolano said the trees can endure fire, some are stressed in the four-year drought and they’re not taking any chances because the fast-moving flames are about 5 miles from the grove.\nIt is named for the towering General Grant tree that stands 268 feet tall. There are dozens of Sequoia groves in the Sierra Nevada, and some trees are 3,000 years old.\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Russell Wilson buys $6.7 million waterfront mansion in Bellevue, report says Kam Chancellor speaks to NFL Network, says he’s willing ‘to meet the Seahawks halfway’ Empty classes, no talks as Seattle schools stalemate continues ‘Passport day’ coming up in Seattle Struggling Haggen files for bankruptcy protection, parts with Southwest co-CEO Lightning strikes on July 31 sparked the wildfire in the Kings Canyon National Park east of Fresno. It has charred 172 square miles and is less than one-third contained.\nMeanwhile, lions, tigers and other cats big and small are being evacuated as California’s biggest wildfire continues to spread, possibly threatening the park where they live, officials said Thursday.\nCat Haven in Fresno County, where the fire has been burning for nearly six weeks, is closing temporarily. Officials are also advising more residents to be ready to evacuate as the stubborn blaze spreads.\nNearly three dozen wild cats will soon be moved from the 100-acre site just west of King’s Canyon National Park.\nThe foothill communities of Dunlap, Miramonte, and Pinehurst are under evacuation warnings.\nKFSN reports (http://abc30.tv/1EQkfIf) the cats will go south to the Los Angeles area, while others will stay in the Fresno area. The Fresno Chaffee Zoo is also assisting.\nAnother wildfire in Northern California that exploded in size has destroyed six homes in Amador County as evacuations remained in place Thursday, Cal Fire officials said. Two outbuildings were also destroyed. It is about 20 percent contained and has spread to nearby Calaveras County.\nAnother wildfire above Yosemite Valley grew to 500 acres, sending plumes of smoke visible throughout the park, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. Trails on the north rim of Yosemite Valley south of the Tioga Road and east of Yosemite Creek are closed, Gediman said. The causes of the fires are under investigation.\nMeanwhile police in Orange County arrested a man on suspicion of starting a fire Tuesday that burned 80 acres and came close to neighborhoods in La Habra and Fullerton before it was fully contained.\nPaul Munoz, 56, of Fullerton, was charged with negligently causing a fire with injuries; two firefighters sustained minor injuries fighting the blaze.\nFullerton police said they believe the fire began in a transient encampment.\nIt’s unclear if Munoz has an attorney.\n___\nInformation from: KFSN-TV.\nSCOTT SMITH KRISTIN J.
