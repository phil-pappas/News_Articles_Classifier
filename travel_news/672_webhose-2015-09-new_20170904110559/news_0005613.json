It will also introduce Specialty Tours, featuring revised content and running three times per day, Monday through Friday.\nFall programming includes:\nWake up with Yoga : 10/3, 11/7, 12/5; 9 a.m.\nInstructors from Core Power Yoga will teach 60-minute classes in the Glasshouse. The centerpiece of Chihuly Garden and Glass, a 40-foot tall, glass and steel structure covering 4,500 square feet of light-filled space, the Glasshouse is the result of Chihuly's lifelong appreciation for conservatories. Walk with the Gardener : 10/8, 11/5, 12/17; 9:30 a.m.\nWith the distinction of being the first natural environment created specifically to showcase a Chihuly exhibition, the Garden at Chihuly Garden and Glass offers a special look at the interaction of plants and the artist's work. Join us for a private, pre-open garden tour and Q&A with the Chihuly Garden and Glass gardening team. In this 60-minute experience, we will share our overall landscaping design and philosophy, walk you through our winter and spring plantings, review our master plant list and offer some home gardening tips. Chihuly through the Lens : 10/24, 11/11, 12/19; 9 a.m.\nThe most comprehensive collection of Chihuly's artwork on public view, a visit to Chihuly Garden and Glass often leaves guests thinking about color, art, and the act of creation in a new way. We invite you to channel that inspiration through the lens in a two-hour, early access photo session. For this special session only, photographers of all levels can bring tripods (no lights, please) and take advantage of unobstructed views of the installations. Specialty Tours and Gallery Talks : Tours: Mon.-Fri.; Gallery Talks: daily\nExhibition Hosts will lead a series of themed tours focused around new and updated content. Gallery Talks will occur in between tours on Mon.-Fri. and hourly on Sat. and Sun. Gallery Talks will rotate through the galleries, highlighting various features for an in-depth viewing experience.
