My family, all be it, is not of fillipino decent but we all grew up in a prodaminantly fillipino area, Downtown Los Angelas to be exact. We are probably the most ethnicaly mixed family you will ever come across in Southern California. This Recipe For Adobo isnt the one that i grew up with but it does sound equally deliciouse. I ommit the Brown sugar and add bay leaf and some other things. i make traditional comfort foods from when i was a child. Soo i keep the old stuff the way i learned it but all in all this was a pretty good mix up!!! Heres a picture of my traditional chiken adobo!! Its EPIC!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-06T08:31:12.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
