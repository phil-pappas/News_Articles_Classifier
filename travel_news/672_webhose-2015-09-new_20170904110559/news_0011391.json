Chinese guests can obtain hotel information in-language across the entire Four Seasons portfolio. At select properties, this feature also allows guests to make reservations, access services and view expert local recommendations from Four Seasons concierges in Simplified Chinese.\nEnglish language features across the entire Four Seasons portfolio include the ability to make and manage reservations in multiple locations at once, efficient check-in and check-out, options to make special requests in advance of arrival, and on-the-go room service orders and restaurant reservations.\nLaunched earlier this year, the multi-functional, content-rich Four Seasons App offers guests an opportunity to customise their stay on the go. With just a few taps, travellers can access a wide array of services and personal options wherever and whenever they wish.\nThe Four Seasons Recommends feature has proven to be extremely popular with guests. It offers expert local recommendations for every hotel in the portfolio, including restaurants, shopping, attractions and activities sorted into “moods” to make trip planning a breeze, plus personal recommendations of hundreds of Four Seasons hotel concierges who know their destination best.\nSource:-Four Seasons", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T19:05:52.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
