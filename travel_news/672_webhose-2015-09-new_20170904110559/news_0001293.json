Photograph by: Michel Euler , The Associated Press \nPARIS - The floral scents wafted into the 19th-century Parisian courtyard Friday outside the launch of famed French perfumer Fragonard's first flagship perfume museum . \nThe sprawling building — once home to a lewd Parisian theatre and later a chic velodrome — was renovated for two years to showcase the unique history and techniques behind the creation of perfume. \n\"The idea is to share our savoir-faire. It makes everyone dream. France is reputed for perfume, so our aim is to share the treasures we have accumulated,\" said Agnes Costa Webster, great-granddaughter of Fragonard founder Jean-Francois Costa, who delved into the family's vast collections to create the museum. \nShe unearthed hundreds of art objects, exotic vials, age-old distilleries and olfactory apparatus that are now presented to the public, many for the first time, alongside black-and-white archive footage. \nAside from the history, a new major museum — now among several other smaller museums in Paris dedicated to scents — demonstrates both perfume's increased popularity and its status as the financial backbone of today's globalized luxury industry. \n\"There are marvels in the contemporary perfumery creation,\" Costa Webster said. \"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T09:35:59.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
