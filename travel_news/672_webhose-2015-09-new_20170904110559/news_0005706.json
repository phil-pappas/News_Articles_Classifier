And it bakes physical gags into the text, that the Bard’s crew could run with.\nTheater review ‘The Comedy of Errors’ by William Shakespeare. Through Oct. 11, Seattle Shakespeare Company at Seattle Repertory Theatre; $25-$50 (206-733-8222 or seattleshakespeare.org ).\nInventing shtick that captivates modern patrons who reflexively turn up their noses at slapstick is no joke. But the best thing in Seattle Shakespeare Company’s new staging of “Comedy” at Seattle Repertory Theatre’s Leo K. Theatre is the nimble funny business devised by director and clowning expert Jane Nichols.\n Actors swing like monkeys from the long pendulum of a crazy-clock. They whiz down a steep ramp on bicycles, and torturously try to crawl up same. They attack with rubber swords, they mug, stumble and freak. And after some dull preliminaries, they can be very amusing indeed.\nCraig Wollam’s whitewashed single set has Hellenic accents, in deference to the comedy’s ancient Greek setting. But it’s really a playground for cavorting zanies.\nJay Myers shamelessly, rewardingly zests up the role of Antipholus of Syracuse — the traveler who gets embroiled in the adulterous shenanigans of his long-lost identical twin, Antipholus of Ephesus (David Brown King).\nAdding to the fools’ frenzy: the gangly, bike-riding servants, Dromio of Ephesus (Kevin Kelly) and Dromio of Syracuse (Arjun Pande), who look enough alike that you lose track of who’s who.\nKevin Bordi, Spencer Hamp and others are a hoot in smaller roles, while the women make merry too. Samie Spring Detzer and Julie Briskman remind you how choice a well-turned, wordless double-take of confusion, lust, annoyance or discomfort can be.\nAnd who knew bouzouki music can be funny? It is here.\nSome repeated gags are milked dry, as is Myers’ too drawn out preparing-for-battle bit.\nWhat this Seattle Shakes season-opener has in spades, however, is something most welcome in classic comedy outings: a flair for both the ridiculous and the droll.\nMisha Berson: mberson@seattletimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T12:11:22.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
