I don't even like baths. So it's a little bit strange that I ended up at a hot springs for a night.\nYet here I was, dipping toes in the pools next to the historic bath house at Mt. Princeton Hot Springs , looking for something hotter, something that would elicit that physical rush of is it too hot? and compel me to sink into the question. And I was looking for something that wasn't a big ol' pool. I wanted to soak, alone. I needed to chill out in hot water and not do anything else for at least five minutes.\nI'd arrived later than I'd wanted to after sitting in rush-hour traffic in Denver. After a quick bite in the restaurant (and the obligatory Elevation beer), I was grabbing my pool bag at nearly 10 p.m. to head down to the bath house. The pools closed at 11. It was enough time, if I could find the right spot.\nToeing the big pools, though, I was kicking myself for not taking a closer look at the map. I knew there were smaller pools out here somewhere. So, towel-wrapped against the cool night air, I exited the pool to check out Chalk Creek, which runs right through the resort. Here, along the creek, was what I needed.\nAdvertisement People were sitting in the edge of the creek, in tiny makeshift pools formed with river rocks, presumably blocking the cold creek water from hot-spring seep. Two women were hoisting themselves up the short wall along the creek as I walked up. I glanced down at the pool below.\n\"Good spot?\" I asked them.\n\"Yeah,\" one said, wide-eyed. \"It's hot.\"\nI dropped my flip-flops and sat on the wall, lowering myself down to a river rock. There are low lights along the walkway next to the river, but the moon was just short of full that night, so there was enough light on the water to see the gravel and sand as I stepped in. Heat, not cold, hit my ankle, and I sunk in the rest of the way, turning to recline on a current-worn stone. Surprise puffs of cold from the creek sometimes floated in as a reminder that I was still in a mountain stream, still in a wild place. The brightest stars showed themselves, unblinded by the moon.\nSoaking's not my thing, but maybe I can make an exception for hot springs in a cold river under a night sky.\nThe morning view from the Cliffside lodging at Mt. Princeton Hot Springs. Cliffside is high above the lodge and hot springs, but the views are worth the walk. ( Jenn Fields, The Denver Post ) Mt. Princeton Hot Springs had been seeping into my mind all summer. A newsletter from the resort lands in my inbox regularly, and every time I see it, I think about my first (and before this, only) visit there 20 years ago. I was camping in the area with my college boyfriend. We drove to the hot springs looking for a shower as much as a soak. (It might have been the day after we hiked up Mt. Elbert, I can't remember for sure.)\nThere wasn't much here back then, and the showers of the historic bath house looked a lot more, um, historic.\n\"It was a little neglected back then,\" said Evelyn Marshall, general manager at Mt. Princeton Hot Springs. The current owner bought the property in 2006, she said, and built the cabins that are there now. \"That was the biggest expansion, the lodging on the property.\" The lodge building and spa were built three years ago.\nAfter my river soak, I headed back to my room in Cliffside, a long, low row perched on a hillside looking south across the resort. The Cliffside lodging has been there since the '60s, Marshall said, but it has been overhauled. It still felt like a throwback: my bathroom was small but otherwise modern, and the furniture was current but hinted at midcentury.\nWith a full belly and a soak under my belt, I zonked out. Light seeped into my room early the next morning (the curtains are dark, I just didn't shut them tight). I blinked back sleep and pulled on a jacket to step onto my patio. Sunrise blushed the hills, and all was quiet, minus the other Cliffside guests who had crept outside to sip coffee on their patios and watch the show. This is the furthest lodging from the hot springs, and it might seem disappointing to some to be far from the main reason to be here (along with the terrific restaurant and the spa, both down the hill as well). But watching the light fill the valley, turning the chalk cliffs that formed the backdrop hot white, I knew that once again, I'd found the right spot.\nJenn Fields: 303-954-1599, jfields@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jennfields", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0903/20150903__20150906_E9_TR06COLUMN~p2.jpg", "http://www.mtprinceton.com/"], "published": "2015-09-03T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T21:19:04.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
