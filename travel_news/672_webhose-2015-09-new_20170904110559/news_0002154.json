Credit: PA Bournemouth council says “severe financial challenges” facing all local authorities have left them with no choice but raise charges.\nThese are some of the proposed changes:\nAt Bath Road and Beacon Road car parks it would cost £12 for a stay of up to six hours – up from £6.60. Parking on East Overcliff Drive would rise from £2.60 to £6 for up to 6 hours. At Bourne Avenue, Braidley Road, Hinton Road and Madeira Road, two hours would rise from £1.30 to £3. A 12-month town centre parking permit at Winter Gardens or Keystone House would rise by £100 to £750. Longer stays at town centre car parks like Cotlands Road and Lansdowne Road are frozen at £3.50 for four hours and £4 for up to 24 hours. For over four years, the council haven’t put their charges up, so the chamber are not jumping up and down against this.\nWe’ve got to be realistic that the council are going through a huge amount of cuts. Because they’ve supported us in the town for so long, through the recession and, not lifted anything, I think it’s acceptable and understandable.\n– Mandy Payne, past president of Bournemouth Chamber of Trade and Commerce Last updated Wed 16 Sep 2015 Read more 2 updates Parking charges in Bournemouth to rise amid cuts Consumer Dorset Bournemouth", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T01:26:30.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
