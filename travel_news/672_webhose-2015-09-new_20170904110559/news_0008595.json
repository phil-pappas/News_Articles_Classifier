I had traveled to Central America a year prior for three months, but had not experienced this type of feeling until about half-way through my trip. I felt homesick, unmotivated, and distant from the culture around me. I could only equate it to one thing: The Travelers Slump. \nThe Travelers Slump can happen to any traveler journeying through any part of the world. Suddenly, it seems as though you become hyperaware of your surroundings and seek refuge in anything that reminds you of home. \nIf you are planning on taking a trip through South America for (any) duration of time, follow the tips below to either help avoid, or cope with the Travelers Slump. 1) Mix with the culture It may sound contradictory, but if you start to notice you are craving the familiar, don’t immediately call home, and don’t run to the nearest American chain store. Get out of the house and join in on something culturally relevant to whatever South American city you are currently visiting. For instance, in Bolivia many people have roots in indeginous indian cultures. They dance and sing in the surrounding plazas of the city. When I feel down, I visit the plazas, park myself on a bench, and breathe in the wonderment of a new world. 2) Exercise Many people forget to exercise while traveling. Exercise is vital for the maintenance of a healthy mind and spirt while abroad. In South America, it can be difficult to feel safe enough to run outside, and gyms are sparse. However, I have found that even thirty minutes of stretching can alleviate the feelings associated with the Traveler’s Slump. If you have come to know the streets of you town or city, grab a friends and go for a twenty minute jog. It should help clear up the foggy mind and feelings associated with the Traveler’s Slump. 3) Learn the local language Grab your 501 Spanish Verb Conjugation book and start reading. Sure it’s slightly boring and monotonous, but it will help you switch from your right brain(which is responsible for your emotional center) to your left brain. After conjugating the past, present, and imperfect you may find yourself thinking more clearly and rationally- And hey, you may even learn a thing or two. How have you dodged the Traveler’s Blues?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T03:10:36.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
