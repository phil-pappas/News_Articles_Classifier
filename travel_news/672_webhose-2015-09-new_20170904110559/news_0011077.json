Hastings & Hastings would like to see this number reduced to zero.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150901/263043LOGO\nHastings & Hastings acknowledges the stress of driving, especially during the heat of summer as temperatures rise and tempers start to fray. Traffic conditions can add to this stress. No one likes to be trapped in bumper to bumper traffic on State Route 51 or the 101 loop.\nHastings & Hastings encourages drivers to consider traffic conditions before they begin their commute. If commuters know ahead of time that they are going to be encountering difficult traffic conditions, they can plan ahead accordingly. Drivers can leave 15-20 minutes early to ensure that they can arrive to their destination on time. A good deal of driving stress is the result of poor planning. A commuter who is stuck in traffic knowing they are going to be late to their destination experiences more stress then a commuter stuck in the same traffic who will be arriving on time.\nStress is one of the leading causes of road rage. It can build slowly over time without drivers even realizing they are under its effects. The result of this stress may be what psychiatrists call \"intermittent explosive disorder\" or IED. This is the rage that gathers as a result of a number of minor incidents. Getting cut off once or twice may be a minor annoyance; being tailgated, honked at, cutoff, or sped by 10-15 times during a commute could lead to IED.\n\"I encourage people to engage in stress management as a way to reduce road rage. Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, and get some exercise, these are all excellent ways to reduce your stress level. If you find yourself experiencing some anger while driving, maybe take a deep breath and count to ten,\" said David Hastings , founder of Hastings and Hastings. \"I would love for Arizona drivers to be known as the most courteous in the nation,\" he added.\nRoad rage related deaths and injuries are always tragic, and almost completely avoidable. Hastings & Hastings is excited to work with the community towards the goal of reducing road rage on our Arizona streets.\nContact Information\nKristy Guell\nkristy.guell@hastingsandhastings.com\n(480) 706-1100\n releases/hastings--hastings-speaks-out-about-stress-and-road-rage-300136560.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY92238&Transmission_Id=201509020700PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY92238&DateId=20150902", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hastings--hastings-speaks-out-about-stress-and-road-rage-300136560.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150901/263043LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:26:40.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
