In an effort to spread awareness about the critical threats facing the population and to support various organizations fighting for rhino conservation , Lion World Travel has partnered with major organizations and launched several campaigns, including a \"Name the Little Rhino\" campaign that was selected as a Travel Weekly 2015 Gold Magellan Award Winner. The \"Name the Little Rhino\" campaign stemmed from a partnership with the Entabeni Safari Conservancy's Rhino Orphanage, which supports the development of healthy baby rhinos that have been left orphaned by poachers. Lion World Travel donated to the orphanage and asked its substantial community of world travelers to help name one of their resident rhinos. After a very successful and far-reaching campaign, the community selected \"Kidogo,\" which means \"little\" in Swahili. This campaign was chosen for a Gold Magellan Award in Travel Weekly 's Tour Operations Advertising/Marketing Campaign category. Lion World also utilized social media in 2014 to raise awareness about the devastating effects of rhino poaching through a #ShareIfYouCare campaign. Each time this Lion World Travel page was shared, $0.50 was donated to the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) in support of their Rhino Conservation Project. Thanks to the strong support of their community, Lion World reached its goal of receiving 20,000 shares and in turn donated $10,000 to the EWT. Lion World partnered with The TreadRight Foundation , a not-for-profit organization established by Lion World's parent company The Travel Corporation (TTC), to introduce the Wildlife Initiative , which brings together noteworthy projects to help ensure that Africa's Big Five never becomes the Big Four . By working with WildAid, Lion World is helping to reduce the demand for illegal wildlife products through public education and awareness campaigns featuring an international network of influencers. Lion World also works with The Wilderness Foundation in South Africa, which supports project-driven conservation to protect rhinos on the ground, combat poachers, and care for rhinos in South Africa . To witness these majestic creatures firsthand, travel to the Entabeni Safari Conservancy and Cape Town on Lion World's nine-night \" Majestic South Africa .\" Guests spend four nights in splendid five-star luxury in Cape Town's acclaimed Twelve Apostles Hotel and Spa before starting their safari at the five-star Hanglip Mountain Lodge . Guests take a scenic helicopter flight over the 22,000 hectare conservancy, where the Big Five - including the rhino! - roam wild, and observe the region's richly diverse wildlife populations on frequent open-vehicle game drives. This special package includes international roundtrip flights from New York or Washington, D.C. to Johannesburg as well as add-ons from 38 major US cities and is priced from $3,499 on specific travel dates.
