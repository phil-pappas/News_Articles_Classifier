You are supposed to be behaving as though this is your normal fashion – don’t stick out like a sore thumb.’\nThese are some of his top tips for guests who don’t normally stay the night in exclusive hotels.\nWhat to wear\nDress codes at five-star hotels have loosened significantly over the last 10 years, but that doesn’t mean guests shouldn’t dress the part.\nMr Hanson recommends visitors play it safe.\n Next American beauty: A journey by tall ship exploring the...

Wear a very smart pair of jeans or more formal sort of chinos or slacks, and a collared shirt.\n‘Part of the whole five-star experience for everyone is you follow a set code and if you don’t like it you find another hotel.’\nA suit jacket is not a requirement at check-in, but one may be required in the hotel restaurant or bar.\nIf in doubt, ask a member of staff about the dress code, or take a look around the restaurant about 30 minutes before the reservation to see what other diners are wearing.\nGuests should wear smart clothing when they check in, although a suit jacket is not a requirement\nHow to conduct yourself\nA night at a luxury hotel can be a thrilling or overwhelming experience, but those who make it a rare treat should do everything they can to avoid looking like a fish out of water when they walk through the door.\nMr Hanson said: ‘At check-in and throughout your stay, don’t necessarily act like you’ve never been at a five-star hotel before. Don’t look around and say, “Gosh, look at this, it’s so shiny”.\n‘You want to act as if you stay at five-star hotels every weekend.\n‘Don’t start going around and taking photographs, either. It shows you’re not used to this sort of thing. If you want to show your friends back home what the hotel looks like show them the hotel website.’\nWHAT MAKES A FIVE-STAR HOTEL? The term 'five-star hotel' is synonymous with luxury and class, but a hotel must meet a wide range of stringent criteria to earn the prestigious title.\nThey must offer luxurious accommodation and public areas, including a spacious reception hall, and there must be 24-hour reception and room service.\nGuests must be greeted by staff at the hotel entrance, and there must be a concierge to assist with any planning or transportation needs.\nTurndown service in the evening is another requirement, and the cleanliness, maintenance, hospitality and delivery of services must adhere to an extreme high standard.\nFive-star hotels also require a restaurant with a high quality menu and wine list, and at least one permanent luxury suite comprised of three separate rooms – a bedroom, lounge and bathroom.\nIn the UK, five-star hotels must also offer extensive fitness and spa facilities, valet parking and a full afternoon tea.\nDining etiquette\nFive-star hotels are required to have a restaurant with a high-quality menu and wine list, and the staff are held to a much higher standard for service.\nThat means guests who aren’t used to eating at top-end restaurants should be prepared to have a lot more interaction with the wait staff.\nMr Hanson said: ‘They bring extra things such as bread, maybe a sorbet in between courses [and] they decrumb your table. There is a lot more going on than in Pizza Express.’\nDiners should sit back and allow the wait staff to do their jobs, he said, adding: ‘Keep still or don’t wave your arms about in conversation because you may hit a waiter or knock a tray over.\n‘Be slightly more dignified and be aware of what is going on around you.’\nGuests who don’t understand one of the menu items should not be afraid to ask their server for an explanation, and they should close their menu and memorize their choices when they are ready to order.\nHow to tip\nGuests should have some extra pocket change to tip staff throughout their stay.\nPorters are normally tipped £1 or $1 for every bag that is delivered to the hotel room when a guest checks in and out.\nThe same rule of thumb applies for valet parking.\nHousekeeping staff tend to be forgotten about, as guests may not see them at all during their stay. Leaving £2 or $2 a night, along with a thank you note, is acceptable.\nFive-star hotels offer turndown service in the evening, and it’s a good idea to leave something for those members of the housekeeping staff on the final night before leaving the room for dinner.\nAt the hotel restaurant or bar, service charges are normally included in the bill.\nGuests who spot Kanye West or Kim Kardashian at their hotel should avoid asking for a selfie\nHow to act around celebrities\nHigh-end hotels attract a clientele that includes business moguls, politicians, actors and musicians, so it’s not unusual to share an elevator with a celebrity or spot one in the lobby.\nIf they appear to be on holiday, treat them like any other guest and afford them privacy, said Mr Hanson.\nHe said: ‘If you pass each other in the corridor smile or say hello. Don’t start pestering them for autographs or selfies – they are on holiday, too.’\nDon't hog the sunloungers\nThere are plenty of stories every year about British travellers heading abroad to a budget resort and scrambling to reserve a sunlounger before a pool or beach becomes crowded.\nWhen it comes to a five-star resort in an idyllic destination such as the Maldives or St Lucia, the rules are much different.\nAt these resorts, Mr Hanson said, it is OK to 'reserve' a sunlounger with a towel, but there is a catch.\nHe said: 'You need to be on it within a maximum of 30 minutes after reserving the lounger. In busy periods this window shrinks to 10 minutes, in my opinion.'\nHow can the concierge help?\nA hotel concierge can be a very helpful source of information during a stay in a new city, although guests who stay at swanky hotels may not know how to get the most from this service.\nAn excellent concierge will know the city like the back of their hand and be well connected to help with restaurant reservations or secure tickets to the theatre, a concert or sporting event.\nThey can provide maps or travel guides, and go through a list of activities in the area.\nMr Hanson said: They are there for the duration of your stay and you can use them as you like. You can never talk to them or you can use them all the time.’\nHe also suggests guests take some time to read the hotel information booklet in their room to find out which services are on offer.\nRead more: William Hanson, the UK's leading Etiquette Coach | William Hanson", "external_links": ["http://williamhanson.co.uk/", "http://dailym.ai/1Ow1kp4"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T19:10:51.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
