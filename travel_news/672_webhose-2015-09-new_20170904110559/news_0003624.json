Picture: REUTERS/SIEGFRIED MODOLA Related articles CAR capital paralysed by wave of violence Violent protests erupt in CAR’s capital BANGUI — The Central African Republic’s president appealed for calm on Tuesday as the United Nations (UN) reported 36 people dead and 30,000 displaced in three days of bloodshed in the capital Bangui.\n\"We fear that the violence we’re seeing in Bangui is a return to the dark days of late 2013 and 2014, when thousands were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes,\" UN Human High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Leo Dobbs said.\nAt least 36 people died in the past three days and 27,400 fled their homes, the UN said.\nAnnouncing she was cutting short a visit to the UN General Assembly in New York to return home, interim President Catherine Samba Panza said in a message broadcast on national radio: \"I appeal to you my compatriots for calm. I ask you to return to your homes. I know that when I speak to you, you listen.\"\nIn Geneva, Mr Dobbs said 10,000 of those who fled had taken refuge at Bangui international airport, already hosting about 11,000 people. \"There is great difficulty getting to the airport,\" he said.\n\"There are barricades in the streets and there was shooting going on this morning. The displaced people are reported to be in a state of shock.\"\nFears of a sudden refugee influx saw the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo announce the immediate closure of its northern border with the landlocked former French colony.\nThe border is closed \"until further notice\" due to the \"uncontrollable situation in Central Africa\", government spokesman Lambert Mende said in Kinshasa. The country was not \"a conduit for the insecurity of others\", he said.\nOne in 10 Central Africans — 460,000 people — have sought refuge outside the country, mainly in Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Congo.\nIn Bangui, shots continued to ring out even after the lifting of a dusk-to-dawn curfew, following a night of sporadic shooting as security forces sought to repel looters, an AFP correspondent said.\nWith barricades blocking traffic, central Bangui stood largely empty as French and UN peacekeepers patrolled key areas.\nThe UN peacekeeping force has denied reports that its troops killed three people and injured others after opening fire on a crowd of demonstrators heading towards the presidency to demand Ms Samba Panza’s resignation. But it pledged to look into the allegations. The 10,000-strong peacekeeping force is already facing 17 damaging accusations of sex abuse. French troops, who number 1,000, face separate sex abuse allegations.\nAcross the city, streets were deserted as people stayed at home for fear of fresh fighting and to avoid attacks by looters, with only an occasional taxi visible.\nUN spokesman Rupert Colville said in Geneva that about 500 prisoners had escaped from Bangui’s main prison overnight, adding to the feeling of insecurity.\n\"This is a huge setback for the preservation of law and order, and for the fight against impunity, which has been and remains a chronic problem in Central African Republic,\" he said.\nOvernight, shooting erupted as security forces tried to stop looters from attacking the premises of humanitarian organisations which had been evacuated for security reasons, a military source said.\nLooters targeted the offices of the UN World Food Programme, French medical nongovernmental organisation Premiere Urgence and the Dutch nongovernmental organisation Cordaid, police said, indicating that they had repelled them in several places.\n\"Attacks on the civilian population and the targeting of humanitarian workers who deliver lifesaving aid must stop immediately,\" the European Union said.\nThe latest round of violence in two years of unrest broke out on Saturday after a motorcycle taxi driver was murdered in the Muslim-majority PK-5 neighbourhood of Bangui. The unrest spread to other districts, medical and humanitarian sources said.\nAbout 100 people have been wounded in the bloodshed, prompting the government to impose a curfew on the capital.\nPK-5 was the epicentre of a wave of violence between Christians and Muslims in late 2013 and early last year.\nIt remains the last bastion for Muslims hounded out of other districts by Christian militias.\nThe Central African Republic descended into bloodshed two years ago after long-time leader Francois Bozize was ousted by fighters in the mainly Muslim Seleka force, triggering the worst crisis since independence in 1960.\nSince then, the country has been gripped by violence between the Seleka fighters and Christian militias known as \"antibalaka\" or antimachete.\nThough the violence has subsided since last year, there is still a high crime rate fuelled in part by easy access to weapons used in the sectarian conflict.\nPresidential and legislative elections are due to be held by the end of the year, but they have already been pushed back several times as the country continues to grapple with the crisis.\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T19:24:10.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
