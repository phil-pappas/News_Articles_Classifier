The near-collapse of the world economy in 2008 and SA’s parastatal crisis exposed the massive manipulation of information by corporate executives to enrich themselves at investor and public expense.\nThis resulted in a new obsession with governance and rules, symptomatic of the erroneous assumption that complex problems can have simple, generalised solutions. It makes the arrogant yet naive leap of faith that, if one is expert enough, one can mitigate risks and the vagaries implicit in the market, corruption and other accidents of the human condition.\nThe same paradigm has spawned leadership gurus purveying books and packaged courses that reduce the complex, subtle and context-dependent art of leadership to a number of steps or habits as if these are applicable to all situations.\nYet successful business people continually surprise and confound the rule makers, case-study writers, journalists, analysts and academics by following their own judgment and dealing with dilemma-ridden reality with creativity, pragmatism and vision.\nThe obsession with governance and leadership principles has resulted in the rationale behind an executive’s decision, the quality of the decision-making process, the circumstances and relevant details mattering less than whether procedures were followed. This trumping of form over substance — red-tape over common sense — diverts attention and resources away from what is really important and inevitably results in decline.\nOur parastatal crisis, for example, is in part due to \"ticking\" the Public Finance Management Act’s boxes, instead of analysing and dealing with individual dilemmas, weighing up alternatives and taking calculated risks. A parastatal executive is just as likely to be vilified for genuinely aiming to do what’s best for the organisation, but breaking some rules to do it — as he would for enriching himself at the public expense.\nIn the name of good governance, it is therefore unsurprising that procurement processes are so attenuated; that service delivery is delayed and the reasons for this are so obscured — which is why there seems to have been so little learning. At the same time, lawyers and other governance professionals, who form part of this growing industry, have benefited greatly.\nIn SA an increased focus on governance codes has run parallel with wholesale political interference, the wilful ignoring of expert opinion and the rampant corruption that have destroyed some of our parastatals. For example, the Eskom board of the early 2000s ignored informed advice to build new power stations, paving the way for the energy shortage that has so jeopardised our economy.\nGood governance is ultimately about good leadership, which depends on context as much as it does on principles. The fact remains that there exists no reliable way to measure leadership behaviour so that investors and other stakeholders can derive valid and objective governance assessment. One has to observe and experience leadership to appreciate its quality. So, while surveys and tests conceal more than they reveal, anybody who has attended a board meeting will be able to distinguish between a wise and helpful director and an arrogant or ignorant one.\nYet board assessors think nothing of reducing their impressions to numbers on a scale which, after statistical analysis — that is of necessity blind to the peculiarities of the context it is assessing — get treated as fact. This represents another reason why so little improvement in the quality of decision making, organisational culture or market success has resulted from board assessment.\nDespite the much-vaunted advances in technology and the tightening and more sophisticated rules of corporate governance, board assessments — reflection, conversation, exercising conscience and the good judgment that this enables — will help restore leadership and improve business practice.\nThe resultant ability to exercise insight in a way that is useful for businesses is a skill that requires years of experience and cognitive, language and political skills. This, and the capacity to prevail and rebound through conflict and negotiate an outcome, is acquired through experience and it takes a long time to deal with all those competing imperatives.\nThese attributes are central to good governance, the process of which can be monitored but cannot be scripted by rules or measured or regulated by either accountants or lawyers. Nevertheless, getting it right is imperative for the good functioning of society, communities and families and to the efficiency of businesses.\n• Yudelowitz is joint managing director at YSA and the author of Smart Leadership", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T11:59:28.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
