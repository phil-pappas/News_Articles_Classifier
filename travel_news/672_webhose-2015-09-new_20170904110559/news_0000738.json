Tears of joy. \nFirst class travel is up there in bucket list land. Chances are most of us will just dream about it. But when I was invited to try it out on the sky’s big boy, a Qantas A380, on a flight back from Los Angeles, I came home with some very bad news. It totally rocks. And here’s why. The new first class lounge in Los Angeles: things that make you go ‘mmmm’ ... Source: \nAs soon as you check in you make your way to the lounge. Not just a any old lounge but the FIRST class lounge, which in itself makes you feel like you have joined the smarty pants society. A glass of champagne and anything you like from the lounge restaurant — one croque monsieur thanks — and it was time to board. Loungin’: and I’m not even on board yet ... Source: \nOnce on board, and yes, there is absolutely NO queue when you are ushered toward the left of the plane. Well, actually even though you board via the front doors, you actually turn right when you’re travelling first on an A380. Small detail. But hey, it’s first class, so who cares? \nOK, so I’m on board. Roomy: the first class ‘suite’ on a Qantas A380. Source: Supplied \nAs soon as I perch myself in my seat (more a suite than a seat) a chilled glass of real deal champagne is gently popped into my hand. It is served, not with a teeny pack of pretzels or peanuts but with two exquisite canapés — a caviar tartlet and a crostini with salsa verde and pickled fennel — all put on a small tray that is above 2J’s magazine holder. A perky champagne and a caviar canape. Cheers. Source: \nOh and you pretty much have your own flight attendant too. \nMy seat is a fully fledged flat bed that rotates so it turns to where your 17-inch TV screen sits, which is just on top of a small extra seat. Or, it can be a foot rest if you are really, really tall. \nFor most first flyers, the extra seat is there in case you would like to invite a neighbour/partner/travelling buddy/husband/whoever over for dinner and a chat. Personally, I’m happy with my own company for the next 14 or so hours. Just in case you DO want to actually talk or eat with someone. You can. Source: Supplied \nMy understated and impeccably mannered flight attendant, Sunita came and made up my bed even before we left. And just after that I strapped myself in with a belt that resembled a car seat — the whole, over-the-shoulder extravaganza. \nAs I was flying from Los Angeles to Sydney — an overnight flight — it was clever for Sunita to make my bed up before I decided to munch on some supper. Saved all the getting up and standing around thing later on. \nMy choice of mushroom soup with sourdough croutons, a Penfolds Shiraz and a tagliatelle bolognese (OK, I was hungry) was simply sensational and with the addition of Pepe Saya butter (he’s a butter artisan from NSW) it made the meal seem even more special and Neil Perry-esque than if I was having it on land. \nI watched one movie, about six brilliant episodes of Emmy-award winning Veep (well, I had just come back from covering the Emmy Awards) and then, without having to count sheep, I blissfully fell asleep. No, this isn’t my date but some totally handsome model booked by Qantas to look really attractive when he sleeps. Source: Supplied \nREASONS TO LOVE FIRST CLASS: \n● There is a serious calm and feeling of luxe in first class. It’s like you are the only king or queen of the world for those precious hours and no matter what you ask for, it’s is quietly and elegantly attended to. \n● A first class seat or pod (there are 15 of them on an A380) takes up about four economy seats so, yes, there is room. Serious room. And as there are no overhead lockers I could have my on-board flight bag within constant reach, which I loved. Token first-class proof: and lovin’ it … Source: \n● Chic, dark grey PJs: Serious first classers zip straight to the bathroom as soon as the charcoal PJs are handed to them for a quick changeover. I, on the other hand, hang onto them and took them home as a my, well, comfy, at-home lounge wear. \n● These are serious seats; they swivel 75 degrees, they lie totally flat, give you a massage and one moment you’re facing the front of the plane and the next you’ve swivelled like you’re on a seat on The Voice . Next, you’ve reclined yourself into a flat bed. Oh, and did I tell you that your made-up bed includes a large cotton pillow, a smaller pillow, a seriously comfy and homey duvet, a woollen blanket and cotton sheet that has been fitted over a sheepskin-covered foam mattress? I felt like I was in a very, VERY comfy baby’s pram. \n● Loved the mobile charger; the “time to destination” counter; the privacy screens; very smart amenity bags with SK-II products, a small mirror and the trusty toothbrush and toothpaste, which I always forget to bring with me. The handset that holds the keys to your next 13 hours of high-flying happiness Source: Supplied \n● I loved spending at least 30 minutes getting to know my first class digs, especially the aforementioned “time to destination” tablet that doubles as your seat adjuster, entertainment controller, light switch, massage boss and flight path. \n● Oh and did I mention that first class peeps are first to get off the plane, which made me feel even more like a rock star than when I first walked on. Brekkie time: freshly made Buttermilk pancakes and raspberries. As you do. Source: \n● After a 6am arrival — and those pancakes (see above!) — I zipped home, unpacked, put the washing on and felt perky enough to come to the office for the day. Now that’s a mega bonus. \nOn a side note — OK, a rather big one — it pays to remember that using your points can get you up the pointy end, if you have paid for a full fare ticket. So, if you are in the business of frequent flying and those points are accumulating, hey, give it a go. \nThe only bad news is, well, there really isn’t any. \nHappy flying! \nHOW TO GET THERE: \nThe Qantas A380 aircraft operates services from Sydney and Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dubai, Sydney to Hong Kong, and Dubai to London with its codeshare partner Emirates. \nMelissa Hoyer was upgraded by Qantas: the staff probably saw how tired she looked as she checked in .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T21:24:32.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
