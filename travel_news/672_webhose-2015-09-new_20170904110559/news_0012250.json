MDC’s Tower Theater Miami will serve as the exclusive venue for all screenings and seminars.\nGEMS will open with director John Crowley’s Brooklyn, a film adapted by Nick Hornby (An Education) from the Colm Toibin bestselling novel starring Oscar nominee for Atonement, Saoirse Ronan. The festival will close with Warner Bros’ highly-anticipated The 33 starring Antonio Banderas, Juliette Binoche, Rodrigo Santoro, Mario Casas and Lou Diamond Phillips.\nThe Festival’s Executive Director & Director of Programming Jaie Laplante states, “Film festivals are dazzling times, when the shiniest lights of the current cinema are collected in one place for a concentrated moment. So it is with this year’s GEMS selection, and I invite film lovers of all types to experience las joyas de la corona of the season.”\nSource:- Miami International Film Festival", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T03:32:21.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
