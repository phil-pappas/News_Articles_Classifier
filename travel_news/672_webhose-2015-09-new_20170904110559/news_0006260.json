Story highlights No one was injured in the mishap \"We would like to apologize for the delay and any inconvenience caused,\" Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman says (CNN) Passengers were removed from a Virgin Atlantic flight in New York on Saturday after a wing clipped a fence. No one was injured on Flight VS26 from John F. Kennedy International Airport to London's Heathrow, according to the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey. The plane hit a blast fence when pushing back from the gate. Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman Lisette Kwong said a \"miscalculation by the tug\" caused the incident. \"All customers have disembarked the aircraft and our teams are working hard to get our customers on their way as soon as possible,\" Kwong said. \"Safety is our number one priority and we would like to apologize for the delay and any inconvenience caused.\" A passenger said the plane \"shuddered\" as it hit the wall. @VirginAtlantic n !!
