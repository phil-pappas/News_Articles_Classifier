Thomas A. Dickerson | Sep 10, 2015 Hon. Thomas A. Dickerson eTN   \nThis is our third article on the imposition by local United States taxing authorities [cities and counties] of retail sales taxes upon online travel companies [OTCs]. [see Taxes on online travel companies in Hawaii, eturbonews.com (5/14/2015) and Taxes on online travel companies: The fight against government (Florida), eturbonews.com (7/9/2015)]. In this article we discuss a recent decision by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Expedia, Inc. v. District of Columbia, CAB-2117-11 (Decided July 23, 2015)(the D.C. Tax Case). As noted in Tillman, Online Travel Companies Must Pay Sales Tax, D.C. Appeals Court Rules, law.com (7/23/2015) “Online travel companies such as Expedia and Travelocity are on the hook for more than $60 million in back sales taxes (for the period 1998 through 2011)”. \nAt issue in each of the tax cases we have discussed [Hawaii and Florida] and will discuss [District of Columbia] is whether local tax statutes permit cities or counties to “tax the difference between the actual cost of the room, which the hotel receives, and the higher rate the travel companies charge the customer in order to make a profit [“the profit differential”]. As noted in our prior articles Hawaii permits the taxation of the OTC’s profit differential while Florida does not. Now the District of Columbia has weighed in and has joined Hawaii. \nTravel Law Update \nUber Driver Class Action Certified \nIn O’Connor v. Uber Technologies, Inc., No. C-13-3826 EMC, Decision dated September 1, 2015, Judge Edward M. Chen of the United States District Court of Northern California granted class certification to a class of approximately 160,000 “UberBlack, UberX and UberSUV drivers who have driven for Uber in the state of California at any time since August 16, 2009...Plaintiffs contend that they and all 160,000 putative class members are Uber’s employees, as opposed to its independent contractors, and thus eligible for various protections codified for employees in the California Labor Code. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Uber has uniformly failed to reimburse its drivers ‘for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties’ in violation of California Labor Code section 2802, and uniformly failed to pass on the entire amount of any tip or gratuity ‘that is paid, given to, or left for an employee for a patron’. Cal. Lab. Code Section 351\" [see also O’Connor v. Uber Techs., Inc., 2015 WL 1069092 (N.D. Cal. 2015)]. \nParis Tax Collector \nIn Corso, Airbnb To Collect Tourism Tax From Paris Visitors, law360.com (8/25/2015) it was noted that “A recent change in French tax policy...has made it easier for home-sharing sites like Airbnb to collect tourism taxes directly, the company says. It told tourists booking rooms in Paris that they could soon expect to see a charge of E0.83 ($0.95) per day added directly to their bill. The company also announced that it has plans to expand the new tax collection procedures throughout other cities in France”. \nTaxi Of Tomorrow Arrives \nIn Fitzsimmons, Tomorrow Arrives for New York City Yellow Cab Standard, nytimes.com (August 31, 2015) it was noted that “The boxy yellow vehicle is a survivor. It won a competition to redesign New York City’s taxi. It endured a pothole-marred course in Arizona meant to replicate the city’s rugged streets. And it prevailed in a legal battle and overcame the election of a new mayor who had been a vocal opponent. On Tuesday, the vehicle, known as the Taxi of Tomorrow, finally becomes the city’s yellow cab standard. The Nissan NV 200, more minivan than muscle car, is a major make over for the city taxi, which evolved with memorable (the Checker) and not-so-memorable (the Crown Victoria) incarnations” [see our earlier article Taxi of Tomorrow has finally arrived: But is it too late, eturbonews.com (7/30/2015)]. \nHotels Fight Back \nIn Kessler & Weed, Hotels Fight Back Against Sites Like Expedia and Priceline, nytimes.com (August 31, 2015) it was noted “For years, travelers have been drawn to online sites like Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz and Priceline to find and reserve hotel rooms, flights and rental cars. Hotels welcomed the system...even though the business came at the cost of substantial commissions. But now they are fighting back. With the online giants consolidating and potentially tightening their hold on travel bookings, major hotel chains are offering a host of benefits to lure travelers to book with them directly: digital check-in, free meals, Wi-Fi and even the ability to choose a specific room. At the same time, the industry has been outspoken with regulators this year in an attempt to block a merger of two of the largest online booking companies, Expedia and Orbitz. The financial stakes are high. Cutting out the intermediary not only saves on commissions, but also puts the hotel chains in direct communication with their guests. That translates to building profiles of preferences and spending habits to help attract guests on future trips” [for a discussion of the relationship between Hawaiian hotels and OTCS see my earlier article Best Price or Lowest Price guarantees: What do these words mean?, eturbonews.com (12/19/2014)]. \nReservations About Expedia Acquisition \nIn Reisinger, Some Reservations About Expedia’s Acquisition of Orbitz, corcounsel.com (8/13/2015) it was noted that “A consumer activist group and the hotel industry are both urging the U.S. Department of Justice to block travel-booking site Expedia Inc.’s proposed acquisition of Orbitz Worldwide, Inc... John Simpson, privacy project director of Consumer Watchdog wrote a letter this week to the DOJ, urging it to block the $1.3 billion deal...Simpson wrote, ‘The proposed deal would give the combined company monopolistic control of the online booking market, enabling it to impose higher fees on hotels, which would inevitably mean higher costs for consumers’...On Aug. 6, Katherine Luger, president and CEO of the (American Hotel & Lodging Association), issued a statement opposing the deal, citing ‘significant negative consequences’. ‘Hotels currently pay Expedia an average 11 percent higher commissions than they pay Orbitz’, Luger said. ‘The acquisition could result in Orbitz raising its rates to that level. ...Should this acquisition go forward as proposed, it will result in a duopoly with over 95 percent of the online travel agency bookings in the United States being controlled by two competitors, Expedia and Priceline [The Priceline Group]. She concluded, ‘We look forward to the results of the (DOJ’s) careful review of this proposed acquisition’”. \nAir Crash In Indonesia \nIn Cochrane, Indonesian Plane Carrying 54 Is Declared Missing in Papua, nytimes.com (8/16/2015) it was noted that “Rescue teams were searching Monday for the wreckage of an Indonesian commercial aircraft carrying 54 people that was believed to have crashed on Sunday amid inclement weather in the eastern region of Papua...Trigana Air Service (operated the aircraft and) has had 14 crashes-three of them resulting in fatalities-since it began operations in 1991, including a crash in 2006, also in Papua Province, that killed all 12 passengers and crew aboard, according to the Aviation Safety Network”. \nUber & Lyft Riders With Disabilities \nIn Rodriquez, For Uber, Lyft Riders With Disabilities, Discrimination Often Comes Included, ibtimes.com (8/13/2015) it was noted that “Throughout the country Uber and Lyft customers report problems with accommodations for guide dogs and wheelchairs. In the worst cases, they describe their experiences as feeling humiliation, harassment and discrimination. These types of incidents have led to a series of lawsuits ( http://time.com/3895021/why-the-disabled-are-suing-uber-and-lyft/ ) against both Uber and Lyft that accuse the companies of violating or failing to uphold the Americans with Disabilities Act...Both Uber and Lyft have policies in place that prohibit drivers from denying service to customers with disabilities... Additionally, both companies have also begun to take steps to provide rides designed specifically for customers with disabilities...Many disabled customers agree that Uber and Lyft have made getting around easier than was previously possible. For blind passengers, for example, hailing a ride is much easier than before, and because all payments are handled via an app, these customers don’t have to worry that a driver might overcharge them”. \nSharing Economy Linguistics \nIn Singer, Twisting Words to Make ‘Sharing’ Apps Seem Selfless, nytimes.com (8/8/2015) it was noted that “I have trouble with the sharing economy...To be clear, I’m not objecting to the services themselves. Ride-hailing apps like Lyft and Uber...vacation rental sites like Airbnb...have clearly made travel, lodging...more efficient for millions of people. What I find problematic is the terminology itself and how it frames technology-enabled transactions as if they were altruistic or community endeavors. Let’s begin with ‘sharing’, a concept that implies something selfless-like giving a part of your liver to a relative who needs a transplant”. \n“Now, at least in industry parlance, the word has also come to denote just about any online venture that connects consumers seeking goods and services with people willing to provide them. That would include apps that charge a fee to stay in strangers’ spare bedrooms or use their cars-ventures formerly known as ‘renting’. Lyft and Uber, for instance, have both described their services as ‘ride-sharing’ whether the ride involves one or multiple passengers. Lyft also promotes itself as ‘your friend with a car’. Uber calls its drivers ‘partners’ and ‘entrepreneurs’. Of Airbnb’s lodging rentals, its site says, ‘trust is what makes it work’...” \n“Of course, marketing by its very nature involves concocting the most appealing expressions to attract consumers. But start-ups that enable consumers to summon drivers...at the tap of an app have added incentives to portray themselves in feel-good terms. Government regulators, legislators and courts in the United States have started scrutinizing the app-mediated service sector with the idea of determining whether longstanding consumer protection and labor rules apply to these new delivery models ...Altruistic words may also lend an aura of incontestability to app-enabled transactions. After all, who wants to challenge services that invoke generous concepts like sharing?” \nTravel Law Article: Taxing OTCs Again \nThe D.C. Sales Tax \nAs noted by the Court in the D.C. Tax Case “In the District of Columbia, sales tax is governed by D.C. Code Sections 47-2001 to 47-2027. That statute imposes tax on ‘vendor’ for exercising the privilege of ‘selling at retail certain tangible personal property’ as well as ‘selling certain selected services’...The \ndefinition of ‘retail sale’ lists the services that are subject to sales tax...This case involves the contours of one of the statute’s enumerated services, ‘the sale or charge for any room...furnished to transients by any hotel’...Specifically, the District of Columbia and (OTCs) read the statute differently as applied to the retail margins the OTCs earn when they facilitate transactions between customers and hotels in the District of Columbia. \nReasonable Opposing Positions \n“The District argues that the OTCs are ‘vendors’ liable for sales tax, and seeks to collect tax on the gross receipts of the entire transaction that occurs between the OTC and its customers. The OTCs argue that the only taxable transaction under the statute is the one that occurs between the customer and the hotel-one in which the OTC participates only indirectly-and therefore sales tax is not due on the retail margins the OTC retains for itself. The matter is ultimately one of statutory construction. The statute is not entirely clear and both sides read it in a reasonable manner”. \nThe Merchant Model \n“OTCs operate websites that allow customers to search for, compare, book and pay for travel reservations. In that respect, the OTCs serve as intermediaries between customers and a host of travel service providers, including car rental companies, airlines and-importantly for this appeal, hotels. The OTCs’ primary business model for the sale of hotel rooms is known as the merchant model: a uniform, nationwide model that operates the same way, in all relevant respects, for all OTCs and in all jurisdictions...The OTCs have been using the merchant model to book hotel stays in the District since at least the late 1990s”. \nHow It Works \n“Under the merchant model, the OTCs contract with hotels for the right to sell hotel rooms to online customers at a ‘retail rate’ while paying the hotels that actually furnish the rooms (At) some lower, negotiated ‘net rate’. In a typical merchant model transaction, a customer uses an OTC’s website to search for and select a hotel room. The customer enters her payment information directly into the OTC’s website, the OTC forwards the reservation request to the hotel, and the hotel determines whether to accept the request based on factors like availability. \nThe OTC must communicate with the hotel before confirming because the hotel retains the ability to change room rates and availability, even seconds after such information is displayed to a customer on an OTC website...If the hotel accepts the booking, it sends a confirmation number to the OTC, which then charges the customer’s credit card and forwards that confirmation number to the customer. No money changes hands directly between the customer and hotel, unless the customer chooses to purchase incidental items like room service and valet parking”. \nThe Tax Recovery Charge \n“When charging the customer’s credit card, the OTC collects an amount that consists of the net room rate that it will later forward to the hotel, a tax recovery charge and a retail margin that the OTC keeps as profit. The tax recovery charge-which represents the sales tax due on the net rate received by the hotel-is also forwarded to the hotel, which then remits it to the District. The District thus receives the sales tax due on the net rate paid to the hotel, but does not receive sales tax on the OTCs’ retail margins-that is, on the difference between (1) the total charges that the customer pays to the OTC and (2) the lower, net rate that the OTC forwards to the hotel. When it charges the customer, the OTC does not isolate the ‘sales tax’ as a separate amount, but instead calls the sales tax a ‘tax recovery charge’ which it combines with a ‘service fee’. As a result, the customer does not know how much sales tax has been paid on the transaction”. \nThe Sales Tax Law \n“[T]he District of Columbia imposes sales tax upon all ‘vendors’ for ‘the privilege of selling at retail certain tangible personal property and for the privilege of selling certain selected services’...Thus, a ‘sale’ is either transferring possession of property, or rendering a taxable service, for consideration...The total tax rate imposed on the ‘sale of or charges for any [hotel] rooms’ is 14.5% of the ‘gross receipts’ ...Gross receipts are defined as ‘the total amount of sales prices of the retail sales of vendors’...The statute defines ‘sales price’ as ‘the total amount paid by a purchaser to a vendor as consideration for a retail sale’...and clarifies that the sales price includes ‘[a]ny services that are a part of the sale’”. \nRecent Amendments To Sales Tax Law \n“Since the District filed this lawsuit...the District sales tax statute has been amended several times. The D.C. Council inserted mention of ‘net charges and additional charges’ as well as ‘room remarketer’ into the definition of the taxable service...The statute goes on to define ‘room remarketer’ as ‘[A]ny person, other than the operator of a hotel...having any right...through an internet transaction...to offer...or facilitate the transfer of rooms the occupancy of which is subject to tax under this chapter...the tax imposed...shall be determined based on the net charges...received by the room remarketer”. \nConclusion \n“Not only do the structure and purpose of the District’s sales tax law evince Congress’s intent to tax the full amount that customers pay for hotel rooms in the District of Columbia, but the legislative history confirms this result. Congress aimed to tax the amount that the purchaser pays for the enumerated services, and-in targeting the sale-sought to include ancillary or intermediary transactions. While Congress in the year 1949 did not contemplate online travel companies matching customers with hotels using sophisticated information technology, it know what a middleman was and did address the issue. We draw the same conclusion as the trial court, which reasoned: The structure of the statute is clear...The legislative history further supports that transactions where one party purchases an item and sells it virtually unchanged to the final purchaser, are taxable...This lends support to the Court’s holding that...it is the...sale to the ultimate purchaser [that is taxable...]”. \nThe author, Justice Dickerson, has been writing about Travel Law for 39 years including his annually updated law books, Travel Law, Law Journal Press (2015) and Litigating International Torts in U.S. Courts, Thomson Reuters WestLaw (2015), and over 350 legal articles.
