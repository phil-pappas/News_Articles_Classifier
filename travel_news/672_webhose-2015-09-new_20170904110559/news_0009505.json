It looks at how the transit system prepared for and responded to such disasters as the blizzard of 2010 and the blackout of 2003, when transit workers evacuated subway riders to safety. The show uses photographs, oral histories, artifacts and multimedia displays to tell the story. The exhibit grew out of the museum's own response to Sandy and stories of transit workers using their skills to bring the city back. ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T01:49:13.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
