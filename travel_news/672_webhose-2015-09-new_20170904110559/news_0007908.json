Rubenstein, Co-Founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer of The Carlyle Group, a global alternative asset manager; Tony Robbins, best-selling author, entrepreneur, philanthropist and world-renowned life-and-business strategist; Omar Johnson, Chief Marketing Officer at Beats Electronics, a leading entertainment brand founded in 2006 and now a division of Apple; and Elliot Weissbluth, Chief Executive Officer of HighTower, an industry-leading financial services firm that blends objective, independent wealth management advice with innovative technology.\n“Our speakers are accomplished executives and business leaders who have not only built successful enterprises, but also significantly transformed their respective industries,” said Worth Group Editor in Chief and Chief Content Officer Richard Bradley. “We are honored that they have agreed to share their advice and insights in an intimate and interactive forum with members of the Worth Group community at our 4th annual Power 100 Summit.”\nHeld four times per year, Worth Summits are among the premier educational, networking and social events in the global finance industry. Invitations to Worth Summits are extended to members of the Worth Leading Wealth Advisors Program, which is an innovative marketing platform that provides Worth magazine readers with valuable insight from accomplished practitioners in the fields of investment management, insurance, accounting and law. Advisors in these fields constitute a significant portion of Worth magazine’s readership, and those who participate in the Leading Wealth Advisors Program are highlighted on Worth Group’s digital and print platforms and contribute to the company’s revenue base.\nA highlight of the 2015 Power 100 Summit will be the unveiling of the annual Worth Power 100 list, the authoritative ranking of the most powerful people in global finance. Three of the four speakers—David M. Rubenstein, Tony Robbins and Elliot Weissbluth—have been named as members of the upcoming 2015 Worth Power 100.\n“This is an exciting time to work in the financial services industry,” Weissbluth said. “I am proud of what we are doing to disrupt the status quo and could not be more honored to be included among this group of dynamic thinkers and leaders.”\nFollowing the success of his No. 1 New York Times bestselling book: “Money Master the Game—7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom,” Tony Robbins has become one of the most visible advocates for financial reform, pressing for tougher fiduciary standards on 401(k) accounts and other measures to safeguard investor savings.\n“I look forward to speaking at the Worth Power 100 Summit,” Robbins said. “It’s a great honor to be named one of Worth’s most powerful people in global finance, and I’m thankful to have another opportunity to share the insights that I’ve gleaned through my work with some of the most successful figures in the financial industry.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T18:14:27.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
