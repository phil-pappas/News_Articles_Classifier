Contrary to what some people may think, Sydney isn’t the capital. So many people think it is (Australians too, shameful) — but it gets all the credit of being a capital without having the responsibility. I'm such a geek... Every time someone in WTM tweets something with my name (aka the capital of Australia) in it, I feel all giddy  — Sydney Samery (@SydSamery) September 13, 2015 \n8. It hosted the best Olympics in Australia ... ever \nWho can remember anything about Melbourne’s hosting of the Games? OK, it’s understandable that they were hosted in 1956.
