PUBLISHED: 21:51, Thu, Sep 10, 2015 | UPDATED: 21:58, Thu, Sep 10, 2015 PH As well as facials and massages, a wide range of unique treatments is also on offer FACILITIES \nThankfully we were able to find our own way for the last few miles and pulled up at the family-run hotel to be greeted with a very warm welcome. \nWe stayed in one of the new garden rooms, which come equipped with a four-poster bed and outside cedar hot tub for added luxury. \nHowever it’s the Mill Wheel Spa that really sets this cosy hotel apart. As well as facials and massages, a wide range of unique treatments is also on offer. \nGuests can try the Beach Hut, a 25-minute treatment where you lie down on a bed of warm sand while a heat lamp mimics the sun’s movements from rising to setting. TREATMENTS AVAILABLE \nFacials, steam massages, pregnancy treatments, foot soaks and waxing. TREATMENTS TESTED \nHeaven Mini Facial, £30, 30 minutes Facialist Deborah Mitchell has long been an A-list favourite and counts Dannii Minogue, Victoria Beckham and Claudia Schiffer as clients. \nHer organic range of products, Heaven, took 10 years to perfect and is now used in the spa. \nAfter cleansing and toning my skin, my therapist massaged in a range of hydrating serums and creams which left my skin plump and glowing. \nRasul, £40 per couple, 25 minutes This is the perfect way to introduce the spa-shy such as my reluctant boyfriend Alastair to the wonders of mud masks. \nSitting opposite each other in a private room, we coated our skin in three different kinds of mineral-rich mud. \nAs steam heated the room, we sat back and relaxed. \nJust as the heat started to become too much, an automatic shower switched on overhead and the mud was washed away leaving soft, cleansed skin. GOOD POINTS \nThe food in The Stables restaurant is delicious. We tucked into crispy scallops and tender fillet of Staffordshire beef with triple-cooked chips. WHAT IT COSTS \nThe Serenity Spa Break, from £160 per person (Monday to Saturday) includes one night B&B in a superior style room, three-course dinner in The Stables, full use of spa facilities, a Beach Hut treatment plus one other 55-minute treatment.
