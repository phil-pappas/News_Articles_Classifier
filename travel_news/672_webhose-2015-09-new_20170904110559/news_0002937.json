ENDED UP W/4 DISHES!!!! YAA . THANK YO . LOVE, JACQUES.” And throughout our exchange, chef La Merde—whose true identity is a closely guarded secret—never once broke character. In the last year, the anonymous Instagram handle @chefjacqueslamerde has amassed almost 100,000 followers, thanks to the chef’s stunning pictures of dishes that, at first glance, seem to be carefully crafted New Nordic or molecular gastronomy creations, but are revealed in his captions to be made from a hilarious array of junk food like Doritos, Hot Pockets, Velveeta, and Slim Jims. Chef La Merde works alone on his own food, according to his manager (whom I suspect all along might just be the man in question), but seems to have a gig cooking in an unknown restaurant according to a few of his early captions; has recently scored partnerships with companies like Mountain Dew; and makes online videos with sites like Eater .\nA huge part of the fascination surrounding La Merde and who he might be is his incredible plating ability. He uses tweezers to compose his dishes, but also often uses hilarious hashtags alongside the gorgeous creations that say things like #soignéisajourney #notadestination. His smart shtick is a cheeky commentary on the seriousness of many chefs today, and perhaps foodie culture in general. And with that crowd mourning the recent news of René Redzepi ’s Michelin-starred mecca, Noma, closing its doors next year for renovation, La Merde prepared, exclusively for Vogue.com, his own versions of four of the most famous Noma dishes. Below, the anonymous online star’s very hilarious, delightful-looking, and unedited nod to Noma.\nRené Redzepi: Tartar of beef and wood sorrel, tarragon, and juniper\nJacques La Merde: Tartar of Vienna beef, clover, marigolds, Doritos, and French’s mustard\n“HOW DO U CREATE A TRIBUTE FOR RENÉ REDZEPI? BROS, THAT’S LIKE ASKING BASQUIAT TO WRITE A THANK U NOTE TO PICASSO!!!! HOW DO I CREATE SOMETHING WORTHY OF THE MAN WHOSE DEWY COMPLEXION AND DRIVEN, AUSTERE GAZE I LONG TO POSSESS?!!! HOW DO I DEAL W/ MY BEARD ENVY?!! RENÉ CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF COOKING . . . MOSTLY BY ADDING . . . BITS OF LANDSCAPE!!!! SUDDENLY WE ALL REALIZED THAT TIME AND PLACE WERE MORE THAN JUST EMOTIONS, THEY WERE FLAVORS!!!! I LOVE RENÉ’S TARTAR BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO THE SCANDANAVIAN TERROIR AND THE THINGS THAT GROW AND THRIVE THERE. WHEN I DID MY OWN PLAY ON IT, I CHOSE TO USE INGREDIENTS THAT TRULY REPRESENT WHERE I COME FROM AND, ULTIMATELY, WHERE I AM GOING.”\nRedzepi: Vegetable Field\nLa Merde: Enchanted Cheetos Forest “RENÉ TAUGHT ME ABOUT NEGATIVE SPACE. HE ALSO TAUGHT ME ABOUT POSITIVE SPACE. IN THIS CASE, THE POSITIVE SPACE IS ACTUALLY A ROCK I ‘BORROWED’ FROM THE ‘LAWN’ OF SOME SUBSIDIZED HOUSING NEXT TO MY APARTMENT. I CHOSE TO REINTERPRET HIS BUCOLIC CULINARY ALLEGORY OF A FECUND AND WELL-TENDED GARDEN W/ CHEETOS EMBEDDED IN RANCH AND COVERED IN SOME SPRUCE TIPS, HICKORY STICKS, AND GOYA-INFUSED MARBLE-RYE SOIL. I DID THIS B/C I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO VISIT A FOREST MADE OF CHEETOS.”\nRedzepi: Yogurt and whey, peas and celery\nLa Merde: Velveeta and bits of plant, peas, and celery\n“DID ANYONE KNO WUT TWEEZERS WERE BEFORE NOMA? SHORT ANSWER IS N . THIS GUY SHOWED US ALL THAT THINLY SLICED PRODUCE IS GOOD, BUT THINLY SLICED PRODUCE CUT INTO THE SHAPE OF A CIRCLE IS SOIGNÉ. HE MADE ME BELIEVE IN GREEN STRAWBERRIES AND PICKLED HERRING, AND NOW I KNOW THAT A SMALL ONION SEPARATED INTO PETALS IS NEXT LEVEL, BUT AN EVEN SMALLER ONION PETAL TWEEZERED INTO A LARGER ONION PETAL IS UPPER NEXT LEVEL. MOST OF ALL, HE TAUGHT US THAT A BEAUTIFUL PLATE IS THE GREATEST FLAVOR OF ALL.”\nRedzepi: Ants and cabbage with crème fraîche and some other stuff\nLa Merde: Wedge salad with fruit flies\n“THIS DISH IS MY LOVE LETTER TO RENÉ, WHO INSPIRED ME TO TAKE A RISK AND CREATE A SNOW GLOBE OF FLAVORS IN A WRINKLE IN TIME!!!! RENÉ BLEW ALL OUR MINDS WHEN HE CELEBRATED THE HEIGHT OF SUMMER W/ LEMONGRASSY ANTS ON RICH CRÈME FRAÎCHE AND CRISPY CABBAGE LEAVES. I WANTED TO CAPTURE THE BITTERSWEET FEELINGS OF THE END OF THE SUMMER, SO I WILD-HARVESTED THE LAST OF THE FRUIT FLIES NEAR THE DISH PIT AND COMBINED IT W/ LUSCIOUS DAISY SOUR CREAM ON A PILLOW OF ICEBERG. THIS PERFECT BITE IS PAIRED W/ SLOW-FERMENTED ROSEHIPS FROM THE ROSA RUGOSA DOWN THE ROAD AND TYPICAL WEDGE SALAD ACCOUTREMENTS LIKE SIMULTATED BACON BITS, CRUMBLED BLEU CHEESE, RED RADISH, AND GREEN ONION ROOTS!!!\n“U KNO WUT THEY SAY, BROS!!! UR NOT RLLY COOKING TIL U SERVE SOMEONE BUGS!!!!”", "external_links": ["http://www.eater.com/2015/8/24/9197745/jacques-le-merde-60-second-tasting-menu-video", "https://instagram.com/chefjacqueslamerde/?hl=en", "https://instagram.com/chefjacqueslamerde/"], "published": "2015-09-29T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:04:30.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
