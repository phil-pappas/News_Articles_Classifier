The one-way PFD fares are valid for travel within and to/from Alaska starting Oct. 13, 2015, through May 24, 2016. For the first time this year, Alaska Airlines is also offering members of its Club 49 program an extra 1,000 bonus miles for each roundtrip flown during the seven month travel window.\n \n \n“Alaska Airlines’ PFD sale offers our loyal customers some of our best fares of the year with a longer travel window than any other sale,” said Marilyn Romano, the airline’s regional vice president for the state of Alaska. “This is a great time to ask yourself ‘Where Do You Want to Be?’ this winter and spring and plan your families’ vacations.”Alaska residents can save even more by joining the Club 49 program. Perks include free checked bags, Travel Now discounts and weekly fare sales.\n \nLast year, Alaskans saved over $18 million by utilizing their Club 49 benefits. The program was started in 2011 as a way to honor Alaska Airlines’ history in the state and to help meet residents’ travel needs. Club 49 is only available to Alaska residents and requires enrollment in Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan™. Customers may also combine sale fares to save on Alaska Airlines Vacations packages, which include air transportation, hotel accommodations, optional ground transportation and tours.\n \n \nSource:- Alaska Airlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T18:26:29.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
