She was not expecting traffic to resume before 4 p.m.\nWSDOT blames the incident on three factors Wednesday morning:\n • One anchor cable, which secures the deck to the canal bottom, is disconnected for a cable-replacement project, and the new one hasn’t been fastened yet.\n• The bridge tender opened the drawspan, as required by federal navigation rules, to let a vessel pass through.\n• Tides were quickly rising , en route to a roughly 11-foot increase from dawn to afternoon. Moving water pushed against the central, floating segments of the bridge.\nThe span is part of Highway 104 between Kingston and the Olympic Peninsula, where drivers are being detoured.\n“It was an unusual set of circumstances,” Baker said, asked if WSDOT should have anticipated the bridge would misalign.\nWSDOT may ask mariners to avoid requesting a drawspan opening, except during slack tide conditions, Baker said. The risk of another misalignment should end within a couple days, when the replacement cable is secured, she said.\nMike Lindblom: 206-515-5631 or mlindblom@seattletimes.com .
