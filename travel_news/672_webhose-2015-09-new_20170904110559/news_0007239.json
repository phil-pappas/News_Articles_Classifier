Hyatt Regency Lake Washington at Seattle’s Southport is currently under construction and is expected to open in 2017.\n“We are proud to announce that we are bringing the Hyatt Regency brand to Southport. Hyatt Regency Lake Washington at Seattle’s Southport is a hotel experience being designed to cultivate connections and offer memorable dining experiences, stimulating recreational facilities, and inspirational meeting services,” stated Michael Christ, CEO, SECO Development Inc. “We are delighted to be working with Hyatt and contributing to the economic vitality of the area with this new hotel.”\nThe 12-story Hyatt Regency Lake Washington at Seattle’s Southport is situated on a 5.5-acre lakefront site on Lake Washington. Capturing the beauty of the Puget Sound region, the hotel’s design will offer panoramic views of Downtown Seattle, the Olympic Mountains, Mt. Rainier, and Lake Washington. Another design feature that is part of the destination’s story is the hotel’s 12-floor design, in honor of the Seattle Seahawk’s 12th Man, the 12s, which is the given name for the team’s loyal fans.\n“The City of Renton strongly supports the development of a waterfront hotel. Once constructed, this Hyatt Regency hotel will serve as a critical catalyst for the emerging South Lake Washington neighborhood. This new development will have a positive impact on our region’s employment base as well as demand for business services, tourism, and convention business,” said City of Renton Mayor Denis Law.\nEach of the hotel’s 347 rooms, including 31 suites, will be smartly configured to enhance work or play with seamless connectivity. The planned terrace gardens, glass art wall structures, and prominent local art will enhance the guests’ connection with the surrounding Pacific Northwest region. Hotel guests will also have direct access to Lake Washington and the adjacent 57-acre Gene Coulon Memorial Beach Park, which features nature trails and numerous other recreational activities.\nGuests will find culinary experiences worth sharing anytime and anywhere with dining options that will include a waterfront restaurant and bar with an outdoor dining terrace as well as private dining rooms.

A residentially inspired display kitchen will be integrated directly within the guest event area. For events al fresco, planners and guests can take their meetings outside to the hotel’s expansive outdoor, Northwest garden-landscaped event terraces of up to 12,000 square feet that overlook Lake Washington. Event facilities also include private salons and lounges, ideal for weddings and other special events. Among the space features are changing facilities, full length mirrors, fully stocked vanities, and restrooms.\n“Hyatt Regency Lake Washington at Seattle’s Southport represents an outstanding opportunity to further Hyatt’s presence in the Pacific Northwest. We are excited to be a part of the Southport development project with the very accomplished team of SECO Development,” stated David Tarr, senior vice president, real estate and development for Hyatt. “We believe that the globally recognized Hyatt Regency brand will resonate with the growing base of business and leisure travelers to the City of Renton, and we look forward to giving them an outstanding new lodging option in the area.”\nHyatt Regency Lake Washington at Seattle’s Southport is envisioned to be the premier hotel on Lake Washington, part of a mixed use Southport development, which will also include luxury apartments, three office towers, and retail space. Keeping guests conveniently connected to the places important to them, the hotel will be located 9 miles northeast of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, 11 miles south of Downtown Seattle, and 7 miles south of Bellevue.
