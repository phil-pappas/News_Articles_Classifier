Fairmont Hotels & Resorts F-scapes adventure travel packages Fairmont Hotels & Resorts F-scapes adventure travel packages Fairmont Hotels & Resorts F-scapes adventure travel packages Fairmont Hotels & Resorts F-scapes adventure travel packages Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Rebekah Bell September 4, 2015 \nAlthough autumn is right around the corner, there is still ample time to savor the last of summer with one of the Fairmont Hotels & Resorts F-scapes adventure travel packages . These 42 carefully curated excursions can be booked until the end of September, giving families just enough time to plan a memorable getaway before school kicks into high gear. With destinations in Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, Barbados, and the United States, the excursions offer everything from classic road trips to island getaways. Here are some of the F-Scape packages that caught our attention. \nThe Fairmont Orchid, a resort on the Big Island of Hawaii built amidst waterfalls and lush vegetation, is the ideal destination for those seeking a tropical vacation. During the Cultural & Canoeing in Kohala expedition (from $352 per night, based on double occupancy), guests can revel in the splendor of sparkling turquoise waters and sandy white beaches as they embark on an outrigger canoe adventure led by an experienced beach guide. After a day spent swimming, sunbathing, or exploring, guests can retreat to serene rooms offering picturesque ocean views. \nThe Capture the Rainforest: F-scape to Whistler expedition (which takes place in British Columbia’s coastal rainforest), includes a guide-led hike to the famed 1,000-year-old Ancient Cedars, a gourmet picnic, and a zip-line tour. After having professional photos taken against a backdrop of beautiful scenery, guests can retire in the Fairmont Chateau Whistler (from $633 per night, based on double occupancy). \nFor those seeking a cross-country trek, Fairmont has teamed up with Cadillac to offer unique road-trip packages. For example, the Golden State of Mind: F-scape Road Trip to Northern California (orchestrated by the Fairmont San Francisco and the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa) includes a tour of San Francisco, a picturesque drive to Sonoma, an exclusive spa treatment, and a VIP Tour and Tasting experience at Flanagan Wines. Starting at $3,717 for a three-night stay, based on double occupancy, the trip allows guests to appreciate the Golden State’s beauty. \nGuests who would prefer to traverse the East Coast can choose the Captivating Capital: F-scape Road Trip to Maryland & Virginia, which offers an overview of everything from Annapolis, Maryland—home to some of America’s founding fathers—to the Chesapeake Bay. After soaking in the rich culture and history of the area, guests can return to rooms at Fairmont Washington, D.C., Georgetown (from $689 per night, based on double occupancy.) \nThe third and final road trip, which is hosted by the Fairmont Copley Plaza, Boston (from $824 per night, based on double occupancy; two-night minimum stay), offers an overview of New England. From a tour of Louisa May Alcott’s childhood home to a trek amidst the clam shacks and fishing villages that comprise Cape Ann, guests will appreciate the untarnished coastal beauty of the region.
