Here's a look at what's coming up... Modern Family Catch seasons 1 to 6 with Sky Box Sets before the new season arrives on Sky TV Photo: MODERN FAMILY © 2009-2015 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. All rights reserved. Artwork: © 2009-2015 American Broadcasting Companies. All rights reserved. Series 1–6 One of only two series to have won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series five times, Modern Family returns with the children all grown up: eldest daughter Haley Dunphy is now an adult compared to the surly teenager in the pilot episode, while her youngest brother, Luke, has developed an inept criminal streak. Meanwhile stepbrother Manny Delgado, who was just 10 at the start of this long-running comedy, is now driving. But the biggest changes are with the adults: comedy highpoints promised in this season include family head (and clown-phobic) Phil Dunphy dressed as a clown and trapped in a hall of mirrors, while his gay brother, Mitchell, takes it on himself to coach an American football team while knowing nothing about the sport. It is down to his football-loving husband to coach via an earpiece and binoculars while hiding in bushes. The Flash Catch the first season with Sky Box Sets before the new season arrives on Sky TV Photo: The Flash ©2015 Warner Bros Entertainment Inc. Hugo award-nominated The Flash is speeding your way for a second series. The Flash takes its DC Comics past very seriously, and keeps the shows full of references to the original comics while trying to keep things fresh. Season two of the show sees The Flash introduce Jay Garrick, the older Flash from the Forties, who arrives in present-day Central City to warn our Flash, Barry Allen, of an impending danger that he alone cannot hope to stop. Plus we have a new villain in this series, Flash nemesis Zoom, voiced by Tony Todd. Executive producer Andrew Kreisberg says that Todd will only be voicing Zoom, a masked supervillain. “We wanted to do something like James Earl Jones as Darth Vader – this iconic voice coming out of this mask,” Kreisberg told Variety . The Walking Dead Catch seasons 1 to 5 with Sky Box Sets before the new season arrives on Sky TV Photo: The Walking Dead © Gene Page/AMC The season premiere of the fifth series of The Walking Dead was the highest-rated show in American cable TV history. More than 17 million viewers tuned in to watch how deputy sheriff Rick Grimes continues his quest for home in a world literally crawling with flesh-eating zombies. Scott Gimple, the creative boss of The Walking Dead , is playing his cards close to his chest as to what’s coming up this season: all he will say is that the first half of the sixth series will go deeper into the backstory of The Walking Dead universe, which serves almost like a prequel to the second half taken directly from Robert Kirkman’s cult graphic novel. The Knick Catch the first season with Sky Box Sets before the new season arrives on Sky TV Photo: The Knick ©2015 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc. This look at a turn-of-the-century hospital in New York City is back for a second series, and picks up straight where season one left off. Director Steven Soderbergh has been praised for the bloody, visceral feel of The Knick , with its operating theatre awash with blood. This second season gets even wilder, according to Clive Owen, who stars as the brilliant and mercurial chief surgeon Dr Thackery. “There’s so much more in the second season, too, that you’re just shocked by… it’s a very bold piece of television. It goes much more outside of the hospital and gives you a big palette of New York at this time. It’s wild and brave… we’ve taken the people quite far enough in that first season to be able to just pick it up and push it further.” The Leftovers Catch the first season with Sky Box Sets before the new season arrives on Sky TV Photo: The Leftovers ©2015 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc. The second season of this cult show has undergone a creative reboot, with most of the supporting cast being replaced. Justin Theroux continues to star as a beleaguered chief of police whose wife has joined a religious cult. The world is still coming to terms with two per cent of its population suddenly disappearing. Created by Damon Lindelof ( Lost ) and Tom Perrotta, The Leftovers was based on Perrotta’s book about the aftermath of a “Rapture”-type event. With season one burning through all of the source material, the producers want to show the after-effects of the “Sudden Departure” beyond the fictional New York town of Mapleton. The Affair Catch the first season with Sky Box Sets before the new season arrives on Sky TV Photo: The Affair © Showtime Networks Inc. All rights reserved. Season one of The Affair told the story of an adulterous liaison from the perspective of the adulterer (Dominic West) and adulteress (Ruth Wilson). The twist is that they are both recounting their versions of the affair to an investigating detective. The new season of the show expands the perspectives to those of the wronged wife (Maura Tierney) and the cuckolded husband (Joshua Jackson). Two points of view will be given in each episode – the question is whose. Or, as the show’s tagline puts it, “There are more than two sides to every story.” Jackson is pleased that the canvas has been expanded in this second season of the show, which won two Golden Globe Awards – Best Television Series and Best Actress. “By allowing [my character] Cole to have an interior life, it allows me to show him in a way that being Noah’s recollection or Alison’s recollection just doesn’t,” Jackson said. “It’s opened up for me an entirely different world for this character.” All four perspectives will twist round each other for the season’s climax. Karl Pilkington: The Moaning of Life Catch the first season with Sky Box Sets before the new season arrives on Sky TV Ricky Gervais’s favourite “round-headed buffoon” goes round the world again trying to find answers to life’s most troubling questions. Attempting to see how other cultures solve the problem of children, marriage and even death, Karl puts himself in extreme, sometimes surreal situations from posing as a life-drawing model to training for a Mars expedition and even throwing himself out of a plane strapped to a skydiving granny. • Watch back-to-back episodes of Sky’s biggest TV shows like these and more with Sky Box Sets.
