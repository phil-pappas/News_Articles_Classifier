This led firms to keep payroll numbers unchanged during the month,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economist at Markit, which compiled the survey.\nOn inflation, the survey found that falling global commodity prices resulted in an overall reduction in cost burdens and this would provide companies with more room for price negotiations.\n“As inflation concerns fade and demand growth loses momentum, further accommodative policy should not be discounted,” Lima added.\nRBI Governor Raghuram Rajan , who has been under pressure from the government and the industry to further cut rates, said this weekend that RBI remains in an “accommodative mode” and would take a decision as per the data on inflation and other macroeconomic factors.\nRBI, which has lowered rates thrice so far this year by 25 basis points each, is scheduled to hold its next bi-monthly monetary policy review on September 29. However, two of the three rate cuts this year have been announced outside the scheduled reviews.\nThe GDP data released yesterday by the government also showed the growth rate slipping to 7 per cent in the April-June quarter, from 7.5 per cent in the preceding quarter. Besides, the infrastructure sector output growth also slowed down to a three-month low of 1.1 per cent in July, further making case for a rate cut by RBI.\nFirst Published on September 01, 2015 11:39 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T16:23:32.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
