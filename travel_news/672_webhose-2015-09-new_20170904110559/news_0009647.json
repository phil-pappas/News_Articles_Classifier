Can't I use action to repay the love for me from Taiwan?\"\nOnline images of the set show two versions of the stored value cards -- an \"Angel\" and a \"Demon.\"\nThere is no nudity in either image, one of which features Hatano wearing white, the other black.\nCards sold out in four hours\nControversy aside, it would appear some have no problems carrying around Hatano's image in their wallets.\nOn September 1, EasyCard announced the 15,000 available cards had already sold out by 4:18 a.m. local time, just four hours after phone lines opened.\nAll of the proceeds from the cards, priced at NT$250, are being donated to charity, said the company.\nAccording to English-language news site Focus Taiwan , a \"Purchase Yui Hatano EasyCards\" Facebook campaign drew approximately 47,000 members.\nMany fans complained the phone line was constantly busy.\n\"This was the first time I wanted to contribute to charity this much, but not even a single phone call got through,\" said one fan, as Quote: d by Focus Taiwan.", "external_links": ["http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2015/08/27/2003626277", "http://www.cna.com.tw/news/firstnews/201508275005-1.aspx", "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/1854380/porn-stars-special-edition-swipe-cards-taiwan-sell-out-within", "http://focustaiwan.tw/search/201509010005.aspx?q=Yui%20Hatano%20"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T17:18:07.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
