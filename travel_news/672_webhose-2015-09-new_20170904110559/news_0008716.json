There was no reffing in that area.\n“”We knew that was their (Melbourne’s) style, and they’ve have been doing it for 10 years.\n“The game has moved on a bit this year (with tidying up the ruck), but probably not as much tonight as it has over the last few weeks as well at different times.\n“We know finals change. They (referees) pull out of the game, and we know that. They’re only there for errors.\n“That opens the door for a lot of teams this weekend.\nROOSTERS V STORM PLAYER RATINGS: Who starred, who flopped\nMATCH REPORT: Rising Storm flip the NRL premiership script\nSTORM REACTION: Bellamy rapt as battered Melbourne stun Roosters\n“They’ve decided on a style of play they want to play this year (in regards to the ruck). There has been a change in interpretation to allow that.\n“But you should also allow teams to work it out themselves, and they should step in when that’s not being adhered to. That wasn’t quite the case tonight.’’\nRoosters players watch on after a Storm try. The Storm have mastered the art of the wrestle _ a term they dread _ with skipper Cameron Smith the best.\nThey turned on a masterclass against Cronulla a month ago, which was not lost on Sharks coach Shane Flanagan at that post-match press conference.\nBut while Robinson would have liked that area cleaned up, he also wasn’t using it as an excuse for the shock loss.\nThe Chooks were outplayed. They butchered a golden chance to rocket straight through to week three of the finals and remain in Sydney.\nRobinson said he “couldn’t care less’’ if they met Canterbury or the Dragons next Friday.\nRoger Tuivasa-Sheck runs the ball for the Roosters. Even when Shaun Kenny-Dowall finished a 66th-minute try to get the Chooks back to within two points _ the long-range effort was started by a blistering run from Michael Jennings, and featured a pinpoint kick by Jackson Hastings _ something just felt off about the Bondi boys.\nRoosters press conference 5:18 NRL: Roosters coach and captain Jake Friend talk to the media following their two point loss to Melbourne in the first qualifying final.\nSeptember 11th 2015 2 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/News/ “There was a kick in it, but when you lose, it feels like more than that,’’ Robinson said.\nOne good thing is that the Roosters will almost certainly welcome back No. 7 Mitchell Pearce for next Friday’s clash.\nHaving said that, Hastings was one of the few blokes who did a good job.\n“He was pretty good today. There were quite a few guys down today, and (you can put that) down to the way Melbourne played _ you have to give credit to opposition teams who make teams play the way they want you to,’’ Robinson said.\nIsaac Liu is wrapped up by the Storm defence.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0a654193241113bdf737ae7e222c3c3c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9173e1bacee13eb30a84c6576330c901", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/30c599d0476587ec4a4dd518a5654a83?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/origin:video_integrator.pncDFodzqNyopYECObPHI9tHI9t8bwpF?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4fa7a8322bd361cd2ea475f44dfa50e6", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/122e8e8db8ff946a9dba40dd88fe4d47", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6e29e9c8444847cf20f0e86e79c868ab?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/01540d1cbf9c070498614b568c9a9341", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9806ae2a0b21c273b2e71c8c02ccc95b?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/524f4517f20a2d39a4e94ed88452de75", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F09%2F11%2FFSD_110915_RLG_NRL_ROOSTERS_PRESSER.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v1/?category=/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/&t_product=most-popular-mobile&td_standfirst=false&td_kicker=false&td_byline=false&td_resultSize=6&maxRelated=20&display:footer=true&origin=omniture&t_template=s3/chronicle-component/otherstories/templates/index&domain=dailytelegraph.com.au"], "published": "2015-09-11T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T18:03:37.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
