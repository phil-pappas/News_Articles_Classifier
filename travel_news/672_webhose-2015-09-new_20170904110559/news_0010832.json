The run took more than 17 hours to construct and meant a 4am start for Nicholls to complete filming the following morning. \nThe course finishes with a kicker that takes Nicholls over some railings and into the car park \nHe said: “I am excited to see if everyone likes my 2015 Hemel run as much as 2014’s footage. It’s definitely bigger and better than last year’s! I just wanted to do something more inspiring that would push the limits of UK snowboarding even further.” \nNicholls' first crazy route, filmed in 2014, has had more than seven million views . \nVisitors to this year’s Telegraph Ski & Snowboard shows in Manchester (October 30 to November 1) and London (November 5 to 8) can see Jamie Nicholls in person. He’ll be meeting fans at both shows and taking part in live Q&A sessions, plus he may even be hitting Mount Battersea, the London show’s giant real-snow kicker.
