Industry and sector professionals are expected to formulate new strategies concerning the $150 billion sector.\nThe concept of halal tourism, which concerns nearly 1.5 billion Muslims all over the world, is the fastest growing trend of global tourism. The second annual International Halal Tourism Conference, a three-day event initiated by CM Media under the sponsorship of the Culture and Tourism Ministry and Turkish Airlines, will be held from Dec. 1- 3 at the Istanbul LÃ¼tfi Kirdar Congress & Exhibition Center (ICEC).\nAccording to MasterCard-Crescent Rating Global Muslim Travel Index (GMTI) 2015 data, which is regarded as the most comprehensive research that has been conducted on the sector, the global halal tourism market totaled $150 billion and experienced 14 percent growth last year with 108 million Muslim travelers representing 10 percent of the global travel economy. This number is predicted to grow to $200 billion by 2020. While countries such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are prominent actors in this sector, many more countries, regardless of their religious majority, are trying to attract Muslim tourists from all over the world by offering them facilities in accordance with their religious beliefs.\nThe event is expected to bring together the global tourism industry and sector professionals to discuss strategies on how to tap this niche market. More than 1,000 international delegates from 30 countries are expected to attend the International Halal Tourism Conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T20:32:27.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
