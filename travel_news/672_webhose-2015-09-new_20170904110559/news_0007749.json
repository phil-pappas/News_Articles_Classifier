These will be: Abu Dhabi Air Expo 2016, Middle East Aviation Career Conference & Exhibition, and Abu Dhabi Heli Expo 2016.\nThe Abu Dhabi Aviation and Aerospace Week is a national initiative aimed at focusing attention on the country’s thriving aviation and aerospace sector, by hosting all major aviation related activities within Abu Dhabi during a single dedicated week.\nAbu Dhabi Airports’ three events will take place from 8th March to 10th March 2016, at Al Bateen Executive Airport, the region’s only dedicated business aviation airport.\nThis will be the fourth cycle of the Abu Dhabi Air Expo which has now become a biannual event. It brings together major players in general and business aviation, providing attendees with the chance to discover the industry’s latest developments and innovations. 70% of those who exhibited previously have already confirmed their participation at Air Expo 2016, with an expected increase of 20% to the total number of exhibitors from the last event.\nAbu Dhabi Heli Expo will also take place during Air Expo 2016, showcasing what the helicopter industry has to offer. Attendees will be able to meet representatives from leading manufacturers, distributors and support companies, and to get up close to a range of helicopters.\nEng. Mohammed Mubarak Al Mazrouei, Chief Executive Officer, Abu Dhabi Airports said: “Abu Dhabi’s aviation sector is well positioned to deliver significant and continued growth over the coming years. With 70% of the space already booked, the three events will play a crucial role in driving and supporting this growth by providing a platform for the industry to showcase exciting business and career opportunities. Exhibitors and attendees will be able to meet potential partners, exchange knowledge and share industry best practices. Abu Dhabi Airports is committed to helping achieve sustainable and well balanced development of the aviation sector – a cornerstone of Abu Dhabi’s economic growth strategy.”\nThe Middle East Aviation Career Conference, which will run in parallel with the Air Expo, will give a unique platform for young professionals seeking a career in the aviation industry to explore the wide range of opportunities that are open to them. They will be encouraged to interact with industry experts and learn about key training and recruitment trends within the aviation sector.\nAl Mazrouei continued, “The future projections of the level of required manpower in aviation are staggering, with huge demand expected for professionals trained in both hard and soft skills. It is important to ensure that there are enough qualified human resources for this sector, to operate, manage and further develop future air transport systems. This is vital to support our long term future growth strategy.”\nIn addition to the main exhibition area, Abu Dhabi Air Expo will feature a large outdoor area with a static display of over 120 of the latest aircraft on the market. There will also be a dedicated area for airport suppliers where companies can display their products and services for airport maintenance, security, ground support, air traffic management, and terminal and fixed based operations facilities.\nSource:- Abu Dhabi Airports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T08:45:27.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
