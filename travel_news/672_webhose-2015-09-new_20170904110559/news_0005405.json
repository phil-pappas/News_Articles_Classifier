The aim is to support travel professionals with a service that enables the user to increase their knowledge of the breadth of choice Germany has to offer as a travel destination. The new online Platform, available by registering at http://germanyexpert.co.uk/ will augment the personalised, bespoke training sessions offered by the GNTO.\nThe introduction of this new desk training software reflects the continual, increasing interest in Germany as a travel destination, with a rise in international overnight stays recently recorded for the 69th month in a row. The number of overnight stays by visitors from the UK in 2014 rose by 4.2 % and for first half year of 2015 alone, there has been a 5 % rise in overnight stays by international visitors to Germany.\nThe training Platform comprises 5 modules, covering all aspects of travel in Germany. It\nprovides an in depth knowledge about all aspects of tourism throughout the different regions and allows travel professionals to learn at their own pace. Once completed, it offers a comprehensive overview of the strengths and advantages of Germany as a product and\nacts as a sales aid. The module is particularly suitable not only for tour operators and travel agents, but for homeworkers too and across all sizes of travel business.\nKlaus Lohmann, director of the GNTO for the UK and Ireland, said: “The GNTO’s new online training Platform will be an invaluable facility for the travel trade. The interest in Germany is continually rising and to help travel professionals meet that demand, we want to provide as much support we can, to help people benefit from the opportunities available through this increased interest in destination Deutschland”.", "external_links": ["http://germanyexpert.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T22:08:57.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
