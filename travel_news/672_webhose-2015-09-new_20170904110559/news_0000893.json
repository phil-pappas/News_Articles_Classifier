The result of the state’s cool winters and warm summers is a landscape dotted with good things to eat and drink, and some fine locations in which to try them. Those fields and trees are usually framed by a picture window from a welcoming restaurant or tasting room, where local produce is astutely matched with the home-grown beverages. As well as fertile ground for out-of-town adventures, this bounty means a state capital packed with great restaurants, bars – and cafés, because the Italians and Greeks who came to Melbourne in the Fifties ensured the city a headstart on good caffeine, and the happy results of that ongoing addiction are visible all over town. Given this choice overload, it’s a good thing that Victorians don’t take themselves too seriously, or the vexed decision of where to brunch or dine, and which bars to visit for a pre-prandial sharpener or an after-dinner digestif, could be overwhelming. Instead, unless you’re going for must-book fine dining options such as Attica or Vue du monde, it’s a question of wandering the city’s famous laneways, poking a head into Tonka, Chin Chin or Supernormal to decide whether you feel like contemporary Indian, Asian fusion or Andrew McConnell’s ceviche, dumplings and lobster rolls. These places are recognisably Victorian: they look beautiful, they love visitors – and they are overflowing with locally grown treats to eat and drink Tonka has a great wine list and rows of Eurocave storage to go with it; Chin Chin is a young vibe, with loud music and a no-booking policy; Supernormal is a large yet curiously friendly concrete box, and McConnell (Cumulus, Cutler & Co, the much-lamented Golden Fields, now Luxembourg bistro) is a Melbourne legend. All these and so many more are close enough to throw a lobster roll from one to another, but if you need time to consider, grab a cocktail with a great city view at Madame Brussels or a Negroni in Bar Ampere, which has one of the most extensive vermouth selections in the southern hemisphere, and ponder your options. It may take some time. As for coffee, Melbourne has solved the vexed problem of how to drink it by the premium bucketload without making brunch an institution. Whether you get your fix over house-baked banana bread with caramel mascarpone at The Little Ox near Brighton beach, gigantic portions of blueberry pancakes at Kettle Black or Top Paddock, Louisiana gumbo or Koo Koo Ca Choo (potato hash with poached eggs and wild mushrooms) at St Ali, double Wagyu patty burger at Seven Seeds or the best vegan food you’ll ever taste at Smith and Daughters, you will wash down your meal with superlative coffee. The other major Melbourne problem is which nearby wine region works best for a couple of days of gourmandising. An hour north-east, in the Yarra Valley, is Yering Station with a fine glass-walled restaurant next to the vineyards and the beautiful Chateau Yering Hotel next door. There is also Oakridge Winery, its restaurant set in a spectacular architect-designed building, and Giant Steps, where the winery is supplemented by a coffee roaster, cheese room and bakery. Float above the Yarra Valley vineyards in a hot-air balloon Many of the hippest young winemakers can’t yet afford these spectacular cellar-door restaurants but to try their wines, visit Graceburn in Healesville: a simple bar opened by local Mac Forbes to showcase his own excellent wines but also a place where, in the generous spirit of Victoria’s younger generation of winemakers, he guest-lists the wines of talented friends such as Luke Lambert or Gary Mills of Jamsheed. The Yarra Valley is also home to the Four Pillars distillery, where Stu, Matt and Cam make premium gin in a German copper still called Wilma. As for cider and beer, follow the Cider and Ale Trail, whose seven producers include Coldsteam Brewery and Punt Road Wines. An alternative way to explore the valley is on a small group tour with, say, the Australian Wine Touring Company. Or take a balloon ride over the whole Yarra Valley – an unbelievable experience, if one best enjoyed in conjunction with on-the-ground visits, as aesthetic appreciation of the fertile landscape works much better when you can taste its output, too. If, instead, you turn south out of Melbourne, you will quickly find yourself on the outcrop known as the Mornington Peninsula, which has become particularly well known for pinot noir and chardonnay, but also has superb cellar-door restaurants to showcase those wines: from Yabby Lake to Paringa Estate to Ten Minutes by Tractor, some of the best wineries are pairing their products with wonderful food for those wise enough to sit down and enjoy the two together, as nature and winemakers intended. Their chefs don’t have a hard time sourcing great produce: as the farmers’ markets and farmgate shops that dot the Mornington Peninsula indicate, it grows a great deal more than grapes. Melbourne has solved the vexed problem of how to drink coffee by the premium bucketload without making brunch an institution At Mock Red Hill’s Cider Lounge and the Red Hill Brewery’s summer barbecues, the purveyors of beer and cider follow their vine-growing neighbours’ lead in offering plenty of premium stomach-liners to accompany their beverages. There is much more to tasting Victoria than the convenient trio of Melbourne, Yarra Valley and Mornington Peninsula: there’s also Geelong and the Grampians, Beechworth further north, the beer trail of the High Country or the Prosecco Road in King Valley, where the descendants of Italian immigrants make very Australian wine from much-loved Italian grape varieties. Despite their differences, all these places are recognisably Victorian: they look beautiful, they love visitors – and they are overflowing with locally grown treats to eat and drink.
