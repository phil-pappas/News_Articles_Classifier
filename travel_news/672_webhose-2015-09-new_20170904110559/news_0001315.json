Having achieved his initial objective, though, he quickly realised his struggle was just beginning. At a meeting for the UN commanders of the country’s 13 district and regional headquarters, Mr Su, a senior police officer in northern Tianjin, realised he and an officer from Thailand were the only Asians there. The country is taking on more international reponsibilities with the UN Photo: Provided to China Daily An officer from the New York Police Department, one of 200 peacekeepers under Mr Su’s command, was also regularly questioning his chief’s ability. “I could sense his doubts and mistrust during our conversations and from the expression on his face I could feel the tension between us,” he recalled. “It was understandable. He had never met a Chinese officer before let alone been commanded by one. I had to win people’s trust.” The UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations was founded in 1948. Its force, instantly identifiable by its powder-blue berets and helmets, comprises soldiers, police officers and civilians from almost every UN member state. Although the force in East Timor included more than 40 Chinese officers, Mr Su was the only one in a position of authority. At that time, the country still lacked the resources and experience to contribute fully. Now, after years of having peacekeepers in the field, the situation has changed and China is now the largest contributor of personnel to the department’s missions. Co-operation is key “During my one-year tour in East Timor I won the trust of officers from other countries, including the one from NYPD. It wasn’t about competition but co-operation,” Mr Su said. “As a leader, I was able to participate in the decision-making process and contribute a great deal.” In 2008, he went on to work as a mission manager at the UN headquarters in New York. China has sent more than 30,000 peacekeepers to nine countries and regions, including Afghanistan and Haiti, and the country will continue to “play an increasingly important role in missions by offering experts, team leaders and a range of peacekeeping forces”, according to Zhu Ming, deputy directorgeneral of the Ministry of Public Security’s International Co-operation Department. He said Chinese army officers have held high-level positions with the Department of Peacekeeping Operations at the New York headquarters and in the field while more than 60 officers have also filled senior roles in regional task areas. Pang Bo, 43, of Guangdong province, has been involved in several operations. As a senior officer in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002, he initially worked with the local police on investigations and patrols but was later appointed as an assistant to the chief of operations, which enabled him to participate in operation across the entire mission spectrum. In 2004, he became deputy chief of operations in Haiti. “A higher position means more work and responsibility but it also means you may be able to make a greater number of changes,” he said. At least we didn’t have to worry about stray bullets when walking in the street When he first entered the notorious Sun City slum on the outskirts of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, he said the smell of rubbish and burning tyres almost suffocated him. “A number of UN officers died in conflicts during my time there. The place was in chaos.” His team went on to employ a number of tactics to encourage the locals to hand in their weapons, including offering to exchange tickets for a football match between Haiti and Brazil for guns. After a year of such initiatives the situation improved, he said. “At least we didn’t have to worry about stray bullets when walking in the street.” The competition to win promotion was intense, Mr Pang said, but the rising number of Chinese in positions of authority was a result of their improved abilities and leadership skills. “People used to have the impression that Chinese officers are shy and quiet so these peacekeeping missions present many opportunities for the world to learn more about the Chinese police and even China. China is playing an increasingly important role in international missions Photo: Provided to China Daily \"When I was on deployment in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002, a French peacekeeper told me he had never seen a Chinese police officer there before. A German policeman also told me that until he had visited Shanghai he didn’t believe China could have a world-class metropolis.” China sent formed police units (FPUs) to Haiti in 2004 and Liberia in 2013. According to the UN website, each FPU consists of 140 officers who undertake crowd control, protect UN staff and materials and escort UN personnel in dangerous or unsecured mission areas. Practice makes perfect Shao Weimin, 41, was a member of the Chinese unit sent to Haiti. “Not every country is able to send FPUs because of the high standards required for personnel and equipment ,” he said, explaining that compared with regular police units FPUs are expected to deal with complicated situations in a faster and more efficient way. He said he heard gunshots every day in Haiti and the tough security situation required strong support from the FPU. “Before we assembled our first unit we didn’t know how to do it but we learned by practise and experience,” said Mr Shao, who headed China’s first team of 30 peacekeepers to the Caribbean country. “We prepared a draft action plan and amended it according to the reports sent back by the team. We made a lot of alterations, including changing our long-sleeved uniform to shortsleeved because of the hot and humid weather.” China’s peacekeeping force has improved greatly in the past 15 years, he said. But there is still room for improvement, particularly in equipment such as bulletproof vests, which he said are currently too long and hamper movement. “China’s participation in peacekeeping came a little late in the day but we’ve learned quickly and actively,” he added. During an inspection of Beijing’s Peacekeepers Training Centre in 2013, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised China’s contribution and professionalism and said the UN wanted to strengthen its partnership with the country. As one of the UN Security Council's permanent members, China shoulders its responsibilities On Jan 21, the headquarters of the peacekeepers in Liberia also formally thanked China’s peacekeepers and FPUs for their work in creating conditions for lasting peace during the recent Ebola outbreak in west Africa. Mr Zhu at the Ministry of Public Security said many countries had withdrawn their peacekeepers when the outbreak occurred but the Chinese units had stayed while medical support was strengthened to protect personnel from infection. Guo Fenghai, a professor at the National Defence University of the People’s Liberation Army, said China is assuming greater responsibility in line with its growing economic strength. “As China is one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, it is shouldering its responsibilities accordingly, such as taking the lead in peacekeeping missions,” he said. “Like many other overseas deployments, peacekeeping is a great opportunity to build China’s image,” he said, referring to antipiracy escort missions by the PLA Navy off the coast of Somalia, and the provision of medical aid overseas. “Equally important, though, is that the missions also provide many opportunities to learn and improve the services we offer.” This article was originally produced and published by China Daily . • Read more about Chinese current affairs at China Watch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T02:24:38.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
