There was “slight pandemonium”, its reporter said. \n“Dozens of ambulances are heading to the site. The authorities closed off the area shortly afterwards,” he said. \n“This whole place is already a construction site. What made it worse is that around 5.30pm there was severe rain and it’s just gushing down the road,” he said. “I am surrounded by people who are grieving. The mood here is of sadness.” \nThe Masjid al-Haram surrounds Islam's holiest site, the Kaaba - a shrine that worshipers visit during the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-11T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T23:00:25.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
