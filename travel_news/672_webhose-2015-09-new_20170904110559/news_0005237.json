Last year, Bhutan received 133,000 tourists in total, out of which 68,000 were Indians.\nThe upcoming visit of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to Bhutan next month is expected to boost tourist arrivals from the state, tourism officials said.\nTour operators also said it was difficult to provide quality service and security in Bhutan if Indian tourists do not come through formal channels.\nPresident of Bhutan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI), Ugen Tshechup Dorji, said the informal tourism sector has to be streamlined to provide the best of services. “One of the ways to make tourists come back to Bhutan again and again is by giving them good experience through quality service,” he said.\nHe also said it was important for Bhutan to harness the potential of tourism market in India, one of the largest economies in the world. “So far, we have never looked next door (India), where there is a huge potential,” he said.\nHowever, Ugen Tshechup Dorji also said there was a need to create adequate awareness on Bhutan as a tourist destination for potential Indian tourists. He said Bhutan was better known in Europe than in India.\nThe Indian tour operators said that today more Indian tourists fly into Bhutan, supporting the country’s high-end tourism policy. He said many Indian tourists are now paying more than Nu 10,000 a night and stay in hotels like the Le Meriden and Terma Linka.\nWhile some participants from India said airfares should be cheaper to encourage Indian customers to use flights, others asked for Indian chefs in hotels.\nSpeaking at the seminar, labour minister Ngeema Sangay Tshempo said tourists are encouraged to hire guides and come through local tour agents. “We treat tourists as our guests and they should not be left on their own,” he said, adding that the government encourages guided tourists.\nThe minister said the government was looking at taking tourists to eastern and southern Bhutan to avoid over-crowding in west and central dzongkhags.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T00:04:51.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
