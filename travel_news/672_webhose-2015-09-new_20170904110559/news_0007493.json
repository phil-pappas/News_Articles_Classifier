The French resort is split into four separate villages: Arc 1600, the lowest and smallest village; Arc 1800, which has a new activity area including a toboggan run and children’s practice area; Arc 1950, the newest village, which is car-free with a great choice of restaurants and bars; and Arc 2000, which is convenient for accessing the Aiguille Rouge glacier and offers a great base for doorstep skiing and snowboarding. With 200km of pistes to explore and a cable car connection to the slopes of neighbouring La Plagne, there’s terrain to suit every level, whether you’re hunting for off piste or are content to cruise the intermediate slopes. Les Arcs has teamed up with Erna Low and Eurotunnel Le Shuttle to offer Telegraph Ski and Snowboard readers the chance to win a seven-night stay in Arc 1950 for four people, staying at the five-star Pierre et Vacances Premium self-catering apartments with access to the spa, swimming pool and sauna. The prize includes a return flexiplus car crossing with Eurotunnel and six-day Paradiski lift passes. The closing date for entries is midnight on November 3 2015. Terms and conditions apply.
