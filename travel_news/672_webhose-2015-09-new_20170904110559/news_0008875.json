The British Airways (BA) passengers who were in the plane that caught fire in Las Vegas Airport have been severely criticised for grasping their hand luggage instead of trying to evacuate the plane in a hurry without risking their life and the lives of other passengers.\nThe London bound British Airways flight that was forced to evacuate 170 passengers leaving 14 injured as people were trying to get down in a hurry and some were probably delayed as luggage space disrupted continuous movement out of the plane.\nPeople who were carrying their hand luggage were subjected to immense criticism with accusations like these tourists value their own material possessions over human life. Some crticised passengers for displaying ‘misplaced priorities’.\nPassengers generally follow the instructions sent to them by the airline staff feels Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US. According to the flying rules set by the FAA, retrieving personal items may impede the safe evacuation of passengers. Mostly people are panic struck and often do not know how to react. So it is the duty of the airline staff to help the passengers out. Spending time in trying to open the overhead bin to retrieve personal luggage is highly dangerous when a plane has caught fire as the air is very toxic and each passenger will be expending a lot of energy by using the available oxygen.\nMost people flying think that nothing will happen to them and miss the safety video shown before flying. As a result they do not know how they should react when such a situation actually arises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T00:17:37.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
