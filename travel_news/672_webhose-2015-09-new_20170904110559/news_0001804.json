As well as spending more, the number of passenger days in port also increased to an estimated 49,411.\n“We warmly welcome the cruise industry here to the Territory and we are certainly ready for more cruise ship traffic, including expedition cruise ships exploring our remote northern coastlines.\n“One of the centrepieces of our 2015-16 Budget the installation of a new shaded walkway that will allow cruise ship passengers to stroll from the terminal to the Waterfront Precinct in comfort.\n“It’s all part of the Country Liberals Government’s plan to drive the development of North Australia and build a $2.2 billion visitor economy by 2020.”\nMr Giles said a cruise ship visitor survey conducted by Tourism NT, Tourism Research Australia and Cruise Down Under during the 2014-15 cruise ship season was also released this week.\nSome of the survey highlights include:\nOverall satisfaction with Darwin among passengers surveyed was very high, with more than nine in 10 passengers (94%) reporting they were either “satisfied” or “very satisfied”;\nAspects of Darwin that rated highest include safety and security (97%); level of customer service (96%); and friendliness of locals (95%);\nSixty per cent of passengers said they were likely or very likely to return to Darwin and of these, 64% said they were likely or very likely to do so in the next two years;\nEighty-seven per cent said they would recommend a visit to Darwin to their friends and family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T14:03:47.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
