The edition has been expanded to 80 pages and now includes a number of beautiful two-page photographs – including aerial views – that vividly capture the hotel barge cruise experience, plus detailed cruise route maps and itineraries.\nEuropean Waterways’ 2016/17 program also highlights the newest addition to its fleet, the luxury hotel barge Finesse. Starting in May 2016, the Finesse will cruise the scenic River Saône and the Canal du Centre in Southern Burgundy. A very modern and well-designed interior allows plenty of natural light to shine through and guests can relax on the large sun deck with its alfresco dining area and spa pool. The vessel accommodates up to eight passengers in four spacious, air-conditioned twin or double-bedded suites, all with well-appointed ensuite facilities.\nEuropean Waterways also continues to develop its popular themed cruises to keep up with demand from a wider range of guests. Among the themed cruises featured in the 2016/17 program are Wine Appreciation, Walking, Golf, and Opera cruises. Families and other small groups can also charter a hotel barge, with the opportunity to customize the itinerary to meet their special interests.\n“The new brochure is larger, more colorful, and more detailed than ever before, and we think it really conveys the serenity and beauty of a European Waterways hotel barge cruising vacation,” said Derek Banks, managing director of European Waterways. “It’s the perfect selling tool for travel agents whose clients seek a unique and special holiday experience in Europe.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T20:16:57.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
