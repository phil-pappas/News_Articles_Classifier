The number one course in Portugal* has updated its existing golf car fleet, following delivery of 55 new Precedent i3 vehicles.\nThe fleet features Club Car’s latest interactive touch screen ‘connected’ technology, Visage, which provides golfers with precise shot and distance information. The system also enables Monte Rei’s staff to remotely control each car, optimise course maintenance with ‘no-drive’ zones and monitor pace-of-play.\nDavid Shepherd, Director of Golf at Monte Rei, said: “Club Car and Golfejardim were the obvious choice when we chose to update the entire vehicle fleet. We are delighted with the service and the quality of cars provided, and look forward to continuing to work closely with both companies.\nThe new fleet and continued investment in improving the course and service provided to our customers is vital to ensure we continue to provide every Monte Rei guest with an unrivalled experience. The addition of the GPS technology is something that is now demanded by guests at the best resorts and has already proved very popular.”\nKevin Hart, Sales Director Golf for EMEA at Club Car, said: “Club Car is associated with many of the world’s leading golf destinations, with the company’s commitment to customer service and providing high quality, reliable vehicles key to the success of these relationships.\n“Our exacting standards perfectly mirror those of Monte Rei and we look forward to continuing to work alongside one of Europe’s leading golf venues.”\nMonte Rei has gained recognition around the world as a premier golf and family destination and, since its opening seven years ago, it has been ranked several years in a row as the number one golf course in Portugal. Monte Rei continues to grow and the past few years have seen a number of developments take shape at the resort, with the introduction of fully serviced rental villas, along with the opening of Veranda, which includes a restaurant and bar, tennis courts, swimming pools, gymnasium and spa.\nSource:- IAGTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:13:50.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
