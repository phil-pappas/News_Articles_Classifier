Responding to the consultation, Heathrow illustrated how an improved runway design from that rejected in 2010 maximises the level of respite that can be provided to local communities, whilst reducing the number of people affected by significant noise by at least 200,000. The plans also ensure there are no more airport-related vehicles on the road than there are today - helping to make sure that air quality limits are not exceeded. \nIt’s an approach which has been endorsed by the independent Airports Commission, who unanimously concluded in July this year that a third runway should be built at Heathrow. On carbon emissions, the Commission confirmed that Heathrow was compatible with the government’s target of 37.5MtCO2 emissions from aviation by 2050, and that: “Heathrow’s location and its much greater public transport connectivity (both locally and to the country as a whole) makes it the most efficient location in terms of carbon emissions due to surface access.” On noise, the Commission found that an expanded Heathrow can be better than today, and that “a bigger Heathrow would not inflict more noise nuisance on more people than it does today.” The Airports Commission also confirmed that Heathrow expansion can be delivered within air quality limits, whilst Heathrow is confident that it can deliver emissions reductions targets surpassing the conservative calculations prepared by the Commission. \nTaken in total, the measures mean that Heathrow’s plan is fair and deliverable, balancing the airport’s critical role in helping British businesses compete for global growth and supporting a recovery built on exports, skills and investment, with the concerns of those living nearby. \nIt will also give the airport the ability to act as a catalyst for environmental innovation, fast tracking research and development. Heathrow already hosts the world’s largest single site car sharing scheme, has the UK’s only free airport public transport travel zone and the UK’s first publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling site. Matt Gorman, Director of Sustainability, said: “This is a plan which doesn’t force a choice between the environment and the economy - it will deliver for both. We have gone back to the drawing board, designed an improved approach and put forward a proposal for expansion unanimously recommended by the Airports Commission. A bigger Heathrow will be a better Heathrow for our local communities, compatible with carbon emissions targets, air quality limits and with fewer people impacted by noise than today.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T18:04:21.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
