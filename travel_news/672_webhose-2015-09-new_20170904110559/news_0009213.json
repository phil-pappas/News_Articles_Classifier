A total of £300,000 of funding has been designated within this scheme specifically for food and drink experiences at events.\nThe year will include a special food or drink theme for each month of the calendar.\nThere was a large attendance from the tourism and hospitality industry at the launch in Titanic Belfast.\nSpeaking at the event Tourism NI chairman Terence Brannigan said: “In the past few years Northern Ireland has experienced positive increases in tourism and has made significant progress in building a reputation for excellence in food production and hospitality. This initiative is a major opportunity to tie all of these successes together under the one banner for a year-long celebration of all that is good about our food and drink.\n“Food and drink is an absolutely essential part of the visitor experience as it accounts for a significant proportion of visitor spend, and is therefore a key element of the economy. The Year of Food and Drink 2016 will highlight, celebrate and capitalise on our wonderful food and drink stories. I am confident this will make a large contribution both to the Northern Ireland economy and to the drive to deliver on the long-term aims of the industry to the end of the decade.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T03:30:31.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
