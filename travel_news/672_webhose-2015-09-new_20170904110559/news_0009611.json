Whether you’re getting up early to fit in a gym session pre-work, regularly spending your evenings in the office to get all your work done, dealing with broken nights because of children or simply suffering from old-fashioned insomnia, according to the NHS, an estimated one in three of us suffers from poor sleep. And, because lack of sleep is associated with a host of conditions – from the simple irritability and sugar cravings that you get after one night of disrupted sleep to more long-term issues such as diabetes, heart conditions and obesity – it makes sense to try to sort out your sleep. But just how much is enough? A recent review of more than 300 publications by the National Sleep Foundation in the United States concluded that most adults should be getting between seven and nine hours of sleep a night, although they acknowledged that sleep is a very personal thing and that some people would not suffer from sleeping for just six hours a night, and others may need as many as 10 hours. To work out what your requirements are, they suggest you ask yourself a series of questions: whether you are unproductive and unhappy on seven hours of sleep, whether you have health issues such as being overweight, whether you depend on caffeine to get you through the day or if you feel sleepy when driving. Answering “yes” could indicate that you need to up your sleep time. The Sleep Council advocates switching off all technology an hour before bed, using dim lighting in the evenings and avoiding alcohol That’s all very well in theory, but it requires some changes. While there are some things that aren’t necessarily within your power to change – such as screaming children – experts agree that good “sleep hygiene”, which is essentially creating a mental and physical environment that is as conducive to sleep as possible, is the way to achieve sleep nirvana. The Sleep Council advocates switching off all technology an hour before bed, using dim lighting in the evenings, avoiding alcohol and stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine, and creating a restful, comfortable bedroom, with blackout blinds if necessary. The key is also to create a bedtime routine and stick to it. “Have a warm bath that relaxes you. Then, when you get out, your body temperature will drop, which encourages sleep,” says Professor Jim Horne, director of the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University. He adds: “Then do something that engages your hands and your eyes before bed. It sounds mad, but a jigsaw is brilliantly distracting and helps you switch off.” Stressing about not sleeping and clock-watching exacerbates the problem, so Prof Horne suggests setting the alarm and hiding it under the bed. If you can’t sleep, get up and have a warm drink, and try to absorb yourself in something that will occupy you before going back to bed, he recommends. “If you’re sleepy during the day, you probably do need more sleep, but insomnia is a state of mind,” he says. You have to believe that you’ll sleep better tonight than you did last night, he adds. And, if you’re still struggling, sleep restriction therapy can help. “Tell yourself you’re only allowed to sleep between midnight and six. Even if you don’t fall asleep until 5am the first night, get up at six. The next night you’ll sleep longer. When you’re regularly sleeping for six hours, start extending it gradually.” Geberit knows that well-being starts at home It’s easy to make small life changes to improve your health and happiness – and that includes investing in your bathroom.
