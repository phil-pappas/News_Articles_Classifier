This is an exciting time for IHG in Germany as we continue to grow a pipeline of quality hotels here with our portfolio of preferred brands.”\nIHG said it plans to double the number of hotels in Germany, open or in development, over the next five years.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/thomasnewcombe"], "published": "2015-09-30T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T16:05:47.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
