Photographer's Note \nThe São Paulo Museum of Art (Portuguese: Museu de Arte de São Paulo, or MASP) is an art museum located on Paulista Avenue in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. It is well known for its headquarters, a 1968 concrete and glass structure designed by Lina Bo Bardi, whose main body is supported by two lateral beams over a 74 metres (243 ft) freestanding space, considered a landmark of the city and a main symbol of modern Brazilian architecture. The museum is a private non-profit institution founded in 1947 by Assis Chateaubriand and Pietro Maria Bardi. MASP distinguished itself for many important initiatives concerning museology and art education in Brazil, as well as for its pioneering role as a cultural center. The museum is internationally recognized for its collection of European art, considered the finest in Latin America and all Southern Hemisphere. \nNobody has marked this note useful", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T02:11:34.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
