The Zundert Bloemencorso is the oldest annual flower parade in Europe – dating back to 1936 – and only dahlias are used to decorate the towering sculptures. The flowers are grown specifically for the parade and around 600,000 are used. This year’s theme was the work of local hero Vincent van Gogh, born in Zundert in 1853. Around 50,000 people attend.
