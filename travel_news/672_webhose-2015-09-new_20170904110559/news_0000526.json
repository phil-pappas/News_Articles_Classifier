Following its record breaking Kickstarter campaign, BauBax has transitioned seamlessly to Indiegogo InDemand where backers continue to take advantage of reduced pricing by pre-ordering BauBax's sweatshirts, windbreakers, bombers and blazers at discounted prices.\n“Consumers have told us by the tens of thousands with their pre-orders and positive feedback that our BauBax jackets are in high demand,\" said Yoganshi Shah, founder and Chief Design Officer of BauBax. \"Indiegogo InDemand has allowed us to provide a seamless continuation of the ordering process so that we can offer our products at value pricing to travelers from around the world.”\nSince its July 7th Kickstarter launch, BauBax has taken off in popularity thanks to its 15 features that include: a built-in and instantly inflatable neck pillow, eye mask, tech pockets of all sizes, a drink pocket, gloves, a zipper with a pen and stylus and more.\nWith a built-in neck pillow and eye mask, BauBax jackets are ideal for travelers who like to catch up on sleep during long flights. Passports, wallets, tablets, smartphones, earphones, sunglasses, portable charger, pocket blanket and water bottles are just some of the many items that can be carried in a BauBax jacket.\nBauBax Jackets are available for pre-order on Indiegogo InDemand in multiple colors and comfortable styles (sweatshirt/hoodie, windbreaker, bomber jacket and wrinkle free blazer with removable hood).\nFor more information visit BauBax on Indiegogo InDemand .\nAbout BauBax\nBauBax LLC is a Chicago based startup focused on developing creative lifestyle products.
