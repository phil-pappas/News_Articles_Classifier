What you might not realise is that the entertainment goes beyond the grand parades and hanging out with Mickey Mouse – though these should certainly not be missed. Disney entertainment ranges from magic and firework shows through to street-performers and sing-along parties, and might even start before breakfast. It’s a fair bet that, whatever your age, you’ll do a little clap and a shriek when you spot your favourite Disney character And while you may be spending the second part of your holiday touring the Bahamas or Caribbean on a Disney Cruise, you won’t be leaving Disney’s signature entertainment behind. In the ships’ on-board theatres, famed Broadway-style live shows are performed nightly. Featuring extraordinary sets, fabulous costumes and an array of Disney characters, the shows whisk you away to an enchanted world where everything works out well in the end. You’ll leave the theatre humming the songs for the rest of the voyage. You don’t need to head to the theatre for a show. At the sail-away party, the crew and several Disney characters – maybe Goofy and Donald Duck as well as Captain Mickey Mouse – put on a dance-and-music performance on deck where everyone is encouraged to join in and get in the holiday spirit. It’s the same on Pirate Night when Mickey and his pals invite everyone on deck after dinner to join a pirate-themed party with line-dancing, fireworks and a tense face-off between Mickey and Captain Hook. On some cruise ships you might wake to a snowy landscape, despite tropical temperatures outside. Uplifting singalong: Festival of The Lion King at Walt Disney World celebrates an explosion of colour, music and amazing talent This is a sure sign that the characters of Frozen have jumped on board to lead a day of snowman-building (yes, really), chocolate-hunting and ending with an icicle-covered deck party. Always wondered what it’s like to watch a movie down by the pool? Here’s your chance. Disney classics are shown on a giant screen on deck throughout the day and in the evening under a twinkling night sky you can also catch the latest film releases plus family favourites - some in very realistic 3-D – in one of the ship’s theatres. The shows are equally spectacular on dry land, at Walt Disney World. Whether you want to head to a show in the day or evening there are options to suit everyone. You might find Beauty and the Beast, Festival of the Lion King, a musical version of Finding Nemo and - a must for any aspiring songstresses - For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along. Toys will be toys: see a number of shows on Disney Cruise ships featuring films such as Toy Story If you’re looking for a special night-time treat, you won’t be disappointed. How about a magical evening with Tinkerbell as your guide in the show Wishes? The fairy flits across the night sky as part of a magical firework display above Cinderella’s Castle in the Magic Kingdom, accompanied by a heart-warming soundtrack of Disney songs? There are more heart-stopping moments when professional stuntmen leap from blazing cars or fall from rooftops in Lights, Motors, Action!, a show that reveals the tricks of the film trade. In Cirque du Soleil’s La Nouba, more than 65 performers, including acrobats, singers, trapeze artists, jugglers and clowns, defy gravity and human strength with daring acts of grace and imagination. The magic of Walt Disney World is that the unexpected is quite likely to happen... Turn a corner and you could find yourself playing a Hollywood starlet as part of the Citizens of Hollywood improvisation troupe at Hollywood Studios. Show-stopping moments: Fantasmic is an innovative spectacle which sees Mikey go on a magical journey Or you might find a barbershop quartet in dapper boaters and striped waistcoats doing an impromptu tap dance, just for you on the Magic Kingdom’s Main Street. Turn another corner and there might be Chinese acrobats building a human pyramid, a ragtime band, an Italian juggler or a pianist delighted to take your requests at Epcot. Don’t miss Mickey’s illuminating evening show Fantasmic at Hollywood Studios, a fireworks and water spectacular which sees the world’s most famous mouse join with heroes and princesses to overcome the evil plans of Disney’s villains. One show that should be a firm experience in everyone’s Disney holiday diary is the Festival of Fantasy Parade that winds through Magic Kingdom Park. With hi-tech floats, fabulous dancers, stilt-performers and foot-tapping music, this is where you get your chance to wave at the Disney characters, whether Cinderella, Rapunzel, Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Pinocchio, Snow White, Grumpy… It’s a fair bet that, whatever your age, you’ll do a little clap and a shriek when you spot your favourite. • Find out more about Disney Cruises, Disney holidays and Walt Disney World", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T14:22:41.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
