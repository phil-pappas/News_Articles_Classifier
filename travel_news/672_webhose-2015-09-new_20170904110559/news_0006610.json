Ancient peoples come alive in Orkney, Scotland 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nWhy I went: We’re interested in the lives of ancient peoples. But the August 2014 National Geographic article “Before Stonehenge” was the deciding factor. \nDon’t miss: Take in all the neolithic sites possible. Many are scattered across the Orkney archipelago. See also the small museums in Kirkwall, Stromness, and the fossil museum in Burray. \nDon’t bother: Taking any fancy clothes. Orkney (and Scotland in general) are casual. You’re better off with a good down vest. \nCoolest souvenir: A wee dram from the Highland Park Distillery, Kirkwall. They malt their own barley and use peat from one particular moor for smokiness. \nWorth a splurge: Hire a good, knowledgeable guide for a full-day tour tailored to your interests. \nWish I’d packed: Nothing else. I try to cover the bases and seem to have done so. \nOther comments: Orkney may seem very small, but there is a lot to see and do there. We went overland by rail, coach and ferry, which I recommend if time permits. It’s also possible to fly directly from London or Edinburgh.
