The organization was founded in 1999 by British documentary filmmaker and actor Jeremy Gilley.\nIn a study commissioned by Penn Schoen Berland on behalf of Marriott, it was revealed that international travel is considered even more important than the Internet, TV/movies, or political diplomacy at stimulating the economy and breaking down cultural barriers. The independent study was conducted by and included the views of 1,100 global travelers and opinion leaders from eight countries, including Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. [Download Study.] Ninety-six percent of respondents, who ranged in age from under 35 to over 50 years old, believed that travel and tourism stimulates the economy, while 77 percent felt that “the more people experience other countries and cultures, the more peace will spread.”\n“We hope our employees, business partners, customers and people around the world will use this day to reflect on what brings them peace,” said Mari Snyder, Vice President – Marriott International’s Corporate Social Responsibility. “Travel opens up your mind, your heart and your wallet. This survey shows it is also a powerful form of soft diplomacy in the world today.”\nSource:- Marriott", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T06:40:42.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
