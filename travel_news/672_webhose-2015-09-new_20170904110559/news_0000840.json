The show, which takes place at the Dubai World Trade Centre, November 10th – 14th, is the single largest automotive event in the Middle East and North Africa region and attracts over 100,000 visitors. \nWorking in partnership, Smart Digital and the show organisers have created DIMS LIVE - an Event TV platform that is new for this year’s event. DIMS LIVE will be the central broadcast medium for the show and will include content from the show organisers and exhibitors. Smart Digital will provide a roving camera crew and presenter to unveil breaking news, interview visitors and exhibitors and capture the sights and sounds of the show as it happens. Nick Craig Waller of Dubai International Motor Show says: “We wanted to really bring the show to life this year and capture the magic to maximise the experience for visitors and exhibitors. The new DIMS LIVE platform is the perfect addition to the show, creating a real buzz and making the most of the amazing experiences, stunning vehicles, product launches and more. The team at Smart Digital has come up with a great solution and we are looking forward to seeing it in action.” Tim Henderson, CEO of Smart Digital, adds: “We wanted to enhance the experience at this year’s show and DIMS LIVE is the perfect vehicle for this. Not only does it provide a great communications tool for the organisers, but also it provides a legacy from the event, capturing the atmosphere and further extending the audience for the show and its exhibitors via the online video player. We’re delighted to be supporting the Dubai International Motor Show and are looking forward to a great event.” DIMS LIVE content will be broadcast across 24 x 5sqm indoor LED screens flown from strategic points around the venue to optimise reach for the network content. In addition to operating the platform, Smart Digital will be providing commercial airtime packages and bespoke digital content creation services to exhibitors at the show. Content captured will also be available on the show website before, during and after the event via the DIMS LIVE player.
