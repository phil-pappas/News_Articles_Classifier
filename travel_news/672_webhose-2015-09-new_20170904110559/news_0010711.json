They can also take advantage of staying in some prime locations in Mazatlán, a resurging cultural center on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. While staying in Mazatlán, guests should take the opportunity to see the beauty of the surrounding area, says El Cid Vacations Club. The area has some truly picturesque places tourists can visit, including the serene town of Concordia. Located about 30 miles east of Mazatlán, Concordia is quaint town full of a wealth of culture and history.\nConcordia means “harmony,” and visitors can definitely feel the town’s ancient architecture and beautiful greenery come together to create a sense of peace. El Cid Vacations Club says the town is full of colonial-style homes and narrow cobbled streets, and its Catholic heritage is made apparent by what is considered Concordia’s architectural jewel, the Church of San Sebastian, which was built in the 18th century.\nThe approximately 10,000 inhabitants in Concordia are engaged in various ancestral hand-crafted works, including woodworking, pottery and agriculture. El Cid Vacations Club says Concordia and the surrounding villages in the Sierra Madre Mountains foothills are famous for the manufacture of all types of wooden furniture made from indigenous trees.\nAccording to El Cid Vacations Club, visitors can taste the delicious traditional dishes at local restaurants in Concordia. The town also has options for lodging in case a day trip turns into longer stay. With the friendliness of the locals and the relaxing nature of village life, travelers may just want a bit more time to experience Concordia at their leisure.\nEl Cid Vacations Club is a global leader in the vacation ownership and resort industry, delivering a wide variety of memorable vacation experiences for members.
