For suppliers, access to an even wider range of regulated Operator partners who are able to license content without any additional technical effort on their part, regardless if they take OGS™ delivered content direct, or via CGS.\nCorbett Sports are the first beneficiaries having today launched NextGen Gaming's smash Gorilla Go Wild slot. Peter Macdonald , Chief Operations Officer at Corbett Sports said \"We are excited to be live to market with NYX's premium and proven gaming content, and to be leveraging this opportunity seamlessly delivered by NYX OGS™ into our existing CGS integration.
