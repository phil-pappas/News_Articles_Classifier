For an unusual way to celebrate, take an air tour of the Grand Canyon. There will be helicopter and airplane tours available, and lots of tour options to choose from. Grand Canyon Tours Out Of Vegas Vegas is the place to begin an air tour of the West Rim. When you book your tour, you get to select an aerial tour or one that lands at the canyon. If you take a landing tour, you will land on top of the rim or on the canyon floor alongside the Colorado River, and if you take an aerial tour, you'll fly over the West Rim and head back to Vegas. While the aerial tours are fun and affordable, the landing tours give you a more comprehensive experience. Even though the landing tours set down at the canyon, they also fly over it so you get an aerial tour along with some fun activities on the ground. One tour comes with a boat ride along the river so you can see the canyon from the bottom up, as well as a champagne picnic on the canyon floor. If you book a tour that lands on top of the rim, you can include tickets to the popular Skywalk attraction. The Skywalk is a glass platform that suspends you 4000 feet above the canyon floor. It's an exhilarating experience that's like walking on air. Touring The South Rim By Airplane The most affordable air tours are the airplane tours, plus, they are the best option when you have a big family or group that wants to fly together. The follow the same tour route, the only difference is they fly higher than helicopters. They cost about 80 percent as much as a helicopter tour, and one thing to keep in mind is that the airplanes can't fly down to the canyon floor. Plus, you can book an airplane tour from Vegas that flies to the South Rim, but helicopters can't fly that far. Flying to the South Rim makes the most sense because it takes an hour to fly from Vegas to the South Rim, but if you drive, it will take you over five hours just to get to the main gates. When you arrive at the South Rim, you can take an aerial tour of the park that covers all the wilderness area over to the eastern border of the park and the region between the North and South Rim, also, you can take a bus tour or a fun Jeep tour too. You can choose a helicopter tour that is 30 or 50 minutes in length. The longer flight is ideal because it lets you see about 3/4 of the whole national park. You can combine tours too, so you can take an air tour as well as a Jeep or bus tour to get the most out of your experience at the South Rim, what you choose depends entirely on your budget and time. Buy Your Tour Online Before It Sells Out You'll want to book your tour in advance since it will be so busy over the Labor Day holiday. You probably want to get your tour booked as soon as you get your hotel reservations made. Buying your tour online is the most convenient way to lock in your seats, plus you'll find the lowest prices online too. An air tour of the Grand Canyon is an amazing experience you'll never forget. The Grand Canyon is filled with beauty, adventure, Native American culture, natural history, and nature at its finest, so don't miss your chance to see it while the weather is still fantastic at the canyon. \nGrand Canyon expert Lea Fallon is a HUGE fan of Canyon sightseeing flights and recommends readers go here to book them at the cheapest rates on the Internet: http://www.grandcanyondaytrips.com/grand-canyon-flights-helicopter-airplane-tours/   03 Sep   52  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T16:55:18.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
