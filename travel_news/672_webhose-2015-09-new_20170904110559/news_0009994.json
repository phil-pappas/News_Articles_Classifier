More Macau economy contracts by 26% \nOn completion, Bwin shareholders will own two-thirds of the combined group in a reverse takeover. \nThe offer is made up of 25p-per-share in cash with the remainder in shares. GVC previously secured a loan from Cerberus, the private equity group, for €400m and said it had a full subscription for a placing of £150m of new shares. \n“This has been a long and necessarily protracted process,” said Philip Yea, the chairman of Bwin. “We were balancing some very fine points at the margin.” \nOver the past week, Mr Yea and the Bwin board discreetly polled about half of the company’s shareholders and he said there had been an even split in preference between GVC’s offer and an improved offer from 888 , made last weekend. \nBut strong support from Henderson Global Investors and Androsch Privatstiftung, the investment arm of Hannes Androsch, the former Austrian vice-chancellor, had tipped the balance. Together, the two companies own 9.1 per cent of Bwin’s shares. \n“We had a significant block of shares that was happy to support the board,” said Mr Yea. “On that basis, you cannot please all the shareholders and we hope that they will support us because it is in these circumstances that you need the board to show leadership.” \nGVC’s offer is a 45 per cent premium on Bwin’s closing share price on May 14, the day before the gaming company said it was in talks over a sale. It is also 13 per cent higher than 888’s improved bid. \nMr Yea said the GVC offer was more compelling not only in terms of price but also in ease of integration. GVC will migrate its customers on to Bwin’s software platform and safeguard Bwin’s software development operations. \nMuch of Bwin’s middle management will remain at the combined group. But there will be at least €125m of cost savings annually by the end of 2017, the two companies pledged, and Mr Yea said there would be staff cuts. \n888 had proposed switching Bwin’s customers to its software platform, a challenge that the Bwin board was wary of after conducting several platform changes after the merger of Bwin with PartyGaming. \nKenny Alexander, the chief executive of GVC, said he had been confident of winning the bid after hearing that 888’s improved offer had still fallen short on price. \n“It has been a long drawn out process,” he said. “I knew they had to raise their price, but when I heard rumours that we were still ahead I was very confident. I thought it was a level playing field after we took away the complexities [of a previous joint bid with Amaya, the Canadian gambling company] and satisfied their concerns. I thought the higher price would win.” \nHe said he had celebrated with a quiet dinner with some friends. “It was not rock and roll,” he said. \nMr Alexander also said that GVC’s remuneration policy, which would have awarded him and two other directors a combined £47.5m over the next two years, will be changed. \n“We will be completely aligned with shareholders,” he said. “We will have a salary and options and if we don’t create value we don’t get anything. Our directors have also put in £11m in the equity placing so we have a lot of skin in the game. This is a different organisation, and a bigger organisation.” \nRob Giles, a fund manager at Henderson, said he had amassed a 5 per cent stake in Bwin in the past six months because he felt a combination with either 888 or GVC would create a company that could double its share price over the next three years. “In the end we plumped for GVC because of the price and because an integration with 888 would have been slower and a lot less seamless,” he said.
