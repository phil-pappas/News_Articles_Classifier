Not a beach or infinity pool in sight: The photographer who... Truly novel tourist attractions! Inside the world's most... ‘Dangerous is a relative term in Somalia. Ordinary mishaps can be dangerous in Somalia, and by the same token what we consider dangerous is routine, such as hearing AK47s at night.’\nDespite the high threat of terrorism or violence, he didn’t encounter any major problems during the two-day trip, although there were some tense moments when the guide’s car broke down.\nMr Ogden said: ‘Our car stalled at one point in the middle of a marketplace intersection, which is a major security concern because we are sitting ducks.\n‘Our guards surrounded the car and ordered everyone else to keep moving, and they pushed the car out of the intersection and got it started again.’\nOne of the stops on Untamed Borders' itinerary is Mogadishu Cathedral, which is in ruins after decades of fighting in the capital\nHolidaymakers visit landmarks such as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (pictured) and the national football stadium\nThe wreckage of Belarusian plane that was shot down over Mogadishu, killing 11 people, is still on the streets eight years later\nHolidaymakers who book the trip through Untamed Borders are offered a rare glimpse of life inside one of the most dangerous cities\nFew Western tourists have dared to visit Mogadishu in recent years due to civil war and the constant threat of terror attacks\nmore videos 1 2 3 Watch video Passengers use industrial-strength cling film to secure luggage\nWatch video Cattle take over Swiss streets for annual Alpabzug ceremony\nWatch video What to expect on the ultimate Moroccan surfing adventure\nWatch video Steph and Dom drink Bloody Marys on air and are escorted out\nWatch video Footage shows unborn baby wriggling inside its mum's belly\nWatch video Miracle baby Jaxon Buell shows off his walking and talking\nWatch video Cereal Killer cafe staff phone for help during protest\nWatch video Pedestrian pinned against wall after near-fatal bus crash\nWatch video Terrified campers flee as huge sinkhole opens up in Queensland\nWatch video Aerial vision shows extent of the sinkhole on QLD beach\nWatch video Kris Jenner breaks down going through Bruce's old clothes\nWatch video First H&M ad which has Muslim model in a hijab\nThe night before he flew out of Somalia the country’s government was tipped off about an imminent terror attack, with the airport being the most likely target, he said.\nSet on the Indian Ocean, Mogadishu went into lockdown and the military presence doubled as authorities worked to stop the attack.\nMr Ogden said: ‘All the intersections had security checkpoints, there were tanks patrolling the main roads. We got into the airport after a lot of security and took off fine, but during my layover I checked the Somali news and learned that they had caught a car bomb trying to get into the airport, and the thwarted the attack, luckily.’\nFew Western tourists dare to visit Mogadishu, with terror groups making repeated threats against Westerners and those working for Western organisations.\nIn addition to seeing the sights, holidaymakers are able to interact with locals (pictured: a tourist receives a wet shave at a barber shop)\nA holidaymaker plays a game of football with local men on a beach in Mogadishu; guests pay £900 (excluding airfare) to visit the city\nTourists are taken to a number of attractions, including bustling markets, where they can watch fishermen gut their catch\nHolidaymakers who have been on the trip say it was an eye-opening experience that allowed them to see Mogadishu's positive sides\nBut Mr Ogden said his visit was more than worth it, as he was able to tour bustling markets, bullet-scarred buildings, picturesque beaches, and sights such as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the national stadium, the crumbling Italian colonial waterfront, and Mogadishu’s iconic lighthouse.\nHe said: ‘I really enjoyed the serenity of Jazeera Beach, a bit south of Mogadishu. It was a nice chance to interact with the handful of local fishermen there, something that isn't nearly as possible in Mogadishu itself.\n‘You cannot stay in one location more than a few minutes, and in some locations you cannot get out of the vehicle.\n‘Another great experience I had was when I went out at night to get my haircut once, which was a great time to hang out with the barber and in a small way support a local business.’\nMogadishu's crumbling Italian colonial waterfront and a harbour filled with fishing boats is one of the stops on the itinerary\nHolidaymakers travel in small groups of one to three people and are accompanied by four armed guards at all times\nMike Ogden said one of his favourite experiences was visiting the city's stunning coastline and speaking to local fishermen\nWhen it’s time to eat, guests are taken to local restaurants, where they dine on everything from lobster to camel burgers.\nIt may be the most dangerous organised tour in the world, but those such as Mr Ogden, who have accepted the risk and become one of the few tourists that locals will ever meet, say they were left with lasting memories and a new take on the war-torn capital.\nMr Ogden added: ‘Ranking a trip is difficult. I have been to about 40 countries and people ask me all the time which is my favourite.\n‘There isn't really a strict answer, but I do have to say that the resilience of the Somali people and the belief that they will have continuous peace some day is a stronger passion than I have ever seen before in others.’\nWestern tourists draw curious stares from locals, who are not used to seeing foreigners visiting the sights in the capital\nUntamed Borders said is only takes small groups because 'big groups create a greater footprint and a greater target'\nThe travel firm ran its first trip to Mogadishu in 2012, a year after the African Union liberated the capital from Al-Shabaab militants\nHolidaymakers spend just a few minutes in some locations or don't even exit the vehicle in some spots (pictured: a guard's firearm)\nAlthough the city lacks conventional tourist attractions, Untamed Borders ran its first trip to Mogadishu in 2012, a year after the African Union liberated the capital from the Al-Shabaab militant group, which is aligned with Al-Qaeda.\nThe travel firm has guided six trips this year on a request basis, and may be the only firm offering organised tours.\nCo-founder Kausar Hussain said: ‘We have not met any others. There are people that arrange travel and logistics for journalists and development workers in Mogadishu but I think we are the only company that advertises commercial trips for non-business visitors.\n‘We take a maximum of three people per trip for security reasons. Big groups create a greater footprint and a greater target.’\nGuests are accompanied by a translator and given opportunities to interact with locals, but less so than on other trips offered by Untamed Borders due to the heightened state of security.\nGuests are accompanied by a translator and given opportunities to interact with locals, including fishermen and beach vendors\nUntamed Borders said visitors find that Mogadishu is starting to find its feet after decades of war (pictured: Tomb of the Unknown Soldier)\nThe travel company has guided six trips this year on a request basis, and may be the only firm offering organised tours\nHolidaymakers get a first-hand look at the devastation of war when they visit Mogadishu's scarred buildings and ruins\nMr Hussain said: ‘When out and about in the city the security guards mean that interaction is less than we would like.\n‘However we ensure that the guests also spend time in places that are secure where they can mingle.\n‘There are not all that many foreigners seen in Mogadishu so the guests are a bit of a novelty. The overwhelming reaction is positive.’\nMr Hussain said guests are able to see positive sides to Mogadishu and leave with a different perspective.\nHe added: ‘They see that Somalia is not just a failed state. There is a positivity to modern Somalia, slowly starting to find its feet after decades of war. They also see some amazing things.\n‘For example, most people use phone banking for paying all their bills and often buy goods by transferring their mobile phone balance to the vendor’s phone.\n‘In this country where mobile connections are quite good but the banking system and finance systems are still bad they are probably the world's first cashless economy.’\nRead more: Untamed Borders - Adventure travel", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1RbdemR", "http://www.untamedborders.com/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2015-09-28T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T15:27:09.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
