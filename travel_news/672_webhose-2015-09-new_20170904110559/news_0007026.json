This further check-in innovation, which is introduced today, enables the traveller to obtain all the flight documents they need at home, and thus minimize their waiting times at their departure airport.\nTravellers departing from Zurich on SWISS who check in online via swiss.com can now print out not only their boarding pass but also the tags for their registered baggage in the comfort of their home. The new option, which was introduced today, will save the traveller further valuable time at their airport of departure.\nThe print-at-home baggage tag option is now available for any SWISS flight from Zurich, including onward connections (but excluding codeshare flights). SWISS is the first network airline to extensively offer its customers this convenient travel option. All existing baggage allowances remain unchanged.\nThe new facility enables the traveller to print out up to four baggage tags during the web check-in process. They also receive an additional confirmation of these, along with their boarding pass. So when they arrive at their airport of departure, the customer will already have all the documents they need for their coming flight.\nThe new print-at-home baggage tags are produced in A4 format, and can then be folded and inserted into a transparent plastic pouch (see picture) which is attached to the bag. The pouches are available free of charge at any SWISS airport desk, and can be re-used for all future flights. On arrival at the airport, the registered and tagged baggage can then be handed in either at the self-service bag drop machine if this is available (e.g. in Geneva) or at any staffed bag drop desk.\nFurther expansion planned to inbound Zurich flights\nThe new print-at-home baggage tag option should now be further extended to SWISS flights inbound to Zurich. This will initially be done for all SWISS services from the USA, followed by other stations outside the European Union. The facility is already available – also from today – for flights to Zurich from New York JFK and Moscow. For its Swiss-bound flights from points in EU member countries, SWISS is currently working with IATA and the relevant authorities to secure the requisite legal foundations.\nThe new print-at-home baggage tag option has already been offered at Geneva since 18 August. The facility is currently available for all SWISS flights from Geneva, and for selected inbound flights to Geneva from points including New York JFK, Pristina, Marrakech, Skopje and (since 25 August) Moscow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-01T17:59:57.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
