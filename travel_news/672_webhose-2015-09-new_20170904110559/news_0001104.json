Formerly known as Therme Hotel & Spa, the resort has been renamed 7132 Hotel, 7132 being the postal code of Vals. \n\n7123 has picked a controversial design by American architect Thom Mayne of Morphosis for its new tower: a startlingly slender 381m tall building with 107 rooms – virtually one room per floor – with a transparent exterior sheen that will mirror the mountains. If all goes well, it will open in 2019. \n\nBut first, the company has to win the votes of the community for the tower. A gallery with large-scale models and full details is being set up at 7132 Hotel and will be open for local community viewing in October, said Sonia Dietrich, managing director of the hotel. \n\nMeanwhile, renovations at the existing hotel, which comprises a main wing and another wing called Selva House, were completed last month. The latter, renamed House of Architects, now fields 13 new rooms designed by Kuma and 18 new rooms by Ando, both highly skilled at deflecting a 20m 2 space with their eye-popping minimalist design and unique effects. For instance, Kuma uses warm, curved wooden panels to create a soft cocoon of a room, while Ando sliced a triangle off a rectangular space for the bathroom. \n\nMorphosis’ Mayne is also designing another 20 rooms which will be ready by summer 2016, revealed Dietrich. \n\nThese new rooms join 20 retro-chic rooms designed by Peter Zumthor – the original Swiss architect behind the hotel – and its famous thermal springs spa, completing the concept to offer designer rooms in the House of Architects. \n\nIn the main building, three new 90m2 suites designed by Kuma have also opened. Each suite booking comes with a helicopter or a limousine at the guest's disposal in case he spontaneously wants to lunch in Geneva, shop in Zurich, whatever takes his fancy, at the rate of 2,480 francs (US$2,562) per night. \n\nThe 35 Zumthor rooms in the main building – larger at 24-30m 2 compared with those in the House of Architects (18-20m2) and more luxuriously furnished – have also been spruced up, with new bathrooms designed by Kuma. \n\nA new meditation park, Valser Path, to be opened to hotel guests and the public, is also being designed by Ando. It is scheduled for completion in 2017. Both the park and the new tower are within the hotel complex, which sits above the town centre and blends quietly into the natural surroundings. \n\nDietrich said the main difference since the new ownership came onboard was that, “for the first time since 30 years, we have the vision, plans and money to invest”. \n\n“It is now difficult for Switzerland to get good guests because the Swiss franc is strong. You can’t build a three-star hotel, you need something unique to compete. We have to go this way,” she said. \n\nShe believes the changes at 7132 Hotel will draw more top-paying guests who love architecture and design, thermal springs, top-notch service and F&B (one of the restaurants is helmed by Sven Wassmer who previously worked for Michelin-star chef Nenad Mlinarevic) and a destination that does not attract mass tourism. \n\nProspects from Asia are good, she said. “Even though there aren’t a lot of Asian guests at the moment, it might improve in time with the Japanese architects’ involvement. Most of the Asian guests we have are FITs from South Korea, Japan and China, and their main reason for coming here is the therme, the architecture and a desire to enjoy unspoilt areas of Switzerland,” Dietrich said. \n\nPrices have increased following the renovations and rates have been simplified: 390 francs for rooms in the House of Architects and 590 francs for rooms in the main building. \n\n– Read the full report in the next issue of TTG Asia Luxury , December 1, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-22T09:46:30.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
