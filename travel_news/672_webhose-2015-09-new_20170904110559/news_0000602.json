New research shows that these tablets may not be effective in doing anything to slow mental decline. According to a new survey, there is no evidence as to this. Studying 4,000 people, scientists have found little evidence that omega-3 supplement help us to maintain our brain power . Sardines and other oily fish are a rich source of omega-3 Photo: Andrew Crowley Tracking the patients over five years, they found that the group suffered decline at approximately the same rate, regardless of whether they had taken the supplements or not. Oily fish, such as sardines, have long been associated with healthy eating, but also with the power of reducing the risk of developing dementia. It has also been linked to better heart health and strong bones. But the part of fish that has been sold as the best for us is the omega-3 fatty acids. Public assumption has been that these acids, which are highly concentrated in the brain, were the cause of dietary benefits of fish. Omega-3 has been said to give your brain a boost Photo: PA According to this new research, which has been conducted by Harvard Medical School and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, fish oil supplements alone are insufficient to keep the brain young. While the search for effective dementia therapies continues, this is one that scientists are looking to rule out. Although this research might partially disprove the idea that omega-3 is not the solution, there are other foods that you can eat to keep your brain young. These include: Colourful fruits Berries, like blueberries and strawberries contain antioxidants to help your brain Photo: Alamy Veggies Mixing colourful vegetables into your diet will have anti-inflammatory effects. Some of these include carrots, asparagus, and radishes Photo: Picasa Olive products Olive oil and olives themselves contain useful antioxidants, plus MUFA - 'healthy' fat, otherwise known as monounsaturated fatty acid Photo: Alamy Nuts You can enjoy almonds, cashews, pecans or other nuts in moderation to boost your antioxidant count Photo: Alamy telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T10:17:18.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
