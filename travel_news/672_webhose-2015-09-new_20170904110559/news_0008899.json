This survey and service is being conducted entirely free of charge and we would like to invite every state tourist board, regional tourism organisation and commercially-minded golf course to get on board.” \n\nThe results of the survey will be published at the 8th IAGTO North America Golf Tourism Convention (NAC), taking place at Pinehurst Resort, NC, from 26-29 June 2016. \n\nPeter Walton, IAGTO’s Chief Executive, is inviting all tourist boards, however small their golf destination, along with their golf courses, hotels and DMCs to attend NAC next year. He said: “Not only will the NAC be their chance to meet with over 100 golf tour operators from 25 countries, all selling golf vacations to the US, but it will double up next year as an educational forum helping every golf destination in the US find the most effective ways to develop international golf tourism.” \n\nTourist boards and golf courses already signed up and participating in the National Golf Tourism Survey are from 20 states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Colorado, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Alabama, Oregon, Washington State, Montana, Maine, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia and Hawaii.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T17:23:02.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
