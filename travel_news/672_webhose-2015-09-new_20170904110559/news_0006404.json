The congress broke yet another record in attendance and we are proud to have brought together so many delegates from all over the world to discuss the latest research.”\nIsabel Bardinet, CEO of ESC, added: “London and ExCeL have completely delivered on our expectations. Never in the history of the ESC Congress have we had such a well-attended event. London has been a fantastic host city and ExCeL, based on feedback by participants, has delivered the best layout the congress has ever had. It is evident that the delegates have enjoyed being at the venue. A congress can’t work unless the city, the venue and the organiser work in partnership and I’m delighted that the partnership between ESC, London & Partners and ExCeL has been so strong – it’s even difficult to tell the teams apart, as they’ve worked together as one, to deliver a great event.”\nJames Rees, Executive Director, ExCeL London, said: “The decision to build and open London’s first International Convention Centre in 2010 was made with the specific desire to host events of this magnitude and the huge numbers they need to accommodate. The way ESC used the venue was truly spectacular and ExCeL’s flexible design allowed delegates and exhibitors to meet and interact in such a way that feedback has described the venue layout as the best the Congress has ever had. In what is our busiest ever year for conferences, staging the ESC Congress has helped to further cement our reputation as a home of world leading events.”\nBecky Graveney, Head of Associations at London & Partners, added: “It was a privilege to see the ESC Congress come together so successfully in London. The city truly embraced the event, with the London Heart Trail from Tower Bridge to London Eye promoting the importance of heart health and well-being to visitors and Londoners alike. The culmination of course was the record-breaking delegate numbers and the £100million in economic benefit the event brought to London. The cardiology congress is the meetings world equivalent of the Olympics, and ESC was a gold-medal winning event for everyone involved.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T02:46:02.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
