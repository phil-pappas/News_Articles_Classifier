Story highlights The limited edition set of the stored value cards seem wildly popular But they've also drawn criticism from the public, particularly among parents EasyCard apologized and said the cards would only be sold via a phone line (CNN) A cautionary tale for public transport officials around the world who might be considering using adult film stars to spice up their marketing plans. A set of sexy pre-paid swipe cards featuring Japanese adult video star Yui Hatano has proven to be both popular and controversial in Taipei. The drama all started August 26, when Taiwanese card producer EasyCard announced that it had teamed up with the popular actress for a limited edition set of the stored value cards, used to pay for rides on the city's metro and buses and small convenience store purchases. According to the Taipei Times , the move drew much criticism from the public, particularly among parents, educators and women's advocacy groups. Some critics -- including Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je , whose government holds 40% of the swipe card company -- complained that the cards would be available at major convenience store chains, making them easily accessible to children. In a statement posted on its website, EasyCard apologized for the controversy and said the cards would only be sold via a phone line. Online images of the set show two versions of the stored value cards -- an \"Angel\" and a \"Demon.\" There is no nudity in either image, one of which features Hatano wearing white, the other black. Cards sold out in four hours Controversy aside, it would appear some have no problems carrying around Hatano's image in their wallets. On September 1, EasyCard announced the 15,000 available cards had already sold out by 4:18 a.m. local time, just four hours after phone lines opened. All of the proceeds from the cards, priced at NT$500 a set, are being donated to charity, said the company. According to English-language news site Focus Taiwan , a \"Purchase Yui Hatano EasyCards\" Facebook campaign drew approximately 47,000 members. Many fans complained the phone line was constantly busy. \"This was the first time I wanted to contribute to charity this much, but not even a single phone call got through,\" said one fan, as quoted by Focus Taiwan.
