The charity was set up as a result of the earthquake with the realisation that long term support would be required well into the future, and that's what we will continue to do.\"A Summer Ball held at the weekend raised a mammoth £11,000 and Ant said so many other people were still contacting them to help out or make donations.If anyone would like to make a donation or hold an event for the people of Nepal, they should use the Live The Adventure Nepal Appeal site on www.justgiving.comOr for further information visit http://www.nepalappeal.com Valere TjolleSpecial offers on sustainable tourism info HERE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T20:17:24.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
