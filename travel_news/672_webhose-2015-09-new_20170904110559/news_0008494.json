Angel Resmella has joined the venue in Chester Street, Aston, after working in the Spanish hospitality sector for almost 19 years. The 43-year-old, who is originally from Bilbao in Spain, started his career in the Canary Islands where he trained with international hotel brand RIU Hotels & Resorts. \nHe joined Louvre Hotels Group, which owns the Campanile Hotel brand, in 2004 and has worked as general manager at Campanile Hotel Alicante and Campanile Hotel Madrid. Angel speaks fluent Spanish, English, German, French and Basque which is the native language of Bilbao. He said: “Although I have previously worked within the Campanile brand there are many operational differences between the various countries. “It is the first time I have managed a hotel in the UK and I am looking forward to applying all that I have learnt in the Spanish hospitality sector to my new role. “Campanile Hotel Birmingham already has a number of strategies and objectives in place to help to strengthen and promote its services in the local area so my focus will be to continue this work and ensure all of our customers receive the best possible service. “Since arriving in Birmingham I have enjoyed exploring the city and have found that it has a similar history to Bilbao with lots of tourist attractions and a thriving retail and food and drinks market. “I am also looking forward to my partner and chocolate Labrador Brownie joining me at the hotel in October and to establishing more connections in the city.” Campanile Hotel Birmingham was set-up in 1999 to meet a growing demand for leisure and business accommodation in the area. Emmanuelle Le Roux, of Louvre Hotels Group, said: “Angel has worked within Campanile Hotels for more than a decade and we are confident he will be able to strengthen the business by bringing fresh new ideas to the hotel. “He is looking forward to immersing himself in Birmingham’s tourism sector and identifying new opportunities for further growth.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-04T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T13:39:19.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
