Carly Ledbetter Associate Lifestyle Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 09/10/2015 11:23 AM EDT | Edited: 38 minutes ago \nWhen staying at a hotel, room safes are really the only option for protecting the valuables you've packed. But if you thought those safes were the best way for keeping your precious items secure, think again. \nThanks to a new YouTube demonstration from Jim Stickley, a cyber security expert, one can see just how easy it is to break into a hotel safe. Using simple tools and a paper clip-like object, Stickley easily opens the safe (without knowing the code) in less than two minutes. \n\"People often think the room itself is secure, said Stickley in an interview with The Huffington Post. \"They know that the cleaning crew may have access but think that is a low risk especially if they use the hotel room safe. The reality is that gaining access to a persons hotel room is not difficult.\" \n\"The video demonstrates that a person with the right combination of skill, tools, and desire can circumvent a hotel safe,\" said Chris McGoey, a security expert who runs McGoey Security Consulting, in an email correspondence with The Huffington Post. \"Most hotel employees, other than maintenance or security staff, do not possess such skill or the desire to break into safes for a living. In the event that someone outside the hotel wants to break in, McGoey added that Stickley doesn't discuss how that person would actually get inside the hotel room. \n\"I advise people who travel to keep important items or things of value with you, use the office safe, or leave them at home,\" said McGoey, adding that travelers should keep the below points in mind: Hotel safes provide only a minimum level of security for your valuables. Hotel safes are a step above hiding your valuables in your luggage, in a drawer, or in clothing. Hotel safes are often not secured to the wall or closet enclosure very well. Hotel safes are not recommended for things of great value, importance, or one-of-a-kind items. Hotel safes have a limit of liability attached to their use should something of value be stolen. Hotels usually have a more secure safes in the office if you ask. \nFollow these great tips and you'll travel safely every time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T19:13:41.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
