At 1 p.m. on a recent Sunday, some 50 people — tan, toned, nearly naked, mostly blond — lounged around the infinity pool on the rooftop terrace of Soho House, an eight-story, curving, symmetrical Bauhaus structure that once housed the Politburo of the Communist East German government. They sipped rose-tinted cocktails and chatted in that fluttery, moneyed way that brings to mind Daisy Buchanan in “The Great Gatsby.” Dilapidated Soviet-era tower blocks rose behind them, phantomlike, in the distance. Perched awkwardly on the pool’s edge drinking a Pimm’s Cup, I watched two Heidi Klum-esque young mothers in bikinis pass an American Spirit cigarette back and forth, intermittently misting themselves with a shimmery substance; on a nearby lounger, three sandy-haired 20-somethings in Panama hats huddled over a MacBook, giggling and clinking glasses of iced Champagne. Preposterously, Janis Joplin wafted in over the sound system.

It certainly didn’t feel like a Berlin where unemployment still tops 10 percent and the average resident earns less than 20,000 euros (approximately $22,000) per year even as housing costs rise at unprecedented levels. What I was observing was another Berlin, that marginal but growing, high-rolling sliver of the German capital that I’d set out to infiltrate. My mission was to spend $2,000 in 24 hours in a city known for its wealth of history and culture but of not much else, a city that’s “poor but sexy,” as the endlessly parroted unofficial motto goes. So what happens when you take away half of that equation? My first stop was lunch at Pauly Saal , a Michelin-starred German restaurant by the team behind the local beau monde mainstays Grill Royal and King Size Bar. Pauly Saal is part of the Ehemalige Jüdische Mädchenschule , a high-end arts and dining complex that opened three years ago on the refurbished site of a Jewish girls’ school that had been seized by the Nazis. Lunch was served on milk-white tablecloths in the restaurant’s leafy cobblestone courtyard between the red brick walls of the former school. The 60-euro ($66, at $1.10 to the euro) four-course prix fixe lunch started with a ceviche of mackerel served with several kinds of radishes, edible flowers, polenta chips and small globs of an avocado mixture, and a too-sweet yellow concoction that our otherwise competent waitress could only explain as an “Arabic fruit jelly.” Next came pan-fried cod with green peas, carrots, beans and char. The cod was served with more edible flowers and mystery globs, as was the next course, entrecôte served in a soy-heavy reduction on brioche with root vegetables, mustard seed and gremolata. Dessert — grand cru chocolate with raspberry and anise — arrived mercifully glob-and-flower-free. Everything was good, if repetitive, coming in at just over 100 euros with wine, water and tip — pricey for Berlin but hardly making a dent in my budget.

But few doubt that its art scene is world-class. So what is the high-end approach on that front? My fanciest friend, Marie, suggested I get in touch with Niche Art and Architecture Tours , a company founded in 2009 by three local art historians that offers visitors “an authentic Berlin experience” through customized tours. They asked what I’d like to see on my three-hour expedition, which costs 250 euros (but can get pricier with add-ons like a chauffeur). I asked for their most representative lineup, expecting a rarefied twirl through Berlin’s exclusive blue-chip gallery scene. Imagine, then, my surprise when my guide, Nele, asked me to meet her at Kottbusser Tor, the Kreuzberg U-Bahn station best known for its resident addicts and drunks (and the syringe dispensary built into its foundation). I know this, because for the last seven years I’ve lived right around the corner. Nele, a pixieish blonde in a minimalist cobalt dress and matching mascara, took me to the top of Zentrum Kreuzberg, a mammoth tower block complex built in the ’70s as part of an ambitious social modernization project. To make way for the structure, the developers, in cooperation with the city government, razed full blocks of 19th-century apartments, evicting the tenants. Residents rose up in protest and occupied many of the yet-undemolished buildings, giving birth to the Kreuzberg squatter scene of the ’70s and ’80s. Meanwhile, the Zentrum project languished. Construction costs mounted, and what was supposed to be a shining model of futuristic urban planning became a crime- and drug-addled emblem of social decay. Nele walked me through the Zentrum’s narrow corridors and rundown modernist alleyways, explaining how the new management company has taken measures to revitalize the complex — locking the doors at night, for instance, and painting the walls pink, the color least welcoming to graffiti. We turned a corner to see several teenagers freebasing behind a stairwell. Zentrum Kreuzberg is a mainstay of the Niche lineup, its seedy strangeness apparently a plum attraction for well-heeled visitors to Berlin. “An authentic Berlin experience,” it seems, can begin to resemble slum tourism.

Credit Andreas Meichsner for The New York Times After a visit to the studio of a local artist, Sarah Schoenfeld, who makes digital prints on shaman cloaks and melts down drugs to use as paint, we walked to König Galerie , an interdisciplinary gallery housed in an impressive ’60s-era Brutalist-style Catholic church called St. Agnes. We were shown around by the director Gregor Hose, who was friendly and knowledgeable enough, but who could have spoken more quietly as we stood behind a frustrated cluster of people trying to watch a video installation by Ragnar Kjartansson and the band The National. The gallery’s namesake himself, Johann König, was there, but private tour or not, no introduction was imminent. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story After so much art talk, I was more than ready to head to the Spa de Rome , part of the Hotel de Rome, housed in a 19th-century building that once served as East Germany’s State Bank. The spa is in what was once the bank’s vault, and gold leaf mosaics on the walls mark where it once held its gold deposits. My lineup of treatments included a full-body massage, an hourlong facial and something called the Tropical Hawaiian Essence, which involves being scrubbed at length with a mix of organic Hawaiian noni, gotu kola, green papaya and kava kava. Buffed to a sheen, I headed to the spa deck for a snack and a cocktail. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story One roof over on the hotel’s restaurant terrace, immaculately groomed guests dressed for that night’s “White Party” were dining to a live lounge rendition of Lykke Li’s “I Follow Rivers.” The terrace overlooks Bebelplatz, the square where the Nazis held their mass book burning in 1933. I paid my ludicrous (but maybe worth it?) 500-euro spa bill and headed to dinner at Crackers , the latest upscale restaurant in Berlin to emerge out of a storied former nightclub — in this case, Cookies, which moved locations six times in nearly 20 years before shutting down for good in 2014. Crackers occupies the club’s final location, in back of the Westin Grand on Friedrichstrasse. As with many of Berlin’s club-cum-restaurants trading somehow on the city’s underground club culture, you have to buzz an unmarked entrance and cross through a darkened alleyway to reach it. You then walk through the kitchen and finally enter into the vast, airy dining room, where the tables sit on a raised platform over what was once the dance floor, and loud electronic music is pumped in, courtesy of a live D.J.

Meanwhile, the restaurant was filling with 30- and 40-something specimens of that populous Berlin breed of formerly hard-partying creative industry types whose ascension into relative affluence has paralleled that of the city itself. Let’s call them the post-raver bourgeoisie. After paying my 130-euro bill, it was time for the last stop that evening, a foray into Berlin’s strange, incongruous world of luxury night life, something that seems perfectly indigenous to London or New York, but feels absurd here, where the clubs everyone tends to talk and write about (the prime example being Berghain) are gritty, industrial and known to refuse entry to anyone who looks too expensively turned out. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T14:16:53.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
