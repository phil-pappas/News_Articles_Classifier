Partnering for a fourth straight year, Bisimoto's \"Brute Ute\" will be revealed at Hyundai's SEMA press conference on November 3 at 11:30 a.m. PT , in Las Vegas .\nUtilizing Hyundai's 2.4-liter \"Theta-II\" power plant as the starting point for the build, similar to last year's 2015 Sonata , Bisimoto mated strengthened internals with fast-burning flex-fuel, a high-boost turbocharger and an upgraded engine management system to put down more than 700 horsepower to the wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission. This rendition of the 2016 Tucson was built with the ultimate vision of packing world-beating performance and technology into a brand-new, unexpected vehicle platform.\n\"The 2016 Tucson was the perfect platform for this year's build, offering me the opportunity to captivate a wider audience by tapping into the growing popularity of the CUV market,\" said Bisi Ezerioha , owner and chief engineer, Bisimoto Engineering. \"After hundreds of hours of testing and developing new engine components, we're confident that this power plant can handle what we're asking from it, delivering a fresh, race-bred take on the 2016 Tucson with performance and reliability at its core.\"\nComplementing the absurd power figures, Bisimoto gave the exterior a very clean \"street fighter\" look, riding on custom air-ride suspension, white five-star race-spec wheels and sticky, R-compound rubber. A custom roll cage hints to the vehicle's performance credentials, and the signature Bisimoto look is rounded-out with the elimination of the front grille, replaced with a huge intercooler to cool the incoming air.\nFollow #HyundaiSEMA to keep up to speed on all of this year's SEMA activity.\nPOWERTRAIN MODIFICATIONS:\nAEM Electronics Infinity 6 ECU Boost controller and Fuel Pressure Regulator Arias 9:1 compression Pistons ARP Head Studs and Bolts Bisimoto Springs and Titanium Retainers Bisimoto Level 2.4 Camshaft Bisimoto 360 degree Oil Cap Bisimoto Custom Exhaust System 2200cc Injectors Golden Eagle Sleeves & Intake Bisimoto MLS Gasket Bisimoto Intake Heat Shielding Gasket High-Flow Fuel Pump NGK Iridium Spark Plugs PurÖl \"Elite Series\" Synthetic Motor Oils PurÖl MTF Transmission Fluid Port Flow Custom Headwork Kinsler Fuel Rail & Filter Bisimoto Steel Rods Custom Mil-Spec Harness Turbonetics BTX-6465 Billet Turbo Wastegate Blowoff Valve Spearco Intercooler Vibrant Vanjen Clamps and Stainless Steel Hardware Turbo Hot Header Coatings Spec Stage 5 Clutch CHASSIS/SUSPENSION MODIFICATIONS\nfifteen52 TARMAC R43 19x8.5 Wheels Buddy Club 4-Pot Big Brake Kit and Lug Nuts Bisimoto Brake Mounts Toyo R888 Tires Air Ride Equipment Airbag Suspension EXTERIOR MODIFICATIONS\nDenmatic Design Scheme Bisimoto Custom Grille Insert Hyundai Genuine Equipment Mud Flaps Rhythms Powder Coating Driftmotion Aluminum Piping INTERIOR MODIFICATIONS\nBisimoto 4-Point Roll Cage Harman Kardon Infinity Sound System Equipped with HD Radio Infinity Audio System Front Doors: Kappa 60.11cs 6-1/2\" Two-Way Component System Rear Doors: Kappa 62.11i 6-1/2\" Two-Way Loudspeaker System Cargo Space Speakers: Kappa 62.11i 6-1/2\" Two-Way Loudspeaker System (Reference 1200S Shallow Mount Subwoofers) Amplification: Kappa K5 five-channel 650 Watt Amplifier Head Unit: JBL Legend CP100 Connected Car Receiver Racepak IQ3 Dash Bisimoto Reservoir Socks Buddy Club Short shifter G&J Braided Plumbing Buddy Club Racing Seat Custom Euro-inspired Leather Interior HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA\nHyundai Motor America, headquartered in Fountain Valley, Calif. , is a subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Co. of Korea.
