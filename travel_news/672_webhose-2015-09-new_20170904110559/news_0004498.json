Best suited to a group – of friends or family – that wants to combine some stay-put days with forays into inland Norfolk or Suffolk, or longer days out to the coast. Manor Farm is fairly isolated; rural surroundings mean that a car is recommended and, as with many other Landmark Trust properties, there’s no television, WiFi or reliable phone signal. Facilities are on the basic side, but the historic atmosphere and unique character of the property make it a good choice for a reunion or a special celebration. Location: 7/10 Manor Farm, Pulham Market, Norfolk Photo: Landmark Trust Eighteen miles south of Norwich and close to the Suffolk border, Manor Farm is part of a small rural hamlet, set in a flat, open countryside of cultivated fields and quiet backroads. The nearest village, Pulham Market, is a just over a mile away and has a pub, a medieval church and thatched cottages. Southwold and the Suffolk coast, Bury St Edmunds and Thetford are within a hour's drive and the property makes a good base for cycling or walking holidays. Style/character: 9/10 Dating from around 1597, the house has been beautifully restored with exposed beams, pamment flooring, antique furnishing, wooden room partitions and traditional window shutters. There are two open fireplaces which guests are welcome to use (fuel is available locally) and the overall feel is relaxed and welcoming. Manor Farm, Pulham Market, Norfolk Photo: Landmark Trust There are plenty of comfortable sofas and easy chairs in the sitting room and a long, polished dining table in the low-ceilinged, beamed living area. A large, grassy garden, spacious parking area and three bathrooms make it a good choice for groups. Dogs are welcome. Facilities: 6/10 The kitchen is on the small side with electric cooker, microwave and dishwasher, and a small central table. Information on local sights and the history of the property is provided for guests. Manor Farm, Pulham Market, Norfolk Photo: Landmark Trust The visitor’s books, which go back over many years, provide very useful tips and restaurant recommendations. There are deck chairs but no outdoor eating space or barbecue. The bathrooms are adequate rather than state-of-the-art, two with old-fashioned, large baths and one with a shower (of the trickling rather than power-shower variety). Value for money: 7/10 From £772 per week in low season; rising to £1,501 in high. Cheaper three- or four-night breaks are available out of peak season. Family-friendly: 7/10 Best for families with children aged between five and 12 years. Teenagers may feel isolated here and steep stairs may be hazardous for toddlers. Eating Best for food supplies is Goodies Food Hall ( goodiesfoodhall.co.uk ) and the nearest pub is in Pulham Market Access for guests with disabilities There's a ground-floor twin bedroom and shower room, but these are not adapted. Stairs are steep and narrow.
