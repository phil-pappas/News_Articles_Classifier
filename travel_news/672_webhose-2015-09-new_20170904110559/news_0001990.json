Designed for today’s hyper-connected, tech-forward global traveler, Aloft continues to re-define the traditional hotel experience and strengthen its footprint in Europe. Owned and developed by the Schörghuber Corporate Group, both hotels offer a vibrant social scene in two of Germany’s most dynamic cities. \n“We’re thrilled to introduce the energy of the Aloft brand to the German market,” said Brian McGuinness, Global Brand Leader, Specialty Select Brands for Starwood. “We’re in the innovative mind-set of designing our hotels for the future traveler, and we’re thrilled to bring Aloft’s passion for design, music and technology to the spirited cities of Munich and Stuttgart.” \n“I would like to thank Arabella Hospitality SE for putting their trust again in Starwood and advancing the entry of Aloft in Germany with these two hotels,” said Michael Wale, President, Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Europe, Africa and Middle East. “Aloft meets Germany’s demand for mid-scale hotels in both urban and industrial areas that bring life, innovation and personality at a great value.” \nAloft Munich Hits a High Note \nIdeally located across the street from Hauptbahnhof, Munich’s central train station, Aloft Munich features 184 modern designed guest rooms and 96 square meters of dynamic meeting space across three Tactic Rooms. The hotel features a courtyard, perfect for lounging and mingling, in addition to Aloft’s signature WXYZ bar— the hottest destination to meet and mix over handcrafted cocktails and live music. \nThe hotel is steps away from world-famous beer destinations such as Hofbräuhaus and Theresienwiese, the official grounds of Oktoberfest, as well as Marienplatz. Other nearby local attractions include the shops on Maximilian Street, Pinakothek Museum, Viktualienmarkt and the Allianz Arena football stadium. Munich’s Franz Josef Strauss International Airport is an easy 45 min train ride. \nAloft Stuttgart Tops the Charts \nLocated in the heart of Stuttgart’s European Quarter as part of the Milaneo mixed-used development, Aloft Stuttgart features 165 spacious, loft-like rooms. Ideal for business meetings and social gatherings, the hotel has three Tactic Meeting rooms, each with 20 square metres of flexible meeting space. \nWithin walking distance, guests can reach the main railway station or visit the Schlossgarten, Stuttgart's famed 600 year old park. Attractions such as the Mercedes-Benz and Porsche Museums, Königstrasse, the central shopping street, the Old Castle and New Palace as well as Theodor-Heuss-Strasse, the city’s vibrant pub and club scene, are just a short tram ride away. \nWith design-led innovation in the brand’s DNA, both Aloft hotels will feature SPG Keyless, the hospitality industry’s first mobile, keyless entry system that allows guests to use their smart phone as a key. Additionally, both hotels— in addition to every Aloft Hotel around the world— will offer Live at Aloft Hotels, the brand’s signature ongoing music series that gives guests and music-loving locals free access to local emerging artists as well as some of the hottest bands at WXYZ bars. Other signature amenities at every Aloft hotel include Re:fuel, a one-stop gourmet grab & go food and beverage area, a 24-hour fitness center and fast & free WiFi. \nStar Search: Project Aloft Star Amplified by Rolling Stone \nTo celebrate its entry to Germany, the Aloft brand in Europe partnered with Rolling Stone Germany, earlier this summer, to host Project Aloft Star Amplified by Rolling Stone, a talent discovery competition aimed to identify and support the hottest emerging music artists. The winner will have the chance to give a live performance at the Aloft Munich and Aloft Stuttgart opening events in September, win a professional recording session for their winning song and its inclusion on the “New Noises” CD from Rolling Stone along other well-known brands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T03:50:20.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
