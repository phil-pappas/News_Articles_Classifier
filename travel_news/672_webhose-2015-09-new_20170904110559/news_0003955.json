School is where almost every top professional rugby player initially picked up and flung an oval ball, learnt about the ethos of the game – encompassing, as it does, inclusivity, teamwork and camaraderie – and felt the excited buzz of victory. And it is at that level the very best are flagged up as future heroes. Certain rugby schools become renowned for their ability to develop talent. For instance, Millfield, the alma mater of England captain Chris Robshaw and his current international teammates Mako Vunipola and Jonathan Joseph, is one which has earned such a venerated reputation. Indeed, other alumni include Welsh greats Sir Gareth Edwards and JPR Williams, who both attended the Somerset school in the 1960s. Another is Dulwich College, where recent England internationals Nick Easter and Andrew Sheridan attended. And success breeds success, as the adage goes. Last season the south-London school reached the final of the Under-18 NatWest Schools Cup, played on Twickenham’s hallowed turf. They lost 30-18 to Bromsgrove, and teenage tears of anguish flowed. To play at Twickenham as an 18-year-old, or younger, is the stuff dreams are made of But up until that point Dulwich had been unbeaten in 33 games, over three campaigns, in the most prestigious school rugby competition in England – little surprise that Premiership club sides send scouts to ensure they don’t miss out on the next Jonny Wilkinson or Martin Johnson. How long before some of the recent finalists make decent headway in the professional rugby world? As Matt Mullan, the England prop and a Bromsgrove old boy who attended the finale, says: “It's a big thing for those boys; to be able to play at Twickenham as an 18-year-old, or younger, is the stuff dreams are made of. You savour that as a professional, let alone as a schoolboy.” For most England-based players, the NatWest Schools Cup, which has four finals – the under-15 cup and vase, with the same two competitions at under-18 level – will provide their first experience of playing at an international ground. For most who run out it will be the one and only opportunity they will have to shine at such a venue, though for some it will spur their determination to reach the next level and beyond, as it did with Tom Croft, the former Lions flanker, who won the main competition with Oakham, a school which also produced ex-England skipper Lewis Moody. “To actually play at Twickenham at that point was what I thought would be the biggest game of my career,” says Croft, 29. “It was a massive day in my life. The bus rolled in and you've got all the school's supporters there – it's obviously on a slightly smaller scale than the England team, but it has a real feel about it. There were a lot of nerves before the game, and it ended 30-28. It was a down-to-the-wire game, which is obviously what you want in the final of the biggest cup competition.” Schoolboy rugby is taken incredibly seriously in Ireland, and regularly crowds of 3,000 or more attend fixtures at Blackrock College or Belvedere College in Dublin. In fact, many of the national team’s top players have featured in the Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup, which Blackrock (Ireland legend Brian O’Driscoll’s old school) has dominated having won 68 times. Luke Fitzgerald played for Ireland while still in his teens, though the winger who has recently been recalled to Joe Schmidt’s squad had long before been earmarked for greatness due to his success at schoolboy level with Blackrock. He won two Senior Cups, in 2004 and 2006, with international and Leinster teammate Cian Healy’s Belvedere College getting the better of his side in 2005. Early life lessons: schoolchildren can learn about teamwork through playing rugby Photo: Alamy “They were pretty big moments,” says Fitzgerald. “Probably the most special one was winning my school year with my friends, in 2006. That is something I will always treasure.” Prop Healy can vividly remember the match, which was the first title Belvedere had managed in 33 years. “The biggest crowd I experienced as a youngster was aged 17 at Landsdowne Road in that final, which we won 16-10. There were 22,000 watching that match.” When he has time Healy goes back to see how his old school’s side is getting on, and it’s appreciated by the young players, according to the front-rower’s old headmaster, Gerry Foley. He says of Healy: “He’s now like a god to the youngsters. It helps that he is very approachable and well liked.” Fitzgerald’s coach, Ray Ward, recalls how the winger showed a maturity and determination which was rare for a schoolboy of his age. “I remember Luke was a deep thinker,” he says. “He did a lot of thinking about where he was on the pitch and where others were. “He was bringing moves to training sessions and asking if we could see if they worked. None of the other guys was doing that. Luke had already developed his athleticism to the highest degree as a schoolboy and he'd already started thinking about the game, which was more than most would have done at that age. “In those days I never really got the feeling that Luke felt it was all about himself, which was great because it really was all about the team, the squad, and how far they could go. I think that was a big influence on him.” Healy, too, was ambitious, according to his coach, Stephen Gibbons. “When Cian was about 14 I asked him what team he wanted to be on,” he says of the former Irish youth champion in the shot put and discus. “He replied: ‘I want to play for Ireland.’ That always stuck with me – he was very driven.” Attending a school with a good reputation for rugby success may help young players rise to the top, though without possessing that inner drive such heights will not be reached. One thing is for sure: interest in rugby at schoolboy level has never been so high, either side of the Irish Sea. • Show your support for your home nation – use the hashtag #ScrumTogether and join the team effort to push them over the line on Twitter and at Dove Men+Care", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T22:13:57.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
