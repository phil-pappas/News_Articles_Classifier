She says the building owners have the right to ask the museum, which charges $21.95 for an adult ticket, to vacate the property if it doesn’t meet certain sales thresholds. \nThe building’s property manager, DTZ, declined to comment to The Washington Post (http://wapo.st/1KoYstq). \nVaccarello says the museum would search for other spaces in the area, or would look to partner with another organization to sell its paraphernalia.
