The growing GBTA Ladders program is in its third year of providing opportunities for those in the business travel industry to develop their talent and learn to better understand macro-level business travel issues.\nCo-founded in 2013 by Caitlin Gomez, senior director of Global Markets at HRG and Krissy Herman, vice president of Program Management at KesselRun Consulting, GBTA Ladders was designed to create an environment that facilitates the healthy exchange of ideas and invigorates interest in the business travel industry among the next generation of professionals.\n“We saw a great opportunity to help develop talent and provide members with access to thought leaders and prominent personalities from a variety of disciplines,” said Gomez. “But in order to succeed in business today, you need more than just a network. You also need help balancing work, life and continuing education while you focus on improving your business skills, achieving your career goals and developing a vital inner circle of colleagues. GBTA Ladders helps you learn how to do this.”\nGBTA Ladders places members into carefully crafted teams from a cross-section of the industry led by a highly-esteemed member of the corporate travel community who serves as the team mentor. The teams are given the assignment of building a compelling presentation around a current industry topic. The projects are presented to a team of judges and the winning team is awarded the opportunity to present at an education session during GBTA’s annual Convention.\nGBTA Ladders offers mentees an opportunity to develop their talents in multiple ways throughout the course of the program term. In addition to the project, GBTA Ladders held its first annual GBTA Ladders Summit in April of 2015. GBTA Ladders also provides educational components and forums for members from different industry segments to showcase their talents and skill sets to some of the industry’s key players.\nAs the GBTA Ladders Leadership Team looks to grow the program for the 2015-2016 term, it is looking for both travel veterans wishing to serve as mentors and coaches, as well as ambitious potential mentees looking for an opportunity to develop their talent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T18:34:04.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
