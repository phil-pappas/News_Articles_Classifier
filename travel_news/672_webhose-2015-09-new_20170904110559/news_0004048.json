Whether your idea of romance is a scenic hike or sharing a delicious meal, there's an off-the-beaten-path spot for the pair of you.\nCOEUR D'ALENE, IDAHO DO: Since this summer resort town (about 40 minutes from Spokane International Airport) quiets down in the fall, you two can enjoy the postcard-perfect sparkling lake, mountains, and lush green forest without the annoying crowds. Pack some layers, since fall temps can get as low as 35 degrees at night, but expect sunny days to get up to 72. Rent a bike (from $35; cdaadventures.com ) and ride a portion of the paved Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes, which passes through rolling farmlands and skirts the shorelines of Lake Coeur d'Alene for over 70 miles. Keep an eye out for wild turkey, deer, and moose. You can also ride the Centennial Trail, which hugs both the Spokane River and the lake, and make a stop at Higgens Point, a great place to spy eagles. Although the massive birds can be seen year-round, their numbers swell between November and January as they come to feast on the lake's salmon. To soak in views at a more leisurely pace, take a stroll on the world's longest floating boardwalk; you'll hover over the lake's surface for more than half a mile. And stop by the Art Spirit gallery in the downtown area to see paintings and sculptures from regional artists. In October, you can also check out the concerts, dance workshops, and more that are part of the annual Art From the Heart celebration.\nEAT: In the morning, hit The Garnet Café, a popular breakfast joint with delicious omelets. Later, find a cozy spot at The Cellar at 317 Sherman restaurant and wine bar, where you can listen to live blues (try the bouillabaisse or the bone-in pork rib eye, both terrific). And do not miss the wine-tasting machine, from which you can sample 24 regional varieties by the taste, half-glass, or full glass.\nSTAY: Greenbriar Inn (from $115; greenbriarlodging.com ) is a restored historic home with a martini bar that plays live music until 9 p.m. The Roosevelt Inn (from $110; therooseveltinn.com ), a 1905 schoolhouse turned B&B, offers a gourmet breakfast and comfy rooms with no TVs—so you two can focus on each other, not your usual third wheel, Olivia Pope.\nGREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA DO: This Southern city seems designed for couples: The variety of things to do will keep you both smiling—and provide conversation fodder for a long while. If you arrive early on Friday (the city conveniently has its own international airport), take a guided tour of the BMW factory ($20; open weekdays with reservations; bmwusfactory.com ), and covet the \"art cars\" at the adjoining museum. On Saturday, see the largest public collection of watercolors by the iconic American artist Andrew Wyeth (for free!) at the Greenville County Museum of Art. Then head to the Village of West Greenville, a historic mill town where more than 30 artists display their works. Get your outdoors on by hitting the Swamp Rabbit Trail, which hugs the Reedy River and goes past Falls Park, home to a pretty waterfall and a 355-foot pedestrian suspension bridge. Consider renting a bike (from $20; reedyrides.com ). End your day by sampling fancy moonshine and flavored whiskeys at Dark Corner Distillery ($4; darkcornerdistillery.com).\nEAT: Gastropub Bacon Bros. Public House makes a pimiento cheese dip topped with bacon jam that's pretty much Southern food nirvana. Also try their charcuterie, BBQ, and awesome cocktails. On Main Street, Sassafras Southern Bistro turns out huge portions of traditional South Carolina fare (shrimp and grits, anyone?) in an old cigar warehouse. Just brace yourself for the food coma.\nSTAY: Pettigru Place (from $140; pettigruplace.com ), a regal brick B&B downtown, has English gardens and a heavenly breakfast (ah, the gingerbread pancakes and Cajun poached eggs). For an Ikea–meets–Daniel Boone retreat, book a mod room at the Swamp Rabbit Inn ($150; swamprabbitinn.com). Cook your own breakfast with groceries that they supply—go ahead and tell people you roughed it.\nALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO\nDO: Known for its hot-air balloon fiesta that launches 600 basketed balloons into the sky each autumn (October 3 to 11), this desert town also happens to be the U.S. center of flamenco dancing. Start your Saturday with a lesson at the National Institute of Flamenco ($12; nationalinstituteofflamenco.org )—a must if your wedding was the last time the two of you shared a dance. Then wander through the pueblos of Old Town, the original city, that dates back 300 years. Want another excuse to cling to each other? Visit the American International Rattlesnake Museum, where you'll see plenty of live specimens. At night, cruise the kitschy Route 66, ablaze with vintage neon lights, then zip up to the Apothecary Lounge, a rooftop bar that serves up killer cocktails and panoramic views. Admire the amazing Spanish-influenced architecture of San Felipe de Neri, a historic Catholic church. And before you leave town, be sure to take the tramway ($20; sandiapeak.com) to the top of the Sandia Mountains for a breathtaking view of the entire city.\nEAT: Grab tasty tacos and horchata (a sweet, milky drink) on the cheap at Taqueria Mexico, a downtown hole-in-the-wall where locals line up at lunchtime. For a proper date-night atmosphere, have dinner on El Pinto Restaurant's patio surrounded by lush gardens. Try one of their traditional New Mexican dishes that showcase the local chile.\nSTAY: Hotel Andaluz (from $159; hotelandaluz.com ) is a contemporary boutique hotel that contains a popular tapas restaurant and a casbah-style lobby. Or try Bottger Mansion (from $119; bottger.com), an absolutely adorable B&B in the heart of Old Town.\nGIRLFRIENDS\nThere's nothing like catching up with your best friends, away from your families, your jobs, your S.O.'s… phew! Consider this trip a throwback to your slumber-party days, but now you can finally eat whatever you want and stay up past 10 p.m.\nLAMBERTVILLE, NEW JERSEY DO: Just an hour from Newark International Airport is this charming village with a vintage-shopping hot spot: the Golden Nugget Antique Flea Market, where vendors sell World War II posters, 1920s lamps, costume jewelry, and so much more you'll need to pack an empty bag to haul it home in. The best day to shop is Sunday, but you can gear up on Saturday at the town's huge antiques center, The People's Store. There are 45 mini shops on four levels of a lovely landmarked building. When you're shopped out, drive over a short bridge to New Hope, PA, and visit Bowman's Hill Wildflower Preserve ($6; bhwp.org ), home to 800 plant species native to the region, plenty of which you can still see in the fall. On your way out of town, stop at Solebury Orchards to take home freshly picked apples.\nEAT: Refuel with a tasty sub—we suggest the mouthwatering Sicilian porchetta—at Annie's Gourmet. For dinner, get a table at Brian's ($50 for three courses), a casual, cash-only BYOB restaurant that serves elegant French cuisine. Then you can catch up all night at The Boat House, a quiet (no NFL games here), nautical-themed bar.\nSTAY: Hotels in this area are on the pricier side, but the Lambertville House in historic downtown (from $190; lambertvillehouse.com ), whose rooms have Jacuzzi tubs and fireplaces, is worth the pennies. Or stay at the Courtyard Ewing Princeton (from $169; marriott.com) in nearby Ewing, NJ, where there's room to spread out.\nCALISTOGA, CALIFORNIA © Provided by Redbook\nDO: This quiet town in the middle of wine country (about an hour and a half from Oakland International Airport) doubles as a rustic spa retreat, a perfect pairing for a weekend with friends. Book a mud bath at Indian Springs Resort ($95; indianspringscalistoga.com ) and feel your stress levels sink to an all-time low. The price includes a dip in a mineral bath and a session in the eucalyptus-scented steam room. Then walk through the Old West–style downtown and stop in Carmel Gallery to see gorgeous photos of the surrounding wine country, or Ca'Toga Art Gallery for ceramics and sculptures. Wineries along Highway 29 (the main road between Calistoga and Napa) can get packed on the weekend, so head to the less-crowded family-run wineries near town like Lava Vine ($10 for tasting; lavavine.com). On Sunday, take a scenic drive on Silverado Trail, a winding path from Calistoga to Napa through rolling hills and vineyards. Or stretch your legs with a 4.5-mile hike on the Coyote Peak loop trail at Bothe-Napa Valley State Park, where you can view forested valleys and Mount St. Helena.\nEAT: Order the seriously good eggs Benedict with kale and pastrami for brunch at Sam's Social Club. Later, do dinner at Calistoga Inn Restaurant, where you can enjoy house-made gnocchi on the patio by the Napa River.\nSTAY: Carlin Cottages (from $130; carlincottages.com ) are private little houses with plenty of room for a group. The site has a hot springs mineral pool, too. Or opt for the sleek rooms at Dr. Wilkinson's Hot Springs Resort (from $195; drwilkinson.com ) that give you easy access to an on-site spa.\nBOULDER, COLORADO\nDO: Head to this beautiful city if you're a group that can't sit still. (Consider the 45-minute ride from Denver International Airport a chance to rest up.) Start out easy with a morning jog on the paved seven-mile Boulder Creek Path, which runs right through town. If you're feeling adventurous, opt for Enchanted Mesa Trail, a mountainous hike through pine forest and meadows with lovely views of the Boulder Valley. At the trailhead, stop in at Ranger Cottage and ask for ways to add on loops and other trails to make the trek as long (or short) as you like. Another sporty idea: Head 30 minutes outside of town to ride horseback through the mountains (from $35; coloradowildernessridesandguides.com ). Or get in some retail therapy by strolling down the brick walkways on Pearl Street, home to sweet independent boutiques, bookstores, and cafes. Rehydrate after back-to-back activities with a free tour (and samples!) at the Celestial Seasonings tea factory. Cap it off with a low-key girls' night at License No. 1, a historic speakeasy with live music and DJs.\nEAT: For lunch, point yourself to Riffs Urban Fare on Pearl Street, a great farm-to-fork restaurant. Order apps to share (the flash-cooked Brussels sprouts are the specialty), but save room for the amazeballs bittersweet chocolate brownie. At night, try Blackbelly Market, which has a meat-and-cheese shop in the front and a sleek restaurant in the back; they cook up organic veggies, pork, and lamb from the market's own farm.\nSTAY: Book a roadside log cabin at Foot of the Mountain Motel (from $99; footofthemountainmotel.com ). It's just blocks from Pearl Street and hiking trails. Or go higher up and stay at the new A-Lodge on Fourmile Creek with a hot tub, a cozy den, and a bike path that goes straight downtown (from $119; a-lodge.com).\nFAMILIES\nThese turn-off-the-screen-worthy trips are just what your kids didn't even know they needed. Happily, they're all parent-friendly, too.\nFRANKLIN, NORTH CAROLINA\n© highlandscanopytour.com DO: If your kids consider random rocks and flowers to be treasure (even if your washing machine doesn't agree), take them to the \"Gem Capital of the World\" so they can hunt for next year's Mother's Day gift. Fly into Asheville Regional Airport (an hour's drive away), then make your first stop the Gem & Mineral Museum, housed in a 19th-century jailhouse, to see some big wins, like a two-pound ruby found locally. Next, head to one of 10 area mines; our favorite is the Old Cardinal Mine. After filling up a $5 bucket with mined dirt, kids actually have a shot at unearthing rubies, sapphires, and semiprecious stones. One recent visitor discovered a 40-carat sapphire! At other mines, you can hunt for emeralds and garnets and even pan for gold. If you can tear your brood away from the mines (warning: It gets addictive once you find something good), drive east on the 61-mile Mountain Waters Scenic Byway to wade in (and make your kids laugh at the name of) Bust Your Butt Falls, 10 miles from town. And consider driving another three miles to a trailhead for the Appalachian Trail, where you can hike 1.4 miles (each way) to Wesser Bald Lookout Tower. The 360-degree view of the fall foliage is gorgeous, and kids will dig the climb up to the tree-house-like tower. Finish your weekend on a high note at Highlands Aerial Park, where adults and kids as young as 5 can run from tree to tree on suspension bridges and zip lines of varying lengths (from $25; highlandscanopytour.com).\nEAT: While a cash-only restaurant that's open only for lunch doesn't sound super-convenient, Cash's Smoke House's slow-roasted, hickory-smoked ribs, pulled pork, and brisket are completely worth it. For dinner, order burgers and shakes at Motor Company Grill, a fun 1950s-themed diner.\nSTAY: Put your little prospectors to bed in the roomy suites at Cat Creek Lodge, complete with kitchens and screened-in porches ($149; catcreeklodge.com ). The Microtel Inn & Suites (from $69; microtel.com ) is ideal for those looking for super-affordable clean rooms and free breakfast.\nLINCOLN, NEBRASKA DO: This city is a great place for kids to learn and still have amusement-park-level fun—sans the nausea. (Fly right into Lincoln Airport and avoid any car-related queasiness too.) First, spend time at the Lincoln Children's Museum, where fidgety hands can touch and play and even climb into a propeller plane. Then visit the University of Nebraska State Museum, home to an impressive collection of woolly mammoth fossils and a cool planetarium. Animal fans will spot bison year-round at the 668-acre Pioneers Park and Nature Center on the outskirts of town; deer and elk can be found by hiking the park's trails. And a visit to the Museum of American Speed is a must for car lovers with or without a license. You'll fawn over antique Mustangs, Cadillacs, race cars, and more.\nEAT: Take your early risers to The Doughnut Hole, where they sell funky flavors (maple bacon and Snickers bar) and traditional ones as well. In the historic Haymarket District, you can make up for your earlier indulgence by eating healthy, delicious wraps at Maggie's, a tiny vegetarian lunchtime eatery with vegan and gluten-free options. End your day at Yia Yia's pizza, which offers a variety of classic and unique pies—there's one topped with BBQ sauce, cranberries, and pineapple that's a crowd favorite.\nSTAY: The gang can have a hot breakfast and plenty o' space at Comfort Suites East (from $190; choicehotels.com ). Or, set up your family in one of Camp A Way's two cabins (from $89; campaway.com ), which have bathrooms and kitchens; one's open year-round, the other well into the fall.\nGRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN\nDO: This vibrant city with its own international airport (score!) is the perfect manageable size for families with kids—and there's tons to do, indoors and out. First, head over to the 158-acre Frederick Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park. At the children's garden, kids can launch boats in small water pools that are mini-replicas of the Great Lakes, dig for fossils in the rock quarry, and manhandle all the cool-feeling plants they want. You can snag a moment of adult calm in the serene Japanese gardens, with their immaculate rock garden and waterfalls—but the meat-eating vegetation in the carnivorous plant house is something you all need to behold. Then, take the crew to see the nature, tech, and Michigan-specific exhibits at the Grand Rapids Public Museum. Or, to get up close and personal with nature, head for John Ball Zoo, where kids can ride camels, pet farm animals, and touch stingrays and bamboo sharks. For an offbeat adventure, walk over to the Fish Ladder, a series of man-made rapids in the city's Grand River. In autumn, the salmon and carp can be seen flinging themselves up the concrete steps. Just tell the kids that, unfortunately, they can't train their pet goldfish to do the same.\nEAT: Dig in to a hearty meat or a vegan sandwich for lunch at Cherry Deli, one of the best of the city's numerous sandwich spots. To unwind, head over to Electric Cheetah, a restaurant that serves American comfort food made with local and organic ingredients. Try their four different takes on mac and cheese and 40 kinds of craft root beer.\nSTAY: Two kid-friendly (read: They have indoor pools) options are the Holiday Inn Downtown, with clean, comfortable rooms that'll keep you close to the action (from $178; ihg.com ); just a couple of miles from the downtown area is the Riverfront Hotel Grand Rapids (from $129; riverfronthotelgr.com ), where they have rooms with views of Grand River and a fun game room.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.darkcornerdistillery.com/", "http://www.catcreeklodge.com/", "http://www.cdaadventures.com/", "http://www.nationalinstituteofflamenco.org/", "http://www.riverfronthotelgr.com/", "http://www.bhwp.org/", "http://www.pettigruplace.com/", "http://www.therooseveltinn.com/", "http://www.lambertvillehouse.com/", "http://www.drwilkinson.com/", "http://www.indianspringscalistoga.com/", "http://www.carlincottages.com/", "http://www.bmwusfactory.com/", "http://www.reedyrides.com/", "http://www.footofthemountainmotel.com/", "http://www.ihg.com/", "http://www.coloradowildernessridesandguides.com/", "http://www.microtelinn.com/", "http://www.choicehotels.com/", "http://campaway.com/", "http://www.hotelandaluz.com/", "http://www.greenbriarlodging.com/", "http://www.redbookmag.com/", "http://www.highlandscanopytour.com/"], "published": "2015-09-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-24T06:56:19.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
