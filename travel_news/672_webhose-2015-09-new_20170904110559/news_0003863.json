But it doesn’t have to be the end. Huntsham Court is the perfect setting for fans of the TV series to live the life of Lord and Lady Grantham and their family for a weekend. Some people have enquired about holding Downton parties so they can watch the final series in the splendour of Hunstham Court with like-minded family and friends. Up to 80 guests can lodge very comfortably in the 34 bedroom house. All bedrooms are individually styled, some with large four-poster beds and others more quirky such as turret rooms. Most have en-suite facilities. As Downton fans know, it’s the wonderfully snobby Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, who delivers some of the show’s best lines. So what better way to describe Huntsham Court than with some of her phrases? The Huntsham Court team can supply a full staff including chef, footmen and maids. Alternatively, guests seeking total privacy may hire Huntsham Court on a self-catering basis and enjoy cooking in the house’s magnificent double-height vaulted octagonal kitchen, next to the 12-seater Butler’s Pantry for more intimate meals. Huntsham Court can be booked for a day, overnight, mid-week or weekend stay and operates a flexible check-in policy. Guests do not need to hire the entire house. There is the option to hire 19, 27, 31 or all 34 bedrooms. The current owners firmly believe that guests should make Huntsham Court their own country home-from-home during their stay. With Huntsham Court’s five-and-a-half acres of immaculate grounds and five grand reception rooms, there is plenty of space should anyone need a bit of ‘me time’ during the stay. Huntsham Court was built in 1869 and, after being fully restored and refurbished in 2012, is now available as an exclusive-hire country retreat for sophisticated clients looking for relaxed country house grandeur. Guests can hire out Huntsham Court from £80 per person per night based on two-night full occupancy of 34 bedrooms in October, November and December*.*Per person per night price based on 80 sharing. Total price £13,600 for exclusive two-night hire with 34 bedrooms Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-07T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T02:31:02.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
