For many, that housework help involves paying significant money to a human cleaner, but many are increasingly turning to robotic cleaning services as a way of outsourcing household duties. Appliances Direct report that sales of robotic vacuum cleaners are up 259 per cent over the past six months and robotic mopping devices are up 173 per cent in the same period. These types of devices rely on sensor and infrared-based technology to scan rooms to map out spaces and avoid collisions with furniture and objects. Many of these devices can be programmed to clean at convenient times; it’s a multi tasker's dream. Outsource the time-consuming domestic tasks and concentrate on using time to make money elsewhere. Total sense. The economics are logical as well, according to the report. A robotic vacuum cleaner can cost up to £500 to purchase outright, but a human cleaner on average costs £1,500 a year to do the tasks that robotic devices affect to do. However, it is not just products that are accelerating this trend. Start-up companies in the services-on-demand market are proliferating in the app economy , extending way beyond ordering a taxi or engaging an online PA to arrange meetings and scheduling. It’s a huge market and investors are well aware of it. According to the On-Demand Economy industry organisation, $4.8 billion (£3 billion) of capital has already been invested in on-demand companies across sectors that include transportation, payments, ecommerce, health, household services and entertainment. The household services element may not be as cool as so-called sexier industries, but they are becoming mainstream. Companies such as Bizzby promise to have a cleaner at homeowner’s door within 30 minutes, Shuttlecock can deliver meal ingredients to a worker’s officer for £10 and Jinn, ‘an urban delivery platform’ can deliver just about any consumer product from local stores and restaurants. Then there are the real dirty jobs around the house. Fantastic Services is a UK startup that not only offers home cleaning services, but other pesky potential problems such as pest control, decorating, gardening, handyman work and even pet care. Unfortunately, I am not urban enough, living outside the M25 and not being able to access their services. However, for people in London and other UK cities, Fantastic Services does everything it says on its particular (household) tin. For those in European, North American and Australian cities, the service is also available. Co-Founder and chief executive of Fantastic Cleaning, Rune Sovndahl is an interesting gentleman.He has served in the Danish Royal Navy, worked in Michelin-starred restaurants, major telecom providers and a huge travel agency brand… and he doesn’t like a dirty house in more ways than one. “We are growing because people have realised that they can get a bigger return in their personal and professional life if they let us take care of the dull stuff, the ‘chores’. Ultimately we take away people’s problems, which lets them spend more time working towards their personal and professional goals. Simply put, they get more out of life”, says Sovndahl. Some may baulk at robotic maps or robotic vacuum cleaners, but be more than happy to let others do their dirty work while focusing on their more immediate tasks. It’s a model that works for people like me, and it’s one that will work probably work for you too. telegraphsciencetech Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T10:34:09.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
