Along with our 2015 Guide to Oktoberfest , we offer these FAQ to help you enjoy the madness and party without regrets . Why is OKTOBERfest in September? \nThe original Oktoberfest was held in October in 1810. It was to celebrate the wedding of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen (leading to the name of the venue, Theresienwiese ) . All of the fine folk of Munich were invited to eat and - of course - drink for five days. The celebration was such a success, they decided to do it every year and extend the celebration into September. Can you go to Oktoberfest without a reservation? \nWhile reservations are required in the tents after a certain time, getting a seat during off-times (like weekdays before noon) usually isn't a problem. You may be kicked out in the early evening when reservations walk in, but if you've hit it hard it may be time to leave anyways. The grounds are also available to wander at any time and there is some outdoor seating that doesn't require a reservation. Which beer tent is the best? \nThere are 14 main beer tents to choose from and each offers its own allure. The Hofbräu Tent is well-known internationally, meaning it is the most visited by foreigners. Hippodrom is one of the first you see and is known as the celebrity tent. Augustiner is more laid-back and one of the most family-friendly. Schottenhamel is the oldest and largest tent with 10,000-seats. This is where the first keg is tapped ( O’zapft is! ) and the young people party. My favorite tent has been Hacker Pschorr , another large tent, with a mix of locals and foreigners and the charming design and logo of Himmel der Bayern (Heaven for Bavarians). \nThough many people, especially Bavarians, have strong opinions on this point, I find it best to dip into several tents early without a reservation and find your favorite. Is it all foreigners? \nThough we outsiders have done our best, Oktoberfest is still full of Bavarians. About 70 percent of the crowd is local with an estimated 15 percent from elsewhere in Germany where they consider the Bavarian traditions as unique as we do. What kind of beer is there? \nThe beer at Oktoberfest comes from several storied Munich breweries. These include Augustiner, Paulaner and Spaten. Most of these are light-tasting Helles, with a heavy Dunkel Bier (dark German lager) also available. Many of these beers are brewed especially for the event. What should you eat at Oktoberfest? \nExcellent question! In fact, I created a complete line-up of What to eat at Oktoberfest (or anytime you're in Munich) , plus desserts . Think roasted chicken, pretzels and Weisswurst (little white sausages ) for breakfast. How much should you budget per day? \nEntry is free , but little else is. Obviously, how much you need varies wildly but with each Mass costing at least 10 euros , this isn't exactly a discounters paradise. On top of the drinks, expect to pay 12–15 euros for a full meal and 5 euros for a snack. Outside the tents you can find small bites like a Bratwurst in Brot for 4 euros. Expect to bring at least 50 euros a day (cash is king). \nThe biggest cost is accommodations. Prices skyrocket for Oktoberfest and grow steadily higher for last-minute reservations. Expect to pay at least 120 euros per person, per night for a very basic room with hostel beds starting at 40 euros.
