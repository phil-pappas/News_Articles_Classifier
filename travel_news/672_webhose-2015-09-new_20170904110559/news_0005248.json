But a better story sits behind this figure with holiday stay days up 42.2 per cent for the year ended August, which is a great sign that we are attracting more high quality Chinese visitors,” says Kevin.\nGrowth has been further supported by strong holiday arrivals across Tourism New Zealand’s other target Asian markets with Singapore up 11.2 per cent, Malaysia up 10.1 per cent and Korea up 21.4 per cent.\n“Arrival figures for the markets of the US and Germany have again shown significant growth, with holiday arrivals for Germany up 9.1 per cent and the US arrivals up 13.8 per cent on the same period last year.\n“These are both very important markets for us and to see these figures continue to rise in the winter months is fantastic news.”\nTourism New Zealand’s priority emerging markets are continuing to see strong growth with Indonesia (up 13.8 per cent), India (up 24.9 per cent) and Brazil (up 8.4 per cent) all in growth.\nTourism New Zealand’s activity in Latin America is ramping up ahead of the launch of the inaugural Air New Zealand flight to Buenos Aires which will open up exciting new opportunities from Latin America.\nSource:- Tourism New Zealand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-21T08:41:51.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
