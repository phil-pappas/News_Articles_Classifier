As part of the recognition, the airline repainted one of its Airbus A319 aircraft with James’ name.\nIn a surprise ceremony over the weekend, James was joined by his family to see the aircraft for the first time.\nTina Milton, Head of Cabin Services at easyJet, explained: “All of our crew work tirelessly to provide the best possible experience for our passengers, whether it be on the ground, in the air or behind the scenes.\n“James has been working as cabin crew at Bristol for nine years now and is an inspirational role model to the whole team. He consistently goes above and beyond for our passengers. For example one time when there was bad weather in Bristol which caused some delays to flights, James volunteered to come to the terminal to help organise accommodation for our customers. He spent seven hours making sure that each customers’ individual needs were met and they were reassured – then once he got home he called all the hotels to make sure that everyone had been catered for and looked after.\n“James really epitomises easyJet’s values and always puts the customer at the heart of everything he does.”\nJames Baron said: “Being awarded ‘Spirit of easyJet’ is such an honour and the best accolade I could wish for. I am really proud and it’s amazing to have my name on the side of an aircraft that flies hundreds of passengers across Europe every day! The whole Bristol team are absolutely fantastic and we work together to provide our customers in the South West with the best experience we possibly can.”\neasyJet’s Spirit Awards took place at London’s Wembley Stadium earlier this year. Nominations are now open for easyJet’s Spirit awards in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-03T03:03:48.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
