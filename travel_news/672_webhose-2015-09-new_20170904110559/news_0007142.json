Now that the Goals have been approved, it is time to step up our action, time to advance policies and business strategies that monitor and minimize the negative effects of tourism development and maximize its positive impacts, namely through the distribution of its benefits among host communities” said UNWTO Secretary-General, Taleb Rifai.\nThe SDGs are a universal 17-goal plan of action for people, the planet and prosperity for all countries and require all stakeholders to act in collaborative partnerships. The SDGs were approved by the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015.\nTourism is included in the SDGs as a target in Goal 8, Goal 12 and Goal 14:\nGoal 8, on the promotion of “sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all includes as Target 8.9 “By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products”.\nGoal 12 aimed to “ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” includes as Target 12.b to “Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism which creates jobs, promotes local culture and products”.\nGoal 14 set to “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development” includes as target 14.7 “by 2030 increase the economic benefits of SIDS and LCDs from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism”.\nSource:- UNWTO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:14:22.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
