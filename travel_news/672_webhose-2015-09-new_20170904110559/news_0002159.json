Located in the Tsavo West National Park, Finch Hattons Luxury Camp is set around natural fresh water springs within 10 million acres of pure untouched wilderness; surrounded by views of Mount Kilimanjaro and the magnificent Chyulu Hills. Designed to be minimally intrusive, the camp offers guests stunning views from the 17 luxury suites which fuse modern design with rustic charm to provide an experience that combines safari adventure with contemporary comforts.\nAside from breath-taking wildlife, highlights at this destination include having sundowners with the backdrop of the magnificent Mount Kilimanjaro; exploring the unique geology of the area; spotting prolific birdlife and even doing yoga on the exercise deck overlooking the Chyulu Hills.\nFlying onwards, days three and four are when guests will arrive at Mahali Mzuri , which means 'beautiful place' in Swahili and perfectly describes Sir Richard Branson's tented Safari camp. Located in the private and exclusive Olare Motorogi Conservancy on the northern edge of Kenya's famous Maasai Mara National Park, guests can explore 13,500 hectares of wildlife rich plains, led by our experienced Maasai guides. At Mahali Mzuri guests will not only have a front row seat to the migration, but also to the abundant game seen all year round.\nOur twelve tents are perched on a ridge taking advantage of the amazing views over the valley below, each with a distinctive design adapted to the local climate and terrain. Guests at Mahali Mzuri can expect exciting game drives with experienced guides, delicious meals, a cosy and relaxing atmosphere all in a uniquely designed, spacious and luxurious tent.\nLinked once again by private air charter in an executive Cessna, the journey continues to the last of the three experiences called Segera . Segera lies at the very heart of the Laikipia Plateau, which is nestled between the glorious Mount Kenya to the east and the Great Rift Valley to the west. A stunningly diverse environment, the Laikipia region boasts woodlands, grasslands and fertile riverbeds where water flowing from the Aberdare Mountains long ago gave rise to the Mutara River to the north, and the Ewaso Nyiro, Suguroi and Segera Rivers to the south. This abundant water attracts herds of elephant, buffalo, giraffe, warthog and many other native species throughout the year.\nIt is at this destination that guests can enjoy a philanthropic experience as one of the game drives leads to the SATUBO women's beading group - A Zeitz's Foundation Initiative that has transformed the age-old tradition of beading and handicraft into a financial viable enterprise. Guests may participate by learning how to make the beaded products with the option of purchasing some of the handmade traditional jewellery. This premium lodge with a private home feel is a fantastic finish to this ultimate journey.\nDay seven is left simply for reminiscing over the magical moments experienced on Kenyan soil under African skies as the private plane heads out of paradise.\nRates for Flying Safari start from $12,000 USD per person for a s ix night stay based on double occupancy.\nWhat ' s included?\nFull board accommodation as per the itinerary All standard drinks (excluding premium drinks such as Champagne, Cogn acs, single malt whiskey etc at Finch Hattons and Segera ) All transfers to and from the hotels/lodges/camps All domestic private charter flights in an Exclusive Grand Caravan 8 Seater All game drives in 4X4 Safari Vehicles with the assistance of English-speaking driver guides The park entry f ees (subject to change)\nVirgin Limited Edition is an award-winning collection of unique retreats, chosen for their beautiful locations and magnificent surroundings; each offers a sense of fun, style, luxury and exceptional personal service.
