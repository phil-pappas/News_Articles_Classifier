The murder rate had dramatically decreased, a sophisticated anti-terrorism unit thwarted numerous serious attacks and, he felt, his police tactics had made the streets safer. His methods had certainly been divisive, and set him on a collision course with liberals. But with statistics showing only 335 murders in 2013 , compared to 2,250 when he was first appointed commissioner in 1994, he was at peace with his legacy, and left policing to go into business. Now, however, Mr Kelly is back. The two-term commissioner, who served from 1992 to 1994, and again from 2002-13, last week published a book which delivered a scathing verdict on current policing of the city. Bill de Blasio, the serving mayor, and his police chief Bill Bratton have boasted about this summer being the safest on record, with a fall in violent crime. Yet the murder rate, year on year, has increased by eight per cent, with 208 murders to mid August , latest figures show. Mr Kelly pointed the finger directly at Mr de Blasio for allowing the death toll to creep upwards again. “These police officers have been given signals directly and indirectly to stand down and not be as proactive as in the past,” said Mr Kelly. “If they choose to disengage, there’s no penalty. That’s the primary reason for the increase in murder. Police are reacting to what has been happening in Ferguson: They are less willing to engage, and that translates into more violence and more death.” The 74-year-old New Yorker and Vietnam veteran became a policeman 49 years ago, when he graduated at the top of his class at the Police Academy. After a training session at a firing range, he said, he was handed a gun and put right out on the street. “We wouldn’t dare do anything like that these days,” he said.

After the 9/11 attacks, under the command of Michael Bloomberg, the then-mayor, he set up his own counterterrorism unit, the first of its kind – sometimes described as a mini CIA. Muslim leaders were furious that he sent informants into mosques, and he was heckled off the stage during speech about police tactics at Brown University, shortly before he stood down. Yet it was the “stop and frisk” policy for which he is remembered. At its peak, in 2011, 685,000 New Yorkers were searched – 91 per cent of them ethnic minorities. Critics say it was an abuse of power, but Mr Kelly is unapologetic. He writes that on the basis of descriptions of suspects provided by victims of violent crimes, “we were proportionally understopping African-Americans, not overstopping them.” And yet when he left, the policy ground to a halt. Mr Bratton, his successor, now uses the term “broken windows policing” to describe how he prefers to go after criminals for small crimes, to lift the sense of pride in a neighbourhood and drive down serious crime. And in 2014, the number of Stop and Frisks had fallen to 50,000. “Murders are up,” stated Mr Kelly, in a blunt interview in conjunction with the release of his memoir. “And if you have a propensity to carry a gun and there’s a policy to de-emphasise stop and question and frisk, it’s only common sense you’ll see more people carrying guns and more crime.” In the book, entitled Vigilance: My Life Serving America and Protecting Its Empire City, Mr Kelly directs particular ire at Judge Shira Scheindlin, who ruled in August 2013 – while Mr Kelly was still commissioner – that police stops violated the constitutional rights of minorities. The mayor, Mr de Blasio, declined to appeal against her ruling – to the fury of the outgoing chief. “De Blasio shrugged and walked away from a routine and useful policing tool, snatching law enforcement defeat from the jaws of legal victory,” he writes. Little time is given to Mr Bratton, the current chief, who is described as an effective enforcer of the mayor's policies. But Mr Bratton has sprung to the defence of a decision taken by the mayor to reduce Stop and Frisk. “The number one issue we heard over and over again was that the black community — rich, poor, middle class — was concerned about this issue,” said Mr Bratton, in a New Yorker article published last week. “The commissioner, whom they liked quite a bit, and Mayor Bloomberg, who polled well for a long time, just weren’t listening. They were kind of tone-deaf to this issue. So we worked really hard, myself and Mayor de Blasio, to respond.” Mr de Blasio, for his part, has simply stated that Mr Kelly should look at the statistics. But Mr Kelly, undaunted, has kept up the attacks. “Perception is reality in many ways, particularly in this city,” he said. “There’s a feeling that this city is drifting.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-12T04:35:39.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
