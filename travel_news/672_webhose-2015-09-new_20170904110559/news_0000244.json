This, in turn, is highlighting the need for storage capacity. As a result, data storage technology (DST) providers are ramping up technology in this mature market to enable ultra-high-density data storage.\nNew analysis from Frost & Sullivan, Impact of Data Storage Technologies in Key Sectors ( https://www.frost.com/d683 ), finds that magnetic and optical data storage systems are the most common, commercially available DSTs. While non-volatile memory systems are staking claim to a larger number of applications, owing to their value-added functionalities, volatile memory solutions continue to hold their own.\nFor complimentary access to more information on this research, please visit: http://bit.ly/1iFGN41\n\"Low power consuming devices have been the hallmark of next-generation DSTs,\" said Technical Insights Research Analyst Jabez Mendelson . \"High-speed read-write cycle capabilities, in particular, have made low-voltage operations possible and allowed emerging DSTs to make headway in a number of applications across sectors.\"\nFor instance, DSTs are expected to transform the consumer electronics sector in the next five to six years, especially as the smartphone industry looks for low-cost, high-performance, high-density data storage. DSTs can also strengthen the wearables market in the near term.\nAs a result, the data collected through DSTs could bolster management systems, as historic data facilitates the learning of patterns and serves as input for further research. A case in point would be the adoption of power management systems in the energy distribution sector to reduce energy wastage.\nAdditionally, the implementation of DST in driver assistant systems can accelerate the commercialization prospects of unmanned vehicles. The technology can also create new treatment opportunities in the healthcare sector based on information collected and enable medical devices that assist in human-machine interaction.\n\"However, some sectors have distinct methods of device classification and their requirements may not be transparent, making it harder for DST manufacturers to develop adept solutions in the midst of intensifying competition,\" noted Mendelson . \"Vendors must strategically position technologies in key sectors early in their life cycle in order to generate the most revenue prior to patent expiration and extend their reach to newer applications across industries.\"\nImpact of Data Storage Technologies in Key Sectors , a part of the Technical Insights ( http://ww2.frost.com/research/technology/information-communication ) subscription, offers insights on the impact of data storage technologies across key sectors such as consumer electronics, industrial, energy distribution, healthcare, and automotive and transportation. The coverage includes drivers and challenges, global trends and innovation indicators, breadth of applications impacted, technology and application roadmaps showing the future prospect of DSTs, and strategic insights about market and emerging trends evaluated following extensive interviews with market participants.\nTechnical Insights is an international technology analysis business that produces a variety of technical news alerts, newsletters, and research services.\nAbout Frost & Sullivan\nFrost & Sullivan, the Growth Partnership Company, works in collaboration with clients to leverage visionary innovation that addresses the global challenges and related growth opportunities that will make or break today's market participants.\nOur \"Growth Partnership\" supports clients by addressing these opportunities and incorporating two key elements driving visionary innovation: The Integrated Value Proposition and The Partnership Infrastructure.\nThe Integrated Value Proposition provides support to our clients throughout all phases of their journey to visionary innovation including: research, analysis, strategy, vision, innovation and implementation.
