The concern was that the scheduled time of departure would not leave sufficient time for fans to reach the airport and clear security in time to make the flight home Flybe leapt into action to see what it could do and, as a result, has been able to make the necessary operational changes to allow the BE872 Manchester to Southampton flight, originally scheduled to depart at 19:05 on 17th October, to now leave at 19:50, enabling fans to more comfortably reach the departure gate to make the short one-hour flight home.\nPaul Simmons, Flybe’s Chief Commercial Officer, comments: “We are always pleased to hear from our customers and will always do our best to serve their needs. Logistically, it is a complex issue to alter the timing of a flight, albeit for a few minutes, and it is not often possible. However, in this instance, we are delighted that we have been able to do so. We would like to thank the customer who alerted us to this particular issue facing the returning Bournemouth fans, who will now have sufficient time to make their flight back home with us after this important match.”\nSource:- Flybe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T18:56:35.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
