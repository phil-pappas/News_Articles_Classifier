This is the second year in a row that FTZ #138 was ranked in the top 10.\n \nAdministered by the Columbus Regional Airport Authority and serving 25 counties in Central Ohio, FTZ #138 allows companies to increase global competitiveness and profits by lowering costs associated with importing merchandise, including textiles, footwear, pharmaceuticals and electronics. Benefits of the FTZ include: deferred, reduced or eliminated U.S. Customs import duties; reduced processing fees; quicker movement of goods from the Port of Entry; supply chain predictability; strong inventory control; and best practice relative to cargo security.\n \n“We are thrilled to be named among the top 10 FTZs for the second year in a row,” said David Whitaker, Vice President of Business Development & Communications at CRAA. “We are dedicated to helping companies in the Columbus Region become more competitive in the global marketplace by taking advantage of the economic benefits and time savings offered by Foreign-Trade Zone #138.”\n \nIn addition to providing direct benefits for companies shipping goods in and out of the country, FTZs also have a large impact on the overall economy. The 179 active U.S. FTZs employed approximately 420,000 workers in 2014 and imported merchandise with a total value of $798 billion.\n \nFTZ #138 received its number 10 ranking via the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zone Board’s 2014 Annual Report to Congress just released this month. The Board is part of the International Trade Administration within the U.S. Department of Commerce.\n \nSource:- Columbus Airport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-26T18:37:58.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
