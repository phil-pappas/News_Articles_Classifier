Credit: flickr.com/ Mara 1 \nAn animal advocacy group has called for the end to elephant rides and tricks for tourists, saying that behind the scenes is a tragic situation. \n\"Most tourists go on elephant rides because they love elephants. They don't know about the intense physical and psychological pain involved,\" World Animal Protection said in a report titled Breaking Africa's Elephants. \n\"They will not be told that baby elephants are cruelly taken from their mothers, and their spirits harshly broken for training to give rides and perform tricks for tourists.\" \nThe report focuses on the situation in Southern Africa, where elephant rides are plentiful. \nThe organisation says that despite the claims of the elephant rides industry, all elephants used for entertainment go through an intensive process to break their spirits. \nThis process includes restraining the elephants with chains or ropes and using bullhooks, whips and other objects in inflict pain on the elephant. The process often also involves food or water deprivation. \n\"Elephant handlers in Southern Africa have confirmed to us that all young elephants undergo the same breaking process as used in Asia,\" World Animal Protection said. \n\"This is despite the widespread claims of African elephant ride businesses that their elephants are 'trained' through a system of rewards such as molasses pellets.\" \nThe organisation believes that if more tourists knew about the breaking process, they would not buy into the tourist gimmicks. \nIt urged tourists to only visit ethical wildlife destinations and legitimate sanctuaries. \n\"Ethical wildlife tourists can help end the unnecessary suffering of elephants by refusing to visit the parks that offer rides, shows and tricks,\" the organisation said. \n\"Genuine elephant sanctuaries, such as the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, have animal welfare at the core of what they do. They will not use elephants in performances for tourists or allow the elephants to be ridden.\" \nYou can read the full report here . \nWhat do you think of elephant riding?
