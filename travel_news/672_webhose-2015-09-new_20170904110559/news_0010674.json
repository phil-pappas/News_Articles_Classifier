Matilda , about a book-loving girl with special powers who finds ways to cope with less-than-ideal situations, is a fine example. \nThe 2012 musical version, with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and book by Dennis Kelly, is splendid, and awards-givers thought so too. It dominated the Olivier Awards (Britain’s Tony) in 2012, and while it lost the big prize in 2013 to the inferior Kinky Boots , it has been well regarded on Broadway. And its national tour has been anticipated, especially by Dahl-loving parents, bringing their children out for perhaps their first time at a major touring musical. \nBut the production currently bookmarked at the Winspear Opera House, opening AT&T Performing Arts Center’s 2015-16 Broadway Season, will be met with mixed feelings. It’s so fun to look at and watch, and the songs are clever and catchy and sometimes, fiercely beautiful. The problem: It’s very hard to understand most of them. \nSigns throughout the Winspear warn patrons that the lyrics are intricate and they’re performed in authentic British accents, of various regions, but the problem goes beyond that. If you listen to either the original Broadway and London cast recordings, you can hear every word of those lyrics, thick accents and all. \nWould that the performers on this tour — notably the children — put that same stock in the live performance. \nDirected by well-regarded comedy interpreter Matthew Warchus, with music direction by Matthew Smedal and voice direction by Andrew Wade, this leg of the tour is rough-going, sound wise. The diction problems, mixed with the speed and intricacy of the lyrics plus sound-balance issues at the Winspear (on the night reviewed, the orchestra could have been a touch louder), makes for a muddy theater-going experience. Texans aren’t the only audiences who’ve complained about this issue. \nThat’s too bad, because it was clear that Mia Sinclair Jenness in the title role (she alternates with Gabby Gutierrez and Mabel Tyler) is everything you want this character to be: precocious, spunky and a little odd, not willing to be held back by adults around her who seem willing to do just that. \nNotably, what would be school marm Miss Trunchbull, played by Bryce Ryness with a comically scary sense of discipline. There’s something underneath yearning to get out of that stern exterior, but we know it will probably never happen. Matilda is also hampered by her guardians, Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood (Quinn Mattfeld and Cassie Silva), who favor telly-watching over reading and learning. Miss Honey (Jennifer Blood)<CQ> is the only adult in Matilda’s life who gets it. \nThe adults, for the most part, can be understood. And even problems with the lyrics can be overlooked in a song as wonderful as When I Grow Up , which includes the kids and older versions of them swinging over the stage on swings that hang from the rafters. \nPeter Darling’s choreography is inventive, and Rob Howell’s set, dominated by alphabet blocks and images of books and libraries, make you want to crawl into this imaginative world. Of course, you can always do that at your local library. \nAnd if anyone talks too loudly there, whether you can hear them or not, you can always shush them. \nMatilda the Musical \nAT&T Performing Arts Center \nWinspear Opera House", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-29T04:05:29.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
