Credit John Burcham for The New York Times Within the Grand Canyon, the Lure of Havasu Falls An idyllic place yields plenty of surprises, including a warm welcome by American Indian villagers and a restorative dip in a stunning natural pool. By RAQUEL CEPEDA Continue reading the main story One has only to lay eyes on a picture of the incandescent pools of Havasu Falls, somewhere between beryl and cerulean, to feel its pull. The vibrant basins of the rippling natural pool are a study in contrast with the stunning force of the waterfall that crashes into them, spilling 90 feet over red rocks. It is, simply, beatific. And the falls, at the bottom of a narrow gorge near the southwest corner of the Grand Canyon National Park , are about a two-mile hike north of Supai Village in one of the most remote indigenous-American enclaves in the country. The place had summoned me from the moment I learned of its existence about a year earlier. I thought that when I went I’d be instantly transported by wandering among a relatively sparse population, if but for a few long moments, living on one of those Technicolor landscapes nature bestows on you, if you’re lucky, once in a lifetime. I planned carefully. I would take a trip, family in tow, and descend the canyon’s depths. So we flew to Phoenix from our home in New York City, drove and stayed in Sedona and then made our way to Seligman, the birthplace of the historic Route 66, then to the end of Indian Route 18, and ultimately the Grand Canyon’s Hualapai Hilltop. Once there, we would wait, and wait, for a helicopter down to Supai. Credit John Burcham for The New York Times The exhilarating, albeit short, ride was piloted by a man whose manner was like a stoked cowboy’s. My 3-year-old son, Marceau, who had never been in a helicopter, sat quietly, scanning everything he saw out the window with eyes wide open. When we arrived, we were, indeed, transported, but it wasn’t to a different world. I stood on the landing pad of the helicopter in which we’d descended, holding my toddler’s hand in the searing midday heat. Then, as the sound of the chopper receded, it was replaced by the deliberate drumbeat of hip-hop music pouring out of loudspeakers: the lingua franca of youth cultures the world over. As we approached a nearby cafe, we found its source. A group of striking teenagers, descendants of some of North America’s most ancient people, dressed in basketball shorts, oversize T-shirts and slide sandals with socks. They were Havasupai or Supai, as locals who live on the reservation refer to one another. Seeing and hearing something so familiar made the long journey we’d taken to get there, if for a beat, surreal. After months of planning and hours of road-tripping, my husband, Sacha, my 18-year-old daughter, Djali, Marceau and I felt at home, despite being in a remote area of the park visited by only 20,000 people annually (compared with the five million who tour other parts). We were thousands of miles from home, yet that drumbeat may as well have been the unfurling of a grand welcome mat. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The Havasupai people — they call themselves Havsuw ‘Baaj, or “the Blue Creek people,” although they are known by the Hualapai derivative of their name, Havasu, or “blue-green water,” and pai, “people” — while hospitable were also insular by nature. But the teenagers blaring hip-hop, other locals and tourists hiking to and from the campgrounds were chilling on the deck of the only place to eat on the reservation, a food desert whose menu consisted of the same fried and greasy fare, with the exception of Indian tacos, found in many rural and low-income communities. As I approached the cafe with Djali and Marceau, we noticed that several locals eating at a nearby table stared at us. We weren’t sure if we stood out because our skin tones ranged from pecan to mocha, or if, unlike the majority of visitors to the parks, our big, curly locks commanded attention. Our guide, Jason Danoff, who runs Trail Lovers Excursions, had warned us that it was highly unlikely that they would speak. But when we sat down at a round table with a clear view of the landing strip, a middle-aged local man holding a cane approached us and settled the matter. “Your daughter,” he said, sitting down next to Djali, “her wild and curly hair reminds me of Diana Ross. Fierce!” He recounted seeing Ms. Ross in a concert in Central Park long ago and wanted to know everything about us: Was I married? Had I ever been to Las Vegas? Why did I have a dream catcher tattoo on my left arm? “Yes, no, and because it’s my spiritual armor,” I said. Photo Lower Navajo Falls, also called Little Navajo Falls. Credit John Burcham for The New York Times I had long believed that the call for reparations to descendants of African slaves should be expanded to include Native Americans, and the situation of the Havasupai was a stark reminder of why. They were forced to relocate to this narrow gorge after roaming freely for centuries across some three million acres of the Grand Canyon’s South Rim, according to the tome “I Am the Grand Canyon: The Story of the Havasupai People,” regarded as a bible to many tribal elders. The 2010 census recorded the poverty rate on the Havasupai Indian Reservation at 37 percent, twice that of the state’s. Two-thirds of Havasupai children under 18 live in poverty. They are the antithesis of the casino-rich tribes who have become a pop culture trope. As we stood looking at the people before us, their inherent will was apparent. They have kept key aspects of their culture intact, like the Havasupai language, which is part of the Hokan family of languages. (They are the only Native American community in the country where every tribal member, about 500, speaks the language.) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story By the time Sacha and Mr. Danoff, our guide, joined us almost a half-hour later, Marceau was running around the deck yelling “Hi!” to the diners, while Djali and I picked at our tater tots and an Indian taco. It was time to go, and we grabbed our gear. We wouldn’t be seeing the locals again. We said farewell, thankful for their hospitality. Our lot, close to Mooney Falls, was separated from two other small parties of what looked (and sounded) like college frat boys by a stream flowing into the Colorado River. We arrived late afternoon and sat on a wooden picnic table at our home base snacking on trail mix and cranberry oatmeal cookies while Mr. Danoff pitched a green tent that slept four comfortably. He also hung a light inside to keep Marceau from freaking out in pitch darkness. (He did whimper, but minutes in, fell soundly asleep.) Djali, deciding she’d confront her fear of the dark, slept in a burnt-orange hammock affixed to two trees, with the sound of rushing water underneath her.

Credit John Burcham for The New York Times The next morning, we rose early and, fortified by the oatmeal Mr. Danoff made for breakfast, walked about half a mile to Havasu Falls. The cactus-lined walk to the falls over tiny pebbles and terra-cotta dirt didn’t feel like a walk at all; it was more like a free-floating glide, one of those iconic camera dolly shots from a Spike Lee Joint. Once at the falls, two things happened that were beyond our comprehension. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T08:07:43.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
