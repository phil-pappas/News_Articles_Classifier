Recently, PTAA supported UFTAA’s stance against Lufthansa Group charging 16 euro (US$18) for every ticket issued using the global distribution system. \n\nVictoria told TTG Asia e-daily : “There is also a need for national associations (like PTAA) to have representations in regional as well as international federations of travel industry stakeholders.” \n\nShe added that she would be attending a UFTAA meeting – that will tackle how the federation is being revitalised – in November. \n\nIt’s understood that PTAA put its status as inactive about three years ago when UFTAA was assessing its direction due to funding problems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-18T19:45:33.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
