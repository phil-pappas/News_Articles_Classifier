The Regency building, which sleeps eight, is already fully booked until the end of 2016.\nJohn Fowles lived in the villa for almost four decades, from 1968, and much of his work was competed there, including his best-known novel The French Lieutenant’s Woman (also a film), which is partly set in Lyme Regis.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Interior of the renovated Belmont\nFowles hoped Belmont could be enjoyed by many people in the future, particularly other writers. As well as being available for holiday rentals, the house will host annual study weeks for creative writing students.\nRelated: Food in fashion: Dorset's restaurant and hotel scene\nBelmont was also owned by pioneering 18th-century businesswoman Eleanor Coade , who established a successful artificial stone business that led to Coade-stone being used in many Regency buildings across the UK, including the Royal Naval College, in Greenwich, and Buckingham Palace.\nExamples of Coade-stone embellishments have been preserved at Belmont, including the intricate face of Neptune on the keystone and the urns, freize and quoins. With no surviving portraits of Coade, Belmont is considered by the trust to be the only substantial monument to her life.\nDr Anna Keay, director of the Landmark Trust, described the “enormous pride” of having completed the restoration during the charity’s 50th anniversary year.\n“The rejuvenated building is once again a fitting monument to the genius of Eleanor Coade,” she said. “Visitors will now be able to stay in her Georgian architectural gem and in so doing experience the beauty and peace that inspired one of our greatest modern writers, John Fowles.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest View of the Lyme Regis coast from Belmont\nThe Landmark Trust bought Belmont in 2007. At the time, the building was in urgent need of repair. The charity led the restoration process in-house, using traditional craft skills to restore and renovate the house.\nThe bright pink facade matches the original shade from Coade’s time, while the fireplace and decoration in the sitting room – where Fowles would write – are all original.\nA permanent exhibition in the former stables will begin on 9 October, and will be open from 2pm-5pm every Friday from 1 April-31 October. The exhibition will offer a window into the lives of Coade and Fowles as well as Victorian GP and amateur astronomer Dr Richard Bangay, another former resident of the house.\nBelmont was built in 1774 and is considered an excellent example of the type of seaside villa that emerged during a time when sea bathing and rural holiday homes were growing in popularity.\nThe villa has two double and two single bedrooms, and can be rented at a cost of £640 for four nights. It joins a register of 195 other historic buildings owned by the Landmark Trust, which are available to let for short breaks.", "external_links": ["http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Landmark+Trust+opens+John+Fowles%27+former+home+for+holiday+rentals&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F25%2Flandmark-trust-opens-john-fowles-home-holiday-rentals&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F25%2F1443196407469%2F2ecac29f-68b4-4624-9d04-bbb158b7a1a9-1020x612.jpeg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFZPSQKjwwc", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443196339444/806b8d8b-9749-4fde-93d5-45104b79d8e3-1020x612.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=b329ebf7a47f35f9ade40b6ad058c175", "http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443196339444/806b8d8b-9749-4fde-93d5-45104b79d8e3-1020x612.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=b7cd3269b8cafb35cff550c02611b4a8", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443196407469/2ecac29f-68b4-4624-9d04-bbb158b7a1a9-1020x612.jpeg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=e7a98a4d9a45f133cbe61a571ac6b40d", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cym9%2Fsfb%23img-3&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cym9&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F25%2F1443196407469%2F2ecac29f-68b4-4624-9d04-bbb158b7a1a9-1020x612.jpeg", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cym9%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cym9&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F25%2F1443196339444%2F806b8d8b-9749-4fde-93d5-45104b79d8e3-1020x612.jpeg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Landmark+Trust+opens+John+Fowles%27+former+home+for+holiday+rentals&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cym9%2Fstw%23img-3", "http://www.landmarktrust.org.uk/Properties-list/belmont/holiday/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Coade", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Landmark+Trust+opens+John+Fowles%27+former+home+for+holiday+rentals&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4cym9%2Fstw%23img-2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443196407469/2ecac29f-68b4-4624-9d04-bbb158b7a1a9-1020x612.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=aff8f4ca316e54b00d21b5e6c62dc293", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443196339444/806b8d8b-9749-4fde-93d5-45104b79d8e3-1020x612.jpeg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f992c23ec053002bd17695c3e6beda3e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443196339444/806b8d8b-9749-4fde-93d5-45104b79d8e3-1020x612.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=451286f8ac2470c87961a1db2f65478a", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Landmark+Trust+opens+John+Fowles%27+former+home+for+holiday+rentals&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftravel%2F2015%2Fsep%2F25%2Flandmark-trust-opens-john-fowles-home-holiday-rentals&media=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.guim.co.uk%2Fsys-images%2FGuardian%2FPix%2Fpictures%2F2015%2F9%2F25%2F1443196339444%2F806b8d8b-9749-4fde-93d5-45104b79d8e3-1020x612.jpeg", "http://www.fowlesbooks.com/", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443196407469/2ecac29f-68b4-4624-9d04-bbb158b7a1a9-1020x612.jpeg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=f15242919b4b638d0bbc6557dbc1d24f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/9/25/1443196407469/2ecac29f-68b4-4624-9d04-bbb158b7a1a9-1020x612.jpeg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=7519eab857e82a95c9e895c26e6a5da0"], "published": "2015-09-26T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T19:02:31.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
