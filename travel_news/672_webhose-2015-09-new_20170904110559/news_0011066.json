While the hotel will offer \"convenience\" and \"access\" to the airport that others in the BWI Corridor won't, a feasibility study concluded that the demand for the on site hotel would not negatively impact other hotels in the region, Smith said. \nThe airport's project to connect the D and E Concourse is on schedule to be completed in 2017, Smith said. \nThe airport has not been immune to controversy. In August, an Anne Arundel Circuit Court administrative law judge found racial discrimination played a part in the March 2014 firing of the airport's former Fire Chief Gregory Lawrence. \nA county circuit court judge ordered Lawrence be reinstated last November, prompting the MAA to appeal the decision. He's since been re-assigned as a deputy chief at the department, Smith said. \nThe MAA is reviewing the August ruling and had not made any decision of whether to pursue any further appeals as of Friday, Smith said. \nLawrence, like Smith, is an African American. \nDuring Smith's tenure in Ohio, he oversaw the development of a $25 million food, beverage and retail program at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, as well as the implementation of a new airport taxicab program and the airport's \"Going places,\" public relations campaign, according to a bio provided by the MAA. \nAfter Smith's MAA's job was announced in July, Cleveland mayor Frank G. Jackson issued a statement commending him for his service to the city. \n\"I know he will provide the same level of leadership and service in his new position,\" Jackson said. \nSmith was Cleveland's highest paid city official with a salary of $234,000, according to the Northwest Ohio Media Group. His new salary represents a 25 percent pay increase. \nFrom a personal standpoint, Smith said that he \"couldn't be happier\" to return to Maryland. Smith and his wife Karen, have four children ranging in age from 11-to-33, he said. \nHis eldest son and daughter stayed in Maryland when he moved the rest of the family to Cleveland, he said. His mother also still lives in the area, he said. \nWhile Smith said he enjoys all the restaurants and shops at the airport there is one that's particularly special to him â€“ Obrycki's, a crab house and seafood restaurant. \nDuring his time in Ohio, Smith was able to convince Obrycki's to open a location at the Cleveland airport, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T00:33:56.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
