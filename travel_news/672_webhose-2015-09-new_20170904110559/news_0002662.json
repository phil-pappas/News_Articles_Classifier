The innovative airport shuttle provider operating in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany is the first shuttle service among Hahn Air System’s over 40 air and ground transportation partners. \nHahn Air Systems is a sister company of airline distribution and ticketing specialist Hahn Air. As of September 14, 2015 Tinker will offer a car shuttle connection between Brussels Airport and Amsterdam Airport in all major GDSs via the speed-alliance® code 5W. From October, roundtrip connections to Antwerp, The Hague, Rotterdam and Dusseldorf will be serviced from Amsterdam as well. Through the partnership, 95,000 travel agencies in 190 markets will be able to issue tickets for Tinker’s services via the standard GDS ticketing process on the Hahn Air HR-169 document. \n“This is a big opportunity for us and the industry”, says Tinker founder Rob van Strien. “We are connecting airports with car transfers at discounted prices. By being the only shuttle service available on the GDS air displays, we are enabling airlines and travel agents to easily combine flight routes with Tinker services and to expand their network by connecting more regional airports. By partnering with Hahn Air Systems we are introducing an innovative intermodal distribution model offering a unique opportunity for airlines to seamlessly interline with our car shuttles. We are planning to extend our network to the rest of Europe later this year.” \n“We are thrilled to welcome Tinker to our partner network”, says Simon Riha, Head of Business Development at Hahn Air. “Tinker makes airport transfers affordable to a wider audience and offers passengers a comfortable way to travel between regional airports. With our first shuttle service partner, we are opening our Hahn Air Systems network for different types of ground transportation companies, alongside our existing railway and airline partners.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T23:16:16.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
