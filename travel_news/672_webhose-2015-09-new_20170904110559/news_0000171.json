Photo by DAMIAN SHAW.com \nIt was the first chance for the Australian-born restaurateur and chef to experience a locally-based Princess ship since partnering with the cruise line. \nThe exclusive partnership will see culinary offerings designed by Curtis served across Princess’ 18-ship fleet, including “Crafted by Curtis” menu items which will be available in the main dining room across all ships and Curtis’ first restaurant at sea – SHARE – to be introduced on select Princess’ ships. \nAustralians will be among the first holidaymakers in the world to experience the new Crafted by Curtis items when they debut next month on Golden Princess, which will be arriving in Sydney on October 18 for her maiden season of cruising down under. Golden Princess will be based in Melbourne from the end of October through to April 2016. Meanwhile SHARE will be launched in Australian waters next April onboard the local Princess ship Sun Princess. \nYesterday’s arrival of Diamond Princess marks the start of Australia’s biggest summer cruise season yet. Sailing in from Asia, the 116,000-tonne, 290-metre long Diamond Princess will be based in Sydney for the next six months offering a series of roundtrip cruises to New Zealand, the South Pacific and around Australia. She departed last night on a 13-night cruise around New Zealand.
