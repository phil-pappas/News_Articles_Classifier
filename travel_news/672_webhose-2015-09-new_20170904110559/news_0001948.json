But before long it could be the other way round, and children will be taking the old folk to their own specially designed elder playground. Then it will be their turn to sit twiddling their thumbs while their grandparents amuse themselves on machines specially designed to exercise older limbs and muscles. Outdoor senior playgrounds are now springing up all over the world with the aim of encouraging older people to exercise in a fun, safe and effective way. The very first European city to open such a park was Berlin, closely followed by Blackley, Manchester, in 2008. A similar playground was opened in Eastbourne in May 2009, along the lines of the Manchester park. There has been a senior playground in Hyde Park since 2010 , and now, Spain has at least 600 of them. There are 300 in Greater Barcelona alone, and more are being planned, to cater for the ever-increasing pensioner population in the country, both natives and expats. The playgrounds are now becoming popular in America as well. The equipment in most of the playgrounds is designed by the Finnish company Lappsett, who have now sold thousands of their machines aimed at older exercisers, all over the world. The machines are of four main types, to exercise the upper body, leg muscles, stomach and legs in turn, and they are supposed to be safe for people of all fitness levels, including even the supremely unfit, who can surprise themselves on a muted version of the cross trainer. The playgrounds have space walkers, body twisters, skiers and treadmills, in chunky designs and bright colours, perhaps looking more like giant versions of children’s equipment than the hardcore stuff seen in the gym. But that is part of the point. The machines are designed to be non-scary and used with ordinary clothes and shoes rather than hi-tech body-skimming gym outfits. You can be sure that you won’t be working out next to an elite athlete training for an ultra marathon. Most over-60s have not grown up with modern-style gyms, and they can feel excluded by the atmosphere of serious training and super-fit bodies ; so much so that mostly, they shudder and stay away from them. The senior machines are different, as everybody using them will be over 60 themselves. They can be safely used by patients recovering from major heart surgery and in fact are recommended for such people. The idea is that the playgrounds are fun to use as well as being a good way of burning calories and getting fresh air. As they are also non-competitive, they make a change from bowls, for instance, and an added advantage is that they can be erected in relatively small outdoor spaces. The Hyde Park senior playground was the brainchild of Madeline Elsdon, of The Knightsbridge Association. It cost a total of £50,000 with £40,000 being provided by Westminster Council and £10,000 from the Park. Madeline lists its advantages as being, \"No annoying thumpy gym music, absolutely no Lycra and no under-15s.\" In the five years since it opened, it has also gained a reputation as a dating area for seniors. \"You are never going to build muscles using this gym,\" says Madeline, \"but you can gently get fit.\" For years, doctors have been recommending regular exercise to their older patients, especially those suffering from diabetes, heart conditions and obesity, but take up has been low. The main reason for this is that older people unused to a standard gym are nervous of going there for the first time, and are also worried about injuries. This age group is also, generally speaking, not too keen either to expose wrinkles and rolls of fat. With these outdoor playgrounds, they don’t have to. They can just enjoy themselves among like-minded worker-outers. Although there has been talk of other senior playgrounds opening in the UK, so far this has not happened, partly because the idea is still not taken all that seriously and for some the thought of old people working out on big versions of children’s playground equipment still seems laughable. And there were snorts of derision when the idea was raised recently for one in Queen’s Park, Sydney. But although such parks are relatively new in the West, they have been in existence for many years in Hong Kong and China, where nobody laughs, because older people are respected and catered for, rather than being marginalized. It is an attitude we could usefully take to heart. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegoodlife", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-19T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-19T10:34:30.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
