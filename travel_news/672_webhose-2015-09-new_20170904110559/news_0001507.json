Peter Alan Charles Baldwin was born on February 19 1927 in Wood Green, north London. After attending King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford, he trained as a REME radio technician at the Army Training School, Arborfield, Berkshire. In 1945, he was posted to the Sudan and then returned to England to attend OCTU at Mons, Aldershot. He was awarded the Cane of Honour and commissioned into the Royal Corps of Signals. Following a posting to a signal regiment at Herford, BAOR, he commanded 16 High Speed Wireless Troop in Berlin. The Soviets closed road and rail access to the British and American zones for about 11 months and more than two million tons of supplies had to be brought in by air. Baldwin’s troop was involved in round-the-clock operations at RAF Gatow. He was in Hong Kong in command of a signal troop when the Korean War broke out. He was ordered to Pusan with 38 Brigade Signal Troop, part of the US 24 Division. He slept in a tent next to the Signal Centre and so received early notice if a move was imminent. On one occasion, during a difficult period, a brigadier telephoned: “My God!” he exclaimed. “Is there an idiot on this line?” “Not at this end, sir,” the signalman replied. After the ceasefire, he was posted to 1 Wireless Regiment, at Munster, BAOR. On coming back to England, he was in the middle of the examination to enter Staff College when he was told that one of his lungs had tested positive for tuberculosis; he took the remaining papers in a screened-off section of the Woolwich Hospital. Surgery left him with only one good lung but, after a spell at the War Office, he went on to Staff College. A posting to 7 Signal Regiment as adjutant and another stint at the War Office were followed by command of 5 Infantry Brigade and deployment to Borneo in the final phase of the “Confrontation” with Indonesia. He was mentioned in despatches. Baldwin served as a member of the Directing Staff at the Army Staff College and then assumed command of 13 Signal Regiment at Birgelen, BAOR. In 1971 he moved to Rome on his appointment as secretary to the Nato Defence College. Promoted to brigadier in 1974, he commanded 2 Signal Group at Aldershot and subsequently held a staff appointment at HQ Allied Forces Central Europe in Holland. At the Farewell Parade in honour of General Al Haig, the Supreme Allied Commando Nato, Baldwin had the exacting task of ensuring that the drill movements and words of command were understood by all seven nations. His final posting saw him promoted to major general and appointed Chief Signal Officer BAOR at Joint HQ, Rheindahlen. Baldwin retired from the Army in 1979 and became deputy director of radio for the Independent Broadcasting Authority. He was chief executive of the Radio Authority from 1991 to 1995. During his time in these posts, he met many prominent figures in the entertainment business. He was appointed CBE in 1994. The following year, he retired for the second time but worked as a consultant to the Thompson Foundation. He was involved in several charities including Crimestoppers and the Eyeless Trust, and was an associate member of the D’Oyly Carte Opera Trust. He and his wife enjoyed travelling, visiting friends all over the world and attending musical events. Peter Baldwin married, first, in 1953, Judith Mace; the marriage was dissolved. In 1982 he married, secondly, Gail Roberts, who survives him with two stepsons.
