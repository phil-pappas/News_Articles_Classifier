Following William from his long involvement in the NAACP, to his aggressive confrontation of red-lining, to his role coordinating Jesse Jackson’s presidential campaign in 1980s New York, Adventures from the Ghetto to the Mainstream is a rare, firsthand account of a man’s ascent into leadership during one of America’s most turbulent eras. “I want to share my experiences regarding the social challenges I faced and, ultimately, enhance the lives of others,” shares William.\nHaving grown up in New York alongside the emergence of the Civil Rights Movement, William’s autobiography offers a fresh perspective of the movement as well as the years preceding it. Shaking hands with iconic figures like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, and later working beside iconic leaders such as the Reverend Al Sharpton, Adventures from the Ghetto to the Mainstream plants readers firmly within the movement, showing them a side of the Civil Rights Era previously unimagined.\nAdventures from the Ghetto to the Mainstream will be available on Amazon.com October 1st.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T20:06:20.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
