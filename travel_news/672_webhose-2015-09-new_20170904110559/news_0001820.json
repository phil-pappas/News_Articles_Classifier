Massive sell-offs in the media sector have taken television and film studio stocks to the slaughterhouse in recent weeks, but the price plunge has created compelling opportunities in the Knoxville, Tenn-based owner of HGTV and the Food Network . \nRecent sector-wide declines has Scripps Networks trading at 12.6 times earnings, its lowest level in four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares are down 30% in 2015 to $53.16 while nearly half of analyst price targets set by firms led by Argus Research and Needham forecast the stock to rise to $100 over the next 12 months. Scripps Networks has lost tanked 20% over the past three months as investors have exited media companies tied to the traditional pay-TV bundle for fear that Internet-based bundles such as HBO Now, Netflix ( NFLX - Get Report ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) Prime will forever weaken standalone networks such as those owned by Scripps Interactive. \nYet Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich counters that Scripps Networks, with a market cap of $6.8 billion, is positioned to outpace its larger rivals 21st Century Fox ( FOXA - Get Report ) , Discovery Communications ( DISCA - Get Report ) and Time Warner ( TWX - Get Report ) as fees from pay-TV operators increase. Like Scripps, all three have taken a beating in recent week with Fox falling 19% over the past three months, Discovery down 17% and Time Warner also having declined 19%. Scripps' brands like HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel provide leverage to attract upscale audiences coveted by advertising firms, Diedrich said, also citing the company's healthy debt levels as reason for buying the shares. \n\"We feel good about their cash flow -- this is one of the most profitable companies in media,\" Diedrich said in a phone interview. \nScripps did expand its debt when it recently snapped up Poland's largest television network TVN for $843 million, boosting Scripps revenue stream to 17% international exposure from 3% international exposure. Like Scripps, TVN's networks target higher-income, female-skewed viewers. But the acquisition was a deal analysts like Needham's Laura Martin call a good strategic fit. \nMartin, who has a buy rating on Scripps Interactive, said her bullish case also rests in the company's margins, which are \"the highest profit margins among the content companies we cover,\" she said in a preview to the company's second-quarter earnings release in July. \nAs for the massive media stocks sell-offs, the market may have been \"premature in its summary execution of all cable network stocks, especially Buy-rated Scripps Networks,\" said Wunderlich analyst Matthew Harrigan in an Aug. 25 note. With a $90-per-share price target, Harrigan said the today's rock-bottom prices put SNI at such a discount they can already account for no advertising growth through 2019. \nAnother plus for Scripps: new management changes, Harrigan says. Kathleen Finch was recently named Chief Programming, Content and Brand Officer overseeing all brands after delivering record ratings with innovative content at HGTV, DIY Network and Great American Country. \nScripps last month reported a \"very strong quarter versus expectations,\" Dierich said of a quarter where advertising grew 1% versus no growth the year prior. Adjusted net income was up 17% year-over year. \"We view the financial position of Scripps Networks as solid and as having good flexibility even after the recent increase in debt from the acquisition of TVN,\" Diedrich wrote in a Sept. 3 note. \"Scripps generates ample cash and has the flexibility to make small acquisitions, repurchase its shares, increase dividends and repay debt.\" \nThis article is commentary by an independent contributor.
