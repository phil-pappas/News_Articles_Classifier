'Something like this, when you talk to airline people, they say 'How does this happen? This can’t happen?'' \nAmerican Airlines did not shed light on how the snafu happened but told the outlet that it immediately upgraded its software so that the correct plane is matched to the correct route.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T04:10:55.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
