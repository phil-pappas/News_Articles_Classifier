The speed restriction will provide users with extra time to cross if a train is approaching.\n“We are committed to working with the local council and residents to find a permanent solution. In the meantime I urge everyone to always use the crossing in the correct way and not put themselves or others at risk by misusing it.”Network Rail will look at all available options to provide an alternative way to cross the railway and will provide further information as soon as it is available.\nSource:-Network Rail", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-10T07:09:08.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
