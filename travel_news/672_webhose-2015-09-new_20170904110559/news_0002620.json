One year later, the Company is reaping the benefits of its efforts and has recorded significant progress in terms of customer satisfaction. In June 2015, Air France received two awards from Skytrax: World’s Most Improved Airline and, for the second consecutive year, Best First Class Airline Lounge Dining. These awards were presented to the Company at the World Airline Awards, an opportunity for Skytrax to issue a ranking which is a reference in the field of air transport. Both awards received by Air France are the result of a satisfaction survey, carried out online with close to 19 million customers.\nAIR FRANCE’S MOST PRESTIGIOUS CABINS\nIn the new La Première cabin, La Première guests each have a designer suite, ensuring optimum privacy. Air France has dressed each suite with thick curtains, held back with leather tiebacks. A unique and daring concept, they enable the passenger to decide whether to be totally isolated or just partially. In an instant, the La Première seat turns into a fully-flat bed over two metres long. When the guest is ready to go to sleep, the crew members place a mattress on the seat, for impeccable comfort. They then have a large fluffy pillow and a Sofitel MyBed® duvet. With the curtains closed, the partition raised and soft lighting, the suite embraces the passenger, for complete privacy.\nIn the Business cabin, Air France has designed a real cocoon in the sky. The seat adapts to the shape of each individual, from seating position to a real 2-metre long bed. At the heart of the curved structure, each passenger creates their own space, enveloping and protective, according to their desires. The seat’s soft foam is designed to offer impeccable quality of sleep. The bed’s enveloping and padded headboard conveys an impression of being in a warm, contemporary room, a signature feature of Air France seats. With a soft duvet and XXL-sized feather down pillow, everything has been designed to ensure peaceful sleep among the clouds.\nIn Premium Economy, more comfortable seat cushions and a multi-position footrest further enhance this travel cabin. In Economy class, there is a new fully-revised seat, with more legroom, a new seat cushion, more comfortable headrests and a wider tray table. The seat has been ergonomically-redesigned to guarantee optimum comfort. The seat also features new functionalities including an electric socket and a headphones holder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-16T10:42:27.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
