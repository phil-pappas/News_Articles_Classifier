Panglao Island, Bohol. Source: Getty Images \nIF THE marketing men think, ‘It’s more fun in the Philippines’, then they obviously haven’t been stand-up paddle boarding in pelting rain on the Loboc River. \nThat’s what I’m thinking as, drenched and dishevelled, I spot tourists gathering on the bank in the belief, it seems, that my predicament might make a good photo. \nSuch is my introduction to Bohol, ‘The Island of Friendship’, in the Philippines. \nThe Philippines is an archipelago of approximately 7,000 isles to the south and east of mainland Asia. It’s known for its white sand beaches, clear water and dive sites, but Bohol also has heritage and culture. \nThe island and its tiny neighbour, Panglao (the two are linked by a bridge), are in the central Visayas region, just over an hour’s flight from the capital, Manila, in the north. You can sunbathe, sightsee — and even stand-up paddle board. \nAs the sky clears, my instructor, Troy, and I paddle through dripping rainforest to the small Busay Falls. Clearings reveal patterned huts, woven from banana leaves. A man, fishing for tilapia, drops a line from a bamboo pontoon. There’s the smell of meat cooking on hot coals. \nSuddenly a coconut plops into the water; I jump and joke about crocs. \n“There aren’t crocodiles but there are iguana,” Troy says, sounding excited. He tells me they taste like chicken but are tricky to catch. \nBut it’s another form of wildlife for which Bohol is known; it’s the Philippine tarsier, said to have inspired Yoda in Star Wars. The nocturnal, fist-sized creature is among the smallest primates in the world. Its eyes cover three quarters of its head and it has an exceptionally long ‘middle finger’ (tarsus bone), hence its name. You looking at me?

Amazingly, I’m in luck; clinging with its sucker-tipped hands to a narrow branch, I spot a shy fellow snoozing. It opens its goggle eyes and almost seems to smile. \nLater, I meet “Tarsier Man” (aka Carlito Pizarras), who opened the sanctuary. He tells me the animals’ habitats are being destroyed by agriculture and development and that they commit suicide by holding their breath if they’re kept in captivity. From Corella, I head to Carmen, in the centre of the island, for something equally as odd — Bohol’s Chocolate Hills. There are about 1,000 of these conical, 40m mounds, named because they resemble giant chocolate drops when vegetation dies back from November to April. The Chocolate Hills.

One focuses on a giant who fell in love with a mortal, and in grabbing her from her lover on her wedding day, squashed and killed her in his palm. The hills are his calcified tears. \nOn my way back to Panglao, where I’m staying, I stop at Baclayon Catholic Church, built by Spanish missionaries in 1595. \nLuckily, it’s time for something cheery. A local worshipper, Gigie Javier, shows me the church’s prized possession — a cabinet containing statues of the holy family. The glass front has a large hole from a Japanese bomb blast in WWII. \nGigie asks me why I think the statues weren’t damaged — it’s clear they should have been. \n“They weren’t touched because that’s how miracles work!” she proclaims.

Bangka (outrigger canoes) with tarpaulins straddle the sea like giant water boatmen. I wake up early and go for a dip; the water’s ridiculously warm. \nThe Philippines is hot, humid and tropical, and even in the wet season, torrential downpours don’t clear the air. I enjoy island-hopping but sightseeing is a sweaty business, especially in Manila. \nThe capital’s traffic is notorious; roads are regularly gridlocked. But the super-polished, chrome jeepneys, packed with passengers and daubed with slogans, are a travel highlight. It costs just 8 pesos (approx 11p) for a 4km journey. \nJeepneys are former US army jeeps, left behind after WWII. \nLocals converted them into buses and decorated them with spiritual slogans and graffiti-style art. \nI catch up with a local guide, Angelo Alon, for a tour of Intramuros, Manila’s historic quarter, which was originally built by the Spanish. The district was destroyed in WWII but has since been restored, with the old citadel, Fort Santiago, forming the centrepiece. \nNearby is San Agustin church, the only building in Intramuros that survived the war. By the entrance, there are two dragons, incorporated into the design as a gesture of thanks to the city’s Chinese community who helped fund the building. \nFrom Manila, it’s a short flight southwest to Busuanga in the island province of Palawan, for a relaxing end to my stay. \nI catch a boat to the privately-owned Dicilingan Island, occupied solely by the Huma Island Resort and Spa. I’m welcomed with garlands and song, and dine on locally-caught lapu lapu, meat from pearl oysters and cassava cake made from a grated root vegetable, eggs and coconut milk. \nThere’s certainly plenty of picture opportunities if you want to Instagram, and while Huma bills itself as luxury, the focus is on fun. With karaoke — a Filipino obsession — in the bar, nights are dedicated to Kylie and cocktails. \nBut days are your own. I take a boat trip to nearby Black Island to snorkel among clown fish and coral; I kayak off the beach at Huma and have a massage. \nOn my last night, I’m cajoled into karaoke. A group of us join the in-house musicians for a rendition of a song of their choice, accompanied by guitar and an egg maraca. We’re so bad, everyone’s in stitches. \n“Killing me softly” I croak, “with this song”, and can’t help seeing the funny side. Maybe it is more fun in the Philippines, after all.
