Through one-year research and development, Fosjoas twin-wheeled scooters come out in the market. Moben Global Inc has rolled out three twin-wheeled models by sequence: V3, V5 and V8. They bring the ultimate design and awesome cycling experience to users. China, 30 September 2015 -- Fosjoas intelligent twin-wheeled scooters have inherited the great performance of the one-wheeled scooters. They still apply the Japan-made lithium batteries, renowned Cheng Shin Tyres, and synthetic resin shells which are made of craft-grade nano-material. The flexible cycling on Fosjoas twin-scooters depends on the smart chips inside. They have used aerospace attitude control theory, fuzzy software algorithm and gyroscope system to keep self-balancing.What’s more, Fosjoas industrial designers adopted the twin-wheeled structure in self-balancing scooters for the first time. Compared with the single-wheeled structure, the twin-wheeled structure is firmer and stronger. The wider the contact area between twin-wheel and the ground is, the trips on Fosjoas twin-wheeled scooters will be smoother. As a result, it is much easier to learn riding a twin-wheeled self-balancing scooter than unicycles. It only takes users 5 minutes on average to learn. Owing to safe cycling experiences and ease of learning, freshmen always prefer choosing Fosjoas twin-wheeled electric scooters than single-wheeled ones. Fosjoas has added some fresh elements to design twin-wheeled scooters, such as neon lights, circular pedals, shin guards silicone pads, auxiliary support and so on. Neon lights on Fosjoas twin-wheeled scooters make users more fashionable and cooler, especially in the evenings. Circular pedals and silicone pads decrease the occurrence of users’ unexpected injuries while cycling. In addition, Fosjoas twin-wheeled scooters are more portable than other ones. They are equipped with removable auxiliary supports. So users can stop them in any places. Fosjoas twin-wheeled electric scooters provide users with fantastic cycling experience. They’re born to roll. V3, V5 and V8, choose one and have a try with the new vehicle! # # #", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T13:50:21.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
