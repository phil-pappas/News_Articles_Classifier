Our customers will notice a real difference on board this revolutionary aircraft”, said Bob Schumacher, United’s Managing Director Sales – U.K. & Ireland. “This will be our third Dreamliner flying from Heathrow, as we already operate two 787-8s on our Houston route.” Flight UA935 departs London Heathrow at 10:35 a.m., arriving in Los Angeles at 1:50 p.m. the same day. The return flight, UA934, departs Los Angeles at 5:45 p.m., arriving in London at 12:15 p.m. the following day (all times local).
