Ranging from the loud to the meditative, from the lengthy to the momentary, they all share one thing — they let you know you're in Arizona.\nHere are five favorite \"Only in Arizona\" experiences.\nShootout at the O.K. Corral\nOn Oct. 26, 1881, Doc Holliday pulled back the hammer of his shotgun. The metallic click still reverberates today.\nWhat happened in the next 30 seconds would launch a reputation and, eventually, a tourism industry. Tombstone and Arizona would forever be linked to the Wild West thanks to the shootout at the O.K. Corral (which actually occurred in a vacant lot next to the corral).\nAZCENTRAL\nTop 10 places to experience the Old West in Arizona\nThat event, a landmark of violent behavior, now plays out at noon, 2 and 3:30 p.m. It ends the same way each time, with three dead and the opportunity to buy O.K. Corral souvenirs.\nHighlight: The choreographed stunts of men shooting blanks.\nLowlight: Commercialization, from T-shirts to refrigerator magnets to shot glasses. (Let the irony of that last one sink in.)\nDon't miss: The Tombstone Historama, which is included in the $10 admission price. As spotlights illuminate a three-dimensional display of the town's history (it's history, it's a diorama, it's Historama!), the menacing tones of Vincent Price walk you through how \"the town too tough to die\" survived.\nInstagram opportunity: Keep the phone aimed on your chosen participant (Wyatt Earp is popular) and fire away, so to speak. Extra points for capturing gunsmoke.\nIconic moment: When the gunslingers arrive, staring at one another until the first weapon is fired and all (staged) hell breaks loose.\nOverheard: \"Guys had short tempers in those days.\"\nSuggested tweet: \"Fans of the Clanton boys should call this 'The Not OK Corral' #deadagain.\"\nAZCENTRAL\nLive in Arizona? 5 spots you need to see\nMonument Valley is a striking region near the Utah/Arizona border characterised by huge sandstone buttes which can reach up to 1000ft in height. Often used as a film set, the valley is within the bord\nSunrise in Monument Valley\nUnder the gift of cloudless skies, it starts with a hemisphere of purple emerging over the horizon.\nThe light evolves from red to orange to yellow. The sun bubbles forth, its rays racing along the desert floor before colliding with vast columns of stone. The buttes and pillars glow red as if molten lava were frozen in time. But as the minutes pass and the Earth turns, that magical moment grows more mundane, with long shadows receding like the tide.\nStill, there is plenty of time to capture photos guaranteed to impress on social media. Your Twitter, Instagram and Facebook feeds will glow with warm comments, and the best shots can be your electronic wallpaper for years to come.\nAZCENTRAL\nDescribe Arizona? Here are 10 icons\nHighlight: Reserve a seat in a Navajo-run sunrise tour for a close-up look at the Totem Pole, the most prominent of several cliffs and pillars carved over eons by water and wind.\nLowlight: Waking mid-morning because your alarm didn't go off.\nDon't miss: The panoramic view from the visitor center. If it's your first trip to Monument Valley, this is a great place to watch the sunrise.\nInstagram opportunity: Start shooting the second the sun peeks over the horizon. The warm, rich light will last roughly 30 minutes. If your camera has panorama mode, be sure to use it.\nIconic moment: The desert appears to be on fire once the sun has barely cleared the horizon. At some point, put the camera down and enjoy.\nOverheard: \"You were right. It's even more incredible now.\"\nSuggested tweet: \"You expect to see John Wayne ride up at any second.\"\nSedona vortex tour\nRed-rock country is blessed with more than scenery, according to those in tune with psychic energy. Sedona also is home to mystical spots where energy spirals from the Earth, creating vortexes than can cleanse, heal and recharge those who stand in their midst.\nOr it's a bunch of hooey, depending on your beliefs.\nAZCENTRAL\nEasy Arizona routes for mountain-biking newbies\nThe beauty of a vortex tour is that these psychic whirlwinds occur in some of Sedona's most scenic spots. No need to feel a vibe when you're gazing at Red Rock Crossing in the shadow of Cathedral Rock — the buttes and pillars that seem to defy gravity will send chills up your spine.\nOther vortexes are known (or said) to be near the airport, Boynton Canyon and Bell Rock. Thus, vortex tours show off Sedona's best sides, whether mental or physical.\nHighlight: Despite the uninspired description, the airport vortex offers one of the best views of Sedona's red-rock basin. Whether or not you feel the energy, you'll want to linger.\nLowlight: To feel the vortex, you must be in a relaxed state with an open mind. With each Facebook post, you decrease vortex awareness.\nDon't miss: The chance to de-stress. Tours involve easy to moderate hiking, and many include time for a leisurely lunch. You don't need to feel the vortex to chill out.\nInstagram opportunity: Each vortex stop has excellent photo opportunities, though you may receive disapproving looks from guides who likely have asked you to put away your phone.\nIconic moment: Could that subtle vibration from deep within you be a sign that your spiritual energy is mingling with that of the vortex? Or maybe you're just hungry.\nOverheard: \"Not everyone picks up on the energy. Don't blame yourself if you're not in tune right now.\"\nSuggested tweet: \"Psychic energy is strong, cell signal not so much.\"\nGuided tour, Canyon de Chelly\nThere are two ways to experience Arizona's lesser-known grand canyon. You may drive along the rim, stopping at overlooks to marvel at the vertical cliffs and stone spires that seem otherworldly.\nOr, should you want to do more than scrape the surface, you can arrange a Navajo-guided tour to explore the canyon and the life within it.\nNative people have lived within Canyon de Chelly's walls for centuries. Many Navajos still live there full- or part-time. You are likely to meet shepherds and weavers while you marvel at the sights.\nAZCENTRAL\nFree days at national parks, forests in 2015\nA guided tour also offers the only way to see the canyon from its floor, where you'll find a mix of creek bed and meadow interrupted by thick stands of trees. The cliffs soar almost out of sight, allowing for a sense of grandeur not so evident from the rim.\nHighlight: The people. One sheep herder opened her home to visitors, happy to answer questions before giving a quick shearing demonstration. You may find people tending orchards or rounding up cattle.\nLowlight: You'll cringe if members of your party ask insensitive questions about life off the grid.\nDon't miss: The White House Ruins. Long ago, hundreds of people lived in the structure built into the cliffs. Now the walls are a reminder of how life once thrived in the canyon.\nInstagram opportunity: Stand at the base of Spider Rock, a sturdy pillar that branches into two graceful columns. From the shadows, shoot toward the top as the column blots out the sun, lending a lofty perspective to the towers of stone.\nIconic moment: Driving into the mouth of the canyon, cliffs rising rapidly on either side.\nOverheard: \"Hello!\" A cascading echo follows and slowly dies away.\nSuggested tweet: \"People still live here, and I can see why.\"\nGrand Canyon mule ride\nThe question you must ask yourself is, \"Do I trust a beast's sense of self-preservation as it makes its way along narrow ledges with steep drop-offs?\" The short answer is yes, given the solid safety record of the sure-footed mules dating back to 1887 when rides were first offered.\nThe slow and steady ride offers advantages in addition to the freedom to gaze at the scenery rather than gluing your eyes to the trail. While hikers sweat, you ride in relative comfort, with mules bearing the burden of your backpack.\nAZCENTRAL\nTop 10 trail rides in Arizona\nReservations are taken up to 13 months in advance, and slots fill quickly. Two three-hour tours are offered daily in summer and early fall, and once each day in the off-peak season. Overnight rides to Phantom Ranch, as well as two-night rides, also are offered. You can also reserve a mule ride on the North Rim from May 15 to Oct. 15.\nEven better? You don't have to clean up after your mule.\nHighlight: You'll clench the reins tightly as the trail narrows, your mule seemingly inches from disaster. Even as a chill runs up your spine, the mule clip-clops onward as it always has.\nLowlight: When the mule in front of you answers nature's inevitable call, be happy you're riding and not walking.\nDon't miss: The scenery. Every bend reveals something new. The view from atop a mule is the same as if you were hiking, but there is smug satisfaction knowing you won't be the one huffing and puffing on the way back up.\nInstagram opportunity: No matter where you point your camera, there is an image worth posting. Just don't allow your desire to share (and boast) overwhelm the moment. The Canyon's scope can never be appreciated through a viewfinder.\nIconic moment: As you swing your leg over the mule and settle into the saddle, all you can think is, \"I'm about to ride a mule into the Grand Canyon. How cool is that?\" Very cool indeed.\nOverheard: \"You're not going to fall, right? Take your time, girl, I'm in no hurry.\"\nSuggested tweet: \"I'm on a burro in the Grand Canyon. How cool is that?\"\nOther 'Only in Arizona' moments\nCopper Queen mine tour, Bisbee: Delve into history, and inky blackness, aboard mining cars that go 1,500 feet into the underground mine. Enjoy the year-round 47-degree temperature while imagining what it was like to open new tunnels, praying that the walls held.\nRELATED: 3 Arizona mining towns you don't want to miss\nDrinking on Whiskey Row, Prescott: Saloons once lined the 100 block of South Montezuma Street, and a disastrous fire in 1900 leveled the buildings but not the spirit. Start your tour with a shot at the Palace, among the oldest frontier saloons (if not the oldest) in Arizona.\nRELATED: Belly up to the bar: Arizona's best historic saloons\nLunch in Yuma on the way to San Diego: Each summer, Arizona residents flock to San Diego as if it's in their genes. The most popular (and logical) stop for lunch is Yuma, the unofficial halfway point. Few want to linger in the heat, so it's usually the drive-through and then back on the road. You can tell the ones heading back to Arizona by the frowns on their faces.\nFree sticky buns at El Chorro Lodge, Phoenix: A basket of warm sticky buns arrives at the table soon after diners sit down. By the time the meals arrive, no one is as hungry as they were when they entered. You can take leftovers home, assuming there are any.\nPie at Rock Springs: The Rock Springs Café is a popular rest stop for those driving to and from Flagstaff, mostly for its array of delicious pies. The café had been under new ownership for a few years, but the pies are just as good. If you're not in the mood for an entire pie, head to the back and buy by the slice. You can order a la mode as well, and clerks will be happy to warm it in the microwave.", "external_links": ["http://azc.cc/1bflvXu", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/577f8a50297014fd2c244d09581dff52e1a8ea12/c=300-0-1500-1200/local/-/media/2015/01/05/Phoenix/Phoenix/635560556715645200-phxdc5-684rec44qiaz90tjen6-original.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f97d887710cf164ab19a61d2cf0c5ba145a1608c/c=287-0-1169-882/local/-/media/2015/05/07/Phoenix/Phoenix/635666189767658764-Mission-San-Xavier.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/89d28dbb34247e88e9a00947d837e668be5fe729/c=338-0-1663-1325/local/-/media/2015/04/03/Phoenix/Phoenix/635636551574144005-phxdc5-6cdmwqtuoxki48in74y-original.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e04e452736dcd74bb19b8a9364a426c7736ace50/c=1221-0-3240-2019/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/08/23/1408823096000-phxdc5-5gmu2itclle1myxc8ni1-original.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1910aacbed140abbd6725f095febec096633433/c=0-100-2000-1225&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/06/30/Phoenix/B9317780622Z.1_20150630193016_000_G0CB6JNFA.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12ab58a71d3915ae8d8d36c748a7b7e4976a105a/r=540&c=540x304/http/pthumbnails.5min.com/10374303/518715105_c_embedStandard.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cfd01b4e1a3faa73a4834598cb2c5678a44daaae/c=204-0-1428-1224/local/-/media/2015/06/26/Phoenix/B9317567594Z.1_20150626204416_000_GHKAVF837.2-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44718bc186ef2bf2a2929512c8afc7138da5ab6b/c=648-0-3240-2592/local/-/media/Phoenix/2015/01/12/B9315812022Z.1_20150112152629_000_GVM9LHG76.1-0.jpg", "http://pthumbnails.5min.com/10374303/518715105_c_embedStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-28T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T02:20:37.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
