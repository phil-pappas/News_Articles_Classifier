The deals will see Motorcycle Live return to the NEC for the next three years, with The Ticket Factory as the show’s official ticketing agent. Motorcycle Live has a long standing relationship with the NEC Group, having worked with both the NEC and The Ticket Factory for over 10 years. \nThe latest commitment by the organisers demonstrates their confidence in both the venue and ticketing agent to help to continue to deliver great live events and further enhances the Group’s reputation as one of the world’s top venue management companies. Finlay McAllan, Managing Director of Motorcycle Live, said: “Our decision to stay with the NEC Group was a simple one. The NEC is the UK’s number one venue and is not only ideal because of the flexibility it offers us, but there is also a fantastic team behind the scenes that we work closely with to identify areas where we can enhance the experience of our visitors year on year. “Similarly, the team at The Ticket Factory is always bringing new ideas to the table and always looking for new ways to make the ticketing process fast and seamless so we know we are in capable hands. Having worked with them for a number of years now and the fact that they know our show so well, along with their continued market growth it made sense for us to form a long-term relationship with them.” Motorcycle Live currently spends nine consecutive days at the NEC making it the venue’s longest show tenancy. Charlotte Careswell, NEC Account Manager, said: “We are thrilled to have extended our relationship with Motorcycle Live. The show attracts a national audience so our location in the heart of the country means that we are easily accessible for those travelling to the show from across the UK. The opening of Resorts World on our site in 2015 will also create a 24/7 destination meaning that visitors will have more to do on site into the evening which will prove particularly beneficial for visitors attending the show for more than one day.” Leading Ticket agency, The Ticket Factory is leading the way in ticketing innovation by giving customers the option to purchase their tickets through PayPal and to enable them to login to their accounts using their social media channels. Sarah Whittaker, The Ticket Factory’s Sales Director, said: “As a Group, we are extremely excited to have Motorcycle Live joining us as one of our long-term clients, and are confident that they will enjoy the benefits of our continued investments into the customer experience. “We’ve invested in a great team of developers to help sell more tickets online, and this deal will enable us to work more closely with the organisers to identify areas where we can add value and help sell more tickets than ever before, at the same time making it easier for customers to buy.” This year’s Motorcycle Live event will take place at the NEC in Birmingham on from the 28th November until the 6th December.
