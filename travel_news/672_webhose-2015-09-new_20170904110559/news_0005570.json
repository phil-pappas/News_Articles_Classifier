The center broke ground in early 2014.\n“This new research center will help us better meet the needs of our customers by enhancing our ability to provide effective, relevant technology in today’s competitive marketplace as we enter our second century of business,” said John Tracy, Boeing chief technology officer and senior vice president of Engineering, Operations & Technology.\nThe state-of-the-art center includes lab spaces where scientists and engineers research and develop technologies in advanced production systems; nondestructive evaluation and inspection; production analytics and advanced test systems; structural repair technologies; electromagnetic effects; chemical technology; and composite fabrication and materials. The center also includes two autoclaves, which are used to cure parts made from composite materials; a paint booth with automation capabilities; and a clean room to combine composite layers together.\n“The people and facilities we’re introducing today will help us apply new technology and solutions to our products across the entire company faster and more efficiently than ever before,” said Lane Ballard, leader of the Boeing Research & Technology-South Carolina center.\n“Increasing our research and development footprint here demonstrates our continued commitment to the state of South Carolina, and will help Boeing and the region attract, develop and retain the best talent in the industry,” said Beverly Wyse, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina.\nBR&T is the company’s advanced research and development organization, providing technologies that enable the development of future aerospace solutions while improving the cycle time, cost, quality and performance of existing Boeing products and services. BR&T-South Carolina joins the company’s 10 other research centers around the world in Australia, Brazil, China, Europe, India, Russia and the United States, including Alabama, California, Missouri, South Carolina and Washington.\nSource:- Boeing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T20:41:18.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
