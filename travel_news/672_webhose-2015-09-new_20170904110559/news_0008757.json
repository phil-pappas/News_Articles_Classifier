Tickets are now available at Amtrak.com, the Amtrak mobile apps and other booking channels.\nTrain # 2295 is a new morning departure from Boston, leaving South Station at 7:35 a.m.\nwith a scheduled arrival at Penn Station New York at 11:15 a.m. This Saturday-only service\nprovides additional flexibility and convenience for customers when making their travel plans.\nA new northbound train (#2260) will depart New York at 4:55 p.m., providing passengers\nwith an evening travel option to Boston.\n“These additional trains reflect the value passengers place on safe, reliable, high-speed\nservice on the Northeast Corridor,” said Mike DeCataldo, Senior Vice President and General\nManager of Northeast Corridor Operations. “Our passengers want more service and more\nfrequent travel options and wherever we can accommodate that demand we’re going to do it.”\nIn an effort to meet the increasing demand for high-speed rail service and provide\nadditional capacity on the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak is also working to acquire new trainsets that will supplement and eventually replace the existing Acela equipment.\nSource:- Amtrak", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-05T23:09:24.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
