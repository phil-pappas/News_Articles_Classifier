Pupils may have only recently returned to school but already stories are emerging. This week #GoodnewsFriday features everything from record breaking Meccano bridges to Tatler Awards. In the news this week, the chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, claimed unruly pupils deter would-be teachers , the annual QS world university rankings were published and Scottish universities warned that proposed legislation puts £900 million of their funding at risk . One survey proclaimed the death of letter writing among younger generations , while Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary, said the Conservatives were the \"the heirs to Blair\" on education and warned Corbyn’s Labour party presented a risk to British schools due to their opposition to free schools. Elsewhere, budding entrepreneurs at Bolton School raised funds for a Nepalese earthquake relief fund, a 14-year-old schoolboy has been tasked with teaching Brussels-based MEPs how to code and Queen’s College students enjoyed a day amongst musical royalty. Read on to find out more. 1. Schoolboy \"ninja\" tasked with teaching MEPs how to code Schoolboy, Louis de Wardt, aged 14, is preparing for a trip to the European Parliament at the end of this month to teach coding to MEPs from across the continent. Louis, who attends independent school, Brighton College, is a member of Coder Dojo, a free programming and technology club that has more than 700 branches worldwide. The organisation was set up in 2011 following various studies showing a shortage of programmers. It is entirely organised by volunteers keen to encourage young people to code and develop websites, apps and programmes. The children, aged 7-17, are usually referred to as “ninjas” and they complete activities and earn “belts” as their skills grow. Louis is one of six young ninjas across the whole of the UK hand-picked to go to Brussels by Coder Dojo. Louis de Wardt is preparing for the trip to the European Parliament Louis said: “I started coding when I was in Year 6. I’ve always loved computers but when I joined an after school club I really starting getting serious about coding. I just love the problem solving element of it. Now I teach other children, but I suppose it is going to be a bit different teaching MEPs from scratch.” His Coder Dojo club leader, Johnny Claffey, added: “Louis was picked for this because he is really out there when it comes to coding. He isn’t afraid of anything, he’ll just pick it up and run with it. He’s even taught code to staff at Thomson Reuters. He runs the advanced track at his club, helping others with processing, Java Script and Python. These kids are at the forefront of this digital age.\" 2. Queen Margaret’s fends off competition to gain Tatler award Queen Margaret’s, York, was awarded the UK’s Best School Food at the Tatler Awards in London. The award is based on food hygiene, menu ideas, presentation and, of course, the taste. Previous winners of this award include St George’s, Ascot and Harrow. The menu at Queen Margaret’s includes sweet chilli and lime chicken, roast beef and glazed halloumi with vegetable skewers. All puddings, biscuits and pastries are baked within the school’s kitchens. Seasonal food includes hog roast barbecues on the terrace in summer and themed lunches throughout the academic year. Seasonal food includes hog roast barbecues on the terrace in summer Jessica Miles, the head teacher, commented: “Food is an extremely important part of school life. At the heart of a Queen Margaret’s education is a love of learning, which is supported by a healthy body and healthy mind … Gone are the days of the old fashioned school meal.” Shaun Gayton, catering manager, said: “The team at Queen Margaret’s is very proud to have won this award for the local area and for Yorkshire. The Yorkshire landscape provides the perfect environment for sourcing seafood from the coast, to rhubarb from the Wakefield Rhubarb Triangle, to meat and poultry from the Dales. Thank you to all our local suppliers.” 3. Schoolchildren have world record in their sights On Saturday, local children (alongside academics and students from Queen’s University Belfast) will test their year-long project – The Big Bridge Build – designing and building a 100ft bridge made entirely of Meccano. They hope it will set a world record for longest Meccano structure in the world. The project caught the eye of Grand Design’s Kevin McCloud who said: “I was excited to see details of what must be the first life-size Meccano bridge in the World. An exemplary feat of engineering. Congratulations”. Dr Danny McPolin, Daisy Murray and Jaime Short Kevin echoed the support of Professor Dame Athene Donald, the next president of the British Science Association and Lord Richard Rogers, the world renowned architect. The scheme aims to encourage more youngsters to engage further with STEM subjects, through a love of construction, and to explore the possibilities of STEM related subjects in higher education. 4. Queen’s College hosts musical royalty Queen’s College, Taunton, hosted a flute masterclass involving recitals from renowned soloist Wissam Boustany, flute specialist Candice Regan and pianist Aleksander Szram. Students were given the opportunity to try piccolos, alto flutes and different head joints while learning from the experts. Wissam and Aleksander held a masterclass ensemble whilst Candice taught students tone and technique. Queen?s College, Taunton, hosted a flute masterclass The recital was held in the College’s Performing Arts Centre and came to an end with a recital from Wissam Boustany, demonstrating his coaching points from earlier in the day. Headmaster Chris Alcock said: “Flute day was a wonderful opportunity for Queen’s students to develop their musical skills by learning from the world famous. The masterclass and the recital were thoroughly enjoyed by all”. 5. Students take part in Entrepreneur Week Towards the latter end of the summer term, Bolton School played host to Entrepreneur Week, with the Year Six boys tasked with raising profit from lunchtime stalls and the winning team choosing which charity received their funds. Winning team ‘Sweet Tooth’ found success with their bags of mixed sweets. ‘Chill Out’ came well equipped for the summer heat with a range of flavoured ice-creams. ‘Tom and Seb’s Mocktails’ also capitalised on the good weather, offering the boys a chance to buy a cool mixed drink and even mix their own. ‘Delicious Cakes’ is reported to have lived up to expectations with an impressive variety of home made cakes. The boys raised an impressive £552.60 in profit The Young Entrepreneurs project aims to provide pupils with key skills such as producing a business plan and sourcing products. Concepts such as profit margins and marketing are introduced to participants, who are split into teams of 11 and given three lunchtimes to sell their goods to fellow students. The boys raised an impressive £552.60 in profit, with ‘Sweet Tooth’ pledging the gains from proceedings to HExN’s Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund. The charity HExN (Health Exchange Nepal) also promotes the exchange of medical knowledge, techniques, health professionals and equipment between Nepal and the UK.
