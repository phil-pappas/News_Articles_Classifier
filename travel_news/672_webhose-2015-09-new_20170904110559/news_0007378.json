We are still seeing a good increase of eight per cent in arrivals, so we are on target to hit 5.2 million footfalls for 2015.” \n\nTourism data shows 2.6 million tourist arrivals in 1H2015, with most coming from North Asia such as South Korea and Japan. \n\nChina, in particular, registered strong growth of 59 per cent month-on-month in July after the Chinese government did away with its travel ban on the Philippines. \n\n“Tour groups have started to pour in. At the moment, we have 14 direct flights to destinations such as Boracay and Cebu from all over China,” Panga said. \n\nDoT’s decision to boost tourism through repeat travellers is based on findings that 60 per cent of visitors to the Philippines have toured the country before. \n\nThe tourism board also intends to drum up interest among specific groups of travellers with its array of events next year. Such events include the ASEAN Tourism Forum and Routes Asia 2016 for business people; Madrid Fusion Manila 2016 for foodies; and 2016 Ironman 70 for music and concert lovers. \n\nSupporting the DoT’s tourism goals, the government will address a route development programme to encourage more flights into the country and lower the barrier of entry for foreign visitors. \n\nPanga said: “Last year we came up with a policy allowing Indian passport holders with (visas from) the US, Japan, Australia, Schengen states and the UK to visit the Philippines and stay for seven days, extendible to 21 days, without a visa.” \n\nThis has resulted in a 27 per cent increase in Indian arrivals so far, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-09T10:02:07.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
