Easily accessible from the lower grounds of The Opposite House and located in the heart of Sanlitun, Beijing’s luxury shopping and commercial district, Bei Space is designed for versatility, with a 180m2 space that can be easily adapted for any event layout, making this multipurpose space an ideal setting for press conferences, banquets, cocktail parties, fashion previews, meetings, conferences and corporate training. \nThe space is also equipped with a moveable projector, overhead screens, and state-of-the-art sound system for seamless audio-visual presentations. Conveniently flanked by The Opposite House’s acclaimed restaurants, full catering is available at Bei Space with a choice of Western fare from Sureño or Chinese delicacies from Jing Yaa Tang. For events requiring multiple spaces, catering from both restaurants can also be requested for The Red Space, situated next to the hotel. Designers Neri&Hu chose to separate the main space from its service areas and outside terrace with transparent walls of custom-made glass bricks, which open up the subterranean space and maximise natural light while providing necessary privacy. Meanwhile, a field of hanging pendant lights encapsulate the main space while leaving it open and flexible. “As the vibrant arts, culture and commercial scene in Sanlitun continues to thrive, our aim is to enhance it with an event venue that exudes understated sophistication on its own, yet can serve as the canvas for highly personalised or creative executions. Events of a fashionable, creative or corporate tone can all find a home at Bei Space,” comments Peter Wynne, Area General Manager of Swire Hotels Beijing and General Manager of The Opposite House.
