The Greenleaf Hotel at Niseko Village on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido offers both an indoor and outdoor onsen for both genders with waters cooled to 40 degrees. Word is the mineral content of the thermal waters have natural healing powers. \nHOT TUBS FOR EVERYONE IN JACKSON HOLE The pool at Amangani in Jackson Hole, Wyoming has won many accolades for the view of the Teton mountain peaks alone.
