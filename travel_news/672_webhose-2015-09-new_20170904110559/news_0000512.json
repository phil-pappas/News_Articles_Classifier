I'll also be meeting with representatives from different destinations across Canada to discover the new attractions travellers will want to discover from coast-to-coast. \nGet live updates from the Okanagan Valley on Twitter by following @canoetravel and check back with blogs.canoe.com/travel for the latest on what's new and exciting in travel across Canada this year.
