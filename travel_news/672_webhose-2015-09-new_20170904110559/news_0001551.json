Share this article Share 551 shares On landing back in the U.S. after only using up half-a-day's holiday, Mr Song had accumulated 141,608 miles.\nHe now plans to spend the miles travelling from the U.S. to Hong Kong to visit his girlfriend in first class on either on Japan Airlines or Cathay Pacific.\nHe worked out he had spent $3,609 on all the flights. The cost of a first class flight, according to Mr Song to Hong Kong would set him back around $28,000. However converting the 141,6008 air miles he racked up means he can put them towards this journey.\nThis map shows just how long Mr Song's cross-Atlantic journey was to accumulate his air miles\nMr Song spent $3,609 on all the flights\nSpeaking to The Points Guy , Mr Song said: 'My 141,608 miles will get me a round-trip in first class (which costs 67,500 miles each way), or nearly three one-ways in business class (which costs 50,000 miles).\n'Cathay Pacific first-class fares are pretty consistent: Right now, the nonstop from JFK to Hong Kong is pricing out at a whopping $28,383.'\nSpeaking to MailOnline Travel, TravelSupermarket.com expert Bob Atkinson said: 'You need to be a frequent flyer to really make this kind of thing work, he's an American Airlines frequent flyer.\n'Essentially the guy has spent money buying tickets and used a range of benefits to minimise the cost of purchase and maximise the way he earns his points PLUS he has protected his ultra-frequent flying rewards status to protect him in the future.\n'Those points give him enough to earn a return flight to HK in first with Cathay Pacific - one of the oneWorld partners who American is affiliated with.\n'It's a fairly extreme way of flying to achieve what he wanted. It appears he was wanting to protect his flying status with AA rather than accrue the miles, however he has managed both.\n'The average punter would not be able to do this as the frequency which most people fly is just not enough to make it worth their while.'\nMr Song is now planning on using his air miles to travel with Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong to see his girlfriend\nRead more: How I Earned 141,608 Miles From a Single Weekend of Flying", "external_links": ["http://dailym.ai/1MT6DwM", "http://thepointsguy.com/2015/08/earned-142k-american-miles/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+thepointsguy+%28The+Points+Guy%29"], "published": "2015-08-29T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T19:30:42.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
