Hundreds of buildings have been destroyed as wildfire in the Lake Country raced through dry bushes and exploded in size.\nOver 1000 firefighters battled to get the blaze under control which has grown as huge as 50,000 acres (78 square miles). More than 19,000 people were evacuated from the area when another wildfire in the south east destroyed 81 homes.\nThe wind gust spread the fire as it reached 30mph and embers flew off on homes making it even more difficult for firefighters to douse the fire. Four firefighters were injured as they tried to control the fire.\nPeople were ordered to evacuate Clear Lake Riviera, a town with about 3,000 residents, and other areas near the blaze. The west side of the town is left with charred appliances and metal garage doors that hardly seem recognisable. The fire erupted on Saturday afternoon about 50 miles (80 kms) west of the state capital, Sacramento, and rapidly chewed through brush and trees parched from several years of drought. Entire towns as well as residents along a 35-mile stretch of highway were evacuated.\nA state of emergency has been declared for the separate 101-square-mile wildfire about 70 miles south-east of Sacramento that has destroyed at least 81 homes and 51 outbuildings and turned the grassy, tree-studded Sierra Nevada foothills an eerie white. Firefighters have cleared bushes around the Grant Grove and kept the flames from overrunning. The treasured trees of Fresno Bee are being protected by the firefighters The dozens of sequoia groves in the Sierra Nevada; some trees are 3,000 years old as tall as 268ft General Grant tree are all within this significantly important grove.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-14T15:21:08.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
