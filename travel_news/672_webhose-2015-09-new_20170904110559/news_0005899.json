In case the restaurant’s name wasn’t a tip-off. \nThe pork rillettes originated at Palmetto Creek Farm in Avon, Fla., which raises “probably the best pigs in the U.S. today,” Mitchell said. And because he wastes nothing in his kitchen, head cheese appears on the dish as well. That’s right: meat from the hog’s head, made into a sort of rustic Old-World pâté. \nJackman Wagyu Beef ranch in Clewiston provides the eye of round for the bresaola. The pickled veggies come from a variety of farms in the Naples area. \n“I take the veggies when there’s plenty and then pickle them,” Mitchell said. Produce suppliers include Worden Farm in Punta Gorda, for whom The Local serves as a Community Supported Agriculture drop site; Herban Gardens in North Fort Myers; distributor Oakes Farm in Naples; and the gardens and backyards of the Mitchells, staff, and other small gardeners. Mitchell works most closely with Inyoni Farm , an organic operation in Naples. \nThe pineapple in moutarda sauce atop the sampler plate’s chicken liver pâté came from Nick Batty at Inyoni. “Nick texts me at the beginning of each week and tells me what he’s got for me,” said Mitchell. \nWhen Mitchell began working with Batty, the chef scouted out seeds for the farmer to grow for him. \nNow Batty and Mitchell have established a rhythm where the farmer knows what the chef wants, and the chef is willing to find uses for what the farmer has in surplus. \n“We tried an eggplant dish that was wonderful,” said Gina Birch, a local writer and radio personality whose The Birch Beat blog covers Southwest Florida’s food and wine scene. “It had a nice smoky flavor with basil and goat cheese to add dimension.” The Turkish eggplant came from a private local gardener. \n“I couldn’t stop eating the bresaola!” said Birch, who also recommends the Butcher’s Cut of Palmetto Creek Farms Pork, a lovely French-boned presentation. Mitchell or another chef drives to Sarasota each week to meet the pork purveyor and bring home a whole hog. What doesn’t get served as chops, shoulder, or an addictive ragu with house-made gnocchi becomes charcuterie at the hands of Mitchell, a Culinary Institute of America-trained chef who opened The Local in 2013. \nWhen Mitchell first bought the restaurant, he tore out the walk-in freezer, replaced it with a refrigerator and a small chest freezer. The only product the freezer holds is the ice cream, sorbet, and granita Mitchell makes to preserve fruit purchases. A shipment of Florida peaches and his server’s backyard mangoes showed up on Birch’s dinner table as granita and sorbet respectively. \n“I loved both of them,” Birch said. “The icy granita had whole chunks of peaches in it – not overly sweet. Delicious! Chef Mitchell is so smart in the ways he finds to prolong the shelf life of what he buys locally.” \nChefs, farmers, and consumers see the farm-to-table movement taking off in Southwest Florida. \n“Over the last few years I've seen a tremendous growth in the farm-to-table movement by local restaurants,” said Birch, a member of the board of directors for Slow Food Southwest Florida . “Even the ones who can't sustain this practice on a large scale make an effort with farm-to-table specials on their menus.” \nHere are some of Birch’s and other local foodies’ favorites. \nThe Bay House , Naples Chef Andy Hunter says he “buys as much as they’ll sell me” from local farms. The multi-roomed waterside restaurant supplements local offerings to complement its seafood menu. The Farmer’s Salad changes daily to feature what’s freshest from local farms. \nChez Boet , Naples “When we opened our restaurant in 2003, we enthusiastically embraced our farm-to-table philosophy, which mirrors the philosophy of true French bistro cuisine,” said Lisa Boet, co-owner of the intimate cafe. Don’t miss the canard roti made with fresh local oranges and juice. \nCru , Fort Myers “We work only with Rosy Tomorrows ,” said Bob Boye, chef-owner of Cru, a wine and foodie haven that has set a new standard for Fort Myers in past decades. He loves the farm’s springtime wild arugula – with so much more flavor and bite than the hydroponic version. Try the Wild Spicy Arugula Salad with tarragon-blue cheese dressing and roasted beets. \nFood & Thought , Naples A by-product of long-time Florida growers Oakes Farms , Food & Thought makes creative use of the farm’s organically grown products in its juice bar, café, and market. Its ambitious selection of breakfast dishes, sandwiches and wraps, soup, and lunch and dinner entrees changes daily.
