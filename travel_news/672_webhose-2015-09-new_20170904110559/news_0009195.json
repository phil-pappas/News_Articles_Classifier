August is the most traveler-friendly season. The university's location is striking -- the glaciated valley of Longyeardalen, lapped by a serene icy fjord, in a tiny city entirely encased in snow-encrusted mountains.\nDistant gigantic glaciers glisten in late summer sunlight.\nMy visit is in August, the most traveler-friendly season for an 11-day circumnavigation of the archipelago by ship, departing from Longyearbyen.\nArctic studies\nCourses such as arctic geophysics, geology and biology are enticing natural science students from affiliated universities around the world for a four-month semester.\nUNIS is poised to offer its first full degree or masters program as part of planned expansion.\nFor many undergraduates, the Arctic is their first taste of practical outdoor fieldwork.\nIt's a key part of studies here, and the students I spoke to feel privileged to do it in such a unique setting.\nOne semester proves too little time -- many return for further studies or as professors.\n\"We've had midnight barbecues and hikes through summer's midnight sun,\" says Arctic geophysics student Tom Simmons, from England.\n\"I can't wait to see aurora borealis and perpetual polar darkness. I've already decided to apply for the spring semester too.\"\nArctic oil drilling\nStudy and adventure. An increasing number of students want both here. The frozen landscapes of the Arctic are drawing worldwide attention, with controversial drilling for oil having been scrapped as uneconomical by Shell , a move seen as a victory for environmentalists.\nClimate change conversation centers on this pristine yet fragile region.\n\"Given the beauty of the surroundings, I already feel connected to Svalbard,\" says geophysics student Stijn Van der Waal, from Holland.\n\"We've been hearing about climate change and it does unease me, as a scientist.\"\nResearch done by students here has the power to influence industry policy.\n\"Most university research is highly specialized to Svalbard,\" says UNIS information manager Eva Therese Jenssen.\n\"One student had his research, on thriving undersea life during winter darkness, published.\n\"A masters student presented his findings on the introduction of alien species from visitor foot-flow. They're now considering a cleansing procedure at Svalbard Airport.\"\nDog sleds and snowmobiles\nConditions couldn't be more extreme, with winter temperatures plummeting to -15 C (5 F) in a city with no road connections anywhere.\nLocals commute by dog sled and snowmobiles -- quad bikes on skis -- to navigate panoramic ice.\nStudent Paul Petersik, from Germany, loves it.\n\"I will get a snowmobile to travel beyond this settlement,\" he says. \"I love spontaneity with the outdoors and Longyearbyen is a dream travel launchpad.\"\nDay one at UNIS is unlike the start of university anywhere else.\nThe first lesson is safety, with firearm training.\nA rifle is required by law for anyone leaving Longyearbyen.\nPolar bears, the world's largest predator to actively hunt humans, can be encountered anywhere.\n\"We encourage students to independently explore this special region and equip them to be safe,\" says Jenssen.\nPetersik recalls an unforgettable camping trip by a frozen lake in the mountains: \"A polar bear had previously been sighted in a valley next to the lake, so we took turns staying awake to be on armed polar bear guard.\n\"One morning, I was late for uni as I was trapped in my barracks by reindeer outside my door,\" says geology student Svenja Rudolph.\nIt didn't put her off, she's applied for another semester.\nGlobal research hub\nNorway's government has injected subsidies into the last operational mines in Svalbard, which also maintains Norway's settlement policy on the Arctic archipelago.\nBut with whispers of closure, the region's prospects hang in the balance.\nThe university could be central in securing Longyearbyen's future.\nTalks have begun to potentially take over a coal mine barracks in nearby Svea, should the mine be phased out.\n\"If this happens, UNIS could expand facilities to become a research hub, attracting scientists globally to study the precious Arctic ecosystem and beyond,\" says Jenssen. \"The more we know, the more we can protect it.\n\"It would also mean jobs, tourism and more income.\"\nAt Longyearbyen, the world's most northerly university, lessons in survival are part of the curriculum. By offering further education programs and diversifying courses, the university hopes to raise awareness of the arctic environment.\nDuring my 11-day circumnavigation of Svalbard, I meet former UNIS student Mario Placidi Spring, now an expedition guide.\nHe took the yearlong arctic nature guide course.\n\"Tourists to Svalbard are well-informed, so the course taught me the 'hard skills' of multi-day excursions on glaciers and hiking, whilst educating guests on issues affecting the region,\" he says. \"It highlights the plight of the Arctic.\"\nExpansion for success\nTo make way for changes, UNIS is expanding both its main building and student accommodations.\nArctic 2030 is Norway's new grant scheme aimed at investment in the High North.\nIt's hoped that the the university will be central to Longyearbyen and its population, long after coal mining.\nResearch conducted by students would focus on the surrounding environment.\nFor the Arctic, it can't come soon enough.\nUniversity Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) , Longyearbyen\nApplication deadline for spring semester is October 15", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130425-longyearbyen25-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130425-longyearbyen25-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130620-longyearbyen3-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130620-longyearbyen3-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130425-longyearbyen25-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130620-longyearbyen3-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130249-longyearbyen23-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130620-longyearbyen3-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/09/28/cover-image.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130620-longyearbyen3-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130425-longyearbyen25-large-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130249-longyearbyen23-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130425-longyearbyen25-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130620-longyearbyen3-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130425-longyearbyen25-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130249-longyearbyen23-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130620-longyearbyen3-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/videos/2015/09/29/arctic-dog.webm", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130425-longyearbyen25-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130249-longyearbyen23-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130249-longyearbyen23-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130249-longyearbyen23-super-169.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/interactive/videos/2015/09/29/arctic-dog.mp4", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150929130249-longyearbyen23-medium-plus-169.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-30T22:04:45.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
