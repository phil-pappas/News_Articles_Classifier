At Hardy Amies, Mehmet Ali has developed a pattern inspired by the diamond flecks on climbers’ tube rope. At 3.1 Phillip Lim, the designer offered technical pieces based on climbing kit, and at Aquascutum, the house that outfitted Sir Edmund Hillary for his Everest ascent, new designer Thomas Harvey looked to the adventurer once more in a series of heavy-duty parkas and puffer coats. Star attractions A cosmic touch comes to menswear this season, with designers casting their eyes towards the night sky. At Neil Barrett pieces came printed with jagged, abstract supernovas (top left, £119, neilbarrett.com ); at Valentino, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli created constellations, galaxies and star formations over bomber jackets, tops and T-shirts (bottom left, £375, valentino.com ); and at Givenchy and Paul Smith stars burst over accessories and T-shirts. On trend this season: Polo Ralph Lauren's shearling coat and a Valentino t-shirt Shear heaven Designers mined the silhouettes and insouciant cool of the 1970s this season, with nods to Bowie-esque androgyny and the narrow jackets and flares of a young Mick Jagger.

Plush coats in the fabric came in dazzling hues at Burberry Prorsum, in swamping, oversized forms at Coach and in contrasting panelling at Polo Ralph Lauren (above, £2,170, ralphlauren.com ), with accents of the tufty stuff added to accessories and footwear too. Avoid the Del Boy connotations by keeping proportions neat; this Oliver Sweeney jacket is chunky enough to feel substantial against winter chills but looks sharp (and indulges your inner 1930s aviator).
