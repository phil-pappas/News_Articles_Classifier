As in previous years the Seychelles Tourism Board's Office for UK and Ireland partnered with Classic Resorts – one of Ireland’s largest producer to the Seychelles for the show which is held in the popular RDS centre in Dublin. \nThe show has over 250 exhibitors in attendance. The Seychelles Tourism Board was represented by the Marketing Executive for UK and Ireland, Miss Eloise Vidot – who was on hand to assist the Classic Resorts team to raise awareness of the Seychelles amongst the Irish public and to hand out first-hand information on the Seychelles. \nHaving attended the show for the past three years, Miss Vidot said that “interest in the destination at the show has notably increased. Visitors are now visiting the stand having already decided that they want to travel to the Seychelles and are merely looking for advice as to when to travel and which islands to visit.” She said that “this was very encouraging as it was a marked difference from prior years where many visitors to the show were not really aware of what the destination had to offer”. \nThis year the show welcomed in excess of 8000 people over the course of the two days making it Ireland’s largest Honeymoon and Wedding Showcase. The visitors were made up of brides and grooms to be, friends and families of the bride and groom as well as newlyweds. The show provides the perfect showcase for suppliers to promote their services to future brides & grooms planning their wedding & honeymoons – with all the services under one roof – from dresses, cakes, wedding venues and honeymoon destinations \nMiss Vidot said that “the sheer volume of people who visited the Classic Resorts stand indicated showed that the Irish people were keen to travel and their interest in the Seychelles was very reassuring. It shows that the efforts of the Tourist Office to work closely with its partners to boost visibility and awareness of the destination in Ireland and the UK is working.” \nEmirates Airlines and Etihad operate double daily flights out of Dublin via the Middle East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-28T12:21:40.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
