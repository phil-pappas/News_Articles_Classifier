Topping the list is a place in Norway.\nTheir acrobatic leaps, the sound of their breathing and the height of their blows, their huge size and complex song are some of the attractions these cetaceans offer to whale watchers positioned just a few meters (yards) away.\nTropical Costa Rican seas keep them from wasting energy to maintain their body heat, since the water temperature ranges between 25 C (77 F) and 28 C (82 F), which makes it ideal for reproduction.\nThe whales also head for relatively shallow areas to distance themselves from their natural predators like sharks and orcas.\nThat journey has given them the world record in migration for a sea mammal, with a total of 18,000 kilometers (11,200 miles) between the Arctic and Costa Rica’s Pacific coast.\nAlong the way, mother whales teach their calves to swim, hunt, breathe, breach and leap.\nThis species can soar completely out of the water, the reason for its fame as the most acrobatic in the world, and it also slaps the water with its tail as a form of communication and a way to exercise.\nFigures from the Costa Rican Tourism Institute show that the number of foreign tourists who went whale watching in Costa Rica has recently tripled, jumping from 43,302 in 2010 to 133,926 in 2014.\nAdult humpback whales measure between 14 meters (46 feet) and 17 meters (56 feet) long and weigh up to 45 tons, and have a life span of about 70 years.\nApart from the whales, the park also offers a great variety of other marine attractions including the pantropical spotted dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, sea turtles and many more.\nSource:- Visit Costa Rica", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T20:04:00.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
