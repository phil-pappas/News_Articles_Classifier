(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n171 CONNECT 106 TWEET 32 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Is there anyone reading this who isn't involved with at least one frequent-flier program? Didn't think so. Frequent-flier miles are embedded in our DNA. We struggle to acquire them through flying, through credit cards and through any promotion we can find. We boast about the \"free\" trips we get. And we keep coming back for more.\nBut many of us are getting a bit more savvy — maybe cynical is a better word — about frequent-flier programs. We're developing a sense that they aren't really as helpful as when we first enrolled. That the deck is stacked against us and the stack keeps getting higher. And there's plenty of evidence to support our cynicism.\nOccasional and somewhat-frequent leisure travelers may get hit the worst, but a word of warning to all you road warriors: Don't be too smug about your insider tricks and tips for gaming the system. The airlines have stacked the deck against you, too — and the house always wins.\nIt's the most one-sided contract you'll ever make\nWhen you enroll in a frequent-flier program and hit that \"agree\" button, the fine print you commit to is the most one-sided contract you'll ever enter.\nYes, those frequent-flier contracts are even worse than wireless phone or cable TV contracts. You agree that the airline can change the rules any time it wants without any input from you. One-sided contracts are called contracts of adhesion, and frequent-flier contracts are the super glue of adhesion contracts.\nThe airline actually owns 'your' miles\nThe worst of the one-sided provisions is that you don't even own \"your\" miles — the airline owns them. That's true even though it regularly offers incentives for you to \"buy\" miles it \"sells\" you.\nIn most real-life situations, \"buy\" and \"sell\" strongly imply change of ownership, but not with frequent-flier miles. That means you can't transfer them to anyone else (without paying a fee of more than the miles are worth). On some airlines, you can't even bequeath them to a surviving spouse.\nAnd if you do something the airline doesn't like — repeated use of hidden-city or throw-away ticketing, for example — it can nuke your miles and kick you out of the program.\nMost big airline programs favor business travelers\nFrequent-flier programs are called \"loyalty\" programs, but some loyalties are better than others. Big airlines know that they get something like 80% of their revenue from about 20% of their customers (or close to that; I've seen various estimates within that range). The 20% consists mainly of frequent business traveler \"road warriors\" who travel a lot and pay top dollar for tickets, so their loyalty is vitally important.\nOn the other hand, airlines also know that a large percentage of their lowest-fare tickets are bought by leisure travelers who choose the cheapest available flight, and the airline's view of them is \"loyalty, shmoyalty.\"\n'Free' trips are hard to score\nA study by IdeaWorks found that reward-seat availability for major North American airlines ranged from highs of 100% for Southwest, 91% on Air Canada, 87% on JetBlue, and 80% on Alaska; to 75% on United, 67% on American, and a dismal 58% on perennially low-scoring Delta.\nIn isolation, those figures aren't bad, but they overstate the real-world situation. They cover direct domestic flights in coach/economy between large airports. Real-world experience suggests that success rates are much lower in business/first class, especially on intercontinental trips, and on connecting-flight awards with decent itineraries.\nAwards are often hidden\nOn airline websites, award travel on \"partner\" airlines is sometimes hidden and not displayed. Also, miles required for a seat on any given flight may vary depending on which airline's program booking engines is used.\nOften, the only way to get a straight answer is to call an airline's frequent-flier office. And even then, you may get incorrect information. If an agent says \"no\" to a request, you may do well by calling back a few minutes later and talking to another agent.\nThe fees are outrageous\nYears ago, once you had an award ticket issued, you could change flights and dates as often as you needed, provided only that the origin and destination remained the same and space on your preferred flights was available. That's no longer true. Now, even a minor change invites a change fee of $75 to $150; you even have to pay up to $75 to change to a different flight on the day of travel. And if you cancel the trip completely, you have to pay up to $150 to redeposit the miles in your account.\nThese fees are nothing but gouges, pure and simple. If anything, they're even bigger gouges than change fees for purchased tickets. With purchased tickets, airlines can at least claim an \"opportunity cost,\" but changing a frequent-flier award costs an airline virtually nothing. After all, the seats are on a \"space available\" basis.\nThe fuel surcharges are crazy, too\nInternational award trips on most airlines based outside the U.S. (including even Air Canada) aren't really \"free\" any more: Most of those airlines impose a stiff \"fuel surcharge\" or an \"airline-imposed fee,\" which is just a fuel surcharge in disguise, on award travel.\nFor the most part, airlines based in the U.S. do not impose those fees, even when trips are on a foreign partner airline, but American socks award travel on partner British Airways with the fees. Those charges vary from a few hundred dollars to close to a thousand dollars on a premium class trip.\nFortunately, U.S. airlines do not impose those fees on domestic awards. At least not yet. But remember a basic rule of the airline business: Nothing catches on faster than a bad idea.\nMiles aren't worth their asking price\nMost independent observers place the value of airline frequent-flier mile at somewhere around a penny or a penny-and-a-half per mile. Presumably that's close to the price airlines get when they sell miles to banks for inclusion in credit card programs. But when they try to sell miles to you, the big airlines charge more than three cents — about two to three times what the miles are worth. They even charge up to one-and-a-half cents per mile to transfer miles you've already earned or bought.\nYou're better off buying a coach seat than using miles\nIf you generate most of your miles through a credit card, you're often better off buying a domestic coach ticket. These days, you can buy a round-trip ticket on most routes within the continental U.S. for less than $500. A long-haul trip generally requires at least 25,000 frequent-flier miles, so you'd have to charge $25,000 on your card to earn those miles. But some high-payout credit cards earn two miles per dollar charged, so $25,000 worth of charges would give you $500 cash back, enough to buy a ticket without worrying about award-seat availability.\nOverall, the \"highest and best\" use of miles is for premium cabin travel. The cash prices for those tickets are out of sight, so, for many, frequent-flier miles are the only escape from the cattle car into a comfortable flight. But if you're a more typical coach/economy flier, you are often better off buying a ticket and conserving miles for occasions when they're the best option.\nElite status isn't what it used to be\nFor road warriors, the most important frequent-flier reward is not so much the miles as it is the elite status that provides special check-in lanes, reduced baggage fees, and — most importantly — space-available no-charge upgrades. But even that benefit is eroding.\nAirlines are handing out elite status to more and more travelers, while they cut back on the number of first-class seats on typical domestic flights. These days, just about any departure gate with a display screen lists far more travelers eligible for upgrades than available upgrade seats. Only the super-platinum types can count on an upgrade; for the others, it's a crapshoot.\nREAD THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE: 10 dirty little secrets of frequent-flier programs\n171 CONNECT 106 TWEET 32 LINKEDIN 1 //usat.ly/1EXJFTY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/871a54efa9559840b3f8456e2277d9ac46b5bead/c=238-0-2120-1415&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774014647390062-ThinkstockPhotos-467573385.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EXJFTY&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635774014647390062-ThinkstockPhotos-467573385.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1EXJFTY", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1EXJFTY&text=10%20dirty%20little%20secrets%20of%20frequent-flier%20programs&via=usatoday", "http://www.smartertravel.com/travel-advice/10-dirty-little-secrets-of-frequent-flyer-programs.html?id=25274900"], "published": "2015-09-10T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-11T17:11:16.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
