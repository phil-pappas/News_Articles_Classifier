It will also assist those participating in the value chain of alternatives, such as batteries and supercapacitors, to understand the considerable opportunities for both collaborative use of their components with fuel cells and scope for common technologies.\nThese complex issues, vital to optimal targeting of investment by auto, chemical, financial, fleet management and other players are appraised in the report. Vitally, it is mainly based on 2015 interviews not out-of-date information. It presents latest conference slides from many key players and new data analysis and forecasts.\nThat means numbers for 2015 - 2025 and timelines to 2030 including the latest, revised predictions from the leading players and from the authors of the report. This is analysis not evangelism and all pros and cons are considered from a global viewpoint that takes into account the very different attitudes of governments and the very different resources of countries, carefully teasing out success criteria. The emphasis is today and in future not nostalgia from the past. There is a chapter on the background including legal, psychological, standards and other aspects, a chapter on the first commercial success - material handling vehicles, a very detailed chapter on fuel cell cars, a detailed one on buses, one on other fuel cell vehicles land, water and air and one on the fuel cell system manufacturers.\nKey Topics Covered:\n1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n2. INTRODUCTION\n3. FUEL CELL FORKLIFTS: THE FIRST VOLUME SUCCESS\n4. FUEL CELL CARS\n5. FUEL CELL BUSES\n6. FUEL CELLS IN OTHER VEHICLES\n7. EXAMPLES OF VEHICLE FC SYSTEM MAKERS BEYOND THE CAR FIRMS\n8.
