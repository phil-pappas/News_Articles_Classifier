But some organisations go above and beyond to give their employees a working week that reflects the way we live. Three years ago, Boris Johnson warned that the London 2012 Olympics would be “a skiver’s paradise”, but a flexible approach from the UK’s workplaces proved him wrong. The Institute of Leadership and Management canvassed more than 1,000 managers in August 2012 to find out how organisations had been affected by the Games. About two-fifths (41 per cent) of those surveyed said that they allowed staff to watch the Olympics in the office. They reported that employees bonded over the joy of a shared national experience, morale went up and, here’s the interesting bit, productivity increased. Those managers who allowed employees to work remotely or to change their start and finish times (some 18 per cent) all disagreed with the mayor’s assertion, saying that the event nurtured a more positive perception of working from home. That was the giddy summer of 2012 and a once-in-a-lifetime sporting moment. What about 2015, when it’s life as usual? Just how flexible are the UK’s employers? To some extent, they have no choice. As of 30 June 2014, all employees have the statutory right to request flexible working after 26 weeks of employment service. So now it is law, has flexibility become part of UK employer culture? According to a recent survey conducted by Britain’s Healthiest Company in which 32,538 employees were interviewed, just under half said they were now able to work flexibly, while just over half said they were able to work from home. All employees have the statutory right to request flexible working So although the survey revealed that 73 per cent of companies still don’t offer flexible hours to all their staff, the tide certainly seems to be turning. Sweaty Betty, a winner in the Healthiest Employees category (medium-size companies), believes a rigid attitude to bums on seats and working hours is a thing of the past. \"We trust our team and operate on a flexi-hour policy,\" says Jessica Howden, people and events co-ordinator. \"If a team member would rather leave earlier in the afternoon because of a long commute, they can start earlier in the morning. Our working hours are not set in stone.\" A winner in the Healthiest Employees category (large), Microsoft operates an \"Anywhere Working\" initiative that allows employees to choose where, when and how they work. \"It enables employees to work from home, in another Microsoft office or remotely, on an ad hoc basis,\" says Theresa McHenry, senior HR director. \"This flexibility allows people to choose their environment to fit the task at hand, or manage unexpected family commitments or transport disruptions.\" At Johnson & Johnson, a winner in both the Healthiest Company and Healthiest Workplace categories (large), there's a combined approach to flexibility. There are formal HR policies and benefits, and an informal, personalised approach that acknowledges that different requests for flexible solutions may come at different life stages. \"The obvious example is a new mum,\" says Clare Sicklen, HR director. \"Aside from traditional maternity leave, we also offer a flexible transition back to work, which we find really helps new mums and supports them with some of the emotional aspects of returning to work. We also have flexible working policies such as part-time working and job sharing.\" The approach clearly works. Around 90 per cent of women return to work after maternity leave. New mums are not the only ones to benefit at the company. Time and money could be saved if more employees worked flexibly \"Some of our employees have ageing parents who may need to be cared for,\" Sicklen says. \"In these situations, the possibility to change hours or work from home more can make a real difference.\" Seasonal flexibility is another area being explored. Sanofi Pasteur MSD, winner in the Healthiest Employees category (small), offers staff a half-day on Fridays in the summer, so long as they accrue the equivalent hours between Monday and Thursday. \"Manoeuvrability is the key,\" says Sarah Harman, the company’s HR manager. \"We believe in being flexible with the working week.\" As the returning mums of Johnson & Johnson show, flexibility breeds loyalty, which makes business sense. At Microsoft, McHenry is keen to show that the approach is an economic winner. \"Anywhere Working is led by a consortium of companies including Microsoft and endorsed by the Department for Transport,\" she says. \"It is designed to show businesses and individuals how much time and money could be saved by encouraging employees to work more flexibly.\" With the backing of the Government and inspirational organisations, flexible working may yet become the norm.
