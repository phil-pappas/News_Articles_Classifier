There are also plenty of other activities available, including tobogganing, snowshoeing and sleigh rides. \nThe area’s small Tirolean villages are full of rustic mountain charm and offer a wide variety of accommodation to suit every budget. In Alpbachtal, the pretty resort of Alpbach offers some challenging runs and has long been a British favourite. It is lift linked to Auffach in Wildschönau where you will also find the small resorts of Niederau and Oberau, which are a short ride away from Auffach on the free ski bus. \nWherever you decide to stay, Ski Juwel is a great place for families, with dedicated nursery slopes and children’s areas, friendly English-speaking instructors and family lift-pass discounts. \nSki Juwel and the Tirol Tourist Board are offering Telegraph Ski and Snowboard readers the chance to win a week’s holiday for two, worth £2,000, to Alpbach, including seven nights’ half-board at the four-star Romantik Hotel Böglerhof , six-day Ski Juwel lift passes, return flights from London Gatwick and resort transfers. \nThe closing date for entries is midnight on November 3 2015.
