The Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) Chief Executive Officer, Julie-May Ellingson and Esmaré Steinhöfel, Business Development Manager: International, were some of the women in the spotlight.\nAfter only being at the helm of the CTICC for just under a year…Julie-May has managed to grab both industry and main stream media’s attention and was bestowed the News Maker of the Year Award.\n“I am honoured to receive this award and will do everything in my power to make sure that the CTICC remains positioned in the minds and hearts of all locals and within the international markets. I do have to thank my wonderfully supportive and dynamic team who ensures that the CTICC is more than just a venue but a sustainable business that is indeed making its mark”, adds Ellingson.\nEsmaré was recognised as a thought leader transforming the industry and was nominated by industry peers as an influential role player, enabling her to scoop one of the Top 40 Women in MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) titles for 2015.\n“We are extremely proud of Esmare who has been a valuable asset not only to the CTICC but the industry as a whole. We are committed to empowering women and providing them with opportunities to evolve the industry. The CTICC is one of only a few convention centres in the world led by a nearly all female executive management team. Not to mention that 56% of the staff complement comprises women”, concluded Ellingson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-13T04:33:39.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
