Now's the time to take a plane or heli trip. Excursions leave Las Vegas or South Rim. Get your seats now. Read through this article. \nSummer is coming to an end, but that doesn't mean that it's time to stop having fun. What could be more fun than taking an air tour of the Grand Canyon? If you're thinking about heading out there, then there some things you'll need to know first so that you can get the best deal, and have the most enjoyable trip. It's Going To Be Hot! Even though summer is about gone, the temperatures are still hot at the canyon. It is hottest at midday, so you may want to schedule a morning or afternoon tour. Flying at sunrise or sunset is not only cooler, the sky is beautiful then. Helicopters are climate controlled, so you don't need to be worried while you are flying, but if you're taking a landing tour then make sure that you dress appropriately. You'll want to wear lightweight clothes and sun protection in the form of sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen. Superior Comfort In The EcoStar 130 When you book a Las Vegas air tour, you can fly on a state-of-the-art EcoStar 130 chopper. These Grand Canyon helicopters are designed for comfort and the best viewing experience. The comfy seats are arranged stadium style, and that means there are no bad views, so you'll be able to see everything without obstructions in your line of vision, and you'll have plenty of personal space for added comfort. You'll be glad you booked a tour on one of these helicopters when you see the massive windscreen that wraps around the front of the chopper giving you panoramic views. These deluxe Vegas air tours include free limousine transportation to and from your hotel. Deluxe helicopters depart directly from the Las Vegas Strip, whereas basic tours will require a standard shuttle service to nearby Boulder City. Las Vegas tours go out to the West Rim, and are the only Grand Canyon helicopters that can land inside the National Park. You can choose to go to the bottom of the canyon, or the top rim. Both options are fun, and if you have enough time, you can explore both areas of the West Rim. South Rim Tours If you want to tour the South Rim, or if you will be in Arizona instead of Vegas, then you'll need to begin your helicopter tour in Tusayan. These tours are a totally different experience since they fly along the North and South Rims. You can choose from two tours. One gives you a 30 minute flight and goes to the North Rim and circles back. The other tour option follows the same flight path as the 30-minute tour initially, but it also adds on a jaunt over to the eastern edge of the national park. The longer tour is almost an hour in duration, and allows you to see around three quarters of the park. You won't be able to land inside the canyon, but you can still explore by land when you take a Jeep tour that departs from Tusayan. This will give you an exhilarating ground level experience, allowing you to see some famous landmarks from a whole new perspective. Combining the Jeep tour with a helicopter tour is probably the best way to experience the South Rim. If you plan to be in Vegas, but you want to tour the South Rim, all you have to do is fly from Vegas to Tusayan by plane, which takes about an hour, and then you can begin your helicopter or Jeep tour. Book Your Tour Soon Grand Canyon helicopter tours are always in high demand and even more so as visitors try to squeeze in one last flight as summer closes. You want to book your tour as soon as possible, and if you do it online with your credit card, you can get a good deal. Paying online means that you will get the best available price, and your seats will be confirmed upon payment. If you're planning on taking a popular tour like the sunset or sunrise options, then you definitely want to book in advance. It's a good idea to get your seats at least two weeks ahead of time so you get the time and date you want the most. Touring the Grand Canyon is always an exciting adventure. Seeing it from the air is even better. Start planning your tour now, so you can enjoy a fun-filled summer adventure you'll never forget.   from ArticlesFactory.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR \nThe author is an expert on Grand Canyon sightseeing tours and recommends these airplane tours http://grandcanyoncheap.com/airplane-deals.html as well as these helicopter deals: http://grandcanyoncheap.com/helicopter-tours.html", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-25T16:33:17.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
