Hord made his greatest impact in Europe clashing with Roy Jenkins over the Commission’s continued sale of subsidised butter to Russia, after it invaded Afghanistan at the end of 1979. Hord co-promoted a motion to halt it, which was overwhelmingly carried. The Commission ostensibly complied, but when Jenkins, as its president, answered MEPs’ questions he disclosed that the ban only applied to butter in bulk; butter in packets was still being sent. A furious Hord retorted that as the butter was being sold cheap in Russia, Brussels was actually funding the invasion. He branded the Commission’s actions “inept, insensitive and totally unacceptable” and a “flagrant disregard of public opinion”. The following year he noted that Europe’s “butter mountain” had turned into a shortage. Hord discovered in five years at Strasbourg that, having castigated Labour for not taking advantage of membership, it was not easy to secure the benefits, or to call Brussels to account. One of three Tories who refused offices subsidised to the tune of £84 per day in the parliament’s lavish new headquarters, he argued that Europe was there to work for its people , not to spend their money. Urging British builders to pitch for more work in Europe, he noted that they were winning 6 per cent of contracts from the European Development Fund, while French firms took 43 per cent. Hord was briefly a whip in the European Democratic (Conservative) Group, and served on the parliament’s Agriculture and Budgets committees. In 1984 he blocked a move to harmonise taxes on wine, arguing that unless all drinks were covered, France could discriminate against imported spirits and dump non-vintage wines on its neighbours. Brian Howard Hord was born in Croydon on June 20 1934 . He left Purley Grammar School at 16 for the planning department of Middlesex county council, joining G L Hearn & Partners soon after to train as a surveyor. After National Service with the RAF, he moved in 1959 to United Drapery Stores; on Merseyside he found national building firms reluctant to bid for contracts because of the militant work force. In 1970, after four years with Costain, he joined the board of Capcount UK . In 1975 he went into private practice. Hord’s best chance of a Westminster seat came in February 1974 when, despite a national swing to Labour as Edward Heath’s “Who governs Britain?” election went sour, he cut Labour’s majority at Darlington to 2,069. He was less fortunate that October. In 1979 he fought the first elections to the European Parliament in the giant London West constituency, and took the seat by 22,240 votes over Labour. As the 1983 general election approached, he was one of several Tory MEPs who tried to find a Westminster seat without giving up on Strasbourg. He failed, then in 1984 also lost his European seat by 5,229 votes to Labour. Hord became a member of the London Rent Assessment Panel, chaired Bexley Health Authority, and for four years from 1991 was director-general of the European Bureau of Building Consultants and Experts. He was appointed CBE in 1989. In 1997 he was appointed to the watchdog London Regional Passengers’ Committee; he then chaired the Sevenoaks Rail Travellers’ Association and Bexhill Rail Action group. His campaigning helped to kill a Strategic Rail Authority plan for Bexhill to lose its all-day service to London, and brought extra carriages for the crowded line from Brighton to Ashford. Brian Hord married Christine Lucas in 1960; she and their two sons survive him.
