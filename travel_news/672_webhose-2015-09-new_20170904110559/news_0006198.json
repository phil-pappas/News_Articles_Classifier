(AP) â€” A new home for a museum that highlights more than 150 years of Nebraska's Masonic history is scheduled to open this weekend.\nRibbon-cutting and other ceremonial events will be held from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. Saturday at the Nebraska Masonic Museum and Research Library , which has been built inside the Masonic Grand Lodge building in Lincoln. The museum and library have been moved from smaller quarters elsewhere.\nThe museum and library are open to the public. Books, art, relics and other materials relating to Freemasonry have been accumulated by the Nebraska Masonic Foundation , which hopes to add to its 2,000 books on spiritual, philosophical and historical subjects.\nOther museum exhibits include a 3,000-year-old wooden setting maul from an Egyptian tomb, ancient weapons and a guide of Omaha's Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition of 1898.\nThere are more than 10,000 members in 134 lodges in more than 100 communities across Nebraska. The members help support two homes: The Masonic Home in Plattsmouth for elderly Masons and their female relatives, and the Masonic-Eastern Star Home for Children in Fremont.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-07T20:16:13.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
