Tiger Tiger, a much loved venue by corporate event bookers and agencies alike, has undergone a transformation. The 1650 capacity Super Club, located in the heart of the West End, has launched a new dining offering called Haymarket Kitchen and has opened its doors to a new nightlife experience called Luxe. \nThe refurbished venue hosts thousands of events per year for bookers looking for alternative large spaces in central London. The venue is frequently used by some of the UK’s most recognised brands including John Lewis. Luxe is the perfect addition to Tiger Tiger with a private entrance separate to the main club available to bookers. The space has a luxurious Vegas theme, ideal for product launches, company parties and team building activities. The new food and drink offering at Haymarket Kitchen offers a selection of casual dining options for daytime catering through to three course dinner banqueting options. Georgina Coleman, Head of Event Sales commented: “Tiger Tiger is one of our most popular venues within the group. The location, capacity and budget friendly venue plays host to some of the biggest corporate events in London. The venue attracts such a broad range of events both nationally and internationally, we wanted to invest in the site ahead of our Rugby World Cup bookings and the Christmas period.” The refurbished Tiger Tiger Haymarket site, is the fifth venue from the Late Night London collection to undergo improvements in 2015.
