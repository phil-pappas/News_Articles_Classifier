The park, which is bigger than Yosemite and Yellowstone national parks combined, is one of the wettest places on Earth, averaging 280 inches of rainfall a year. By comparison, Seattle gets 38.6 inches.\nAnd although there’s plenty of peace and quiet to enjoy while hiking, you may want ear plugs to block the sound of snoring from exhausted hikers in the huts that offer lodging along the Great Walks, which are routes featured by the country’s Department of Conservation for their “diverse and spectacular scenery.” Five of the nine Great Walks are on South Island.\nThe Great Walks are highly regulated by the Department of Conservation, which maintains the trails, checks for hiking passes, staffs the huts and presents nightly educational talks. The huts on the most popular Great Walks are large, clean cabins with bunk rooms. They’re a great way to be social with like-minded tourists and hear languages from around the world. I had fun teaching my bunkmates how to play the old-fashioned card game cribbage.\nKeep in mind when planning a trip to New Zealand that it’s in the Southern Hemisphere, where winter is June through August, spring is September through November and summer is December through February.\nOne of the Fiordland Great Walks, the Milford Track, is a world-famous four-day route. Hiking it requires planning as much as a year in advance if you want to visit during peak Great Walks season, Oct. 27-April 27. For other South Island adventures, it’s good to have some flexibility in your schedule as you’ll pick up tips on things to do from other hikers and the knowledgeable DOC staff.\nOne excursion that’s popular with hikers is an overnight cruise from Milford Sound. The boat’s all-you-can-eat buffet is a nice change from ramen noodles and other backpacker fare.\nThe crystal-clear water along the Milford Track makes it relatively easy to spot the freshwater longfin eel, featured on an episode of Animal Planet’s “River Monsters.” Elsewhere, watch out for backpack-eating alpine parrots called keas. They’re ever-present in high-altitude regions and they’re not afraid to peck at gear in search of food. Pack a headlamp, both to navigate the huts at night and for taking nighttime walks to look for glowworms, which are what they sound like.\nOther popular Great Walks include Routeburn and Kepler, but there are many quieter, less-advertised routes to explore, such as Dusty, Hollyford, Rees-Dart, Greenstone and Caples. If time is limited, many multiday hikes can be broken up into day hikes or one-nighters.\nThe hike to Mount Luxmore on the Kepler Track, just outside the quaint lakeside town of Te Anau, is a steep, challenging climb but offers spectacular views.\nFarther north, the rock scramble for a night’s stay at the Mueller Hut is a must-do for its close-up view of Mount Cook, New Zealand’s tallest peak at 12,218 feet.\nOn Stewart Island, a small island that’s a ferry ride or short plane trip south of South Island, you’ll find another Great Walk, the Rakiura Track. Rakiura’s 20-mile loop has huts as well as campsites.\nStewart Island is popular with wildlife watchers hoping to glimpse kiwis, the national symbol of New Zealand. But they’re nocturnal and can be hard to see in the wild. Guided kiwi-spotting tours are offered on the island.\nAt some point, you’ll want to swap hiking boots for sandals to walk the beautiful beaches in Abel Tasman National Park — home to another Great Walk, the Abel Tasman Coast Track — on the northern tip of South Island.\nFinally, pick up a bottle of wine from the South Island’s Marlborough region or grab a local craft beer brewed with Nelson Sauvin hops and prepare yourself for a trip to North Island, where a different type of magic awaits: the Hobbiton movie set from the popular “Hobbit” and “Lord of the Rings” movies.\nNew Zealand’s South Island\nWeather: Inland alpine areas of South Island can be as cold as 14 degrees in the Southern Hemisphere’s winter months (June through August) with July temperatures in Fiordland in the 30s and 40s.\nGreat Walks: www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and -recreation/things-to-do/walking-and -tramping/great-walks .\nDetails: newzealand.com/int/south-island .", "external_links": ["http://newzealand.com/int/south-island", "http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and%20-recreation/things-to-do/walking-and%20-tramping/great-walks"], "published": "2015-09-04T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-04T19:59:39.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
