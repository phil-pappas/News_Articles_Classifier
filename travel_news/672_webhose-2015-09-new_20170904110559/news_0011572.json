The idea, which is a brainchild of Abdullah Al Meer, Director of Business Development, was shared with Dubai Airports where it was warmly received,” said Ahmad Khalfan Al Suwaidi, CEO of the DTC. \nThe service if implemented will be the first in any airport or taxi operator worldwide. \nAl Suwaidi said officials from both entities are coordinating to review the requirements of implementation. \n“Under the initiative, the DTC will facilitate the check-in formalities when a taxi is ordered by a traveler to be picked up from home or place of work. The vehicle dispatched will have the equipment required to complete the check-in procedure such as a scale for checking the weight of the luggage, issuing the luggage tag, and printing the boarding pass,” said Al Suwaidi. \nHe added the service is being studied to maximise the level of satisfaction and happiness of travellers, as it will facilitate their travel procedures and minimise congestion at the airport check-in queues. \n“The initiative will thus expedite and facilitate the check-in process, and avoid any delay in the departure time. The plan covers examining all improvement potentials and taking different procedures to avoid any negative issues that might block the delivery of this service,” he explained. \nThe DTC manages 350 taxis deployed exclusively at the Dubai Airports in addition to 113 vehicles dedicated for VIPs, and 100 taxis for ladies and families, and seven taxis for the disabled. \nThese vehicles pick up passengers arriving in Dubai Airports to any destination in the UAE 24 hours a day. They have dedicated parking slots at Terminal 1, 2 and 3 as well as at Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central (DWC).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-08T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-08T18:49:14.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
