Photographer's Note \nLast Sunday I arranged with a friend to photograph the Supermoon eclipse and how far was the place we lost the moon rise and returned home. Around 11:00 PM another friend called us to see the Supermoon and I was already at home. I decided to pick up the tripod and go to my backyard with my son. I was not happy with the 18-135mm lens images from my D40 but managed to get this with Carl Zeiss Sony DSC-H3. It was not great but we were satisfied. I hope you enjoy.
