The state produces 99 percent of the extra-virgin olive oil in the United States and 4 percent globally, according to the California Olive Oil Council, a trade association. Many artisan labels are within a few hoursâ€™ drive of San Francisco and have recently opened their estates to the public.\nThe founders of the six-year-old brand Grove 45 in Napa Valley , Nena Talcott and Bonnie Storm, started private tours this year that they lead together. Guests stroll the groves, learn about the different olive trees and taste the oil in dishes at lunch. (Tours, offered through October, are $200 for two and arranged by emailing info@grove45.com. ) Also in Napa Valley, Round Pond Estate has small group tours of its orchards and olive mill. Sampling the nine kinds of oils it makes with foods like homegrown vegetables and learning how to use them at home are highlights of the 90-minute excursion. The cost is $65 a person.\nIn Transit Travel news, deals and tips, written by the editors and reporters of the Travel section.
