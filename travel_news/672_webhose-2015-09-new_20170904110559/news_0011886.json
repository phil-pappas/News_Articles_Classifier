Indianapolis-based Republic, which flies small jets for partners Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) and American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), in late August made what it called its 'last, best and final offer' to try to resolve a long-running standoff with its pilots. Republic management, in a letter to pilots posted on the Internet, warned that the alternative to accepting the deal would be far worse. 'The other path is a non-consensual restructuring in which we no longer control our destiny,' Republic wrote. 'It is a difficult and unwelcome choice, but it is better than remaining stuck at this frustrating crossroads.' Local union officials however chose not to send the offer to members, despite its promise of higher wages and contained healthcare costs, in part because of language that would have handcuffed future union communications with its pilots.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-02T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T21:30:30.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
