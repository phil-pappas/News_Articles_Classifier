So it did come as a bolt out of the blue last night.’’\nMatthews was confident Lillee would remain a part of the WACA family.\n“I expect Dennis to retain his place as an icon of the game and to attend games as he wishes to and to be a guest of ours at all our important events,’’ she said.\nLillee’s resignation is effective immediately.\nIt comes just two days before the release of a report on how much cricket should be moved from the WACA Ground to Perth’s new stadium at Burswood, across the other side of the Swan River.\nThe viability of the WACA Ground remains unclear, with the bulk of domestic and international limited-overs fixtures considered a chance to move to the new venue.\nNo other major Australian sport uses the WACA Ground.\nThe WACA’s future has been up in the air since their $500 million project to build high-rise apartments and a business precinct around the ground collapsed in 2013.\nThat failed bid ended up costing the WACA around $7 million.\nLillee’s resignation ends more than a decade at the helm of West Australian cricket.\nChairman Sam Gannon, who also started in his role in 2004, announced last month he would not seek re-election.\nGannon said Lillee’s resignation came “as a surprise”.\n“However, I was previously aware that he was contemplating resigning from the Board prior to the end of his elected term,” Gannon said.\n“I also reviewed my position after 11 years on the Board and thought it was an appropriate time to step aside and, accordingly, have not offered myself for re-election at this month’s AGM.\n“The Board will seek to get some clarification from Dennis on his specific concerns and we will continue to work openly with our Members, staff and the media in regards to all appropriate information, as has been the WACA’s deliberate approach throughout my time as Chairman.”\nLillee said the failed redevelopment of the ground wasn’t a complete waste of time and money.\n“The work has not been wasted, as the WACA has achieved planning approval for residential units and commercial space along with a significant increase in its land value,” Lillee said in the WACA’s financial report last year.\nLillee is one of Australian cricket’s most iconic figures.\nThe 66-year-old terrorised batsmen in the 1970s and ‘80s, capturing 355 wickets in a career spanning 70 Tests.\nMore recently, he played a key role in mentoring Australian pace ace Mitchell Johnson.\n Dennis Lillee quits as WACA boss", "external_links": ["http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/cricket/dennis-lillee-departs-waca-presidency-role/story-fnhq7arj-1227508982485"], "published": "2015-09-03T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-09-02T15:04:07.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
