With San Diego continuously ranked as one of America’s top microbrew cities, and the hotels’ reputation for offering genuine local experiences, the downtown hotels have created this package to give guests a behind-the-scenes view of the city’s Historic Gaslamp Quarter and its brewing craft beer culture. \nIn addition to deluxe accommodation at Kimpton’s premier San Diego hotels, the ‘Stay Crafty’ package includes two tickets to So Diego’s signature ‘Brothels, Bites and Booze’ tour, two local craft brews upon arrival and unlimited access to the hotels’ new beer concierges. The two-and-a-half hour walking tour offers an in-depth look at San Diego’s famous red light district, complete with stories on popular brothels and Prohibition-era gangsters, and food and beer tastings from some of downtown’s best restaurants and America’s top microbreweries, including Hotel Solamar’s Jsix Restaurant. Additionally, guests booking the package will receive a customised arrival letter from each concierge, detailing local craft breweries, personal recommendations, tasting notes and more. Jim Hollister, Director of Operations for Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants in Southern California and Arizona, said “Now home to more than 100 microbreweries, San Diego has become a major craft brew destination. This initiative is another way for us to offer an authentic local experience that appeals to travellers. We’re looking forward to our partnership with So Diego and sharing the urban history and booming craft brew culture with our guests.” The package costs from £193 ($299) per night including overnight accommodation in a Deluxe Guest Room.
